In 1997 Banca delle Marche became the parent company of the banking S.p.A. for 78.81% shares, with the rest were held by the banking foundation of Carilo.

Many of his statues decorate different central places all over Israel, from Metula in the north to Beer Sheva in the south.  Early life  Lifshitz was born in 1942 in Kibbutz Ma'oz Haim. He is the son of Israel (Srulik) and Lea Lifshitz of Shershevsky. He studied at the local school of Kibbutz Ma'oz Haim and served as a tankist at the Israeli Armored Corps of the IDF. Many members of the Lifshitz family are engaged in the arts of sculpture, painting, design, etc. Asaf is the cousin of the painter Uri Lifshitz. The author Dvora Omer is a sister of Asaf from his mother's side. Asaf worked as a metalworker in Kibbutz Ma'oz Haim and has been sculpting since his youth. He is an autodidact who has never attended an accredited school of art.  Artistic career  \\"The Drinking Pilot\\" ‚Äì the forefront of the Azrieli Center, Tel Aviv. \\"The Boy and The Horse\\" ‚Äì Ha'Shomer Square, Kfar Tavor. The majority of the sculptures of Lifshitz are outdoor statues made of cast bronze. Many of his statues depict playing characters and combine fantasy with reality, geometric figures with human figures. One of his notable works is \\"The Drinking Pilot\\", located at the forefront of the Azrieli Center in Tel Aviv. \\"The Drinking Pilot\\" is a statue made of bronze and stainless steel, which shows the image of the Israeli Air Force (IAF) pilots in a slightly different light. The IAF website describes the statue: \\"In 'The Drinking Pilot' Asaf Lifshitz tries to break the meticulous image of the Air Force pilots and shows the pilot when performing a daily activity of existence: drinking water straight from the tap. The pilot is half‚Äìdressed in his flight suit, his helmet lies on the ground and passers‚Äìby can just look at it closely, in contrast to the classic image of the pilot as a distanced and noble figure. Thus, Lifshitz gives humanity to the figure and creates solidarity in the viewer. The figure of 'The Drinking Pilot' is based on the pilot Major Boaz Gafni, who was killed at the age of 24.\\" In Kfar Tavor, about 11 of Lifshitz's sculptures are displayed, among the most prominent are: \\"The Boy and The Horse\\" statue, which stands at a Ha'Shomer Square in Kfar Tavor, and down the road the \\"Visit by The Rothschilds\\" statue stands in the Baron Square, which was created based on a photograph of The Rothschild couple visit in Kfar Tavor in 1914.

Concerns for marginalized individuals in an already-marginalized community include intercultural competence, the school-to-prison pipeline, and school expulsions. Activities aimed at providing safe spaces and support for LGBTQ youth of colour activities are generally held in libraries, schools, non- profit agencies and designated community spaces.Vaccaro, AnneMarie, Gerri August, and Megan S. Kennedy. Safe Spaces: Making Schools And Communities Welcoming To LGBT Youth. California: ABC-CLIO, 2012. Print. These activities, which provide practical sex education, mental-health support, empowerment and positive role models, usually require state funding as HIV/AIDS prevention.  Bullying  LGBTQ youth are two times more likely to be involved in cyberbullying and face to face bullying encounters, than youth who do not identify with the LGBTQ community. Bullying takes a toll on youth lower self- esteem, and lower GPA's have been reported effects of LGBTQ youth subjected to such encounters. Bullying that LGBTQ youth have reported being involved in include but are not limited to physical, verbal, relational, and sexual forms. Several youth who are a part of the LGBTQ community have reported having suicidal thoughts and actions as a result of bullying (online or in person). Activism through media Theater, drag shows and street theater have been used as resources for queer communities in response to LGBTQ rights, such as during the AIDS crisis in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s. LGBTQ youth of colour have been using performances to tell their stories, in addition to social media, video production, blogging, and podcasting. Media initiatives There has been an increase in media initiatives to include youth who identify as members of the LGBTQ community.http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/about-us/programs-and- initiatives/1067?task=view Many platforms have channels which can be considered safe or welcoming for LGBTQ youth of colour. = Hashtags = The hashtag #morecolormorepride celebrates the addition of brown and black stripes, changing the rainbow flag designed by Gilbert Baler.Gilbert Baker: The Gay Betsy Ross (video). In the Life Media. June 23, 2016. Event occurs at 2:31. Retrieved 2017-06-02 ‚Äì via YouTube. The stripes were added to make the LGBTQ community more inclusive and advocate against racial discrimination. Philadelphia City Hall pride flag The hashtag #VisibleMe was created to highlight stories from LGBT youth worldwide. The hashtag was used by a diverse community on a number of platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Many young teens shared their stories and created an Instagram channel. Movements such as the #40toNoneDay raised awareness regarding youth- of-color homelessness, particularly in the LGBT community. Sara Ramirez, who plays a bisexual doctor on Grey‚Äôs Anatomy, advocates the movement to bring attention to the 40 percent of homeless youth who identify as part of the LGBT community; LGBT youth are less than seven percent of the general youth population. = Blogs = Representations of, and expressions by, LGBTQ youth of colour can be found in blog posts. Author and transgender activist Janet Mock began blogging in 2010, and writes about gender, race and representation. Mock was named as one of Time magazine's 30 most influential people on the Internet. Her blog has a number of posts relevant to teens, ranging from bullying to the phenomenon known as Black Girl Magic. Black Girl Dangerous, a social-justice blog written from a QTPoC perspective, was begun by Mia McKenzie in 2011. The blog has featured over 300 queer and transgender writers who have contributed their voices to topics like the queer male gaming experience. With over seven million readers, Black Girl Dangerous ended its online publication on July 31, 2017. The social-networking site Tumblr has a number of blogs geared towards LGBT youth of colour, including Fuck Yeah Queer People of Color and LGBT + PoC. The blogs provide a space for LGBT youth of colour to contact other LGBT PoC youth. = Podcasts = With the rise in popularity of podcasts, the LGBTQ-of-colour community has connected with one another and discussed the triumphs and issues they face. In Louisville, Kentucky, Kaila Story and Jaison Gardner (two black members of the LGBTQ community) discuss a variety of topics weekly on their Strange Fruit podcast. Some, such as ‚Äúpolitics, pop culture, and black gay life\\", appeal to many youth. Nia King produces the podcast We Want the Airwaves, which focuses on queer and transgender people of colour (particularly artists). In an interview, King focused on fighting oppression of this marginalized group and raising awareness of queer and transgender artists of colour. The Trans Youth Equality Foundation funds a podcast, TransWaves, which emphasizes education, advocacy and support for transgender youth and their families. Focusing on popularizing the trans-child movement, the podcast has interviews and anonymous advice for listeners. = Advocates for Youth = Advocates for Youth, an online activism and resource portal for all youth, emphasizes initiatives for LGBTQ youth. One of its segments is Youth Resource, a website \\"created by and for gay, lesbian, transgender, and questioning young people\\" which encourages online peer educators to create an inclusive space. One of the most successful features of Youth Resource has been MyStoryOutLoud, a digital storytelling campaign for LGBTQ youth of colour to use technology to allow their voices to be heard and raise awareness of the need for safe spaces in communities. Using platforms such as Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram, LGBTQ+ People of Color can highlight their experiences in video or written narratives or other forms of art (including poetry and pictures). Another resource, Amplify (sponsored by Advocates for Youth) is an \\"online youth activism hub.\\" Advocates for Youth also has a cultural advocacy and mobilization initiative to empower youth through leadership training and encourage them to educate the community about safe spaces. Media impact Studies of racism, hetero- and homonormativity and positive role models for queer youth in media indicate that the lack of LGBTQ people of colour in media can affect LGBTQ youth of colour in coming out and their psychological development. According to the northwestern journal of law and social policy homelessness has risen over the years in the U.S., and homelessness has been addressed providing services and programs to help homelessness youth, however, these improvements regarding homelessness have not considered the differences among this population, the LGBTQ youth of color. According to Alone Without a Home, which reviewed state by state laws affecting unaccompanied youth, one of the biggest reasons for LGBTQ youth of color homelessness is that when the person decides to open up and say how they feel, their families turn against them and do not accept them; because of this, 20% of the youth have ended up leaving their houses. Homeless LGBTQ youth of colour rely on media (such as cellphones) for jobs, Internet access, resisting police harassment and documenting police misconduct.  Notable figures  = Transgender = Laverne Cox at the 2015 San Francisco Trans March Actress Laverne Cox, a black trans woman, has supported trans-youth rights on- and offscreen. With a spot on Time 100 Most Influential People List and an icon of LGBT History Month, she has used her fame and success to influence policy and increase acceptance. In speaking engagements and a documentary, Cox has created a dialogue for youth of colour and provided support and resources to her young transgender followers. In the midst of building her success, Laverne Cox was the first transgender woman to ever be on the cover of TIME Magazine. Then, most recently on July 10, 2014 she made history once more in the entertainment world when she became the first transgender actress to receive an Emmy nomination. = Gay and bisexual men = RuPaul became known for his drag-queen performances, his 1993 single \\"Supermodel\\" and the reality-TV RuPaul's Drag Race. On the show other drag queens lip-sync to remain in the competition, and it examines the issues of masculinity, male femininity, living with HIV, recovering from addiction, the transgender community and the fight for marriage equality. Hip hop singer and songwriter Frank Ocean released his debut studio album, Channel Orange, in 2012. Days before the album's release, Ocean used Tumblr to post an open letter reminiscing about his feelings for another young man. Frank Ocean Channel Orange received critical praise and six Grammy Award nominations. Def Jam Records co-founder Russell Simmons and other music-industry figures voiced support for Ocean. As one of the first openly-gay hip hop artists, he is credited with breaking barriers in hip hop and R&B; (which have had a history of homophobia).  Film and television  = Kiki culture = Inspired by New York's underground drag ballroom culture, Kiki is a subculture of the ballroom scene (which is spearheaded by LGBT youth of colour). Less formal than the ballroom scene, it provides a space for LGBT youth of colour to express themselves through performance and allows them to meet other LGBT youth. Kiki culture differs from ballroom culture in its focus on political and social activism, bringing attention to LGBT issues such as homelessness and HIV. It was brought to mainstream media through the documentary, Kiki, written by Sara Jorden√∂ and Twiggy Pucci. The band Scissor Sisters have also helped bring Kiki culture into the mainstream with their song, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Have a Kiki‚Äù which was released in September 2012 and was covered on the Fox television show Glee. = Documentaries = Laverne Cox‚Äôs Emmy-winning documentary, The T Word, focuses on the transgender community. The documentary examines the lives of seven teens and young adults who identify as transgender, sharing their experiences and daily struggles and focusing on campus bullying, attempts to change gender pronouns, family issues, relationships and sex. A second documentary examines the problem of youth homelessness in the LGBT community. About 500,000 youth experience homelessness, and 200,000 identify as part of the LGBT community; over 70 percent of homeless LGBT youth are people of colour. The documentary follows Beniah, Noel, Giovanno, Benjamin, Danielle and Zaykeem over and 18-month period; Noel and Danielle are women. = Characters = Shay Mitchell plays Emily Fields on the ABC Family series, Pretty Little Liars. Netflix's Orange Is the New Black includes a number of characters who identify as LGBT or question their sexuality in the penitentiary. Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) is a black lesbian who was open about her sexuality before her incarceration. During the series, she develops a relationship with Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn). Although Brook dated men before entering prison, she pursues a relationship with her fellow inmate. Sophia Burset (Laverne Cox) is a trans woman who is harassed and struggles to obtain her necessary hormones. ABC Family's Pretty Little Liars has a main character‚ÄîEmily Fields (the multiracial Shay Mitchell)‚Äîwho is in a relationship with a black lesbian, Maya St. Germain (Bianca Lawson). Emily later becomes engaged to Alison DiLaurentis in the series. The Netflix series 13 Reasons Why includes the gay Hispanic Tony Padilla (Christian Navarro), a main character and distributor of the tapes. Tony comes out to Clay (the main character) near the end of the season, mentioning a lack of acceptance by his Catholic family, and dates Brad (another character). Unique Unique Adams (Alex Newell) is a young black trans woman on Fox's musical comedy-drama television series, Glee, which aired from 2009 to 2015. Glee touched on the school's bathroom policy, shedding light on a transgender issue, and Unique offers pivotal support of Coach Beiste after his sex reassignment surgery.

She was the central figure of a famous criminal court case which has often been referenced in Dutch literature. She was originally the daughter of an innkeeper in Orl√©ans. In 1507, she married the Dutch noble Gerrit van Assendelft (1487-1558) and followed him to the Netherlands. The couple separated, but she was given an allowance, and settled in the Hague. In 1532, her spouse deprived her of her allowance. In 1540, false coins started to circulate in the Netherlands. The same year, two young Frenchmen moved into her house, and her neighbors reportedly heard the sound of metal processing from her home. On the night of 11 February 1541, Catharina de Chasseur and her entire household was arrested for coining. In the following trial, she was judged guilty as charged and sentenced to death by burning. Her sentence was reduced to execution by drowning by the regent.  References  * Serge ter Braake, Chasseur, Catharina de, in: Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland.

In Plato's Republic, Socrates is highly critical of democracy and proposes an aristocracy ruled by philosopher-kings. Plato's political philosophy has thus often been considered totalitarian. Critique of democracy In the Republic, Plato's Socrates raises a number of objections to democracy. He claims that democracy is a danger due to excessive freedom. He also argues that in a system in which everyone has a right to rule all sorts of selfish people who care nothing for the people but are only motivated by their own personal desires are able to attain power. He concludes that democracy risks bringing dictators, tyrants, and demagogues to power. He also claims that democracies have leaders without proper skills or morals and that it is quite unlikely that the best equipped to rule will come to power. =Ship of State= Plato, through the character of Socrates, gives an analogy related to democracy: he asks us to imagine a ship whose owner surpasses all those on the ship in height and strength, but is slightly deaf; his vision is similarly impaired and his knowledge of navigation is just as bad. He then asks us to imagine the sailors, all of which are arguing about who should have control of the helm while none of them have studied navigation. The sailors don't even know that there is such a thing as the craft of navigation. All the sailors try to convince the owner to give control of the ship over to them, and whoever convinces him becomes the navigator or captain. They manipulate and trick the owner into giving over the helm. The true captain, the one with the knowledge of navigation is seen as a useless stargazer and never becomes the helmsman. The true captain represents a philosopher-king, who knows the forms of justice and goodness. The ideal form of governance In the Republic, the character of Socrates outlines an ideal city-state which he calls 'Kallipolis'. =Classes in ideal society= Plato lists three classes in his ideal society. #Producers or Workers: The laborers who make the goods and services in the society. #Guardians/Soldiers: Those who keep order in the society and protect it from invaders #Philosopher Kings: are the most intelligent, rational, self- controlled, in love with wisdom, and well suited to make decisions for the community, and who promote the interests of the society as a whole. =Philosopher-kings/Guardians= Plato's ideal rulers are philosopher-kings. Not only are they the most wise, but they are also virtuous and selfless. To combat corruption, Plato's Socrates suggests that the rulers would live simply and communally. Contrary to societal values at the time, Socrates suggests that sex should not be a factor in deciding who should rule, so women as well as men can rule. Socrates proposes that the Guardians should mate and reproduce, and that the children will be raised communally rather than by their biological parents. The children's biological parents will never be known to them, so that no Guardian will prefer his or her own offspring over the common good. The children of the guardian class will be tested, and only the most wise and virtuous will become rulers. Criticism Karl Popper blamed Plato for the rise of totalitarianism in the 20th century, seeing Plato's philosopher kings, with their dreams of 'social engineering' and 'idealism', as leading directly to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin (via Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx respectively).Popper, Karl.

Their trademark is a portrait of the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf, who supposedly in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War stopped by the village Krostitz on his way to Leipzig. According to legend he there ordered the local master brewer to bring him a refreshing draught. As a sign of his highest esteem, the king allegedly gave the master brewer a golden ring.  History  Their brewing privilege was granted in 1534 by Duke Georg von Sachsen to Hans Wahl on the Crostitz manor. In 1738 the brewery sold barley beer (Braunbier). In 1803 malt liquor (Doppelbier) and Kovent (a low-alcohol beer made from leftover wort) were also being brewed there. From 1867 to 1876 both brewery and malt house were completely rebuilt, and another remodeling happened between 1894 and 1899. The sales figures of beer increased steadily and amounted to 1899 ; at that time a staff of 200 was employed in the brewery. In Leipzig 84 restaurants and 110 beer stores sourced \\"Crostitzer Lagerbier\\", \\"Dunkel\\", \\"Bohemian style\\" and according to season \\"Bock\\" or \\"M√§rzenbier\\". In 1904 the term Ur-Krostitzer was used for the first time. After the brewery was communized during the GDR period of governance, it became part of the Radeberg Group in 1990, since then there were numerous new constructions and conversions. Today the brewery produces Schwarzbier according to a recipe from an old brewing manual of the brewery and an off-dry Pilsner. In celebration of the 470 year anniversary, the Ur-Krostitzer Jahresring is given as an award to amateur historians, who concern themselves with the history of the regions Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia, since 2004. In 2006 the brewery employed a staff of 112 people, it produced around 374.000 hectoliters of beer and supplied roughly 2600 gastronomical institutions.

Built between 1969 and 1972, it is part of the Kings Quarter development that includes an outdoor pedestrianised area. Beneath a trapdoor in the centre is the Kings Walk Bastion, the remains of a 1,900 year old Roman city wall and tower. History Before it became a shopping centre, it was called Kings Street. This was primarily an industrial area and included a factory, which was built in 1873, for the printer John Bellows. This area was gradually commercialised with a lot of rebuilding done after the first world war between the 1920s and the 1930s. The north part of Kings Street was demolished in the 1920s when Kings Square was built. One of the largest commercial developments took place between 1927 and 1929 and involved the creation of The Oxbode and Kings Square. It also involved the demolition of the many buildings in St Aldate Street, Kings Street and New Inn Lane, making room for new commercial buildings. Kings Square was enlarged in the 1960s and the space was made for the Kings Walk Shopping Centre to be developed. In a large redevelopment of central Gloucester between 1969 and 1972 which involved Kings Street, Kings Square, Dog Lane and Clarence Street, shops were built on both sides of Kings Street and it was covered becoming pedestrianised indoor area called Kings Walk. Eastgate House, an Adamish stone fronted building, was demolished when the shopping centre was developed. A rooftop car park was built over the shopping centre. A pedestrian footbridge on the second floor spanned over Eastgate Street to link the Eastgate Shopping Centre and Kings Walk however, this has now been closed off. In June 2016, the investment firm Vixcroft made a bid to buy the shopping centre from Aviva Investors, who have owned the shopping centre since 1969, for ¬£25 Million. However, due to a clause in the contract regarding Brexit the deal fell through. In July 2017, Reef Estates approached Aviva Investments and successfully completed a deal to buy the shopping centre. In March 2018, it was announced that ¬£12 million would be invested to reface the shopping centre and remodel shopfronts in Kings Square and Eastgate Street. The work is planned to be completed by 2020. Kings Walk Bastion Sideways view of the trapdoor to Kings Walk Bastion in Kings Walk Shopping Centre The Kings Walk Bastion is a 1,900 year old Roman city wall and tower, located beneath a trapdoor in the Kings Walk Shopping Centre. The earliest part of the bastion is thought to be a Roman fortress built around 60AD. Originally the bastion consisted of a sand and clay rampart with a wooden tower and a defensive ditch. At the end of the first century, the fortress was decommissioned so a new city could be built. This was intended to be a Roman Colonia. Stone parts of the bastion were built in the 3rd and 4th centuries, from Cotswold limestone. This wall was approximately five metres high and three metres wide and made part of the wall that surrounded the whole city at the time. The fourth century sections of the wall consist of massive blocks of stone with small rectangular holes on the inside where scaffolding would have been set. A semi-circular tower was added in the thirteenth century on the outside of the wall. Archaeologists began investigations in Kings Square in 1934, where they found the corner of a Roman city wall and remains of a medieval tower 2 to 3 metres underground. The site under Kings Street and Kings Square was fully excavated by archaeologists between May and June 1969 before the redevelopment of Kings Street. In 1975, the site was opened to the public however it had to be closed in the mid-1990s due to underground flooding. In 2016, the Gloucester city council restored electricity to the site, installed a pump and lighting. Then on the 8 September 2016 the site was reopened to the public. It is thought that the remains of a Postern Gate are also located under Kings Walk but the exact location of the gate is still unknown.

History  = Creation of the gymnasium = This building was built between 1908 and 1910, on the impulse of the City Council of Bromberg, supported financially by the \\"Bromberg Shipping & Towing Company SA\\" (). The firm was very rich and influential in the city business, thanks to the river shipping traffic on Brda and Vistula rivers, having its seat in the LLoyd Palace at Grodzka Street 17. Gymnasium on a 1914 postcard Carl Meyer, a famous local architect, was asked to design the building. As usual at this time, he delegated the initial project to one of his collaborators, the architect Otto Brech. In Bydgoszcz, Brech also realized the building of School of Applied Arts (1910-1912) at Swiƒôtej Trojcy street 37. In 1911, the German institution opened at then Braesicke Stra√üe 8/11, first as a St√§tische knabenmittelschule (City medium school for boys), then as a Civic School for Boys (). = 1920-1939 = During this period, the building housed the Humanities High School for girls () of Bydgoszcz. On March 4, 1922, the school chapel was dedicated and in 1924, first students passed the Matura exam. Pupils were very active: they established in 1929, an association Summer Colony Society, and a permanent scholarship fund, in order to help their poor colleagues: it resulted in the construction of a holiday house, inaugurated on August 2, 1932. In May 1934, students edited a school magazine, \\"Girls in Uniform\\". From 1931 till the onset of WWII, Marian Turwid had been teaching drawing and arts there. = WWII = The edifice sheltered several institutions: * in 1939, a Polish primary school (few months) * a German school during the occupation * in 1945, a military hospital = Post war period = In September 1945, the building was taken over by the Municipal Secondary School. High School N¬∞6 was established September 1, 1948. Initially located at Olszewskieko street 20, (today Kordeckiego street), it moved in August 1950, to the current building at Staszica street 4. The newly school was the first in the region created by the Society of Friends of Children, a non-governmental association leading benefit activities for children (est. 1919). It was a year school for students from years 7 to 18. In 1950, associated with its move to new premises, the school changed its name to VI Gymnasium and High School. In 1958, the Ministry of Education approved its patron name, Jan and Jƒôdrzej ≈öniadecki, and its banner. From the middle of the 1960s, the institution turned exclusively to High school curricula. In September 1973, only High School N¬∞VI remained in the building. Copernicanum = Since 1990 = Most important developments of the facility took place in the 1990s. On December 6, 1991 High School N¬∞VI was admitted to the Society of Creative Schools (), an educational reforming movement born in the 1980s at High School n¬∞40 in Warsaw. It links today 30 high schools across Poland. The terms of reference of the TST association imposed the implementation by High School N¬∞6 VI LO of several rules, among which: * adopting innovation and organizational program developed by the TST; * having an educational program, both urban and rural; * organizing a club Promoting Talents and a Creative Teachers' Club; * opening grade \\"0\\" classes teaching in German; * developing an active participation of the teaching staff, and especially the director, in the work of the Creative Schools Association; * dissemination of TST teaching innovations in the region of Bydgoszcz. Since the 1990s, the High School N¬∞6 trusts high rankings in Polish competitions (and UNESCO's, Olympiads). Almost every year, it occupies the second place in the regional ranking and the first place in Bydgoszcz. In 1999 was established the Gimnazjum N¬∞. 50, as an institution within the VIth High School, and three years later (2002) the High School Ensemble N¬∞6 () was established, associating both institutions. For school year 2007/2008, ZSO nr 6 opened \\"academic\\" classes, teamed with University of Technology and Life Sciences in Bydgoszcz. On December 21, 2009, the rector of Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz (UKW) signed a cooperation agreement to create another academic class with ZSO nr 6. Classes of the Junior High School, focused on sciences (mathematics, informatics, natural sciences) participate in activities conducted by researchers of the University. Gradually, ZSO nr6 became an institution geared towards science subjects. Another innovative idea was the creation, in 2010/2011, of interdisciplinary classes in small groups (\\"Clubs\\") on Edward de Bono's concept. They coexisted with four other clubs: Economics, Humanities, Mathematics and Sciences, realizing cross-curricular activities. Those classes in clubs, developed in collaboration with UKW Department of Psychology, are thought to develop creativity, critical thinking and improve problem-solving skills. In school year 2015/2016, a polytechnic class was created, focusing on mathematics, physics and computer science, in cooperation with Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ (), Gda≈Ñsk and Universities of Technology. ZSO nr 6 keeps promoting its educational offer in relation with scientific institutions in the region, such as: * UKW Institute of Mechanics and Applied Informatics (in Copernicanum building); * The Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ; * The Faculty of Medicine Ludwik Rydygier in Bydgoszcz. The aim is to enable students to develop skills of creative research in scientific fields. Kopernika Street  Activities  High School N¬∞6 is a member of the eTwinning community of schools. eTwinning is an initiative of the European Commission aiming to encourage European schools to collaborate using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by providing the necessary infrastructure (online tools, services, support) to teaching staff. Teachers regularly take part to the Erasmus + programme. In 2015/2016, 18 members of the staff travelled in Europe to broaden their knowledge and hone their skills.

The plot comprises the building itself, but also outdoor sporting facilities (e.g. basketball and football pitches). The main building has a L shape, with its main facade giving onto Staszica street. The edifice displays late Eclectic features and is registered since 1992 on the Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list.N¬∞601432, reg. A/989, May 28, 1991 It is often associated with the neighbouring Copernicanum building, erected a few years earlier (1905-1906), also focused on pedagogical purposes. The 4-storey elevation on Staszica street presents two avant-corps topped with both different gables. On the right, the main entrance is accessible via a few stairs, flanked by two hand rails adorned with sculpted festooned urns. The arche shaped portal boasts round shape transom lights.

Early years and education Mary Adaline Edwarda Carter was born in Hinesburg, Vermont. She was the oldest child of Edward H. and Mary Adaline Kellogg Carter. Her parents were natives of Vermont, descended from the early New England settlers, of English and Scotch origin. Her early education was chiefly from nature and object study. At the age of eight, she attended private and public schools in Burlington, Vermont, and in Vineland, New Jersey, where her family removed in 1866. The years of country life spent in southern New Jersey during her youth were filled with formative influences that laid a broad and sound basis for her lifework. Circumstances and environments led Carter to finding occupations for herself, or to having them given her, that promoted inventive and executive powers and stimulated love for science and art. Thirst for larger opportunities and higher education developed, but adversities came, overwork, intense mental strain, then long and severe illness. After health was restored, she was by degrees led to industrial art as her vocation. Though beset by obstacles that would have turned aside one of less resoluteness, her course was progressive and largely successful. With simply the intention of becoming proficient as a teacher of drawing, she entered the Woman's Art School, Cooper Union, New York City. Career After graduating with highest honors, in 1876, her services were immediately required as a designer for embroidery. While thus engaged, part of her time was still devoted to art study, and throughout her years of working, she was a constant student in art and other educational subjects. In the Centennial Exhibition, in 1876, she made a special study of the needlework, art embroideries and textiles of all countries. Not long after, her watercolor studies from nature attracted the notice of John Bennett (1840-1907), the English painter of art-pottery, and she became his pupil and assistant. In 1879, a number of pieces of faience decorated by her were sent by invitation to the exhibition of Howell James & Co., London, England. One of her vases was presented to Sir Frederic Leighton, president of the Royal Academy, and others were sold to art museums in England, to be kept as examples of American art pottery. The same year, some of her work in faience was shown in New York, and won much praise. When the Associated Artists began their united enterprise which did much in revolutionizing and elevating household taste and interior decoration of American home and public buildings, Carter's services were secured by Louis Tiffany, and she was connected with them several years. At first having to do with all the kinds of work undertaken, glass, mosaics, metals, wood, embroideries, hangings, wall and ceiling coverings, painting or anything else decoratively used in buildings, she was the first woman thus employed. Later, having developed marked ability in plastic art, she had special charge of their pottery and modeling department. Her ornamental relief-work, panels and friezes were often used with heads and figures by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and combined with work by Charles Caryl Coleman, Maitland Armstrong and other well known artists in the decoration of public and private buildings in New York and different parts of the country. Her designs for memorial and other windows, for decoration of interiors and for different purposes were used in churches and homes, on both east and west coasts. =Instructor= Frequently, artists, draughtsmen, teachers and others sought instruction from her in special subjects. At different times, she taught classes of children in drawing, and in the Woman's Art School one in porcelain painting. Since 1886, she was instructor of the free classes in clay-modeling, applied design and normal training in form-study and drawing for the Young Woman's Christian Association of New York. The courses of study in those classes and all accessories were planned and carried out by her. Personal life From about 1880, Carter resided with her family in the upper suburban part of New York City. She was a staunch member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

It is made up of bands of subalpine forest and meadow that are created when deep snow and wind forces trees to grow only in bands, about twenty feet wide and thirty feet apart, that have enough shelter. Areas that have this habitat type include the southern Mount Zirkel Wilderness and the Medicine Bow Mountains. Not surprisingly, these areas get some of the Southern Rockies' largest amounts of snow. The area between Mad Creek and Buffalo Pass in the southern Park Range has Colorado's highest amount of snowfall, averaging 25 to 30 feet per winter.  Russia  Kulunda Steppes, Altai Krai. The dark east-west strips are examples of ribbon forest, forested with pines and dotted with salt-rich lakes. The image shows a distance of a little more than from left to right, and the forested strips are nearly that length. In Russia, the term \\"Ribbon forest\\" or \\"Tape forest\\" refers to a more large-scale phenomenon of long, narrow bands of forest stretching from northeast to southwest in Siberia. These bands can be 100 miles long and less than 2 miles wide.

Language The Anƒìwan language, also known as Nganyaywana has been classified by Robert M. W. Dixon as belonging to the Djan-gadi/Nganjaywana subgroup of Central New South Wales, and was one of three varieties of the group, the other dialects being Himberrong and Inuwon. For a long time Anƒìwan was regarded, like Mbabaram, as a linguistic isolate, ostensibly failing to fit into the known Australian patterns of language, since the material in word-lists taken down of its vocabulary appeared to lack cognates in contiguous languages such as Gamilaraay. The status of its seeming irregularity was solved in 1976 by Terry Crowley who showed that the differences were caused by initial consonant loss which, once accounted for, yielded up over 100 cognate terms between Anƒìwan and other languages and dialects of the region. One of the peculiarities generated by this phenomenon of initial loss was that many homophones were created between originally distinct words, so that in Anƒìwan the word for goanna and bull ant became identical (janda). Country The Aniwan tribe occupied much of the New England area in New South Wales According to Norman Tindale, the Anƒìwan's traditional lands measured some , spreading over the New England tableland from Guyra and Ben Lomond south to Uralla and the Moonbi Range. Northwest their borders ran to Tingha, and encompassed also Bendemeer and Armidale. Neighbouring tribes were the Baanbay to their east; the Djangadi to the south- east, the Yugambal and Ngarabal to their north, and the Gamilaraay to the west. Social structure The Anƒìwan consisted of several clans, one of which was the Himberrong horde. Their section names were: * Irong feminine Arkan * Arpong feminine Iran * Iyong feminine Patjang * Imbong feminine Irakena. The Irong intermarried with the Iyong, and the Arpong with the Imbong. History By the time R. H. Mathews began to record elements of the Anƒìwan language in 1903, remnants of the original tribe had been widely dispersed over New England. Those who remained in Armidale lived on a site on the town fringes known as \\"The Dump\\", in humpies built close to the rubbish tip, which were devoid of the basic amenities of water, sewerage and electricity, and jerry- rigged by using hessian bags, corrugated sheet iron and cardboard boxes. In 1960 4 children died and 11 were hospitalized from infections picked up in conditions that were called \\"appalling\\". The government then allocated funds to clean up the area and built cottages in fibro cement for its residents. Eventually, these were replaced by brick units in a settlement which the local Aboriginal community named Narwan.

Though some aspects of its accuracy have been questioned since then, it is widely used today, especially by SAD researchers. TOC Description The SPAQ is a screening instrument for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a recurrent major depressive disorder that typically affects its victims during the fall and winter months. It was first developed by American psychiatrist Norman E. Rosenthal and his National Institute of Mental Health colleagues in 1984, and continues to be widely used. It is a self- administered paper-and-pencil test that is freely available in the public domain. The SPAQ can be downloaded. The questionnaire asks subjects to score the amounts of seasonal changes they have experienced in sleep, socialization, mood, weight, appetite and energy. A global score between 0 and 24 is gotten by adding up the scores on each of these items. Subjects also specify the months during which these changes are greatest and least. Subjects are also asked rate their overall seasonal impairment from \\"no problem\\" to \\"disabling\\". Subjects are often taught how to interpret their scores, and cautioned that a self-assessment can never substitute for a clinical evaluation. If their score on the SPAQ is high, they are advised to consult their physician. Reliability, validity, and specificity Numerous studies have been done to assess the usefulness of the test. In general, it has been found to be reliable (in that it yields consistent measurements) and valid (in that it measures what it purports to measure). It has also been found to have low specificity (in that people who have other forms of depression can score as if they have SAD). This could give misleadingly high estimates of the prevalence of SAD. Some studies have questioned the overall validity of the SPAQ, and even the concept of SAD itself. In spite of its shortcomings, the SPAQ is still a very popular screening tool in SAD research. This is true because of its early development, historically wide dissemination, and the absence of better-validated alternatives.

He was an Indian Administrative Service officer of Assam-Meghalaya cadre. He was the first person from Assam to be directly recruited to the IAS as well as the first Scheduled Tribe IAS officer in India when he cleared the civil services examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission in 1954.. He belongs to the Biate tribe of Northeast India. Early life and education Jamchonga Nampui (2 June 1926 ‚Äì 2 November 1988) was born in Thuruk, a medium size Biate village in present-day Meghalaya which was then a part of Assam, to Somlalkhupa and Roichongbuangi Nampui. Jamchonga was the eldest of seven brothers and two sisters in his family. Two years after his birth, his parents moved to Mualdam, a village in North Cachar Hills (Dima Hasao) where he spent his childhood days. In 1935, as there was no school in Mualdam his father took him to Haflong where he was enrolled in Haflong Welsh Mission L.P. School (now Government Boys Higher Secondary School) in the same year. From his school years, Jamchonga was a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. In 1942, after passing Middle Class (Class VI), he was sent for further studies to Shillong (the then capital of Assam) as Haflong during those days didn't have any school that provided higher studies beyond Class VI. In Shillong, he got admitted to the Government High School, Mawkhar. During this period, particularly during 1945-46, young Jamchonga was actively involved in freedom movement activities against the British Raj, at a time when the demand for freedom was at its greatest strength in the country. This zeal, however, affected his studies and as a result, he could not clear his matriculation examination in 1946. Jamchonga returned to Haflong in 1946 where he stayed till 1950 doing several jobs to earn a living. Although he was now earning, his love for education and learning didn't die. So he decided to give the matriculation examination again in 1950 from Government English High School (now Government Boys Higher Secondary School) and this time he passed the exam with a first division. He then moved to Shillong again and took admission in St. Anthony's College . During this period, he used to work as a clerk in the Governor's Secretariat during the day and attend night classes. In spite of many odds, he passed his Bachelor of Arts (BA) with distinction from St. Anthony's College securing the overall rank of 8th position under Gauhati University in 1954. After his graduation, he decided to sit for the civil services examination and in his very first attempt cleared the examination securing a merit ranking of 64th position and was selected for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Career Jamchonga Nampui first posting as a civil servant was as Assistant Commissioner, Naga Hills of undivided Assam on 2 May 1956 on probation. In a career spanning 32 years, he went on to serve as Assistant Commissioner, Lakhimpur and Sivasagar districts, Deputy Commissioner of Mizo Hills (now Mizoram) and Cachar districts and also as Commissioner, Transport and Commissioner, Excise, Assam. He then went on to become Chairman, M.S.E.B, Meghalaya, Joint Secretary, Revenue and Forest Department, Assam and subsequently Secretary to the Government of India, Information & Broadcasting, New Delhi. He was appointed twice as the Chief Secretary of Meghalaya in 1980 (13.05.1980 - 26.08.1983) and then again in 1985 (1.07.1985 - 19.08.1985). After this, Jamchonga was then appointed as the Chief Secretary of Assam (14.02.1986 - 01.11.1986), a post he held till his retirement. He retired on 1 November 1986. He was, however, appointed again as Honorarium in Vice Chairman, State Hills Areas Planning Board with the status of Minister of State for a brief period after his retirement by the Government of Assam. Death Shortly after he retired from service, Jamchonga Nampui died on 2 November 1988 at his residence \\"Ivory Cottage\\" in Mawkhar, Shillong. Personal life Jamchonga was the eldest of seven brothers and two sisters born to Somlalkhupa and Roichongbuangi Nampui. Other notable siblings include Luaia Nampui, a retired Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer who now resides in Guwahati. Jamchonga Nampui married Minne.E. Nampui in 1954. They have two sons and three daughters. One of his daughters, Merrylin Nellie Nampui is also today an IAS officer. Commemoration To honor Jamchonga Nampui and to take forward his legacy \\"to strive for the best in education\\", a school in Fiangpui, Assam, District Council L.P. School, established in 1962, was renamed as J.C. Nampui Memorial L.P. School in 1990 after him.

The department was also formed when Overland Park became a \\"first class city\\". Tragedy first affected the Overland Park Police Department on January 19, 1968, when a Kansas Highway Patrol Sergeant, Eldon K. Miller, was shot and killed in Overland Park. The incident began with a bank robbery in Overland Park and during the robbery an Overland Park Police motorcycle officer was wounded and the suspects were then found in an apartment complex when officers found the getaway vehicle used in the robbery. Following the discovery officers set up a perimeter around the apartment complex and Trooper Miller hopped in a Johnson County Sheriff's Office patrol car and used the patrol car to cover other officers from gunfire, as he was moving the vehicle the suspects started shooting and gunfire hit Trooper Miller in the head killing him immediately.

She was one of the first women to open a photographic studio, located at 6, Alcaiceria Street in Mexico City. At the time, there were 30 women photographers in Mexico, in comparison to the hundreds of women working as photographers in the United States. The Mexican historiography has considered her one of the first Mexican photographers. Shanti Lesur, Baquedano's niece great-granddaughter, has made an independent effort to rescue and study the work of this photographer. The Shanti Lesur Archive is at the moment the most complete source of original materials. During 2007, Shanti Lesur organized an exhibition about the work of this photographer in the Cuauhnahuac Regional Museum, located in the Palace of Cortes, in the city of Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico. As Bartra and Monroy have pointed out, the case of Baquedano is relevant since she preferred to study and work than becoming, as the great majority of women on her time, to become a mother and a wife. She opened one of the first studios where women worked in Mexico. She also created innovative photographic processes. Biography Bartra points out that Baquedano was born in the city of Quer√©taro in 1872. Her parents were Francisco Baquedano, owner of a food packing plant, and Isabel Hurtado, who had four other daughters. Rodr√≠guez indicates that Baquedano began her artistic training at the city of Quer√©taro \\"under Direction of Mr. Almaraz in the fields of drawing, painting and sculpture.\\" Monroy points out that Baquedano became independent from her family when she was young, traveling and establishing herself in Mexico City to enter the National Art School, probably between 1895 And 1897, something really atypical at the end of the 19th century. Both Bartra and Rodr√≠guez provide data concerning the photographic study founded and operated by Natalia Baquedano: the first states that it was located on Calle Alcacer√≠a No. 6, corner of \\"5 de Mayo\\", and the second that it was opened in 1898 along with a partner, A Rico, under the name National Photography. In addition to these biographical data, it is known that Baquedano did not marry or have any children, and that she died in 1936 at the age of 64. Work Both Bartra and Rodriguez point out that Baquedano was mainly devoted to portrait. Rodr√≠guez cites an announcement of National Photography that indicated the type of work done in this one: \\"photography on platinum paper, albumin, silk, porcelain, metal and everything that can be applied photographs. - Illuminations on oil mirrors and watercolor. - Portraits, views and groups outside the workshop. Conventional prices. Amplifications of all sizes, direct or taken from any portrait, however small, guaranteed the likeness.\\" (Rodr√≠guez, op. cit). This document also announced a \\"Newness\\": the\\" photograph on natural flowers\\", an invention of Baquedano, which won her a celebrity, patenting it in her name and giving Carmen Romero Rubio de Diaz (wife of the Mexican President at the time) a bouquet of flowers with this ephemeral art. Rodriguez mentions that her work was \\"on the tone of his contemporaries\\". In his publication, there is one reproduction of one of Baquedano's studio photographs: a group portrait of the Founding Commission of the Astronomical Society of Mexico, ca. 1900. Both Rodr√≠guez and Bartra point out that, in addition to the individual or group portraits made in the Baquedano photographic studio, the artist also made some similar compositions to appearances \\"that seem taken from everyday life (the image of her parents, elegantly dressed, drinking beer), or merely theatrical (a child sitting on the moon, another as an angel) and even playful compositions. She also made pictures of dead infants, something common at the time, but she would place the body next to a skull. According to Bartra, the Shanti Lesur Archive is composed almost entirely of portraits of the photographer's family, most notably the portraits of her sister Clemencia. Natalia Baquedano is an important source of the female portraits since she had a special predilection of portraying women. What it is outstanding in Baquedano's art is that she does not portrait female characters as it was usually done on her time. The daguerreotypes, nitrocellulose flexible film negatives, glass plates and paper prints, show a playful and not stigmatized universe.  Scholarship on Natalia Baquedano and early women photographers in Mexico  Historians such as Eli Bartra, Rebeca Monroy Nasr and Jos√© Antonio Rodr√≠guez have studied her work. Some articles in different magazines (Pol√≠tica y Cultura, UAM Xochimilco; Alquimia) and article in the book Fot√≥grafos en M√©xico (1872-1960) are the closest to a biography.

History The concert hall was built from 1911 to 1913 in a neo-baroque style according to the plans of the architect Max Littmann. Prince regent Luitpold of Bavaria commissioned the construction of the Regentenbau. The building was inauguratet by his son and successor Ludwig III of Bavaria on 15 and 16 May 1913.http://www.infranken.de/regional/bad-kissingen/Bad-Kissinger- Regentenbau-ist-jetzt-100-Jahre-alt;art211,434936 The owner is the state of Bavaria. The Regentenbau is under monument protection and is registered under the number D-6-72-114-38. Situated between the Kurgarten (spa garden) and the river Fr√§nkische Saale, the Regentenbau completed the spa area of Bad Kissingen. It was the conclusion of the comprehensive building contract in the royal spa, which Luitpold of Bavaria had given in 1905 to Max Littmann as \\"special commissioner for the state's new buildings in the royal spa garden\\".Walter Beck: 'Bayern und Sachsen. 2004, p. 245 This order, for which the Bavarian government released funding in 1910, included also the construction of the Wandelhalle (promenade hall) and the renovation and structural integration of the older Arkadenbau of Friedrich von G√§rtner, a 200-meter-long arcade building from 1838 with its hall Conversationssaal (today Rossini-Saal), to the Regentenbau. From the opening until 1918 the Vienna Symphony as the saisonal spa orchestra performed its evening concerts at the Regentenbau. The Munich Philharmonic followed from 1919 to 1942. Then musical life ended because of the Second World War.Thomas Ahnert: Die Kur macht die Musik. In: Thomas Ahnert, Peter Weidisch: 1200 Jahre Bad Kissingen 801-2001.

After the war the Regentenbau was occupied by the American troops for two years.https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/travel/where-princes- took-the-waters.html Musical life started again in 1950 with the Hofer Symphoniker (until 1979). Since 1986 the Regentenbau is the main location of the festival Kissinger Sommer. From 2003 to 2005 the Regentenbau was completely renovatet.Generalsanierung des Regentenbaus in Bad Kissingen in: Baukultur, No. 5/2007, p. 27f.  The halls  = Max-Littmann-Saal (Max Littmann Hall)= The Max-Littmann-Saal was originally called Gro√üer Saal (Great Hall). After the end of renovation in 2005 it was officially renamed after the architect Max Littmann. The hall of about 455 square meters is 36 meters long, 16 meters high and is surrounded by a large U-shaped gallery. In the case of row seating, the hall accommodates a maximum of 1,160 guests, in the parquet about 660 and on the gallery about 500 seats. It is used for concerts, but also for conferences. Experts count it to the best concert halls of the world.https://www.welt.de/kultur/article160705649/Die-20-schoensten- Konzertsaele-der-Welt.html The paneling of cherry-wood gives the hall, which is of the ‚Äúshoebox type‚Äù, a much acclaimed acoustics. Behind the panelling a gap of five to ten centimeters to the wall acts as resonance space. Measurements during the renovation of 2005 brought reverberation times of 1.1 to 1.8 seconds. These acoustics are similar to the Boston Symphony Hall or the Usher Hall in Edinburgh.http://www.mainpost.de/regional/bad-kissingen/Akustik- Konzertsaele-Usher;art766,7388699 So the Max-Littmann-Saal often was used for recordings of classical music. In the recent past the Philharmonie Festiva and the conductor Gerd Schaller produced CD recordings of symphonic works of Anton Bruckner,http://www.musicweb- international.com/classrev/2015/Aug/Herbeck_mass_PH15003.htm Johannes Brahms, and Franz Schubert,https://www.allmusic.com/performance/3-scherzo-allegro- mq0002072889 as well as the first recordings of the opera Merlin by Carl Goldmarkhttp://classicalsource.com/db_control/db_cd_review.php?id=8315 and the Great Mass by Johann Ritter von Herbeck. Many concerts of the Kissinger Sommer are recorded in the Max-Littmann-Saal by the public broadcasting company Bayerischer Rundfunk. The hall is connected to the neighbouring halls Gr√ºner Saal and Wei√üer Saal by big foldable doors, which make it possible to enlarge the capacity of the Max-Littmann-Saal. =Gr√ºner Saal (Green Hall)= The hall in art nouveau style was thought to be a room for chamber music. It is 21 metters long and 8,5 meters wide and has 120 seats. =Wei√üer Saal (White Hall)= The hall in rokoko style of about 150 square meters and a capacity 100 places is also used for small concerts. On one side it is connected to the Littmann-Saal with three-meters-high mirror doors, while glass doors lead to the Schmuckhof on the other side. =Schmuckhof (Courtyard)= The Schmuckhof, built in the neo-baroque style, is a small inner courtyard between the White Hall, the 150 square meter Salon am Schmuckhof (110 people in rows) and the adjacent reading rooms. It leads to foyer of the Rossini-Saal. =Rossini-Saal (Rossini-Hall)= Littmann transformed the old Conversationssaal (Conversation Hall) of Friedrich von G√§rtner and created an additional stage. It is also used for smaller concerts. 280 people can sit in the hall with its 330 square meters. After the general renovation around the year 2000 the hall was renamed Rossini-Saal after the composer Gioachino Rossini, who has visited Bad Kissingen as a spa guest in 1856.

Business career In 1983, Fuller co-founded the Monitor Group, a consulting firm, with his brother Mark and HBS colleague Michael Porter. From 1994 to 2006, he was the chief executive officer of its commercial consulting operations. The company went bankrupt in 2013, and later became known as Monitor Deloitte.

He has authored business cases about Terrapin Laboratory, Loki Capital Management, DaVita Inc., MuMat√©, H√∂vding, GenapSys, HourlyNerd, and Saudi Aramco. He has published research about dividend policy, income inequality and the skills gap. With Michael C. Jensen, Fuller argued that dividend policy was critical to solving the politics of agency costs between shareholders and senior executives. As a result, they agreed with Richard C. Breeden, the former chairman of the SEC, that companies should give high dividends to their shareholders annually to make sure their investments were based on dynamic capital market returns and avoid wasting resources on unnecessary investments or extravagant compensations. Fuller suggested that educators and employers would have to work together to address the skills gap. With his colleagues Jan W. Rivkin and Karen Mills, Fuller argued that fostering shared prosperity would entail the collective impact of leaders in \\"government, business, education, nonprofits, labor, philanthropy\\" and other sectors. With Matthew Sigelman, Fuller argued that the Trans-Pacific Partnership could not explain high unemployment rates and low wages in the United States; instead, globalization led to a skills gap and the US workforce needed to be retrained to fill new highly skilled jobs. Taking the example of J.P. Morgan, which announced they would train their employees to make sure they could be promoted, Fuller and Sigelman encouraged US companies to do the same, adding that such an investment would foster soft skills. In the wake of Donald Trump's victory, Fuller argued the skills gap would have to be tackled. To do this, Fuller suggested the United States Department of Education should broaden the scope of Pell Grants to enable non-traditional college students in programs co-sponsored by a company to qualify; make it mandatory for colleges to disclose their graduation rates; encourage apprenticeships; review accreditation standards.

It is notable for granting Scottish ministers the power to force the sale of private land to community bodies to further sustainable development in the absence of a willing seller. Provisions Under the provisions of the Act there is to be a ‚ÄòLand Rights and Responsibilities Statement‚Äô, setting out the Scottish Government‚Äôs objectives for land reform, a Scottish Land Commission is to take forward the land reform process, preparing a strategic plan, for the approval of Scottish ministers. One of the new land commissioners is to be a Tenant Farming Commissioner who must be neither an agricultural landlord nor a tenant but who is to be responsible for reviewing issues relating to tenant farming. A further provision is the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and extended by the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015, the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows crofting communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis. Other provisions of the act include new regulations to require persons who control land to be identified, with information obtained to appear in the Land Register of Scotland; the removal of sporting rights exemption from rates, which are to be re-valued; and further powers for Scottish Natural Heritage to control deer management. It also makes provision for notice and consultation where core paths are to be amended.

Avnillah saw action during the Russo-Turkish War in 1877‚Äì1878, where she supported Ottoman forces in the Caucasus. After the war, she was placed in reserve and allowed to deteriorate; by the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, she was in unserviceable condition. Avnillah was modernized in 1903-1906 during a major reconstruction program begun after the war. She became a harbor defense ship stationed in Beirut. She was sunk by the Italian armored cruiser in the Battle of Beirut during the Italo-Turkish War in February 1912. Design Line-drawing of Avnillah Avnillah was long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . The hull was constructed with iron, incorporated a partial double bottom, and displaced normally and BOM. She had a crew of 15 officers and 130 enlisted men. The ship was powered by a single horizontal compound engine which drove one screw propeller. Steam was provided by four coal-fired box boilers that were trunked into a single funnel amidships. The engine was rated at and produced a top speed of , though by 1877 she was only capable of . Decades of poor maintenance had reduced the ship's speed to by 1892. Avnillah carried of coal. A supplementary brigantine rig was also fitted. The ship was armed with a battery of four muzzle loading guns mounted in a central, armored casemate, two guns per side. The guns were positioned so as to allow any two to fire directly ahead, astern, or to either broadside. The ship's armored belt was thick, with the thicker portion above the waterline and the thinner below. The belt was capped with thick transverse bulkheads at either end. The casemate had heavy armor protection, with the gun battery protected by 150 mm of iron plating. Service history Avnillah was ordered in 1867 and was laid down at the Thames Iron Works in Blackwall, London the following year. She was launched on 21 April 1869; fitting-out work was completed by 1870, when she conducted sea trials before being commissioned later that year. Upon completion, Avnillah and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in the aftermath of the Cretan Revolt of 1866-1869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals. Avnillah was assigned to the II Squadron of the Asiatic Fleet, along with her sister ship and the ironclads and . Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. =Russo-Turkish War= The Ottoman ironclad fleet in the Golden Horn; Avnillah is among the vessels present The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to begin preparations for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. In December 1876, Avnillah and her sister ship were transferred to Batumi owing to the increasingly active Russian naval forces in the area. The Russo-Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war. Avnillah spent the war in the Black Sea squadron, with the bulk of the Ottoman ironclad fleet. The eight ironclads of the Ottoman fleet in the Black Sea, commanded by Hobart, were vastly superior to the Russian Black Sea Fleet; the only ironclads the Russians possessed there were and , circular vessels that had proved to be useless in service, owing to their very low speed and the difficulty in controlling them. The presence of the fleet did force the Russians to keep two corps in reserve for coastal defense, but the Ottoman high command failed to make use of its naval superiority in a more meaningful way, particularly to hinder the Russian advance into the Balkans. Hobart Pasha took the fleet to the eastern Black Sea, where he was able to make a more aggressive use of it to support the Ottoman forces battling the Russians in the Caucasus. The fleet bombarded Poti and assisted in the defense of Batumi. On 14 May 1877, an Ottoman squadron consisting of Avnillah, Muin-i Zafer, , , , and bombarded Russian positions around the Black Sea port of Sokhumi before landing infantry and arming the local populace to start an uprising against the Russians. The Ottomans captured Sokhumi two days later. Over the course of the war, Russian torpedo boats made several attacks on the vessels stationed in Batumi, but Avnillah was not damaged in any of them. The fleet continued to support the Ottoman garrison at Batumi, when held out against constant Russian attacks to the end of the war. =Later career= Avnillah sunk in Beirut harbor, seen from the air during World War I The ship was laid up in Constantinople in 1878; she did not see further activity for the next twenty years. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. During this period, the ship underwent a slight modernization. In 1882, a pair of breech-loading guns manufactured by Krupp were added. At some point, she also received new Scotch marine boilers, and her brigantine rig was removed, with heavy military masts installed in its place. The Ottomans planned to further strengthen the ship's armament with a pair of Krupp guns, two Hotchkiss revolver cannon, two guns, also manufactured by Hotchkiss, and a torpedo tube, but the plan came to nothing. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Avnillah was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, the Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Avnillah, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy, which possessed the three modern s. The ships' guns and armor were long obsolete, and their crews were poorly trained. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, particularly the British Admiral Henry Wood and the German Admiral Eugen Kalau vom Hofe, who led the inspection. The fleet proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed the ships, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work. By 1900, the contracts were finally awarded, but Avnillah was not included in the program. After further negotiations, Gio. Ansaldo & C. received the contract to rebuild the ship in 1903, with work lasting until 1906. Her old muzzle-loading guns were replaced with new Krupp 40-caliber guns, and a new light battery consisting of six quick-firing (QF) Krupp guns, ten QF Krupp guns, and two QF Krupp guns. Long since obsolete, Avnillah was reduced to a stationary ship based in Beirut in 1910, where she was tasked with providing local defense. By this time, she was armed with only four quick-firing guns. In September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, initiating the Italo-Turkish War. The Italian command was concerned that Avnillah or the torpedo boat , which was also in the harbor, would attack Italian troop transports passing through the Suez Canal, and therefore decided to neutralize the vessels. On the morning of 24 February 1912, two Italian armored cruisers, and arrived off the port and demanded that the two ships be surrendered. At 09:00, having heard no reply from the Ottoman Vali (Governor), the Italian vessels opened fire at a range of . In the ensuing Battle of Beirut, the Italians hit Avnillah and set her on fire; she returned fire against the Italian cruisers but scored no hits. The cruisers then entered the harbor, where Giuseppe Garibaldi fired two torpedoes at Avnillah, the first of which missed and sank six civilian vessels. The second struck her amidships and sank her in the shallow water. Casualty estimates range from two officers and forty-nine enlisted men killed to three officers and fifty-five men killed in the sinking. A further eight officers and a hundred men were injured.

Muin-i Zafer saw action during the Russo-Turkish War in 1877-1878, where she supported Ottoman forces in the Caucasus. After the war, she was placed in reserve and allowed to deteriorate; by the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, she was in unserviceable condition. Muin-i Zafer was reconstruction by Gio. Ansaldo & C. after the war, and was later converted for secondary duties, including as a training ship in 1913, a barracks ship in 1920, and a depot ship for submarines in 1928.

The hull was constructed with iron, incorporated a partial double bottom, and displaced normally and BOM. She had a crew of 15 officers and 130 enlisted men.

A supplementary brigantine rig was also fitted. The ship was armed with a battery of four muzzle loading guns mounted in a central, armored casemate, two guns per side. The guns were positioned so as to allow any two to fire directly ahead, astern, or to either broadside. The ship's armored belt was thick, with the thicker portion above the waterline and the thinner below. The belt extended 0.6 m (2 ft) above the line and 1.2 m (4 ft) below, and was capped with thick transverse bulkhead at either end. The casemate had heavy armor protection, with the gun battery protected by 152 mm of iron plating. Service history Muin-i Zafer, meaning \\"Aid to Triumph\\", was ordered in 1867 from the Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town, London. The keel for the ship was laid down in 1868 and she was launched in June 1869. She conducted sea trials in 1870 and was commissioned into the Ottoman fleet later that year. Upon completion, Muin-i Zafer and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in stabilizing the island in the aftermath of the Cretan Revolt of 1866-1869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals. Muin-i Zafer was assigned to the II Squadron of the Asiatic Fleet, along with her sister ship and the ironclads and . Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. =Russo-Turkish War= The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to prepare for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. In December 1876, Muin-i Zafer and her sister ship were transferred to Batumi owing to the increasingly active Russian naval forces in the area.

About long, it drains an area of the high Sierra Nevada about northeast of Fresno. Course The South Fork begins at Martha Lake, above sea level, near Mount Goddard in the northern section of Kings Canyon National Park in Fresno County. It flows northwest through the narrow Goddard Canyon, receiving Evolution Creek from the east, then leaves the park at the confluence with Piute Creek from the north, entering the Sierra National Forest. It then flows west, through Blayney Meadows, into Florence Lake, impounded by Florence Lake Dam. Below the dam it flows briefly north, receiving Bear Creek, before turning west again, through a wider valley past Mono Hot Springs then receiving its main tributary, Mono Creek, from the north. The South Fork enters the Ansel Adams Wilderness as it turns northwest, receiving Four Forks and Rube Creeks before crossing into Madera County. Soon after entering Madera County, it joins the San Joaquin River, in a deep granite canyon below Balloon Dome at San Joaquin river mile 334 (km 537), a short distance above Mammoth Pool Reservoir. River modifications The Florence Lake Dam, as well as Vermillion Valley Dam on Mono Creek which forms Lake Thomas A. Edison, are both part of the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project operated by Southern California Edison to provide electricity to Los Angeles. In 1925, water was first diverted from the South Fork via the Ward Tunnel into Huntington Lake. The concrete multiple-arch Florence Lake dam was completed in 1926 to ensure a year-round water supply for the tunnel. The larger, earthen Vermillion Valley Dam was built much later, in 1953. The dams divert a considerable amount of water from the South Fork for power generation, especially during the late summer and fall when water flows are already naturally low. Recreation The South Fork between Piute Creek and Florence Lake has a wide variety of difficulty levels for boating, ranging from a gentle, smooth meandering stream in the Blayney Meadows section to continuous Class VI to V+ whitewater in the last above Florence Lake, as well as a number of waterfalls that must be portaged. Below the Florence Lake Dam river flows are less reliable due to water diversions, except in years of particularly heavy snowmelt.

She showed considerable promise as a two-year-old in 2002, winning a maiden race and being placed in the Debutante Stakes and the Rockfel Stakes before taking the Eyrefield Stakes. In the following spring she won the Irish 1000 Guineas and appeared an unlucky loser when narrowly beaten in The Oaks. She failed to win again but finished placed in the Prix Vermeille, Prix de l'Op√©ra and the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf. Background Yesterday is a bay mare with a broad white blaze and four white socks bred in Ireland by Premier Bloodstock, a breeding company owned by John Magnier of the Coolmore Stud and Richard Henry. During her racing career she was owned by Susan Magnier and Richard Henry's wife Roisin and was trained at Ballydoyle by Aidan O'Brien. She was ridden in most of her races by Mick Kinane. She was from the fifteenth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Yesterday's dam Jude showed little ability as a racehorse, failing to win in four starts before being sold to Premier Bloodstock for 92,000 guineas as a three-year-old. She made more impact as a broodmare, with her other foals including Quarter Moon (second in The Oaks) and All My Loving (third in the Epsom Oaks). Several of Jude's foals were named in reference to Beatles songs: apart from Yesterday (\\"Yesterday\\") and All My Loving (\\"All My Loving\\") they included Magicalmysterytour (\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\") and Betterbetterbetter (from the lyric of \\"Hey Jude\\"). Jude's dam Alruccaba was an influential broodmare whose other descendants have included Alborada, Allegretto (Prix Royal Oak), Aussie Rules (Poule d'Essai des Poulains) and Albanova (Preis von Europa). Racing career =2002: two- year-old season= Yesterday began her racing career in the Listed Fillies' Sprint Stakes at Naas Racecourse on 3 June in which she finished eighth of the eleven runners behind the British challenger Rag Top. Later that month she started 1/2 favourite for a seven furlong maiden race at Tipperary Racecourse an won \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from Encircle. The filly was then stepped up in class and started 5/4 favourite for the Group Three Debutante Stakes at the Curragh in August but was beaten into second by the 14/1 outsider Rainbows For All. After a break of almost two month Yesterday was sent to France for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 6 October. After turning into the straight in third place she was outpaced in the closing stages and finished sixth of the ten runners behind Six Perfections. Less than two weeks later she appeared at Newmarket Racecourse in England to contest the Rockfel Stakes and finished third behind Luvah Girl and Casual Look. On her final appearance of the year Yesterday was matched against male opposition in the Listed Eyrefield Stakes over nine furlongs on heavy ground at Leopardstown Racecourse on 10 November. Starting the 6/4 favourite in an eighteen-runner field she took the lead a furlong from the finish and accelerated away from her rivals to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths. Her win meant that Kinane clinched his 12th Irish Champion Jockey title. =2003: three-year-old season= Yesterday began her second season in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 4 May in which she started a 20/1 outsider and finished eighth of the nineteen runners as Russian Rhythm won from Six Perfections, Intercontinental and Soviet Song. Three weeks later at the Curragh Yesterday was one of eight fillies to contest the Irish 1000 Guineas and started the 11/2 second choice in the betting behind Six Perfections who was made the odds-on favourite. The other runners included Walayef (Round Tower Stakes, Athasi Stakes), Dimitrova (Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes), Luminata (Silver Flash Stakes) and Cat Belling (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). Yesterday raced in fourth place as L'Ancresse set the pace before Dimitrova went to the front two furlongs from the finish. She overtook Dimitrova inside the final furlong and held off the late challenge of Six Perfections to win by a short head. The runner-up appeared somewhat unfortunate as her jockey Johnny Murtagh was unable to obtain a clear run until the final strides. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"Mick's ride was perfection. Yesterday stops when she hits the front but he couldn't wait any longer than he did. She goes on fast ground but she does like an ease. She will go for the Oaks\\". Kinane said, \\"Some days the luck bounces for you and some days it doesn't. Johnny found himself in one of those positions today. But in fairness to Yesterday, she did everything right\\". On 6 June Yesterday was moved up in distance and started 100/30 favourite for the 225th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. After being restrained in the early stages she attempted to move into contention in the straight but was repeatedly blocked and hampered before obtaining a clear run inside the final furlong. She finished strongly but failed by a neck to peg back Casual Look, appearing to be an unlucky loser. The Irish Times's correspondent stated that she was \\"clearly the best filly in the race\\". In the Irish Oaks at the Curragh on 13 July she started the 11/8 favourite but finished fourth behind Vintage Tipple, L'Ancresse and Casual Look. After a late summer break Yesterday was sent to France for the Group One Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp on 14 September. Ridden by Jamie Spencer she turned into the straight in fifth place and stayed on well but failed by a head to overhaul the Godolphin filly Mezzo Soprano. The filly was matched against older fillies and mares when she returned to Longchamp for the Prix de l'Op√©ra over 2000 metres on 5 October. She was held up at the back of the field before making a strong late run and finished second, beaten a head by the British-trained four-year-old Zee Zee Top with Bright Sky (winner of the race in 2002) a neck away in third. Yesterday was then sent to America for the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf at Santa Anita Park on 25 October in which she stayed on from the rear of the field to finish third behind Islington and L'Ancresse. =2004: four-year-old season= Yesterday remained in training as a four-year-old and was ridden by Spencer in all three of her starts. After an absence of more than ten months she returned in the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown on 11 September and finished fifth of the six runners behind Soviet Song. She then ran for the second time in the Prix de l'Op√©ra and finished fourth behind Alexander Goldrun. She ended her racing career with a second attempt at the Breeders Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Lone Star Park on 30 October and finished fifth behind Ouija Board in a twelve-runner field.

Naomi Siegler Savage (June 25, 1927 ‚Äì November 22, 2005) was an American photographer. Early life and education Born Naomi Siegler, she was a native of Princeton, New Jersey. Her parents were Samuel Siegler and Elsie Siegler (n√©e Radnitzky), a sister of Man Ray. She first studied photography under Berenice Abbott at the New School for Social Research in 1943, following this with studies in art, photography, and music at Bennington College from 1944 until 1947. The next year she spent in California with her uncle, studying his techniques. In 1950 she married the architect and sculptor David Savage, with whom she moved to Paris, living there for some years. Career During her career Savage received an award from the Cassandra Foundation in 1970, and a photography fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1971. In 1976 she received the silver award from the Art Directors Club. Later in life, Savage returned to live in Princeton, where she died. Savage was heavily influence by her uncle, Man Ray, prompting her to experiment with the medium of photography, combining traditional techniques with more unusual processes, including some of her own design. She worked extensively with photogravure and photoengraving, transforming these mechanical printing techniques to be used for aesthetic effects rather than duplication. Unlike many photographers, Savage considered the metal plate that photographs are etched on to be a work of art in its own right. She pioneered the use of using the photographic metal plate to produce a three dimensional form with a metallic surface. Savage explored variations in color and texture in her work often by using inked and intaglio relief prints. Many of her works were created by combining media such as collage, negative images, texture screening, multiple exposure, photograms, solarization, toning, printing on metallic foils. Her works focus on a variety of subject matter and imagery, which has included portraits, landscapes, human figures, mannequins, masks, toys, kitchen utensils, dental and ophthalmological equipment. Legacy Several of her pieces are owned by the Museum of Modern Art, and she is represented as well in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the International Center for Photography, the Fogg Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the Madison Art Center. A photoengraved mural depicting the life of Lyndon Baines Johnson is a centerpiece of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum. A collection of her papers relating to the life of Man Ray is held by the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution.

One of the passages concerns the first documented palaeontological studies, which he performed on the banks of the Vistula. The fossils of prehistoric animals that were discovered then, were sent to Dresden, where they formed the core of one of the collections displayed in the Zwinger Palace. He also described his experiences in Warsaw in the accompaniment of August the Strong. In 1733 Erndel published De plantis circa thermos Teplicenes crescentibus, in the third volume of the Processes of the Academy of the Curiosity of Nature, a catalogue of plants growing in the vicinity of Teplice in Bohemia.  First Meteorologist in Warsaw  Warsaw Meteorological Data, January 1725 Erndel was also the first to introduce systematic weather observations in Warsaw. The daily measurements listed by him for air pressure, temperature, wind and clouds during the four-year period from 1725 to 1728, were the first statistics of this nature in the history of the city.http://www.sb-verlag.de/programm/070/PDFs/Warschau-104-107.pdf  Demise  Erndel left Warsaw in 1730, returning to his place of birth, Dresden.

Thompson (born 1985) is a former American journalist who was later convicted for cyberstalking and making several bomb threats to Jewish Community Centers in the U.S. Personal background Thompson is a native of St. Louis, Missouri. He attended Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, and was connected to the student newspaper. However, Thompson failed to graduate. He was a summer intern with DNAinfo Chicago and an intern for a WBEZ talk show for four months. In November 2016, Thompson announced plans to run for mayor of St. Louis, but failed to raise money in an online campaign, only raising $25 from a single donation. Reporting scandal and termination from The Intercept Thompson was a staff reporter for The Intercept, but was fired in February 2016 for fabricating quotes and attributions in news articles. This included a false claim, purportedly made by a cousin of Dylann Roof, that Roof was motivated to commit the Charleston church shooting because a former love interest chose black men over Roof. A note from editor Betsy Reed indicated that Thompson had been fired recently after his editors discovered \\"a pattern of deception\\" in his reporting. According to Reed, he had \\"fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people, one of which was a Gmail account in my name\\". The site's investigation into Thompson's reporting had found that he had, on multiple occasions, attributed quotes to people who said he had not interviewed them or did not remember him doing so, people whom they could not reach to verify the quote or whose identity could not be confirmed. In the retracted story, Roof's family said they did not know of a cousin whom Thompson had quoted as saying Roof's interest in white supremacy took off after a woman to whom he was attracted began dating a black man. He also used \\"quotes that we cannot verify from unnamed people whom he claimed to have encountered at public events\\". To prevent his fabrications from being discovered, she continued, he lied to editors about how he had gotten the quotes, and in one case created an email account in the name of one of his sources. When editors discovered his actions, she added, he stood by his published work and, while admitting to creating the email accounts, refused to assist in the review otherwise. In an email to Reed he shared with various news outlets, Thompson said he was being treated for testicular cancer and for that reason had not had access to his notes when the site had asked to review them. He explained his methods as \\"writing drafts of stories, placing the names of [people] I wanted to get quotes from in there, and then going to fetch the quotes ... If I couldn't obtain a quote from the person I wanted, I went somewhere else, and must've forgot to change the names‚Äîclearly.\\" While he admitted this was \\"sloppy\\", he faulted The Intercept for lacking \\"a sustained and competent editor to guide me,\\" alluding to the site's managerial turnovers. He also claimed that the greater problem was racism in the media field, that he made up pseudonyms for some of his sources because they were \\"poor black people who didn't want their names in the public given the situations\\" and who would not have spoken with a reporter otherwise, and that he had felt a need to \\"exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth\\" at The Intercept given incidents of racial bias he said he had witnessed there. When Gawker published his email, Reed said those allegations had not been in the version he sent her. After the note was published, the site amended Thompson's online biography when an editor at a Chicago public radio station said that while Thompson had indeed worked there, he had no involvement in the station's news reporting as he had claimed. His past tenure at DNAinfo in Chicago, where one editor tweeted in response to the story that she could have seen it coming, was also edited out. He was fired by The Intercept in early 2016, and according to Reed, did not cooperate into the investigation of his actions. Post-termination Following his termination from The Intercept, a reporter from The Riverfront Times documented Thompson's history of ethical breaches in his job. This reportedly prompted Thompson to harass the reporter. He first attempted to get him fired, then set up a series of fake social media accounts in which he claimed the reporter was a rapist. The accounts were later shut down by investigators. On July 7, 2016, Thompson posted a 5,000-word essay in which he ranted against what he claimed to be \\"[t]he white New York media\\" and claimed The Intercept had launched a racist smear campaign against him. In 2017, he had been working as communications director for the Gateway Housing Foundation a small, St. Louis-based, non-profit organization dedicated to helping the homeless. The Gateway Housing Foundation released a statement that Thompson had only worked there a short time and was released prior to his making bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers, an event which it condemned, noting that its founder had studied Hebrew. =Cyberstalking and bomb threats= In 2016, after Thompson's girlfriend broke up with him, he began harassing her and making bomb threats to Jewish Community Centers to get revenge. According to officials, Thompson phoned in and emailed many of the threats under his ex- girlfriend's name in an effort to frame her. Thompson also made at least one threat under his own name, under the pretense that his ex-girlfriend was framing him. He had also emailed the Anti-Defamation League in his own name in late February 2017, pointing to his ex-girlfriend as the perpetrator of all of the bomb threats. Thompson was arrested in March 2017 by the FBI in St. Louis for allegedly making bomb threats against at least eight Jewish community centers. He was also charged with one count of cyberstalking. He was extradited to New York and appeared in Manhattan federal court on March 29, where his public defender declined to seek bail. On April 10, Thompson pleaded not guilty to the charge of cyberstalking. He was scheduled to reappear in court on May 18. On June 13, Thompson pleaded guilty to one count of cyberstalking and one count of sending bomb threats to Jewish community centers. In December 2017, he was sentenced to five years in prison.

It has been suggested, as a possible etymological explanation, that the word was created as a combination of the two (exactly opposite) words kharab (\\"ruinous\\") and abad (\\"prosperous\\", also a suffix forming city names). In the words of Prof. Hamid Dabashi; \\"Persian literary historians have concurred that the word originally meant \\"house or tavern of ill repute\\" but was eventually appropriated by mystics to mean a place that they frequent by way of suspending all hypocritical pretense to piety (...) The idea is that there are places that you can frequent that will dismantle your beliefs, and yet, in doing so, will also restore your faith. The proverbial tavern in Persian poetry is that kharabat.\\" Nonetheless, since vowels are often omitted in Persian, the word could also be read as Khor-abat or, meaning the site of Khor. The word Khor refers to the Sun. The modern term for the Sun in Persian in Khor-shid, meaning \\"Sun shine.\\" This would link Persian poetry also to the ancient mystery cult of Mithraism, in which wine played a liturgical role.

Forming as a moderate tropical storm on 3 March, Enawo initially drifted and intensified slowly. It strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 5 March and further an intense tropical cyclone on 6 March. Enawo made landfall over Sava Region on 7 March just after reaching peak intensity, and it emerged back into the Indian Ocean as a post-tropical depression late on 9 March, before dissipating two days later. Fifteen municipalities (out of 31) were severely affected, in the two most impacted districts of Antalaha and Maroantsetra. Meteorological history A monsoon trough started to persist west of Diego Garcia in late February 2017 as the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation (MJO) over the Indian Ocean grew more noticeable. On 2 March, a zone of disturbed weather formed within the area, although it was initially difficult to define a clear centre; later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the improving low-level structure and favourable environmental conditions. Only six hours after the system about north of Mauritius intensifying to a tropical disturbance, M√©t√©o- France upgraded it to a moderate tropical storm at 06:00 UTC on 3 March with the name Enawo from the Mauritius Meteorological Services, because of the recent ASCAT-B data suggesting gale-force winds. The JTWC also began to issue tropical cyclone warnings on Enawo. Since the afternoon, Enawo started to significantly slow down with the weakening of the tropical ridge that drove the track southwards. Due to easterly vertical wind shear, the centre was located in the eastern part of deep convection. Enawo developed into a severe tropical storm at around 18:00 UTC on 4 March, displaying an impressive embedded centre pattern associated with extremely cold cloud tops. The JTWC indicated a system equivalent to Category 1 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale at the same time. M√©t√©o-France upgraded Enawo to a tropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC on 5 March, after it resumed a west to west-southwest track steered by the mid- troposphere ridge south of Madagascar. Enawo formed a ragged eye soon afterward, thanks to favourable conditions of excellent outflow, weaker vertical wind shear, and warm sea surface temperatures; however, the strengthening phase was halted for a half of day owing to a possible eyewall replacement cycle. Enawo started to intensify again and developed a well- defined eye indicated by both of satellite and microwave imageries, prompting M√©t√©o-France upgrading the system to an intense tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC based on the structural improvements. The JTWC reported that Enawo had become a Category 4-equivalent cyclone at 18:00 UTC, with one-minute maximum sustained winds at . Early on 7 March, cloud tops cooled again around the eye, despite the fluctuating eye definition. Enawo reached its peak intensity at 06:00 UTC on 7 March, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at and the central pressure at 932 hPa (27.32 inHg). Soon after that, Enawo made landfall over the area between Antalaha and Sambava in Sava Region, Madagascar at around 09:30 UTC (12:30 EAT), becoming the strongest landfall to the country since Gafilo in 2004. The cyclone started to rapidly weaken due to land interaction with a cloud-filled eye and the warming cloud tops; the JTWC also issued a final warning later for the inland movement. After classified as an overland depression early on 8 March and moving further inland, it started to accelerated southwards the next day along the weakening mid-troposphere ridge on Madagascar, with deep convection rather far away from the ill-defined centre. Meanwhile, gale-force winds still maintained over the eastern coast throughout the inland period. Enawo emerged into the Indian Ocean late on 9 March and was considered as a post-tropical depression by M√©t√©o-France because of the asymmetric and shallow core. However, the JTWC started to issue a tropical cyclone warning on Enawo again due to a warm anomaly at 10 km altitude. Despite a final warning from the JTWC again for winds below gale- force a half of day later, M√©t√©o-France indicated that Ex-Enawo strengthened again during its extratropical transition, according to data from ships. The system became fully extratropical soon afterward, before dissipating late on 11 March. Preparations and impact =Madagascar= Enawo over Madagascar on 8 March When Enawo attained intense tropical cyclone status, MFR warned of a significant storm surge of up to , declaring the storm to have become \\"very dangerous\\". Accordingly, Meteo Madagascar issued a red alert for several regions expected to be impacted by the storm. The National Bureau of Risk and Disaster Management has advised the evacuation of low-lying areas and the acquisition of supplies in advance of the storm. The Piroi regional center of the International Red Cross has prepared to intervene should the government demand it. Enawo made landfall halfway between the towns of Sambava and Antalaha as an Intense Tropical Cyclone at approximately 09:30 UTC (12:30 a.m. local time) on 7 March. In the district of Maroantsetra, landslides and strong winds caused widespread infrastructural damage, which also rendered 500 people homeless. There, a landslide killed one adult and two children, in addition to injuring six others. The city of Antalaha was particularly hard hit, where the port became inaccessible and half the population was rendered homeless. Rice fields in Antalaha and Sambava districts were submerged after heavy rain and suffered severe losses. The Lohoko River burst its banks near Farahalana, inundating part of the town. As of 17 March, 78 deaths have been reported across the country, with 18 other people reported missing.

These are nonsense papers that were accepted by an academic journal or academic conference; the list does not include cases of scientific misconduct. The intent of such publications is typically to expose shortcomings in a journal's peer review process or to criticize the standards of pay-to-publish journals. Mathematics * In 2012, the open-access journal Advances in Pure Mathematics accepted a nonsense paper produced by the computer program Mathgen. Although the paper was accepted, the \\"author\\" declined to pay the journal's $500 publishing fee. Computer science * A paper randomly generated by the SCIgen program was accepted without peer-review for presentation at the 2005 World Multiconference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics (WMSCI). The conference accepted the article as a non-peer reviewed submission, despite none of the three assigned peer-reviewers having submitted an opinion about its fidelity, veracity, or accuracy to its subject. The three MIT graduate students who wrote the hoax article said they were unaware of the Sokal Affair until after submitting their article. Subsequently, numerous other papers generated by SCIgen have been published in scientific journals or accepted for presentation at scientific conferences. * In December 2013, a Pune-based software professional submitted a bogus paper titled \\"use of cloud-computing and social media to determine box office performance\\", which was accepted by the Bhubaneswar-based Research Forum for their ICRIEST-AICEEMCS International Conference. The paper's introductory section itself cautioned that it contained some \\"gibberish\\" that was auto- generated by software. One section of the paper also includes 19 lines about the 1970s Bollywood film Sholay, and 19 lines from My Cousin Vinny, a 1992 Hollywood film. The incident highlighted a practice where \\"poor quality papers are accepted from students who are then asked to pay a few thousand rupees to participate in the conferences\\". After that the management of the event retracted the paper and apologized publicly. The Secretary in an interview described the acceptance as a human error of the coordinators. * In 2014, Australian computer scientist Dr Peter Vamplew submitted a paper to the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology (IJACT) after being angered that the journal would not take his email off its mailing list. The article, titled \\"Get me off your fucking mailing list\\", consisted of the phrase \\"Get me off your fucking mailing list\\" being repeated for the entirety of the article body. The journal requested the researcher to \\"add some more recent references and do a bit of reformatting\\" saying that the article's \\"suitability for the journal was excellent\\". Philosophy On April 1st 2015, philosophers Philippe Huneman and Anouk Barberousse published a hoax article entitled ‚ÄúOntology, Neutrality and the Strive for (non-)Being-Queer\\" in the journal Badiou Studies.https://www.liberation.fr/debats/2016/05/31/canulars- academiques-les-maitres-a-penser- demasques_1456452https://retractionwatch.com/2016/04/07/philosophy-journal- spoofed-retracts-hoax-article/ The paper was submitted under the pen name Benedetta Tripodi and was subsequently retracted. The parody was designed to undermine the foundation of Alain Badiou's thought. The authors have explained their motives this way:https://retractionwatch.com/2016/04/07/philosophy- journal-spoofed-retracts-hoax-article/ The hoax was exposed in the French newspaper Lib√©ration with the support of Alan Sokal, among others. Answering critics who denounced their strategy as one of avoidance rather than criticism, they pointed to Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal to show that publishing hoaxes is sometimes a good way to voice criticism.https://www.liberation.fr/debats/2016/05/31/canulars-academiques- les-maitres-a-penser-demasques_1456452 Physics * Christoph Bartneck, an Associate Professor in Information Technology at New Zealand's University of Canterbury, was invited to submit a paper to the 2016 International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics organised by ConferenceSeries. With little knowledge of nuclear physics, he used iOS's auto-complete function to write the paper, choosing randomly from its suggestions after starting each sentence, and submitted it under the name Iris Pear (a reference to Siri and Apple). A sample sentence from the abstract for the resulting manuscript was: \\"The atoms of a better universe will have the right for the same as you are the way we shall have to be a great place for a great time to enjoy the day you are a wonderful person to your great time to take the fun and take a great time and enjoy the great day you will be a wonderful time for your parents and kids\\". The 516-word abstract contained the words \\"good\\" and \\"great\\" a combined total of 28 times (and is available online). Despite making no sense, the work was accepted within three hours of submission and a conference registration fee of US$1099 requested. ConferenceSeries is associated with the OMICS Publishing Group, which produces open access journals widely regarded as predatory, and has been accused of moving into \\"predatory meetings\\". Bartneck said he was \\"reasonably certain that this is a money-making conference with little to no commitment to science,\\" given the poor quality of the review process and the high cost of attendance. Chemistry * \\"Who's Afraid of Peer Review?\\": In 2013 John Bohannon wrote in Science about a \\"sting operation\\" he conducted in which he submitted \\"a credible but mundane scientific paper, one with such grave errors that a competent peer reviewer should easily identify it as flawed and unpublishable\\", to 304 open-access publishers. 157 journals accepted the paper. There have been some objections to the sting's methodology and about what conclusions can be drawn from it. Medicine * John McLachlan, a professor of medical education, hoaxed the Jerusalem Conference on Integrative Medicine in 2010 with invented nonsense. *Dr Elaine Murphy hoaxed the British Medical Journal in 1974 with a case report on the fictional medical condition cello scrotum. * In August 2020, the graduate student Mathieu Rebeaud and the professor of philosophy Florian Cova hoaxed the predatory Asian Journal of Medicine and Health with an article titled SARS- CoV-2 was Unexpectedly Deadlier than Push-scooters: Could Hydroxychloroquine be the Unique Solution?Journal accepts fake story about scooters and hydroxychloroquineHydroxychloroquine, push-scooters, and COVID-19: A journal gets stung, and swiftly retracts. The authors list include none other than the then French president's dog, NemoFull article on researchget.net. Psychology * In 2007, Tomasz Witkowski published a fake article in the psychology journal Charaktery. James Randi and other science bloggers covered the hoax. Interdisciplinary and cultural studies * The Sokal affair: Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London, wrote a paper titled \\"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\\", which proposed that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct. The paper was published in the Social Text spring/summer 1996 \\"Science Wars\\" issue. At that time, the journal did not practice academic peer review and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.. Reply by Alan Sokal. On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in Lingua Franca that the article was a hoax. * The Soci√©t√©s hoax: Using a false identity, Manuel Quinon and Arnaud Saint-Martin submitted an intentionally inept and absurd article on the \\"Autolib'\\", a small rentable car in Paris, to Michel Maffesoli's Soci√©t√©s journal. The article was deliberately incoherent and plastered with liberal quotes and references to Maffesoli and other postmodern thinkers. The article was duly \\"reviewed\\" by two people, before being accepted and published in Soci√©t√©s without any substantial editing. * In May 2017, Peter Boghossian and James Lindsay published an absurd paper in the open access journal Cogent Social Sciences which argued that the penis is best understood not as a biological organ but rather as a social construct. The paper came to an absurd conclusion that the conceptual penis is a \\"driver behind much of climate change\\". The authors' goal was to expose bias towards extreme ideologies in social science and gender studies. Critics of the sting operation argue that it did not demonstrate the existence of such biases, despite the authors' goals of doing so. Phil Torres of Salon, for example, argued that the sting shows only that academic journals that require authors to pay for papers to be published have a financial inclination \\"to accept papers regardless of quality.\\" He also noted that none of the editorial board members of Cogent Social Sciences have expertise in gender studies. James E. McWilliams criticized the authors' motives, writing that \\"Boghossian and Lindsay are white men working in the most male-dominated academic fields (philosophy and math) attempting to humiliate through bullying one of the few academic fields dominated by women. In our current political climate‚Äîthriving as it does on shamelessness and humiliation‚Äîthis scenario, as the motives become increasingly transparent, only calls for kind of scrutiny and understanding that gender studies can provide.\\" *The \\"Grievance Studies\\" affair (also referred to as the \\"Sokal Squared\\" Hoax by the news media): Over 2017-2018 Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay and Peter Boghossian wrote 20 hoax articles; at the time the hoax stopped, four papers had been published, three had been accepted but not yet published, seven were under review, and six had been rejected. The papers all focused on what the authors called \\"grievance studies\\" related to race, gender, sexuality and other forms of identity. The hoax was revealed and halted after one of the papers in the feminist geography journal Gender, Place and Culture was criticized on social media, and then on Campus Reform, which led a Wall Street Journal editorial writer to investigate and report on it. The paper, which was in the process of being retracted when the Wall Street Journal story broke, referred to dog parks as \\"petri dishes for canine rape culture\\". The report also described a paper published in Affilia which contained a reworded excerpt from Mein Kampf.

History According to the records of United States missionaries in Shandong, Pastor Gary of the Presbyterian Church and Jesse Boardman Hartwell of the Southern Baptist Convention arrived in Laizhou in 1862. In a county fair they came across Zhong Ning, who was from the quarrying village of Ning located about four kilometres to the west of Laizhou, and preached to him: he was immediately converted to Christianity. Afterwards he went back to his village and founded a church. This is the earliest written record of the spread of Christianity in Laizhou. Later, due to the American Civil War, the Southern Baptist Convention hit economic difficulties, Pastor Hartwell left Shandong to work in Shanghai as a translator for a living, and the Presbyterian Church settled down in Ning from then on. In 1865, Mateer and Hunter Corbett arrived in the state of Laizhou for missionary work and stayed there for a week.Daniel W. Fisher (nd): \\"Calvin Wilson Mateer, Forty-Five Years a Missionary in Shantung,China, A Biography\\" In the late Qing Dynasty, 26th Guangxu (1900 Year), the American pastor John W Lowe bought a piece of land in Xiyingfang Village, where he built a four-story church. The top floor was used as a bell tower, commonly known as the awning floor (the address is now that of the Laizhou construction company). Inside, a church was set up, described as \\"Baptist\\". At the same time, to the south of the east road of the town's main crossroad, the Gospel Church was founded, where missionary work and preaching was held on Sundays. Later, the American pastor Lan Martin took it over. Lan Martin lived a long time (14 years) in Laizhou, developing believers, establishing schools, hospitals and orphanages. In 1926, Martin was succeeded by Johnson, and Johnson later by KeliPei (in Chinese Pinyin; the original English-language name is unidentifiable); both were Americans. The last priests were Lutheran (US) and Fanwu Wang (China). In 1942, the church was occupied by the Japanese invaders. From 1906, at the current location of Laizhou Hospital, the construction of Meitie Hospital started, and was completed in 1908. It was reported that in the beginning, the construction was led by two Americans surnamed Meerfeld and Tieze, after whom the hospital was named. The hospital was divided into Meitie Male department and Ailin Female department, which was named after Katherine Melaury from the Southern Baptist Church. Both departments were equipped with beds. On the eve of the Japanese invasion and war, the Americans were transferred away, and thereafter the church was presided over by the doctor Lu Xianzhai (from Huang County) and his wife. It was destroyed at the end of the war. Nowadays, the Laizhou County branch of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches Committee in China rents the church located to the north of East Gate Street as a venue. This was originally built by the German Catholic priest Kaisiduo (possibly an early Chinese translation of Christoph) in 1902 or so (allegedly purchased as a private residence).

The route was opened on 1 January 2017, making London the 15th European city to have a railway route connection with China, and takes 18 days to complete\\"Silk Road freight train from China arrives in Barking\\", BBC, 18 January 2017 (other European cities with China-Europe railway routes include Hamburg, Madrid, Rotterdam, Warsaw, etc.). From Yiwu, a trading center 300 km south of Shanghai, the track passes through 9 countries: China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Belgium, France, UK. In order to get to the UK the route passes through the Channel Tunnel between France and the UK. The London end of the line is located at the DB Eurohub in Barking, East London. Break- of-gauge Two breaks of gauge exist: first from standard gauge in China to Russian gauge in Kazakhstan, and second back to standard gauge when crossing from Belarus to Poland. Because of the difference in gauges trains go through Bogie exchange or have containers reloaded to railcars of the correct gauge.Shepard, Wade (2016-01-28), \\"Why The China-Europe 'Silk Road' Rail Network Is Growing Fast\\", Forbes Travel time Despite the need to go through Bogie exchange, the trip takes only 18 days to complete. In comparison, it takes a large cargo vessel about 30‚Äì45 days of sailing to get from East Asia to Northern Europe. Trains are run by different companies. To start with, trains depart for London once a week transporting household items, garments, bags and suitcases. The media has perceived the route as a publicity stunt, as household items and clothing do not require the expedited shipping. The Yiwu ‚Äì London railway project is part of China's paramount leader Xi Jinping‚Äôs \\"One Belt, One Road\\" policy, which attempts to strengthen the country‚Äôs trade connections and revive the Silk Road of the past.  Politics  Poland's President Andrzej Duda and China's leader Xi Jinping wave to the crowd during the inauguration of the railway line in Warsaw, Poland, 20 June 2016 While the physical manifestation of and the need for the Silk Road may have eroded over the years due to the collapse of the Safavid Empire and advances in technology, Chinese leader Xi Jinping‚Äôs \\"One Belt, One Road\\" policy has breathed new life into trade of goods by land. The initiative calls for integration of the countries that make up the ancient Silk Road into a robust economic area. The integration will take place through building infrastructure for broadening trade, and increasing cultural exchanges. One Belt, One Road calls for three distinct routes to be established: north, central and south. The north route goes through Central Asia, Russia and then Europe. The central route goes through Central Asia, West Asia, Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean. The south route goes through Southeast Asia and to the Indian Ocean. The Yiwu-London train is part of the north route. While the Eurasian Land Bridge was completed in 1990, when the railway systems of China and Kazakhstan connected at Alataw Pass, it was first in October 2008 that the first Trans-Eurasia Logistics train reached Hamburg from Xiangtan officially traveling along the entire north route. However, it is only since July 2011 that the railway line has been used for regular transport when a freight route was established between Chongqing, China, and Duisburg, Germany (the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe Railway). Since then several other European cities have established railway freight connections with China on the network. London is the latest European city to establish such a freight route when the Yiwu- London route opened in January 2017. It is expected that the importance of the railway trade routes will increase with time, as anticipated cumulative investment over an indefinite timescale for the One Belt, One Road policy is estimated to be between 4 and 8 trillion US dollars.\\"Getting lost in One Belt, One Road\\", ejinsight, 12 April 2016\\"Our bulldozers, our rules\\", The Economist, 2 July 2016 The Yiwu‚ÄìLondon railway line opened just as Britain was looking outside of Europe to expand its trade, as it is unclear how Brexit will affect UK trade with Europe. British Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 in March 2017, officially starting the Brexit negotiations. It is unknown whether the Yiwu‚ÄìLondon railway line will lead to increased trade between China and the UK. Both governments hope that it will help strengthen trade between the two countries, but the service was only scheduled to run once a week for a few months in order to assess demand. If successful, the rail link could be made permanent.\\"First direct train service from China to the UK arrives in London\\", Independent, 18 January 2017 The China-Madrid railway line has experienced success by transporting olive oil back to China and it is expected that in order to become as successful, the China-London line will need to establish a similar export flow.

It held a landowner also owned the strata and minerals, unless they conveyed it, in common law or statute, to someone else, so an oil company making wells below the surface was trespass, and had to pay compulsory purchase compensation under the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966 s 8(2). Facts Bocardo claimed Star Energy (now owned by IGas Energy) committed trespass, and that a licence under the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934 was no defence. Star Energy had a licence to search for, bore and get petroleum under the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934 section 2 at Palmers Wood Oil Field, at Godstone in Surrey. It got the licence in 1999, though it was originally issued by the Secretary of State for Energy in 1980 to Conoco. Its predecessors drilled three diagonal wells, with pipelines going between below land Bocardo owned. Star Energy had never sought Bocardo's permission. Judgment =High Court= Peter Smith J held that Bocardo's title extended to the substrata beneath the land's surface, and though the pipelines cause not damage, nor affected enjoyment, there was a trespass. Under the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966 s 8(2) compensation would be based on ‚Äòwhat would be fair and reasonable between a willing grantor and a willing grantee‚Äô. He awarded ¬£621,180, calculated at 9% of the value of the oil extracted between July 2000 and December 2007, and continuing damages for trespass based on the same. =Court of Appeal= The Court of Appeal reduced compensation to ¬£1,000, on the basis that the trespass was actionable but technical. =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court held by a majority of three to two that the Court of Appeal had been correct. Bocardo did own the ground, and was entitled to claim for trespass by the wells. Star Energy had no defence in trespass under PPA 1934 s 10(3) (re-enacted in PA 1998 s 9(2). It was irrelevant if a landowner did not make use of the ground. But, for assessing damages, the right measure was the amount of compensation payable under the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966. This operated to prevent the powerful bargaining position of a landowner to control access to a potentially valuable oilfield. Lord Hope, giving the first and dissenting judgment, said a landowner did own the ground beneath, including minerals, unless there was a conveyance or statute, as in Mitchell [1914] 1 Ch 438. There had to be a logical limit, where pressure and temperature to the Earth's core made ownership so absurd as to be not worth arguing about, but the wells were not that deep. Lord Walker agreed on the trespass issue, but said the Court of Appeal was right on damages. Lord Brown said the right compensation was small. In his view by the PPA 1934, giving the Crown exclusive rights: Lord Collins agreed with Lord Hope on the principles and Lord Brown on quantum. Lord Clarke dissented.

Floyd left his supplies at the fort when he marched westward to fight the Battle of Calebee Creek. Fort Bainbridge was built in the style of a bastion fort with eight outcroppings. Captain Kendall Lewis, along with his Creek chief father-in law, Big Warrior, operated a tavern as a stagecoach stop about 400 yards west of Fort Bainbridge, which stayed open under the care of Lewis' widow until at least 1836. During his return tour, the Marquis de Lafayette stayed at the Lewis Tavern for his first night in Alabama. The site of the fort also lies along naturalist William Bartram's four-year journey through the Southern United States, during which he documented the flora, fauna and Native Americans of the area. The fort site was later used as a plantation. Today, it remains unmarked and its legacy lies in a small unincorporated community, Boromville, that developed from it. Though unmarked, the location is known and the area has been damaged by relic hunters.

They are traditional artisanal fishers primarily engaged in shallow-water fishing. In Eastern Sri Lanka are they also involved in cattle cultivation. Historically, they have also been known as Sindhu nƒÅttar (people of Sindh), following their own myth origins.  Etymology  The word Thimilar is derived from the word thimil, a Tamil word for boat, and the honorific suffix -ar, thus Thimilar is literally translated as Boatmen. The Akana·πâ≈´·πüu of the Sangam literature, mentions Thimilan, as a boat using fisherman.  History  The Vaiyapadal mentions the Sindhu Natar, a name of the Thimilar, as one of the communities inhabiting the Jaffna Peninsula. They are mentioned in the Mattakallappu Manmiyam as one of the fishing tribes living in the eastern part of Sri Lanka, who lost a battle to the Mukkuvar who were in alliance with the Pathans. Place names in the Batticaloa region are derived from the battle such as Sathurukondan (meaning \\"were enemy was killed\\", referring to the execution of the Thimilar chief) and Pathiyai-thookia-palai (where the Thimilar chieftess was hanged).

It runs from Strandvejen in the southeast to a junction just east of K√¶gersborg station in the northwest. The first leg of the road passes through Charlottenlund Forest, and it later follows the north boundary of Bernstorff Park. It passes a number of historic buildings, including Charlottenlund Palace, Bernstorff Palace and Sch√¶fferg√•rden. History J√¶gersborg All√© in the first half of the 19th century J√¶gersborg All√© after the turn of the century J√¶gersborg All√© was built on the orders of King Christian V by farmers from the parish of Gentofte. It is first mentioned in 1695, and it is believed that it was completed in the summer of 1706. The road provided a direct connection between J√¶gersborg and Gyldenlund and would also be used for royal hunts. He also constructed a pheasantry en route between the two properties. It was used for breeding pheasants for the royal hunts. Christian V died in 1699, and therefore, never saw his road finished. Gyldenlund was taken over by queen Charlotte Amalie and replaced by Charlottenlund Palace in 1730-733. J.H.E. Bernstorff received the Pheasantry from the king and constructed Bernstorff House at the site. H√¶gersborg was replaced by the Hermitage in J√¶gersborg Deer Garden and demolished in circa 1760. Bernstorffvej was constructed in 1770, linking the Royal Frederiksborg Toad with Bernstorff House and J√¶gersborg All√©. In 1829, J√¶gersborg All√© was finally opened to the public. Carriages had to pay a fee which was collected at a boom barrier in Charlottenlund. The area became more accessible with the opening of the L√¶ampenborg and Ltngby Railways in 1863. The land along the road was gradually built over. Notable buildings and residents No. 166: Sch√¶fferg√•rden Charlottenlund Palace (No 1A) is currently home to DTU Aqua. The small building at No. 2A is a former garage for a horse-drawn fire carriage. Its location next to the still existing restaurant Ved Stalden (\\"At the Stables\\") meant that horses were always present at the site in the event of fire. The building is from 1882 and was designed by Ferdinand Meldahl. No. 185-229; Alle husene Lille Bernstorff (No. 17), formerly known as Trianglen, is a house from 1811. The buildings at No. 92-94 and 90, an L-shaped main building and a stable, both from c. 1800, are also listed. J√¶gerg√•rden (No. 150), a complex of low, tallow buildings, was built in the 1750s to design by Lauritz de Thurah. It was for a while used and as stables for the king's hunting dogs and from the 1790s as army barracks. Sch√¶fferg√•rden (No. 166) is a Rococo-style mansion from 1756. It has later been expanded and is now operated as a hotel and conference centre. The house \\"Ibstrup\\" at No. 170 A has nothing to do with the much older and long gone predecessor of J√¶gersborg Castle. The L-shaped main building is from 1867 and listed. All√©husene (No. 185-229), a development of terraced housing, was built in 148-53 to design by Arne Jacobsen. Chr. Olesen & Co., a manufacturer and distributor of ingredients for the animal feed, food and pharma industries, is based at No. 164. Monuments and memorials A Femvejen, a roundabout where J√¶gersborg All√©, Bernstorffsvek, Ordrupvej and two others roads meet, is a memorial to King Christian IX and Queen Louise. The memorial was designed by the architect Andreas Vlemmesen and executed by the sculptor Anders Bundgaard. It was unveiled on 6 September 1913. Outside J√¶gersborg All√© 184 is a stone commemorating J√∏rgen Haagen Schmith, better known under the codename Citronen (Danish for the Lemon), a prominent member of the Danish resistance movement during World War II, who was killed at the site early in the morning on 15 October 1944.

Ptyctodus belongs to the family Ptyctodontidae and is of the class Placodermi. They share a close resemblance to modern day chimaeras (Holocephali). Fossils of this armour-plated fish have been found in locations such as in Russia, the Michigan Basis, and Arizona, United States.  Description and paleobiology  Ptyctodus species come in a variety of different sizes, measured data shows three specimens being 94 millimeters, 24 millimeters, 22 millimeters in length, 23 millimeters, 6 millimeters, 4 millimeter in height, and 18 millimeters, 7 millimeters, and 4 millimeters in thickness. Through time, an evolutionary morphological trait is that the species within Ptyctodontidae reduce the dermal armour. The dentition of the Ptyctodus has dental elements that are very similarly observed in chimaeroids. Its dental plates are compressed into a thin cutting edge behind the symphysis and measure 3 inches in thickness and several inches in length. The are expressed as fine punctae in parallel rows. Ptyctodus teeth are very close together in a way that they are like a fish tooth conglomerate. They were also armed with dorsal fin spines closely seen in Hetercanthus and Phlyctaenacanthus. Just like the other members of the family of Ptyctodontidae, there is a sexual dimorphism between the genders of Ptyctodus in the pelvic region where the characteristics are different; males had claspers, while females had large scale like pelvic fins along with their endoskeleton. Ptyctodus lived in a nektonic carnivore type- ecology and in carbonate, lagoonal, and shallow subtidal environments. Due to structure and shape of the teeth Ptyctodus would easily be able to crush shellfish like organisms at the bottom of the ocean floors, feeding mainly off of that. They also must seem to have been very agile swimmers, able to escape predators, like arthrodires.

She is known for her work in installations, book arts, immersive text-based installations, large-scale public text pieces, publications, collage, and audio recordings. Rasheed's art explores memory, ritual, discursive regimes, historiography, and archival practices through the use of fragments and historical residue. Based in Brooklyn, NY, she is currently the Arts Editor for SPOOK magazine and is also a contributing editor for The New Inquiry.  Background  = Early life = Born in East Palo Alto, California to Sunni Muslim parents, Rasheed characterizes herself as \\"a Muslim kid enrolled at a Catholic school and attended Mormon school dances, who went to shabbat dinners and attended Sunday church services with friends.\\" When Rasheed was twelve years old, her family was unlawfully evicted from their home due to the sharp increase of land value in northern California near East Palo Alto, and entered a period of homelessness that lasted for the next ten years. The experience of moving through temporary homes with her family led to an interest in the practice of collecting and archiving to cope with her forced displacement. Rasheed attended Pomona College for her undergraduate degree, studying public policy and Africana. She traces her interest in visual art to class on black aesthetics and the politics of representation taken in her penultimate semester at Pomona. She was awarded an Amy Biehl Fulbright Scholarship to study in South Africa. Returning to the U.S., she completed a graduate degree in secondary education from Stanford University. Early in her career, Rasheed taught social studies from the elementary school to high school level. Her background in history and pedagogy influences her artistic practice. = Visual art = Rasheed came to photography and collaging while living and studying in South Africa as an exchange student, and later as a Fulbright Scholar, where she discovered an interest in the act of documentation and interviewing. The first iteration of her immersive installation, No Instructions for Assembly, Activation I (2013), took place at Real Art Ways and consisted of over six hundred objects, including found and personal family photos, album covers, tufts of family members' hair, Islamic prayer rugs, newspaper clippings, jewelry, prayer beads, black stockings, and mirrors, among other items. Subsequent iterations of the installation have invited audiences to modify and contribute their own objects and histories to her growing archive.  Themes  The major themes of Rasheed's work revolve around conflicting histories, visual culture, being black in America, unearthing buried narratives, and the complexity of memory. Her art engages with her background in history and education, turning exhibitions into pedagogical experiences and opportunities to explore archives, our personal relationship with history, and public spaces. Rasheed's art has used distinctive signs with large, capitalized font in public spaces arranged in series or a grid. For instance, How to Suffer Politely (And Other Etiquette) is a series of billboard-size yellow posters with all-black font announcing slogans like \\"LOWER THE PITCH OF YOUR SUFFERING\\" or \\"TELL YOUR STRUGGLE WITH TRIUMPHANT HUMOR\\". The work engages with the Black Lives Matter movement, noting how people were told not to react with anger to police killing people of color in America, but also with etiquette guides from the 1800s. Similarly, Art After Trump is a political abecedarius with all-capitalized lines spelling out phrases like \\"SUPERLATIVE SUBJUGATION\\" and \\"PIGMENTED PRIVILEGE\\". Education Rasheed holds an M.A. in Secondary Education from Stanford University and received a B.A. in 2006 from Pomona College in Public Policy and Africana Studies. Awards and fellowships Rasheed has been the recipient of numerous grants, fellowships, and residencies, including: 2016 * Artist-in-residence, Bronx Museum of Art Co-Lab Residency  New York, NY * Artist-in-residence, Creative Exchange Lab - Portland Institute of Contemporary Art  Portland, OR * Artist-in-residence, Smack Mellon  Brooklyn, NY * Artist-in-residence, The Center for Afrofuturist Studies at Public Space One  Iowa City, IA * Copy Shop Resident, Endless Editions at Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop  New York, NY * Shortlisted, Visionary Award from the Tim Hetherington Trust  New York, NY * Fellow, Ossian Fellowship - Jain Family Institute  New York, NY 2015 * Artist-in-residence, Lower East Side Print Shop  New York, NY * Commissioned Artist/Scholar in Residence, Triple Canopy at New York Public Library Labs  New York, NY * Grantee, Artadia: The Fund for Art and Dialogue  New York, NY * Fellow, Artist Fellowship, AIR Gallery  Brooklyn, NY * Fellow, Queens Museum ‚Äì Jerome Foundation Fellowship Program, Queens Museum  Queens, NY * Fellow, Artist in the Marketplace (AIM 35), Bronx Museum  Bronx, NY 2014 * Grantee, Art Matters Foundation  New York, NY * Grantee, Rema Hort Mann Foundation Emerging Artist Grant  New York, NY * Artist-in-residence, Working Classrooms  Albuquerque, NM * Artist-in-residence, Vermont Studio Center  Johnson, VT 2013 * Fellow (Create Change Professional Development), The Laundromat Project  New York, NY * Juror, Center for Photography at Woodstock A-I-R  Woodstock, NY * Artist-in-residence, Center for Book Arts  New York, NY * Artist-in- residence, Visual Artist Network - Real Art Ways  Hartford, CT * Grantee, Visual Artist Network Community Fund - Real Art Ways  Hartford, CT 2012 * Awardee, STEP UP - Real Arts Ways  Hartford, CT * Artist-in-residence, Center for Photography at Woodstock  Woodstock, New York 2006 * United States Fulbright Amy S.

The mountain is part of the Cascade Range. Gunn Peak is the highest point of the Wild Sky Wilderness. The mountain was named for homesteader/miner Amos Gunn who started the nearby town of Index, Washington, and also named nearby Mount Index.Gunn Peak peakware.com Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skykomish River. Climate Gunn Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

She uses sculpture, collage, painting, installation, and printmaking methods such as silkscreen, lithography, and woodblock. In 2007 Wilson moved from Brooklyn, New York to Carrizozo, New Mexico (population 996) where she currently lives and works with her woodworking partner Mike Lagg. Early life Paula Wilson grew up in Hyde Park on the south side of Chicago where her father, William Julius Wilson, was a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. Her mother, Beverly Ann Wilson, is an artist and bookbinder. Education Paula Wilson attended Washington University (St. Louis, MO) from 1994‚Äì1998, earning her B.F.A. and graduating summa cum laude. Wilson earned her M.F.A. from Columbia University (New York, NY) in 2005. Life and work Wilson is known for her monumental and tactile work describing narratives and environments that fit her experience as a biracial black woman. She reimagines art historical tropes and inserts versions of herself into the landscape and canon. Shifting between graphic and painterly representations, she builds narratives by collapsing pictorial planes. Wilson‚Äôs work is anchored in self-portrait, printmaking, installation, and collage. She prints images with wood blocks, silkscreens, intaglio, and monotypes; layers acrylic, oil, and spray paint; shoots videos inserting 2-D work into the landscape; she cuts, glues, and stitches to make colorful, dense assemblages. Her works often burst from their wall or frame, reflecting a constant re-assembly of lived experiences: black and white, urban and rural, traditional and contemporary, singular and collective. Wilson is co-founder of the artist organizations MoMAZoZo (founded in 2010) and the Carrizozo Artist in Residency (AIR)(founded in 2016). = Academia = Wilson was a Visiting Critic at Yale School of Art from 2005‚Äì2007 and an Assistant Professor at Columbia University School of the Arts from 2007‚Äì2008. In 2015 she served as the Louis D. Beaumont Artist-in-Residence & Visiting Assistant Professor in the College and Graduate School of Art in the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts at Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.

The act is notable for expanding the Community Right to Buy established by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 to include urban communities and for introducing new powers for Scottish Ministers to compel owners of abandoned or neglected to land to interested community bodies. Provisions Provisions of the act are spread over eleven parts, covering different areas relating to community empowerment and public participation in policy and planning. 30px This content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. Part 1, National Outcomes, requires Scottish Ministers to continue the existing practice of setting national outcomes for Scotland, to which public authorities, people and organisations are to have regard when carrying out public functions. Ministers must regularly report progress toward them and to review them at least every five years. Part 2, Community Planning, creates a statutory basis for Community Planning Partnerships, imposing duties on them to involve community bodies in the delivery of local outcomes and to produce ‚Äúlocality plans‚Äù for particularly disadvantaged areas. Part 3, Participation Requests, provides a mechanism for community bodies to request participation in services to improve local outcomes, which can include community bodies taking responsibility for the delivery of services. Part 4, Community Rights to Buy Land, amends the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 to extend the community right to by to communities of any size, allowing urban communities to register an interest in land granting them first right of refusal should the land come up for sale. The act also introduces a new community right to buy land which is abandoned, neglected or causing harm to the environmental wellbeing of the community. This allows Scottish ministers to compel private owners of land to community bodies if they deem the sale likely to contribute to sustainable local development. Part 5, Asset Transfer Requests, provides community bodies with the right to request to purchase, lease, manage or use land and buildings held by local authorities, Scottish ministers and other Scottish public bodies, of which relevant authorities will be required to create and maintain a publicly available register. In deciding whether to agree to asset transfers, public bodies are to consider the reduction of inequalities though there is a presumption of agreement unless there are reasonable grounds for refusal. Part 6, Delegation of Forestry Commissioners‚Äô Functions, allows for different types of community body to be involved in forestry leasing and to request asset transfers from Scotland‚Äôs National Forest Estate. Part 7, Football Clubs, provides powers for Ministers to make regulations to facilitate supporters‚Äô involvement in the decision making, and potentially ownership, of football clubs and give fans rights in these areas. Part 8, Common Good Property, requires local authorities to establish and maintain a register of all common good property which they hold. It also requires local authorities to inform and consult community bodies before disposing of or changing the use of common good assets. Part 9, Allotments, updates and simplifies legislation on allotments. It requires local authorities to take reasonable steps to provide allotments if waiting lists exceed certain trigger points and strengthens the protection for allotments. Provisions allow allotments to be 250 square metres in size or a different size that is to be agreed between the person requesting an allotment and the local authority. The Act also requires fair rents to be set and allows tenants to sell surplus produce grown on an allotment, provided this is not intended to produce a profit. There is a requirement for local authorities to develop a food growing strategy for their area, including identifying land that may be used as allotment sites and identifying other areas of land that could be used by a community for the cultivation of vegetables, fruit, herbs or flowers. Part 10, Participation in Public Decision-Making, creates new regulation-making powers enabling Ministers to require Scottish public authorities to promote and facilitate public participation in the decisions and activities of the authority, including in the allocation of its resources.

It describes the history of immunology with the discovery of the principle of graft rejection by Peter Medawar, and the way the body distinguishes self from not-self via natural killer cells. The compatibility mechanism contributes also to the success of pregnancy by helping the placenta to form, and may play a role in mate selection. Context =Author= Daniel M. Davis has a doctorate in physics from Strathclyde University. He was professor of molecular immunology at Imperial College and director of research at the University of Manchester's collaborative centre for inflammation research. Davis is a recognised as an expert in the field by the Nature journal of immunology. =Subject= The book's context is the history of immunology, from old questions about why we become ill and why we may recover to the 19th century pioneers who demonstrated that bacteria caused many diseases. In the 20th century where, slowly at first but at an accelerating pace, biologists started to piece together the genetic basis of variation and natural selection, and alongside that, the foundations of scientific medicine, including immunology. As Steven Pinker observes, few stories of scientific endeavour have never been told. \\"This is one of them. Ostensibly about a set of genes that we all have and need, this book is really about the men and women who discovered them and worked out what they do. It‚Äôs about brilliant insights and lucky guesses; the glory of being proved right and the paralysing fear of getting it wrong; the passion for cures and the lust for Nobels. It‚Äôs a search for the essence of scientific greatness by a scientist who is headed that way himself.\\" Book =Contents= Part One: The Scientific Revolution in Compatibility 1. Frankenstein's Holy Trinity : Davis tells the story of Peter Medawar's life and discoveries in graft rejection. 2. Self / Non-self : In this chapter, Davis tours the history of medicine from Hippocrates to the 19th century pioneers Pasteur and Koch, and Frank Macfarlane Burnet's concept of the immune system's ability to discriminate self from non-self. 3. Dead but Alive in Parts : Advances in understanding of immunity, from Karl Landsteiner's discovery of the ABO blood group system onwards, permit organ transplants to take place. The compatibility genes are named as three class I HLA genes (A, B, and C) and three class II (DP, DQ, and DR), each with numerous versions (alleles). 4. A Crystal-clear Answer at Last : Davis tells the human side of the story of the discovery of killer T-cells. Alan Townsend found that killer T-cells destroyed cells that carried an HLA protein and small fragments of viral protein. Those small peptides were all the evidence the T-cells needed to decide that a cell was diseased. Part Two: The Frontier of Compatibility Gene Research Diagram showing the complementary activities of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells 5. Differences between Us that Matter : Genetic differences from one person to another, like having the allele for Huntington's disease, can be small but decisive. An HLA protein variant, B*27, is associated with a serious inherited disease, ankylosing spondylitis, but also protects against AIDS. Other variants protected against other diseases. Perhaps the polymorphisms in HLA, the many forms each HLA gene can take, are maintained by natural selection for competing factors. 6. A Path to New Medicine : Variations in HLA genes may predict which drugs will be beneficial for individuals, implying a new era of personalised medicine. 7. Missing Self : Davis tells the story of how Klas K√§rre came up with the concept of the missing self, a sign (by the absence of an HLA protein) that a cell was diseased, and should be killed by a Natural Killer (NK) cell. Part Three: The Overarching System 8. Sex and Smelly T-shirts : The chapter describes the famous experiment that called for female partners to sniff boxes containing their male partners' T-shirts, which they had worn for two days. There was a slight association between finding the smell sexy and the two partners having different compatibility genes. It could possibly indicate sexual selection for outbreeding, at least in the HLA system. 9. Connections with the Mind : Davis describes what is known of the role of compatibility genes in the brain. 10. Compatibility for Successful Pregnancy Chorionic villi : The chapter tells the story of how the variable genes of the immune system affect the success of pregnancy. Far from the baby's HLA proteins somehow being tolerated by the mother (unlike anyone else's), the strong reaction against the baby's antigens helps to drive proper development of the placenta, in particular the growth of chorionic villi that ensure efficient transfer (for instance of oxygen) between mother and baby. Epilogue: What Makes You So Special? : Davis tells a story of genetic compatibility between his wife and himself. He finds himself wondering whether all women should have found him exceptionally attractive, at least when he was younger. He ends by observing that there is no hierarchy in HLA: some variants are good in one situation, and bad in another. =Publication= The book was published in paperback by Penguin in August 2014, . =Reception= The Compatibility Gene has been well received by critics and scientists. Mark Viney, reviewing the book in the New Scientist, comments that Davis covers human compatibility genes well, but that he should have gone into more detail on the different systems in other organisms. The science writer Peter Forbes, writing in The Guardian, notes that when Watson and Crick cracked the genetic code in 1953, it seemed that medicine would instantly profit: but half a century went by before the genome was decoded, and 98% of it seemed at first glance to be junk DNA. Now its complexity is starting to be understood, one function at a time. One specialised area is the immune system, with its own ultra-variable set of proteins. They are not only complicated, but have many functions, in immunity, sexual attraction (perhaps), pregnancy, and brain function. Unsurprisingly, Forbes observes, this makes immunology, and its popularisation, \\"extremely difficult\\". Davis \\"sugars the pill\\" by choosing to go into the researchers' lives and struggles in great detail. Forbes notes that Davis does not mention that most of the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees are to do with the immune system and brain development: perhaps (he suggests) these are connected. Nicola Davis, reviewing the book in The Times, writes that Davis \\"weaves a warm biographical thread through his tale of scientific discovery, revealing the drive and passion of those in the vanguard of research.\\" The tale of the pioneers such as Medawar is \\"fairly familiar but Davis's readable narrative allows them to be seen afresh\\". She finds the account more challenging as it approaches more recent discoveries, but with \\"plenty of rewarding moments\\". Emily Banham, reviewing the book for Nature, notes that compatibility genes lie at the heart of our immune systems, playing a part in the success of skin grafts, pregnancy, and more. The biologist Rebecca Nesbit, reviewing The Compatibility Gene for The Biologist, writes that Davis shares many stories of dedicated scientists, brought together by \\"a small cluster of 'compatibility genes' which play a large role in how we react to disease, and are central to how our immune systems work.\\" She notes that the book is as much about the people as the discoveries, but these are made worthwhile by the medical advances they keep producing, for example with possibilities for personalised medicine, as when people with one particular compatibility gene react adversely to an AIDS drug. She observes that all the same, he ends with the scientist's favourite refrain: \\"more research needed\\".

Space Capone has released three albums, two independently: Vol. I: Transformation (2008) and Vol II: Arrival, Arousal (2010); and Space Capone, through AVJ Records (2012). Early life Winters grew up on a farm in Carthage, Indiana and was influenced by his father's vinyl record collection including Jim Croce, Eric Clapton, and country music and oldies. He didn't start writing songs and singing until he was 17. Winters attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio (2001-2003) before moving to Nashville, Tennessee and transferring to Belmont University in 2003. He released two EPs under his own name: Ocean Airliner (2004) and Supernatural Delight (2006), while living in Nashville. For the EPs, he had taken creative influences from his past and started to blend soul, funk and rock into his writing. Career =Vol I: Transformation (2008)= After releasing Supernatural Delight in 2006, Winters' influences began to diversify as he started listening more to late 70s and early 80s R&B;, such as Earth, Wind & Fire, Rick James, and Michael Jackson. He also began to experiment with falsetto vocals. He decided that creating a character to elevate the mystique behind the songs was necessary and came up with Space Capone. Winters said it looked good on paper and fit the music he was writing at the time. Vol I: Transformation symbolized his transformation from Aaron Winters to Space Capone. Once the songs were written, he hired arranger and musician Calvin Turner (Raphael Saddiq, Marc Broussard) to produce the album. Turner hired drummer Marcus Finnie (Kirk Whalum, Michael McDonald) and had him record all the songs with no accompaniment or music. All instruments and vocals were added after the drums had been tracked. Musicians on Transformation included DeMarco Johnson (keyboards), Court Clement (guitar) and Calvin Turner (bass, string and horn arrangements). The album was recorded in a house in Nashville. Winters was featured on TBS Entertainment's Sound Check in 2009. Nashville Scene reviewed the album by saying, \\"Harmonically sophisticated, Transformation is a commercial funk record that effortlessly combines banality and exactitude in its search for a plausible heaven\\". =Vol II: Arrival, Arousal (2010)= Winters formed a core band around the release of Transformation, including Ben Stix (drums), Drew Wilson (bass) Sam Farkas (guitar) Mikie Martel (trumpet, synthesizer), Joe D. Douglas (Saxophone) and Neal Dahlgren (keyboards). They began touring regionally in the Southeast. Space Capone began to garner a fan base, playing festivals including Nashville's Live on the Green Music Festival (2009), New York's CMJ (2009), Bulldog Bash (2010) and Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival (2010). The Bonnaroo performance was won by entering a live competition sponsored by BMI in competition with 28 other bands, where Space Capone and three other acts won the spot to play the festival. In June 2010 they played a Nashville Flood charity event, opening for Ke$ha. While not on the road, Winters worked as a carpenter in Nashville. He hired Calvin Turner again to produce the second release, Vol II: Arrival, Arousal. After getting some demo recordings together, Turner hired John Robinson to play drums on four songs, which he did remotely from his home in Los Angeles. Lamar Carter played drums on the rest of the album. Turner enlisted Johnson and Clement again as well. =Space Capone (2012)= After releasing Arrival, Arousal independently in 2010, booking agent Brian Waymire signed Space Capone to Buddy Lee Attractions. Winters continued to tour and garnered the attention of AVJ Records, an imprint of the independent label Average Joes Entertainment, with which he signed a deal in 2011. Space Capone then recorded their self-titled album with Turner, Winters and Dahlgren all co-producing under the moniker \\"Hot Concrete\\". Turner hired Jerry Hey (Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Toto) to arrange the horns, and had Jay Graydon (Airplay, Steely Dan) featured as a guitarist on the song \\"Naturally\\". The first single was the only song taken from previous recordings, the track \\"I Just Wanna Dance,\\" which was originally recorded on Transformation and re-released digitally on November 15, 2011. The music video featured Lauren Glazier. Following the release of Space Capone, the live band continued touring and continued to play clubs and festivals including LouFest, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Hangout Music Festival, Summerfest, Bear Creek, Rombello, Spring Fest, Bele Chere and Lollapalooza; when Space Capone played Summerfest they were direct support for Kool & the Gang.

(Wyoming is south of the town of Spring Green). The building is on the Taliesin estate and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. History The windmill was designed in 1896 after being commissioned by Wright's aunts, Jane and Ellen Lloyd Jones, who needed the windpump to provide water for their school,The Home News, September 23, 1897, p. 3. \\"The waterworks at the Hillside Home have been enlarged by a reservoir of 1000 barrels capacity tunneled into the rock of Sand Hill, back of the school building. ...

The diamond-shaped portion of the windmill intersects the portion with the balcony that sits on an octagonal structure. The balcony is accessible through an interior stairway. Wright named these two parts of the building \\"Romeo\\" and \\"Juliet\\". \\"Romeo\\" is the lozenge and Juliet, the octagon. Architectural historian, Neil Levine explained the principles behind the lozenge and octagon: > [Wright] gave the tower a bold geometric form as a structural solution to > the expression of the tower's role as a landmark.

According to the local Spring Green newspaper, The Weekly Home News, the windmill was completed in 1897.Weekly Home News, September 30, 1897. The Romeo and Juliet Windmill was the second structure the aunts commissioned from Wright. The first one, which no longer exists, was Hillside Home School I built in 1887. The third structure designed by Wright for the Hillside Home School was a stone educational facility, the Hillside Home School II, known today as the Hillside Home School, since it is the only one of the two that still exists. The Taliesin Historic District Romeo and Juliet is one of five buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright on what became his property, which is now known as the Taliesin estate. From the windmill, it is possible to see three of the other structures on the Taliesin estate: his home Taliesin is on an adjacent hill to the north, Tan-y-Deri (his sister's house) is near the windmill's base, and the Hillside Home School is down the hill to windmill's south. Also on the estate is the farming structure, Midway Barn. Construction Originally clad in shingles, the windmill was later re-clad in cypress board and batten in 1938.William Allin Storrer.

Gameplay The player uses the yellow periscope to aim at the moving submarines on the screen. Pressing the button on the right handle will fire a torpedo, and the goal is to shoot down all of the submarines in the fastest amount of time. The farther the submarine is, the more points the player will receive, with green being the closest, and red being the farthest. The game ends when the timer on the cabinet reaches zero. Reception and legacy The November 11, 1978 issue of Cashbox called it \\"\\"one of the most realistic\\" games of its kind \\"ever put into a cabinet\\", while the December 30 issue noted of the game's realistic design and gameplay features. In 1999, Namco demonstrated a sequel to Submarine, titled , at the Amusement Machine Operator's Union (AMOU) tradeshow in Tokyo.

The Public High School enrolls 9th12th Graders in the Howard Lake-Waverly-Winsted Public School District. As of 2019, the school had 315 students enrolled. The campus consists of the High School, complete with a Gymnasium, the Laker Theater, the Middle School, with a field house housing three full-court basketball courts, a walking track, a weight room; a Football Field; the Track; several Baseball Fields; a School Garden; and the District's Bus Garage.  History  The previous building was built in 1930 and located in the city of Howard Lake. It had additions built in 1947 and 1954, as well as the addition of Humphrey Hall in 1966. In its latter years it served as the middle school for the school district after the new high school was constructed. But due to the expensive repairs that were needed, a new middle school was built and the old complex demolished with the exception of the Humphrey Hall area, which was renovated. That portion of the school is now home to the Meeker and Wright Special Education Cooperative as well as the HLWW Alternative Learning Program. It still possesses its gymnasium which is attached to Humphrey Hall which is also used for the Laker gymnastics practices and home meets. The current building is located between Howard Lake, Minnesota and Winsted, Minnesota. It was constructed in 2006 and connected to the Middle School in 2016.The Lakers text over the entrance of the building.  Extracurricular activities  HLWW is a member of the Central Minnesota Conference and will join the Wright County West Conference in 2021. The HLWW School District offers the following activities. Sports: *Fall  Cross Country  Football  Volleyball *Winter  Boys/Girls Basketball  Gymnastics  Wrestling *Spring  Baseball/Softball  Golf  Track and Field Other activities: * Band *Choir *Cheerleading * Clay Target *Drama *FFA * KLKR StudiosKLKR Studios * Knowledge Bowl *Speech  The Laker Theatre  The Laker Stage, from the back of the auditorium with some of the stage lights turned on and an empty set. The Laker Theatre is an Auditorium located within the high school, which hosts the school district's band and choir concerts, plays and musicals, as well as occasionally hosting community productions. The auditorium has a main floor which has a seating capacity of 458 seats, and a balcony, only accessible by stairs which can seat an additional 130 persons. The auditorium was built with the school but was not finished until 2009, the balcony of which was not finished until the Middle School was added to the complex.  The Laker Gymnasium  The Laker Gymnasium has a main court with basketball lines and a main volleyball court in the middle of two roll-out bleachers. However, for some youth tournaments the gym can be converted to two courts by rolling back the bleachers and lowering a curtain which is above the half court line of the main court. There are motorized basketball hoops situated on the ceiling that can be raised and lowered depending on the requirements. The gym also has two Daktronics scoreboards which are used in tandem during main events but can be operated independently if the gym is separated to two courts. One of the scoreboards has additional side player panels which display additional information about active players during the game. The gymnasium located adjacent to the Laker Theatre in the High School hosts the Laker's home Basketball and Volleyball games, as well as Wrestling meets. It will also occasionally be the host site of some playoff games however the location is not ideal because of a smaller seating capacity, therefore larger games are scheduled elsewhere.  Campus  = Laker Football Field and Track = The Laker Football Field and Track is a prominent fixture on campus, as athletic events which occur here attract spectators. It contains the football field encircled by the track, and has bleacher seating, a press box on top of the bleachers, a Daktronics, football scoreboard which can be switched to displaying track results, stadium lighting, and a basic loudspeaker system. Early in 2019, a new, permanent concession stand was installed below the bleachers replacing a temporary trailer that had been previously used since the high school was built.  Football field  The natural grass football field on campus is a standard American football field, which is home to the Laker's Junior Varsity and Varsity home games. The field has irrigation lines which keeps the grass healthy during the summer. The football field's end zones and mid-field are typically painted with the Laker emblem with the help of volunteers. The team practices on a smaller field that is directly south of the stadium field and is irrigated as well. = Merger failures = Due to dwindling numbers in the football program, a proposal was brought forward to the school board August, 2018; to merge with the local Watertown-Mayer team to create a Co-op. This measure failed to pass as while it was approved by HLWW, Watertown-Mayer only approved a proposal which would have all the 'home' games be played at their field, to which HLWW did not approve. This created a large controversy among football parents and the activities department citing player safety concerns.  Track  The 400 starting side of the Laker Track. The Laker Track is a standard 400m track with a black rubber surface. The track has an additional space spanning the circle on the north end for high jump, and as an additional fenced-in area with three runways, two of which lead to triple and long jump pits, and one which has pole-vault capabilities. There are also sand traps for shot put in this area. Discus takes place on the football practice field on the northeast side of the campus. = Resurfacing problems = The track was resurfaced during the summer of 2016, and during the subsequent spring it was discovered that due to improper drainage around the track combined with heavy precipitation, pockets had formed under the track surface and pushed different parts up. Due to the safety concerns, no home meets were held there that year and the school was faced with fixing the issue. The track was resurfaced during the summer of 2018, which involved complete removal and installation of a proper drainage system.

This approach stands in contrast to routine practice in probabilistic programming where human developers manually write new probabilistic programs.  The framework  Bayesian program synthesis (BPS) has been described as a framework related to and utilizing probabilistic programming. In BPS, probabilistic programs are generated that are themselves priors over a space of probabilistic programs. This strategy allows automatic synthesis of new programs via probabilistic inference and is achieved by the composition of modular component programs. The modularity in BPS allows inference to work on and test smaller probabilistic programs before being integrated into a larger model. This framework can be contrasted with the family of automated program synthesis fields, which include programming by example and programming by demonstration. The goal in such fields is to find the best program that satisfies some constraint. In traditional program synthesis, for instance, verification of logical constraints reduce the state space of possible programs, allowing more efficient search to find an optimal program. Bayesian program synthesis differs both in that the constraints are probabilistic and the output is itself a distribution over programs that can be further refined. Additionally, Bayesian program synthesis can be contrasted to the work on Bayesian program learning, where probabilistic program components are hand-written, pre-trained on data, and then hand assembled in order to recognize handwritten characters.

Only a few members of this gens are mentioned in history, of whom the most famous is unquestionably the poet Publius Ovidius Naso, but others are known from inscriptions. Origin In his Tristia, Ovid explains that he was descended from an ancient family of equestrian rank, but only moderate wealth. He was born at Sulmo, in the country of the Paeligni, an Oscan-speaking people of central Italy, related to the Sabines and Samnites.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 68 (\\"Publius Ovidius Naso\\"). The nomen Ovidius would seem to belong to a class of gentilicia formed from other names using the common name-forming suffix -idius, in which case it might be a patronymic surname based on the Oscan praenomen Ovius. Alternatively, the name might have been derived from a cognomen Ovis, referring to a sheep. Chase also mentions a nomen Ofidius, an orthographic variant of Aufidius, derived from the river Aufidus; Ovidius could perhaps be another orthography.Chase, pp. 121, 122, 124, 139, 140.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. ovis, ovillus. Praenomina The praenomina found most frequently among the Ovidii are Lucius and Gaius, although they also used Quintus, Marcus, Publius, and in at least one instance, Titus. These were the most common names throughout Roman history. Branches and cognomina The only important surname of the Ovidii was Naso, borne by the poet. This was a relatively common cognomen, describing someone with a large or prominent nose, although it is not known whether Ovid himself had such a feature, or whether the surname was originally bestowed upon one of his ancestors.Chase, p. 109. Members * Lucius Ovidius, the elder brother of Ovid, died at the age of twenty.Ovid, Tristia, iv. 10. * Publius Ovidius Naso, the poet, was trained as an orator, like his brother, and for a time pleaded in the law courts, before becoming one of the triumviri capitales, and subsequently one of the centumviri, then one of the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, both important judicial appointments. In AD 8, he was exiled by Augustus for reasons that remain mysterious.Ovid, Tristia, passim.Seneca, Controversiae, ii. 10.PIR, vol. II, pp. 441, 442. * Quintus Ovidius, a dear friend of the poet Martial, who owned a neighboring estate at Nomentum, where both produced wine. When Maximus Caesonius was banished by Nero, Ovidius followed his friend into exile. Later, Martial laments Ovidius' impending travel to Caledonia, and hopes he will return to Italy in his old age.Martial, i. 105, vii. 44, 45, 93, ix. 52, 53, 98, x. 44, xiii. 119.PIR, vol.

Design The Ballplayers House recalls Vaux's design, albeit much altered in form and detail. In contrast to the brick and bluestone facade of Vaux's building, with its pointed arches and polychrome voussoirs, the facade of Ballplayers House is composed with graphic stripes of highly contrasting brick. In lieu of Vaux's bracketed eaves, pointed pinnacles and chamfered chimney, the new building boasts a simple roofline, topped with a sleek, factory-made cresting.

It is a shrub with thick, stiff stems, leaves with a sharp point on the tip and heads of usually cream-coloured flowers. Description Conothamnus trinervis is an erect or straggly shrub that typically grows to a height of and has thick, stiff branches. The leaves are usually arranged in opposite pairs, sometimes in whorls of three, long with three veins and a sharp point on the tip. The flowers are yellow, cream-coloured or white, occasionally purple and arranged in heads about across. Each group of three flowers has a bract at its base and the flowers have five sepals and five petals. (The other two species of Conothamnus lack petals, and the flowers are in groups of two.) Flowering occurs between August and October. Taxonomy and naming Conothamnus trinervis was first formally described in 1839 by John Lindley who published the description in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (trinervis) is derived from the Latin prefix tri- meaning \\"three\\" and nervus meaning \\"sinew\\" or \\"tendon\\". Distribution and habitat This shrub is found along the west coast on the Swan Coastal Plain and in the Mid West and Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia where it grows in deep sandy lateritic soils in kwongan.

Facts The German Electricity Feed-in Act 1998 ¬ß¬ß2-3 (Stromeinspeisungsgesetz 1998) required regional electricity distribution companies to buy electricity from renewable energy sources in their area of supply at fixed minimum prices. Upstream energy suppliers were obliged to compensate distribution companies for additional costs. PreussenElektra AG (now part of E.ON), a privately owned upstream supplier, complained that the law was not compatible with the prohibition on state aid, then in TEC article 92(1) (now TFEU article 107(1)) even though it was a requirement of private entities to compensate one another. PreussenElektra and the Commission argued that (1) financial duties on regional distribution companies, like Schleswag, reduced the undertakings‚Äô earnings, and reduced tax receipts for the states (2) the law converted private resources into public ones, with the same effect as a tax, and (3) because 6 of the 9 big upstream suppliers of energy were by majority state-owned, and 60% of shares in regional electricity suppliers were publicly owned, the payments should be considered state aid.

It is based in Lagos, Nigeria. History SystemSpecs was founded in 1991 by John Obaro. It was then more like a business to business company selling software to organisations. SystemSpecs started as a 5-man partner agent and Value added reseller for SunSystems, an accounting package developed by Systems Union, UK, (now Infor). The indigenous company developed HumanManager, a payroll Human Resource Management and goal management software package. This was developed with object-oriented COBOL. Media reports indicates that it enjoyed wide market acceptability with over 200 organizations across Africa as at 2004. TheSOFTtribe of Ghana signed a partnership deal with SystemSpecs in 2006 to provide 'HumanManager' for the Ghanaian market. The agreement authorized TheSOFTtribe to become Ghanaian partner of SystemSpecs for marketing, deployment and professional support of HumanManager. HumanManager went on to become \\"well established within the sub- regional ICT market.\\" HumanManager was described by the Nigerian media as \\"Nigerian's most successful software yet\\" when SystemSpecs launched HumanManager 4.0 in December 2002. The solution passed \\"a world class automated Quality Assurance test\\" in 2004. Infor FMS SunSystems and Infor PM are other SystemSpecs products. SystemSpecs recorded another major breakthrough in software development with the creation of the financial remittance software called Remita. HumanManager Developed by SystemSpecs, HumanManager is an intuitive, innovative and easy-to-use Human Capital Management Solution for organisations of all sizes and structures across Africa. The solution combines prosaic and innovative features such as payroll management, pensions, employee management, training and self-service among others. The functionality of HumanManager prompted its adoption across Africa, into such countries as Benin Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, to name but a few. Remita Remita is the e-payments and e-collections platform developed by SystemSpecs Limited. Remita, a Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) licensed platform, is developed in Nigeria and helps organisations and individuals receive and make payments. The software, which has become the flagship creation of the company, is used by the Central Bank of Nigeria for payment and collections of funds on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria for the treasury single account (TSA). It is also used by all 22 commercial banks and over 400 micro finance banks in Nigeria. Through TSA, the Nigerian government was reported to have saved \\"trillions of naira usually lost to corruption because of the opaque nature of government accounting.\\" The Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, revealed that 5.24 trillion naira has been realised as inflows into the TSA account following the mopping-up and direct debits of accounts of the CBN. He had earlier declared at the ICAN UK International Zonal Conference that the Federal Government of Nigeria had recorded 3 trillion naira ($15 billion) inflows into the TSA as at the first quarter of 2016 from Ministries, Departments and Agencies numbering up to 976. SystemSpecs released the Remita Mobile Application in March 2017. Paylink Paylink is SystemSpecs‚Äô recently released payment solution for individuals, businesses and NGOs. The solution enables users to receive payments easily by simply sharing a link with their payers via social media, email, WhatsApp, or other preferred channels, and is fast gaining acceptance among merchants across Africa as a fast, affordable and reliable platform for funds collection, especially for semi-formal businesses. The Treasury Single Account Controversy A Nigerian senator, Dino Melaye had claimed that the appointment of Remita, which he erroneously described as \\"an e-collection agent\\", was a violation of section 162 (1) of the Nigerian Constitution. He claimed that the constitution only recognised a banking institution to be the collector of government funds, and that Remita was not a bank. The senator said the one per cent commission charged by SystemSpecs for all revenues collected on behalf of the government from the various ministries, departments and agencies must be returned to the account of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He estimated the amount of commission collected by SystemSpecs to be twenty-five billion naira. In a letter titled ‚ÄúCommencement of Federal Government independent revenue collection under the Treasury Single Account (TSA) initiative‚Äù addressed to the press, the Central Bank of Nigeria refuted the senator's claims, describing them as \\"misleading\\". Nonetheless, SystemSpecs, as a \\"business decision\\" speedily obeyed CBN's directive that all the revenues made so far be returned pending the issue would be resolved. The Nigerian Senate consequently ordered its committee on finance and public accounts to \\"commence an investigation into the use of Remita since the inception of the TSA policy. Founder and Managing Director of SystemSpecs, developers of the Remita application, John Obaro, refuted claims that company pocketed 25 billion Naira. Obaro explained that the one per cent commission was negotiated prior to the signing of the contract; and the one per cent commission was shared by SystemSpecs, participating commercial banks and the Central Bank of Nigeria in the ratio of 50:40:10 respectively. PremiumTimes, an online news platform, released a report titled 'Full details of TSA: Dino Melaye misled Nigerian Senate on N25 billion claim' which cited holes in the senator's claims and allegations. The Joint Senate investigative committee also absolved SystemSpecs of any wrongdoing as ‚Äúthe committee could not ascertain the deduction/collection of twenty-five billion Naira (N25 billion) by SystemSpecs as 1% fee charged for the use of its Remita platform within the period under investigation.‚Äù .

Bruce Hall Burgmann College Burgmann from the front lawn. Burgmann College, established in 1971, it is the only Australian college to combine undergraduate accommodation with a substantial postgraduate student body. It houses 351 students, roughly one-third of whom are postgraduates. Burgmann College is located inside the western corner of the campus, close to the waters of Lake Burley Griffin. The college is named after Ernest H. Burgmann (1885-1967), the progressive Anglican Bishop (of Goulburn from 1934, and Canberra and Goulburn from 1950 to 1960). Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd met his wife Th√©r√®se Rein while both living at the college. Burgmann College and neighbouring John XXIII College are the only remaining independent residential colleges among the Australian National University's ten halls of residence.

It held that the Secretary of State could stop scheme supporting renewable electricity, without breaching legitimate expectations, misusing power, or unfairness in a judicial review claim. Facts Solar Century Ltd claimed the SS breached legitimate expectations, misused power, and acted unfairly by stopping the ‚Äòrenewables obligation‚Äô for larger projects. Solar Century Ltd installed large solar photovoltaic systems (solar farms). It benefited from the renewables obligation scheme that started in 2002. In 2011, the renewables obligation was replaced with a ‚Äòcontracts for difference‚Äô scheme. The government capped spending for energy and climate change. The Energy Act 2013, inserting Electricity Act 1989 ss 32LA-LB, gave the Secretary of State power to close the renewables obligation to new capacity. This was initially proposed for 31 March 2017 for solar PV capacity over 5MW. A government statement said it would be ‚Äòmaintaining support levels for ... existing investments‚Äô. The SS then decided to close it on 1 April 2015, with the Renewables Obligation Closure (Amendment) Order 2015, saying takeup was higher than expected and its cap would be exceeded. It had a grace period to protect people who could demonstrate a significant financial commitment to projects at the consultation date. Solar Century argued they had a legitimate expectation from clear representations by government that the scheme would be open until 2017, the 2015 Order was ultra vires the Electricity Act 1989 ss 32LA-LB, and it was unfair to specify a date in the past as one for identifying a significant financial commitment. The government's decision, to be put into the Renewables Obligation Closure (Amendment) Order 2015, and the subject of the challenge was extracted by Floyd LJ: Judgment Floyd LJ held that the government could change its policy where there were rational grounds, unless it amounted to abuse of power. No legitimate expectations were created that the date might not change. The Electricity Act 1989 section 32LA was wide enough to allow the SS to put forward the closure of the renewables obligation scheme. The grace period was not unfair, because if it were lawful to close the whole scheme in 2015 it was hard to see how giving some exceptions would be a bad thing. Tomlinson LJ and Treacy LJ agreed.

It was founded in Duluth in 1907 and is one of the oldest art centers in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Based on the curatorial model of the German \\"kunsthalle\\", the DAI is a community arts center that works closely with artists and the community, creating associated symposia, workshops, and studios. The Duluth Art Institute has two locations. The main exhibition space is located in the Duluth Depot, the historic train station in Duluth that also houses the Lake Superior Railroad Museum, the St. Louis County Historical Society Museum, a Veteran's Memorial Hall, and several performing arts organizations. A second location is situated in the former Lincoln Branch Library, a 1915 Carnegie library building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. It serves as a community center for arts education and houses multipurpose classroom spaces, a darkroom, ceramics studios, a fiber studio, and professional development services for artists. History The Duluth Art Institute originated as an art club established by Bishop McGolrick in 1897. In 1907, the Duluth Art Association was officially incorporated. The original Board of Trustees included G.G. Hartley and Chester Adgate Congdon. In the 1930s, the Duluth Art Institute Association, a separate arts organization, was active. The organizations merged in 1946, retaining the name Duluth Art Institute Association. The organization later dropped the Association from their name. In 1976, the Duluth Art Institute relocated to the St. Louis County Heritage and Arts Center. The arts organization opened an additional location in the old Lincoln branch library in 1993. The Duluth Art Institute hosts a biennial that dates back to 1919. Formerly called the Arrowhead Art Exhibit, it is now known as the Arrowhead Biennial Exhibition. In 1990, the DAI auctioned off the eight paintings in its permanent collection because it was not equipped to care for the works. The paintings included pieces by Knute Heldner, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Charles Rosen, and David Ericson. The auction was criticized by the St. Louis County Historical Society and residents who wanted the art to stay in the community.  Artist residency  In March 2017 The Duluth Art Institute started an artist-in-residence program. The first artist to participate in the program was Duluth-based Paul LaJeunesse. The current artist-in-residence is painter Adam Swanson, who is working on a Public Art project to be unveiled in the summer of 2018.Duluth Art Institute press release References Further reading * Duluth Art Institute auctions its paintings, Star Tribune, Minneapolis, Minn., May 8, 1990 * Art Institute's curator resigns, Duluth News Tribune, April 2, 2010 * Duluth Art Institute's new curator is ready to let her artistic side bloom, Duluth News Tribune, July 1, 2010 * Photographer from Superior captured era for future historians, Duluth News Tribune, May 15, 2011 * Duluth Art Institute exhibit showcases spirit of Ochre Ghost Gallery, Duluth News Tribune, Nov. 6, 2011 * Duluth Art Institute hires new executive director, Duluth News Tribune, Nov. 19, 2011 * Best Bets: Duluth Art Institute Gallery Celebration begins, Duluth News Tribune, Jan. 12, 2012 * Duluth artist Brian Barber does it all, Duluth News Tribune, Apr. 19, 2012 * Two Harbors resident to direct the Duluth Art Institute, Lake County News-Chronicle, Aug. 23, 2012 * Duluth Art Institute members' disparate works explore many themes, Duluth News Tribune, Jan. 23, 2014 * Ness vs. Carlson: Art exhibit casts mayor, head shop owner as hero and villain, Duluth News Tribune, Apr. 10, 2014 * Arrowhead biennial art show features established, up-and-coming works, Duluth News Tribune, Nov. 10, 2016  External links  * http://www.duluthartinstitute.org/ 1907 establishments in Minnesota Arts centers in Minnesota Arts organizations established in 1907 Duluth, Minnesota ","title":"Duluth Art Institute"},{"id":"53394895","text":"The Donetsk Oblast Council () is the regional oblast council (parliament) of the Donetsk Oblast (province) located in eastern Ukraine.

The mountain is part of the North Cascades Range. Graybeard Peak straddles the North Cascades National Park boundary line, and can be seen from the North Cascades Highway at the Easy Pass Trailhead. Graybeard Peak is situated on Ragged Ridge. Other peaks on Ragged Ridge include Mesahchie Peak, Kimtah Peak, and Katsuk Peak. The nearest higher peak is Fisher Peak, to the south. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into Ross Lake via Granite Creek, whereas the west side of the mountain drains into Diablo Lake via Fisher Creek. Climate Graybeard Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. Graybeard Peak from Maple Pass loop trailAs fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Graybeard Peak and Little Tack The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

In two weeks, the video had received over 13 million views. A month after release, the video had over 17 million views. By May 2019, the video reached 30 million views. Reaction Russian state-owned media and most of privately held media have completely ignored the controversial revelations. Initially there was no reaction from Dmitry Medvedev or other high-ranking Russian government officials. On March 10, Medvedev blocked Alexei Navalny on Instagram. In response, Navalny led country-wide street protests on March 26, with a stated goal of forcing Putin and Medvedev to respond to Navalny's accusations. Following the end of March protest action, Medvedev claimed that the movie was shot specifically as an excuse for it, while accusations of corruption were 'made up on compote principle from weird stuff, nonsense and some pieces of paper'.https://ria.ru/20170404/1491479101.html According to Stephen Sestanovich, Navalny \\"has forced the president of Russia to stop pretending that he is against corruption.

She did not allow any witnesses to appear in front of the court or review the documents that the investigation was based on. Navalny said that the verdict in Usmanov's favor should bring even more people to the streets at upcoming protests.

She had remarried to Dr. James Stewart, Bytown's coroner from 1845 to 1858. William was well educated at public and grammar schools in Hull and Bytown and the monitorial High School in Montreal, where his principal was the Reverend John Bethune (1791‚Äì1872), masonic master, Anglican Dean of Montreal and founding Principal of McGill University. He was subsequently tutored in the classics by an ex-university teacher, the Reverend Dr. Alexander Fletcher of South Plantagenet. With his military ancestry and his Protestant loyalty to the Crown and Canada, William joined a regiment of volunteers mustered in 1837 in response to the Upper and Lower Canada Rebellions.

By 1862, Lett had also risen to third degree standing in the Grand Doric (Ottawa) Lodge of the Masons of Canada and graduated as Master Mason in 1888. His memberships in the Orange Order and the Freemasons were not only expressions of his Protestantism, temperance and loyalty to the British Crown, but also provided the contacts and networks important to furthering his career.

However, this was followed by 13 years of thespian silence until, in 1850, Lett organised and presided over Bytown's first drama club in the town hall. In 1854, he promoted his anti-slavery agenda with a staging of Uncle Tom's Cabin by a professional troupe from New York.

His father, William Hinton, had escaped being burned alive in a barn in Ireland during the Scullabogue Massacre of 1798, thanks to a warning by a faithful Catholic maid who lost her own life in the fire. Joseph deplored the fanatical strife in Ireland stoked in part by the Orange Order. He supported the alternative Protestant Benevolent Society of Ireland which was not anti-Catholic; thus he had little time for Lett, the Orangeman journalist.

As Clerk, he had to ensure administrative unity between the various city departments and maintain custody of all records, by-laws, deeds and leases of property, contracts and agreements and minutes of council and committee meetings. He co- signed with the Mayor on all deeds, agreements and contracts. He posted notices of Council meetings in the newspapers. He was guardian of the corporate seal and applied the oath of corporate office. As electoral officer, he managed voter registrations and elections. He prepared the tax ledgers and adjudicated tax claims. He was registrar of births, marriages and deaths. He managed the initial selector of jurors to be referred to the Crown Attorney.Brault, L.

City Clerks in 19th century colonial Canada controlled small, but powerful bureaucracies and were a well-networked community. In his poem Exchanging ComplimentsLett, W.P. Exchanging Compliments 8 January 1881, transcript at Cook, op. cit., pp. 275‚Äì278 and in a letter to the Kingston Daily News, Lett paid tribute to \\"my friend, Michael Flanagan, City Clerk of Kingston, Ontario on completion of his thirty-eighth year of official life\\" ... \\"the patriarch of our band\\".\\"Exchanging Compliments with Michael Flanagan\\", The Ottawa Daily Free Press, 8 January and Thursday 13 January 1881; and the Kingston Daily News, 8 January 1881. Lett held the power of the civic pen and had the ear of nineteen Mayors of Ottawa. According to his obituary in the Ottawa Evening Journal, he proved an indispensable civic speechwriter, \\"To speak of Mr. Lett's merits without mentioning his usefulness outside of his mere routine duties, and of his large-hearted liberality, where his sympathy was enlisted, would be regrettable. Many a Mayor, in the earlier days of the City, had reason to rejoice that one better educated and better qualified for literary work than the occupant of the Chair was at hand when the address, motion or memorial had to be penned. The City Clerk had read extensively and was possessed of a memory reliable to the last degree. Give him the subject to be spoken of and in half an hour the document would be produced that would stand the test of the refined and the educated. So well was this understood, that no anxiety was manifested as to the words to be used on any public occasion for the parchment was ready when required and met the occasion acceptably\\".\\"Death of W.P. Lett: After a Long Illness the Late City Clerk Fades Away\\", Ottawa Evening Journal, 16 August 1892. Lett co-signed with Mayor J. B Lewis, the address to Queen Victoria of 4 May 1857, prepared by R.

He likely wrote and he co-signed the address by Mayor Francis McDougal (1826 ‚Äì1910) on the return to Ottawa on 24 July 1885 of Captain Todd and the Ottawa Sharpshooters from their campaign during the North-West Rebellion.Reid, J. ed The Ottawa Sharpshooters paperback ‚Äì 2005, He drafted and co-signed all the documents of transmittal and subsequent resolutions to the Governor General and to both Houses of Parliament. These requested compensation for the tax-exempt status of Government facilities and activities in Ottawa and financial aid to expand City infrastructure to accommodate the newly located Legislature and the Offices of the Government and pay for the construction of permanent office buildings.Lett, W.

Fireworks and bonfires rounded out the evening in a tinder-box of a wood-framed City.

He assumed the additional duty of acting Clerk to the Police Court of the new City until his son William Pittman junior took over in 1881. On occasion, he undertook the hazardous job of accompanying prisoners to the Carleton County jail in Perth along the bush road where accomplices often sought to free them.\\"City Council ‚Äì Miscellaneous Expenditures\\", The Ottawa Times, Saturday 21 April 1866, vol. 1, No. 106, p. 2, col 5. Lett recognised the importance of having well-designed physical infrastructure to sustain a burgeoning Capital City. In 1871, he arranged for a fellow mason and subsequently his tenant, Arthur R. Sowdon to be hired away from his Deputy City Surveyor position in Montreal to the post of Ottawa City Engineer.Ottawa City Council, 31 May 1875, Motion Concerning Compensation to Mrs Sowdon, moved by Aldermen Rocque ans Pratte. Lett eventually attained such stature as a civic leader as to have had his short biography published with those of the mayor and city council in 1887 for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The accompanying commemorative photographic card shows Lett in pride-of-place, flanked by the Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald and Dominick Edward Blake, Leader of the Opposition Liberal Party, at the inverted apex of triangulation with the images of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and as the foundation supporting Mayor Stewart McLeod and City Hall.Mayor and Aldermen, City of Ottawa, Jubilee Photograph, 1837‚Äì1887, City of Ottawa Archives MG 037-11-427. Lett's close friendship with Prime Minister John A. Macdonald is evident from frequent personal correspondence.Cook, op. cit., pp. 55‚Äì56 and pp. 403‚Äì404. City Council capitalised on this when instructing Lett to prepare resolutions and arrange for delegations to meet with the Prime Minister and Government Committees. A resolution was passed on 6 December 1882 that a Special Committee should meet with the 'Premier of Canada' to create a capital city district similar to the District of Columbia, under the immediate control of the Government of the Dominion. Although this fell on deaf ears, it may be taken as the earliest suggestion for a National Capital Region.Lett, W. P.

The Bytown Mechanics' Institute was established in 1847 as a reading room for the professional class; Lett was a founder.Hirsch, R. F. The Bytown Mechanics' Institute: Improving the Mind of the Working Class, Bytown Pamphlet Series #39, 1992. p.6 It was replaced by the opening of the francophone Institute Canadien Fran√ßais d'Ottawa in 1852 and the anglophone Bytown Mechanics' Institute and Athenaeum (BMIA) on 29 January 1853. The BMIA hosted many local lectures, allowed female, Catholic and working class memberships, held picnics for wives and their families and curated a large newspaper and periodical library and local natural history museum. In 1856, the BMIA changed its name to the Ottawa Mechanics' Institute and Athenaeum (OMIA) to reflect the City's incorporation. The Ottawa City Directories of 1867 and 1870Canadian Directories Collection. list Lett as a trustee and the corresponding secretary. In 1868/9, the Ottawa Natural History Society, of which Lett was also a member, and the OMIA were merged by Provincial Act into the Ottawa Literary and Scientific Society.Gaizauskas, B. Feed the Flame: A Natural History of the Ottawa Literary and Scientific Society, M.A. thesis Carleton University, 1990, at Even the Institute Canadien Fran√ßais d'Ottawa recognised Lett's intellectual contributions with an honorary membership on 31 May 1886, despite his anti-Catholic past and little engagement in French Canadian literature.Lett, W.

He was guest speaker at society weddings.\\"The Address of Mr. W.P. Lett in Proposing the Health of a Bridal Pair (Mr. and Mrs. Maynard Rogers)\\" in the column \\"Married Life\\" of The Ottawa Evening Journal, 2 December 1886, vol. 1, issue 300, p. 2. His speech is described as \\"characteristically eloquent\\". He often used his sense of humor to convey an intellectual message, for example, spoofing the Ottawa Literary and Scientific Society in December 1876 with an extensive pseudo-scientific analysis of the rings of Saturn.Lett, W. P. The Rings of Saturn Explained December 1876, given to the Ottawa Literary & Scientific Society December 1876. He lampooned the Board of Trade and the etiquette of fancy balls.Lett, W.P.

Address Delivered at the Grand Opera House at the Annual Entertainment of the St. Patrick's Literary Association, 18 March 1878, p. 5. He exchanged poetry with the Countess.\\"Lament of the Irish Mother\\" by Lady Dufferin\\", The Historical Society of Ottawa News, issue 142, September 2013, p. 6. =Principles and morality= Lett was an opinionated man of high principles and morality, unafraid to speak his mind forcefully and directly. He frequently opposed slavery in his verse and prose.Lett, W.P. Open letter to the Editor Opposing Slavery, Ottawa Citizen, 29 January 1861 He was concerned that any revival of the movement to annexe Canada to the United States would reintroduce slavery into Canada, the destination to freedom for slaves using the Underground Railroad until abolition in 1865. In his Address to Brother Jonathan published in 1889,Lett, W. P. Annexation and British Connexion, Address to Brother Jonathan, Ottawa, Mason and Jones Printers, 48&50 Queen Street, 1889, 20pp. Lett publicly reprimanded the American President for not pursuing policies to \\"crush the aspirations of the South\\" and improve the conditions for former slaves after their \\"expedient emancipation\\". In that same Address, he declared his moral positions on many issues in a vitriolic exhortation to the President. \\"Abolish the free love of your infamous Divorce Court‚Ä¶make your laws supreme‚Ä¶banish the bowie knife and the revolver (carried as concealed weapons)‚Ä¶purify your judicial bench‚Ä¶reconstruct your election laws‚Ä¶keep your greenbacks out of the ballot-box‚Ä¶endeavor to get an honest expression of political opinion‚Ä¶and try a dose of national probity... if moral blood- poisoning has not enervated your system beyond redemption\\". His 1873 poem, Concealed Weapons,Lett, W.P. Concealed Weapons Ottawa Citizen, 12 December 1873, transcript at Cook, op. cit., p. 247-248. Lett set the context: Written on reading an account of a society recently formed in Augusta, Georgia, for the purpose of putting an end to the dangerous practice of carrying concealed weapons. His newspaper editor added the following footnote: The reader will draw the distinction between a defensive weapon under certain necessary and peculiar circumstances and the terribly dangerous and reprehensible practice of habitually carrying concealed and murderous offensive weapons argued for their banning in the wake of the assassinations of US presidents Lincoln and Garfield, and of Canadian politician and fellow poet, Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868,Lett, W. P. Poem \\"Thomas D'Arcy Mcgee\\", 30 December 1868, transcript at Cook, op.cit., pp. 300‚Äì304. allegedly by the Feniann sympathiser and Catholic, Patrick J. Whelan. He penned political satire in the Citizen newspaper under the pseudonym of Jeremiah O'Casey, writing from Washington, D.C. He was proud that Canada embraced the Constitution secured by the British Revolution of 1688 as the ideal model for governance, with a constitutional monarchy subject to law but retaining some political power; a mixed constitution between absolute monarchy and republican democracy.Lett, W.P. Poem Conservatism The Ottawa Times, 8 January 1866, transcript at Cook, op.cit., p.290-292 However, Lett stopped short of total emancipation, fearing that British Chartism might give all classes the vote and that the ignorant may vote for a rebellious cause.Lett, W.P. Poem For The Britons of '49 Bytown, 19 April 1849, transcript at Cook, op.cit., p. 284-286 Made President of the Ottawa Temperance Society in 1873, Lett gave rallying speeches including a strident address on The Enemies of King Alcohol: The Fight between Cold Water and Whiskey.Lett, W.P.

P. Hymn \\"Stretch Your Arm into the Darkness\\" to the tune of \\"Onward Christian Soldiers\\", 13 January 1872, transcript at Cook, op.cit., pp. 240‚Äì241. It would be going too far to suggest that Lett supported the nascent suffragette movement. He prefaced his poem WomanLett, W.P. Poem Woman 10 December 1848, transcribed in Cook, op.cit., pp. 220‚Äì222. with the widely-held opinion that a woman's God-given mission is to procreate and train her children for life on Earth and in Heaven. However, he supported a view that injustice is done to woman by public opinion, compared with its treatment of man, under precisely similar adverse circumstances‚Ä¶society did not require to be any more severe, any more uncharitable as respects women in this particular, but justice did call for similar treatment, to men, under like circumstances.Lett, W.P. Temperance Readings‚Ä¶.Good Programme and a Capital Evening's Fun _ Women's Rights etc newspaper clipping, in City of Ottawa Archives MG 037-8-1 He defined woman as \\"the 'summon bonum' of existence, without whom this earth would be a desert and life blank. Women have humanising and refining influence upon society, an influence stronger than physical force, more potent than law. Women ought to be first, not merely as a courtesy, but because women are the mothers of us all\\".Lett, W. P. \\"An Address on 'Woman'\\" given at the Duke Street School House, Entertainment in Aid of the Poor, 30 January 1877, found at City of Ottawa Archives MG 037-8-1, p. 57. Lett was charitable towards those who he felt deserving. In his 1847 poem, The Famine, he called for international aid to the starving of the Great Famine of Ireland (1845‚Äì1852).Lett, W. P. The Famine Bytown, 27 March 1847. In his poetry he had little pity for The Deserter but, in 1880, urged forgiveness for a ninety- five-year Old Soldier of the Napoleonic wars who was being punished for vagrancy.Transcripts at Cook, op.cit., \\"The Deserter\\" pp. 154‚Äì155, \\"The Old Soldier\\", pp. 197‚Äì198. =Patriot= Lett was an avowed patriot of the British mother countries of England, Ireland and Scotland. His poetry is filled with accounts of British heroism, the glories and defence of the Empire and British cultural and engineering supremacy. Queen Victoria, her consort, her children and her vice-regal Canadian Governors' General are praised. He lambasts domestic and British politicians who challenged Throne or whose trade or foreign policies, such as those of William Ewart Gladstone, threatened Canada's economic or social security. He attacks political and provincial opponents of Confederation. The British Connexion had to be maintained at all costs. He campaigned in prose and verse to retain the Union Jack during the national flag debate that followed the signing of Confederation.Lett, W. P. Poetry on \\"Homelands\\", \\"Loyalty, Royalty and the Flag\\" and \\"Imperial Wars and Warriors\\", transcriptions at Cook, op.cit., pp. 144‚Äì199. Lett could read of global news in the foreign dispatches of the newspapers. He was concerned about the defence of the British Empire especially in India and Africa, and the shifting balance of power in Europe. His poetry in the same newspapers reflects his fear of Russian and more particularly Prussic-German imperial ambitions for Europe and the world, believing prophetically that, in the long run, not even the Americas would be immune. He laments the fate of Poland and even that of France after the calamitous siege of Paris in 1871. He warns America not to fuel these conflicts through international trading in guns and munitions. He keeps a wary eye on the republican experiments in Europe and North and South America, fearing that Canada might deviate from a path towards a monarchical confederated constitution grounded in British law and emulating British parliamentary structure and process.Lett, W. P. Poetry on Imperial Wars and Warriors particularly \\"Fame\\" and \\"Consequential Damages\\", transcriptions at Cook, op.cit., pp. 175‚Äì199. Lett's previously mentioned 1889 Address to Brother Jonathan, Annexation and the British Connection is an aggressive, twenty-page polemic on Canadian independence and patriotism. In the Address, he characterises Americans as having been \\"led astray by incorrect information‚Ä¶and with supreme self-possession, you smoke your cigar, you think of the 'Monroe doctrine', and ponder over the visionary dream that Canada will yet form a part of your country\\". He bluntly tells America to leave Canada to prosper under a system of government connected to the British monarchy and preferable to republicanism. He challenges America to stop its diplomatic and military belligerence toward Canada, and ends with a version of his patriotic poem of passionate loyalty to the British Connexion.Lett, W. P., Annexation and British Connexion, Address to Brother Jonathan, Ottawa: Mason and Jones Printers, 48 & 50 Queen Street, 1889, 20pp. Transcriptions of several versions of the poem \\"British Connexion\\" at Cook, pp. 304‚Äì309. Until his death in 1892, Lett opposed any traitorous hint of annexation, even after the debate had shifted to trade reciprocity or stronger commercial union. Around 1891, an old and terminally ill Lett still had the conviction to pen a damning indictment of the Canadian politicians Sir Richard Cartwright and Solomon White, and journalist Erastus Wiman for their support of free trade by reciprocity and for rekindling the old Canada Annexation Debate of the mid-19th century: they are the badger, muskrat and skunk making treasonable misrepresentations to allure Canadians from their allegiance and supporting the bald headed eagle, the unfortunately selected emblem in the Yankee Escutcheon, [to be] the plundering harpy who wants to rob the Canadian Osprey of his dinner.Lett, W. P. Political Commentary ca.1891, roughly typed manuscript, City of Ottawa Archives MG 037-4-192.'' =Chronicler= Lett chronicled the evolution of Bytown and Ottawa throughout his life. He published his only collection of poetry, Recollections of Bytown and Its Old Inhabitants in 1874.Lett, W. P. Recollections of Old Bytown and Its Inhabitants, Ottawa, Citizen Printing and Publishing Co., 1874, 112pp., https://archive.org/stream/recollectionsofb14908gut/14908.txt reproduced by The Historical Society of Ottawa in Lett's Bytown, Bytown Series # 3,1979, Edwin Welch (ed.). The Recollections are a series of extended poems mostly in rhyming couplet form describing Bytown's notable residents, their locations, characters and occupations, portrayed on a detailed historical and geographic canvas. Much of Lett's other poetry details significant local events and personalities. Lett gave at least three \\"carrier addresses\\" in verse, one to the Orangemen published in the Orange Lily in 1850,Lett, W.P. \\"New-Year's Address To The Readers Of The Orange Lily\\", Bytown, 1 January 1850, published front page of The Orange Lily and Protestant Vindicator vol.1, #13 one as a poem for 1859/60 \\"To The Patrons of the Union (Hotel)\\", and one for 1871/72.

Sportsman thumbWilliam Pittman Lett with Shot Gun and Hound, ca.1865 (E. Spencer / City of Ottawa Archives) Lett was an enthusiastic sportsman. He shot birds, fished from his birch-bark canoe, and camped out on yearly deer hunting expeditions with his personal hounds and a band of close friends including the Iroquois hunter, Eustache.Lett W.P..

His was a nature born to love nature, and no boy was happier than he when he could leave the haunts of men and seek the solitudes along the banks of the Ottawa and Gatineau Rivers or minor streams and 'haul the silvery shining prey from the whirling eddy's spray'. As a huntsman in the early days of Bytown, he was acquainted with every nook and corner of Carleton, Russell and Ottawa counties and he admits in his own writings that it would have been well for him had he devoted less time to such pursuits. To the last days, when he was hardly able to make his way to his desk at city hall, he would long to get away into the silence of the woods or beside the stream for a quiet fishing expedition.\\"Obituary Ex- City Clerk W.P. Lett\\", 1892 newspaper clipping, Lett Scrapbook, City of Ottawa Archives MG 037-8-1. It is therefore understandable that Lett related to the aboriginal belief in the spiritual hierarchy of Manitou and wrote an article on the spirits of the Manitou Rapids on the Gatineau River.Lett, W.

There was no Ottawa Hunt Club in the 19th century, so formal hunts involving the highest in society were organised as the occasion warranted. In 1870, one such hunt was organised for Prince Arthur during his visit to Ottawa and tour of Canada; Lett controlled the deer runway where Governor General Lord Lisgar was shooting.The Canadian illustrated News: [Vol. 1, no. 13 (29 January 1870)] Montreal : G.

As an avid hunter and patriotic armchair warrior, Lett was well versed in cannon and guns. He often alluded to progress in efficiency, accuracy and distance brought by technological advancements from muzzle to breach loading and the internal rifling of barrels. He sketched a history of military weaponry in his poem The SniderCook, transcript at pp. 184-186. and often praised the virtues of that British army-issue rifle in defence of the Empire. He authored under his pen name Algonquin, a 30-page history of his sporting life and the evolution of guns: From the Flintlock to the Hammerless.Lett, W.

Lett, by then 62 years old, dove in fully clothed and grappled with the panicking youth in a dangerous current close to the stern of a flat-bottomed barge. When they surfaced, a bargeman hauled them on to a boat before they were sucked beneath the barge. Newspaper headlines declared Narrow Escape From Drowning; Gallant Rescue by our City Clerk ‚Äì The Latter Nearly Meets a Watery Grave and Lett was awarded the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society on 18 July 1881. Later life and death =Widower= Lett's wife, Maria Hinton, was killed on Saturday, 3 September 1881, a month shy of fifty-three years old. The rear boxcar of a train of the St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway (SL&OR;) struck her phaeton while it was being driven northwards across the tracks at the intersection of Ottawa's Dalhousie and McTaggart Streets adjacent to the company's freight sheds and passenger depot. Lett won his case against the SL&OR; for negligence. He was awarded damages of $5,800, of which $1,500 was apportioned to himself and the balance divided among the children. The SL&OR; was subsequently taken over by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The Supreme Court, on a split decision, dismissed the appeal of the CPR with costs: \\"Although, on the death of a wife caused by negligence of a railway company, the husband cannot recover damages of a sentimental character, yet the loss of household services accustomed to be performed by the wife, which would have to be replaced by hired services, is a substantial loss for which damages may be recovered, as is also the loss to the children of the care and moral training of their mother. (Taschereau and Gwynne dissenting)\\".\\"St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway Co. v. Lett\\", Supreme Court of Canada Record 422, 16 November 1885 . Her death was a devastating loss for William and their children. He kept two small photographs to remind him of Maria inscribed with the same words written on 12 November 1882: \\"Silent in death, She speaketh still, I hear her voice, I feel her hand Greeting me in the upward path Which leads me to the Spirit Land, And O! my heart's incessant prayer Is that I yet may meet her there.\\"Cook, op.cit., transcripts at pp. 87 and 336. =Retirement= An ageing Lett of 65 years was tiring of his City Clerkship and applied in 1884 to become Librarian to the Parliament of Canada following the death on 22 January 1884 of the incumbent, Dr. Alpheus Todd (1821‚Äì1884). Prime Minister Macdonald did not reply.Lett, W. P. Dominion librarianship application, 25 January 1884, Sir John A. Macdonald papers, Volume 7, #2052‚Äì3 Library and Archives Canada.

A postmortem was conducted as his long sickness has not been fully understood by his medical advisors. It proved to be metastasized cancer of the spine. By order of the City Treasurer, Thomas Halder Kirby, the City Hall flag flew at half-mast; officials ordered a floral tribute; and Council unanimously approved a resolution of honour and a motion for a fully paid public funeral in recognition of his long and faithful services.The Last Honors, Special Resolution of Ottawa City Council, 1892. Lett's funeral cortege with a four-horse hearse was one of the largest ever seen in Ottawa, and included some of the oldest and most prominent citizens. It proceeded past closed stores along Ottawa's Sussex and Sparks Streets to the Dominion Methodist Church. He was buried beside his beloved Maria on Wednesday, 17 August 1892 at Ottawa's Beechwood Cemetery, sharing a monument with the Hinton and Grant relatives. Lett was a household name during his life and it became a source of pride for Ottawans to claim that their loved ones were immortalised in his works. Lett Street is a short residual street on Ottawa's LeBreton Flats. His grave is obscure and the monument almost indiscernible by the weathering of time. It is a poor tribute to one who had contributed so much to the heritage of Canada's capital. Bard In all but title, Lett was Ottawa's first poet laureate producing some two hundred and twenty-two poems and songs in his lifetime not including the many snippets of verse with which he habitually embellished his public speeches. His poetry provides a poetic editorial on many personalities and events in Canada's 19th century. His topics include: affection and romance; religion; homelands; loyalty, royalty and the flag; imperial wars and warriors; sporting life; social commentary; Bytown to Ottawa; colony to nation; bereavement, grieving and solace; reflections; and poets, poetry and songsters. They are full of the religious and political fire-and-brimstone rhetoric of the time. One hundred and two were published in the newspapers or presented to an audience.Cook, transcripts and historical contexts at pp. 100‚Äì388. In addition to newspaper publication and invited addresses to associations and society events, Lett orchestrated public recitals of traditional poetry, his favourite poets and his own works.Lett, W. P. \\"Selections from the Standard Poets\\", English Church Readings, Gowan's Hall, Friday 9 April 1870, The Ottawa Times, 18 April 1870. In his 1878 \\"Address to the Annual Entertainment of the St. Patrick's Literary Association\\",Lett, W. P. Address Delivered at the Grand Opera House: at the Annual Entertainment of the St. Patrick's Literary Association, 18 March 1878, p. 5. he saluted the \\"genius and immortality\\" of a long list of \\"statesmen, sages, warriors, philosophers, orators and poets\\" who had influenced his writing. His greatest influences were Burns, Walter Scott, Byron, Victor Hugo \\"that Moses of the modern gospel of Freedom, Humanity and Romance\\" and his favourite, the Irish bard Thomas Moore . However, contemporary anthologists were not impressed. Mrs. C.M. Whyte-Edgar, in her Wreath of Canadian Song published in 1910,Whyte-Edgar, Mrs. C.M. A Wreath of Canadian Song, Toronto, W. Briggs, 1910, 283pp listed Lett \\"among others, writing since the middle of the last century, [who] won, in some cases, more than local attention\\". His short biography was included by C. C. James in A Bibliography of Canadian Poetry, published in 1899.James, C. C. A Bibliography of Canadian Poetry, Toronto, W. Briggs, 1899. One of his poems, \\"Call Me by My Christian Name\\", was included in E. H. Dewart's 1864 Selections of Canadian Poets.Dewart, E. H. Selections of Canadian Poets, Montreal: J. Lovell, 1864 (304pp), pp. 260‚Äì261. Lett was too busy to take the time to publish an anthology of his own poetry other than his Recollections and the \\"British Connexion\\". The former, written in near doggerel cemented his obscurity in Canadian literary history. His archived papers show evidence that a personally selected anthology was in the works. If it had been carefully edited and published, he may well have gained a better recognition in the Canadian poetic canon. William Pittman Lett is, nevertheless, an important poet in the Canadian Victorian tradition, \\"blogging\\" in verse the rise of Bytown to Ottawa and the evolution of the colony to nationhood, all in context of his own tumultuous and eclectic life and the international turmoil of the nineteenth century. He was a true Confederation poet, bridging the 19th century to the poetic innovations of the popularly named Confederation School of poets.

It was Gilbert's 29th novel and the second of three featuring his final set of recurring characters, Luke Pagan and Joe Narrabone. Set near the beginning of World War I, it has, along with its fictional characters and situations, references to actual events of the time, and a number of actual historical personages also play roles in the book. Gilbert, who was appointed CBE in 1980, was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers' Association. The Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master in 1988 and in 1990 he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award. Plot Unusually for Gilbert, only about one third of the book's events take place in his usual locale of London. The book, which is really three related stories around a single theme, is set first in the great British naval base of Portsmouth, then in London, and then for the final third in war-torn France. Luke Pagan, formerly a London policeman and now a young recruit in MO5, the new intelligence service headed by Vernon Kell, is an undercover agent posing as a waiter in a Portsmouth hotel. Elements of the German fleet are in port, and he hopes to gain information about German plans for what most observers believe to be an impending war. His old friend Joe Narrabone, also a former London policeman, has been sent to Portsmouth to assist him. In his guise as a waiter, Luke encounters Erich Krieger, a wily and ruthless German saboteur-intelligence agent now passing as a haughty British major residing in Portsmouth. Pagan and Narrabone unravel the details of Krieger's ingenious espionage, but Krieger escapes before he can be arrested. The second part of the book shifts to London, where Krieger has assumed another identity in the first days of the war and is contributing to the deadly sabotage of British warships. With help from Vernon Kell and Admiral William (Blinker) Hall, soon to be the real-life head of Naval Intelligence, they once again thwart some of Krieger's schemes, rounding up a number of German agents in the process. But, as before, Krieger succeeds in escaping. On the assumption that Krieger is still posing as an English officer, but now in France somewhere near the front lines, Luke and Joe are sent to an important transit camp for British troops near the coastal resort of Le Touquet in northern France to continue their pursuit. Working with both British officers and French villagers and fishermen, Pagan and Narrabone use their usual unorthodox methods to eventually track down Krieger in a series of caverns, where he is leading a sizeable group of British deserters. With lethal help from a vengeful French teenager, they bring their hunt, and the book, to an explosive conclusion.

Located on the corner of Congress Avenue and Sixth Street, the Chicago- style building was originally home to the flagship E.M. Scarbrough & Sons department store. The building was the first steel-framed high-rise in Austin. In 1931, a renovation introduced Art Deco elements to the building; the renovation also made Scarbrough's the first retailer to have air conditioning (‚Äúmanufactured weather‚Äù) west of the Mississippi River. The building was named a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 2001.12733 History The building was originally built starting in 1908 by Emerson Monroe Scarbrough, Sr., a former Confederate soldier, to house the flagship location for E.M. Scarbrough & Sons department store, which was known as Scarbrough's by locals. The store originally opened in 1874 in Rockdale, Texas under the name Scarbrough & Hicks. In 1893 Scarbrough left R.H. Hicks in charge of the store and moved with his family to Austin, expanding the business to a new location in the Kreisle Building at the 400 block of Congress Avenue. In 1905, Scarbrough hired architects Sanguinet & Staats to design a new building for the department store. When the new building was completed in 1909, it was the tallest in the state, but George W. Littlefield added a ninth story to his new building to steal the title a year later. In an era where goods were bargained, Scarbrough's was a pioneer in price tagging every item in the store. E.M. Scarbrough bought out and renamed the business with his sons, J. William and Lemuel Scarbrough, in 1913. In 1931, the Scarbrough sons hired architects Wyatt C. Hedrick and Edwin C. Kreisle for a renovation of the building. The Scarbrough Building was completely remodeled in an Art Deco facade, with shop windows widened from 6 ft. (2 m). In its heyday, the department store occupied 95,000 sq. ft. (8,800 m2) spanning three stories, including 10 departments on the ground floor alone. Growth after World War II would redefine shopping habits among the city's new residents. In the 1970s, a branch store was opened at Highland Mall. In 1981, a Scarbrough's store opened as an anchor at Barton Creek Square. The struggling downtown store closed its doors in 1982 after dismal Christmas season sales. The last remaining Scarbrough's store, located on North Lamar Boulevard, closed its doors in December 2009. After Scarbrough's department store closed, the building's ground floor and basement were home to numerous retail stores, including Brooks Brothers and Gold's Gym. In 2019, it was announced that Punch Bowl Social, an entertainment venue, signed a lease for the ground floor and basement level of the building.

This subtitle indicates the shared theme of the stories: the modern corporate workplace and its effect on those who sustain it at the lower levels. The narrators of the first two stories are relatively low-level employees of large corporations with inner-city offices. Stories =\\"My Work Is Not Yet Done\\"= Constantly afraid, Frank Dominio is a junior manager in a company which doesn't respect him. He's routinely called to meetings by what he calls \\"The Seven\\": seven other managers led by Richard, nicknamed \\"The Doctor\\" for dark and mysterious reasons that an employee could lose their job for enquiring about. Richard calls Dominio \\"Domino\\" in what the latter believes is a deliberate mistake made as a power play. The other managers are Barry, Harry, Mary, Perry, Sherry, and Kerrie, their similarities of name leading Dominio to think of them, Richard aside, as the Seven Dwarves. When Dominio proposes a new product idea which could bring in a great deal of money, The Seven conspire to have him demoted then fired so they can steal it for themselves. A depressed Dominio visits a gun shop, planning to return to the company the next day and kill them one by one. However, as he's preparing for this, a strange, dark force operating within and behind the scenes of life envelops him, putting him in a psychic position between life and death, where he can spy on The Seven while using supernatural powers to craft ironic punishments for them. =\\"I Have a Special Plan for This World\\"= Blaine Company moves to a city once known as Murder Town for its high crime rate, but since a re-branding effort has been designated the Golden City.

Life Blair was born in Ireland in 1720 to William Blair. He immigrated to the colonies in his youth. He was educated in under Reverend William Tennent at the Log College, the first theological seminary serving Presbyterians in North America located in what is now Warminster, Pennsylvania (then known as Neshaminy). He later received a M.A. from the College of New Jersey in 1760. He was licensed to preach by the New Side Presbytery of Newcastle. He was ordained December 27, 1742 as pastor of the Hopewell Church at Big Spring in Newville, the Rocky Spring Presbyterian Church in Letterkenny, and at Middle Spring Presbyterian Church in Southampton Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania until December 1748. The towns and churches were abandoned due to Indian conflict during the Indian Wars. He then moved to Londonderry Township where his brother, Samuel Blair had founded the Faggs Manor Presbyterian church and associated classical school. He remained there after his brother's 1751 death and became pastor, and head of the school, until 1767. He then moved to Princeton, New Jersey where the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) was located to accept a position of Professor of Theology that was funded by a bequeath of Rev Samuel Finley who died in 1767. He was also appointed Trustee, Vice-President, and acting president until appointed President John Witherspoon was able to arrive. As the funds to support the Professorship were insufficient, and Witherspoon was able to teach and lead the college, it was agreed that Blair would resign as Professor.

She participated in the art projects for the New Deal's Section of Painting and Sculpture creating the post office mural for Newton, Mississippi, and a collection of her watercolors was held at the Carville Marine Hospital. Early life Mary Ross was born on July 3, 1920, in St. Johnsbury, Vermont to Dorothy (n√©e Ashley) and Ralph Ross. She was the granddaughter of Dr. George H. Ashley of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Boggs studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Career Prior to her marriage, Ross had begun working as one of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) artists and had won a commission. She married Franklin Boggs on December 21, 1940, in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, and the couple subsequently had four children. In 1941, she and Franklin, who were living in Knoxville, Tennessee, won the competition to complete \\"Economic Life in Newton in the Early 1940s\\" for the post office mural in Newton, Mississippi. The painting was completed as an oil on canvas and then applied to the post office wall. That same year, her watercolor \\"Children's Sunday\\" was selected for an exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art. After the WPA program ended, the couple moved to Wisconsin, where by 1958, Franklin was the chair of the Art department at Beloit College. The Wright Museum of Art there houses her Judy and Summer (1951). Boggs taught art classes for the Beloit Art League and traveled extensively throughout Argentina and Mexico. She exhibited works in Philadelphia, Beloit, Milwaukee, Knoxville and Washington D.C. A collection of Bogg's watercolors were held by the Carville Marine Hospital in Carville, Louisiana, and she had works held in private collections. Boggs divorced Franklin in 1958 and later married Hugh Townley, who had left Beloit for Boston University. She changed her professional name to Mary Ross Townley and began publishing art textbooks. A review of Another Look!, a 1978 curriculum- kit of art textbooks for younger children and their teachers, gives some insight into Mary Ross Townley's concern with imparting the fundamentals of art and the development of visual awareness by a structured, sequenced programme of work, building on itself. In 1989, when her husband retired from Brown University, they moved to Bethel, Vermont. Death and legacy Townley died on June 4, 2002, in Bethel, Vermont.

It also claimed a violation of TFEU art 63 on free movement of capital. Under Dutch law there was (1) a prohibition on privatisation of shares in electricity or gas distribution system operators, all of which had to be public, and (2) a group prohibition, so that system operators must not be part of the same group as companies that generate, supply or trade electricity, and (3) a prohibition on members of a group burdening themselves with debts and other things that ‚Äòmay adversely affect system operation‚Äô. The Dutch government argued all measures fell within the protection of TFEU art 345, that member states can determine rules ‚Äògoverning the system of property ownership‚Äô.

Not much is known about the Southern California legless lizard as a separate species, with most observations conducted while it was not recognised as separate from Anniella pulchra. Etymology The specific name stebbinsi honors Robert C. Stebbins, an American herpetologist.  Description  The Southern California legless lizard is small and slender, with no legs, a shovel-shaped snout, smooth shiny scales, and a blunt tail. On close observation, eyelids are also present, making clear that the species are lizards and not snakes. Its dorsum is light olive-brown, with strong yellow sides, and its ventral colour is moderate yellow. It also has a black mid-dorsal stripe with the length of less than one scale wide that stretches from the parietals to the tip of the tail, and multiple black stripes that are one scale wide from the eye to the tip of the tail. The holotype is adult female measuring in snout‚Äìvent length with regenerated tail.  Distribution  This species is found in southern California (USA) and northern Baja California (Mexico).  Habitat and conservation  The Southern California legless lizard is found in a wider range of habitat than any other species in the genus, mostly found in coastal sand dunes and a variety of interior habitats, including sandy washes and alluvial fans. They live mostly underground, burrowing in the loose, sandy soil. However, much of the coastal dune habitat has been destroyed by coastal development between Ventura County and the Mexican Border. However, a large protected population persists in the remnant of the once extensive El Segundo Dunes at the Los Angeles International Airport. As of March 2017, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not assessed this species for the IUCN Red List.

One of New York's last remaining Yiddish theatre buildings, it is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally named the Louis N. Jaffe Theater (also called the Yiddish Art Theatre (after its first tenant) and later the Yiddish Folks Theatre), the structure was built in 1925-26 by Louis Jaffe, a developer and prominent Jewish community leader, at 12th Street and Second Avenue in the Yiddish Theatre District. Jaffe built the theatre to house Maurice Schwartz's Yiddish Art Theatre, which Schwartz had founded 1918 to present serious Yiddish drama and works from world literature in Yiddish. The theatre was designed in the Moorish Revival style by Harrison Wiseman; William Pogany consulted on the interior design. The design incorporated Moorish motifs with Judaic references (Yiddish writing outside the lobby and a large Star of David in the ornate dome remain to attest to the building's origins). In his new theatre, Schwartz continued to produce shows, including a production of \\"Yoshe Kalb\\" which ran for 300 performances. According to legend, Walter Matthau briefly worked at the theatre's concession stand as a youth. The Yiddish Arts Theatre continued at least into 1936, but by the late 1930s the building was a movie theatre, the Century Theatre. It closed for a while in the 1940s, reopening as a 1,082-seat movie theatre, the Stuyvesant Theatre. Around 1953 Norris Houghton and Edward Hambleton bought the theatre (which was then closed) and renamed it the Phoenix Theatre. The Phoenix Theatre was a pioneering project in the development of off-Broadway, with a different approach to legitimate theatre than found on Broadway. The first production was Sidney Howard's play \\"Madam, Will You Walk?\\", which opened on December 1, 1953, starring Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy; later that season Montgomery Clift starred in The Seagull. In the following years, the Phoenix Theatre mounted more productions featuring notable figures of the theatre both on stage and behind it. The Phoenix Theatre moved to a new location in 1961. Ann Corio then mounted her successful nostalgic review This Was Burlesque at the theatre, beginning in 1962. Corio later took her show on the road. From 1965 to 1969, the building was the Gayety Theatre, a more raunchy burlesque house, and the only one in Manhattan at that time. The Gayety Theatre was used for the interior theatre shots in the film The Night They Raided Minsky's. After this, the theatre operated as the Eden Theatre and hosted off-Broadway shows, including Grease and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat before those musicals went on to Broadway, and the controversial Oh! Calcutta!. From 1978 to 1984 the theatre operated as the Entermedia Theater. In 1991 the theatre (which was no longer in use) was converted back to a movie theatre, the Village East Cinema (owned by City Cinemas, a branch of Reading International), which shows a mixture of Hollywood productions and indie films. The main auditorium seats 1,200, and there are four small screening rooms in the basement, each seating under 200 people, and two other screens in the former backstage area. The Village East Cinema also shows films which originally opened at the Angelika Film Center, an arthouse chain which is also an arm of Reading International. The theatre was extensively renovated and restored in 2015.

She played an important political part: she had contacts within the government, expanded the abbey and its importance considerably and made it into an asylum (1544) where a great deal of religious dissidents were given protection, as well as being a religious and charitable center. During the great Iconoclasm of 1566, the Calvinist Caspar van der Heyden held a speech outside the convent gates the 24 August, after which the abbey was attacked. The nuns themselves were not molested but given save passage, but the abbey was given such damage that it could not be restored for a year.

He attended the University of Utah and UCLA. While in college, he sold encyclopedias. Book distribution and publishing business in Japan A romance with a Japanese woman led him to visit Japan. He stayed 13 years, establishing a book distribution company that sold English language encyclopedias, engineering books and art books. His company also published translations of books into Japanese. Shrem sold his Japanese business after 13 years. At that time, it had 50 offices and 2,000 salespeople. He met Mitsuko Shrem in 1960; they married and had two sons, Marc and David. They were married until her death from pancreatic cancer in 2010.

Tom Shull is an American businessman and Director/CEO of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service (Exchange), No. 61 on the National Retail Federation's Top 100 Retailers list. Shull joined the Exchange in 2012 as the first civilian to lead the Department of Defense's largest retailer. He also serves on the Exchange's Board of Directors.  Early life and education  Shull was born at Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Aurora, Colo., while his father was on joint assignment at Peterson Air Force Base. His father served for 30 years in the United States Army and spent more than 40 months in combat. Shull is a graduate of Heidelberg High School in Heidelberg, Germany.

Shull earned several honors, including the Meritorious Service Medal, Expert Infantryman‚Äôs Badge, Ranger Tab and Airborne Wings. In 1981, Shull was named to the 17th class of White House Fellows and served in the Office of the Chief of Staff. During his last active-duty assignment, then-Major Shull served as Military Assistant to Robert ‚ÄúBud‚Äù McFarlane, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. During his time at the White House, Shull led a major re-evaluation and revision of White House management systems. He also conducted a comprehensive review of the National Security Council, was a Term Member of the Council on Foreign Relations and helped coordinate National Security Council low-intensity conflict policy initiatives. Shull represented the White House in helping to oversee the construction and dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He earned the Defense Superior Service Medal.  Business career  Shull began his retail career in 1985 at Sanger-Harris, formed by Federated Department Stores, in Dallas, Texas, where he led business planning, training and recruiting. He served as Divisional Merchandise Manager of $20 million hard good businesses for the prominent regional 22-store chain. From 1986 to 1990, Shull served as senior consultant at McKinsey & Co., where he directed defense/aerospace and retail client engagements to reduce costs and increase market share. In 1990, Shull co-founded Meridian Ventures and served as CEO until 2012. He served clients including Federated Department Stores, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, Mobil Corp., Tecstar Corp. and Spiegel Brands as senior adviser and assumed senior executive roles to identify acquisitions, raise equity capital and implement turnarounds.

From 2000 to 2004, Shull served as president and chief executive of Hanover Direct. At Hanover, profitability improved by more than $45 million on a $460 million sales base as he repositioned the company‚Äôs e-commerce business and increased sales from $20 million to more than $125 million. Shull led efforts to save brands such as The Company Store, Gump‚Äôs and Improvements. In 2004, Shull joined Wise Foods as chairman and chief executive officer. He increased earnings by 10 percentage points and positioned the company for sale after a successful turnaround. He served until 2008. Shull was elected to the Zale Corporation Board of Directors from 2004 to 2010, serving on the Compensation Committee and as Chairman of the Audit Committee for three years. As Audit Committee Chair, he successfully resolved two SEC investigations and led improvements in governance and accounting practices through early adoption of Sarbanes-Oxley requirements. In 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York named Shull the chief restructuring officer of Fred Leighton Jewelers. The Exchange is responsible for more than 2,500 facilities in 33 countries, 50 states, five U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa) and the District of Columbia. In 2012, Shull was named the Director/CEO of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service, becoming the first civilian to lead the Department of Defense retailer. Shull‚Äôs business acumen and passion for taking care of military families have been the foundation to keeping the Exchange benefit thriving for America‚Äôs Warfighters and their families. When he came aboard, Shull applied private-sector best practices to the Exchange and focused on growth initiatives such as intensifying national brands, growing concessions and its convenience stores, transforming the online experience. The Exchange is a nonappropriated fund entity of the Department of Defense operating more than 4,000 retail facilities in more than 30 countries. Like commercial retailers, the Exchange is reliant on the sale of products and services to fund its operations and generate a profit. In 2015, the Exchange achieved more than $400 million in earnings, despite military personnel downsizing of 13 percent since 2011. This performance represents an increase of three percentage points in terms of profitability, and is on par with or exceeds that of Walmart and Target. Record operating earnings in 2015 allowed the Exchange to distribute $237.2 million in dividends to military Quality-of-Life Programs. Each year, the Exchange distributes two-thirds of its earnings to these programs. In 2016, Shull became the longest-serving leader of the Exchange. Under Shull's leadership, the Exchange has more closely aligned itself with private-sector competitors by tightening cost controls, reducing its number of employees, and introducing top brands such as Disney and Michael Kors. The Exchange has also improved its E-commerce operation at ShopMyExchange.com, establishing shipping centers inside brick-and-mortar stores to reduce shipping costs and increase delivery speeds. In 2019, the Exchange continued to perform well, reporting $369 million in earnings, $217 million of which was reinvested into installation Quality-of-Life programs that promote military readiness and resiliency, including child, youth and school services; Armed Forces Recreation Centers; and more. Shull is a former member of the Board of Trustees of the Association of Graduates of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He also helped lead the first major Capital Campaign in USMA history. Shull is former Chairman and member of the Board of Directors, Deafness Research Foundation, the largest private charity for funding research in the causes and treatment of hearing loss.  Veterans advocacy  thumb Tom Shull (second from left) with (left to right) Michael Zacharia, Ambassador Robert \\"Bud\\" McFarlane, Lewis Shull, \\"To Heal a Nation\\" author Jan Scruggs and LTC John Shull. Shull is a lifelong advocate for veterans' issues. While serving as a White House Fellow assigned to the White House, Shull was chosen to be an intermediary during the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, helping to ensure compromises were reached to facilitate the construction and dedication of the memorial. In a Harvard Business School Bulletin article \\"Making Peace,\\" Jack Wheeler (a driving force in getting the Memorial built on the National Mall) said, \\"There would have been no memorial without Tom Shull. Period.\\" Once Shull came to the Exchange, he began planning for a way to recognize and honor all honorably discharged veterans for their service. In a 2014 memo to the Undersecretary of Defense, Shull proposed allowing all honorably discharged veterans to shop the exchanges online as a modest recognition of their service, especially since the vast majority of veterans who served honorably do not meet the 20-year criteria or certified 100% disabled by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to retain exchange benefits. The Veterans online shopping benefit represents a low-risk, low-cost opportunity to strengthen funding of Quality-of-Life programs in support of service members‚Äô and their families. On Jan. 11, 2017, after years of coordination with the Exchange, Departments of Defense, Army and Air Force as well as several other federal agencies, Shull received word that a change to DoD policy would extend limited online exchange privileges to all honorably discharged veterans starting Nov. 11, 2017‚ÄîVeterans Day. Congressional oversight committees were notified as well and had 30 days to comment. No comments were provided, and the Veterans online shopping benefit‚Äîthe first new benefit for Veterans since 1953‚Äîbegan on Veterans Day 2017. The Veterans online shopping benefit allows approximately 15 million veterans to shop online at military exchanges. As of June 2019, nearly 90,000 Veterans saved more than $5 million in sales tax . The initiative is projected to add approximately $200 million in sales to the Exchange's annual revenue within three years, making the Exchange more competitive with private-sector competitors such as Amazon.com and offsetting a 13 percent decline in the number of active-duty Soldiers and Airmen since 2011. On Jan. 1, 2020, the Exchange welcomed home disabled Veterans, Purple Heart recipients and certain caregivers‚Äî4.1 million Americans‚Äî with in-store shopping privileges. Privileges expanded to all Veterans with service-connected disabilities, Veterans who are Purple Heart recipients, Veterans who are former prisoners of war and primary family caregivers for Veterans who are enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. Before the expansion, only Veterans with 100% service-connected disabilities could shop in person. (Active-duty service members, their dependents and military retirees also have in-store and online privileges.)  Awards and Decorations  Mr. Shull's awards and decorations include: * Presidential Service Badge * Meritorious Service Medal (United States) * Expert Infantryman‚Äôs Badge * Ranger Tab * Airborne Wings * Defense Superior Service Medal. * Reserve Officer's Association's Minuteman Hall of Fame * American Logistics Association Distinguished Service Award  Personal life  Shull and his wife, Dorothy, reside in Dallas, TX.

Natural environment  Polna is located at the border between Ro≈ºnow-Ciƒô≈ºkowice Foothill and Low Beskid mountain range. From the hills of Polna a vast panorama can be seen.

In the forest of Polna, at one of the trails to Ma≈õlana G√≥ra, the St John‚Äôs Spring can be found. It is believed by some that the water from the spring heals eye diseases.  Education  There is a primary education school in Polna: http://szppolna.republika.pl  Historical architecture  =The Church of St Andrew the Apostle, Polna= The history of Polna parish dates back to the second half of the 14th century. The Church of St. Andrew the Apostle was erected in place of the older temple which was founded in 1297 by Ritter Wizlans of Melsztyn, as mentioned by the 15th century chronicler, Jan Dlugosz, in his work \\"Liber beneficiorum\\". The construction of the present church took place in the 16th century. The church is in the late Gothic style; there is one main nave with a chancel and an apse, ending with a three-sided tower. In 1820 the church was significantly rebuilt, thanks to the efforts of the owner of the village, Tekla Stadnicka, and the front of the nave from the west was extended. Following this, in 1901 a new bell tower was built, in 1910 the rectory building was added, and between 1920 and 1939, the new farm buildings were constructed. In the years 2001‚Äì2010 numerous conservation work was carried out, including the restoration of the historic murals in the chancel. The polychrome interior (murals) of the church is worth special attention. This is a multi-coloured painted decoration, consisting of several layers. The oldest layer covers the walls around the main altar and the nave. It dates back to 1595‚Äì1607 and was most likely founded by Nicholas and Elizabeth of G≈Çadysz. It shows a series of 29 scenes devoted to the life and passion of Christ. On the southern wall can be seen the emblems of the founders (the Griffin and Trumpet signs). Over the door to the side porch is the scene of the decapitation of St. John the Baptist. The remaining surface of the walls of the nave is decorated by a newer layer - paintings dating back to the second half of the 17th century. The newest layer shows scenes of the Last Judgment and the figures of St. Peter and St. Paul. Historic murals were discovered during the restoration work carried out between 1965 and 1966. A year later the image of Our Lady Help of Christians of the late 16th century was discovered. Currently it is located on the main altar. The Baroque side altars from the late 18th century are noteworthy as well. On the left one is a mid-18th century image of St. Margaret and next to it - the 18th century pulpit. The oldest pieces in the church are the font and stoup of the 16th century. It is worth mentioning that between 1882 and 1883 the blessed Jan Balicki was working in Polna parish. On 18 August 2002 he was beatified by Pope John Paul II. An image commemorating him is located in the northern part of the church. This church is included as one of the 251 objects on the Wooden Architecture Trail in the province of Ma≈Çopolska [Lesser Poland], Southern Poland. There is a virtual tour of the church in four language versions, which is available at www.korona3d.pl  References  External links * Polna at Gmina Grybow website Villages in Nowy SƒÖcz County ","title":"Polna, Poland"},{"id":"53395608","text":"Norman \\"Jack\\" Ross (April 3, 1927- January 13, 2013) was an Arizona car dealer, philanthropist and politician who twice sought the Democratic nomination for Governor of Arizona.

The situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) was proposed by Jeong-Nam Kim and James E. Grunig in 2011 though their article ‚Äúproblem solving and communicative action: A situational theory of problem solving.‚Äù The theory was developed from the situational theory of publics (STP) and claimed it is ‚Äúan extended and generalized version‚Äù of STP. This theory has an assumption that ‚Äúthe more one commits to problem resolution, the more one becomes acquisitive of information pertaining to the problem, selective in dealing with information, and transmissive in giving it to others.‚Äù  History  = Extension from situational theory of publics = STP has been heavily used in the field of public relations to understand why and how publics communicate. The original situational theory uses three independent variables (problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition) to predict the dependent variable of information seeking and processing. STOPS was proposed to overcome four limitations of STP: # STP considered only information acquisition as a concept of active communication behaviors # The predictive power of referent criterion variable has been unclear throughout the development of STP # Only few antecedents of communication behavior were considered # STP was underutilized because of the narrow concept of information behaviors Alterations in existed variables (problem recognition, constraint recognition, involvement recognition, and reference criterion) were done to explain communicative action in problem solving variable. STOPS also expanded the focus of the theory from \\"decisions\\" to a more general concept of life \\"problems.\\" A new variable, situational motivation in problem solving, was added to mediate the effects of predictive variables of communicative behavior.  Concepts of key variables  = Situational antecedents: perceptual and cognitive frame in problem solving = * Problem Recognition: ‚Äúone‚Äôs perception that something is missing and that there is no immediately applicable solution to it.‚Äù * Constraint Recognition: perceived obstacles in a problem-solving task that reduce one's ability to do anything about the issue. Constraint recognition limit one's communication behaviors even when he or she has high problem recognition and/or involvement recognition. * Involvement Recognition: ‚Äúa perceived connection between the self and the problem situation.‚Äù This variable has the same concept of the level of involvement in the situational theory of publics. * Referent Criterion: ‚Äúany knowledge or subjective judgmental system that influences the way in which one approaches problem solving.‚Äù = Situational motivation in problem solving = The extent to which an individual wants to know more about a problem. This concept mediates the effect of problem recognition, constraint recognition, and involvement recognition. Referent criterion would be independent of this variable because it is more cognitive than perceptual. = Communicative behavior in problem solving = When an individual tries to solve a problem, his or her communicative activeness increases in three domains of communication action: information acquisition, selection, and transmission.  Information acquisition  The communicative action that is relevant to the degrees of information searching for problem solving. * Information seeking (active): a planned perusing of messages about a specific topic. * Information attending (passive): an unplanned exposure for messages about a specific topic.  Information selection  The communicative action that is relevant to the extent of an individual's directedness in acquiring and sharing information. * Information forefending (active): ‚Äúthe extent to which a communicator fends off certain information in advance by judging its value and relevance for a given problem-solving task.‚Äù Individuals with higher information forefending look for more specific, systematic, and accurate information. * Information permitting (passive): the extent to which an individual accept any information related to a problem-solving task.  Information transmission  The communicative action that is relevant to the degrees of educating others to utilize collective behaviors for problem solving. * Information forwarding (active): forwarding information even if no one requests for one's opinion, idea, or expertise about a problem. * Information sharing (passive): sharing of information only when other person asks for one's opinion, idea, or expertise about a problem.  Model  An individual's perception toward a problematic life situation, motivation to solve the problem, and activation of cognitive frames influence an individual's activeness in six information behaviors ‚Äì information forefending, information permitting, information forwarding, information sharing, information seeking, and information attending. Model of Situational Theory of Problem Solving  Applications of the theory  STOPS has more than 200 research bibliographies in academic databases such as Communication & Mass Media Complete, Business Source Premier, and Academic Search Premier. Some of the applications of this theory are in the fields of health communication, crisis communication, organizational communication, and nonprofit communication.

Players use the rifle-shaped light guns to fire at clay pigeons, represented as flying white dots on a projector screen. There are two that must be shot down in each round, and players only get two bullets to hit them. Bonus points are awarded for shooting the pigeons as soon as they appear, or by destroying both of them with a single bullet. Gameplay Shoot Away is a lightgun shooter arcade game that simulates the sport of skeet shooting. It uses a projector system that projects monochrome images against a panoramic backdrop, designed to resemble a forest clearing. Using the attached lightguns, players have two attempts to shoot at both white targets ‚Äî representing clay pigeons ‚Äî that arch across the screen. Both players' scores are shown on an LCD display attached to the gun holsters. There are two difficulty options, \\"Regular\\" and \\"Pro\\". Development and release Development of Shoot Away was done by Sho Osugi, an engineer for Namco that worked on many of the company's driving games for arcades. He was assisted by Kazunori Sawano, best known for his work on Namco's first major hit Galaxian. Shoot Away was one of Namco's first products exported outside Japan, helping establish intercontinental connections with other manufacturers. Reception and legacy Shoot Away was Namco's first major arcade hit, and performed considerably well in the United States. Satish Bhutani, the co-founder of Namco America, had difficulty in satisfying the growing demand for the game. Shoot Away remained a popular title in arcades well after its original release, with machines still being sold as late as 1986. Cash Box was enamored with the game's sense of realism, particularly its rifle-shaped lightguns and illuminated projector backdrop. They wrote that it provides \\"a very appealing atmosphere for the player\\". Electronic Fun with Computer & Games shared their admiration for its large, vibrant projector screen. In a 1991 retrospective article on electro- mechanical arcade games, CU Amiga writer Julian Rignall ranked Shoot Away as one of the \\"real interactive games\\". In 1978, Namco released a variation of Shoot Away named Clay Champ. It was designed to be smaller and more compact for arcades and other street locations, and used mirror effects combined with projection systems. Allied Leisure released the game in North America in June 1979. In the same year, Allied released a video version titled Clay Shoot. Namco released CosmoSwat in 1984, which was a reskin of Shoot Away that featured a science fiction-motif and a video display on the gun holster stand. A 1992 sequel, Shoot Away II, was published in Japan, featuring additional difficulties and new fiber optic lightguns. A version that featured rapid-fire lightguns was also produced. Shoot Away II is included as a minigame in Time Crisis II (2001) and Point Blank DS (2006). Namco released a version of Shoot Away for Japanese cellular phones in 2002 through the i-Mode network. A third sequel, Shoot Away Pro, was developed by Bandai Namco Amusement and released in March 2018.

In geometry, two triangles are said to be 5-Con or almost congruent if they are not congruent triangles but they are similar triangles and share two side lengths (of non- corresponding sides). The 5-Con triangles are important examples for understanding the solution of triangles. Indeed, knowing three angles and two sides (but not their sequence) is not enough to determine a triangle up to congruence. A triangle is said to be 5-Con capable if there is another triangle which is almost congruent to it. The 5-Con triangles have been discussed by Pawley:, and later by Jones and Peterson. They are briefly mentioned by Martin Gardner in his book Mathematical Circus. Another reference is the following exercise > Explain how two triangles can have five parts (sides, angles) of one > triangle congruent to five parts of the other triangle, but _not_ be > congruent triangles. A similar exercise dates back to 1955, and there an earlier reference is mentioned. It is however not possible to date the first occurrence of such standard exercises about triangles. Examples There are infinitely many pairs of 5-Con triangles, even up to scaling. * The smallest 5-Con triangles with integer sides have side lengths (8; 12; 18) and (12; 18; 27). This is an example with obtuse triangles. * An example of acute 5-Con triangles is (1000; 1100; 1210) and (1100; 1210; 1331). * The 5-Con right triangles are exactly those obtained from scaling the pair (1;m;m^2) and (m; m^2; m^3) with m=sqrt{frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}}=sqrt{phi} where œÜ is the golden ratio. Consequently, these are Kepler triangles and there can be no right 5-Con triangles with integer sides. * There are no 5-Con triangles that are equilateral or isosceles because that would require m = 1 and the 5-Con triangles would be congruent. * There are no integer 5-Con triangles that are Heronian because the sides of integer 5-Con triangles are in a geometric progression. Results 1. Consider 5-Con triangles with side lengths (a;b;c) and (ma;mb;mc) where m is the scaling factor, which we may suppose to be greater than 1. We may also suppose aleq bleq c. Then we must have b=ma and c=mb. The two triples of side lengths are then of the form: a(1;m;m^2)qquad mathrm{and} qquad a(m;m^2;m^3).Conversely, for any a>0 and 1, such triples are the side lengths for 5-Con triangles. (Supposing without loss of generality that a=1, the greatest number in the first triple is m^2 and we only need to ensure m^2<1+m; the second triple is obtained from the first by scaling with m. So we have two triangles: They are clearly similar and exactly two of the three side lengths coincide.) Some references work with m^{-1}<1 instead, which leads to the inequalities frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}. 2. Any 5-Con capable triangle has different side lengths and the middle one is the geometric mean of the other two. The ratio between the largest and the middle side length is then equal to that between the middle and the smallest side length. We can use both this ratio and its inverse for scaling and obtaining an almost congruent triangle. 5-Con triangles with the same greatest side. 3. To study the possible shapes of 5-Con triangles, we may restrict to studying the triangles with side lengths (1;m;m^2)qquad mathrm{where} qquad 1The greatest angle is a strictly increasing continuous function of m and varies from 60¬∞ to 180¬∞ (the limit cases are excluded). The right triangle corresponds to the value m=sqrt{frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}}. For convenience, scale the triangle to obtain (m^{-2};m^{-1};1), so that the largest side is fixed: The opposite vertex then moves along a curve as m is varied, as shown in the figure. 4. Having two 5-Con triangles with integral sides amounts (in the above notation) to taking any rational number 1 and then choosing a>0 in such a way that am^3is an integer. The four involved integral side lengths (a;am;am^2;am^3) do not share any common factor (the 4-tuple is then called primitive) if and only if they are of the form (x^3;x^2y;xy^2;y^3)where x,y are coprime positive integers. Further remarks Two 7-Con quadrilaterals. Defining almost congruent triangles gives a binary relation on the set of triangles. This relation is clearly not reflexive, but it is symmetric. It is not transitive: As a counterexample, consider the three triangles with side lengths (8;12;18), (12;18;27), and (18;27;40.5). There are infinite sequences of triangles such that any two subsequent terms are 5-Con triangles. It is easy to construct such a sequence from any 5-Con capable triangle: To get an ascending (respectively, descending) sequence, keep the two greatest (respectively, smallest) side lengths and simply choose a third greater (respectively, smaller) side length to obtain a similar triangle. One may easily arrange the triangles in the sequence in a neat way, for example in a spiral. One generalization is considering 7-Con quadrilaterals, i.e. non- congruent (and not necessarily similar) quadrilaterals where four angles and three sides coincide or, more generally, (2n-1)-Con n-gons.

It is a common spider orchid, especially after winter rains, occurring in a restricted area. It has a single hairy leaf and one or two creamy-coloured flowers. It was formerly included with Caladenia incensa.  Description  Caladenia pluvialis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which sometimes forms small clumps. It has a single erect leaf, long, wide and pale green. One or two dull cream to creamy-yellow flowers across are borne on a stalk high. The sepals and petals are linear to lance-shaped near their base then narrow to a reddish-black, thread-like glandular tip. The dorsal sepal is erect to slightly curved forward, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are long and wide and spread horizontally near the base, then curve downwards. The petals are long and wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long and wide and cream coloured with red lines and spots. The sides of the labellum have short, broad, forward-facing serrations, its tip is curled under and there are two rows of anvil-shaped calli up to long, along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to early September and is encouraged by good winter rainfall.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia pluvialis was first described in 2015 by Andrew Phillip Brown and Garry Brockman from a specimen collected near Mullewa and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (pluvialis) is a Latin word meaning \\"of rain\\" referring to the importance of rain to the flowering of this species, which otherwise grows in a low-rainfall area.  Distribution and habitat  The Yuna spider orchid occurs near Yuna and Mullewa in the Avon Wheatbelt and Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic regions. Conservation Caladenia pluvialis is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations.

History The building was originally called Daguanlo and was planned in 1895 and built in 1899 during the Japanese rule of Taiwan as an accommodation for a local rich businessperson, Mr. Li. It was then later on taken over by the chairperson of Tamsui Street, Mr. Hung, after the decline of Mr. Li's family business. Afterwards, the building had been experiencing many changes throughout the time until recently it has been converted into a Chinese restaurant and caf√©. Architecture The building is a three-story structure with Victorian architecture style. The ground and first floor is dedicated for a restaurant and the top most floor is dedicated for a caf√©.

These property taxes are called rates. They are assessed annually and usually paid in four equal instalments. Introduction New Zealand no longer has land taxes per se. Formerly, NZ did have land taxes - its first ever direct tax, enacted in 1878, was a land tax (levied at a rate of one halfpenny per pound of unimproved land value). But the contribution of land taxes to the government steadily reduced and by 1967 represented a mere 0.5% of total government revenues. In 1982 it was observed that only 5% of all land was taxed (the rest was exempted under one of an increasing list of exemptions), and so in 1990, land tax was repealed.See this Wikipedia entry for a short history of NZ's Land Tax. Instead, it has property taxes related to land. This might seem like a distinction in search of a meaning, and in simplest terms a property tax is more flexible than a land tax, and can be applied to both land and the improvements on the land.For a more detailed discussion on the difference, see, eg, Richard F Dye and Richard W England, ‚ÄòThe Principles and Promises of Land Value Taxation‚Äô in Richard F Dye and Richard W England (eds), Land Value Taxation: Theory, Evidence, and Practice (Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, 2009) 3, 4 n 1 In New Zealand, as in most countries, residents pay income tax, a Goods and Services Tax, and property taxes (as well as assorted other minor taxes and fees). Although property taxes are the least substantial of these three principal forms of taxation, they are generally held to be the most unpopular. They are possibly the most 'obvious', they are the hardest to structure or minimize, and they apply no matter if you are wealthy or poor. Being sensitive to the public dislike of property taxes, and a general feeling of alienation and disenfranchisement from the tax setting and policy process, the NZ Government set about a major rewrite of both the legislation defining how local government bodies were managed (the Local Government Act 2002 ) and the property tax setting process (this Act). Purpose of the Act Section 3 of the Act states its purpose in three points : (a) providing local authorities with flexible powers to set, assess, and collect rates to fund local government activities (b) ensuring that rates are set in accordance with decisions that are made in a transparent and consultative manner (c) providing for processes and information to enable ratepayers to identify and understand their liability for rates. The powers given to local authorities are indeed broad and flexible (as per the first point) which leads to the constraining second point - rates can only be set and collected after going through a formal process of consultation with the public. The third point makes the process even more transparent - it requires a detailed breakdown of the amount being collected in rates each year so that rate payers know exactly what they are funding. Provisions of the Act The Act sets out what types of land can be rated (i.e. taxed), either in full or partially, and what types of land are exempt from local government rates. The Act sets out parameters for how land can be differentiated, and the types of methods and formulas that can be used for assessing rates. It also contains administrative type provisions for how values are calculated and rates are assessed and collected, penalties for late payment, and other special case considerations. =Rateable land= The Act states that all land, unless otherwise excepted, is rateable. In Schedule 1 to the Act it defines 25 categories of land that are non-rateable and also 3 categories of land which are rateable at no more than 50% of the regular rate. Non-rateable land is primarily land that is owned by the national or local government, or owned by a charity and available to the public, and some categories of Maori land. Land that is at least 50% non-rateable is land owned or used by Agricultural and Pastoral Societies as showgrounds, sportgrounds (but not horse or greyhound racetracks) and/or land owned or used by any group for any branch of the arts. Non-rateable land is still liable to pay rates related to water supply, sewage disposal, and/or refuse collection. =Rateable units and SUIPs= Understanding what comprises a single rating unit is important when rates such as a Uniform Annual General Rate (see below) is imposed on each rating unit. The concept of rating unit is defined in the Rating Valuations Act 1998. Generally, each separate certificate of title is considered to be its own rating unit. But if multiple certificates of title are owned by the same person or persons, are used jointly as a single unit, and are either contiguous (i.e. next to each other) or separated only by a road or rail line or body of water, then they can be deemed a single rating unit. So, for example, a farmer with land on four different titles, on both sides of a road that goes through the middle of his property, would most likely have his four titles deemed to be a single rating unit. A second related concept is that of determining a count of Separately Used or Inhabited Parts of a Rating Unit (SUIP). It is possible that one rating unit might have multiple SUIPs on it - for example, a piece of land with three condo/apartments on it. This becomes relevant when general rates such as Uniform Annual General Charges are imposed, not per rating unit, but per SUIP. =Types of rates= The Act defines two main categories of rates - general rates and targeted rates. General rates A general type of rate is usually adopted when the local authority believes the community as a whole should pay for a service, or where there is no good reason or reason to separate the cost out and fund it specifically. General rates apply to all ratepayers within the local authority's jurisdiction. A general rate can be either a Uniform Annual General Charge which applies equally to all ratepayers, or a 'value based' rate which is based on some element of the property's value (either its unimproved (land) value, its combined value of land and improvements, or its annual value). Value based rates can be calculated either on a standard rate per dollar of rateable value, or at different rates for different categories of rating units. The different categories that could be considered are listed in Schedule 2 to the Act. More than one general rate can be imposed. For example, a ratepayer may be levied a UAGC of $200 plus a differential rate of 0.25% of the total property value. Targeted rates Targeted rates are sometimes used where a specific service or benefit is being provided unevenly to some ratepayers but not to others. Targeted rates can also be imposed on all ratepayers, with the monies received being earmarked to fund a specific purpose. An example of a targeted rate might be a 'Central Business District' rate imposed on property in a town's central business district and used to fund specific services in that area. Another example might be a water rate - possibly a flat fee per rating unit that is connected to a central water service, and/or possibly a fee per cubic metre of water provided. A related rate would be a sewage disposal rate, often calculated on the basis of the number of toilet bowls or urinals present in each rating unit. Water and sewage rates can have three 'states' associated with them. If a rating unit does not have that service available, then the first state (i.e. no charge) would apply. If a rating unit has the service available, but the service is not being used, then one level of rate might be imposed, and if the service is available and being used, then a second higher level of rate might be imposed. =Matters and factors= The Act employs confusing terminology when describing the process for setting targeted rates. It helps to see it as a two step process. In Schedule 2, it lists a set of matters - these are considerations that determine which rating units will be liable for, and which rating units will not be liable for a particular rate. In Schedule 3, it lists a set of factors - these are considerations that determine how and what amounts will be payable. There are nine matters that can be considered, for example, where the land is located, or the use to which the land is put. There are twelve factors that can be used in calculating rates, for example, the area of floor space within any buildings on the land or the value of improvements to the rating unit. 30% cap on flat fee rates Because they are felt to be regressive in nature, there is a 30% cap on how much of the total rates revenue can be collected from Uniform Annual General Charges and from targeted rates that are set on a uniform basis, except for uniformly targeted rates that apply for water supply or sewage disposal. =Calculating rateable values= The Act requires properties to be valued at least once every three years. The Rating Valuations Act (1998) covers much of this process, and Part 2 of this Act sets out the record keeping requirements of each local government body. Most local bodies have their rating database available online, and are required to have it available for free public inspection at their principal public office or an alternate appropriate location during regular business hours. Ratepayers can challenge the accuracy of their property valuation or the information held about their property. =Setting rates= The process of setting rates seems deceptively simply in the Act (section 23) - i.e., being set by a resolution of the local authority. This apparent simplicity is because most of the process is prescribed in section 103 of the Local Government Act 2002. It requires rates to be congruent with the Revenue and Financing Policy in the Long Term Plan, and for each year's rate-setting to be based on the annual plan for the year and its associated Funding Impact Statement. Rate models must be included in the FIS, and if the rate setting process isn't strictly followed, the rates thereby levied may be uncollectable. =Remitting and postponing rates= The Act allows local authorities to remit all or part of the rates on a rating unit if the local authority has established a formal policy allowing itself to do so. The act allows local authorities to postpone all or part of the rates on a rating unit, again if there is an existing formal policy allowing such postponement. The policy may set a fee that applies in such cases, but if a fee is applied, it can not exceed the actual administrative and financial costs involved. These types of waivers need to be formally reviewed at least once every six years by the local authoritySee s.102 of the Local Government Act 2002. There are also income-tested provisions under the Rates Rebate Act (1973) that provides a subsidy to low income homeowners to help them meet the cost of their rates. Problems with the Act The national government's Auditor General audits all local authority annual reports, and several times has prepared specific reports on common issues and concerns that have arisen from its reviews. After the first year of the new Act's operation, the Auditor General reported in 2005 on some inconsistencies to do with how local authorities could reset rates during a rating year, and how they should handle any rate surpluses collected. In 2006, the Auditor General reviewed the specific policies relating to postponement of rates. A formal inquiry, chaired by David Shand and sometimes referred to as the Shand Report, but formally titled 'Funding Local Government' was undertaken in 2006 and reported in 2007. This inquiry noted that in a number of respects, the consultation, planning and accountability practices of local authorities were more advanced than those of central government. Nonetheless, it came up with 96 specific recommendations grouped into eight categories for future improvements. One of the Report's more surprising recommendations was that local authorities should fund more capital works from debt, which it felt was a fair and appropriate way to fund long-term capital benefits, and which could allow for a 10% reduction of current rates. In general, very few of the Report's recommendations have been acted on. In 2014, the Auditor General provided some commentary on their auditing policies and issues uncovered to do with local authority rates. They reported that most local authorities had some problems with rating compliance, and that they uncovered compliance problems with every aspect of the Act's requirements. The report goes on to cite some of the problems uncovered, with the problems generally being failures of procedure or understanding of the Act's requirements, rather than being anything willfully fraudulent. Statistics It is difficult to give accurate time series data for rates revenues, due to the changing nature of local authorities, one-off transactions each year, and the dominating/distortive impact of Auckland. So we are providing some simple headline data here. Between the period 1993-94 and 2006-2007, rates increased by 38% in real terms, i.e., after adjusting for inflation. A report commissioned by the Local Government Association shows that real rates per household have increased by almost 50% between 1993 and 2011. The Department of Internal Affairs published a detailed set of time series and analysis of how rates were imposed in July 2011. In 2009-10, local authorities collected $2.9 billion in rates receipts, being 53% of total operating revenue of $5.5 billion. In 2010-11, local authorities rates receipts made up 54% of total operating revenue. This increased still further to 55% of total operating revenue in 2011-12. Following what seems to be a trend, rates made up 56% of total operating revenue in the 2012-13 year. For the 2013-14 year, although rate revenues increased 4% over the previous year, the percentage of total operating revenue dropped to 54% as a result of some asset revaluations in Auckland. The 2014-15 year showed rates receipts returning to 'normal' trends and totalling 57% of total revenues.

He was treasurer of the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad from 1861 to 1863, and briefly president of the New York Central Railroad in 1866. Early life Henry Keep was born on June 22, 1818, in Adams, New York, to Herman Chandler Keep and his wife, Dorothy ( Kent). He had two sisters, Mary and Martha. He was a descendant of John Keep, and emigrant from the Kingdom of England who arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1660 and was killed in 1676 during King Philip's War. He was also related to William Ezra Keep, a successful builder in Hartford, Connecticut. Keep had no schooling as a child. His father died in 1835 when Keep was just 17. His family was left impoverished and lost their home, so his mother turned herself and her children over to the county poorhouse. The county loaned children out as workers to local businessmen and farmers, if the employer provided a wage or some other means of improvement to the child. Keep was sent to work for Joseph Grammon, a local farmer who promised to send the boy to public school. Grammon failed to keep his word, beat the Henry mercilessly, and barely fed him. With $1.50 ($ in dollars) and a coat given to him by a friend, Keep ran away. Grammon later offered a reward of two cents for his return. Keep settled in Honeoye Falls, New York, where he got a job as a teamster on the Erie Canal, and later found a position as a hack driver in nearby Rochester, New York. Financier and railroad baron =Currency speculation= During the Panic of 1837, Keep would buy purchased depreciated Watertown banknotes in Rochester, then travel to Watertown (where the notes were worth more) and cash them for a profit. He quickly quadrupled his net worth. He then invested in notes issued by the state, which were trading at a discount due to the economic recession. He then began traveling around upstate New York, where he would approach people carrying Canadian banknotes. These were worthless in the United States, so Keep would exchange his state notes for the Canadian banknotes (at yet another heavy discount). When he had enough Canadian banknotes in hand, Keep would travel to Canada and cash the banknotes at par. He made $500 to $1,000 a week ($ to $ in dollars) a week in these exchanges. =Banking= On September 28, 1847, Keep established Henry Keep's Bank in Watertown, New York. Some time in 1850, Keep opened the Frontier Bank in Watertown. On August 1, 1850, Keep opened the Citizens' Bank in Watertown, and in 1852 opened a branch of this bank in Fulton, New York. On September 17, 1851, he opened the Mechanic's Bank in Watertown, and later invested in the Union Bank of Watertown. Keep proved so successful at banking that he moved to New York City in 1850, and began investment banking operations on Wall Street. =Railroading= Just prior to the American Civil War, railroad stocks were worth about a nickel each. Keep invested heavily in railroad stocks on the eve of the war, then saw his stocks soar in value as railroads became essential to the war effort. He also made bold trades in undervalued railroads, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars. Along with Jacob Barker, Daniel Drew, James Fisk, Jay Gould, Jacob Little, and Cornelius Vanderbilt, Keep was one of the greatest speculators on the stock market in his day. He also became one of the ablest stock pool managers in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. He was so successful at stock pools that he became one of the first managers of a \\"blind pool\\", where not even the contributors to the pool knew which stocks were being bought or sold, when, or at what price. His refusal to talk about his trading schemes earned him the nickname \\"Henry the Silent\\". Keep formed a partnership with LeGrand Lockwood, co-founder of Lockwood & Company. The firm was one of Wall Street's leading brokerage houses, Lockwood was a longtime ally of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Together, the two men manipulated the stock of the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad in the 1850s, buying large quantities whenever they forced the price down. They won control of the company in 1859. On April 25, 1860, Keep was elected to its board of directors. He served as its treasurer from 1861 to 1863. Keep solidified his hold on the company in 1863 by breaking Addison G. Jerome, who controlled a majority of the company's stock. Keep noticed that the board of directors was authorized to issue up to 14,000 shares in new stock. Keep called a secret meeting of the board, which excluded Jerome, and the board authorized the issue. Keep began selling small numbers of these shares, and Jerome began buying them up in an attempt to force Keep off the board of directors. To finance his purchases, Jerome engaged in short sales of stock. Keep then dumped the majority of the 14,000 shares on the market, causing the price to drop significantly. Jerome lost $3 million covering his short sales, and was financially broken. (He died a year later.) Keep also invested heavily in the New York Central Railroad. Beginning in 1865, Cornelius Vanderbilt began to wage a long and bitter war for control of the Central. The Central was governed by a clique of men known as the \\"Albany Regency\\", and controlled most of the rail traffic outside of New York City. But Vanderbilt's Hudson River Railroad not only had the only direct link between Albany, New York, and New York City but also had the only rail line into lower Manhattan. Vanderbilt won an agreement with the Central to transfer freight to his line. The contract also required the Central to pay the Hudson River Railroad $100,000 a year ($ in dollars) for keeping extra rolling stock on hand in the summer to handle the increased traffic moving north. Keep, LeGrand Lockwood, and American Express and Wells Fargo founder William Fargo decided to seek control of the Central. They quickly amassed almost two-thirds of the company's stock, and ousted the \\"Albany Regency\\". Keep, elected president of the Central on December 12, 1866, immediately revoked the yearly payment. An outraged Vanderbilt stopped carrying all Central freight. Steamboats could not move the Central's cargoes because the Hudson River was frozen due to a harsh winter. Freight backed up in Albany, and New York City was effectively cut off by rail. The Central's stock price fell. In an attempt to make money off the situation, Keep borrowed a significant number of shares to sell short. Flooding the market with shares only drove the price further downward, and Vanderbilt and his allies quickly purchased these shares. This forced Keep to pay his lenders out of his own pocket, hurting him financially, and allowed the Vanderbilt group to gain control of the Central. Keep resigned, and Horace Henry Baxter was named president of the Central in December 1866. Keep partnered with investor Rufus Hatch, and won control of the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1867. He made $1.5 million ($ in dollars) manipulating the road's stock. He was named its president in June 1868. Marvin Hughett, a veteran manager of the company, convinced him to finance a massive expansion of the railroad's system. Keep also was one of the largest investors in the Cleveland and Toledo Railroad. He was elected to its board of directors in 1859. He was also a director of the Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad in 1863. Personal life and death Keep married Emma Woodruff, daughter of a prominent Watertown hotel owner and real estate developer, in 1847. The couple had just one child, daughter Emma Gertrude Keep. Keep's health began to fail in early 1869. He was so ill that, on June 18, rumors swept Wall Street that he had died. Keep passed away late in the evening on July 30, 1869, at his home at 601 Fifth Avenue in New York City. He had just recently offered to donate $1.5 million to anyone willing to found a National Academy of Art. Keep's funeral was held in his home, and he was buried at Brookside Cemetery in Watertown, New York. His widow built a large mausoleum in which he was later laid to rest. In the Adams State Road Cemetery near Adams, New York, is a large mausoleum, built by Henry Keep, in which Keep's parents were laid to rest. Henry Keep's mausoleum was broken into in 1973, and his coffin opened and his remains disturbed. Police said that the vandals probably believed Keep had been buried with jewelry or other valuables. No culprits were ever found. Keep left his daughter $500,000 ($ in dollars) in railroad stock. His gave his sister Mary two farms near Watertown worth $185,000 ($ in dollars), his sister Martha $200,000 ($ in dollars) in cash, and each of his three sisters-in-law stock worth $100,000 ($ in dollars). The remainder of his estate, valued contemporaneously at $1 million ($ in dollars), and by financial historians at $4.5 million ($ in dollars), went to his wife. Legacy Keep's widow built the Henry Keep Home for the elderly, infirm, and widowed in Watertown. It opened in 1883. The building was razed in 1977, and a new structure erected on the same site. It is now known as the Samaritan-Keep House. Emma Keep also created a foundation in her husband's name to support the Henry Keep Home. The foundation built and currently owns several structures in Watertown: the Centennial Apartments, the Henry Keep Apartments on Washington Street, the Henry Keep Apartments on Public Square, and the Olympic Apartments. It also owns and maintains the Ives Hill Retirement Community as well as Keep House, a place for out-of-town families to stay while their loved ones are receiving medical care at the local hospital.

He has been Minister for Police in the government of Peter O'Neill since February 2014. Atiyafa was educated at the Finintugu Lutheran Primary School, Rongo Primary School and Asaroka Lutheran High School in the Eastern Highlands Province and Kerevat National High School in East New Britain Province, before graduating from the University of Papua New Guinea in political science. Prior to entering politics, he was a teacher at Henganofi High School, a public servant for the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government and council manager for the Henganofi Local Level Government Council. He was elected to the former Eastern Highlands Provincial Assembly for the Kafetina constituency in 1991, and was Premier of Eastern Highlands Province from 1991 to 1994. Following the 1995 abolition of decentralised provincial government, he was deputy governor of the province from 1995 to 1997. He was elected to the National Parliament as an independent at the 2012 election on his fifth attempt. He had previously been defeated in the Henganofi seat at the 1997, 2002 and 2007 elections, on the last occasion for the National Party. He immediately caused some controversy by proposing a bill that would ban commissions of inquiry and tribunals in what a major newspaper described as \\"an attempt to legalise official corruption\\". In February 2014, Atiyafa, who had by now joined the governing People's National Congress, was appointed Minister for Police. His government has faced a number of challenges in the police portfolio: in May 2015, Police Commissioner Geoffrey Vaki was sacked over concerns about declining standards and police brutality, and in August 2015 he directed police to refrain from carrying firearms in public wherever possible. He supported the involvement of Australian advisors in training Papua New Guinean police and advocated for the recruitment of officers from overseas in on-the-ground roles accountable to Papua New Guinean law, while expressing cynicism about previous arrangements involving the deployment of foreign police. During the 2016 student protests against the O'Neill government, he denied international media reports that demonstrators had been shot by police and stated that protestors preventing students from returning to class were \\"obstructing the rule of law and open to arrest and prosecution\\".

The brand specializes in tourbillion watches, which are often associated with luxury Swiss watch brands. The tourbillion movement is only manufactured in a handful of factories worldwide, traditionally retailing at high five or six figure prices (USD). Memorigin's founder decided that he could produce a quality mid-range tourbillion, which he would sell directly into the growing Chinese watch market. History William Shum founded the watch brand Memorigin in 2011 and the brand is based in Hong Kong, China. Shum attended university in America, majoring in both finance and economics. He studied undergraduate at the University of Southern California and later on obtained a master's degree at Cornell University. He moved back to Hong Kong, where he secured a job in investment banking, after graduating from Cornell. In 2008, he decided to pursue a different career with a more favorable work- life balance. He and his father both had an interest in tourbillon watches, with his father being one of the investors in a watch factory in Hangzhou, China. The factory had been producing tourbillon movements since 2000. Like many Chinese manufacturers, the factory Shum's father invested in had the technical know-how to produce elegant watch movements but no experience in creating a watch brand and taking it to market. At the time of the foundation of Memorigin, Shum was quoted saying, ‚Äúthere were only about 30 factories in the entire world making tourbillon, and only a few in China.‚Äù During the same interview with the NY Times, Shum stated that Swiss tourbillon watches in the market were limited and expensive. He felt that there was an opportunity to sell unique tourbillions into the watch market at more affordable prices. Watches =Models= The first watch model sold by the brand was the 2011 edition of the 'Antique', which retailed for US$3,800. Since its launch, the watchmaker has moved into high-end collectibles, such as their 2013 'Emperor Jade' model. The 'Emperor Jade' contained translucent sheets of precious hand- carved stones. This particular model was at the higher-end of the Memorigin range, priced at $38,000. Memorigin has also designed watches to be used as movie-themed merchandise in collaboration with global brands. Their Marvel watch collection featured well-known characters on the watch faces, such as Iron Man and Captain America. They have also designed watches for Hollywood merchandise, including Warner Brothers and Hasbro. They made Batman and Superman memorabilia watches for Warner Brothers and Transformers watches for Hasbro. This focus on superheroes is due to the Chinese interest in comics and the subsequent movies produced by various Hollywood studios. Shum stated, \\"most Hongkongers between the ages of 30 and 50 like superheroes, because we grew up with many of them, and they represent justice.\\" When asked about the difference between Chinese tourbillions and Swiss tourbillons, Shum stated \\"Chinese watches are developing and the target customers are not the same as those who buy exclusively Swiss watches. Swiss watches are produced in fewer quantities with a strong passion for traditional design and delicate functions. Chinese watches are now produced in larger quantities with more reasonable pricing.\\" =Design= The tourbillon watches made by Memorigin are unique because they fuse Chinese and Western design elements. When founding Memorigin, Shum stated he wanted to create watches that possess \\"Swiss precision with Chinese characteristics.‚Äù In an interview with Forbes, Shum stated thatMemorigin watches are often designed in collaboration with well- known Hong Kong watch collectors. Memorigin has always stated their interest in becoming a tailor-made watch brand, rather than a mass producer.

Written in the 1970s and not published until 2007 In early March 1965, Rosenthal was arrested by campus police for the misdemeanor charge of mouthing obscenities in public, along with others. A little earlier, he had defended John J. Thompson, a big fan of comic Lenny Bruce, whose speech at Berkeley‚Äôs student union was deemed obscene, although Thompson never uttered any four-letter obscenities. In solidarity, Rosenthal proclaimed to a crowd of 150 that he would soon order a thousand ‚ÄúF‚Ä¶ Communism‚Äù signs for the CCPA literature table.Jo Freeman, At Berkeley in the Sixties: The Education of an Activist, 1961-1965, Bloomington, IN, Indiana University Press, 2004, p. 231Seth Rosenfeld, Subversives: The FBI's War on Student Radicals, and Reagan's Rise to Power, New York, NY, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2012, pp. 234-244 Later, the ALA scheduled a talk and discussion at UC Berkeley entitled, ‚ÄúF‚Ä¶ Communism, A Right-wing Case for Sexual Freedom.‚ÄùThomas Duckworth, ‚ÄúThe Story Has No Beginning,‚Äù Natural Life Therapy Clinic, January 13, 2012 Many of the participating students, including Rosenthal‚Äôs CCPA cadres, were attempting to expand free speech protection beyond political speech to include obscene speech, causing an incident that The Daily Cal coined the ‚ÄúFilthy Speech Movement.‚ÄùSeth Rosenfeld, Subversives: The FBI's War on Student Radicals, and Reagan's Rise to Power, New York, NY, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2012, p. 244 The judicial maneuvering lasted a year.

The encounter introduced them to the libertarian and individualist anarchist philosophy, which helped facilitate the traditionalist and libertarian split at the 1969 YAF national convention, marking the first libertarian break with conservatism. The ALA lasted until the early 1970s. Similar to the political activism of hundreds of campus libertarian organizations and their publications, ALA operations subsided with the ending of the Vietnam War, where many campus activists joined the Libertarian Party after graduating.

The book is about the Appalachian values of his upbringing and their relation to the social problems of his hometown. The book was on The New York Times Best Seller list in 2016 and 2017. It was a finalist for the 2017 Dayton Literary Peace Prize.Dayton Literary Peace Prize. http://www.daytonliterarypeaceprize.org/ It attracted significant attention during the 2016 election from national media as a window into the white working class. In addition to the popular attention and critical acclaim the book received, it also provoked criticism from Appalachians who argued that Vance was not an authentic hillbilly or representative of the white working class. These critics allege that in Vance's book the author misleadingly conflates the experience and identity of his hillbilly grandparents, with whom he spent some summers as a boy, with his own. Other critics supported Vance's claims to represent this culture. Politically, Vance identifies as a social conservative who is nevertheless critical of the contemporary Republican Party's policies, particularly on economic policy, where he argues the Republican platform favors the interests of the wealthy at the expense of the working class. Early life James David Vance was born in August 1984 in Middletown, Ohio, as James Donald Bowman, the son of Donald Bowman and Bev Vance. Vance's only sister, Lindsay, had been born when his mother was 19 years old. His mother and father divorced when Vance was a toddler. Not long after, Vance was adopted by his mother's third husband. Vance's mother struggled with prescription pain medication which led to heroin addiction throughout his childhood. She left behind a string of husbands and offered little stability. As a result Vance and his sister were raised primarily by his grandparents. Education Vance was educated at Middletown High School, a public high school in his home town. After graduating, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served in Iraq, performing public affairs activities.https://www.ted.com/speakers/jd_vance Vance later received a B.A. degree from The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. At Ohio State, he worked for Republican state senator Bob Schuler. After graduating from Ohio State, Vance received a J.D. degree from Yale Law School. During his first year at Yale, his mentor and professor Amy Chua convinced him to write his memoir. Life and career After law school, Vance worked as a principal in a venture capital firm owned by Peter Thiel, known as Mithril Capital Management, LLC. In 2020, Vance raised $93 million for Narya Capital, based in Cincinnati, Ohio. In December 2016, Vance indicated that he planned to move to Ohio to start a nonprofit and potentially run for office and work on combating drug addiction in the Rust Belt. The nonprofit is called Our Ohio Renewal.Our Ohio Renewal http://ourohiorenewal.com/ In January 2017, Vance became a CNN Contributor. In April 2017, Ron Howard signed on to direct a film based on Hillbilly Elegy. In early 2018, Vance was reported to have been considering a bid for U.S. Senate as a Republican. Personal life Vance is married to one of his former law school classmates, Usha Chilukuri, an Indian-American woman who was a law clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts during the 2017‚Äì18 term and clerked for then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh in 2014‚Äì15. They have a son, Ewan. In August 2019, Vance converted to Catholicism in Cincinnati, Ohio, in a Baptism ceremony attended by various conservatives, including Rod Dreher. In an interview with Dreher after the ceremony Vance said he converted because he \\"became persuaded over time that Catholicism was true,\\" and described Catholic doctrine's influence on his political views.https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/ Works * References 1984 births Living people American Marine Corps personnel of the Iraq War CNN people Ohio State University alumni Yale Law School alumni United States Marines Ohio Republicans American Roman Catholics American venture capitalists Converts to Roman Catholicism People from Middletown, Ohio Catholics from Ohio ","title":"J.

Since then the church has changed its view in favor of the use of medical marijuana, but not recreational use.\\"We are in favor of appropriate use of medicinal marijuana, and it's our view that by calling upon our legislature and local leaders, we can quickly find an appropriate resolution.\\" ‚ÄîElder Jack N. Gerard of the Seventy https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/church-says-yes-to-regulated- medical-marijuana-but-no-to-utah-initiative?lang=eng Early prohibitions In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members, and two months later the state of Utah banned cannabis. Some scholars have linked the two events, arguing that cannabis usage by Mormon returnees who had earlier fled to Mexico led the church, and later the state, to make their decisions. Others contradict this, noting that Utah's prohibition laws were part of a larger package of anti-drug laws which happened to include cannabis, but did not indicate a statewide concern. 1971 decriminalization The decriminalization effort in 1971 was said to be strong in Utah due to the state's high rate of use of cannabis, and Mormon members' preference to handle matters within the church and family. Response to modern cannabis movement As medical and recreational cannabis decriminalization movements began in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century in the United States, the LDS Church has been asked for its position on the issue. In a 2010 conference for local church leaders in Colorado, general authorities of the church, including now current church president Russell M. Nelson, explained in answer to a question that the church has no position on medical marijuana and that the issue was left to individual consultation with scriptures and a member's bishop. This same stance was later reiterated in a private discussion among the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in a 2010 video that was made public in 2016. The discussion included consensus that the church opposed recreational marijuana use more broadly but had no position on medical use specifically. In February 2016, the church released a statement supporting efforts to legalize CBD oil in Utah, but not whole-plant cannabis remedies: In October 2016, the First Presidency of the LDS Church sent a letter to congregations in California, Nevada, and Arizona (states which were to vote on legalized recreational cannabis in November), urging members to oppose legalization: In a 2019 article in the church's youth magazine New Era, the following statement was given regarding cannabis: See also * Cannabis and religion * Religion and drugs References Further reading Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Latter Day Saint doctrines, beliefs, and practices 1915 in cannabis Cannabis in Utah The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ","title":"Cannabis and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"},{"id":"53396571","text":"Jean-Baptiste Pierre de Semell√© (16 June 1773 ‚Äì 25 January 1839) became a French division commander during the Napoleonic Wars.

It is served as a side dish, used as an ingredient in dishes such as coq au vin and beef bourguignon, in foods such as duxelles, as a topping for steaks and toast, and also as a garnish. Overview Saut√©ed mushrooms is a common dish prepared by the saut√©ing of sliced or whole edible mushrooms. Butter is typically used when saut√©ing the dish, and margarine and cooking oils such as olive oil and canola oil are also used. Clarified butter can be used, as can a mixture of oil and butter. The dish is typically cooked over a high heat until the mushrooms are browned, with the oil or butter being very hot in a pan before the mushrooms are added. Overcooking may create an inferior dish by causing the mushrooms to lose moisture and becoming shriveled. During the cooking process, the dish can be deglazed with the use of wine, and wine can be used as an ingredient in and of itself without deglazing. The dish can be flavored with lemon juice, various herbs and seasonings, salt and pepper. Additional ingredients such as minced green onions and shallots can also be used. The dish is vegetarian, and may have a meat-like texture. Uses Saut√©ed mushrooms is sometimes served as a side dish, and is also used as an ingredient in the preparation of dishes and foods such as beef bourguignon, coq au vin, poulet en cocotte, Poulet Saute Chasseur, soups and stews, sauces, and duxelles, a paste prepared by saut√©ing mushrooms, onions, shallots, and herbs in butter. Saut√©ed mushrooms is also used as a topping for cooked steaks and toast, as a side dish meant to specifically accompany steaks, and as a garnish.

It was China‚Äôs first luxury hotel when it opened as The Palace Hotel in 1989. The Peninsula Hotels, part of the Hong Kong And Shanghai Hotels Group, assumed management of the hotel in 1996 and renamed it The Peninsula Beijing in 2006. In 2017, the hotel completed a USD123 million renovation, becoming an all-suite hotel.  History  =Early History of the Site= The Peninsula Beijing is located on Goldfish Lane (Jinyu hutong) in Beijing's historic Wangfujing area. =The Palace Hotel= In May 1986, the foundations were laid for The Palace Hotel, the original name of The Peninsula Beijing. By late 1987, the hotel building designed by architect K.Y. Cheung had acquired its iconic Chinese hip-and- gable roof covered in traditional glazed roof tiles, which remains a signature feature in the area today. After three years of construction, the hotel opened in May 1989. The hotel was constructed and initially owned by the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department, who transferred their shares to China Everbright Group in 1999. The first stores in Mainland China for Louis Vuitton, Chanel & Herm√®s opened in the hotel's shopping arcade during the 1990s. =The Peninsula Beijing= The Peninsula Hotels assumed management of The Palace Hotel in 1996, and the following year the hotel undertook its first renovation. The guest rooms were redesigned to include proprietary in-room technology that was, at the time, unique for a hotel in Beijing. In September 2003, The Palace Hotel was renamed The Peninsula Palace Beijing. In 2006, it became The Peninsula Beijing, following the completion of a four-year phased renovation from 2000 - 2004. = Major Renovation = In 2016, 27 years after its original opening, The Peninsula Beijing embarked upon an RMB890 million (US$123 million) landmark renovation. The renovation doubled the size of its rooms and renovated all its public spaces. The number of units was reduced from 525 to 230.  Prominent Visitors  Since its opening in 1989, The Peninsula Beijing has hosted a range of prominent visitors. General Yang Dezhi visited the hotel's construction site in 1986, as the hotel was constructed by what was then known as the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department. In 1990, Yang Shangkun, then the President of the People's Republic of China visited the hotel for an inspection.

Three-dimensional Euclidean space can be completely filled by copies of any one of these shapes, with no overlaps. The resulting honeycomb will have symmetries that take any copy of the plesiohedron to any other copy. The plesiohedra include such well- known shapes as the cube, hexagonal prism, rhombic dodecahedron, and truncated octahedron. The largest number of faces that a plesiohedron can have is 38. Definition A set S of points in Euclidean space is a Delone set if there exists a number varepsilon>0 such that every two points of S are at least at distance varepsilon apart from each other and such that every point of space is within distance 1/varepsilon of at least one point in S. So S fills space, but its points never come too close to each other. For this to be true, S must be infinite. Additionally, the set S is symmetric (in the sense needed to define a plesiohedron) if, for every two points p and q of S, there exists a rigid motion of space that takes S to S and p to q. That is, the symmetries of S act transitively on S. The Voronoi diagram of any set S of points partitions space into regions called Voronoi cells that are nearer to one given point of S than to any other. When S is a Delone set, the Voronoi cell of each point p in S is a convex polyhedron. The faces of this polyhedron lie on the planes that perpendicularly bisect the line segments from p to other nearby points of S.. See especially section 1.2.1, \\"Regularly Placed Sites\\", pp. 354‚Äì355. When S is symmetric as well as being Delone, the Voronoi cells must all be congruent to each other, for the symmetries of S must also be symmetries of the Voronoi diagram. In this case, the Voronoi diagram forms a honeycomb in which there is only a single prototile shape, the shape of these Voronoi cells. This shape is called a plesiohedron. The tiling generated in this way is isohedral, meaning that it not only has a single prototile (\\"monohedral\\") but also that any copy of this tile can be taken to any other copy by a symmetry of the tiling.. As with any space-filling polyhedron, the Dehn invariant of a plesiohedron is necessarily zero.. Examples The plesiohedra include the five parallelohedra. These are polyhedra that can tile space in such a way that every tile is symmetric to every other tile by a translational symmetry, without rotation. Equivalently, they are the Voronoi cells of lattices, as these are the translationally-symmetric Delone sets. Plesiohedra are a special case of the stereohedra, the prototiles of isohedral tilings more generally. For this reason (and because Voronoi diagrams are also known as Dirichlet tesselations) they have also been called \\"Dirichlet stereohedra\\" There are only finitely many combinatorial types of plesiohedron. Notable individual plesiohedra include: *The five parallelohedra: the cube (or more generally the parallelepiped), hexagonal prism, rhombic dodecahedron, elongated dodecahedron, and truncated octahedron.. Voronoi conjectured that all tilings of higher dimensional spaces by translates of a single convex polytope are combinatorially equivalent to Voronoi tilings, and Erdahl proves this in the special case of zonotopes. But as he writes (p. 429), Voronoi's conjecture for dimensions at most four was already proven by Delaunay. For the classification of three-dimensional parallelohedra into these five types, see . *The triangular prism, the prototile of the triangular prismatic honeycomb.. More generally, each of the 11 types of Laves tiling of the plane by congruent convex polygons (and each of the subtypes of these tilings with different symmetry groups) can be realized as the Voronoi cells of a symmetric Delone set in the plane.. It follows that the prisms over each of these shapes are plesiohedra. As well as the triangular prisms, these include prisms over certain quadrilaterals, pentagons, and hexagons. *The gyrobifastigium is a stereohedron but not a plesiohedron, because the points at the centers of the cells of its face-to-face tiling (where they are forced to go by symmetry) have differently-shaped Voronoi cells. However, a flattened version of the gyrobifastigium, with faces made of isosceles right triangles and silver rectangles, is a plesiohedron. *The triakis truncated tetrahedron, the prototile of the triakis truncated tetrahedral honeycomb and the plesiohedron generated by the diamond lattice *The trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron, the prototile of the trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb and the plesiohedron generated by the hexagonal close-packing *The 17-sided Voronoi cells of the Laves graph. Many other plesiohedra are known. Two different ones with the largest known number of faces, 38, were discovered by crystallographer Peter Engel.. For many years the maximum number of faces of a plesiohedron was an open problem,.. but analysis of the possible symmetries of three-dimensional space has shown that this number is at most 38. The Voronoi cells of points uniformly spaced on a helix fill space, are all congruent to each other, and can be made to have arbitrarily large numbers of faces.. However, the points on a helix are not a Delone set and their Voronoi cells are not bounded polyhedra. A modern survey is given by Schmitt..

Boutros-Ghali ran unopposed for a second term and received the support of 14 of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council. However, the United States vetoed his re-selection and eventually forced him to withdraw his candidacy. The open selection then deadlocked as France vetoed all candidates from English-speaking countries, while the United States vetoed all candidates from French-speaking countries. France eventually changed its veto to an abstention, and Kofi Annan of Ghana was selected Secretary-General for a term beginning 1 January 1997. The 1996 selection marks the only time that a sitting Secretary-General was denied a second term.  Background  The elderly Boutros-Ghali initially intended to serve only one term, but he ran for a second term in 1996. Traditionally, the Secretary-General is entitled to run unopposed for a second term. No sitting Secretary-General had ever been denied a second term by a veto. In the 1950 selection, Trygve Lie was vetoed by the Soviet Union, but he was re-appointed by the General Assembly without a recommendation from the Security Council. In the 1976 selection, Kurt Waldheim received a single symbolic veto from China, which turned around and voted for him in the second round. Boutros Boutros- Ghali had been selected Secretary-General in 1991 without the support of the United States, which abstained. After 15 U.S. peacekeepers died in a failed raid in Somalia in 1993, Boutros-Ghali became a political scapegoat in the United States. U.S. ambassador Madeleine Albright criticized Boutros-Ghali for the failed raid, and U.S. president Bill Clinton announced that future U.S. peacekeepers \\"will be under American command.\\" However, the dead peacekeepers had already been under U.S. command. Tensions grew worse as Boutros-Ghali pressed the United States over $1.5 billion in unpaid U.N. dues, while the United States pushed him to cut programs that were favored by developing countries. The breaking point came over the Bosnian War, when Boutros-Ghali refused to allow British and French commanders to authorize airstrikes against Serb troops. During the 1996 U.S. presidential campaign, Republican candidate Bob Dole made fun of Boutros-Ghali's name, and Clinton decided to eliminate Boutros-Ghali to help in his own reelection bid.  Re-selection of Boutros- Ghali  Boutros-Ghali ran unopposed for re-selection, as he enjoyed the support of every other member of the Security Council and was backed by the developing countries in the General Assembly. Boutros-Ghali had the support of France, as he spoke French fluently and had studied at the Sorbonne. Supporters of Boutros-Ghali also hoped that China would fight a veto duel with the United States, as it had done in the deadlocked 1981 selection. If the 1996 selection could be deadlocked, then the General Assembly could appoint Boutros-Ghali to a second term without a recommendation from the Security Council. The United States had set the precedent by taking the 1950 selection directly to the General Assembly after the Soviet Union vetoed Trygve Lie's second term. = Operation Orient Express = Madeleine Albright, Richard Clarke, Michael Sheehan, and James Rubin entered a secret pact, which they called \\"Operation Orient Express.\\" The name reflected their hope that other countries would join the United States in overthrowing Boutros-Ghali. However, U.S. President Bill Clinton told them that they \\"would never pull it off.\\" As support for Boutros-Ghali grew, the United States increased the pressure on his supporters. U.S. officials threatened to \\"take action\\" against U.N. officials who campaigned for Boutros-Ghali using U.N. funds, even though it could not name anyone who had done so. An unnamed U.S. official warned in a United States Information Agency report that continued support for Boutros- Ghali would cost Africa its second term in the Secretary-General rotation. The United States even offered to support Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania, who had been vetoed by the U.S. after winning the 1981 selection by one vote. A former U.N. official said that the Clinton administration appeared to be in a \\"frenzy\\" over Boutros-Ghali's resistance. On 17 November 1996, U.S. ambassador Madeleine Albright asked Boutros-Ghali to resign and offered to start a new foundation in Geneva for Boutros-Ghali to run. Other Western diplomats called the offer \\"ludicrous,\\" as Boutros-Ghali's family was wealthy and already supported several foundations in Egypt, while Albright would have a hard time convincing the U.S. Congress to pay for a foundation. Boutros-Ghali declined the American offer and said that he was not looking for another job. = US veto = On 18 November 1996, the United Nations Security Council conducted a straw poll to gauge the level of support for Boutros-Ghali. The vote was 13‚Äì1‚Äì1, with only the United States voting against. The United Kingdom delegation abstained because it had not received any instructions from London. On 20 November 1996, the Security Council met in closed session to consider draft resolution S/1996/952, appointing Boutros-Ghali for a second term. The resolution received 14 votes in favor, 1 vote against, and no abstentions. The only negative vote was the promised U.S. veto. The U.S. veto was widely criticized by foreign diplomats, who referred to it as a \\"mugging.\\" Boutros- Ghali complained that he was not \\"Noriega or Saddam Hussein\\" and compared the United States to the Roman Empire. CNN founder Ted Turner said that \\"Even England voted to re-elect this man and England always does what the United States asks them to do.\\" British diplomat Brian Urquhart described members of the U.S. Congress were \\"very xenophobic, extremely touchy, and, I think, very ignorant,\\" and said that the Secretary-General \\"isn't supposed to be a member of the [U.S.] State Department.\\" Even the conservative New York Post criticized Clinton for \\"indulg[ing] an obsession\\" and \\"demonstrat[ing] extraordinary diplomatic isolation.\\" Meanwhile, the conspirators in Operation Orient Express prevailed on Clinton to resist foreign pressure and continue the veto. = Deadlock = The Security Council met again on 21 November 1996 and 25 November 1996. No vote was taken, as none of the members had changed their positions. The United States also refused to nominate its own candidate, who would certainly be rejected by the Security Council. U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright insisted that the Africans must come up with their own candidate to replace Boutros-Ghali. American diplomats again warned that Africa would lose its turn in the Secretary-Generalship rotation if they did not come up with another candidate. However, Botswana's representative said that \\"We have a list composed of one person, Dr. Boutros-Ghali.\\" On 29 November 1996, the Security Council met again without taking a vote. The same day, the Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity wrote its members soliciting additional nominations. However, no nominations were forthcoming, as no African country wanted to undermine Boutros-Ghali by nominating another candidate. France and other European nations suggested a compromise in which Boutros-Ghali would be appointed to a short two-year term, following the precedent of U Thant's selection for a 17-month term in 1961. However, the United States did not respond to these proposals. The impasse was finally broken on 5 December 1996, when Boutros-Ghali suspended his candidacy. The selection was now thrown open to other candidates.  Open selection  Anticipating the U.S. veto, Security Council President Nugroho Wisnumurti of Indonesia laid down procedures on 12 November 1996 to be followed in case of an open selection. The Security Council would vote in secret in a series of straw polls. After a likely winner emerged, the next straw poll would have the permanent members voting on red paper to reveal the existence of any vetoes, while the rotating members voted on white paper. When at least one candidate received at least nine votes and no vetoes, a Resolution would finally be introduced and a vote would be taken. The \\"Wisnumurti Guidelines\\" formalized the process that had been used to break the deadlocked selection of 1981, and they have been used in all subsequent open selections. Four African candidates were nominated to replace Boutros-Ghali: Amara Essy of C√¥te d'Ivoire, Kofi Annan of Ghana, Hamid Algabid of Niger, and Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah of Mauritania. The Security Council met on 6 December 1996 but did not vote, awaiting more candidates. However, no other candidates were nominated. Moustapha Niasse of Senegal was not nominated because he would be vetoed by China. Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania was not nominated because he would be vetoed by France, an ironic twist for a diplomat who had been vetoed by the United States in 1981. With the General Assembly expecting to end its session on 17 December 1996, the Security Council had only one week to select a Secretary-General. In the first straw poll on 10 December 1996, Annan led with a vote of 12-2-1 with 1 veto, and Essy came in second with a vote of 11-4-0 with 2 vetoes. Annan was vetoed by France, while Essy was vetoed by the United States and the United Kingdom. Although Annan spoke French fluently, Ghana is a former British colony and Annan attended university in the United States. In the second round, Annan led with a vote of 10-3-1 with 1 veto, and Essy came in second with 7 votes in favor and 2 vetoes. All of the French-speaking candidates were vetoed by the United States and the United Kingdom. In the third round on 11 December 1996, Annan led with a vote of 11-4-0, including a French veto. Essy was in second place with a vote of 6-4-4, including U.S. and British vetoes. Despite the deadlock between the French-speaking and the English-speaking countries, diplomats believed that they had to find an African for the post because China would veto any non-African candidate. In the fourth round on 12 December 1996, Annan became the favored candidate with a vote of 14-1-0, the sole negative vote being a French veto. On 13 December 1996, France dropped its veto against Annan. The Security Council adopted Resolution 1090 by acclamation, recommending Kofi Annan to be the next Secretary-General of the United Nations. On 17 December 1996, the General Assembly adopted Resolution A/51/L.66, appointing Kofi Annan as Secretary- General for a term ending 31 December 2001.  2001 re-selection  Kofi Annan ran unopposed for re-selection in 2001. Due to Boutros-Ghali's non-reelection, a second Annan term would give Africa the office of Secretary-General for three consecutive terms. In 2001, the Asia-Pacific Group agreed to a third term for Africa in return for the African Group's support for an Asian Secretary-General in the 2006 selection. The Security Council passed Resolution 1358 by acclamation on 27 June 2001, recommending Annan for a second term. The General Assembly approved his reappointment on 29 June 2001 in Resolution A/55/L.87. Annan's second term ran until 31 December 2006, setting the stage for the 2006 Secretary-General selection.

Previously, dinoflagellates had been grouped into two categories, phagotrophs and phototrophs. Mixotrophs, however include a combination of phagotrophy and phototrophy. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates are a sub-type of planktonic dinoflagellates and are part of the phylum Dinoflagellata. They are flagellated eukaryotes that combine photoautotrophy when light is available, and heterotrophy via phagocytosis. Dinoflagellates are one of the most diverse and numerous species of phytoplankton, second to diatoms. Dinoflagellates have long whip-like structures called flagella that allow them to move freely throughout the water column. They are mainly marine but can also be found in freshwater environments. Combinations of phototrophy and phagotrophy allow organisms to supplement their inorganic nutrient uptake This means an increased trophic transfer to higher levels in food web compared to the traditional food web. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates have the ability to thrive in changing ocean environments, resulting in shifts in red tide phenomenon and paralytic shellfish poisoning. It is unknown as to how many species of dinoflagellates have mixotrophic capabilities, as this is a relatively new feeding-mechanism discovery.  Species  Some dinoflagellates that live as parasites are probably mixotrophic. Karenia, Karlodinium, and Lepidodinium are some of the dinoflagellate genera which are thought to contain peridinin, a carotenoid pigment necessary for photosynthesis in dinoflagellates; however, chlorophyll b has been found in these genera as an accessory pigment. This discovery has led scientists to assume that the pigment chlorophyll b actually came from prey which had been ingested by the dinoflagellates. Some species of mixotrophic dinoflagellate are able to feed on toxic prey such as toxic algae and other toxic organisms. For example, Lingulodinium polyedrum and Akashiwo sanguinea are two species of mixotrophic dinoflagellates that are known to feed on the toxic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium tamarense. Certain species of mixotrophic dinoflagellates can be affected by light intensity and nutrient conditions . For example, ingestion rates of Fragilidium subglobosum, Gymnodinium gracilentum, and Karlodinium veneficum increase as light intensity increases up to 75 to 100 ¬µmol photon m‚àí2 s‚àí1. In contrast, other species are not affected by light intensity. As well, ingestion rates of the mixotrophic dinoflagellate Ceratium furca are affected by intracellular nutrient concentrations.  Types of feeding  Marine dinoflagellate species undergo three major trophic modes: autotrophy, mixotrophy and heterotrophy. Many species of dinoflagellates were previously assumed to be exclusively autotrophic; however, recent research has revealed that many dinoflagellates that were thought to be exclusively phototrophic are actually mixotrophic. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates can undergo both photosynthesis and phagocytosis as methods of feeding. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates with individual plastids that depend mostly on photosynthesis can prey on other cells as their secondary source of nutrients. On the other hand, mixotrophic dinoflagellates with individual plastids that depend mainly on phagocytosis are also photosynthetic due to chloroplasts 'stolen' from their prey (kleptochloroplasts) or because of algal endosymbionts. It was discovered that the mixotrophic dinoflagellates Gonyaulax polygramma and Scrippsiella spp. can engulf small-size prey using their apical horn while larger prey are engulfed via their sulcus, showing that dinoflagellates can have more than one mouth for feeding. Moreover, mixotrophic dinoflagellates belonging to the species Karlodinium armiger, can capture small prey by direct engulfment or can use an extendable peduncle to capture larger prey.  Implications for microbial food webs  Mixotroph dinoflagellates belonging to the species Gymnodinium sanguineum feed on nanociliate populations in Chesapeake Bay. Predation on ciliates is advantageous for G. sanguineum as the ciliates provide a source of nitrogen which is limiting to the growth of purely photosynthetic dinoflagellates. By preying on ciliates, these dinoflagellates reverse the normal flow of material from primary producer to consumer and influence the trophodynamics of the microbial food web in Chesapeake Bay Several established ecological models of marine microbial food webs have not included feeding by mixotrophic dinoflagellates. These additions would include feeding by mixotrophic dinoflagellates on bacteria, phytoplankton, other mixotrophic dinoflagellates and nanoflagellates, and heterotrophic protists. The impact of grazing by mixotrophic dinoflagellates will affect particular prey species and be influenced by the abundance of dinoflagellate predators and their ingestion rates. Another consideration would be to include predator-prey relationships of mixotrophic dinoflagellates at a species level due to co-existence in offshore and oceanic waters. The diversity of mixotrophic dinoflagellate species and their interactions with other marine organisms contributes to their diverse roles in different niche environments. For example, mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates may act as predators on a wide range of prey types due to their diverse feeding mechanisms. Including mixotrophic dinoflagellates would better explain the control of prey population and cycling of limited materials as well as competition between other organisms for larger prey.  Climate Change and Ocean Acidification  As CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere increase via anthropogenic causes, acidification of the ocean will increase as the result of increasing CO2 sequestration by the ocean; the ocean is a great sink for carbon, absorbing more as its concentration in the atmosphere increases. As this occurs, there will be species and community composition shifts in marine plankton communities. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates will be favoured over photosynthetic dinoflagellates, as the oceans will become more nutrient limited and mixotrophs will not have to rely only on inorganic nutrients but will be able to take advantage of being able to consume particulate organic matter. With an increase in temperature, there is an increase in water column stability, which leads to favourable conditions for mixotrophic growth. Mixotrophs can grow in low nutrient (more stable) environments and become dominant members of planktonic communities. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can be caused by increased stability or increases in nutrients due to acidification and climate change, as well. This can have large impacts on the food chain and pose harmful effects to humans and their food sources through harmful blooms of dinoflagellates and other taxa, and lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning, for example.  Influence on red tide and HABs  Algal bloom (akasio) by Noctiluca spp. in Nagasaki Many mixotrophic and some heterotrophic dinoflagellates are known to cause red tides or harmful blooms that result in large-scale mortality of fish and shellfish. Studies on red tides have been conducted to determine the mechanism of outbreak and the persistence of red tides caused by mixotrophic dinoflagellates such as Karenia brevis, Prorocentrum donghaiense and Prorocentrum minimum in low nutrient concentration waters. In the case of serial red tides, one mixotrophic dinoflagellate species is dominated by another mixotrophic species in rapid succession over a short span of days. A possible explanation for the occurrence of different dominant mixotrophic dinoflagellates during serial red tides is the ability of mixotrophic dinoflagellates to feed on both heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria (such as Synecchococcus) spp., which provide limiting nutrients such as phosphorus, and nitrogen simultaneously. It is proposed that during serial red tides, feeding by larger mixotrophic dinoflagellates on smaller species may be a driving force for the succession of dominant species. Nitrogen and phosphorus is taken up by direct transfer of the materials and energy between the mixotrophic dinoflagellates; therefore, nutrient supply does not rely on the release of nitrogen and phosphorus by other organisms. Hence, mixotrophy can cause uncoupling between nutrient concentrations and the abundance of mixotrophic dinoflagellates in natural environments. Red tides are a type of harmful algal bloom (HABs); both are the result of massive proliferation of algae that result in very high concentrations of cells that visibly colour the water. The very high levels of biomass in Red Tides or HABs can have direct toxic effects through the release of toxic compounds or indirect effects through oxygen depletion on mammals, fish, shellfish, and humans. PSP (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning) is one example of a toxin that is produced by dinoflagellates that can have lethal consequences if contaminated shellfish are ingested; the toxin is a neuro- inhibitor that is concentrated in the flesh of bivalves and molluscs that have fed on toxic algae The toxin concentrations can cause harmful and even deadly effects on humans and marine mammal populations that feed on contaminated shellfish.  Relationship to other organisms  Mixotrophic dinoflagellates can feed on various organisms including bacteria, picoeukaryotes, nanoflagellates, diatoms, protists, metazoans and other dinoflagellates, as well. Feeding and digestion rates in mixotrophic dinoflagellates are lower than those in strictly heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates do not feed on blood, eggs, adult metazoans, and flesh, such as occurs in some heterotrophic dinoflagellates.

Junior career Moulding skipped the Alberta team at both the 2000 and 2003 Canadian Junior Curling Championships. At the 2000 Juniors, he led his team of Thomas Usselman, Ryan Inaba and Matt Taylor to a 5-7 record, missing the playoffs. At the 2003 Juniors, he led his rink of Brock Virtue, Taylor and Nicolas Virtue to a silver medal finish. The team finished the round robin with an 8-4 record, the proceeded to win the tiebreaker match and the semifinal before losing to Saskatchewan (skipped by Steve Laycock) in the final. Men's career After juniors, Moulding formed his own team to play on the World Curling Tour. He played in his first Grand Slam of Curling event when he was invited to play third for Steve Laycock at the 2006 Masters of Curling, where they failed to qualify for the playoffs. Moulding found little success skipping on the tour, failing to win a single event before he joined the Steve Petryk rink in 2009. He played one full season with Petryk, finding little success with him either. Moulding began skipping his own team again in 2010, but did not play in many events for the next few seasons. In 2013, Moulding joined the Matthew Blandford rink has his third. That season, Moulding won his first career tour event, when the rink won the McKee Homes Fall Curling Classic. The next season, the team played in Moulding's second career Slam event, the 2014 National, where they won two games. Later in the season, Moulding was invited to play for his former junior teammate Brock Virtue's team at the Black Diamond / High River Cash event, which they won. For the 2015-16 season, Virtue joined the Blandford rink as skip, moving Moulding to play second. The team would not win any events. Virtue left the rink at the end of the season. In 2017, Moulding was asked to join the Brendan Bottcher rink mid-season, replacing Pat Simmons (at third) who was suffering from an injury. The announcement was just in time for Moulding to play in the 2017 Meridian Canadian Open Grand Slam event. The new lineup found immediate success, making the quarterfinals of the event. The next month, the team would win the 2017 Boston Pizza Cup, the Alberta men's provincial championship. The win would be Moulding's first provincial title, sending him to his first ever Tim Hortons Brier. At the Brier, the team finished with a 3-8 record, missing the playoffs. Moulding and Team Botcher qualified for the 2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials (held from December 2 to 10 at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa, Ontario) by winning one of the two pre-trials spots at the Home Hardware Road to the Roar Pre-Trials on November 6 to 12 in Summerside, Prince Edward Island. Team Bottcher qualified as Team Alberta for the 2018 Tim Hortons Brier, held from March 3 to 11, 2018 at the Brandt Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan. The team had a 6-1 round robin record, and had to fight through the 3 vs. 4 game beating Brad Jacobs (Northern Ontario) and John Epping (Ontario) in the semifinals in the playoffs to make it to the final, where they would lose to Brad Gushue of Team Canada 6 to 4. 2018 Team Bottcher won the Canad Inns Men‚Äôs Classic beating Team Koe in the finals with a score of 7-5. The team came in second to Brad Jacobs losing in the finals at the Grand Slam of Curling 2018 Tour Challenge. In 2019 he would win his 1st Grand Slam of Curling titles at the Meridian Canadian Open with an 6-3 win over Team Epping, in April The Players Championship with a 6-1 win over Team Koe and again in the Champions Cup with another 6-5 win over Team Koe. Earlier in the year. Team Bottcher would win the 2019 Pinty's All-Star Curling Skins Game, the team winning $54,500. At the 2019 Tim Hortons Brier (held from March 2 to 10 at Westoba Place in Brandon, Manitoba), Team Bottcher played their way into the main draw by winning the wildcard game over Team Epping (Ontario) and then went 8-3 in the round-robin, making the playoffs for the second straight year.

Simon Bradstreet was replaced as minister by Isaac Story, Story was introduced to his congregation in Marblehead by Ebenezer Pemberton in his sermon to the community.Pemberton Story married the daughter of Bradstreet (Rebecca Bradstreet) and moved into the house. Story was born in 1749 and a native of Boston, a graduate of the College of New Jersey in 1768. He was the minister of the Second Congregational Church of Marblehead in Marblehead, Massachusetts, from 1771-1802.

She co- founded the Democratic Progressive Party in 1986, but was expelled over a 2009 trip to China. Education and activism Hsu graduated from National Taiwan Normal University. When her husband Chang Chun-hung was imprisoned in the aftermath of the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident, Hsu left her job as a teacher to run for the Legislative Yuan. Because Hsu was active in the tangwai movement as a distributor of opposition publications, the Kuomintang raided her house for copies of Senh Kin and Taiwan Weekly in January 1984 and September 1985, respectively. Political career In her 1980 election to the legislature, Hsu won 190,000 votes, a district record, and was the only tangwai-affiliated woman to be seated. During her first term, Hsu continued active participation in opposition causes, visiting jailed activist Lin Hung-hsuan in January 1985 and making a May 1986 trip to the United States to address the first meeting of the US Congressional Committee for Democracy on Taiwan alongside Chou Ching-yu. That September, she and seventeen others founded the Democratic Progressive Party. Within the DPP, Hsu was linked to the New Dynamics and Formosa factions. She was entrusted with the responsibilities of high ranking party posts, becoming the first woman to serve as party whip. Hsu was also chair of the Central Review Committee and has served on the Central Standing Committee. Though she stepped down at the end of her term in 2005, Hsu was reappointed to the Legislative Yuan when Tsai Huang-liang chose to run for the Nantou County magistracy. Hsu was sworn in on 23 June. The next year, Kuomintang legislator Chiu Yi accused Hsu and others of embezzlement. In 2007, Hsu visited China to discuss Cross-Strait crime. Later that year, she was invited to attend the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics World Summer Games. In 2009, Hsu began attending the Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and Culture Forum, despite senior DPP officials having advised her against it. Hsu's party membership was suspended on 23 July 2009, and she was officially expelled four days later. Shortly after her expulsion, Hsu founded the People United Party. She attended the 2010 forum, and the following year declared her candidacy for the 2012 presidential election. Hsu eventually dropped out of the campaign. In 2013, she was again in attendance at the Cross-Strait forum. Hsu sought the presidency again in 2016, and received support from the Taiwan Progressive Party, National Health Service Alliance, and Zhongshan Party. Her candidacy was nullified in November, as the People United Party had not submitted its petition of signatures to the Central Election Commission by the deadline. Personal life Due to the events of the Kaohsiung Incident, Chang Chun-hung and Hsu Jung-shu have separated.

It is classified as a Coldwater Fishery and a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and has been home to trout and a diverse macroinvertebrate community. Course Nancy Run begins near the Green Pond Golf Course in Bethlehem Township. It flows southwest for several tenths of a mile before turning south-southwest for several tenths of a mile, crossing Easton Ave. The stream then receives an unnamed tributary from the left and turns west for some distance before entering the census-designated place of Middletown. It then turns south for a while before turning south- southwest and entering Freemansburg. Here, it turns south for a few tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with the Lehigh River.

History Nancy Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 30, 1990 due to its presence on a 1975 county highway map published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1211971. The stream is also known as Nancys Run. This variant name appears in a 1939 geological survey of Northampton County by Benjamin L. Miller et al.. Nancy Run was named for an old woman named Nancy who historically lived in a log cabin on the creek and was well known as a fortune teller. In the early 1800s, there was a large tavern on the stream. The community of Freemansburg, which is located at the mouth of the stream, was incorporated in 1856. Two steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridges carrying Washington Street and Keystone Street were built over Nancy Run near Freemansburg in 1930. In 1938, a concrete culvert bridge carrying State Route 3007 was constructed over the stream. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying Middletown Road was constructed over the creek in 1958, and in 1960, a prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying State Route 3007 was built over the creek. Three concrete culvert bridges were built over Nancy Run in 2000; one carried Tenth Street in Nancy Run Estates and the other two carried Bridge Lane and Washington Street in the Emerald Hills Development. In 2014, the Northampton County Conservation District received a $5000 grant from the Coldwater Heritage Partnership to develop a Coldwater Conservation Plan for the watershed of Nancy Run. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Nancy Run from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. Upstream of a State Route 3007 bridge, the creek's watershed is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Below this point, it is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The stream is designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters for brown trout in its lower . In the 1990s, Nancy Run was found to support a benthic ecosystem of high biodiversity, including one sensitive species. The stream also supported a number of fish species. However, a proposed highway extension was believed to potentially impact biodiversity by releasing organic and inorganic pollutants into the stream, although they would not have been directly impacted by the construction. Macroinvertebrate taxa found in Nancy Run in the 1970s include Oligochaeta, sowbugs, scuds, mayflies, caddisflies, beetles, Diptera (flies/midges), blackflies, and snails.

The Scorpions won the match by 54 runs, thus ending New South Wales' 10-year grip on the WNCL trophy. Patterson has been a member of the Adelaide Strikers' squad since its inaugural WBBL01 season (2015‚Äì16). Her run-out of Molly Strano of the Melbourne Renegades during the Strikers' opening match of its WBBL02 campaign has been described as one of the highlights of that campaign. In September 2018, Patterson achieved her maiden century for South Australia, by scoring a player-of-the- match-winning 109 off 131 balls in the Scorpions' opening round WNCL 2018‚Äì19 victory over the Western Fury.
