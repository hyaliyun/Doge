The term derives from the Atlantic Ocean that separates North America from Europe. The term can be used in a more limited way to imply support for North Atlantic military alliances or in a more expansive way implying broader cooperation, perceived deeply shared values, a merging of diplomatic cultures,Weisbrode, Kenneth. The Atlanticists.'' Nortia Press, 2017. and a sense of community and some degree of integration between North America and Europe. In practice, the philosophy of Atlanticism encourages active North American, particularly American, engagement in Europe and close cooperation between states on both sides of the ocean. Atlanticism manifested itself most strongly during the Second World War and in its aftermath, the Cold War, through the establishment of various euro-Atlantic institutions, most importantly NATO and the Marshall Plan. Atlanticism varies in strength from region to region and country to country based on a variety of historical and cultural factors. It is often considered to be particularly strong in eastern and central Europe and the United Kingdom (linked to the Special Relationship). Politically, it has tended to be associated most heavily and enthusiastically, but certainly not exclusively, with classical liberals or the political right in Europe. Atlanticism often implies an affinity for American political or social culture (or affinity for Europe in America) as well as the historical bonds between the two continents. There is some tension between Atlanticism and continentalism on both sides of the Atlantic, with some people emphasising increased regional cooperation or integration over trans-Atlantic cooperation. However, the relationship between Atlanticism and North American or European integration is complex, and they are not seen in direct opposition to one another by many commentators. Internationalism is the foreign policy belief combining both Atlanticism and continentalism. The relative decline of European power in the world, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the spread of Atlanticist norms outside of the North Atlantic region have decreased the strength of Atlanticist thought since the end of the Cold War. Other international relationships have been increasingly emphasised, although the trans-Atlantic relationship is still arguably the most important in the world.  History  Ronald Reagan speaking in Berlin, 1987 (\\"Tear down this wall!\\") with Helmut Kohl, Chancellor of Germany. Reagan was a committed Atlanticist.Prior to the World Wars, western European countries were generally preoccupied with continental concerns and creating colonial empires in Africa and Asia, and not relations with North America. Likewise, the United States was busy with domestic issues and interventions in Latin America, but had little interest in European affairs, and Canada, despite gaining self- governing dominion status through Confederation in 1867, had yet to exercise full foreign policy independence as a part of the British Empire. The experience of having American and Canadian troops fighting with British, French, and other Europeans in Europe during the World Wars fundamentally changed this situation. Though the US (and to some extent Canada) adopted a more isolationist position between the wars, by the time of the Normandy landings the Allies were well integrated on all policies. The Atlantic Charter of 1941 declared by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill established the goals of the Allies for the post- war world, and was later adopted by all the Western allies. Following the Second World War, the Western European countries were anxious to convince the US to remain engaged in European affairs to deter any possible aggression by the Soviet Union. This led to the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty which established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the main institutional consequence of Atlanticism, which binds all members to defend the others, and led to the long-term garrisoning of American and Canadian troops in Western Europe. After the end of the Cold War, the relationship between the United States and Europe changed fundamentally, and made both sides less-interested in the other. Without the threat of the Soviet Union dominating Europe, the continent became much less of a military priority for the US, and likewise, Europe no longer felt as much need for military protection from the US. As a result, the relationship lost much of its strategic importance. However, the new democracies of the former Warsaw Pact, and most of the fragments of the fractured Yugoslavia, took a different view, eagerly embracing Atlanticism, as a bulwark against their continued fear of the Soviet Union's key now-separate superpower fragment: Russia.Asmus, Ronald D. and Alexandr Vondra: \\"The Origins of Atlanticism in Central and Eastern Europe,\\" July, 2005 Cambridge Review of International Affairs Volume 18, Number 2, Centre of International Studies, ISSN 0955-7571 print / ISSN 1474-449X, retrieved June 8, 2020 from Pittsburg State University.Schmitz-Robinson, Elizabeth: \\"Kindred Spirit or Opportunistic Ally?

Some commentators, such as Robert Kagan and Ivo Daalder questioned whether Europe and the United States had diverged to such a degree that their alliance was no longer relevant.Daalder, Ivo H.: \\"The End of Atlanticism,\\" June 1, 2003, Brookings Institution, retrieved June 8, 2020 Ideology Atlanticism is a belief in the necessity of cooperation between North America and Europe. The term can imply a belief that the bilateral relationship between Europe and the United States is important above all others, including intra-European cooperation, especially when it comes to security issues. The term can also be used \\"as a shorthand for the transatlantic security architecture.\\" Supranational integration of the North Atlantic area had emerged as a focus of thinking among intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic already in the late 19th century. Although it was not known as Atlanticism at the time (the term was coined in 1950), they developed an approach coupling soft and hard power which would to some extent integrate the two sides of the Atlantic. The idea of an attractive \\"nucleus\\" union was the greatest soft power element; the empirical fact of the hegemonic global strength such a union would hold was the hard power element. This approach was eventually implemented to a certain degree in the form of NATO, the G7 grouping and other Atlanticist institutions. In the long debate between Atlanticism and its critics in the 20th century, the main argument was whether deep and formal Atlantic integration would serve to attract those still outside to seek to join, as Atlanticists argued, or alienate the rest of the world and drive them into opposite alliances. Realists, neutralists, and pacifists, nationalists and globalists tended to believe it would do the latter, citing the Warsaw Pact as the proof of their views and treating it as the inevitable realpolitik counterpart of NATO. Broadly speaking, Atlanticism is particularly strong in Britain (linked to the Special Relationship) and eastern and central Europe (i.e. the area between Germany and Russia). There are numerous reasons for its strength in Eastern Europe, primarily the role of the United States in bringing political freedom there after the First World War, the role of the US in defeating Nazi Germany (which occupied the region) during the Second World War, its leading role during the Cold War, its relative enthusiasm for bringing the countries of the region into Atlanticist institutions such as NATO, and a suspicion of the intentions of the major Western European powers. Countries such as Denmark, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom are among those who generally hold strong Atlanticist views, while Germany tends to promote continentalist views and a strong European Union.\\"The new kids on the block,\\" The Economist, 2007-01-04. Retrieved 2007-10-14. Quote: \\"Romania, under its president, Traian Basescu, is a bastion of Atlanticism in the Black Sea region.\\" In the early 21st century, Atlanticism has tended to be slightly stronger on the political right in Europe (although many variations do exist from country to country), but on the political center-left in the United States. The partisan division should not be overstated, but it exists and has grown since the end of the Cold War. While trans-Atlantic trade and political ties have remained mostly strong throughout the Cold War and beyond, the larger trend has been continentalist economic integration with the European Union (and its regional partners) and the North American Free Trade Agreement notably dividing the Atlantic region into two rival trade blocs. However, many political actors and commentators do not see the two processes as being necessarily opposed to one another, in fact some commentators believe regional integration can reinforce Atlanticism. Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, added by Canada, also attempted to bind the nations together on economic and political fronts. Institutions The North Atlantic Council is the premier, governmental forum for discussion and decision-making in an Atlanticist context. Other organizations that can be considered Atlanticist in origin: * NATO * Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) * G-6/7/8 * North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) * Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are also considered Atlanticist.

Located one hour west of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario, Renfrew is the third largest town in the county after Petawawa and Pembroke. The town is a small transportation hub connecting Highway 60 and Highway 132 with the Trans-Canada Highway. Renfrew is also known historically for its role in the formation of the National Hockey League. It lies about 5 kilometres from the Quebec border, about 10 kilometres by road. Renfrew makes most of Canada‚Äôs hockey tape. History Named after Renfrewshire, Scotland, in approximately 1848, Renfrew was settled largely in part due to logging in the area in the early 19th century, where the river was used in order to drive the lumber to locations such as Ottawa. This heritage was until recently celebrated every July with the Lumber Baron Festival. Geography Renfrew and the surrounding Township of Horton are at the intersection of the Bonnechere River and the Ottawa River in the Ottawa Valley. Renfrew is at the intersection of provincial Highway 17, Highway 60, and Highway 132.  Climate  Renfrew has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) with four distinct seasons, warm summers, cold snowy winters and no dry season. Demographics Population:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006 census First Language: * English: 91.8% * French: 4.0% * English and French: 0.5% * Other: 3.7% Economy Historic Customs Building, now Renfrew's Post Office Much of Renfrew's current prosperity can be attributed to its status as an economic centre for a surrounding rural region with a population of over 30,000. Renfrew is also an important stop for Ottawa-based cottagers and outdoor enthusiasts passing by on their way to nearby whitewater rafting, boating, camping, hunting, golfing, fishing, snowmobiling, down-hill skiing, and cross-country skiing. However, the area's largest single employers are the Renfrew Victoria Hospital and the Bonnechere Manor.Renfrew County Fact Sheet ‚Äì Renfrew In addition to numerous small employers, there are also several manufacturing facilities employing several hundred people; Scapa Tapes Renfrew (formerly Renfrew Tape) makes products such as hockey tape that is used across North America and the duct tape brand featured on the discontinued Red Green Show and promoted by Doug Gilmour in the early 1990s after becoming a member of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Times Fibre Canada and Madawaska Hardwood Flooring also have manufacturing facilities in town. Haley Industries located outside Renfrew near Haley Station is also a major employer in the area. Renfrew is also home to many successful small businesses. Between 2000 and 2005, a major portion of Renfrew's retail business, and the associated customer services jobs, shifted from the west-end Renfrew mall (now demolished) to its east-end industrial park near Highway 17 due to the opening of several major big-box such as No Frills and Walmart and smaller retail stores. Residents of the area await the twinning of Highway 17 to improve traffic flow and the safety of the highway due to numerous accidents along the corridor to North Bay, Ontario. Despite the apparent prosperity, Statistics Canada reported the average earnings of Renfrew residents in 2000 as $35,811, or roughly 31% lower than the provincial average and 5% lower than the county average.Statistics Canada Community Profile - Renfrew - 2001 Further, the town reports, relative to the population size and compared to the province as a whole, fewer positions in management, business, finance, administration and natural or applied sciences, while there was greater than the provincial rates of occupation in sales and service, trades, transport and equipment operators, processing, manufacturing and utilities.

Landmarks=Low Square= Cenotaph located in Low Square Low Square is located on Raglan Street in downtown Renfrew. The square is a park setting containing the cenotaph, and the Town Hall. The land was donated by the Honourable Thomas Low as a gift to the city for the purpose of constructing a cenotaph to honour local soldiers who died in The Great War. The Renfrew Police station (later the OPP detachment) was built on the back of the square in 1972, with a new town hall constructed in the 1980s. The police moved out of this building in February 2017 to a new location at 450 O'Brien Road. =McDougall Mill Museum= The McDougall Mill Museum on the Bonnechere River John Lorn McDougall, politician and fur trader, built the mill in 1855 by the Bonnechere River near the town landmark Swinging Bridge and overlooking natural rapids below the Renfrew Power Generation generating station. It has been converted into a museum, sometimes referred to as 'Renfrew Museum', not to be confused with museums of that name in Pennsylvania and Scotland. The McDougall Mill Museum houses pioneer tools and machinery, a military section, a doll exhibit, as well as toys, Victorian clothing and household items.Ottawa Valley Guide: McDougall Mill. Retrieved 21 August 2007. =Swinging Bridge= Renfrew Fire Department In 1885, the W.H. Kearney family built a wire bridge across the Bonnechere River.

The elegantly decorated town landmark was converted from a live theatre to a movie theatre and 1990s upgrades modified the balcony to accommodate a second screen. The building still maintaining much of the original appeal, reopened after extensive renovations, on January 7, 1994 with Mrs. Doubtfire, starring Robin Williams.

By 1912, bed capacity rose to 30 and the Renfrew Victoria Hospital became a Public General Hospital. In January 1926, a tragic fire destroyed the original building, which was replaced by a new 50 bed hospital later that year. The Hospital was under Municipal ownership until 1961 when a special act of parliament transferred it from civic authority to an independent corporation known as the Board of Governors, composed of representatives from the Town of Renfrew and surrounding Townships. In October 1963, the hospital grew to 101 treatment beds after a major building and renovation program. In November 1978 another renovation project took place which was completed in April 1980. A new Dialysis Unit serving Renfrew County was completed in 1994, able to accommodate the needs of 48 patients. This Unit was again expanded in 1999 with an addition to the Hospital. In November 2001, a new Emergency/Ambulatory Care wing was opened, adding 13,000 square feet to the existing hospital, then in March 2015 a 23,000 square foot Nephrology Centre was completed. This consolidated every aspect of patient's care for kidneys - education, clinics and treatment - in the same area of the hospital. The Victoria Hospital School of Nursing opened in 1902 with a capacity of 30 students, graduating 10 students per year. Nursing education moved under the jurisdiction of community colleges and the school was subsequently closed in 1965. =Policing= The Town of Renfrew is policed by the Ontario Provincial Police force. Chief Bernard \\"Barney\\" McDermott had the job as Chief of Police in Renfrew from 1890 until his retirement in 1909 - he was a one man police force and was known to always \\"get his man\\". His living quarters were situated above the fire hall in Renfrew. The Renfrew Police station (later the OPP detachment) was built on the back of Low Square in 1972. The OPP operated out of their Stewart Street location from 1967 until moving into the Low Square detachment when the Town of Renfrew police service amalgamated with the OPP in 2000. The Renfrew and Arnprior detachments, who both faced the same fate of losing their own town operated forces, had their OPP detachments amalgamated in January 2013, and in February 2017, a new regional detachment was opened at 450 O'Brien Road in Renfrew. This new Renfrew detachment serves the towns of Arnprior, Renfrew, and the townships of Greater Madawaska, McNab-Braeside, Admaston-Bromley, Horton and about half of Whitewater Region Township. =Public Library= The Renfrew Public Library had rather simple beginnings; a group of residents discussing the latest philosophies and varied topics in William Dickson's cobbler shop which opened up in 1845 near the current location of the post office. After gathering up a few books in 1852, Mr. Dickson, Mr. Archie Thompson, and local lawyer, Mr. Elkanah Billings formed the Renfrew Mechanics Institute and Library Association, which lasted for about fifteen years before being revitalized in 1870 by a new group of people. By the end of the century, the Institute emerged as a newly formed Public Library Board and the books were moved to the Barnet Block at 282 Raglan Street, above what was James Clark's drugstore. The current building located at 13 Railway Avenue, was opened in 1920 with financial support from the Carnegie Institute, and in 1959, the Children's Library was established in the completely renovated basement. In the 1980s, the library became wheelchair accessible by an addition at the east and south side of the building, which also expanded the research and reading area into the second floor of the adjacent building at 161 Raglan Street. Sports=Facilities= The town's main sports complex, Ma-te-way Centre was built in 1989 replacing the ageing Renfrew Arena. =Golf= The Renfrew Golf Club was founded in 1929, as nine holes, and was expanded to 18 holes in the mid-1970s. =Hockey= One of the four original teams in the National Hockey Association, the precursor to the NHL, was based in Renfrew. The Renfrew Creamery Kings sought to be allowed to play in the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association, but with no success. The team's owner, M. J. O'Brien, eventually financed and put together his own league, the NHA. The Creamery Kings played two seasons of hockey in the NHA, 1911 and 1912, until M. J. O'Brien pulled out to pursue his interests in the railway. Renfrew Timberwolves is the town's hockey team since 1987, but the team can trace its roots back to 1968 as the Renfrew Lions or Renfrew Junior Timberwolves. The current team plays in the Central Canada Hockey League Tier 2.

The weapon was planned to be used to bombard London from two large bunkers in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France, but they were rendered unusable by Allied bombing raids before completion. Two similar guns were used to bombard Luxembourg from December 1944 to February 1945. The V-3 was also known as the Hochdruckpumpe (\\"High Pressure Pump,\\" HDP for short), which was a code name intended to hide the real purpose of the project. It was also known as Flei√üiges Lieschen (\\"Busy Lizzie\\"). (bottom of page) Description The gun used multiple propellant charges placed along the barrel's length and timed to fire as soon as the projectile passed them in order to provide an additional boost. Solid-fuel rocket boosters were used instead of explosive charges because of their greater suitability and ease of use. These were arranged in symmetrical pairs along the length of the barrel, angled to project their thrust against the base of the projectile as it passed. This layout spawned the German codename Tausendf√º√üler (\\"millipede\\"). The barrel and side chambers were designed as identical sections to simplify production and allow damaged sections to be replaced. The entire gun would use multiple such sections bolted together. The smoothbore gun fired a fin- stabilized shell that depended upon aerodynamic forces rather than gyroscopic forces to prevent tumbling (distinct from conventional rifled weapons which cause the projectile to spin); this resulted in a lower drag coefficient. Background The origin of the multi-chamber gun dates back to the 19th century. In 1857, U.S. inventor Azel Storrs Lyman (1815‚Äì1885) was granted a patent on \\"Improvement in accelerating fire-arms\\", and he built a prototype in 1860 which proved to be unsuccessful. Lyman then modified the design in collaboration with James Richard Haskell, who had been working for years on the same principle. Haskell and Lyman reasoned that subsidiary propellant charges could increase the muzzle velocity of a projectile if the charges were spaced at intervals along the barrel of a gun in side chambers and ignited an instant after a shell had passed them. The \\"Lyman-Haskell multi-charge gun\\" was constructed on the instructions of the U.S. Army's Chief of Ordnance, but it did not resemble a conventional artillery piece. The barrel was so long that it had to be placed on an inclined ramp, and it had pairs of chambers angled back at 45 degrees discharging into it. It was test fired at the Frankford Arsenal at Philadelphia in 1880 and was unsuccessful. The flash from the original propellant charge bypassed the projectile due to faulty obturation and prematurely ignited the subsidiary charges before the shell passed them, slowing the shell down. The best velocity that could be obtained from it was , inferior to the performance of a conventional RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun of the same period. New prototypes of multi-charge guns were built and tested, but Lyman and Haskell abandoned the idea. During the same period, French engineer Louis-Guillaume Perreaux, one of the pioneers of the motorcycle, had been working on a similar project since before 1860. Perreaux was granted a patent in 1864 for a multi-chamber gun. In 1878, Perreaux presented his invention at the World Exhibition of Paris. Development In 1918, the French Army made plans for a very long range multi-chamber gun in response to the German Paris Gun. The Paris Gun was built by Friedrich Krupp AG and could bombard Paris from German lines over a distance of no less than . The French initiative did not reach the prototype stage, as it was discontinued when the retreat of the German armies and the armistice put an end to the bombardment. The plans for the multi-chamber gun were archived, as they had been envisioned to counter the German fire.In 1938, a Czech named Tugendhat rediscovered the concept and tried to sell his \\"Multiplex Gun\\" proposal to the British, but they turned him down. (). France collapsed in June 1940 at the beginning of World War II, and German troops acquired the plans of this long-range gun. In 1942, this patent attracted the attention of August C√∂nders,August C√∂nders is often incorrectly considered the inventor of the multi-chamber gun. developer of the R√∂chling shell and chief engineer of the plants \\"R√∂chling Stahlwerk AG\\" in Wetzlar, Germany. C√∂nders thought that the gradual acceleration of the shell by a series of small charges spread over the length of the barrel might be the solution to the problem of designing very long range guns. The very strong explosive charge needed to project shells at a high speed was causing very rapid degradation of the gun tubes of conventional guns.For example, in 1918, the tube of the Paris Gun needed to be changed after only 65 shots. Moreover, the shells had to be made in progressively larger diameter to compensate for wear of the tube, and were numbered from 1 to 65 to be used in the correct order. () C√∂nders proposed the use of electrically activated charges to eliminate the problem of the premature ignition of the subsidiary charges, the problem experienced by the Lyman-Haskell gun. C√∂nders built a prototype of a 20 mm multi-chamber gun using machinery readily available at the Wetzlar plant, machinery that was producing tubes of this calibre for the Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns of 20 mm. The first tests were encouraging, but to get the support of the Ministry of arms, Hermann R√∂chling had to present to Albert Speer C√∂nders' project of a cannon capable of firing on London from the coast of the Pas-de-Calais. The project intended to use two batteries to crush London under a barrage of hundreds of shells per hour, shells of with an explosive charge of . Speer told Adolf Hitler about the proposal in May 1943. After the Royal Air Force (RAF) bombed the Peenem√ºnde rocket center on 17 August, Hitler agreed to Speer's suggestion that the gun be built without more tests. C√∂nders constructed a full-calibre gun at the Hillersleben proving ground near Magdeburg but, by the end of 1943, he had encountered severe problems both in putting the gun's basic principle into operation and in producing a feasible design for the shells that it was to fire. Even when everything worked, the muzzle velocity was just over , which was nowhere near what had been promised. Nonetheless, a proposal was made to build a single full-sized gun with a barrel at Misdroy on the Baltic island of Wolin, near Peenem√ºnde, while construction went ahead at the Mimoyecques site in France (which had already been attacked by the USAAF and the RAF). The Heereswaffenamt (Weapon Procurement Office) took control of the project by March 1944, with no good news from Misdroy, and C√∂nders became one of the engineers working on the three chief problems: projectile design, obturation, and ignition of the secondary charges. Two US Army soldiers with a captured Sprenggranate 4481 projectile, which would have been fired from the V-3 at a rate of 1 every 6 seconds. Six different companies produced satisfactory designs for projectiles, including Krupp and ≈†koda Works. Obturation problems were solved by placing a sealing piston between the projectile and the initial propellant charge, which in turn prevented the flash from the charge from getting ahead of the projectile and solved the problem of controlling the initiation of the secondary charges. By the end of May 1944, there were four designs for the 150 mm finned projectile, one manufactured by Fasterstoff (designed by F√ºstenberg) and three others by R√∂chling (C√∂nders), Bochumer (Verein-Haack), and Witkowitz Ironworks (Athem). Trials were held at Misdroy from 20‚Äì24 May 1944 with ranges of up to being attained. On 4 July 1944, the Misdroy gun was test-fired with 8 rounds (one of the long shells travelled ). The gun burst during the testing, putting an end to the tests. Mimoyecques site Reconstructed plan of the site Major Bock of Festung Pioneer-Stab 27 (the fortification regiment of LVII Corps, Fifteenth Army, at the time based in the Dieppe area) was given the task of finding a suitable site for the HDP batteries following Hitler's decision that HDP guns should be sited in northern France to bombard London. A study in early 1943 concluded that a hill with a rock core would be most suitable, as the gun tubes could be placed in drifts (inclined tunnels) and support equipment and supplies located in adjacent tunnels. The guns would not be movable and would be permanently aimed at London. A suitable site was selected at a limestone hill about north of the Hidrequent quarries, near Mimoyecques in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France behind Cap Gris Nez, very close to the French end of the present day Channel tunnel, where V-1 and V-2 launch sites were already under construction. The site was from the sea and from London. It was code-named Wiese (meadow) and Bauvorhaben 711 (Construction Project 711), and Organisation Todt began construction in September 1943 with the building of railway lines to support the work, and began to excavate the gun shafts in October. The initial layout comprised two parallel facilities approximately apart, each with five drifts which were to hold a stacked cluster of five HDP gun tubes, for a total of 50 guns. Both facilities were served by an underground railway tunnel and underground ammunition storage galleries. The eastern complex consisted of five drifts angled at 50 degrees reaching below the hilltop. The five drifts exited the hilltop through a concrete slab wide and thick. Large steel plates protected the five openings and each drift had a special armoured door. Extensive tunnels and elevator shafts supported the guns and, if the site had become operational, about 1,000 troops from Artillerie Abteilung 705 and supporting units would have been deployed at Mimoyecques. Artillerie Abteilung 705 had been organised in January 1944 under Oberstleutnant Georg Borttscheller to operate the Wiese gun complex. The plans were to have the first battery of five gun tubes ready for March 1944, and the full complex of 25 gun tubes by 1 October 1944. A failure occurred at the Misdroy proving ground in April 1944 after only 25 rounds had been fired and, as a result, the project was further cut back from five drifts to three, even though work had begun on some of the other drifts. The site was finally put out of commission on 6 July 1944, when bombers of RAF Bomber Command's 617 Squadron (the famous \\"Dambusters\\") attacked using \\"Tallboy\\" deep-penetration bombs. Luxembourg bombardment The project eventually came under the control of the SS, and SS General Hans Kammler ordered it to be ready for action in late 1944, assisted by Walter Dornberger. A battery was constructed of two shorter V-3 guns approximately long with 12 side-chambers, and it was placed in the hands of the army artillery unit Artillerie Abteilung 705 under the command of Hauptmann (Captain) Patzig. These were sited in a wooded ravine of the Ruwer River at Lampaden about southeast of Trier in Germany. The two guns were aimed west, resting on 13 steel support structures on solid wooden bases on a 34 degree slope. The city of Luxembourg (which had been liberated in September 1944) was at a range of about and was designated Target No. 305. Concrete blockhouses were constructed between the two gun tubes, as well as ten smaller bunkers to hold projectiles and propellant charges. The assembly and mounting of the Lampaden guns coincided with the final preparations for the Battle of the Bulge. The supply of ammunition became problematic due to the state of the German railway network. Time had become critical, and it was decided to use a finned projectile with a discarding sabot, weighing and carrying a explosive charge. The propellant comprised a main charge and 24 subsidiary charges for a total of . By the time that the Ardennes offensive began on 16 December 1944, Kammler received orders from OB West (German Army Command in the West) to begin firing at the end of the month, and the first gun tube was ready for action on 30 December 1944. Two warm-up rounds were initially fired, followed by five high-explosive shells which were fired in sequence, attended by Kammler. The muzzle velocity was approximately . The second gun tube was brought into operation on 11 January 1945 and 183 rounds in total were fired until 22 February 1945, with 44 confirmed hits in the urban area. From the 142 rounds that struck Luxembourg, total casualties were 10 dead and 35 wounded. Fate One of the two Lampaden guns was dismantled on 15 February, and firing ceased on 22 February, when US Army units had advanced to within of the Lampaden site. A second battery of guns began to be deployed in January 1945 at Buhl, aimed at Belfort in support of the Operation Nordwind offensive. One gun was erected before the failure of the Nordwind offensive put the site at risk, and the equipment was removed before firing could begin. There were other proposals to deploy batteries to bombard London, Paris, Antwerp and other cities but these were not implemented due to the poor state of the German railway network and a lack of ammunition. All four HDP guns were eventually abandoned at the R√∂chling works in Wetzlar and Artillerie Abteilung 705 was re-equipped with conventional artillery. The disassembled gun tubes, spare parts, and remaining ammunition were later captured by the US Army and shipped to the United States where they were tested and evaluated at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and scrapped there in 1948. V-3 museum The Mimoyecques museum allows visitors to view the galleries (in various stages of construction and bombing damage), remains of the guns, a small scale V-3 replica, and examples of machinery, rail systems and tools employed. The site also contains memorials to the slave labourers who were forced by the Nazis to construct it NOTE: The length of the V-3 cannon at Mimoyecques surpassed the Schwerer Gustav (Dora) 800 mm super-cannon, the M√∂rser Karl (Ger√§t 040) 600 mm tracked siege mortar, and the Leopold and Robert 320 mm railway cannons. and to the airmen killed in action during the destruction of the base. The Misdroy site also has a museum. Scale model of V-3 gun Hugh Hunt of Cambridge University, together with explosives engineer Charlie Adcock created a working scale model of the V-3 gun and was able to prove the ignition of the propellants was done by the advancing gas behind the projectile.

Whitewater Region is made up of the former municipalities of Beachburg, Cobden, Ross and Westmeath, which were amalgamated into the current township on January 1, 2001. Whitewater Region is named after the stretch of world-famous whitewater on the Ottawa River, popular for rafting and kayaking. This section is part of the Ottawa River Provincial Park. The township also claims a distinctive place in Canada's history. An astrolabe bearing the date 1613 and believed to have belonged to Samuel de Champlain was discovered within the township. A monument commemorating this historic site is located just outside Cobden on Highway 17. Communities The township comprises the communities of: Beachburg, Chenaux, Cobden, Finchley, Foresters Falls, Garden of Eden, The Glen, Grants Settlement, Haley Station, Kerr Line, La Passe, Ledgerwoods Corner, McLaren's Settlement, Meath, Millars Corner, Perretton, Pleasant Valley, Queens Line, Rocher Fendu, Shields Crossing, Snake River and Westmeath. =Beachburg= Beachburg Beachburg () is one of the larger population centres in the Whitewater Region, having a variety of stores and restaurants, an arena, several halls, a public elementary school and a public library. It was founded by and named after David Beach and became a stop along the Canadian Northern Railway line with a station and grain elevators. In 1853, the entire village, except for two houses, was destroyed by fire. By 1869, Beachburg was a village with a population of 250 in Westmeath County, Renfrew. There were stages to Pembroke and Sand Point. The average price for land was $8.The province of Ontario gazetteer and directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869 Beachburg was devastated by a fire in 1931, destroying the station, the grain elevators, and the Main Hall and Dining Hall of the Exhibition Park. In 1959, the Village of Beachburg was separated from Westmeath Township and incorporated. =CobdenForesters Falls= Foresters Falls () was founded in the early 1840s by Oliver Forester, a prominent pioneer who was the community's first postmaster. By the 1870s the community had three stores, a grist mill, and a sawmill, all of which were destroyed in a fire later that same year. Foresters Falls is now a small community having regressed since the invention of motorized transport. Attractions include the Ross Township Museum that is located in the heart of Foresters Falls.Kennedy, Clyde C. Upper Ottawa Valley: Glimpse of History. Pembroke, Ont.: Renfrew County Council, 1970. =Haley Station= Haley Station (also known as Haley, Haleys, Haley's, with or without Station)() derives its name from a station built on the Canadian Pacific Railway(CPR) where the railway right of way crossed the farm of George Haley, an early settler on the second concession of Ross township (now part of Whitewater township). Haley Station once boasted a blacksmith shop, a general store, two churches (United Church and Free Methodist), two service stations, a railway station and an Orange Hall. With the advent of the automobile, people found it more convenient to go to Renfrew. Of the establishments mentioned, only the United Church remains in operation. =McLaren's Settlement= McLaren's Settlement () originated in the 1840s when members of the McLaren family came to the area from Scotland. It was located a short distance upstream from the present Ontario Power Generation (OPG0 Cheneaux Generating Station. The McLarens arrived during the peak of the lumbering industry in the Ottawa Valley, and one of their number constructed a timber slide in the Ottawa River to facilitate the movement of squared timber rafts past the Cheneaux Rapids. These slides could be described as a sluice about wide and about long and steeply sloped through which some river water was diverted. Floating bundles of about 25 pieces of squared timber would be steered toward the upper end of the slide. Once into the sluice, the bundle of timber would descend at a great speed, emerging undamaged into the river below the rapids. History=Founding and development= Much of the early development in Renfrew County is largely a circumstance of location. As Pembroke and Ottawa grew, so did the gap between them. In the 19th century, the easiest route between the two was the Ottawa River. However, the presence of rapids near Portage-du-Fort necessitated a land route. At this time the area was mostly a vast forest untouched by Europeans. A few settlers had put down near Muskrat Lake, but for the most part there had been little activity since Champlain's visit in the 17th century. In 1849 Jason Gould built a road from what came to be called Goulds Landing to what would become Cobden on Muskrat Lake. One could catch a steamer down the lake and then go on by road to Pembroke. The traffic on the road could not help but cause growth. In 1850 Gould built a post office and named the fledgling settlement Cobden after Richard Cobden, a member of the British Parliament whom Gould admired. By October 2, 1876, the railway had reached Cobden. The community started to expand from the lake towards the railway station further inland. Main Street began to take shape: the Cobden Sun, the Bank of Ottawa, blacksmith shops, a bakery, a general store, a mill, a surgeon and a jewelry store were all located in the community. In 1880 a public school was opened to accommodate the strain on nearby S.S. No 1\\\\. Cobden was soon the biggest community in Ross Township and became an incorporated village in October 1901. Cobden has been the victim of many fires, which have destroyed almost all the original buildings. Main Street has suffered worst from fire, including one in 1913 which destroyed the Cobden Sun building and many historical records. A hydro-electric dam began operating at the falls south of Cobden. It supplied the town, off and on, with power until it was destroyed on April 12, 1934 in a raging flood. Large blocks of ice ripped the dam apart and poured over Highway 17, tearing away sections of pavement. The plant operator, Bill Wall, was stranded in the upper section of his house until flooding subsided. The town then started receiving power from a station in Calabogie. Council elections in 1949 were dominated by the issue of whether to hold another plebiscite on establishing a waterworks system. A previous plebiscite had come out 82‚Äì56 against. But times were changing quickly‚Äîafter the war a new council was elected and the next vote was 124‚Äì46 in favour and by the early 1950s Cobden had water. The waterworks system required constant maintenance until a major retooling in the 1980s. The visibly dominating water tower was built in 1988 replacing the original (built in 1951). A bigger school was needed by 1903. The present-day school, Cobden District Public, was built in 1938 and served initially as a high school until Opeongo High School was built. =The Astrolabe= In 1613, French explorer Samuel de Champlain, traveled through an area very near Cobden while exploring the Ottawa River. Due to the Chenaux Rapids, Champlain and his men were forced to portage. They presumably took shore in Browns Bay near present-day McKenzie's Hill. In 1953 a large rock was found in this area bearing a chiseled inscription. Though the inscription was hard to read it was determined that it said \\"Champlain Juin 2, 1613\\". Champlain's trail from this point is debatable. He may have cut straight across land to the southern tip of Jeffreys Lake, or he may have veered south skirting the far side of what later came to be known as the Champlain Trail Lakes. It is known that he eventually made his way to Green Lake and at this point, according to several 17th-century authors, Champlain lost his astrolabe. It remained there for 254 years, until it was found in 1867 by Edward George Lee, a 14-year-old farm boy helping his father clear trees near Green Lake (now Astrolabe Lake). Lee gave the astrolabe to Captain Comley, a steamboat captain on Muskrat Lake but never received the ten dollars Cowley promised him. Cowley sold the astrolabe to his employer, R.W. Cassels of the Ottawa Forwarding Company. The astrolabe eventually passed to Samuel V. Hoffman of the New York Historical Society in 1942, remaining there for 47 years until it was acquired by the Canadian Museum of Civilization in 1989. In 1990 a special celebration was held in Cobden in honour of the astrolabe's return. Culture The Cobden Farmers' Market, first organized in 1991, is an outdoor market that runs from May to October. It offers a variety of crafts and foodstuffs; everything must be grown or handmade locally. The market has recently moved from the Memorial Hall grounds to the Fair Grounds, but the Christmas Market, the grande finale for the year, is held in the Ag Hall, also on the Fair Grounds. Overlooking Muskrat Lake, Cobden Park occupies what is thought to be the spot where Champlain met the Native Chief Nibachis. A plaque was erected in the 1960s commemorating this event. The lands for the park were donated by Thomas Robinson and his wife in 1904. In 1988 extensive work was carried out on the beach portion of the park by the Civitans. Logos Land is a religious-based water park. Built on the site of the Astrolabe's discovery, Logos Land features five water slides, paddle boats, mini-golf and a representation of Noah's Ark which holds a souvenir shop and \\"The Ark\\" restaurant. It is also home to Canada's tallest Christmas tree standing high. Every year over 3000 local children get together to decorate the tree, which is dedicated to children around the world. Mussie is a likely mythical Nessie-like creature said to reside in Muskrat Lake. Ottawa Valley Pentecostal Camp (OVPC) is a Christian-based family and children's camp at the foot of Muskrat Lake. It has hosted many local community events with its year round facilities. OVPC is owned and operated by the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada. Storyland once featured 200 animated characters set in 40 different fairy tale scenes surrounded by a natural woodland environment. Though the park has fallen into disrepair, it still features two large playgrounds, paddleboats, mini-golf and picnic areas. The Champlain Lookout offers a panoramic view of the Ottawa River. Transportation The only provincial highway serving the township directly is Highway 17, the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway through Ontario. The planned extension of Highway 417 to Petawawa will see the highway largely rerouted onto a new alignment through Whitewater Region. Home to The Champlain Flying Club, the Cobden/Bruce McPhail Memorial Airport is located on Highway 17. Municipal council The municipal council sits in Cobden. It consists of Mayor Michael Moore, Reeve Cathy Regier, and Councillors Chris Olmstead, Charlene Jackson, Daryl McLaughlin, Dave MacKay and Neil Nicholson. DemographicsNotable people Cobden is the hometown of Susie Laska, former professional hockey player for the NWHL and Robert Wellington Mayhew, the first Canadian ambassador to Japan. Westmeath is the birthplace of D. Allan Bromley, physicist, academic, and Science Adviser to former President of the United States, George H. W. Bush.

Location General view of the town, c. 1860 Porthmawr Gate c. 1800 The town lies on the River Usk, on the southern edge of the Black Mountains and in the eastern part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. Significant parts of the surrounding countryside, over form part of the Glanusk Park estate. History The name Crickhowell is derived from that of a nearby Iron Age hill fort called Crug Hywel; the Welsh language name being anglicised by map-makers and local English-speaking people. The town Crickhowell Castle. From a survey in the beginning of the 6th century by James Basire Detail of Crickhowell Bridge Public services in Crickhowell are provided by Powys County Council and to a lesser extent by Crickhowell Town Council. Planning matters fall to the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority. There is a primary school and a secondary school; both act as a central point for a large catchment area. There is some light industry on the outskirts of Crickhowell at the Elvicta Industrial Estate. The town centre includes a variety of traditional businesses, many of which are family owned. Other facilities in Crickhowell include a library, two play areas, public toilets and the CRiC building, which houses a tourist information centre, an internet cafe, an art gallery and a local history archive. There are pubs, cafes, restaurants and two hotels: \\"The Bear\\" and \\"The Dragon\\". The churches in Crickhowell include St Edmund's Church which holds a service every Sunday, a Baptist church, an evangelical church and a Catholic church. In 2015, Crickhowell appeared in a TV documentary, claiming it as the first British settlement to purposely use similar tax avoidance tactics used by multinational businesses to avoid paying taxes themselves, in protest at the way large corporations use legal loopholes to avoid paying UK corporation tax. A market and fair have been recorded since 1281. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes The Vale of Grwyney community and has a total population of 2,801 as taken at the 2011 census. The current councillor is John Morris, a Liberal Democrat. Tourism Today, Crickhowell is a popular tourist destination. In 2005 a Tourist Information centre was built in the centre of town and during summer the town is notably busier. Most people visit Crickhowell to see the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons, and maybe enjoy some mountain-biking, camping, hillwalking, rock climbing, fly-fishing, hang-gliding, caravanning or simply tour the area by car staying at Bed-and-breakfasts. The Green Man Festival takes place annually in mid- August at nearby Glanusk Park. Notable buildings Notable features in Crickhowell include the seventeenth-century stone bridge over the River Usk with its odd arches (twelve on one side, thirteen on the other) and its seat built into the walls, the 14th-century parish church of St Edmund, and the ruins of Crickhowell Castle on the green \\"tump\\" set backfrom the A40 Brecon to Abergavenny road. =Market Hall= Crickhowell's Market Hall (originally the Town Hall) on The Square dates from 1834, nowadays with market stalls on the ground floor and a cafe in the first floor old courtroom.

Schools Crickhowell has two schools; Crickhowell Community Primary School and a secondary school called Crickhowell High School, which has approximately 700 pupils. Notable people George Everest, after whom Mount Everest is named, may have been born near Crickhowell. His father had an estate there called \\"Gwernvale Manor\\".\\"George Everest was born on 4 July 1790 but the location is open to doubt. This uncertainty as to his birthplace arises because his father William Tristram Everest had an estate near Crickhowell in South Wales and some reference works suggest he was born there. [...] George's baptismal certificate certainly indicates that he was baptized in Greenwich but although the certificate also bears his date of birth it does not indicate the locality.\\" This is now a hotel, known simply as 'The Manor'.) There is also a street in Crickhowell named after him (Everest Drive). The current Lord and Lady of the Manor of Gwernvale are Stephen and Ruth Berrow who still reside in the town of Crickhowell. Admiral John Gell died here in 1806 after serving over 30 years in the Royal Navy. The Glanusk Park estate was the childhood home of the former royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who still lives near the town as proprietor of T≈∑'r Chanter bed and breakfast lodgings.

Historically in the traditional county of Denbighshire, it is now administered as part of the wider Wrexham County Borough. In the 2011 census, it had a population of 4,468. It is located 10 miles south of Wrexham. It is situated between Wrexham and Oswestry and has been part of the County Borough since local government reorganisation in 1996. The border with the English county of Shropshire is immediately south of the town, on the other side of the River Ceiriog. The town is served by Chirk railway station and the A5/A483 roads. History and heritage Llwyn-y-cil Lodge, just inside the gates of Chirk Castle and a grade II listed building Chirk Castle, a National Trust property, is a medieval castle. Two families are associated with the town and its castle, the Trevor family of Brynkinallt and the Myddelton families. The Hughes of Gwerclas, a family descended from the ancient kings of Powys, also dwelt in the area for many years. Attractions in the town apart from Chirk Castle include a section of Offa's Dyke and the Chirk Aqueduct, part of a larger World Heritage Site including Pontcysyllte aqueduct, on the Llangollen Canal, built in 1801 by Thomas Telford. The Glyn Valley Tramway operated from here. The Parish Church of St Mary's is a Grade I listed building. The current church building was begun during the 11th Century by the Normans, although it is believed that an older llan, dedicated to St Tysilio, had existed on the site. Indeed, the current church was known by the dedication of St Tysilio until the late 15th or early 16th century, after which it was re-dedicated to St Mary. Today, the church is a member of the Open Church Network and participates in the Sacred Space Project. Chirk was formerly a coal mining community with coal being worked since the 17th century. The largest of these collieries were Black Park (one of the oldest in the north of Wales) and Brynkinallt (). These coal mines have now closed. Chirk was a coaching stop on the old Mail coach route along the A5 from London to Holyhead. The Chester to Ruabon railway had been extended south to Shrewsbury by 1848 with stations at Llangollen Road (at Whitehurst) and Chirk. South of the town a railway viaduct was constructed by Henry Robertson to take the line over the Ceiriog Valley. The Llangollen branch of the Shropshire Union Canal runs through Chirk. The canal crosses the Ceiriog Valley (from England into Wales) along Thomas Telford's aqueduct. Telford's aqueduct runs alongside the Robertson' viaduct before the canal enters the Chirk Tunnel. Modern day Looking towards Chirk over the Aqueduct and Viaduct St Mary's Parish Church Agriculture continues to be of some importance, as does tourism. The tourism industry flourishes thanks to Chirk's enviable location in the Northern Marches. The National Trust's Chirk Castle is an attraction, as is the World Heritage Site of the Llangollen Canal, whilst the stunning local scenery of the Ceiriog Valley and Berwyn Mountains provides some of the most beautiful landscapes in the UK. Manufacturing now plays a prominent position within the local industries, with major international firms such as Kronospan and Mondelez UK maintaining sites in the town. There are small business which support the local communities and its visitors, as well as service industries such as hotels, leisure facilities and restaurants. Despite the presence of these industries, the inhabitants of Chirk enjoy a wide range of employment opportunities and professions. Religion and worship no longer have the once prominent position that they held previously. However, there are four churches within the community:- St Mary's (Church in Wales), Chirk Methodist Church, Sacred Heart (Roman Catholic) and the Community Church. Together, these four churches have a thriving ecumenical community. Chirk is served by two local primary schools: Ysgol Y Waun and Pentre Church in Wales Controlled School. Ysgol Y Waun is the main primary school for children in Chirk. It was formed in 2012, following the merger of Chirk Infants School and Ceiriog Junior School. Ysgol Y Waun is a nursery, infant and junior school of mixed gender and lessons are taught through the medium of English. This large primary school has approximately 335 pupils on roll with an increasing number of pupils on free school meals ‚Äì 19.7% in 2014, which is above the Local Authority average but below the Wales average. Pentre School is a nursery, infant and junior school of mixed gender. There are approximately 86 pupils on roll who are all taught through the medium of English. Welsh is taught as a compulsory part of the school curriculum as a second language. The school is in a relatively affluent area, with only 15.9% of the school population eligible for free school meals which is substantially below the Local Authority and Wales averages. Most pupils in the community attend Ysgol Dinas Br√¢n, Llangollen, for their secondary education. Ysgol Dinas Br√¢n is a relatively large, bilingual secondary school catering for pupils from ages 11 ‚Äì 19 (including Sixth Form). Other secondary schools in the area include Ysgol Rhiwabon, St Martin‚Äôs School (Shropshire) and St Joseph‚Äôs in Wrexham. The area is served by independent schools, such as Moreton Hall and Ellesmere College. Although Chirk is a predominantly English-speaking area, some parents choose to educate their children through the medium of Welsh. Where this is the case, the nearest Welsh-medium primary schools are in Glyn Ceiriog and Cefn Mawr. Pupils can then transfer to either Ysgol Dinas Br√¢n, Llangollen or Ysgol Morgan Llwyd, Wrexham for Welsh-medium secondary education. The Ceiriog Memorial Institute, in the Ceiriog valley, just west of Chirk, is home to a collection of Welsh cultural memorabilia and was founded in the early 1900s to support the Welsh language, culture and heritage for future generations. In the 2011 census, a total of 3,652 residents (81.7%) have no skills in the Welsh language. Sport Chirk is home to Chirk AAA F.C., a football team founded in 1876. Chirk Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1991. The club closed in September 2012.‚ÄúChirk Golf Club‚Äù, ‚ÄúGolf‚Äôs Missing Links‚Äù.

Notable buildings in the town include the 14th-century parish church and a defensive tower house. According to traditional accounts Talgarth was the capital of the early medieval Welsh Kingdom of Brycheiniog. It is in the historic county of Brecknockshire. In 2011 it had a population of 1,724.Office for National Statistics Name The meaning of the town's name is in the Welsh words t√¢l (forehead or brow of a hill) and garth (mountain ridge or promontory), thus \\"end of the ridge\\". It appears as Talgart in 1121, as Talgard after 1130, and in its present form in the years between 1203 and 1208.http://www.cpat.org.uk/ycom/bbnp/talgarth.pdf Clwyd Powys Archaeological Trust: Historic Settlement Survey The church of Talgarth is recorded in 1488 as dedicated to Sce Wenne Virginis, explained as Gwen (granddaughter of Brychan), said to have been murdered by the Saxons. Culture and community In August, the Talgarth Festival of the Black Mountains is held, a popular countryside event which takes place each year. Talgarth Walking Festivalhttps://www.talgarthwalkingfestival.org/ takes place every May, making use of the town's position at the foot of the Black Mountains. The town also has a dazzling annual Christmas lights display, organised by Talgarth Town Council and a team of volunteers. Talgarth War Memorial Talgarth held important links with healthcare for many years as the home of the large psychiatric hospital, the Mid Wales Hospital and the Mid and West Wales College of Nursing and Midwifery. Changes in health legislation in the 1980s saw the need for such hospitals to be closed. The Mid Wales Hospital closed for good in the 1990s. Since the early 2000s, regeneration efforts have been in place to support Talgarth's futurehttps://www.visittalgarth.co.uk/Talgarth-Information/tourist- information-and-resource-centre. It has since benefited from a new relief roadhttps://www.transportxtra.com/publications/local-transport- today/news/5348/a479-talgarth-relief-road-and-a438-bronllys-bypass-powys/, to remove trunk road traffic from its centre, allowing new businesses to open and buildings to be renovated and restoredhttp://www.ghostsigns.co.uk/2018/06/evans-jones-ricketts-restoration- in-talgarth-mid-wales/. Its historic mill in the centre of town featured on the BBC's Village SOShttps://talgarthmill.com/watermill.html series and now attracts a new type of visitor to the area. History=Roman period= The Romans were in this area and there was a Roman camp at \\"Y Gaer\\" near Brecon ( Aberyscir). Indeed, the Romans were in this area and another Roman fort or station as sometimes these places were referred to has in recent years been found down river of Brecon and not so very far from Llangorse lake. Aerial reconnaissance discovered the outline of a yet un-excavated fort. A Roman fort near Cwmdu (Pen-y-Gaer) is also of significance to Talgarth as there was a Roman route from Abergavenny via Pen-y-Gaer up the Rhiangoll valley to Talgarth, some experts say to Castell Collen near Llandrindod. Much evidence has been lost in the intervening 2000 years, but there is growing circumstantial evidence to suggest there is a missing Roman fort in the Talgarth area, at the crossroads of two or possibly three Roman routes, the Roman road from Pen-y-gaer, from Clyro to Y Gaer near Brecon and even the river Llynfi itself, although the latter may not be acceptable to some archaeologists. Nevertheless, water routes, even small ones are not unknown to have been used for man-hauling equipment in small, narrow flat bottom boats.Raymond Selkirk, On the Trail of the Legions =The Dark Ages= Talgarth was the royal residence of Brychan King of Brycheiniog in the 5th century AD. With three wives, 24 daughters and 22 sons the family was an important force in Wales at that time. Responsible for the spread of Christianity throughout Brecknock, the daughters of Brychan and their descendants account for almost all of the saints of South Wales and include the grandmother of Saint David. =The Normans= The town (and Brycheiniog in general) was seized by the Norman Bernard of Neufmarch√©, who issued an undated charter concerning the district. The town became part of Bernard's Lordship of Brecknock (a Marcher Lordship - an almost sovereign state). Castell Dinas was the initial site where a Norman castle was established by the Normans to control the passes on both sides. However, in the reign of King John, the then Lord fell out with the king, and the east of the Lordship was detached in punishment, forming a new Marcher Lordship of Blaenllynfi, ruled by someone else. Although the caput of the latter Lordship was officially Blaenllynfi Castle, Talgarth was its principal town, and the Lordship was often called The Lordship of Talgarth as a result. The town was in the manor of English Talgarth, there being also a manor of Welsh Talgarth, in which Welsh laws prevailed. The Lordship of Blaenllynfi eventually found its way back to the descendants of the last Welsh princes of Brycheiniog (in the person of Rhys ap Hywel,Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem: Volume 7, Edward III, File 14, entry 177Brecknock in S.Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of Wales, London, 1849, online versionJohn Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, 1833-37, Volume 3, entry for Price, of Castle Madog great-great-great grandfather of Sir Dafydd Gam). Rhys played a significant part in the implementation (though not the planning) of the final coup against Edward II, and consequently Edward's son, Edward III, was not naturally well disposed towards him; the latter dispossessed Rhys' heir, and merged the Lordship of Blaenllynfi back into the Lordship of Brecknock (which, with the Lordship of Buellt, eventually became Brecknockshire, centuries later). The lands of the former lordship became a mere barony (of Talgarth). =The Welsh Jacobites= During the Jacobite revival support in Talgarth was strong. The town was a Jacobite hotspot, backing Bonnie Prince Charlie in his attempt to retake the Crown for the line of Stuart. In 1727 a meeting of local Jacobite sympathisers in Talgarth ended with members having to appear before a local magistrate to explain their actions. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 Bonnie Prince Charlie had expected the Welsh Jacobites to offer support, but after Jacobite David Morgan from Penygraig, Quakers Yard was hung, drawn and quartered for treason, the Welsh feared persecution. The failure of the Welsh Jacobites to join the House of Stuart Prince in Derby was one of the main failures of the Jacobite uprising. =The Methodist revival= In 1735 Talgarth saw the birth of the Welsh Methodist revival when Howel Harris, probably the most influential person to come from Talgarth, was converted in Talgarth church while listening to a sermon by the Rev. Pryce Davies. The revival would sweep across Wales leading to the development of one of the most influential Welsh denominations, that of the Calvinistic Methodists. It was at Talgarth that William Williams Pantycelyn converted, leading him to become one of Wales' most important hymn writers. Nearby is Trevecca, the location of the famous college that Harris established. Hywel Harris is buried in Talgarth at St Gwendoline's Church and his tombstone is still visible today. Talgrath is also thought to be the birthplace of the religious poet Jane Cave.Isobel Grundy, ‚ÄòCave , Jane (b. 1754/5, d. in or before 1813)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 December 2015 Buildings and other sites of note *Talgarth Mill, a water mill used for grinding grain *Town Hall (1877) with a memorial clock tower, overlooking the Square. *Tower House, also overlooking the Square, now the location of the Tourist Information Centre.

She founded the church of St Wenn and chapels at St Kew and Cheristowe (in Stoke-by-Hartland, Devon). She died on 18 October, year unknown. Saint Gwendoline is a saint from the 8th century.) *Nearby Bronllys Castle =Railway station= Former railway station at Talgarth, now a private residence and the trackbed in use as a main road. Talgarth had a railway station on the Mid-Wales Railway which closed in 1962. The station was opened in 1864 concurrent with the opening of the Mid-Wales company line between and ; regular services started in September 1864 but special trains had run at the end of August. It closed on 31 December 1962 when all lines to Brecon including the Mid-Wales line were closed. The station buildings remain as private residence near the Rugby Ground and the old track bed is now incorporated into the A479 road. =Chambered tomb ‚Äì Penyrwrlodd= A Neolithic long cairn and chambered tomb at Penyrwrlodd, south of Talgarth was discovered in June 1972 by a farmer when clearing a stone mound from a field for use as hard-standing in the farmyard. The cairn measures 5m by 22.5m and a maximum 3m high, and has been carbon dated to 3,900 BC, making it an early example of its type. The discovery led to archaeological excavation of the site by Dr Savory of the National Museum of Wales. During the excavation a number of human remains were found along with a bone flute, a human rib and some worked flints and stone. The flute was made from a sheep metapodial bone, has three holes and may either have been a simple flute or whistle. The larger hole may have been the blow-hole. This is the oldest dated musical instrument found from Wales. Outdoor activities=Gliding= The Black Mountains Gliding Club is based on the hillside to the southeast of the town. It attracts many visitors from all of the UK, due to the year-round ability to remain airborne by means of mountain lift, both ridge lift and wave lift.Black Mountains Gliding ClubTalgarth gliding club:: OS grid SO1732 ‚Äì Geograph British Isles ‚Äì photograph every grid square! =Pony trekking= There are a number of riding operators in the area who hire out horses for both experienced and novice riders. =Walking= The Black Mountains above the town are used for upland hiking and hill-walking. The mountain ridges are around 2000 feet high with the highest point called Waun Fach at 811 metres (2,660 feet). A walking festival based on the town and its hinterland was established in 2013. The event attracts visitors at the start of May each year.http://www.talgarthwalkingfestival.org/ Landscape and natural history Pwll-y-Wrach waterfall, near Talgarth There is an ancient woodland along the banks of the River Ennig just 1 km from the town centre. There are a series of waterfalls within the wood. The largest is called Pwll-y-wrach, which means* 'Witch's Pool'. Local legend suggests that witches may have been ducked in this pool in medieval times. There is a geology trail, explaining the environment of 400 million years ago. A large part of Pwllwrach wood is a nature reserve, owned and managed by the Brecknock Wildlife Trust. =Site of Special Scientific Interest= Pwll-y-wrach wood is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSI) because of its special habitat values and the existence of some quite rare plants, including the small-leaved lime tree and the lesser butterfly-orchid. These are regarded as indicator plants of Ancient Woodland. That is an area that has retained a continuous cover of trees for thousands of years. =Geology= The fossil remains of ancient armoured fishes have been found in rocks within the late Silurian/early Devonian-age Lower Old Red Sandstone rocks exposed in local streamsides. Microscopic analysis has found fish scales and fin spines of these ancient fish some 410 million years old. The research carried out by a local man, Roderick Williams. The remains were then sent to Australia to a fossil fish expert Dr Sue Turner for photographing and finally a scientific paper was published on these findings. Within the area of Talgarth the geology requires more long term research as a rare spider-like fossil was found at Tredomen quarry and remains of very ancient plants from the same age rocks. There is evidence of volcanic activity in the formation of air fall tuffs in the layers of rocks, blown out from a distant volcano. The nature of these tuffs infer an explosive type of eruption from volcanoes sited on the edge of a continental subduction zone. The whole area was probably tectonically unstable at the time. There is some barytes present in rocks at Pwll-y-Wrach. There is a small source of lead ore at the Gospel Pass in the uppermost reaches of the River Honddu where strings of galena were found circa 1800. There was also an unsuccessful trial mine for copper at Felin Fach nearer Brecon in the 17th century. Some rather interesting ore mixture was found. There was further exploration in the 19th century when speculation was running high; a fallen-in shaft and tunnel still exists. Copper in the form of small green patches of malachite has been found in rocks at the base of a large mountain gully above Velindre. It is not known if this was exploited but the area has been referred to as the 'copper works' in a manuscript on beating the boundary of Llanigon parish. Limestone in the form of 'calcrete' within the local sandstone rocks has been burnt for lime in many places across the Black Mountains for both lime mortar and agricultural uses. Some years ago a local man interested in geology (R. B. Williams) found a thick tuff bed (20 cm or so thick) in the banks of the River Ennig not far above Penbont Bridge in the vicinity of Talgarth. It was instantly recognised as probably being part of the so-called Townsend Tuff Bed which has three distinct beds or layers in close proximity, known as layers A, B and C. A is the lowest bed and is recognised by coprolites on its upper surface; these may be the droppings of some unidentified crustacean. The finder had seen these beds at Cusop and Merbach Hill (Herefordshire) and they are widely known throughout the Old Red Sandstone of the Anglo-Welsh area by geologists. Recently concern was shown that this middle bed was at risk from the building of Talgarth's flood defences in the upper River Ennig. The British Geological Survey team was contacted by the finder of tuff bed B, and they were very interested in its location because recently the BGS (2011) had been working on the same rocks on the Epynt hills (artillery range). On visiting they decided that this thick tuff bed at Penbont was probably Bed B. Williams then showed them another known tuff bed which had been found by another local geologist Mr Hawley, placed at 'The Rocks' Talgarth just upstream of the mill. This was instantly recognised as Bed A. Bed C has yet to be found but the two geologists from the BGS are now considering resurveying the geology of Talgarth. =Flora and fauna= In spring the wood is carpeted with a succession of wildflowers leading to a mass display of bluebells in mid-spring followed by ramsons in late spring. The wood is home to the most important colony of dormouse in the region and some uncommon bats, including the lesser horseshoe bat. Other mammals found in the wood include badgers, foxes and otters along with birds such as tawny owls, dippers and pied flycatchers. Governance Talgarth ward (and community) location Talgarth has a Town Council representing the views of the community and has twelve community councillors. The Talgarth ward elects a county councillor to Powys County Council. Since May 2004 it had been represented by Liberal Democrat councillor, William Powell (who also sits on the Town Council). He was re-elected unopposed in 2008 and 2012 Powell was also elected as an Assembly Member of the National Assembly for Wales in May 2011. In media=Filming= A number of films and dramas have been filmed in and around Talgarth, notably On the Black Hill. Others include Morgan's Boy (BBC) a rare drama, now unavailable, Nuts and Bolts (ITV), where scenes were shot at the old hospital, and Hearts of Gold (ITV), where the town was assumed to be Pontypridd. Rhod Gilbert's 2009 DVD Rhod Gilbert and the Award-Winning Mince Pie was partly shot in Talgarth. =Books= Talgarth features as a location in Alfred Walter Stewart's 1931 novel The Boathouse Riddle, written under the pen name J. J. Connington. The boathouse which inspired Stewart was at nearby Llangorse Lake.

Used as permanent homes, or for holiday or temporary accommodation, they are left often permanently or semi-permanently in one place, but can be moved, and may be required to move from time to time for legal reasons. Mobile homes share the same historic origins as travel trailers, but today the two are very different in size and furnishings, with travel trailers being used primarily as temporary or vacation homes. Behind the cosmetic work fitted at installation to hide the base, there are strong trailer frames, axles, wheels, and tow-hitches.  History  In the United States, this form of housing goes back to the early years of cars and motorized highway travel. It was derived from the travel trailer (often referred to during the early years as \\"house trailers\\" or \\"trailer coaches\\"), a small unit with wheels attached permanently, often used for camping or extended travel. The original rationale for this type of housing was its mobility. Units were initially marketed primarily to people whose lifestyle required mobility. However, in the 1950s, the homes began to be marketed primarily as an inexpensive form of housing designed to be set up and left in a location for long periods of time or even permanently installed with a masonry foundation. Previously, units had been eight feet or less in width, but in 1956, the 10-foot (3 m) wide home (\\"ten-wide\\") was introduced, along with the new term \\"mobile home.\\" The homes were given a rectangular shape, made from pre-painted aluminum panels, rather than the streamlined shape of travel trailers, which were usually painted after assembly. All of this helped increase the difference between these homes and home/travel trailers. The smaller, \\"eight-wide\\" units could be moved simply with a car, but the larger, wider units (\\"ten-wide\\", and, later, \\"twelve-wide\\") usually required the services of a professional trucking company, and, often, a special moving permit from a state highway department. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the homes were made even longer and wider, making the mobility of the units more difficult. Nowadays, when a factory-built home is moved to a location, it is usually kept there permanently and the mobility of the units has considerably decreased. In some states, mobile homes have been taxed as personal property if the wheels remain attached, but as real estate, if the wheels are removed. Removal of the tongue and axles may also be a requirement for real estate classification. =Manufactured home= Example of a modern manufactured home in New Alexandria, Pennsylvania. 28 feet √ó 60 feet (8.5 √ó 18.3 m) Mobile homes built in the United States since June 1976, legally referred to as manufactured homes, are required to meet FHA certification requirements and come with attached metal certification tags. Mobile homes permanently installed on owned land are rarely mortgageable, whereas FHA code manufactured homes are mortgageable through VA, FHA, and Fannie Mae. Many people who could not afford a traditional site-built home, or did not desire to commit to spending a large sum of money on housing, began to see factory- built homes as a viable alternative for long-term housing needs. The units were often marketed as an alternative to apartment rental. However, the tendency of the units of this era to depreciate rapidly in resale value made using them as collateral for loans much riskier than traditional home loans. Terms were usually limited to less than the thirty-year term typical of the general home-loan market, and interest rates were considerably higher. In that way, mobile home loans resembled motor vehicle loans more than traditional home mortgage loans.  Construction and sizes  Exterior wall assemblies being set in place during manufacture Mobile homes come in two major sizes, single-wides and double-wides. Single-wides are or less in width and or less in length and can be towed to their site as a single unit. Double-wides are or more wide and are in length or less and are towed to their site in two separate units, which are then joined together. Triple-wides and even homes with four, five, or more units are also built but less frequently. While site- built homes are rarely moved, single-wide owners often \\"trade\\" or sell their home to a dealer in the form of the reduction of the purchase of a new home. These \\"used\\" homes are either re-sold to new owners or to park owners who use them as inexpensive rental units. Single-wides are more likely to be traded than double-wides because removing them from the site is easier. In fact, only about 5% of all double-wides will ever be moved. While an EF1 tornado might cause minor damage to a site-built home, it could do significant damage to a factory-built home, especially an older model or one that is not properly secured. Also, structural components (such as windows) are typically weaker than those in site-built homes. 70 miles per hour (113 kilometers per hour) winds can destroy a mobile home in a matter of minutes. Many brands offer optional hurricane straps, which can be used to tie the home to anchors embedded in the ground.  Regulations =United States= F2 tornado In the United States, mobile homes are regulated by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), via the Federal National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. This national regulation has allowed many manufacturers to distribute nationwide because they are immune to the jurisdiction of local building authorities. By contrast, producers of modular homes must abide by state and local building codes. There are, however, wind zones adopted by HUD that home builders must follow. For example, statewide, Florida is at least windzone 2. South Florida is windzone 3, the strongest wind zone. After Hurricane Andrew in 1992, new standards were adopted for home construction. The codes for building within these wind zones were significantly amended, which has greatly increased their durability. During the 2004 hurricanes in Florida, these standards were put to the test, with great success. Yet, older models continue to face the exposed risk to high winds because of the attachments applied such as carports, porch and screen room additions. Such areas are exposed to \\"wind capture\\" which apply extreme force to the underside of the integrated roof panel systems, ripping the fasteners through the roof pan causing a series of events which destroys the main roof system and the home. The popularity of the factory-built homes caused complications the legal system was not prepared to handle. Originally, factory-built homes tended to be taxed as vehicles rather than real estate, which resulted in very low property tax rates for their inhabitants. That caused local governments to reclassify them for taxation purposes. However, even with that change, rapid depreciation often resulted in the home occupants paying far less in property taxes than had been anticipated and budgeted. The ability to move many factory-built homes rapidly into a relatively small area resulted in strains to the infrastructure and governmental services of the affected areas, such as inadequate water pressure and sewage disposal, and highway congestion. That led jurisdictions to begin placing limitations on the size and density of developments. Early homes, even those that were well- maintained, tended to depreciate in value over time, much like motor vehicles. That is in contrast to site-built homes which include the land they are built on and tend to appreciate in value. The arrival of mobile homes in an area tended to be regarded with alarm, in part because of the devaluation of the housing potentially spreading to preexisting structures. This combination of factors has caused most jurisdictions to place zoning regulations on the areas in which factory-built homes are placed, and limitations on the number and density of homes permitted on any given site. Other restrictions, such as minimum size requirements, limitations on exterior colors and finishes, and foundation mandates have also been enacted. There are many jurisdictions that will not allow the placement of any additional factory-built homes. Others have strongly limited or forbidden all single-wide models, which tend to depreciate in value more rapidly than modern double-wide models. Apart from all the practical issues described above, there is also the constant discussion about legal fixture and chattels and so the legal status of a trailer is or could be affected by its incorporation to the land or not. This sometimes involves such factors as whether or not the wheels have been removed. Cleveland, Mississippi The city of Cleveland, Mississippi, has made efforts to eliminate its \\"run-down mobile homes,\\" which the city describes as \\"unsightly.\\" North Carolina The North Carolina Board of Transportation allowed 14-foot-wide homes on the state's roads, but until January 1997, 16-foot-wide homes were not allowed. 41 states allowed 16-foot- side homes, but they were not sold in North Carolina. Under a trial program approved January 10, 1997, the wider homes could be delivered on specific roads at certain times of day and travel 10 mph below the speed limit, with escort vehicles in front and behind. Eventually, all homes had to leave the state on interstate highways. In December 1997, a study showed that the wider homes could be delivered safely, but some opponents still wanted the program to end. On December 2, 1999, the NC Manufactured Housing Institute asked the state Board of Transportation to expand the program to allow deliveries of 16-foot-wide homes within North Carolina. A month later, the board extended the pilot program by three months but did not vote to allow shipments within the state. In June 2000, the board voted to allow 16-foot-side homes to be shipped to other states on more two-lane roads, and to allow shipments in the state east of US 220. A third escort was required, including a law enforcement officer on two-lane roads.  Mobile home parks  Ames, Iowa, August 2010, during a flood Mobile homes are often sited in land lease communities known as trailer parks (also 'trailer courts', 'mobile home parks', 'mobile home communities', 'manufactured home communities', 'factory-built home communities' etc.); these communities allow homeowners to rent space on which to place a home. In addition to providing space, the site often provides basic utilities such as water, sewer, electricity, or natural gas and other amenities such as mowing, garbage removal, community rooms, pools, and playgrounds. There are over 38,000 trailer parks in the United States ranging in size from 5 to over 1,000 home sites. Although most parks appeal to meeting basic housing needs, some communities specialize towards certain segments of the market. One subset of mobile home parks, retirement communities, restrict residents to those age 55 and older. Another subset of mobile home parks, seasonal communities, are located in popular vacation destinations or are used as a location for summer homes. Newer homes, particularly double-wides, tend to be built to much higher standards than their predecessors and meet the building codes applicable to most areas. That has led to a reduction in the rate of value depreciation of most used units. Additionally, modern homes tend to be built from materials similar to those used in site-built homes rather than inferior, lighter-weight materials. They are also more likely to physically resemble site-built homes. Often, the primary differentiation in appearance is that factory-built homes tend to have less of a roof slope so that they can be readily transported underneath bridges and overpasses. The number of double-wide units sold exceeds the number of single-wides, which is due in part to the aforementioned zoning restrictions. Another reason for higher sales is the spaciousness of double-wide units, which are now comparable to site-built homes. Single-wide units are still popular primarily in rural areas, where there are fewer restrictions. They are frequently used as temporary housing in areas affected by natural disasters when restrictions are temporarily waived. Another recent trend has been parks in which the owner of the mobile home owns the lot on which their unit is parked. Some of these communities simply provide land in a homogeneous neighborhood, but others are operated more like condominiums with club homes complete with swimming pools and meeting rooms which are shared by all of the residents, who are required to pay membership fees and dues.  By country  Mobile home (or mobile- homes) are used in many European campgrounds to refer to fixed caravans, purpose-built cabins, and even large tents, which are rented by the week or even year-round as cheap accommodation, similar to the US concept of a trailer park. Like many other US loanwords, the term is not used widely in Britain. = United Kingdom = The Lookout Lodge, a mobile home by Prestige Homeseeker, marketed as a holiday home Mobile Homes or Static Caravans are popular across the United Kingdom. They are more commonly referred to as Park Homes or Leisure Lodges, depending on if they are marketed as a residential dwelling or as a second holiday home residence. Mobile homes are built to the BS3632 standard, which classifies the homes as being built to a residential standard. The majority of residential parks in the UK have a minimum age limit for their residents, and are marketed as retirement only parks due to this, but it is unlikely for a leisure lodge or static caravan holiday park to have such age restrictions. Beer, Devon, England. In addition to mobile homes, static caravans are popular across the UK. Static caravans have wheels and a rudimentary chassis with no suspension or brakes and are therefore transported on the back of large flatbed lorries, the axle and wheels being used for movement to the final location when the static caravan is moved by tractor or 4x4. A static caravan normally stays on a single plot for many years and has many of the modern conveniences one would normally find in a home. Mobile homes are designed and constructed to be transportable by road in one or two sections. Mobile homes are no larger than with an internal maximum height of . Legally, mobile homes can still be defined as \\"caravans\\". Static holiday caravans generally have sleeping accommodation for 6 to 10 people in 2, 3 or 4 bedrooms and on convertible seating in the lounge referred to as a 'pull out bed'. They tend towards a fairly \\"open-plan\\" layout, and while some units are double glazed and centrally heated for year-round use, cheaper models without double glazing or central heating are available for mainly summer use. Static caravan holiday homes are intended for leisure use and are available in and widths, a small number in and widths, and a few wide, consisting of two wide units joined together. Generally, holiday homes are clad in painted steel panels, but can be clad in PVC, timber or composite materials. Static caravans are sited on caravan parks where the park operator of the site leases a plot to the caravan owner. There are many holiday parks in the UK in which one's own static caravan can be owned. There are a few of these parks in areas that are prone to flooding and anyone considering buying a sited static caravan needs to take particular care in checking that their site is not liable to flooding. Some park owners used to have unfair conditions in their lease contracts but the Office of Fair Trading has produced a guidance document available for download called Unfair Terms in Holiday Caravan Agreements which aims to stop unfair practices. = Israel = Posting of caravan in Mitzpe Hila, Israel, 1982 Many Israeli settlements and outposts are originally composed of caravans ( caravan; pl. ◊ß◊®◊ê◊ï◊ï◊ê◊†◊ô◊ù, caravanim). They are constructed of light metal, are not insulated but can be outfitted with heating and air-conditioning units, water lines, recessed lighting, and floor tiling to function in a full-service capacity. Starting in 2005, prefabricated homes, named caravillas (), a portmanteau of the words caravan, and villa, begin to replace mobile homes in many Israeli settlements.  Difference from modular homes  Because of similarities in the manufacturing process, some companies build both types in their factories. Modular homes are transported on flatbed trucks rather than being towed, and lack axles and an automotive- type frame. However, some modular homes are towed behind a semi-truck or toter on a frame similar to that of a trailer. The home is usually in two pieces and is hauled by two separate trucks. Each frame has five or more axles, depending on the size of the home. Once the home has reached its location, the axles and the tongue of the frame are then removed, and the home is set on a concrete foundation by a large crane. Both styles are commonly referred to as factory- built housing, but that term's technical use is restricted to a class of homes regulated by the Federal National Mfd. Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Most zoning restrictions on the homes have been found to be inapplicable or only applicable to modular homes. That occurs often after considerable litigation on the topic by affected jurisdictions and by plaintiffs failing to ascertain the difference. Most modern modulars, once fully assembled, are indistinguishable from site-built homes. Their roofs are usually transported as separate units. Newer modulars also come with roofs that can be raised during the setting process with cranes. There are also modulars with 2 to 4 storeys.

The oldest clear evidence of use comes from pipes made of puma bone (Felis concolor) found with Anadenanthera beans at Inca Cueva, a site in the northwest of Humahuaca in the Puna border of Jujuy Province, Argentina. The pipes were found to contain the hallucinogen DMT, one of the compounds found in Anadenanthera beans. Radiocarbon testing of the material gave a date of 2130 BC, suggesting that Anadenanthera use as a hallucinogen is over 4,000 years old. Snuff trays and tubes similar to those commonly used for yopo were found in the central Peruvian coast dating back to 1200 BC, suggesting that insufflation of Anadenanthera beans is a more recent method of use.Cortella, M. Ruiz. 1995 Archaeological evidence of insufflation use within the period 500-1000 AD, in northern Chile, has been reported. Some indigenous peoples of the Orinoco basin in Colombia, Venezuela and possibly in the southern part of the Brazilian Amazon make use of yopo snuff for spiritual healing. Yopo snuff was also widely used in ceremonial contexts in the Caribbean area, including Puerto Rico and La Espa√±ola, up to the Spanish Conquest. Yopo snuff is usually blown into the user's nostrils by another person through bamboo tubes or sometimes snuffed by the user using bird bone tubes. Blowing is more effective as this method allows more powder to enter the nose and is said to be less irritating. In some areas the unprocessed ground beans are snuffed or smoked producing a much weaker effect with stronger physical symptoms. Some tribes use yopo along with Banisteriopsis caapi to increase and prolong the visionary effects, creating an experience similar to that of ayahuasca. = Effects = The first report of the effects of hallucinogenic snuff prepared from the beans of Anadenanthera peregrina dates back to 1496 when it was observed by Friar Ramon Pane, who was commissioned by Christopher Columbus, among the Taino Indians of Hispaniola. Pane's report was first published in 1511 in Martyr's descriptions of the New World. The description of its effects reads in part: \\"This kohobba powder,\\" described as \\"an intoxicating herb, is so strong that those who take it lose consciousness; when the stupefying action begins to wane, the arms and legs become loose and the head droops.\\" It is administered with a cane about one foot long of which they introduce one end \\"in the nose and the other in the powder and ...draw it into themselves through the nose\\". It worked quickly: \\"almost immediately they believe they see the room turn upside-down and men walking with their heads downwards\\". The administering witch-doctor took the drug along with his patients, intoxicating \\"them so that they do not know what they do and ... speak of many things incoherently\\", believing that they are in communication with spirits. =Active constituents=Bufotenin The beans have been found to contain up to 7.4% bufotenin.Pharmanopo- Psychonautics: Human Intranasal, Sublingual, Intrarectal, Pulmonary and Oral Pharmacology of Bufotenine by Jonathan Ott, The Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, September 2001 At up to 7.4% (74 mg per gram) bufotenin, an effective 40 mg dose of insufflated bufotenin requires little more than 0.5 grams of beans. The intraperitoneal of bufotenin is between 200‚Äì300 mg/kg (in rodents) with death occurring by respiratory arrest. The LD50 in rodents scales to between 10,000 mg and 15,000 mg for a small 50 kg (110 lb) adult. Based on the intraperitoneal LD50 for rodents, at 74 mg per gram, it would require approximately 135 grams of beans to reach the estimated LD50of bufotenin for a 50 kg (110 lb) adult. Human intravenous tests using bufotenin suggest the LD50 may be much lower in humans with subjects showing signs of peripheral toxicity (purple face, tachycardia, difficulty breathing, etc.) at doses as little as 8 mg in some subjects.TiKHAL, Alexander Shulgin, 1997 Free base bufotenin when insufflated, taken sublingually, orally, or intrarectally, elicits strong hallucinogenic effects with far less side effects. Dimethyltryptamine and 5-MeO-DMT The beans have been found to contain up to only 0.04% 5-MeO-DMT and 0.16% DMT. The leaves and bark also contain small amounts of DMT, 5-MeO- DMT and related compounds.Schultes 1976 Schultes 1977 Pachter et al. 1959 At up to 0.04% (0.4 mg per gram) 5-MeO-DMT, an effective light 5 mg dose of insufflated 5-MeO-DMT would require over 12 grams of beans. It would be extremely difficult to insufflate such a quantity, as tolerance would likely develop before the 12-gram nasal intake could be completed. Individual sensitivity to 5-MeO-DMT varies. It has been documented that the threshold dose in some individuals is as much as 10 mg insufflatedShamanic Snuffs or Entheogenic Errhines by Jonathan Ott, Page 102, 2001, requiring over 24 grams of beans for an effective dose of 5-MeO-DMT. At up to 0.16% (1.6 mg per gram) DMT, an effective 40 mg dose of insufflated DMT would require 25 grams or more. Because of its volume, it‚Äôs likely to be impossible to insufflate the 25 grams of beans required to reach the active dose of DMT present in the beans. An extract of 25 grams of beans could contain up to 1,850 mg of bufotenin, a potentially dangerous dose. With insufflated freebase bufotenin, the maximum published safe dose used has been 100 mg. Unlike bufotenin, both DMT and 5-MeO-DMT are relatively unstable and begin to degrade rather quickly. Schultes and colleges (1977) examined a 120-year-old bean collection and found 0.6% bufotenin with no DMT or 5-MeO-DMT present at all. They also examined a batch of beans that contained all three compounds when fresh, but found only bufotenin in the beans after only two years of storage. =Oral usage= When taken orally by some tribes in South America, small amounts are often combined with alcoholic chichas (maize beer). Moderate doses are unpleasant, producing nausea and vomiting. The beans were a main ingredient in bilca tauri, an oral purge medicine used to induce ritual vomiting once a month. Large amounts are not usually consumed orally; as many tribes believe oral use is dangerous. =Use with MAOIs= Some South American tribes have been documented to use various bean preparations along with Banisteriopsis caapi, an herb containing monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Typically Banisteriopsis caapi is chewed in the mouth while the Anadenanthera beans are snuffed or smoked. Occasionally Banisteriopsis caapi is found mixed in with the snuff.

Possible medicinal uses include: * fibromyalgia * hypertension * ulcerative colitis The pyrenoidosa species have been used in traditional Chinese medicine. Boraas (1983) reported a mutation in a population of Chlorella pyrenoidosa kept in his lab as a food stock for a population of flagellates. Due to a malfunction of his equipment some of the flagellates got in the Chlorella's tank. This caused a mutation from unicellular to multicellular. For early work in this area, a science project by David and John Watkins at Fairborn High School tested use of chlorella pyrenoidosa to support generation of oxygen for use in space missions. This was reported in the January 31, 1959 edition of the Fairborn Daily Herald and the project went on to win a top ranking at the Ohio State science fair in Columbus Ohio that year. The brothers were 14 and 13 years old at the time and based part of their work on information from the Kettering Foundation.

The battle was decided in 20 minutes by the devastating charge of Polish‚ÄìLithuanian cavalry, the Winged Hussars. The battle ended in the decisive victory of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces, and is remembered as one of the greatest triumphs of Commonwealth cavalry.  Background  On 27 September 1605, the Commonwealth and Swedish forces met near the small town of Kircholm (now Salaspils in Latvia, some 18 km south east of Riga). The forces of Charles IX of Sweden were numerically superior and were composed of 10,868 menFrost, R.I., 2000, The Northern Wars, 1558‚Äì1721, Harlow: Pearson Education Limited, and 11 cannons. The Swedish army included two western commanders, Frederick of L√ºneburg and Count Joachim Frederick of Mansfeld, with a few thousand German and Dutch mercenaries and even a few hundred Scots. The Polish Crown declined to raise funds for defence, although Great Hetman of Lithuania Jan Karol Chodkiewicz promised to pay out army wages from his own fortune, thereby gathering at least some army from Lithuania. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth army under Chodkiewicz was composed of roughly 1,000 infantry and 2,600 cavalry and only five cannons. However, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces were well-rested and their cavalry consisted mostly of superbly trained Winged Hussars or heavy cavalry armed with lances, while the Swedish cavalry were less-well trained, armed with pistols and carbines, on poorer horses, and tired after a long night's march over 10 km in torrential rain. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces had a small number of Polish cossack light cavalry and Lithuanian tatars light cavalry (cossack and tatar cavalry is a class of light cavalry in Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth at this date not to be confused with the Ukrainian/Russian Cossacks or Tatars), used mostly for reconnaissance.  Deployment  Position of both armies prior to Polish‚ÄìLithuanian attack The Swedish forces seem to have been deployed in a checkerboard formation, made up of the infantry regiments formed into seven or eight well-spaced independent blocks, with intersecting fields of fire. The flanks were to be covered by the Swedish and German cavalry and the cannons were placed in front of the cavalry. Charles' force was formed into four lines on the crest of a ride, with the first line consisting of four infantry battalions, cavalry in the second line, six infantry battalions in the third line and cavalry in the fourth line. The infantry battalions formed in squares of thirty by thirty, with pikemen in the center and shot on the edges, and gaps between the squares allowed passage of their cavalry. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz deployed his forces in the traditional deep Polish battle formation ‚Äì the so-called \\"Old Polish Order\\" ‚Äì with the left wing significantly stronger and commanded by Tomasz DƒÖbrowa, while the right wing was composed of a smaller number of hussars under Jan Piotr Sapieha and the centre, which included Hetman Chodkiewicz's own company of 300 hussars led by lieutenant Wincenty Woyna and a powerful formation of reiters sent by the Duke of Courland Friedrich Kettler. The Polish-Lithuanian infantry, mostly armed in Hungarian haiduk-style, drew up in the centre. Some 280 hussars were left as a general reserve under Teodor Lacki.  Battle  Chodkiewicz tried for four hours to lure the Swedes from their positions with his light cavalry sent out to skirmish between the two armies. Chodkiewicz, having smaller forces (approximately a 1:3 disadvantage), used a feint to lure the Swedes off their high position, pretending to withdraw. The Swedes under Charles thought that the Polish-Lithuanians troops were retreating and therefore advanced to the bottom of the slope, using his second line of cavalry to cover his flanks while the first line of infantry closed up. This is what Chodkiewicz was waiting for. The Commonwealth forces now gave fire with Kettlers' Courland harquebusiers while Wincenty Wojna's hussars charged at the Swedish lines, causing disorder in the infantry. The main battle started with the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian cavalry charge on the Swedish right flank, with about 1,000 hussars shattering Mansfield's reiters, and disordering the Swedish third line of infantry in their retreat. At the same time, on the Swedish left, 650 hussars under Jan Piotr Sapieha charged. After Charles sent in his reserve of 700 cavalry, Chodkiewicz sent in his reserves. The entire force of Swedish cavalry was finally put to rout, and in their flight disordered many of their own infantry, leaving them vulnerable to the hussars' charge. Polish‚ÄìLithuanian cavalry charge Within 30 minutes, the Swedish cavalry was in full retreat on both flanks exposing the infantry in the center to the hussars and the firepower of Chodkiewicz's infantry. The Swedish defeat was utter and complete. The army of Charles IX had lost at least half, perhaps as much as two-thirds, of its original strength. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian losses numbered only about 100 dead and 200 wounded, although the hussars, in particular, lost a large part of their trained battle horses. As in all crushing victories in this period, the larger part of the Swedish losses were suffered during the retreat, made more difficult by the dense forests and marshes on the route back to Riga, many drowning crossing the Dvina. The Lithuanians and Poles spared few. Polish‚ÄìLithuanian casualties were light, in large part due to the speed of the victory. During the hussar's charges it was the horses that took the greatest damage, the riders being largely protected by the body and heads of their horses.  Aftermath  After the defeat, the Swedish king was forced to abandon the siege of Riga and withdraw by ship back across the Baltic Sea to Sweden and to relinquish control of northern Latvia and Estonia. However, the Commonwealth proved unable to exploit the victory fully because there was no money for the troops, who had not been paid for months. Without pay they could not buy food or fodder for their horses or replenish their military supplies, and so the campaign faltered. An additional factor was the large number of trained horses lost during the battle, which proved difficult to replace. A truce was eventually signed in 1611, but by 1617 war broke out again, and finally in 1621 the new Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus, landed near Riga and took the city with a brief siege, wiping away ‚Äì in Swedish eyes ‚Äì much of the shame suffered at Kircholm. The Battle of Kircholm is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"KIRCHOLM 27 IX 1605\\".

Its population in reality could be as high as 160,000 because of the Sahrawi refugee camps. Despite the barren landscape, Tindouf is a resource-rich province, with important quantities of iron ore located in the Gara Djebilet area close to the border with Mauritania. Prior to Algerian independence, the area served as a strongpoint of several tribes of the nomadic Reguibat confederation. History Tindouf, 1880 Mus√©e RASD Polisario The town of Tindouf was rebuilt near an isolated Saharan oasis in 1852 by members of the Tajakant tribe, but sacked and destroyed by the Reguibat tribe in 1895. It remained deserted until French troops led by colonel Trinquet arrived in the area in 1934 and attached the region to the French Algeria territory. The province houses army and airforce bases for the Algerian military, and is strategically important due to its proximity to the Moroccan border, and its location at a four-country border crossing. From independence in 1956, the Kingdom of Morocco claimed the Tindouf area and western Algeria as part of Morocco. These claims are based on the allegations that until 1952, Tindouf was part of French Morocco and was administratively attached to Agadir, and promises made by parts of the Algerian underground during that country's war for independence. After Algeria's independence in 1962, Morocco's claim to Tindouf was not accepted by the new Algerian republic. This led to the 1963 Sand war, fought along the Moroccan-Algerian border in the Tindouf region, and also involving B√©char Province and Tlemcen Province, after Morocco claimed the area as its own following Algerian independence. In a process beginning in 1969 and finalized during the OAU summit in Rabat in 1972, Morocco recognized the border with Algeria, in exchange for joint exploitation of the iron ore in Tindouf. However, parts of Moroccan society and some nationalist political parties still refer to the Tindouf area as historically Moroccan territory, and the Moroccan parliament has still not ratified the border recognition. From 1974, refugees from the contested Spanish Sahara started arriving to the Tindouf area, following an earlier wave from the 1958 unrest. This turned into a major exodus from 1975 onwards, when Morocco and Mauritania seized control of what was then called Western Sahara, and Algeria retaliated by allowing the Polisario Front, a nationalist Sahrawi movement, to use the area as its main base. Sahrawi refugee camps were established in 1975-6 here. The Polisario remains in the province, running the large refugee camps located south of Tindouf city. The European Commission refers to the Sahrawi refugees as the \\"forgotten refugees\\".http://ec.europa.eu/echo/where/africa/algeria-western- sahara_en Administrative divisions The province contains one da√Øra (district), Tindouf, which is coextensive with the province. The province and da√Øra has a population of 58,193 inhabitants. The daira is further divided into two communes or municipalities: Tindouf and Oum El Assel. It is one of only 3 provinces in the country which has only one da√Øra and along with Bordj Baji Mokhtar Province, Djanet Province, In Guezzam Province also has the fewest communes with just 2.

The Lobo character was created by Roger Slifer and Keith Giffen, and first appeared in Omega Men #3 (June 1983). Lobo is an alien born on the utopian planet of Czarnia, and works as an interstellar mercenary and bounty hunter. Lobo was first introduced as a hardened villain in the 1980s, but soon fell out of use with writers. He remained in limbo until his revival as an anti-hero biker with his own comic in the early 1990s. Writers attempted to use Lobo as a parody of the 1990s trend towards \\"grim and gritty\\" superhero stories, epitomized by such Marvel Comics characters as Cable, Wolverine, and Punisher, but he was instead enthusiastically accepted by fans of the trend. This popularity led to the character having a much higher profile in DC Comics stories from then on, as well as starring roles in various series in the decades since. Lobo had his own webseries in 2000 with Greg Eagles and Kevin Michael Richardson voicing him, complete with graphic violence, strong profanity and sexual content. Lobo made his live-action debut in the 2019 premiere episode of the second season of the television series Krypton, portrayed by Emmett J. Scanlan.  Character development  The character enjoyed a short run as one of DC's most popular characters throughout the 1990s. This version of Lobo was intended to be a satire of the Marvel Comics superhero Wolverine. In issue #41 of Deadpool, a separate Marvel series, Lobo was parodied as \\"Dirty Wolff\\", a large blue- skinned man who drove a demonic motorcycle. He was also parodied in the Image Comics series Bloodwulf and as \\"Bolo\\" in the Topps Comics series Satan's Six. In a 2006 interview, Keith Giffen said, \\"I have no idea why Lobo took off... I came up with him as an indictment of the Punisher, Wolverine hero prototype, and somehow he caught on as the high violence poster boy. Go figure.\\"Comic Book Biography: Keith Giffen, Newsarama, March 10, 2006 (cached) He later stated that both Lobo and Ambush Bug were derived from Lunatik, a character he created in high school. Lobo was the favorite DC Comics character of Stan Lee.  Publication history  Lobo was introduced as a regular character in Keith Giffen and Roger Slifer‚Äôs Green Lantern and Teen Titans spin-off Omega Men. At that time, he was a Velorpian whose entire race had been exterminated by Psions and was partnered with Bedlam, whom he later killed; his origin was later retconned. After a well-received appearance in Justice League International, Lobo became a regular character in L.E.G.I.O.N. and its successor series R.E.B.E.L.S.. In 1990, he appeared in his own four-issue miniseries, Lobo: The Last Czarnian, plotted by Giffen, written by Alan Grant and with art by Simon Bisley, which changed his origin story: he became the last Czarnian after violently killing every other member of the species. That mini-series led to many subsequent miniseries and specials, including Lobocop, a RoboCop parody; Blazing Chain of Love, in which he is sent on a job to a harem; Paramilitary Christmas Special, in which he is contracted by the Easter Bunny to assassinate Santa Claus; Infanticide, where he kills his daughter and all of his other offspring that she has gathered to try to kill him; Convention Special, a send-up of comic book conventions; and Unamerican Gladiators, in which Lobo takes part in a deadly televised game show. Simon Bisley's dark humor fits well within the pages of his artwork by having countless mutilations of background characters occurring in each panel. Lobo also starred in his own DC title for 64 issues, from 1993 to 1999. Lobo has regularly made guest appearances in other series, even in cross-company interactions with such non-DC characters as The Mask, Judge Dredd, and the Authority. During the DC vs. Marvel crossover series, he fought Wolverine and lost due to popular vote by the fans. He also appeared very briefly in the JLA/Avengers inter-company crossover, and is shown fighting members of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard; although the outcome is not shown, it is mentioned that the Guard had trouble containing him. Lobo has made a few appearances in the animated series of the 1990s/2000s-era DC Animated Universe. At one point, an animated series and video game starring the character were to be released, but both were cancelled. However, a web-series was made in 2000 with 14 shorts.  Fictional character biography  Lobo is a Czarnian with exceptional strength and fortitude. He enjoys nothing better than mindless violence and intoxication, and killing is an end in itself; his name roughly translates as \\"he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it.\\" He is arrogant and self-centered, focusing almost solely on his own pleasures, although he proudly lives up to the letter of his promises ‚Äì but always no more or no less than what he promised. Lobo is the last of his kind, having committed complete genocide by killing all the other Czarnians for fun. As detailed in Lobo #0, Lobo unleashed a violent plague of flying scorpions upon his home world, killing most of its citizens. The first appearance of Lobo Physically, Lobo resembles a chalk-white human male with, generally, blood-red pupilless eyes with blackened eyelids. Like many comic book characters, Lobo's body is highly muscular, though his initial appearances were much leaner and less bulky compared to later iterations. Originally portrayed with neatly trimmed purple- grey hair, this was soon redesigned as a gray mane, later a long, straggly, gray-black rocker hair, dreadlocks, and more recently a pompadour. Similarly, the orange-and-purple leotard he wore in his first few appearances was replaced by black leather biker gear, and later replaced with both the robes of his office as a putative Archbishop and pirate-themed gear, then later a sleeveless flight suit/jumpsuit. His arsenal includes numerous guns and a titanium chain with a hook on his right arm. Extra weapons may include \\"frag grenades\\" and giant carving blades. Lobo has a strict personal code of honor in that he will never violate the letter of an agreement, saying in Superman: TAS that \\"The Main Man's word is his bond\\", although he may gleefully disregard its spirit. He is surprisingly protective of space dolphins, some of which he feeds from his home. A few have been killed in separate incidents, which he avenges with his usual violence. Lobo's friends include Dawg, a bulldog that he often claims is not his when it gets into trouble; Jonas Glim, a fellow bounty hunter; Ramona, a bail bondswoman/hairdresser; and Guy Gardner, whose friendship was cemented when Lobo came by Guy's bar Warriors where he gave Guy one of his Space Hogs and the skull of the Tormock leader Bronkk. Dawg is stomped to death by Lobo in Lobo #58 in which he again claims to Superman that the dog is not his; this is for the final time. Somehow, Dawg later appears alongside Lobo when Lobo goes to Earth to fight Green Lantern and Atrocitus.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #55 (August 2010) His enemies include the do-gooder superhero parody Goldstar, Loo, Vril Dox, Bludhound, Etrigan the Demon, and General Glory. Lobo generally tries to kill anyone he is hired to capture, including his fourth-grade teacher named Miss Tribb, his children, Santa Claus, and Dawg. Although his main targets are Superman and Deathstroke. Lobo frequents a restaurant, Al's Diner, where he often flirts with Al's only waitress, Darlene. Though Lobo protects these two from frequent danger, he does not seem to understand the distress caused by his tendency to destroy the diner. Al and Darlene later prosper due to Lobo's appetite for destruction; he destroys the city, except for the diner, leaving hordes of construction workers with only one place to eat lunch. He also ends up destroying a diner Al gives to him as part of a birthday celebration. The last revelation of Lobo and the diner appears to be in the pages of Lobo #1,000,000 (November 1998), where his last adventure is depicted. By the time of the action, he is already morbidly obese and working as a carnival attraction, scaring tourists into leaving their money behind. Then, a sexy client appears to offer him a last job: finding a legendary evildoer named Malo Perverso. At the prospect of a last well-paid job and a chance to score with the client, Lobo quickly agrees, and again invades the diner to use their Tesseract teleporter to reach his gear. It is revealed then the \\"client\\" is none other than Darlene, who wanted to see him back in his prime rather than see him sink even deeper into sloth. After reaching his gear, Lobo invades the HQ of the International Justice Legion Wanna-Bes and crushes all opposition in order to hack their files on Malo Perverso. There, he is attacked by Perverso himself, who then reveals himself to be Clayman, the team's shapeshifter, who admits he impersonated Perverso to get rid of Lobo. Clayman also squeals that the real Perverso went into a black hole. Lobo, still eager to find his bounty, goes into the black hole. Ironically, due to Lobo's interference in a planetary conflict in the same issue, Al later gets a package through the Tesseract for Lobo ‚Äì which promptly blows the diner up, yet again. At one point, Lobo has trouble with a clone of himself that had survived previous misadventures. A battle between the two makes it unclear which of them survived. Some fans conclude that the original Lobo was the victor, since later in the series, Lobo removes a miniature radio which he had surgically implanted in his head some time before the clone fight, and only organic matter can be cloned. The character has participated in several money-making schemes, such as being a priest and being a pop-rock idol. Most of these schemes tend to end with the violent deaths of nearly everyone involved. He has many friends among the bounty hunter world, though many tend to die when they are around Lobo, either by his hand or at the hands of the enemies he faces. = Crossovers = Lobo has both clashed and cooperated with Superman. He has also encountered Batman a couple of times, although one of these encounters was in the Elseworlds continuity. He has both fought and teamed up with Guy Gardner more than once, helping him to destroy various alien threats to Earth. Lobo often visits Warriors, Guy's bar, where he enjoys free drinks. He fights Aquaman when a traveling space dolphin visiting Earth is killed by Japanese fishermen. He ceases fighting when he learns Aquaman is not only a friend to dolphins but was raised by them. \\"Aw, frag,\\" mutters Lobo. \\"Now I gotta be civil.\\" Although Lobo feels he cannot hurt a fellow dolphin lover, he has no such mercy for the fishermen. Lobo also has appeared with the Authority. In one such appearance, Jenny Quantum finds a comic book detailing Lobo's murder of Santa Claus; she experiences a fit of rage and confusion. She breaks the barrier between her dimension and the dimension Lobo inhabits in the comic book, and Lobo finds himself in a fight with The Authority. Lobo has also had run-ins with Hitman, Valor, Starman, the Ray, Deadman, Green Lantern, the JLA, StormWatch, Mister Miracle, the Legion of Super-Heroes, Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman, Fate, Sovereign Seven, Supergirl, and Superboy, among others. = L.E.G.I.O.N./R.E.B.E.L.S. = Lobo acts as an independent bounty hunter until tricked by Vril Dox into nominally joining his interstellar police force, L.E.G.I.O.N. However, he continues solo activity, which seems to often bring him to Earth and in conflict with its heroes. Or, as in one case, base indifference.L.E.G.I.O.N. Annual #3 (1992, an Eclipso: The Darkness Within crossover tie-in) He remains loyal to Vril Dox after L.E.G.I.O.N. leadership is usurped by Dox's son, until an altercation between Lobo and Dox prompts Dox to release Lobo from his service. After this, Lobo becomes a full-time bounty hunter again. = Li'L Lobo = In the year 2000, a magical accident transforms Lobo into a teenager. In this condition, he joins Young Justice and eventually accompanies them to Apokolips, where he is killed in combat. However, the aforementioned magical accident has restored his ability to grow clones from a single drop of blood, and millions of Lobos rush into battle against Apokoliptian soldiers, whom the Lobos quickly defeat. The Lobos then turn on each other, until only one is left; in the process, the surviving Lobo regrows to adulthood. His time as a member of Young Justice becomes a distant memory. An additional weaker teenage Lobo with yellow eyes remained, however, having hidden from the fight; he rejoins Young Justice and chooses to rename himself Slobo (\\"[It]'s Lobo\\"). Eventually, this clone begins to degrade, becoming blind, and degenerating to the brink of death. Before he can die, however, Darkseid teleports him to the headquarters of Young Justice 1 Million in the 853rd Century, turning him into a statue, fully conscious and aware, in the process. When Lobo later encounters Robin and Wonder Girl again as members of the Teen Titans, he demonstrates no recollections of them or their history together, demonstrating that he has indeed forgotten his time as their teammate. = 52 = In the 2006‚Äì07 miniseries 52, Lobo reappears after an extended hiatus. He encounters a group of heroes (consisting of Adam Strange, Animal Man, and Starfire), who find themselves stranded in space after the events of the 2005‚Äì2006 \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline. To everyone's surprise, he does not kill them. Lobo professes to have found religion, becoming the spiritual leader of the whole of sector 3500, which was left in shambles by a still-unknown assailant. He is the current caretaker of the Emerald Eye of Ekron. After helping the lost heroes defeat Lady Styx, he brings the Emerald Eye to the triple-headed fish god, who agrees to release Lobo from his vow of non-violence in exchange. When told that the Emerald Eye is the only thing that can kill the fish god, Lobo blasts him with it. = One Year Later = Lobo appeared in \\"Deadly Serious\\", a two-part crossover miniseries with Batman in August 2007, written and drawn by Sam Kieth. In addition, Lobo has fought the Teen Titans and Blue Beetle in their respective titles in order to stop a rocket for the Reach, in which he failed. In the Reign in Hell miniseries, it is revealed that Lobo's soul was still in Hell following a deal he made with Neron during the 1995 Underworld Unleashed storyline. Lobo's suffering was enough to power Neron's whole castle. Lobo was freed from his prison in a battle between Etrigan and Blue Devil, and went on a rampage through Hell to seek revenge on Neron. In order to buy time to fully recover before battling Lobo, Etrigan stole Blue Devil's soul and informed him that he would have to fight Lobo to get it back. During Lobo's rampage he cut off Zatara's head, forcing his daughter, Zatanna, to send him to the Abyss, the soul death. Later, Lobo is shown aiding the JLA during their mission into Hell, where he helps Fire defeat the god Plutus.Justice League of America 80-Page Giant 2011.

After fighting Hal Jordan, Carol Ferris and Sinestro, he then flees. It is revealed that the fight was staged by Atrocitus himself. As a payment, Lobo is given a Red Lantern ring. = R.E.B.E.L.S. = Still wearing his red ring on a chain around his neck, Lobo is recruited from a bar by Vril Dox, who requires his help battling his \\"father\\" Brainiac and the Pulsar Stargrave, a captured weapon. Even losing his spacehog, Lobo saves the planet Colu, but with Brainac and Pulsar Stargrave escaping. Lobo became a senior member of Vril Dox's Legion based on the planet Rann. Lobo was the key to defeating Starro the Conqueror and his lieutenants, ensuring security for Rann, the Vega System and the galaxy. Unknown to Lobo, the Psions had created clones of Lobo attempting to bring back the Czarnian race, which could make them unstoppable, but the series ended before this was played out.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #9 (Late May 2010). DC Comics. = The New 52 = then established as an impostor Lobo. Art by Aaron Kuder.thumb In 2011, DC Comics rebooted the DC Universe continuity in an initiative called The New 52. A reimagined version of Lobo debuted in Deathstroke #9, written by Rob Liefeld. This Lobo is a Czarnian slaver who killed the rest of his race except for his beloved Princess Sheba.Deathstroke vol. 2 #9-12 (July‚ÄìOct. 2012). DC Comics. A second version, claiming to be the real Lobo and resembling more his original, Post-Crisis version, unlike the redesigned Lobo, was introduced in Justice League #23.2. Cultured and well- educated, although ruthless, this Lobo is an interstellar mercenary and bounty hunter, with a leaner physique akin to the character's earlier appearances. This new version sets course for Earth after discovering his counterpart, a Czarnian imposter, had been there. According to this version's backstory, Lobo was originally the bodyguard to the Czarnian royal family, who utilized a Eucharist-like ritual involving the planet's \\"life blood\\", pools similar to the Lazarus Pits. Drinking or bathing in these pools granted participants regenerative abilities, connecting them and the Emperor himself to the entire planet. However, an unknown party contaminated the \\"life blood\\", causing the Czarnian Emperor and any citizenry that had participated in the ritual to go insane, which in turn forced Lobo to commit planetary euthanasia. A new series featuring this version of Lobo debuted in October 2014 and was scheduled to be canceled with its December 2015 issue. = DC Rebirth = Lobo debuts in Justice League vs. Suicide Squad as one of the villains freed by Maxwell Lord, evidently restored to his Pre-New 52 persona. He is a member of Amanda Waller's first Suicide Squad. Batman eventually implants a bomb into Lobo's brain and detonates it, blowing up Lobo's head. After Lobo regenerates it, he discovers Batman did so to free him from Lord's control, and later accepts Batman's offer to join a new incarnation of the Justice League to repay the favour.Justice League vs. Suicide Squad #1-6 (Dec. 2016 ‚Äì Jan. 2017) In Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps, the New 52 incarnation of Lobo is shown to be held captive inside one of Brainiac 2.0's bottles. Guy Gardner almost frees him, before Hal Jordan grabs the bottle and tells him it is better to \\"leave him on the shelf\\".Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #12 (Jan. 2017)  Powers and abilities  In all comic books, Lobo is portrayed as a ruthless bounty hunter. He only has one rule: once he takes a contract, he finishes it no matter what, even if it means risking injury. If he has a counter-contract for even more money, then he will fulfill the new one. Lobo possesses extraordinary strength of undefined limits. His strength, much like his other powers, varies greatly depending upon different artistic interpretations by various comic book writers. In some instances, he is depicted as being barely stronger than a human while, in others, he demonstrates physical strength on a similar level to Superman. He has shown to be a match in strength for Etrigan the Demon each time that they have met. Lobo also possesses superhuman durability, which varies greatly too. Lobo is depicted, in some situations, as being injured by conventional bullets while, in other situations, he has the physical resiliency to stand toe to toe with Superman, survive unprotected in deep space, and withstand high level destructive weaponry and powerful explosive blasts without sustaining injury. He has displayed particular susceptibility to gaseous chemicals. In one instance, Lobo was declared immortal; after he died and went to Hell, he proved too much for the demons, and when he was then sent to Heaven, he wreaked so much havoc that he was permanently banished from the afterlife. If Lobo sustains injury, his accelerated healing factor enables him to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with superhuman speed and efficiency, and little apparent pain. Lobo also is functionally immortal. He is immune to the effects of aging and disease. As such, even though he can sustain sufficient injury to be out of commission for quite some time, he will apparently heal from any injury, given sufficient time. For instance, Lobo can regenerate out of a pool of his own blood, apparently recycling the cells.52 #20 (September 2006) At one time, Lobo could grow a copy of himself, possessing all of his skills and powers, out of every drop of his blood that was spilled. This power was removed by Vril Dox during Lobo's time with L.E.G.I.O.N., but Lobo regained it in the series Young Justice, in which he was de-aged by Klarion the Witch Boy and slaughtered while on a mission to Apokolips. His blood reformed into thousands of Lobo clones who waged war on the planet and then proceeded to murder each other until only one Lobo (the current one) was left. One of his other clones, Slobo, survived, but later began to fall apart until being dealt with by Darkseid. In 52, he again regenerated from a pool of blood, but no clones were created, so he no longer appears to retain this ability. Lobo possesses an amazingly developed sense of smell, which allows him to track objects between solar systems, as well as a separate tracking ability enabling him to track an individual across galactic distances. He is a formidable combatant with expertise in multiple forms of armed and unarmed combat. His favorite weapon is a large titanium alloy chain with a large gutting hook connected at the end, often referred to as \\"the garrote\\", that he keeps wrapped around his right wrist. At times, he also uses high-grade explosives and advanced firearms. Despite his violent and loutish nature, Lobo seems to have a genius- level intellect in matters of destruction and violence. He can create complex virulent agents and the corresponding antidotes; in one version of his backstory, he released such a plague on Czarnia as a science project, resulting in the deaths of the entire population in the span of one week. His vehicle, some sort of space-faring motorcycle (the \\"Space Hog\\"), often accompanies him. It is of his own design and, despite its size, it is capable of extended and speedy travel throughout space. Further, it protects those in its immediate vicinity from the hazards of space and somehow permits the ability to breathe and speak. He was also able to scavenge parts from a destroyed time hopper and attach them to his own bike, producing a working time machine. Lobo is fluent in many alien languages (according to Lobo, 17,897)52 #19 (September 2006) and extremely knowledgeable in the locations and cultures of worlds without external references. Lobo is known for his awkward behavior and love for cigars. He once was known to destroy an entire planet for not finding the cigar of his liking. It is not fully known the extent to which his powers are common for his race or unique to him. In the miniseries The Last Czarnian and elsewhere, it is stated that the cloning and healing abilities are traits possessed by all Czarnians, as is the apparent ability to survive in the vacuum of space. Before the reboot, Lobo was granted a Red Lantern Power Ring by Atrocitous during the \\"Brightest Day\\" storyline.  Czarnia  Czarnia () is a fictional planet, the homeworld of DC Comics character Lobo before he wiped out the entire planet's race. The last Czarnian can be seen in series Lobo The Last Czarnian by Simon Bisley and Keith Giffen. Czarnia no longer exists in the DC Universe. Contrary to the personality of their \\"last son\\", Czarnians were a peaceful race. Czarnia was in a golden age and had become a crime-free utopia that rivaled Krypton. They had many social institutions just like Earth, such as day care, music concerts and mental asylums. More focus on Czarnian civilization is shown in the novel DC Universe: Last Sons and Lobo Annual (vol. 2) #3 (1995). Czarnians, the former inhabitants of Czarnia, are described as a very peaceful society, unused to social unrest. They were wiped out after Lobo bio-engineers a small flying scorpion-like creature with a lethal sting and unleashes it on Czarnia. Death from the stings is very slow. Lobo believes he was the only remaining Czarnian, but in Simon Bisley and Keith Giffen's miniseries entitled Lobo: The Last Czarnian, he discovers that this was not quite the case. One Czarnian was off-world when he unleashed his plague, and by coincidence it happened to be his fourth grade teacher, Miss Tribb. Lobo happens to be under contract to deliver Miss Tribb to his employer Vril Dox, a very sensitive situation. Lobo takes his promises very seriously; he keeps his reputation by keeping his word. He keeps her alive, though at one point he removes her legs to keep her from wandering off. When he fulfills his contract by bringing her to Vril Dox, he then immediately kills her by snapping her neck. The story of Czarnia is very well known across the universe, due to the publication of a Lobo biography. This book is featured in Lobo #0 (October 1994), discussed by several crooks who are being pursued by Lobo himself. The planet later became the site of an assassination attempt on Lobo, which is detailed in the mini- series \\"Lobo Infanticide\\". Hundreds of his children, results of his womanizing, form a battalion to ambush him. Lobo, thinking he is taking parts in war games, patrols through various Czarnian canyons, even encountering his old house, which is still somewhat standing. Most of his children are slain in a battle with the 'Brutish' empire, a race of aliens who had decided to take the empty planet for their own. Lobo kills the invading force, then spends much time battling the last of his kids. These fights take place in a highly arid region, with little plant life. Eventually he is the sole survivor. The planet suffers much damage in the battles.  Other versions  * In the two- part Lobo vs. the Mask crossover, Lobo is hired for the sum of one billion credits by a council of survivors of several devastated planets to track down the individual responsible. His trail leads to Earth, where Lobo encounters the current wearer of an ancient mask. The resulting battle destroys Manhattan and leaves Lobo as nothing but a severed head, waiting for his body to re- grow. Big Head, convincing Lobo he wants the previous mask wearer, agrees to a team-up to hunt the \\"Ultimate Bastich\\" down. Big Head leads Lobo on a chase to nowhere, killing even more and blowing up a solar system in the process. Fed up with Big Head, Lobo uses a special \\"guilt grenade\\" to force the wearer to remove the mask so that he can use it himself. Lobo promptly kills an entire intergalactic bar full of aliens, and is sucked into a wormhole on his ride through space. Landing in parts unknown, Lobo/Mask heads to a single planet where, crashing the 400th annual Feel Good Games, he insults a king, and proceeds to kill numerous people. A crayon drawing left on his bike with the words \\"YOU SMELL\\" incurs his wrath, and he destroys numerous planets hunting down the one who drew the insulting picture. Waking up one day, Lobo finds himself back on Earth, and realizes the mask used him. Tossing it away, he leaves only to pass himself arriving on Earth. As it turns out, the wormhole sent him back in time roughly one month. He had been hired to hunt himself, and the alley where he dumped the mask was the same alley where the pickpocket would find it in Part 1. However, Lobo breaks the time loop, literally turning himself in as he shaves the other Lobo's head and paints him green for the reward money. Meanwhile, Big Head, realizing that Lobo has broken the loop, decides to have fun of its own on Earth. * In the Amalgam Comics universe, Lobo is fused with Howard the Duck to become Lobo the Duck. * \\"Coach Lobo\\" sends the Tiny Titans on a race around the world in issue #16 of that series. In a tirade about the laziness of his students, Lobo reveals that, \\"Back on my planet, when I was a kid, I had to run to school uphill both ways!... Uphill in the rain and snow together! Volcanoes were erupting all around us! Dolphins were everywhere! All we had for fun was exercise!\\" Coach Lobo also appeared in issues #18, #22, #32, #41, and #45.  In other media = Television = Animation  Lobo as he appears in Superman: The Animated Series. * Lobo first appeared on the small screen in the series Superman: The Animated Series, voiced by Brad Garrett. As in the comics, Lobo possesses exceptional strength and durability, as well as his usual over-the-top arsenal of weapons. The healing powers and advanced senses that he possesses in the comics are not shown, although he never sustains injuries as severe as he does in the comics. Lobo's gutting hook is used only twice in his appearances in Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"The Main Man\\", and it is not used for combative purposes, due to Broadcast Standards and Practices as well as difficulty animating the weapon. He mostly uses a crowbar, or simply his fists, for bludgeoning his opposition. In the episode \\"The Main Man\\", Lobo is hired by an alien named the \\"Preserver\\" to capture Superman and add him to the Preserver's collection of rare and endangered species. Preserver decides to add Lobo to his collection as well, since Lobo was also the last of his own race. Superman and Lobo join forces to escape. In return, Lobo promises to leave Earth alone. Lobo briefly appears in \\"Warrior Queen\\" in which Maxima falls in love with Superman. After Superman leaves, Lobo arrives in Maxima's throne room with a bounty on De'Cine and Maxima starts to get obsessed with Lobo. * An adult- oriented webseries titled Lobo, was released in 2000. The character was initially voiced by Greg Eagles and was later replaced by Kevin Michael Richardson. * Lobo eventually returns to Earth in the Justice League episode \\"Hereafter\\", with Brad Garrett reprising the role. Believing that Superman has died, Lobo wants to join the Justice League, insisting that only he could take Superman's place. The League reluctantly allowed Lobo to help them for a short time while they deal with a large number of supervillains running amok in Metropolis. Lobo manages to trap Kalibak under a pile of cars. In the end, Superman returns to the present where he prevents Deadshot from assassinating Batman. When Lobo states that the whole Justice League is together again, Superman tells him to count again, then fired him, stating that he is not Justice League material, and to clear out. Displeased with the thanks he got, Lobo gets on his hovercycle and tells the Justice League that the next time they need help, they shouldn't ask him. As Lobo takes off, Martian Manhunter shouts, \\"We didn't ask you this time!\\" * Lobo makes a cameo appearance in Legion of Super Heroes episode \\"Legacy\\". * Lobo appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Happy New Year!\\", voiced by David Sobolov. He first appears to attack the United Nations where he has a contract to target Secretary-General Tseng, only to be attacked by the Team's Beta Squad (which at that time consisted of Batgirl and Wonder Girl). During the fight, it is discovered that Tseng is secretly a Krolotean, after Lobo rips his disguise in half. Lobo then leaves with the Krolotean in order to give it to the people who hired him to capture it. Lobo returns in the Season 3 episode \\"Home Fires.\\" Hired to assassinate Forager, Lobo traveled to Earth where he attacked Nightwing's Team who were protecting Forager while losing a finger. Apparently succeeding in his contract, Lobo left Earth unaware that Forager had faked his death. It was revealed that the Light hired Lobo to target Forager. In the post-credits of \\"Nevermore,\\" Lobo kills a miniature clone of himself that morphed from the finger he lost. * Lobo appears in the animated series Justice League Action, voiced by John DiMaggio. He first appears in \\"Follow That Space Cab\\" where he is hired by Boss Kack to bring him Mr. Mind. This leads Lobo into a conflict with Superman who flees with Mr. Mind with the help of Space Cabbie. When Hawkman arrives, he helps Superman fight Lobo which ends with Lobo accidentally stepping on Mr. Mind. Upon presenting the squished remains to Boss Kack and demanding that he pay up, Boss Kack's robots point their lasers at him as Boss Kack asks Lobo if he is familiar with what happens if any part of a worm gets squished. In the episode \\"Rage of the Red Lanterns,\\" Lobo steals some Red Lantern rings which pits Atrocitus and the Red Lantern Corps against the Justice League. This is part of a diversion so that Lobo can unlock the power of the Spider Gauntlet. The Justice League and the Red Lantern Corps work together to defeat Lobo. In the episode \\"The Fatal Fare,\\" Lobo appears in Roxy Rocket's commercial as one of her clients.  Live- action  * Lobo is indirectly mentioned as a teaser in the Supergirl episode \\"Truth, Justice and the American Way\\" where Alex Danvers ask Martian Manhunter if he thinks a certain intergalactic bounty hunter is on Earth. Specifically, the exchange, taking place after their primary target was abducted by an enigmatic figure, had them speculating that the kidnapper was a bounty hunter who came to Earth, and Martian Manhunter ruled Lobo out since \\"if he were in town, [the Department of Extranormal Operations would] know.\\" * While not the actual character, the name 'Lobo' is referenced in the Legends of Tomorrow episode, Lucha de Apuestas where the magical fugitive, Kaupe, uses it as a wrestling name in 1961 Mexico. * Lobo appears in the second season of Krypton portrayed by Emmett J. Scanlan.  In June 2019, a spinoff titled Lobo was announced in development with Scanlan reprising his role. However following the cancellation of 'Krypton', this spinoff did not proceed. = Film = Live-action  In September 2009, Warner Bros. announced that Guy Ritchie would direct a live-action adaptation featuring the comic book character. Variety described the premise: \\"Lobo is a seven-foot tall, blue- skinned, indestructible and heavily muscled antihero who drives a pimped out motorcycle, and lands on Earth in search of four fugitives who are bent on wreaking havoc. Lobo teams with a small town teenage girl to stop the creatures.\\" Ritchie was scheduled to begin production of Lobo in early 2010 and bring an \\"irreverent, gruff tone\\" to the film as he did with previous films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, though the studio was reportedly aiming for a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. In early 2010, it was reported that Ritchie had left the project in order to pursue working on a sequel to his hit film Sherlock Holmes instead. The future of the movie was then put on hold. In 2012, Deadline reported that Brad Peyton would write and direct the film. July 2012, Dwayne Johnson announced via Twitter that he was in talks with Joel Silver and Brad Peyton to portray Lobo,Lee, Michael Jay. \\"Dwayne Johnson In Talks To Play DC Comic Anti- Hero Lobo,\\" Geeks of Doom (July 16, 2012). however on in February of the following year, Johnson left the project to play another villain from the DC Comics, Black Adam, in Shazam.Hickerson, Michael. \\"The Rock Leaves Lobo,\\" Slice of SciFi (Feb. 18, 2013).

In February 2018, DC Films is eyeing Michael Bay to direct the film inspired by the success of Tim Miller's Deadpool film, but only if Bay agrees to direct under the right budget that's below $200 Million. = Non-theatrical release = Andrew Bryniarski as \\"Lobo\\" in the AFI student film, The Lobo Paramilitary Christmas Special. In 2002, Scott Leberecht directed a film adaptation of The Lobo Paramilitary Christmas Special as part of the American Film Institute's director's studies program. Andrew Bryniarski stars as Lobo, with Tom Gibis as the Easter Bunny and Michael V. Allen as Santa Claus. The film was made with a budget of $2,400, although many professionals donated time and effort. It premiered at the AFI in May 2002.

Later he has a full cameo as Martian Manhunter and the Flash attack the Earth-Three versions of Green Arrow and Black Canary. He is seen being defeated by Martian Manhunter, and, along with Warwolf, is ultimately bested when the ship he is standing on is sunk and was not to be seen again for the duration of the film. * Lobo appears in Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Aquaman: Rage of Atlantis, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. He is first seen at Dread Lake which is a dry lake bed which Aquaman tries to fight him at until the Justice League arrives. Lobo managed to escape with a glowing blue orb. He did this on behalf of Ocean Master so that he would return Lobo's pet dolphin named Fishy who became a member of the Red Lantern Corps named Fishy. When the Justice League plans to destroy Atrocitus' S.L.U.R.P. (short for Submerged Limitless Underwater Rapid Pump), Lobo is reunited with Fishy and aids the Justice League. Once the S.L.U.R.P. is destroyed and Earth's oceans are restored, Lobo handcuffs Atrocitus and Dex-Starr as he and Fishy them to Oa to collect the bounty on them. * He appears in Lego DC: Shazam!: Magic and Monsters, voiced again by Fred Tatasciore.

Although he was seemingly killed, Lobo later meets with Superman and Martian Manhunter at the top of the Daily Planet where he reveals that there are more Martians and possibly more Kryptonians too before departing Earth. = Video games = * In 1995, Ocean Software was developing a Lobo game for the Atari Jaguar CD, Mega Drive/Genesis and Super NES. It was a fighting game, featuring many characters from Lobo's comic stories. A six-page preview of the game was featured in the video game magazine Nintendo Power, Volume 84 (May 1996). As previewed, the game still had some bugs and lacked sound. Reviews of the finished Genesis version appeared in GamePro and Electronic Gaming Monthly. The reviewers panned the game as having poorly drawn characters, jerky special moves, and a single-player mode in which only Lobo is playable. The game was canceled before its release. A prototype of the finished Genesis version has been found and a ROM image of it was released on September 15, 2009 by a Spanish Sega community, while a prototype of the Super Nintendo version was also found and a ROM image of it was released on February 10, 2016 at the AssemblerGames community. * Lobo appears in Injustice: Gods Among Us, with David Sobolov reprising his voicing role from Young Justice. * Lobo appears as a playable character in DC Unchained.

He wrote under several pen-names, including Francis Iles, Anthony Berkeley and A. Monmouth Platts.  Life  Anthony Berkeley Cox was born in 1893 in Watford, and educated at Sherborne School and University College, Oxford. After serving in the British Army in the First World War, he worked as a journalist for many years, contributing to such magazines as Punch and The Humorist. His first novel, The Layton Court Mystery, was published anonymously in 1925. It introduced Roger Sheringham, the amateur detective who features in many of the author's novels including the classic Poisoned Chocolates Case. In 1930, Berkeley founded the Detection Club in London along with Agatha Christie, Freeman Wills Crofts and other established mystery writers. His 1932 novel (as \\"Francis Iles\\"), Before the Fact was adapted into the 1941 classic film Suspicion, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. Trial and Error was turned into the unusual 1941 film Flight From Destiny starring Thomas Mitchell. In 1938, he took up book reviewing for John O'London's Weekly and the Daily Telegraph, writing under his pen name Francis Iles. He also wrote for the Sunday Times in the 1940s and for the Manchester Guardian, later The Guardian, from the mid-1950s until 1970.

A modular building is a prefabricated building that consists of repeated sections called modules. Modularity involves constructing sections away from the building site, then delivering them to the intended site. Installation of the prefabricated sections is completed on site. Prefabricated sections are sometimes placed using a crane. The modules can be placed side-by-side, end-to-end, or stacked, allowing for a variety of configurations and styles. After placement, the modules are joined together using inter-module connections, also known as inter-connections. The inter-connections tie the individual modules together to form the overall building structure.  Uses  Modular home in Sutton, Alaska Modular buildings may be used for long-term, temporary or permanent facilities, such as construction camps, schools and classrooms, civilian and military housing, and industrial facilities. Modular buildings are used in remote and rural areas where conventional construction may not be reasonable or possible, for example, the Halley VI accommodation pods used for a BAS Antarctic expedition. Other uses have included churches, health care facilities, sales and retail offices, fast food restaurants and cruise ship construction. They can also be used in areas that have weather concerns, such as hurricanes. Modular buildings are often used to provide temporary facilities, including toilets and ablutions at events. The portability of the buildings makes them popular with hire companies and clients alike. The use of modular buildings enables events to be held at locations where existing facilities are unavailable, or unable to support the number of event attendees. Construction process Construction is offsite, using lean manufacturing techniques to prefabricate single or multi-story buildings in deliverable module sections. Often, modules are based around standard 20 foot containers, using the same dimensions, structures, building and stacking/placing techniques, but with smooth (instead of corrugated) walls, glossy white paint, and provisions for windows, power, potable water, sewage lines, telecommunications and air conditioning. Permanent Modular Construction (PMC) buildings are manufactured in a controlled setting and can be constructed of wood, steel, or concrete. Modular components are typically constructed indoors on assembly lines. Modules' construction may take as little as ten days but more often one to three months. PMC modules can be integrated into site built projects or stand alone and can be delivered with MEP, fixtures and interior finishes. The buildings are 60% to 90% completed offsite in a factory-controlled environment, and transported and assembled at the final building site. This can comprise the entire building or be components or subassemblies of larger structures. In many cases, modular contractors work with traditional general contractors to exploit the resources and advantages of each type of construction. Completed modules are transported to the building site and assembled by a crane. Placement of the modules may take from several hours to several days. Permanent modular buildings are built to meet or exceed the same building codes and standards as site-built structures and the same architect-specified materials used in conventionally constructed buildings are used in modular construction projects. PMC can have as many stories as building codes allow. Unlike relocatable buildings, PMC structures are intended to remain in one location for the duration of their useful life. Manufacturing considerations The entire process of modular construction places significance on the design stage. This is where practices such as Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) are used to ensure that assembly tolerances are controlled throughout manufacture and assembly on site. It is vital that there is enough allowance in the design to allow the assembly to take up any \\"slack\\" or misalignment of components. The use of advanced CAD systems, 3D printing and manufacturing control systems are important for modular construction to be successful. This is quite unlike on-site construction where the tradesman can often make the part to suit any particular installation.

Tyler Texas File:Briar-ritz- exterior.jpgPratt Modular Homes \\"The Briar Ritz\\" Advantages Simultaneous site development and building construction at the plant reduces schedule by 30% to 50% Modular buildings are argued to have advantages over conventional buildings, for a variety of reasons. *Speed of construction/faster return on investment. Modular construction allows for the building and the site work to be completed simultaneously. According to some materials, this can reduce the overall completion schedule by as much as 50%. This also reduces labor, financing and supervision costs. To save even more time and money, nearly all design and engineering disciplines are part of the manufacturing process. Also unique to modular construction is the ability to simultaneously construct a building's floors, walls, ceilings, rafters, and roofs. During site-built construction, walls cannot be set until floors are in position, and ceilings and rafters cannot be added until walls are erected. On the other hand, with modular construction, walls, floors, ceilings, and rafters are all built at the same time, and then brought together in the same factory to form a building. This process can allow modular construction times of half that of conventional, stick-built construction. *Indoor construction. Assembly is independent of weather, which can increase work efficiency and avoids damaged building material. *Modular housing unit in storageAbility to service remote locations. Particularly in countries in which potential markets may be located far from industrial centers, such as Australia, there can be much higher costs to build a site-built house in a remote area or an area experiencing a construction boom such as mining towns. Modular buildings are also beneficial in providing medical and sanitary facilities where time, space, and money are an issue. *Low waste. With the same plans being constantly built, the manufacturer has records of exactly what quantity of materials are needed for a given job. With the consistency, builders can design systems that use common lengths of lumber, wallboard, etc., cut items with maximum efficiency, or be able to order special lengths in bulk. While waste from a site-built dwelling may typically fill several large dumpsters, construction of a modular dwelling generates much less waste. According to the UK group WRAP, up to a 90% reduction in materials can be achieved through the use of modular construction. Materials minimized include: wood pallets, shrink wrap, cardboard, plasterboard, timber, concrete, bricks, and cement. *Environmentally friendly construction process. Modular construction reduces waste and site disturbance compared to site-built structures. The controlled environment of the factory allows for more accurate construction while allowing the extra materials to be recycled in-house. *Flexibility. One can continually add to a modular building, including creating high rises. When the needs change, modular buildings can be disassembled and the modules relocated or refurbished for their next use reducing the demand for raw materials and minimizing the amount of energy expended to create a building to meet the new need. In essence, the entire building can be recycled in some cases. *Quality. Combining traditional building techniques, quality manufacturing and third- party agencies who offer random inspections, testing, and certification services for quality control, commercial modular buildings are built in strict accordance with appropriate local, state, and national regulations and codes. Due to the need to transport modules to the final site, each module must be built to independently withstand travel and installation requirements. Thus the final module-to-module assembly of independently durable components can yield a final product that is more durable than site-built structures. Modular buildings often use Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) in construction, which offer a range of advantages over traditional building materials. SIPs panels are a light yet durable combination of panel board and either closed-cell polyurethane (PU) or expanded polystyrene (EPS) insulating foam. They are air- tight, and as such provide excellent thermal performance. They also offer superior damp and cold resistance when compared to timber and other materials, and are immune to both compression shrinking and cold bridging. Modular units may also be designed to fit in with external aesthetics of any existing building and modular units once assembled can be virtually indistinguishable from a site-built structure. * Improved Air Quality ‚Äì Many of the indoor air quality issues identified in new construction result from high moisture levels in the framing materials. Because the modular structure is substantially completed in a factory-controlled setting using dry materials, the potential for high levels of moisture being trapped in the new construction is eliminated. Modular buildings can also contribute to LEED requirements in any category site-built construction can, and can even provide an advantage in the areas of Sustainable Sites, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, and Indoor Environmental Quality. Modular construction can also provide an advantage in similar categories in the International Green Construction Code. Disadvantages *Volumetric: Transporting the completed modular building sections take up a lot of space. * Flexibility: Due to transport and sometimes manufacturing restrictions, module size can be limited, affecting room sizes. * Some financial institutions may be hesitant to offer a loan for a modular home. =Market acceptance= Raines Court is a multi-story modular housing block in Stoke Newington, London, one of the first two residential buildings in Britain of this type. (December 2005) Some home buyers and some lending institutions resist consideration of modular homes as equivalent in value to site-built homes. While the homes themselves may be of equivalent quality, entrenched zoning regulations and psychological marketplace factors may create hurdles for buyers or builders of modular homes and should be considered as part of the decision-making process when exploring this type of home as a living and/or investment option. In the UK and Australia, modular homes have become accepted in some regional areas; however, they are not commonly built in major cities. Modular homes are becoming increasingly common in Japanese urban areas, due to improvements in design and quality, speed and compactness of onsite assembly, as well as due to lowering costs and ease of repair after earthquakes. Recent innovations allow modular buildings to be indistinguishable from site-built structures. Surveys have shown that individuals can rarely tell the difference between a modular home and a site- built home. =Modular homes vs. mobile homes= Differences include the building codes that govern the construction, types of material used and how they are appraised by banks for lending purposes. Modular homes are built to either local or state building codes as opposed to manufactured homes, which are also built in a factory but are governed by a federal building code. The codes that govern the construction of modular homes are exactly the same codes that govern the construction of site-constructed homes. In the United States, all modular homes are constructed according to the International Building Code (IBC), IRC, BOCA or the code that has been adopted by the local jurisdiction. In some states, such as California, mobile homes must still be registered yearly, like vehicles or standard trailers, with the Department of Motor Vehicles or other state agency. This is true even if the owners remove the axles and place it on a permanent foundation. =Recognizing a mobile or manufactured home= A mobile home should have a small metal tag on the outside of each section. If you cannot locate a tag, you should be able to find details about the home in the electrical panel box. This tag should also reveal a manufacturing date. Modular homes do not have metal tags on the outside but will have a dataplate installed inside the home, usually under the kitchen sink or in a closet. The dataplate will provide information such as the manufacturer, third party inspection agency, appliance information, and manufacture date. =Materials= The materials used in modular homes are typically the same as site constructed homes. Wood-frame floors, walls and roof are often utilized. Some modular homes include brick or stone exteriors, granite counters and steeply pitched roofs. Modulars can be designed to sit on a perimeter foundation or basement. In contrast, mobile homes are constructed with a steel chassis that is integral to the integrity of the floor system. Modular buildings can be custom built to a client's specifications. Current designs include multi-story units, multi-family units and entire apartment complexes. The negative stereotype commonly associated with mobile homes has prompted some manufacturers to start using the term \\"off-site construction.\\" New modular offerings include other construction methods such as cross- laminated timber frames. = Financing = Mobile homes often require special lenders. Modular homes on the other hand are financed as site built homes with a construction loan Standards and zoning considerations Typically, modular dwellings are built to local, state or council code, resulting in dwellings from a given manufacturing facility having differing construction standards depending on the final destination of the modules. The most important zones that manufacturers have to take into consideration are local wind, heat, and snow load zones. For example, homes built for final assembly in a hurricane- prone, earthquake or flooding area may include additional bracing to meet local building codes. Steel and/or wood framing are common options for building a modular home. Some US courts have ruled that zoning restrictions applicable to mobile homes do not apply to modular homes since modular homes are designed to have a permanent foundation. Additionally, in the US, valuation differences between modular homes and site-built homes are often negligible in real estate appraisal practice; modular homes can, in some market areas, (depending on local appraisal practices per Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice) be evaluated the same way as site-built dwellings of similar quality. In Australia, manufactured home parks are governed by additional legislation that does not apply to permanent modular homes. Possible developments in equivalence between modular and site-built housing types for the purposes of real estate appraisals, financing and zoning may increase the sales of modular homes over time. In Wales (UK), a businessman authorized the placement of 6 mini modular homes called ‚ÄúPods‚Äù for homeless persons on private property.https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/17645573.homeless-pods-in- newport-have-saved-six-people-form-a-life-on-the-streets/?ref=fbshr =Building strength= Modular homes are designed to be stronger than traditional homes by, for example, replacing nails with screws, adding glue to joints, and using 8‚Äì10% more lumber than conventional housing. This is to help the modules maintain their structural integrity as they are transported on trucks to the construction site. However, there are few studies on the response of modular buildings to transport and handling stresses. It is therefore presently difficult to predict transport induced damage. When FEMA studied the destruction wrought by Hurricane Andrew in Dade County Florida, they concluded that modular and masonry homes fared best compared to other construction. =CE marking= The CE mark is a construction norm that guarantees the user of mechanical resistance and strength of the structure. It is a label given by European community empowered authorities for end-to-end process mastering and traceability. All manufacturing operations are being monitored and recorded: * Suppliers have to be known and certified, * Raw materials and goods being sourced are to be recorded by batch used, * Elementary products are recorded and their quality is monitored, * Assembly quality is managed and assessed on a step by step basis, * When a modular unit is finished, a whole set of tests are performed and if quality standards are met, a unique number and EC stamp is attached to and on the unit. This ID and all the details are recorded in a database, At any time, the producer has to be able to answer and provide all the information from each step of the production of a single unit, The EC certification guaranties standards in terms of durability, resistance against wind and earthquakes. =Surfaces and finishes= Modular buildings can be assembled on top of multiple foundation surfaces, such as a crawl space, stilts (for areas that are prone to flooding), full basements or standard slab at grade. They can also be built to multi-story heights. Motels and other multi-family structures have been built using modular construction techniques. The height to which a modular structure can be built depends on jurisdiction, but a number of countries, especially in Asia, allow them to be built to 24 floors or more. Exterior wall surfaces can be finalized in the plant production process or in the case of brick/stone veneers, field applications may be the builders' choice. Roof systems also can be applied in the field after the basic installation is completed. =U.S. regional differences with modular construction= Weather, population density, geographical distances, and local housing architecture play a role in the use of modular construction for home building. Because modular construction is so adaptable, it has begun to permeate every region of the U.S. Northeast The northeast is populated with factories that can combine modular housing design with other construction methods such as panelization and SIPs. Modules are typically limited to 16' width and up to 70' lengths because of the narrow road structure and densely populated areas of the region. Other limitations are placed on transportation to locations such as Connecticut, Cape Cod, and Long Island. Mid-Atlantic The Mid-Atlantic region is similar to the northeast, in terms of building design and transport restriction to modules to a width of not more than 16'. Southeast Manufacturers in the Southeast often limit their ability to customize homes and focus on very traditional single story floor plans. Much of the south is in coastal and high wind areas; modular construction may prove appealing in this area as it is already inherently stronger as it must be built for transport and craned installation, therefore offering wind resistance as good or higher than site-built construction. Central Plains The central plains states typically are made up of farming and rural communities. Ranch homes are the mainstay of the region. Prone to strong storms and tornado conditions, modular construction offers the ability to better withstand these storm patterns than its site built counterpart. The inter-module attachments that must be made when assembling a modular home on a foundation offer an inherently stronger home than site built construction can offer. Interior finishes on both the walls and ceilings are typically textured. Corners on interior walls are typically rounded and finish trim around windows is optional. Because of the wider road and lower population density, modules can be as wide as 20' and as long as 90'. The ability to provide larger modules reduces the amount of modules needed to complete a home. Rockies Home design in this area ranges from Chalet style homes to log cabin style homes. Manufacturers in the region therefore provide a number of styles of homes. Capability varies from factory to factory as well as the ability to do complete customization of floor plans. Transportation is limited mostly to 16' wide modules to travel the roads of the area. West Coast The high cost of living in coastal areas, and especially California, may provide modular construction an edge due to its lower cost. Extreme building regulation and environmental requirements can delay the start of residential construction. Several factories specialize in environmentally responsible construction by following green construction standards and offering zero energy homes. Living in coastal areas also mean that the modular home structure should be strong enough to withstand winds with high velocity. Modular homes, built correctly, have such kind of resistance to stand high wind velocity without any damage issues.  Open modular building  The term Modularity can be perceived in different ways. It can even be extended to building P2P (peer-to-peer) applications; where a tailored use of the P2P technology is with the aid of a modular paradigm. Here well-understood components with clean interfaces can be combined to implement arbitrarily complex functions in the hopes of further proliferating self- organising P2P technology. Open modular buildings are an excellent example of this. Modular building can also be open source and green. Bauwens, Kostakis and PazaitisBouwens, M., Kostakis, V., & Pazaitis, A. 2019. The Commons Manifesto. University of Westminster Press, London, pg. 24 elaborate on this kind of modularity. They link modularity to the construction of houses. This commons-based activity is geared towards modularity. The construction of modular buildings enables a community to share designs and tools related to all the different parts of house construction. A socially-oriented endeavour that deals with the external architecture of buildings and the internal dynamics of open source commons. People are thus provided with the tools to reconfigure the public sphere in the area where they live, especially in urban environments. There is a robust socializing element that is reminiscent of pre-industrial vernacular architecture and community-based building.Bouwens, M., Kostakis, V., & Pazaitis, A. 2019. The Commons Manifesto. University of Westminster Press, London, pg. 25 Some organisations already provide modular housing. Such organisations are relevant as they allow for the online sharing of construction plans and tools. These plans can be then assembled, through either digital fabrication like 3D printing or even sourcing low-cost materials from local communities. It has been noticed that given how easy it is to use these low-cost materials are (for example: plywood), it can help increase the permeation of these open buildings to areas or communities that lack the know-how or abilities of conventional architectural or construction firms. Ergo, it allows for a fundamentally more standardised way of constructing houses and buildings. The overarching idea behind it remains key - to allow for easy access to user-friendly layouts which anyone can use to build in a more sustainable and affordable way. Modularity in this sense is building a house from different standardised parts, like solving a jigsaw puzzle. 3D printing can be used to build the house. The main standard is OpenStructures and its derivative Autarkytecture.  Key markets  Permanent modular buildings can be utilized in any application where stick-built construction is used. The primary markets served are K-12 education, higher education student housing, office and administrative space, retail and hospitality, healthcare, and publicly funded facilities.  Research and development  Modular construction is the subject of continued research and development worldwide as the technology is applied to taller and taller buildings. Research and development is carried out by modular building companies and also research institutes such as the Modular Building Institute and the Steel Construction Institute,.

Originally consisting of Giants Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack in 1976, Meadowlands Arena was added to the complex in 1981 and New Meadowlands Stadium (now MetLife Stadium) replaced Giants Stadium in 2010. Its first Chairman and CEO was David A. \\"Sonny\\" Werblin. Its present Chairman is Carl Goldberg and its CEO is Vincent Prieto. Over the years, the NJSEA's purview expanded to include Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport and the Wildwoods Convention Center in Wildwood. In Atlantic City, the Authority oversaw the construction and development of the Convention Center and the renovation of the historic Boardwalk Hall, the long-time home of the Miss America Pageant. In the 1990s the NJSEA built the New Jersey State Aquarium (now known as the Adventure Aquarium) in Camden. The NJSEA also contributed to the construction of the Meadowlands Environment Center in Lyndhurst, just across Berry's Creek from the Sports Complex. The 16-member Board of Commissioners is appointed by the Governor to four-year terms, subject to confirmation by the New Jersey Senate and it includes three ex officio members: The Authority President, the State Treasurer and a designated representative of the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission. The Authority holds regularly scheduled meeting which are open to the public. The minutes of all Authority meetings are subject to approval by the Governor. Joe Plumeri, owner of the Trenton Thunder and CEO of Willis Group Holdings, was Commissioner of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority from 1997 to 2004. The NJSEA facilities are home to the New York Giants and Jets, which also serves as major venues for concerts and family shows. Since 1976, NJSEA buildings have hosted many major events, including Super Bowl XLVIII, seven games of the 1994 World Cup, the 1996 Men's Final Four, NFL playoff games and Super Bowl championship celebrations, the 2002 and 2003 NBA Finals, the Stanley Cup Finals of 1995, 2000, 2001 and 2003, the 1999 Women‚Äôs World Cup, many other international soccer matches - including Pel√©'s farewell game, a 1995 Papal Mass by Pope John Paul II and countless major concerts. The Meadowlands Racetrack, a leading standardbred racing and simulcasting facility, is home to harness racing‚Äôs prestigious Hambletonian Stakes and hosts a fall thoroughbred meet. Historic Monmouth Park is the site of a summer thoroughbred meet highlighted by the Haskell Invitational won in dramatic fashion in 2009 by the filly, Rachel Alexandra. The NJSEA also operates the Off Track Wagering (OTW) facility, Favorites at Woodbridge, and has received approval to open a second OTW in Bayonne. The NJSEA also provides in-house security, emergency medical services, and fire protection staff to the entire Meadowlands Sports Complex, including MetLife Stadium, the replacement for Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex built privately by the Jets and Giants, as they have done in the past at Giants Stadium. The NJSEA owns the land beneath the American Dream Meadowlands shopping complex. It issued $1.15 billion in municipal bonds to support the project. In February 2018, it was announced that Vincent Prieto, former Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly would step down from his post and succeed Wayne Hasenbalg as President and Chief Executive Officer, a position that will pay him a $280,000 per year annual salary.Grant, Meghan. \\"Vincent Prieto stepping down, will lead New Jersey Sports & Exposition Authority\\", The Record (Bergen County), February 15, 2018.

The name Kryten is a reference to the head butler in the J.M. Barrie play The Admirable Crichton.Red Dwarf Series II DVD booklet, BBC Video, 2003 Originally referred to as a Series III mechanoid, he is later described as a 4000 Series, or Series 4000. In their original plan for the series, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor had specified that there would be no aliens and no robots. Following the success of the first appearance by the Kryten character, Naylor convinced Grant to bring him back. In the character's first appearance, originally only intended as a one-off, Kryten was played by actor David Ross but the popularity of the character meant that Kryten was introduced as a regular in Series III. The intention was to bring Ross back to play the role, but he was not available at the time and the position was filled by actor Robert Llewellyn. David Ross later returned to voice Talkie Toaster in the series IV episode \\"White Hole\\" and the series XII episode \\"Mechocracy\\".  Fictional history = Television = 1980s  Kryten was portrayed by David Ross in his debut appearance. Kryten (as portrayed by David Ross) first appeared in the Red Dwarf episode \\"Kryten\\" (1988), where he is characterised as a service mechanoid on board the Nova 5, a spacecraft originally from Earth. Kryten says that his entire purpose is \\"to serve and have no regard for himself\\". He sends a distress call which is picked up by the crew of the mining ship Red Dwarf, claiming that the male crew died when the Nova 5 crash landed on a planetoid, while the female crew are‚Äîaccording to Kryten himself‚Äî\\"stable, but injured\\". The female crew have actually been dead for \\"centuries\\"‚ÄîKryten apparently not realising this, and continuing to feed and serve them. Because there is no-one else on board the Nova 5, Kryten starts a new life on Red Dwarf with the hologram Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie) as his new master. Dave Lister (Craig Charles) persuades Kryten to rebel against Rimmer (which includes showing him the films Rebel Without a Cause and Easy Rider) and to become independent. Kryten changes the portrait of Rimmer he paints to make it appear as though he was sitting on the toilet, and then pours soup onto Rimmer's bed sheets. Kryten takes Lister's space-bike and goes out to find a planet with an atmosphere where he can grow a garden, which had always been a dream of his. This episode also marks a 'first' in science-fiction history in which an android deliberately gives a human being the 'finger'. Kryten (as portrayed by Robert Llewellyn) returns in \\"Backwards\\" (1989), where he permanently becomes part of the Red Dwarf crew. At the start of the episode, Kryten is described in some scrolling text as being found in pieces after his space-bike crashed on an asteroid. Lister rebuilds Kryten, although he is unable to recapture his former personality. In the episode proper, Kryten causes the Starbug 1 shuttle to fall into a time hole while taking a driving test facilitated by Rimmer. The ship crash lands on Earth in a reality where time runs backwards, leaving Kryten, Rimmer and Red Dwarfs computer Holly (Hattie Hayridge) stranded. Rimmer and Kryten spend three weeks working as the novelty act \\"the Sensational Reverse Brothers\\" and begin to enjoy life in this new reality, but are fired by a pub manager (Arthur Smith) for a fight that Rimmer and Kryten become involved in later that night. Lister and the Cat (Danny John-Jules) come to rescue Rimmer, Kryten and Holly in another Starbug to get back to Red Dwarf. In \\"Timeslides\\" (1989), Lister is seen travelling back in time by entering a photographic slide with mutated developing fluid to convince his younger self (played by Emile Charles) become wealthy and successful and not join the Space Corps. This consequently causes Kryten to never be rescued. Rimmer unwittingly reverses this new timeline by going back in time to his boyhood self (played by Simon Gaffney), causing Kryten to return to Red Dwarf. In \\"The Last Day\\" (1989), a replacement android for Kryten is shown travelling en route to Red Dwarf, and a countdown for Kryten's shut down disc activates, leaving Kryten with only twenty-four hours notice before all mental and physical action automatically stops, because of his service life expiring so the new model can be sold. Kryten reveals that he has a strong faith in Silicon Heaven, an afterlife for electrical equipment, which Lister tries and fails to convince to Kryten that it isn't real. After feeling enjoyment for the first time at a party, Kryten overrides his shut down programming and causes his replacement, Hudzen (Gordon Kennedy), to shut down (preventing him from deactivating Kryten by force) because Hudzen's android brain is unable to cope with the idea there is no Silicon Heaven; Kryten only surviving because he knew he was lying to Hudzen.  1990s  In \\"Camille\\" (1991), Lister is shown trying to teach Kryten how to lie, cheat and be offensive as part of a way to make Kryten break his programming and become independent. After Kryten dates and falls in love with a pleasure GELF called Camille (Judy Pascoe)‚Äîfirstly in the form of a 4000 Series GTI mechanoid, and later her original amorphous blob form‚ÄîCamille's estranged husband Hector (Rupert Bates), who like Camille is also a blob, lands in Red Dwarfs hangar to take her back and find an antidote for their condition. Kryten lies to Camille to protect her feelings and give her her best shot at happiness by convincing her to go with Hector. In the episode \\"DNA\\" (1991), Kryten is briefly transformed into a human being (played by Llewellyn, minus his usual make-up) when the DNA from his part organic brain is used to alter Kryten's entire molecular structure. He quickly decides to change himself back into mechanoid form, because he feels miserable about making fun of Kryten's spare heads (all played by Llewellyn), the ones Kryten describe as those closest to him, and because being a mechanoid is what he \\"always ha[s] been\\" and \\"always will be\\". In \\"The Inquisitor\\" (1992), Kryten is put on trial by the legendary android known as the Inquisitor (John Docherty) to determine whether or not his existence is justified or a waste. After Kryten is found unworthy of existence, the memory of Kryten is erased, and the Inquisitor replaces Kryten's life with that of an alternative, uncredited Kryten who never got a chance at life. This alternative Kryten is killed by the Inquisitor, while Lister subsequently tricks the Inquisitor into erasing himself from existence, causing the memory of Kryten to be restored. In \\"Demons and Angels\\" (1992), Red Dwarf is blown up when the beam of a device called the triplicator is put into reverse, putting the engine core into meltdown, while creating a \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" version of Red Dwarf, complete with their own versions of Kryten (both played by Llewellyn). Before the lifespans of both versions of Red Dwarf expire after an hour, the crew collect pieces of the triplicator from both Red Dwarfs, and restore the original Red Dwarf by amalgamating the two copies with a rebuilt triplicator. The \\"high\\" version of Kryten is blown up by a bomb the \\"lows\\" throw at him, while the \\"low\\" version disappears with his version of Red Dwarf. In \\"Back to Reality\\" (1992), ink from a \\"despair squid\\" causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination, with the hallucinations attacking things they each consider \\"quintessential to [their] self-esteem\\". In the hallucination, Kryten believes he is a half-human android traffic control officer called Jake Bullet, and while hallucinating, appears to kill a man (Lenny Von Dohlen), going against what Kryten believes is fundamental to him ‚Äî \\"never to take a life\\". The four nearly commit suicide together, but a mood stabiliser saves them at the last second. According to backstory in \\"Psirens\\" (1993), Kryten's creator is Professor Mamet. According to a \\"Psiren\\" duplicate of Mamet (portrayed by Jenny Agutter), Kryten is coded not to harm Mamet, and to obey her every command. In the episode, Kryten explains that Red Dwarf was \\"stolen\\", with the crew now based inside Starbug chasing after Red Dwarf to recover it. In \\"Out of Time\\" (1993), Rimmer mentions that all trace of Red Dwarf has been lost. In the episode, a Starbug from fifteen years hence arrives, with Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten's future selves intending to copy some components from the present Starbugs time drive so they can fix the fault in their own drive and continue their lives of opulence, socialising with notorious figures of history such as the Habsburgs, the Borgias, Louis XVI, Adolf Hitler and Hermann G√∂ring. Lister tells the future crew to leave, and the future Starbug fires upon the present day one, apparently killing the crew and blowing Starbug up. In the following episode, \\"Tikka to Ride\\" (1997), Lister mentions in a video log that the future Starbug destroying the Starbug of the present meant the time drive they had used ceased to exist in both the present and the future, or in other words, killing the present crew of Starbug in the present also killed the crew in the future, making it impossible for the future crew from ever going back in time to kill themselves in the present. The Cat later mentions in the episode that time returned to the point before the time drive was discovered. According to Lister in \\"Ouroboros\\" (1997), Kryten ended up alone aboard the Nova 5 because he killed the crew in an accident, and prior to that on the SS Augustus, that ship's crew had all died of old age. In the episode, a Kryten from a parallel dimension (played by Llewellyn) is briefly seen, when a \\"linkway\\" through \\"non-space\\" is opened when the membrane between the two realities temporarily collapses. In \\"Beyond a Joke\\" (1997), a rogue simulant (Don Henderson) gives Kryten access to a file in his CPU which Kryten had never been able to access before. According to this file, Professor Mamet was due to marry a fellow bio-engineer, John Warburton. When Warburton jilted Mamet the day before their wedding, as an act of revenge, Mamet created the 4000 Series of droids in his image. As part of the joke, all of Kryten's negative emotions are stored in a file: Kryten's \\"nega drive\\". When this file gets full, it blows, just like Warburton used to. In \\"Epideme\\" (1997), Kryten mentions completing his Bachelor of Sanitation course at \\"toilet university\\" many years prior, where he studied the \\"lavatorial sciences\\". Navigation Officer Kristine Kochanski (Chlo√´ Annett) retorts that \\"toilet university\\" is simply a piece of software installed in Kryten. Lister has his right arm amputated in an attempt to rid his body of the Epideme virus (voiced by Gary Martin). Kochanski ultimately gets rid of the virus by temporarily stopping Lister's heart and containing the virus in deceased Red Dwarf crewmember Caroline Carmen's (Nicky Leatherbarrow) arm, injected with blood and adrenaline, and tricking the virus into thinking the arm belongs to Kochanski. In the following episode, \\"Nanarchy\\" (1997), Kryten tries looking for his self-repairing nanobots to rebuild Lister's arm. Returning to the part of space where they were last seen, the crew discovers Red Dwarf has been converted by the nanobots into a planetoid made of sand and Holly restored to his old settings (played by Norman Lovett) and abandoned there, with the Red Dwarf Starbug spent years chasing after being a subatomic version shrunken down and eventually exploring Lister's laundry basket, and the remaining bits they didn't want being left on the planetoid. Kryten orders the nanobots to rebuild Lister's arm and turn the planetoid back into Red Dwarf. In Back in the Red (1999), Holly creates a new set of nanobots to bring the entire crew on board Red Dwarf back to life after Kryten's had gone missing again. Included among the resurrected crew is Rimmer, after the hologrammatic simulation of Rimmer left Starbug. Lister, Rimmer, Cat, Kryten and Kochanski are sentenced to two years in the ship's brig for misuse of confidential information. While on trial for unrelated crimes against the Space Corps, Kryten is also classified as a woman under Space Corps directives, because he doesn't have a penis. In \\"Cassandra\\" (1999), the five of them get signed up by Lister to the convict army the Canaries after Holly lies to Lister that they're a singing troupe. In \\"Krytie TV\\" (1999), the prisoner Kill Crazy (Jake Wood) reprograms Kryten. After his reprogramming, Kryten turns into a \\"ruthless entrepreneur\\" that runs a pay TV service in the prisoners' cinema called Krytie TV, making him rich, feared and respected from hidden camera programming. In Pete Part Two (1999), Kryten feels humiliated about being classified as a woman and being posted to the women's wing of the brig due to him being \\"genitally challenged\\". To rectify this, he creates a penis he calls \\"Archie\\" out of an old electron board, toilet roll, sticky-back plastic and an Action Man's polo neck. Archie, however, subsequently escapes Kryten and Kochanski's cell and runs amok in the prison. In \\"Only the Good...\\" (1999), a corrosive micro-organism is shown eating apart Red Dwarf. After Rimmer tries and fails to obtain the formula for an antidote from a \\"mirror universe\\" where everything is opposite, and not being able to find anyone on Red Dwarf upon returning, a vending machine (voiced by Tony Slattery) informs Rimmer that everyone crossed back into the mirror universe. The machine opening the way to the mirror universe is shown to have been destroyed by the micro-organism, leaving Rimmer stranded and the only crew member aboard Red Dwarf in his universe.  2000s  In Red Dwarf: Back to Earth (2009), set nine years later, Red Dwarf is intact; the human race is apparently \\"virtually extinct\\" in the universe apart from Lister again; Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten are the only people on board the ship; and Rimmer is shown to be a hard light hologram and the most senior officer on board again; how these have come about and what happened to the micro-organism is not explained. In this special, a female \\"despair squid\\", whose ink causes joy and elation instead of despair to defend herself, causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination where they believe they are fictional characters from a TV series called Red Dwarf, and their dimension is \\"invalid\\". This leads them to be shown being pulled into the nearest \\"valid\\" reality. They confront the \\"Creator\\" of Red Dwarf (Richard O'Callaghan) on a version of 21st century Earth who is ready to kill off the characters, and Lister accidentally kills him. The four subconsciously realise that they're hallucinating, and they wake up on board Red Dwarf. Kryten and Rimmer speculate that they were able to choose whether or not they wanted to wake up because of the strengthened antibodies of the four from the previous encounter with the despair squid. Lister initially believes that Kochanski is dead as well, but two children in the hallucination (played by Charlie Kenyon and Nina Southworth) inform that Kryten lied to him, and she actually left him after taking a Blue Midget shuttle. Kryten later confirms this.  2010s  In \\"Krysis\\" (2016), Kryten begins suffering from a mid-life crisis on the 2,976,000th anniversary of his creation. He loses interest in the things he normally enjoys and subsequently installs a bright red \\"pimptactular\\" carbon-fibre shell to his body in order to recapture his youth and gains a sudden attraction to bungie jumping. Butler (Dominic Coleman), an earlier model of mechanoid that achieved far more than Kryten, deliberately sabotages Starbug to allow Kryten to meet the Universe (voice of Daniel Barker) so Kryten can feel better about himself. The Universe also tells Kryten to remove his new suit because it \\"really sucks\\". In \\"Mechocracy\\" (2017), Kryten is elected president of the machines on Red Dwarf after running against Rimmer. = Novels = According to the novel Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers (1989), the Nova 5 crashed because Kryten washed the navigation computer with soapy water. Personality Having lost his obedience programmes, Kryten is able to better himself. While he continues to be a sanitation droid, and to enjoy cleaning and serving others, he has also become the science expert amongst the Dwarfers, often leading missions such as their search for Rimmer on the psi- moon in \\"Terrorform\\" (1992). The dichotomy between these two aspects of his personality leads to Rimmer naming him things such as \\"Captain Bog-bot\\" and \\"Commander U-Bend\\". Kryten also extends his emotional range, which leads to him deactivating his shutdown disk (DivaDroid, his creators, believes in planned obsolescence), although the crew are then forced into a showdown with his would-be replacement. His greatest ambition is to be human, and to this end he attempts to learn to lie and insult people (mostly Rimmer). Perhaps the most significant element of his personality is guilt. When his ability to feel guilty for his actions is compromised in some way, he can become careless, rude and even aggressive. This guilt is not necessarily balanced out by a sense of pride in the good work he does ‚Äî in the episode \\"The Inquisitor\\" (1992), he believes his selflessness was purely a matter of programming and therefore he has not led a worthwhile life. In the episode \\"Back to Reality\\" (1992), Kryten almost commits suicide when under the belief that he takes the life of a human (he later finds out it was just an illusion created by the despair squid). Kryten has at least three spare heads, one of which has droid- rot (a condition similar to computer senility) that gives it a Lancastrian accent. The spare heads can engage in conversation with Kryten. In \\"Stoke Me a Clipper\\" (1997), Kryten mentions that Spare Head 3 once told him that the other heads held a poll and voted Kryten as the ugly, big-eared one, upsetting Kryten. The others take turns being main head. All of these are destroyed in \\"Beyond a Joke\\" (1997) due to the final step of Mamet's joke; eventually a 2X4B mechanoid will \\"blow its top\\" (due to Lister wanting to put ketchup on a lobster). The \\"nega drive\\" which caused this has been removed, and, luckily, Kryten's personality chips survive and get placed in a new head. Kryten forms an irrational dislike of Kochanski when he first meets her, mostly out of a fear that she and Lister would fall in love and abandon him. However, he grows to respect her (although not necessarily like her) after she saves Lister's life from the Epideme virus. Playing Kryten Robert Llewellyn writes in his book The Man in the Rubber Mask that before settling on a Canadian accent, he, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor considered Swedish and American. Llewellyn discovered the Canadian accent while spending time in Vancouver, British Columbia; which he describes as being a cross between Scottish and American. The Kryten make-up was a constant source of discomfort for Llewellyn, as the prosthetic rubber mask required him to be in make-up for up to six hours. By Series VII, this had been reduced to two hours. Llewellyn was the only British cast member originally invited to participate in the American version of Red Dwarf, though Chris Barrie was, later, also approached to reprise his role of Rimmer as \\"no American actor could hate themselves\\" quite so well as the character needed. Barrie declined. In this series, Kryten was owned by the ship's Captain prior to the disaster that wiped out the crew, and passed the three million years by repeatedly reading a sign saying \\"FIRE EXIT\\" in a loop. The Kryten costume and make-up was redesigned so Robert Llewellyn was more comfortable while inside it.

However, in 1934 the liner Herefordshire, being towed to the breakers' yard, ran aground on the island in a storm, and rats made it ashore. Over a period of years they ate the eggs and chicks of nesting seabirds, and wiped out the island‚Äôs population of puffin and Manx shearwater, which have never returned. The wreck has attracted a wide variety of marine life and is a diving attraction. It was 45 years before the rat population was exterminated. Today, birds such as guillemots, razorbills, cormorants, shags, fulmars and a variety of sea-gulls all nest on the island. Bottlenose dolphins and Atlantic grey seals are also often seen in the sea around the island.

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical- shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells. Coccus refers to the shape of the bacteria, and can contain multiple genera, such as staphylococci or streptococci. Cocci can grow in pairs, chains, or clusters, depending on their orientation and attachment during cell division. Contrast to many bacilli-shaped bacteria, most cocci bacteria do not have flagella and are non-motile. Cocci is an English loanword of a modern or neo-Latin noun, which in turn stems from the Greek masculine noun c√≥ccos (Œ∫œåŒ∫Œ∫ŒøœÇ) meaning \\"berry\\". Structure Structure for cocci may vary between gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial wall types. The cell wall structure for cocci may vary between gram-positive (thick peptidoglycan layers) and gram-negative (thin peptidoglycan layers). While living in their host organism, cocci can be pathogenic (e.g., streptococcus), commensal, or symbiotic. Gram-positive Cocci The gram-positive cocci are a large group of loosely bacteria with similar morphology. All are spherical or nearly so, but they vary considerably in size. Members of some genera are identifiable by the way cells are attached to one another: in pockets, in chains, or grapes like clusters. These arrangements reflect patterns of cell division and the fact that cells stick together. Sarcina cells, for example, are arranged in cubical pockets because cell division alternates regularly among the three perpendicular planes. Streptococcus spp. resemble a string of beads because division always occurs in the same plane. Some of these strings, for example, S. pneumoniae, are only two cells long. They are called diplococci. Species of Staphylococcus have no regular plane of division. They form grape-like structures. The various gram- positive cocci differ physiologically and by habitat. Micrococcus spp. are obligate aerobes that inhabit human skin. Staphylococcus spp. also inhabit human skin, but they are facultative anaerobes. They ferment sugars, producing lactic acid as an end product. Many of these species produce carotenoid pigments, which color their colonies yellow or orange. Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen. It can infect almost any tissue in the body, frequently the skin. It often causes nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections.  Arrangements  Cocci may occur as single cells or remain attached following cell division. Those that remain attached can be classified based on cellular arrangement: *Diplococci are pairs of cocci (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae) *Streptococci are chains of cocci (e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes). *Staphylococci are irregular (grape- like) clusters of cocci (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus). *Tetrads are clusters of four cocci arranged within the same plane (e.g. Micrococcus sp.). *Sarcina is a genus of bacteria that are found in cuboidal arrangements of eight cocci (e.g. Sarcina ventriculi).

The track hosts both thoroughbred racing and harness racing. It is known popularly in the region as \\"The Big M\\". Meadowlands has year-round horse racing as well as a number of bars and restaurants. History Opened in the mid-1970s, Meadowlands Racetrack held its first-ever harness race on September 1, 1976, while thoroughbred racing commenced on September 6, 1977. With the exception of the opening season of 1976, autumn has been dedicated to the thoroughbreds, while the rest of the year features standardbreds, or harness horses. The advertising campaign that accompanied the start of thoroughbred racing at the Meadowlands in 1977 was noted for its use of the slogan \\"Racing with the Moon\\", originally popularized in 1941 by bandleader Vaughn Monroe (alluding to the fact that post-time is in the evening ‚Äì a circumstance that still pertains, although afternoon programs during long holiday weekends are occasionally put on). More recent advertising campaigns have included a direct and catchy approach to attending live racing: \\"It's All About Being Here ‚Äì The Meadowlands!\\" With its sweeping curves and wide stretches, the \\"Big M\\" has been known for exceptional times for harness racing. Opening night at the track featured the fastest harness mile run in New Jersey to that time, 1:55 by Rambling Willie. The world record for a mile by a standardbred, 1:46 by Lather Up, driven by Montrell Teague in the 2019 Graduate, matched Always B Miki's time at the Red Mile in Lexington. The Meadowlands Racetrack has been the site of the Hambletonian, the first leg of the Trotting Triple Crown, since 1981. It has also been home to the Cane Pace, the first leg of Harness Racing's Pacing Triple Crown since 2015 with the Cane run on the same program as the Hambletonian. Leading drivers in recent seasons have included Ron Pierce, Brian Sears, George Brennan, and Tim Tetrick. The track is operated by New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC with Jeff Gural as its CEO and chairman. Gural took over operations of the Meadowlands in December 2011. Ken Warkentin is the current race caller and announcer for the Meadowlands. Sam McKee was also the track announcer until he suffered a stroke days after calling what no one knew at the time would be the last card he ever would call on January 21, 2017, and passing away on March 7, 2017. Veteran sportscaster Dave Johnson, was the track's lead public-address announcer from its opening until the early 2000s. In July 2009, the Meadowlands Rail Line opened for event service, but is expected to run daily upon completion of the nearby American Dream Meadowlands. Bruton Smith, owner of Lowe's Motor Speedway and other motorsports racetracks, has long had his sights on Meadowlands Racetrack for possible conversion into a short track venue for NASCAR events in the New York City area. His most recent of several attempts to purchase the track failed in the late 1990s. A report issued in January 2010 by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie discussed the idea of closing the Meadowlands Racetrack and selling it for commercial development or converting it into a NASCAR facility. Governor Christie has considered selling or leasing the racetrack to a private operator or closing it altogether. The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority privatized the racetrack, to Jeffrey Gural of Newmark Knight Frank in December 2011. The privatization included $110 million of improvements consisting of a new 2,250-seat grandstand built on the site of the former backstretch. The existing grandstand was used as an event space for Super Bowl XLVIII.Official NFL Super Bowl Tailgate Party The old Meadowlands grandstand closed for racing on November 2, 2013. The new grandstand, which cost $110 million to build and can seat 2,200, opened for racing on November 23, 2013, with an estimated crowd of 15,000 in attendance. The Meadowlands was announced to host the championship final for the 2018 AMA Pro American Flat Track Championship motorcycle racing series, scheduled for October 6. The event, to be designated as the Meadowlands Mile, joins Turf Paradise, The Red Mile, Remington Park, and Canterbury Park as horse racing tracks that will run the series in 2018. In June 2018, Paddy Power Betfair announced that it had partnered with Meadowlands to open a sportsbook at the track, following the state's legalization of sports betting (as facilitated by the result of Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association). The sportsbook opened on July 14, 2018, under the branding of FanDuel, a daily fantasy sports service recently acquired by the company. Physical attributes The former grandstand, circa 2011 Like many racecourses in the United States, the main (dirt) track at the Meadowlands has a circumference; inside of this is a turf course (used by the thoroughbreds only) which is . With a span of exactly from the top of the stretch to the finish line and a distance of exactly from the finish line to the beginning of the first (clubhouse) turn, the dimensions of the track are considered \\"typical\\" or \\"standard\\" for an American racetrack. The main track is wide, while the width of the turf course is . The track is equipped to race at night and most of its races are at night. In the middle of the track is a lake, intended to resemble the state of New Jersey. The old grandstand, horse barns and site, was designed by the Philadelphia architectural firm of EwingCole (now known as Ewing Cole Cherry Brott), who also designed a number of other track facilities around the world as well as Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia (with Populous). The new grandstand opened for simulcasting on Monday, November 18, 2013. The official unveiling of the new grandstand was on November 23, 2013 for first night of live fall harness racing. The collaborative production by managing partner Jeff Gural and The Hard Rock spans 180,000 square feet across four floors and includes a track apron that holds up to 10,000 people. Notable drivers in attendance included John Campbell, Yannick Gingras, Scott Zeron and Tim Tetrick. Famed pacer Gallo Blue Chip kicked off the racing action with a ribbon cutting ceremony across the finish line. Accessibility and transportation Like the rest of the sports complex, Meadowlands Racetrack is accessible via Exit 16W on the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) which is located adjacent to NJ Route 3 and NJ Route 120. NJ Transit provides bus service on the 160 from the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the 703 on the Haledon/Paterson/East Rutherford route. NJ Transit also provides rail service on the Meadowlands Rail Line at the Meadowlands station. The Big M - Getting Here. Accessed May 23, 2019.

This led to civil litigation and criminal prosecutions. Crematorium founding Noble, Georgia, the location of the crematorium The crematorium was founded by Tommy Marsh in the mid-1970s and was located in the Noble community, north of the city of LaFayette in northwest Georgia. It provided cremation services for a number of funeral homes in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee, and made cremation an option for people in communities where it had previously been difficult to obtain. Marsh was a respected businessman. He once ran for Coroner of Walker County, losing by fewer than 100 votes. Marsh also ran other businesses offering tent rentals and vault construction. Marsh's health deteriorated in the mid-1990s. In mid- to-late 1996 his son, Ray Brent Marsh, took over operation of the business. During the pendency of the litigation filed against the Marsh family, Tommy Marsh died. Discovery and identification of the remains In early 2002, the United States Environmental Protection Agency office in Atlanta received an anonymous tip that something was amiss at Tri-State Crematory. The EPA officers sent to investigate the property discovered a skull and some bones that were human in origin. The original human skull and bones went missing later in the litigation and were never offered into evidence. Previously, a propane delivery truck driver had complained on at least two occasions to the Walker County Sheriff's Department about seeing bodies on the Marsh property. The driver made a fuel delivery and notified the sheriff's office. This call resulted in a deputy sheriff being called to the property, who reportedly discovered nothing unusual. On February 15, 2002, investigators returned to the property, finding piles of decomposing human bodies in a storage shed, in vaults and scattered inside and outside throughout the property. Atlanta television station WAGA/Fox 5 and reporter Dan Ronan were the first to break the news story after a nearby funeral home director called the station and informed Ronan that law enforcement officers were at the Marsh residence. In his first interview that afternoon with Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson, Ronan recalls the Sheriff told him within a few hours the story would be \\"on the front page of the New York Times and the lead story on the evening newscasts.\\" Ronan and WAGA's other reporters would spend nearly a month in Walker County before finally going home. A federal disaster team was brought into the area along with a portable morgue shipped from Maryland. The team began trying to identify the remains, a process made difficult because many of the corpses were in advanced stages of decomposition. Some were little more than skeletons. Experts hired by the Marsh attorneys, Stuart James and Frank Jenkins, were prepared to testify that the methods of recovery were questionable and that the methods were made more difficult because of the lack of trained experts undertaking the investigation on the Marsh property. The experts, however, never testified because the civil cases against Tri-State and the funeral homes that had used Tri-State to perform cremation settled after a second trial had begun in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Between 1996 and the date of the discovery, more than 2,000 bodies had been sent to Tri-State. The search ultimately recovered 339 uncremated bodies. Of the 339 bodies that were discovered, 226 were identified. DNA testing was possible in those cases where a living relative was available, but in other cases, it was considered unlikely officials would ever be able to identify the remains. Failure to cremate At some point after Ray Brent Marsh took over the business, he apparently had issues in performing cremations. It was not clear why this was the case. Out of nearly 2000 bodies received by Brent Marsh, 339 went uncremated. Families of the deceased were given concrete dust instead of cremated remains. In response to Marsh's claim that the cremation oven, or \\"retort,\\" was broken, the oven was tested and found to be in working order, although subsequent examinations by experts did find faults. Several crematory operators at the time commented that even if the machine had broken down, proper maintenance would have kept the incinerator working, noting that most oven manufacturers have regular maintenance programs available. Criminal prosecution Ray Brent Marsh was arrested on over 300 criminal violations and was ultimately charged by the State of Georgia with 787 counts, including theft by deception, abusing a corpse, burial service related fraud and giving false statements. Marsh was facing a possible prison sentence of thousands of years. Marsh was represented by McCracken Poston (who a few years before had been the lawyer for Alvin \\"The Zenith Man\\" Ridley) from nearby Ringgold, Georgia, and Ron Cordova of Newport Beach, California. Cordova was a former Orange County, California prosecutor and, like Poston, had served in the state legislature. Both Poston and Cordova are experienced criminal lawyers who first teamed up two years earlier in the trial of Byron Looper for the murder of a Tennessee state senator. The criminal cases against Marsh were settled after the Georgia Supreme Court had certified for review the defense question of whether a human corpse had any pecuniary value, an issue vital to the case in order to determine if the thefts could even be criminally prosecuted. The traditional common law holding is that a corpse does not have pecuniary value. Marsh eventually pleaded guilty was sentenced to twelve years in prison, with credit for the time he had spent in custody before obtaining pretrial release on bond. He was released from Central State Prison in Bibb County on June 29, 2016. Litigation Almost 1,700 members of the families of the identified corpses sued Tri-State and the funeral homes that had shipped the bodies there, and were eventually granted class-action status in two courts in two different states. Class-action status was granted by Judge Neil Thomas in Hamilton County Tennessee Circuit Court. This case was filed by Nashville attorney David Randolph Smith. Smith associated Chattanooga defense attorney Phil Fleissner to act as co-counsel with Smith for the class. Judge Harold Murphy in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia also granted class-action status after the filing of the plaintiff's master complaint. The class certification hearings resulted in certification of a class action after hearings were held in Hamilton County, Tennessee in front of Judge Neal Thomas. Judge Thomas, and the Oden class action, certified the numerous cases pending in the State of Tennessee as a class action. The Tennessee class action proceeded with various hearings and motions being filed before the plaintiff class ultimately decided to proceed with the class-action filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The class-action in the state of Tennessee was ultimately decertified by Judge Thomas after it was made clear that the class representative, Oden, chose to participate in the class action pending in the State of Georgia. There were numerous reasons why the class was decertified, one of them apparently being that Oden, as a class representative, made an election to participate in the national class action pending in Rome Georgia. Most of the cases filed in Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama chose to participate in the class-action and Rome Georgia. Two trials occurred, with witnesses testifying in both trials. The trials were open to the public, and were widely reported by the news media with numerous people testifying including Dr. Kris Sperry of the Georgia Bureau of investigation. The transcripts are public record; neither trial proceeded very far before settlements were reached. The funeral homes sued Tri-State and Marsh, eventually settling first for $36 million with the plaintiff's class in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Ultimately, the Marsh defendants also settled for $3.5 million after their insurer, Georgia Farm Bureau, agreed to pay the settlement. After heated negotiations among the attorneys regarding the exact terms and conditions of the settlement, the settlement failed. The parties could not effectuate a settlement that would globally resolve all cases in Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. The plaintiff class filed a Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement alleging a settlement agreement had been reached between the parties, and that the court should enforce the settlement agreement. Stuart James and Frank Jenkins responded to the motion asserting that the settlement could not be effectuated and that the parties never could complete the settlement due to the inability to reach an agreement to put together a settlement class globally resolving the cases. Judge Harold Murphy of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia thereafter ordered a second trial. The second trial began in August 2004. Bill Brown, an attorney in Bradley County Tennessee, chose not to participate in the class actions. In his cases, Akers, Burns & Hall, Brown alleged various causes of action against Marsh, Tri-State Crematory, and the funeral homes. During the second trial in August 2004, the families settled with the Marsh family by agreeing to a conservation easement on the Marsh property and an uncollectable judgment against the Marsh family for $80 million, subject to a state court's pending determination that the incident was actually covered by the family's homeowner's policy. Stuart James and Frank Jenkins, the attorneys for the Marsh family in the civil litigation, crafted a judgment that was not collectable against any of the Marsh defendants. Therefore, the plaintiffs' class filed a claim against Georgia Farm Bureau in State Court, that claim settled in late 2007 for $18 million resulting in the $80 million judgment being set aside and a settlement of $18 million going to the plaintiff's class members. Georgia Farm Bureau was represented by Duke Groover and Ben Land of the State of Georgia. Georgia Farm Bureau is paying the settlement under a homeowner's policy of insurance. Much of the earlier settlement with the funeral homes has been paid. The Marsh family has not paid any amount to the plaintiff's class, and agreed to set aside an acre of land as a conservation easement, keeping the land in a natural state in remembrance of those who were found on the property. The public does not have access to the land, and the land remains titled in the Marsh family name. Several claims remain in Tennessee. Claims that are being handled by plaintiffs' attorney Bill Brown and by Terri Crawford have been dismissed by Judge Neil Thomas and the dismissal upheld by the Tennessee Court of Appeals. Brown and Crawford have requested the Tennessee Supreme Court to review the dismissal of the claims. Stuart James represents Brent Marsh in these appeals and the Tennessee Supreme Court has denied the request for appeal. The cases are dismissed pursuant to the legal findings of the Tennessee Court of Appeals in the Crawford v. Buckner Rush & Marsh decision. Brown, on behalf of certain plaintiffs living in Bradley County, Tennessee, has also fought to require Brent Marsh to testify in court on the claims that remain in the Bradley County Circuit Court in Cleveland, Tennessee. Brown asserted that it was time for Marsh to tell family members what happened to their loved ones' bodies, offering an explanation of what he did and what happened to those bodies. Judge Neil Thomas, to whom the Tennessee civil cases have been specially assigned, held that Marsh had waived his Fifth Amendment privilege upon pleading guilty to more than 700 felony counts in the State of Georgia. After consulting with his client's criminal law lawyers, Ken Poston and Ron Cordova, Stuart James argued that the circumstances of the claim permitted Marsh to continue to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege. Judge Thomas' ruling that Marsh had waived his privilege was appealed to the Tennessee Court of Appeals with the Court of Appeals reversing and remanding the issue of the Fifth Amendment to Judge Thomas for further consideration. The Court of Appeals held that Marsh could assert his Fifth Amendment privilege in any testimony subject to review by Judge Thomas. No further testimony has been solicited by Brown. Walker County, Georgia has also sued the Marsh family to recover the cost of its investigation into the incidents on the Marsh property. Walker County claims that it is entitled to recover almost $2 million resulting from its investigation. Frank Jenkins and Stuart James[2] have represented the Marsh defendants in this litigation which resulted in the Walker County Superior Court, Judge Smith sitting specially, dismissing the claims. The Georgia Court of Appeals heard oral argument and issued an opinion upholding the dismissal of the claims. Walker County, through its attorneys Coppedge & Evans, amended its complaint to allege that Walker County was cleaning up an environmental hazard and is therefore entitled to recover damages. The environmental claim was also dismissed by Judge Smith, and the issues regarding the environmental claim are currently pending in the Georgia Court of Appeals. The Georgia Court of Appeals recently ruled that Walker County Georgia does not have a claim under Georgia's Hazardous Site Response Act. The court ruled that the county had no standing to bring any legal claim for environmental cleanup. The attorneys for Walker County have applied asking the Georgia Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals decision. The Petition for Certiorari was denied by the Georgia Supreme Court. Walker County filed a motion for reconsideration with the Georgia spring court after they denied the County permission to appeal to the spring court. The motion was denied by the Court. All lawsuits filed by Walker County Georgia have been dismissed in the claims are now at a conclusion. The pleadings involved in this appeal including the rulings of the court may be found at LegalEase. The Tennessee Supreme Court has also dismissed all claims maintained by people who are classified as non-next of kin, stating that non-next of kin have no standing to bring a claim under Tennessee law. One of the non-next of kin claims was maintained by Terri Crawford. Crawford has been outspoken regarding these cases, and at one point during the investigation was employed by the state of Georgia and the federal government as a part of the investigative team. She later brought a claim to recover money for the loss of her brother's body. After consideration by the Tennessee Court of Appeals and review by the Tennessee Supreme Court Miss Crawford's claim was dismissed and was ultimately dismissed by Judge Neil Thomas pursuant to the order of the Tennessee Court of Appeals and the order of the Tennessee Supreme Court denying any further appeal on behalf of Crawford. Under Tennessee law, non-next of kin may not bring a claim under the circumstances as alleged by plaintiffs across the state of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. Under Tennessee law only next of kin may maintain a claim. Therefore, if the deceased is survived by a spouse the spouse has a claim and no other family member has a claim. The Tennessee Court of Appeals has outlined a succession of who may be a next of kin depending on which next of kin survives the deceased. The ruling of the Court of Appeals resulted in a dismissal of numerous non-next of kin cases. However, several claims are being maintained in Bradley County Tennessee Bill Brown, the attorney for some claimants who are classified as next-of-kin or persons who have a contract right, has fought to have Brent Marsh testify in deposition. Stuart James, the attorney for Brent Marsh, has resisted the deposition, asserting that the Fifth Amendment Privilege is still available to Marsh due to the circumstances of the case. The issue involving whether Marsh still may maintain his Fifth Amendment privilege has been appealed to the Tennessee Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals sent the case back for further consideration by Judge Neil Thomas on whether the Fifth Amendment is still available to Marsh. The Court of Appeals ruled that Marsh does not have a blanket loss of his Fifth Amendment privilege and that the trial court should review the privilege on a question by question basis to see if the privilege is still available to Marsh. The legal issues continue in these cases, and there may be issues that will take the cases back into the appellate court system of Tennessee. Motives and aftermath The motives behind Brent Marsh's actions are unclear, as it would have been far less trouble simply to cremate the remains than to dump them. His statement in court when pleading guilty did nothing to clarify: \\"To those of you who may have come here today looking for answers, I cannot give you.\\" Legal issues presented in the case are novel, including the crafting of the charges against Marsh. Buzz Franklin, the District Attorney of Walker County Georgia, created law in bringing indictments against Marsh. In creating the legal basis for the indictments 787 federal charges were lodged against Marsh. At one point in the criminal case an appeal was pending before the Georgia Supreme Court on certain issues created by the District Attorney in prosecuting Marsh. However, Marsh was able to reach a settlement of the civil class action cases and the criminal charges against him which was later approved by Judge James Bodiford (the judge who presided over the criminal cases in Georgia) and Judge Harold Murphy (the Federal Judge who provided over in the class action cases pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia at Rome Georgia). Litigation continues in the State of Tennessee against Marsh, where he continues to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination due to the unique nature of the charges that were against him, the unique nature of the sentence against him, and the unique nature of the civil claims pending in the State of Tennessee. The cases in Tennessee have been on appeal on issues relating to who may bring a claim and on Fifth Amendment issues. Many of the claims are dismissed, but some remain in the issues of law surrounding the claims are still very much alive and under legal debate. All of the claims pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia are resolved. The remainder of claims pending in Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama have either been dismissed or resolved. The claim filed by Walker County Georgia is currently under review by the Georgia Supreme Court on whether the court will accept an appeal and there are some claims in Bradley County Tennessee waiting trial pending any legal argument and subsequent appeal. This case throughout its pendency in both civil and criminal courts presented unique legal arguments and challenges for the attorneys involved in the litigation. Attorneys examined documentation that was gathered in the criminal investigation that exceeded 100,000 pages of documents, revealing methods of identification, the methodology used in investigating the claim, videos of the investigation, and numerous photographs. At one point a skull and an arm were discovered in the criminal files, both with human tissue on them. Prosecutors stated that the skull and arm were intentionally a part of the files, but after they were discovered the skull and arm were quickly removed. In the end, all parties felt that they reached fair settlement of the litigation which included settlements of the class action cases, most of the individual cases, the criminal cases relating to identified bodies, leaving only a few claims in Bradley County Tennessee. As part of the settlement reached, by spring 2005 all buildings on the Tri-State property were razed. The property will remain in a trust so that it will be preserved in peace and dignity as a secluded memorial to those whose remains were mistreated, and to prevent crematory operations or other inappropriate activities from ever taking place there. Brent Marsh was sentenced to concurrent sentences in Georgia and Tennessee for all the criminal charges related to the incident. He received a sentence of twelve years in prison as well as seventy-five years of probation in Georgia. The sentence was the product of a plea bargain which was reached contemporaneously with the settlement of the civil litigation. McCracken Poston and Ron Cordova crafted the plea agreement while Stuart James, Frank Jenkins and Robert Smalley concluded a settlement of the federal civil action after a series of meetings in Rome, Georgia which also included Poston and the District Attorney prosecuting the Georgia state criminal case against Marsh. The global settlement ended the federal class lawsuit as well as the criminal cases in Georgia and Tennessee. On February 7, 2007, a week before the five- year anniversary of the discoveries at the former crematory, the criminal defense attorneys for Marsh revealed that physiological testing had indicated that Brent Marsh was a victim of mercury toxicity from the cremation of bodies with mercury dental amalgam. They stated that a faulty ventilation system exposed both Marsh and his father to toxic levels of mercury. On June 29, 2016, Ray Brent Marsh was released from Central State Prison in Bibb County, Georgia, after serving his full 12-year sentence. Failures of inspection, regulation and enforcement The Cremation Society of North America commented in response to the case that funeral homes should use only reputable crematoria for cremation of remains, and only crematoria that they trust. The Society called the treatment of remains at Tri-State \\"an abuse of the most sacred trust\\" placed in the funeral service industry, a sentiment echoed by others in the industry. Many in the funeral industry and government pointed to a lack of regulation and inspection as a factor contributing to the incident. Many of the funeral homes never inspected the crematory to learn its operating procedures, and never ensured that cremations were actually being carried out. Although the state of Georgia had pertinent regulations, a loophole in the law allowed crematories like Tri-State who dealt only with funeral homes to operate without a license, allowing them to go without state inspection. The state has since moved to tighten its regulations. The Tri-State incident was representative of a larger regulatory laxity regarding crematoria in the United States. Regulation in some parts of the country had been weak; some states had no regulation at all, and except for EPA emissions regulations, many crematoria had been essentially unregulated. In Michigan, for example, a change in the law was sought by a legislator who was also a funeral director, after discovering that negligent disposal of a body was not a crime in that state. Further, even where regulation was in place lack of enforcement often remained a problem, as in Ohio which was unable to enforce its laws for a time due to a lack of trained inspectors. In popular culture The Tri-State Crematory incident was used as the basis for a Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode \\"Dead\\" (Season 2, episode 1) starring Kathryn Erbe and Vincent D'Onofrio. The case was also the backdrop for the 2011 film Sahkanaga, a fictionalized account of the events by American filmmaker John Henry Summerour,http://www.sahkanaga.com and provided inspiration for the CSI: Miami episode \\"Forced Entry\\". Brent Hendricks' memoir, A Long Day at the End of the World: A Story of Desecration and Revelation in the Deep South (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2013), traces his quest to discover whether his father's remains were among those discovered at the crematory.

Muller (1977), LATE GLACIAL AND EARLY POSTGLACIAL ENVIRONMENTS IN WESTERN NEW YORK Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 288 (1), 223‚Äì233. The lake existed on the southern (upper) side of the Niagara Escarpment east of the present course of the Niagara River between Early Lake Erie to the south and Glacial Lake Iroquois (the ancestor of Lake Ontario) to the north. During the retreat of the glaciers, the water levels of the Great Lakes were higher. Lake Tonawanda was created and fed by the elevated waters of Lake Erie. Lake Tonawanda itself was drained into Lake Ontario by a series of falls over the escarpment, including one at present day Lockport, New York. The lake evaporated when the waters of Lake Erie dropped below the level of the feeder streams to the lake. Subsequently Lake Erie drained over the escarpment entirely through Niagara Falls, which marks roughly the western terminus of the former lake bed. The remains of the previous falls, which rivaled Niagara Falls in grandeur, can be seen along the escarpment. The sinking of homes in the lakebed has been an ongoing problem in communities such as Amherst, New York.

Taking the form of a monologue by a middle-aged, working class Liverpool housewife, it focuses on her life before and after a transforming holiday abroad. Plot Wondering what has happened to her youth and feeling stagnant and in a rut, Shirley finds herself regularly alone and talking to the wall while preparing an evening meal of egg and chips for her emotionally distant husband. When her best friend offers to pay for a trip-for-two to Greece, she packs her bags, leaves a note on the cupboard door in the kitchen, and heads for a fortnight of rest and relaxation. In Greece, with just a little effort on her part, she rediscovers everything she had been missing about her existence in England. She finds so much happiness, in fact, that when the vacation is over she decides not to return, ditching her friend at the airport and going back to the hotel where she'd been staying to ask for a job and to live a newly self- confident life in which she is at last true to herself. Productions Commissioned by the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool, the play premiered in 1986, with Noreen Kershaw directed by Glen Walford. Two years later it opened in London's West End at the Vaudeville Theatre, with Pauline Collins directed by Simon Callow. After eight previews, the Broadway production, with Collins again directed by Callow, opened on 16 February 1989 at the Booth Theatre, where it ran for 324 performances. Ellen Burstyn replaced Collins later in the run, and Loretta Swit starred in a US national tour in 1995. From 26 March - 8 May 2010, as part of the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory, Meera Syal played Shirley in the production's first London West End revival. A West End transfer of the Menier Chocolate Factory production ran at the Trafalgar Studios from 20 July - 30 October 2010. Meera Syal reprised her role as Shirley; this production was adapted and broadcast by BBC Radio Four in 2010 and 2017. A 30th Anniversary Tour, starring Jodie Prenger ran in the UK from March 2017 to November 2017. Prenger was met with rave reviews.

He stated in 2009 that he had approximately 30 \\"solid\\" followers. Bawden was elected by a group of six laypeople, which included himself and his parents, who had come to believe that the Catholic Church had apostatized from the Catholic faith since Vatican II, and that there had been no legitimate popes elected since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958.

Bawden attended the SSPX seminary in √âc√¥ne, Switzerland, and Saint Joseph's Priory in Armada, Michigan, but was dismissed from the seminary in 1978.  Claim to the papacy  Bawden believes that all the popes since the death of Pope Pius XII on October 9, 1958, are modernists, heretics, and apostates, and that, therefore, their elections are invalid. He considers them to have incurred latae sententiae, or automatic, excommunication, not so much for violating Pope Pius X's laws, as the laws of God. Bawden says he was elected to the papacy in 1990, in a papal conclave attended by five other people, including his parents. It appears he tried to contact more people to take part.Vatican in Exile FAQ  Media appearances  In 2010, independent filmmaker Adam Fairholm created a feature-length documentary, Pope Michael.

Upaya is often used with kaushalya (‡§ï‡•å‡§∂‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø, \\"cleverness\\"), upaya- kaushalya meaning \\"skill in means\\". Upaya-kaushalya is a concept emphasizing that practitioners may use their own specific methods or techniques that fit the situation in order to gain enlightenment. The implication is that even if a technique, view, etc., is not ultimately \\"true\\" in the highest sense, it may still be an expedient practice to perform or view to hold; i.e., it may bring the practitioner closer to the true realization in a similar way. The exercise of skill to which it refers, the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon.\\"It is true that the term translated 'skill in means', upaya-kausalya , is post-canonical, but the exercise of skill to which it refers, the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon.\\" How Buddhism Began, Richard F. Gombrich, Munshiram Manoharlal, 1997, p. 17. The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism notes that rendering the Chinese term fƒÅngbi√†n into English as 'skillful' or as 'expedient' is often difficult, because the connotations shift according to the context as (1) the teaching being something to marvel at ‚Äî the fact that the Buddha can present these difficult truths in everyday language (thus, skillful), yet that (2) they are teachings of a lower order as compared to the ultimate truth, and are far removed from reflecting reality, and are a kind of 'stopgap' measure (thus, expedient).In colloquial usage, fangbian can also mean \\"go to the toilet\\" (e.g., literal \\"large\\" and \\"small\\" conveniences are dabian Â§ß‰æø \\"defecation\\" and xiaobian Â∞è‰æø \\"urination\\"). See Victor Mair's \\"Linguistic Advice in the Lavatory\\". Role and function of Upaya One consequence of this is that it is possible to endorse a form of Buddhist practice as viable while simultaneously critiquing its premises or contrasting it unfavorably to another, higher practice. In some Mahayana texts, such as the Lotus Sutra, this is used as a polemic device against prior Buddhist traditions; it is said that the Buddha gave them various upayas rather than revealing the ultimate truth, for which they were not ready. Gregory frames the hermeneutical classification of Buddhist schools (Chinese p√†nji√†o Âà§Êïô \\"doctrinal classification\\") as an \\"expedient means:\\" > The doctrine of expedient means provided the main hermeneutical device by > which Chinese Buddhists systematically ordered the Buddha's teachings in > their classificatory schemes. It enabled them to arrange the teachings in > such a way that each teaching served as an expedient measure to overcome the > particular shortcoming of the teaching that preceded it while, at the same > time, pointing to the teaching that was to supersede it. In this fashion a > hierarchical progression of teachings could be constructed, starting with > the most elementary and leading to the most profound.Gregory, Peter N. > (1999) Chinese Cultural Studies: Doctrinal Classification. Source: > (unpaginated), accessed: January 28, 2008 The most important concept in skill in means is the use, guided by wisdom and compassion, of a specific teaching (means) geared to the particular audience taught. Edward Conze, in A Short History Of Buddhism, says \\"'Skill in means' is the ability to bring out the spiritual potentialities of different people by statements or actions which are adjusted to their needs and adapted to their capacity for comprehension.\\" The concept of skillfulness is prominent in Mahayana Buddhism with regards to the actions of a bodhisattva. The idea is that a bodhisattva or practitioner may use any expedient methods in order to help ease the suffering of people, introduce them to the dharma, or help them on their road to nirvana. In chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha describes how the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara changes his form to meet the needs of the student. If a monk is needed, the Bodhisattva becomes a monk for example. This doctrine is sometimes used to explain some of the otherwise strange or unorthodox behavior or 'crazy wisdom' (Tib.: yeshe ch√∂lwa) engaged in by some Buddhists and exemplified in the conduct of the Tibetan Mahasiddha. Skillful means may theoretically be used by different buddhist groups to make many seemingly proscribed practices, such as violence, theft, and sexuality be employed as skillful. The use of harsh violence to one's disciples has occasionally been used as a way of opening their eyes to the nature of self and suffering; an example is the story of a Zen priest who ended a conversation with a disciple by slamming shut a door on the disciple's leg, fracturing the leg and, according to the story, causing a deep insight in the disciple. There are a number of other stories of Buddhist saints and bodhisattvas taking part in fairly eccentric and unusual behaviors in the practice of skillful means. The practices and rituals of Vajrayana Buddhism are also often interpreted as a process of skillful means. They are understood to be means whereby practitioners use the very misconceptions and properties of mundane existence to help themselves reach enlightenment. Images and examples Buddhist texts metaphorically explain the upaya concept through illustrations such as a burning house and an empty fist. =Parable of the burning house= The Lotus Sutra contains a famous upaya story about using the expedient means of white lies to rescue children from a burning building. Note that this parable describes three yana \\"vehicles; carts\\" drawn by goats, deer, and oxen, which is a Mahayanist wordplay upon classifying the Sutrayana Schools of Buddhism into the Hearer's Vehicle (Sravakayana), Solitary Conqueror's Vehicle (Pratyekabuddhayana), and the Bodhisattva's Vehicle (Mahayana). Gautama Buddha elucidates upaya to his disciple Shariputra. > \\"Shariputra, suppose that in a certain town in a certain country there was a > very rich man. He was far along in years and his wealth was beyond measure. > He had many fields, houses and menservants. His own house was big and > rambling, but it had only one gate. A great many people‚Äîa hundred, two > hundred, perhaps as many as five hundred‚Äîlived in the house. The halls and > rooms were old and decaying, the walls crumbling, the pillars rotten at > their base, and the beams and rafters crooked and aslant. At that time a > fire suddenly broke out on all sides, spreading through the rooms of the > house. The sons of the rich man, ten, twenty perhaps thirty, were inside the > house. When the rich man saw the huge flames leaping up on every side, he > was greatly alarmed and fearful and thought to himself, I can escape to > safety through the flaming gate, but my sons are inside the burning house > enjoying themselves and playing games, unaware, unknowing, without alarm or > fear. The fire is closing in on them, suffering and pain threaten them, yet > their minds have no sense of loathing or peril and they do not think of > trying to escape! \\"Shariputra, this rich man thought to himself, I have > strength in my body and arms. I can wrap them in a robe or place them on a > bench and carry them out of the house. And then again he thought, this house > has only one gate, and moreover it is narrow and small. My sons are very > young, they have no understanding, and they love their games, being so > engrossed in them that they are likely to be burned in the fire. I must > explain to them why I am fearful and alarmed. The house is already in flames > and I must get them out quickly and not let them be burned up in the fire! > Having thought in this way, he followed his plan and called to all his sons, > saying, 'You must come out at once!\\" But though the father was moved by pity > and gave good words of instruction, the sons were absorbed in their games > and unwilling to heed them. They had no alarm, no fright, and in the end no > mind to leave the house. Moreover, they did not understand what the fire > was, what the house was, what the danger was. They merely raced about this > way and that in play and looked at their father without heeding him. \\"At > that time the rich man had this thought: the house is already in flames from > this huge fire. If I and my sons do not get out at once, we are certain to > be burned. I must now invent some expedient means that will make it possible > for the children to escape harm. The father understood his sons and knew > what various toys and curious objects each child customarily liked and what > would delight them. And so he said to them, 'The kind of playthings you like > are rare and hard to find. If you do not take them when you can, you will > surely regret it later. For example, things like these goat-carts, deer- > carts and ox-carts. They are outside the gate now where you can play with > them. So you must come out of this burning house at once. Then whatever ones > you want, I will give them all to you!' \\"At that time, when the sons heard > their father telling them about these rare playthings, because such things > were just what they had wanted, each felt emboldened in heart and, pushing > and shoving one another, they all came wildly dashing out of the burning > house.Watson, Burton, tr. (1993). The Lotus Sutra. Columbia University > Press, New York. Translations from the Asian Classics. , pp. 56-57. The father subsequently presents each of his sons with a large bejeweled carriage drawn by a pure white ox. When the Buddha asks Shariputra whether the father was guilty of falsehood, he answers. > \\"No, World-Honored One. This rich man simply made it possible for his sons > to escape the peril of fire and preserve their lives. He did not commit a > falsehood. Why do I say this? Because if they were able to preserve their > lives, then they had already obtained a plaything of sorts. And how much > more so when, through an expedient means, they are rescued from that burning > house!\\"Watson, Burton, tr. (1993). The Lotus Sutra. Columbia University > Press, New York. Translations from the Asian Classics. , p. 58. The Buddha explains his similes of the father representing a compassionate TathƒÅgata who is like \\"a father to all the world\\", and the sons representing humans who are \\"born into the threefold world, a burning house, rotten, and old\\". > \\"Shariputra, that rich man first used three types of carriages to entice his > sons, but later he gave them just the large carriage adorned with jewels, > the safest, most comfortable kind of all. Despite this, that rich man was > not guilty of falsehood. The Tathagata does the same, and he is without > falsehood. First he preaches the three vehicles to attract and guide living > beings, but later he employs just the Great Vehicle to save them. Why? The > Tathagata possesses measureless wisdom, power, freedom from fear, the > storehouse of the Dharma. He is capable of giving to all living beings the > Dharma of the Great Vehicle. But not all of them are capable of receiving > it. Shariputra, for this reason you should understand that the Buddhas > employ the power of expedient means. And because they do so, they make > distinctions in the one Buddha vehicle and preach it as three.\\"Watson, > Burton, tr. (1993). The Lotus Sutra. Columbia University Press, New York. > Translations from the Asian Classics. , p. 60. =The empty fist= Another common metaphor for upaya is that of \\"the empty fist\\". A father holds up his empty fist saying there is something inside it to get the attention of the crying children. Sometimes the fist is holding golden leaves to give the impression that something made of gold is held inside. This is a favorite image of Zen teachers as it eloquently expresses in image the reason behind the necessity for upaya, that is, sunyata, all component things are empty. From the Zen point of view an essential teaching of Buddhism is that all assertions of any kind, even the highest concepts of Buddhism itself such as the Trikaya, are simply expedient means to bring the hearer to the realization of emptiness. But because many people are afraid of emptiness or disdain the idea of emptiness, various upaya must be used to get the student's attention to focus on the essence of mind rather than upon the distractions of mind. Here's an example from the Record of Zen master Linji Yixuan: > One asked: \\"What is the realm of the Three Eyes?\\" The master said: \\"I enter > with you the realm of utter purity, wear the robe of purity and expound the > Dharmakaya Buddha. Or we enter the realm of non-differentiation and expound > the Sambhogakaya Buddha. Or again, we enter the realm of deliverance, wear > the robe of radiance and speak of the Nirmanakaya Buddha. The realms of the > Three Eyes depend on change. To explain it from the point of the Sutras and > Treatises, the Dharmakaya is the fundamental. The Sambhogakaya and the > Nirmanakaya are the functions. But as I see it, the Dharmakaya cannot > expound (or comprehend) the Dharma. Thus an old master said: \\"The (Buddha's) > bodies are set up with reference to meaning; The (Buddha's) realms are > differentiated with reference to the bodies.\\" The nature of the bodies and > of the realms is clear; they are the temple of the Dharma, and so are only > relative. \\"Yellow leaves in the empty fist to entice unweaned children.\\" > Spikes of water-chestnuts ‚Äî what juice are you looking for in those dry > bones? There is no Dharma outside the heart [i.e., mind], nor anything to > find inside. So what are you looking for? Contemporary mindfulness-based interventions and upaya The recent rise of mindfulness-based interventions has led to debates as to just how much these short-termed programs convey the essence of the Buddhist path. On the one hand, scholars like Jon Kabat-Zinn can be viewed as having secularized the practice and hence having made it accessible to a population who would never think of trying it had it been rendered in Buddhist terms. On the other hand, critics such as Glen Wallis, Ron Purser, David Loy and others have strongly rejected the mindfulness movement in the ways that it has become a commodified version of the practice. Mindfulness-based interventions in schools and educational institutions have also been discussed within these contexts. Some argue that these programs must be grounded in the origins of the practice's ethics. Ergas, Oren (2017) Reconstructing 'education' through mindful attention. London: Palgrave Macmillan.

Life Edmonds was born in Boonville, New York. In 1919 he entered The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut. Originally intending to study chemical engineering, he became more interested in writing and worked as managing editor of the Choate Literary Magazine.

It may also consist of heating and forcing the metals together with presses or other means, creating enough pressure to cause plastic deformation at the weld surfaces.Production Technology (Manufacturing Processes): Manufacturing Processes by P C Sharma  S. Chand & Co. 2014 Page 369 The process is one of the simplest methods of joining metals and has been used since ancient times. Forge welding is versatile, being able to join a host of similar and dissimilar metals. With the invention of electrical and gas welding methods during the Industrial Revolution, manual forge-welding has been largely replaced, although automated forge-welding is a common manufacturing process. Introduction Forge welding is a process of joining metals by heating them beyond a certain threshold and forcing them together with enough pressure to cause deformation of the weld surfaces, creating a metallic bond between the atoms of the metals. The pressure required varies, depending on the temperature, strength, and hardness of the alloy.Production Technology (Manufacturing Processes): Manufacturing Processes by P C Sharma  S. Chand & Co. 2014 Page 369 Forge welding is the oldest welding technique, and has been used since ancient times. Welding processes can generally be grouped into two categories: fusion and diffusion welding. Fusion welding involves localized melting of the metals at the weld interfaces, and is common in electric or gas welding techniques. This requires temperatures much higher than the melting point of the metal in order to cause localized melting before the heat can thermally conduct away from the weld, and often a filler metal is used to keep the weld from segregating due to the high surface tension. Diffusion welding consists of joining the metals without melting them, welding the surfaces together while in the solid state.Manual of Engineering Drawing: Technical Product Specification and documentation to British and International Standards by Colin H. Simmons, Dennis E. Maguire  Elsevier 2009 Page 233 In diffusion welding, the heat source is often lower than the melting point of the metal, allowing more even heat-distribution thus reducing thermal stresses at the weld. In this method a filler metal is typically not used, but the weld occurs directly between the metals at the weld interface. This includes methods such as cold welding, explosion welding, and forge welding. Unlike other diffusion methods, in forge welding the metals are heated to a high temperature before forcing them together, usually resulting in greater plasticity at the weld surfaces. This generally makes forge welding more versatile than cold- diffusion techniques, which are usually performed on soft metals like copper or aluminum.Manual of Engineering Drawing: Technical Product Specification and documentation to British and International Standards by Colin H. Simmons, Dennis E. Maguire  Elsevier 2009 Page 233 In forge welding, the entire welding areas are heated evenly. Forge welding can be used for a much wider range of harder metals and alloys, like steel and titanium.Manual of Engineering Drawing: Technical Product Specification and documentation to British and International Standards by Colin H. Simmons, Dennis E. Maguire  Elsevier 2009 Page 233 History Sponge iron used to forge a Japanese katana. The history of joining metals goes back to the Bronze Age, where bronzes of different hardness were often joined by casting-in. This method consisted of placing a solid part into a molten metal contained in a mold and allowing it to solidify without actually melting both metals, such as the blade of a sword into a handle or the tang of an arrowhead into the tip. Brazing and soldering were also common during the Bronze Age.Introduction to Welding and Brazing by R. L. Apps, D. R. Milner  Pergamon Press 1994 Page x1 The act of welding (joining two solid parts through diffusion) began with iron. The first welding process was forge welding, which started when humans learned to smelt iron from iron ore; most likely in Anatolia (Turkey) around 1800 BC. Ancient people could not create temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, so the bloomery process that was used for smelting iron produced a lump (bloom) of iron grains sintered together with small amounts of slag and other impurities, referred to as sponge iron because of its porosity. After smelting the sponge iron needed to be heated above the welding temperature and hammered, or \\"wrought.\\" This squeezed out air pockets and melted slag, bringing the iron grains into close contact to form a solid block (billet). Many items made of wrought iron have been found by archeologists, that show evidence of forge welding, which date from before 1000 BC. Because iron was typically made in small amounts, any large object, such as the Delhi Pillar, needed to be forge welded out of smaller billets.Welding by Richard Lofting  Crowood Press 2013 Page 1History of Humanity: From the seventh century B.C. to the seventh century A.D. by Sigfried J. de Laet, Joachim Herrmann  Routledge 1996 Page 3637 Forge welding grew from a trial-and-error method, becoming more refined over the centuries.Introduction to Welding and Brazing by R. L. Apps, D. R. Milner  Pergamon Press 1994 Page xi Due to the poor quality of ancient metals, it was commonly employed in making composite steels, by joining high-carbon steels, that would resist deformation but break easily, with low-carbon steels, which resist fracture but bend too easily, creating an object with greater toughness and strength than could be produced with a single alloy. This method of pattern welding first appeared around 700 BC, and was primarily used for making weapons such as swords; the most widely known examples being Damascene, Japanese and Merovingian. The History of Hardening by Hans Berns  Harterei Gerster AG 2013 Page 4849 A History of Metallography by Cyril Stanley Smith  MIT Press 1960 Page 35 This process was also common in the manufacture of tools, from wrought-iron plows with steel edges to iron chisels with steel cutting surfaces. Materials Many metals can be forge welded, with the most common being both high and low- carbon steels. Iron and even some hypoeutectic cast-irons can be forge welded. Some aluminum alloys can also be forge welded.Principles of Welding: Processes, Physics, Chemistry, and Metallurgy by Robert W. Messler, Jr.  Wiley VCH 2008 Page 102 Metals such as copper, bronze and brass do not forge weld readily. Although it is possible to forge weld copper-based alloys, it is often with great difficulty due to copper's tendency to absorb oxygen during the heating.CDA Publication Issue 12 by the Copper Development Association  CDA 1951 Page 40 Copper and its alloys are usually better joined with cold welding, explosion welding, or other pressure-welding techniques. With iron or steel, the presence of even small amounts of copper severely reduces the alloy's ability to forge weld.Alloying: Understanding the Basics by Joseph R. Davis  ASM International 2001 Page 139Joining of Materials and Structures: From Pragmatic Process to Enabling by Robert W. Messler  Elsevier 2004 Page 333 Titanium alloys are commonly forge welded. Because of titanium's tendency to absorb oxygen when molten, the solid-state, diffusion bond of a forge weld is often stronger than a fusion weld in which the metal is liquefied.Titanium: A Technical Guide, second edition by Matthew J. Donachie  ASM International 2000 Page 76 Forge welding between similar materials is caused by solid-state diffusion. This results in a weld that consists of only the welded materials without any fillers or bridging materials. Forge welding between dissimilar materials is caused by the formation of a lower melting temperature eutectic between the materials. Due to this the weld is often stronger than the individual metals. Processes A mechanized trip hammer. The most well-known and oldest forge-welding process is the manual-hammering method. Manual hammering is done by heating the metal to the proper temperature, coating with flux, overlapping the weld surfaces, and then striking the joint repeatedly with a hand-held hammer. The joint is often formed to allow space for the flux to flow out, by beveling or rounding the surfaces slightly, and hammered in a successively outward fashion to squeeze the flux out. The hammer blows are typically not as hard as those used for shaping, preventing the flux from being blasted out of the joint at the first blow. When mechanical hammers were developed, forge welding could be accomplished by heating the metal, and then placing it between the mechanized hammer and the anvil. Originally powered by waterwheels, modern mechanical-hammers can also be operated by compressed air, electricity, steam, gas engines, and many other ways. Another method is forge welding with a die, whereas the pieces of metal are heated and then forced into a die which both provides the pressure for the weld and keeps the joint at the finished shape. Roll welding is another forge welding process, where the heated metals are overlapped and passed through rollers at high pressures to create the weld.Metal Casting and Joining by K. C. John  PHI Learning 2015 Page 392New Edge of the Anvil: A Resource Book for the Blacksmith by Jack Andrews Shipjack Press 1994 Page 9396 Modern forge-welding is often automated, using computers, machines, and sophisticated hydraulic-presses to produce a variety of products from a number of various alloys.Joining: Understanding the Basics by Flake C. Campbell ASM International 2011 Page 144 145 For example, steel pipe is often forge-welded during the manufacturing process. Flat stock is heated and fed through specially-shaped rollers that both form the steel into a tube and simultaneously provide the pressure to weld the edges into a continuous seam.Welding Fabrication & Repair: Questions and Answers by Frank M. Marlow  Industrial press 2002 Page 43 Diffusion bonding is a common method for forge welding titanium alloys in the aerospace industry. In this process the metal is heated while in a press or die. Beyond a specific critical-temperature, which varies depending on the alloy, the impurities burn out and the surfaces are forced together.Titanium: A Technical Guide, second edition by Matthew J. Donachie  ASM International 2000 Page 76 Other methods include flash welding and percussion welding. These are resistance forge-welding techniques where the press or die is electrified, passing high current through the alloy to create the heat for the weld.Titanium: A Technical Guide, second edition by Matthew J. Donachie  ASM International 2000 Page 76 Shielded active-gas forge-welding is a process of forge welding in an oxygen-reactive environment, to burn out oxides, using hydrogen gas and induction heating.Subsea Pipeline Engineering by Andrew Clennel Palmer, Roger A. King  PennWell 2008 Page 158 Temperature The temperature required to forge weld is typically 50 to 90 percent of the melting temperature.Titanium: A Technical Guide, second edition by Matthew J. Donachie  ASM International 2000 Page 76 Iron can be welded when it surpasses the critical temperature (the A4 temperature) where its allotrope changes from gamma iron (face-centered cubic) to delta iron (body-centered cubic). Since the critical temperatures are affected by alloying agents like carbon, steel welds at a lower temperature-range than iron. As the carbon content in the steel increases, the welding temperature-range decreases in a linear fashion.New Edge of the Anvil: A Resource Book for the Blacksmith by Jack Andrews Shipjack Press 1994 Page 9396 Iron, different steels, and even cast-iron can be welded to each other, provided that their carbon content is close enough that the welding ranges overlap. Pure iron can be welded when nearly white hot; between and . Steel with a carbon content of 2.0% can be welded when orangish-yellow, between and . Common steel, between 0.2 and 0.8% carbon, is typically welded at a bright yellow heat.New Edge of the Anvil: A Resource Book for the Blacksmith by Jack Andrews Shipjack Press 1994 Page 93 96 A primary requirement for forge welding is that both weld surfaces need to be heated to the same temperature and welded before they cool too much. When steel reaches the proper temperature, it begins to weld very readily, so a thin rod or nail heated to the same temperature will tend to stick at first contact, requiring it to be bent or twisted loose. One of the simplest ways to tell if iron or steel is hot enough is to stick a magnet to it. When iron crosses the A2 critical temperature, it begins to change into the allotrope called gamma iron. When this happens, the steel or iron becomes non- magnetic.New Edge of the Anvil: A Resource Book for the Blacksmith by Jack Andrews Shipjack Press 1994 Page 9396 In steel, the carbon begins to mix with gamma iron at the A3 temperature, forming a solid solution called austenite. When it crosses the A4 critical temperature, it changes into delta iron, which is magnetic. Therefore, a blacksmith can tell when the welding temperature is reached by placing a magnet in contact with the metal. When red or orange-hot, a magnet will not stick to the metal, but when the welding temperature is crossed, the magnet will again stick to it. The steel may take on a glossy or wet appearance at the welding temperature. Care must be taken to avoid overheating the metal to the point that it gives off sparks from rapid oxidation (burning), or else the weld will be poor and brittle.New Edge of the Anvil: A Resource Book for the Blacksmith by Jack Andrews Shipjack Press 1994 Page 9396 Decarburization When steel is heated to an austenizing temperature, the carbon begins to diffuse through the iron. The higher the temperature; the greater the rate of diffusion. At such high temperatures, carbon readily combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, so the carbon can easily diffuse out of the steel and into the surrounding air. By the end of a blacksmithing job, the steel will be of a lower carbon content than it was prior to heating. Therefore, most blacksmithing operations are done as quickly as possible to reduce decarburization, preventing the steel from becoming too soft. To produce the right amount of hardness in the finished product, the smith generally begins with steel that has a carbon content that is higher than desired. In ancient times, forging often began with steel that had a carbon content much too high for normal use. Most ancient forge-welding began with hypereutectoid steel, containing a carbon content sometimes well above 1.0%. Hypereutectoid steels are typically too brittle to be useful in a finished product, but by the end of forging the steel typically had a high carbon-content ranging from 0.8% (eutectoid tool- steel) to 0.5% (hypoeutectoid spring-steel).The History of Hardening by Hans Berns  Harterei Gerster AG 2013 Page 4849 Applications Forge welding has been used throughout its history for making most any items out of steel and iron. It has been used in everything from the manufacture of tools, farming implements, and cookware to the manufacture of fences, gates, and prison cells. In the early Industrial Revolution, it was commonly used in the manufacture of boilers and pressure vessels, until the introduction of fusion- welding. It was commonly used through the Middle Ages for producing armor and weapons. One of the most famous applications of forge welding involves the production of pattern-welded blades. During this process a smith repeatedly draws out a billet of steel, folds it back and welds it upon itself. Another application was the manufacture of shotgun barrels. Metal wire was spooled onto a mandrel, and then forged into a barrel that was thin, uniform, and strong. In some cases the forge-welded objects are acid-etched to expose the underlying pattern of metal, which is unique to each item and provides aesthetic appeal. Despite its diversity, forge welding had many limitations. A primary limitation was the size of objects that could be forge welded. Larger objects required a bigger heat source, and size reduced the ability to manually weld it together before it cooled too much. Welding large items like steel plate or girders was typically not possible, or at least highly impractical, until the invention of fusion welding, requiring them to be riveted instead. In some cases, fusion welding produced a much stronger weld, such as in the construction of boilers. Flux Forge welding requires the weld surfaces to be extremely clean or the metal will not join properly, if at all. Oxides tend to form on the surface while impurities like phosphorus and sulfur tend to migrate to the surface. Often a flux is used to keep the welding surfaces from oxidizing, which would produce a poor quality weld, and to extract other impurities from the metal. The flux mixes with the oxides that form and lowers the melting temperature and the viscosity of the oxides. This enables the oxides to flow out of the joint when the two pieces are beaten together. A simple flux can be made from borax, sometimes with the addition of powdered iron-filings.Bladesmithing with Murray Carter: Modern Application of Traditional Techniques by Murray Carter  F+W Media 2011 Page 40 The oldest flux used for forge welding was fine silica sand. The iron or steel would be heated in a reducing environment within the coals of the forge. Devoid of oxygen, the metal forms a layer of iron-oxide called wustite on its surface. When the metal is hot enough, but below the welding temperature, the smith sprinkles some sand onto the metal. The silicon in the sand reacts with the wustite to form fayalite, which melts just below the welding temperature. This produced a very effective flux which helped to make a strong weld.Iron and Steel in Ancient Times By Vagn Fabritius Buchwald  Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 Page 65 Early examples of flux used different combinations and various amounts of iron fillings, borax, sal ammoniac, balsam of copaiba, cyanide of potash, and soda phosphate. The 1920 edition of Scientific American book of facts and formulae indicates a frequently offered trade secret as using copperas, saltpeter, common salt, black oxide of manganese, prussiate of potash, and \\"nice welding sand\\" (silicate).

It is owned by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and is operated under a five-year lease as a partnership with Darby Development, LLC. Monmouth Park's marquee event is the Haskell Invitational, named after Amory L. Haskell. The Haskell was first run in 1968 as a handicap, but was made into an Invitational Handicap in 1981. It is now a 1‚Öõ-mile test for three-year-olds run in late July. Monmouth Park also now showcases the Jersey Derby originally run at Garden State Park until its closure in 2001. The racetrack's season spans from early May to Labor Day in early September. History=Long Branch Racetrack= The racetrack and part of the stands during the 2007 Breeders' Cup Three different buildings have been called Monmouth Park throughout the years. The original thoroughbred racing track was opened by the Monmouth Park Association on July 30, 1870 in Eatontown, New Jersey to increase summer tourism for communities along the Jersey Shore. Monmouth Park early on earned the nickname as the \\"Newmarket of America\\" due to the excellence of its racing. However, after three years of being open financial issues caused the track to close. In 1878, the track was bought by David D. Withers, George L. Lorillard, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., and George P. Wetmore. The men spent four years renovating the grounds and grandstand and reopened Monmouth Park in 1882. From 1882 to 1890, the track increased in popularity and as a result, a new racetrack was constructed next to the original. The new racetrack opened in 1890 becoming the second Monmouth Park. However, legislation proposed in 1891 and enacted in 1894 barred parimutuel betting in New Jersey, and the track closed its doors. In May 1894, the Township Committee at Eatontown, New Jersey ordered the seizure and sale of the Monmouth Park Association's grandstand and other property for the payment of back taxes and on May 7 was sold at a public auction. Some of the major races held at the Long Branch track included the Champion Stakes, the Freehold Stakes, and the Monmouth Cup. The United States Department of the Army later constructed Fort Monmouth on the site of the former racetrack. =Monmouth Park Jockey Club= In 1946, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill providing for state regulation of horse racing. The bill was championed by Amory L. Haskell, who led the legislative charge to once again permit wagering on horse racing in New Jersey and Philip H. Iselin, a New York City textile magnate. They also had the backing of Reeve Schley, Joseph M. Roebling, John M. MacDonald, Townsend B. Martin, and James Cox Brady, Jr.. The current Monmouth Park, now called the Monmouth Park Jockey Club, opened on June 19, 1946. Thoroughbred racing was back at the facility after a 53-year hiatus with 18,724 in attendance. =Monmouth Park Racetrack= The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority purchased Monmouth Park from its previous owners, the Monmouth Park Jockey Club, in 1985, in a deal valued at $45 million. The NJSEA still retains the corporate name \\"Monmouth Park Jockey Club\\". The Vans Warped Tour, a touring music and extreme sports festival, was successfully held at the racetrack in 2010 and 2011. It marks the New York stop on the nationwide tour, which visits the area during July. In 2012, the festival moved to the PNC Bank Arts Center in nearby Holmdel, New Jersey due to financial considerations. In 2011, a five-year lease was signed with Morris Bailey, co-owner of Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, to provide a marketing partnership between the casino and racetrack. The agreement allowed Resorts to sponsor the Haskell Invitational, and possibilities include a merging of loyalty programs as well as bringing entertainers' appearances at the casino to the racetrack. The program is part of a strategy to mesh horse racing with casino gambling. In April 2013, Monmouth Park opened the Bluegrass Miniature Golf Course near the Port-au-Peck Ave. entrance. The Course features two 18-hole courses, the Haskell Course and the Triple Crown Course. In July 2016, the luxury restaurant Blu Grotto, named after the Blue Grotto sea cave on the Italian island of Capri, opened at Monmouth Park. The restaurant is open year-round and is located near the racetrack's quarter-pole. The Beer Garden at Blu Grotto opened in 2017. On June 14, 2018, the Monmouth Park Sports Book by William Hill sportsbook opened and Monmouth Park became the first location in New Jersey to offer sports betting. Monmouth Park had pushed to legalize sports betting, which was legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association. Physical attributes The main track is a one-mile (1.6 km) dirt oval with chutes for 6 furlong and 1¬º mile races. The long infield chute at Monmouth Park leads to the main turf course and allows for races of up to 1‚Öõ miles. The turf course is seven furlongs in circumference, with a diagonal chute for races between and 1‚Öõ miles. A re-design of the grass course for the 2006 season brought with it a new, second chute to accommodate 5¬Ω furlong sprint races. Turf races can be run along the hedge, or with the portable rail out 12 feet (dubbed the \\"Haskell Course\\"), 24 feet (\\"Monmouth Course\\") or 36 feet (\\"Lennox Course\\"). The Stable Area, located directly to the north of the backstretch of the main track, contains a total of forty barns and stables, twelve north of the New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line (connected by its own service and access road) and twenty eight on the main complex. The Wolf Hill Farm, which served Monmouth Park as a private stable and practice facility, is located adjacent to and immediately west of the main complex. Wolf Hill, owned and operated by the Valentino Family from the nearby City of Long Branch, New Jersey featured barns, stables and a practice track featuring a dirt oval and turf course identical to that at Monmouth Park's main facility only built to 50% scale. The Valentino Family sold Wolf Hill Farm to the Monmouth Park Jockey Club in 1963 which then became part of the greater Monmouth Park Complex. It was transferred to state ownership in the 1986 takeover by the NJSEA and was eventually sold to the Monmouth County Park System in 1998 which now operates the site as Wolf Hill Recreation Area that features a 4-acre dog park, an 18-hole disc golf course, a baseball field and two softball fields. While Wolf Hill ceased operating as a farm following the 1963 sale, owners and trainers continued to use Wolf Hill's practice track well into the 1990s. Remnants of the practice were clearly visible on the site until after the 2009 meet. After the 2009 meet, construction began in the Wolf Hill area, eliminating the last of the practice track.

He suffered a dislocated fracture of his right front ankle and was euthanized on the track. =Million Dollar Meet= In March 2010, it was announced that Monmouth Park would shorten its summer meet, conducting only 50 days of live racing (down from 141 total thoroughbred days in the state) for a total of $50 million in purse money for the 2010 meet. This was done due to the recent monetary losses of the racetrack industry in New Jersey and made it the most expensive purse structure in North America at the time.

Accessibility & transportation The Park is served by the Monmouth Park station on New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line during the racing season. A special train called the \\"Pony Express\\" was discontinued after the 2005 racing season. This train operated between Hoboken Terminal and the racetrack, terminating on a rail siding near the grandstand entrance. It was often scouted out by railfans due to the variety of equipment that were used on the train in recent years, ranging from the 1970 vintage Pullman Standard Erie Lackawanna Comet I cars to modern Alstom Metro-North Comet Vs. Monmouth Park is also served by the 831 New Jersey Transit Bus route. The Park is accessible by car via NJ-36 with connections to the Garden State Parkway, I-195, New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) and other highways and roads. Parking is available in several on site lots.

It falls into the horror / humor genre. There were 24 issues in all and the series ran from Sept./Oct. 1973 to Nov./Dec. 1976. Background and creation According to Steve Skeates, Plop! was based around a horror / humor story he wrote called \\"The Poster Plague\\", which was published in House of Mystery. The title initially was intended to be called Zany. A number of the one-panel cartoons published in the comic included the visible prefix ZA, in reference to the originally intended title. Sergio Aragon√©s credits publisher Carmine Infantino with coming up with the final title: \\"Joe Orlando and I were sitting in a restaurant talking with Carmine Infantino. They wanted a magazine that was different, something about black humor. Carmine came up with the name. We were talking about it and he said, ‚ÄòWhat will we call it?‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòWe can call it anything, because if the magazine is good, then it will stay.‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòNo, we can‚Äôt call it, for instance ‚Ä¶ PLOP!‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòYes, we can.‚Äô And so I started making sketches of things going PLOP! and they laughed and decided the name was good.\\" Contents Each issue was centered on a frame story starring three ghoulish characters with biblical names: Cain, Abel (previously introduced in House of Mystery, and House of Secrets) and Eve. An issue would typically contain a story told by each of the characters, each bidding to outdo the others in fiendishness. Stories for Plop! were generally created in one of three ways. The most common was that Steve Skeates would write the stories himself, using the full script method. Due to a brief feud with editor Joe Orlando, for a time Skeates' stories were written under the pseudonym Chester P. Hazel. The second way was using plot ideas submitted by readers of the anthology. Orlando would select which plot ideas would be used, and Skeates would then write the full story. The third way was that Aragon√©s would write the plot, and someone else would write the script once the story was fully drawn. An illustrative tale drawn by Berni Wrightson involved a gourmet diner whose love for frog legs leads to a predictable amphibian revenge: he is left without lower limbs and is doomed to negotiate the world on a trolley. Basil Wolverton and Wallace Wood provided covers for the first 19 issues, each depicting a freakish character of some kind. The cover borders hosting a plethora of creatures, however, were drawn by Sergio Aragon√©s. All three artists worked on MAD, and the logo of Plop! is reminiscent of the early logo of that magazine. Wolverton's covers were not drawn for Plop!; they were inventory pieces which he sent to DC Comics as a general submission. When all of the drawings he submitted were found suitable for use in Plop!, Wolverton briefly came out of retirement so that he could continue drawing covers for the magazine. After he had a stroke, the magazine turned to Wood as the new cover artist. Aragon√©s drew most of the frame stories. Later MAD contributor Dave Manak also did art. The magazine was first published without ads, but when sales proved insufficient, advertisements were brought in for later issues. The magazine sold so poorly that even with the added advertising revenue, DC Comics lost money on each issue, leading to its cancellation. Awards The series received a number of awards including the Shazam Award for Best Humor Story in 1973 for \\"The Gourmet\\" in issue #1, and another nomination for the same award for \\"The Escape\\" in the same issue. Steve Skeates also won the Shazam Award for Best Writer (Humor Division) in 1973 for his work on the series. The comic won the Eagle Award for Favourite Comic (Humour) in 1977.

Letter case (or just case) is the distinction between the letters that are in larger upper case or capitals (or more formally majuscule) and smaller lower case (or more formally minuscule) in the written representation of certain languages. The writing systems that distinguish between the upper and lower case have two parallel sets of letters, with each letter in one set usually having an equivalent in the other set. The two case variants are alternative representations of the same letter: they have the same name and pronunciation and are treated identically when sorting in alphabetical order. Letter case is generally applied in a mixed- case fashion, with both upper- and lower-case letters appearing in a given piece of text for legibility. The choice of case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline. In orthography, the upper case is primarily reserved for special purposes, such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun (called capitalisation, or capitalised words), which makes the lower case the more common variant in regular text. In some contexts, it is conventional to use one case only. For example, engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper- case letters, which are easier to distinguish individually than the lower case when space restrictions require that the lettering be very small. In mathematics, on the other hand, letter case may indicate the relationship between objects, with upper-case letters often representing \\"superior\\" objects (e.g. X could be a set containing the generic member x).  Terminology  The terms upper case and lower case may be written as two consecutive words, connected with a hyphen (upper-case and lower-case particularly if they pre- modify another noun), or as a single word (uppercase and lowercase). These terms originated from the common layouts of the shallow drawers called type cases used to hold the movable type for letterpress printing. Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate shallow tray or \\"case\\" that was located above the case that held the small letters. Majuscule ( or ), for palaeographers, is technically any script in which the letters have very few or very short ascenders and descenders, or none at all (for example, the majuscule scripts used in the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209, or the Book of Kells). By virtue of their visual impact, this made the term majuscule an apt descriptor for what much later came to be more commonly referred to as uppercase letters. Minuscule refers to lower-case letters. The word is often spelled miniscule, by association with the unrelated word miniature and the prefix mini-. This has traditionally been regarded as a spelling mistake (since minuscule is derived from the word minus), but is now so common that some dictionaries tend to accept it as a nonstandard or variant spelling. Miniscule is still less likely, however, to be used in reference to lower-case letters.  Typographical considerations  The glyphs of lower-case letters can resemble smaller forms of the upper-case glyphs restricted to the base band (e.g. \\"C/c\\" and \\"S/s\\", cf. small caps) or can look hardly related (e.g. \\"D/d\\" and \\"G/g\\"). Here is a comparison of the upper and lower case variants of each letter included in the English alphabet (the exact representation will vary according to the typeface and font used): { style=\\"margin- left:1.5em;text-align:left;\\" - !style=\\"padding:0 1.0em;\\" Upper case  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z - !style=\\"padding:0 1.0em;\\" Lower case  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z } Typographically, the basic difference between the majuscules and minuscules is not that the majuscules are big and minuscules small, but that the majuscules generally have the same height (although, depending on the typeface, there may be some exceptions, particularly with Q and sometimes J having a descending element; also, various diacritics can add to the normal height of a letter). Ascenders (as in \\"h\\") and descenders (as in \\"p\\") make the height of lower-case letters vary. There is more variation in the height of the minuscules, as some of them have parts higher (ascenders) or lower (descenders) than the typical size. Normally, b, d, f, h, k, l, t are the letters with ascenders, and g, j, p, q, y are the ones with descenders. In addition, with old-style numerals still used by some traditional or classical fonts, 6 and 8 make up the ascender set, and 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 the descender set.  Bicameral script  Handwritten Cyrillic script Adyghe Latin alphabet, used between 1927 and 1938, was based on Latin script, but did not have capital letters, being unicameral Writing systems using two separate cases are bicameral scripts. Languages that use the Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Coptic, Armenian, Adlam, Warang Citi, Cherokee, Garay, and Osage scripts use letter cases in their written form as an aid to clarity and legibility. Another bicameral script, which is not used for any modern languages, is Deseret. The Georgian alphabet has several variants, and there were attempts to use them as different cases, but the modern written Georgian language does not distinguish case. Many other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules a system called unicameral script or unicase. This includes most syllabic and other non-alphabetic scripts. In scripts with a case distinction, lower case is generally used for the majority of text; capitals are used for capitalisation and emphasis when bold is not available. Acronyms (and particularly initialisms) are often written in all-caps, depending on various factors. =Capitalisation= Capitalisation is the writing of a word with its first letter in uppercase and the remaining letters in lowercase. Capitalisation rules vary by language and are often quite complex, but in most modern languages that have capitalisation, the first word of every sentence is capitalised, as are all proper nouns. Capitalisation in English, in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context (e.g. title vs. heading vs. text), is universally standardised for formal writing. Capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence, a proper noun, or a proper adjective. The names of the days of the week and the names of the months are also capitalised, as are the first- person pronoun \\"I\\" and the interjection \\"O\\" (although the latter is uncommon in modern usage, with \\"oh\\" being preferred). There are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose only difference is capitalisation of the first letter. Honorifics and personal titles showing rank or prestige are capitalised when used together with the name of the person (for example, \\"Mr. Smith\\", \\"Bishop O'Brien\\", \\"Professor Moore\\") or as a direct address, but normally not when used alone and in a more general sense. It can also be seen as customary to capitalise any word in some contexts even a pronoun referring to the deity of a monotheistic religion. Other words normally start with a lower-case letter. There are, however, situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis, for example in headings and publication titles (see below). In some traditional forms of poetry, capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a line of verse independent of any grammatical feature. Other languages vary in their use of capitals. For example, in German all nouns are capitalised (this was previously common in English as well, mainly in the 17th and 18th centuries), while in Romance and most other European languages the names of the days of the week, the names of the months, and adjectives of nationality, religion, and so on normally begin with a lower-case letter. On the other hand, in some languages it is customary to capitalise formal polite pronouns, for example De, Dem (Danish), Sie, Ihnen (German), and Vd or Ud (short for usted in Spanish). Informal communication, such as texting, instant messaging or a handwritten sticky note, may not bother to follow the conventions concerning capitalisation, but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal. =Exceptional letters and digraphs= * The German letter \\"√ü\\" formerly existed only in lower case. The orthographical capitalisation does not concern \\"√ü\\", which never occurs at the beginning of a word, and in the all-caps style it has traditionally been replaced by the digraph \\"SS\\". Since June 2017, however, capital ·∫û is accepted as an alternative in the all-caps style.Cf. . * The Greek upper-case letter \\"Œ£\\" has two different lower-case forms: \\"œÇ\\" in word-final position and \\"œÉ\\" elsewhere. In a similar manner, the Latin upper-case letter \\"S\\" used to have two different lower-case forms: \\"s\\" in word-final position and \\" ≈ø \\" elsewhere. The latter form, called the long s, fell out of general use before the middle of the 19th century, except for the countries that continued to use Blackletter typefaces such as Fraktur. When Blackletter type fell out of general use in the mid-20th century, even those countries dropped the long s. * There is a complicated treatment of the Greek Iota subscript. * Unlike most Latin-script languages, which link the dotless upper-case \\"I\\" with the dotted lower-case \\"i\\", Turkish has both a dotted and dotless I, each in both upper and lower case. Each of the two pairs (\\"ƒ∞/i\\" and \\"I/ƒ±\\") represents a distinctive phoneme. * In some languages, specific digraphs may be regarded as single letters, and in Dutch, the digraph \\"IJ/ij\\" is even capitalised with both components written in uppercase (for example, \\"IJsland\\" rather than \\"Ijsland\\"). In other languages, such as Welsh and Hungarian, various digraphs are regarded as single letters for collation purposes, but the second component of the digraph will still be written in lower case even if the first component is capitalised. Similarly, in South Slavic languages whose orthography is coordinated between the Cyrillic and Latin scripts, the Latin digraphs \\"«à/«â\\", \\"«ã/«å\\" and \\"«Ö/«Ü\\" are each regarded as a single letter (like their Cyrillic equivalents \\"–â/—ô\\", \\"–ä/—ö\\" and \\"–è/—ü\\", respectively), but only in all-caps style should both components be in upper case (e.g. «ài«âan‚Äì«áI«áAN, «ão«åa‚Äì«äO«äA, «Öi«Üa‚Äì«ÑI«ÑA). Unicode designates a single character for each case variant (i.e., upper case, title case and lower case) of the three digraphs. * In the Hawaiian orthography, the okina is a phonemic symbol that visually resembles a left single quotation mark. Representing the glottal stop, the okina can either be characterized as a letter or a diacritic. As a unicase letter, the okina is unaffected by capitalisation; it is the following letter that is capitalised instead. According to the Unicode standard, the okina is formally encoded as , but it is not uncommon to substitute this with a similar punctuation character, such as the left single quotation mark or an apostrophe. = Related phenomena = Similar orthographic and graphostylistic conventions are used for emphasis or following language-specific or other rules, including: * Font effects such as italic type or oblique type, boldface, and choice of serif vs. sans-serif. * Typographical conventions in mathematical formulae include the use of Greek letters and the use of Latin letters with special formatting such as blackboard bold and blackletter. * Some letters of the Arabic and Hebrew alphabets and some jamo of the Korean hangul have different forms depending on placement within a word, but these rules are strict and the different forms cannot be used for emphasis. In the Arabic and Arabic-based alphabets, letters in a word are connected, except for several that cannot connect to the following letter. Letters may have distinct forms depending on whether they are initial (connected only to the following letter), medial (connected to both neighboring letters), final (connected only to the preceding letter), or isolated (connected to neither a preceding nor a following letter). In the Hebrew alphabet, five letters have a distinct form (see Final form) that is used when they are word-final. * In Georgian, some authors use isolated letters from the ancient Asomtavruli alphabet within a text otherwise written in the modern Mkhedruli in a fashion that is reminiscent of the usage of upper-case letters in the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets. * In the Japanese writing system, an author has the option of switching between kanji, hiragana, katakana, and r≈çmaji. In particular, every hiragana character has an equivalent katakana character, and vice versa. Romanised Japanese sometimes uses lowercase letters to represent words that would be written in hiragana, and uppercase letters to represent words that would be written in katakana. Some kana characters are written in smaller type when they modify or combine with the preceding sign (y≈çon) or the following sign (sokuon). Stylistic or specialised usage=Case styles= New York Times report published in November 1919. (The event reported is Arthur Eddington's test of Einstein's theory of general relativity.) In English, a variety of case styles are used in various circumstances: ; Sentence case : \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\" A mixed-case style in which the first word of the sentence is capitalised, as well as proper nouns and other words as required by a more specific rule. This is generally equivalent to the baseline universal standard of formal English orthography. : In computer programming, the initial capital is more easy to automate than the other rules. For example, on English-language Wikipedia, the first character in page titles is capitalised by default. Because the other rules are more complex, substrings for concatenation into sentences are commonly written in ‚Äúmid-sentence case‚Äù, applying all the rules of sentence case except the initial capital. ; Title case (capital case, headline style) : \\"The Quick Brown Fox Jumps over the Lazy Dog\\" A mixed-case style with all words capitalised, except for certain subsets (particularly articles and short prepositions and conjunctions) defined by rules that are not universally standardised. The standardisation is only at the level of house styles and individual style manuals. In text processing, title case usually involves the capitalisation of all words irrespective of their part of speech. This simplified variant of title case is also known as start case or initial caps. ; All caps (all uppercase) : \\"THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG\\" A unicase style with capital letters only. This can be used in headings and special situations, such as for typographical emphasis in text made on a typewriter. With the advent of the Internet, the all-caps style is more often used for emphasis; however, it is considered poor netiquette by some to type in all capitals, and said to be tantamount to shouting.RFC 1855 \\"Netiquette Guidelines\\" Long spans of Latin-alphabet text in all upper-case are more difficult to read because of the absence of the ascenders and descenders found in lower-case letters, which aids recognition and legibility. In some cultures it is common to write family names in all caps to distinguish them from the given names, especially in identity documents such as passports. ; Small caps : \\"\\" Similar in form to capital letters but roughly the size of a lower-case \\"x\\", small caps can be used instead of lower-case letters and combined with regular caps in a mixed-case fashion. This is a feature of certain fonts such as Copperplate Gothic. According to various typographical traditions, the height of small caps can be equal to or slightly larger than the x-height of the typeface (the smaller variant is sometimes called petite caps and may also be mixed with the larger variant). Small caps can be used for acronyms, names, mathematical entities, computer commands in printed text, business or personal printed stationery letterheads, and other situations where a given phrase needs to be distinguished from the main text. ; All lowercase :\\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\" Steve Jobs's signature as seen on the inner side of the original Macintosh, using lower case cursive :A unicase style with no capital letters. This is sometimes used for artistic effect, such as in poetry. Also commonly seen in computer languages, and in informal electronic communications such as SMS language and instant messaging (avoiding the shift key, to type more quickly). Apple co-founder Steve Jobs used all-lowercase (in cursive) in his signature. { style=\\"margin:0 auto 1.5em;font-size:95%;background:white;text- align:center;\\" + style=\\"text-align:left;font-size:110%;font-weight:bold;\\" A comparison of various case styles (from most to least capitals used) - style=\\"text-align:left;border-bottom:1px solid #aaa;\\"  Case style colspan=\\"8\\" Example style=\\"padding-left:1.0em;\\" Description - style=\\"background:#d0d0d0;\\" style=\\"background:white;text-align:left;\\" All- caps  THE  VITAMINS  ARE  IN  MY  FRESH  CALIFORNIA  RAISINS style=\\"background:white;padding-left:1.0em;text-align:left;\\" All letters uppercase - style=\\"background:#e0e0e0;\\" style=\\"background:white;text-align:left;\\" Start case  The  Vitamins  Are  In  My  Fresh  California  Raisins style=\\"background:white;padding-left:1.0em;text-align:left;\\" All words capitalised regardless of function - style=\\"background:#e0e0e0;\\" style=\\"background:white;text-align:left;\\" Title case  The  Vitamins  Are style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" in  My  Fresh  California  Raisins style=\\"background:white;padding-left:1.0em;text-align:left;\\" The first word and all other words capitalised except for articles and short prepositions and conjunctions - style=\\"background:#e0e0e0;\\" style=\\"background:white;text- align:left;padding-right:1.0em;\\" German-style sentence case  The  Vitamins style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" are style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" in style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" my style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" fresh  California  Raisins style=\\"background:white;padding-left:1.0em;text- align:left;\\" The first word and all nouns capitalised - style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" style=\\"background:white;text-align:left;\\" Sentence case style=\\"background:#e0e0e0;\\" The  vitamins  are  in  my  fresh style=\\"background:#e0e0e0;\\" California  raisins style=\\"background:white;padding-left:1.0em;text-align:left;\\" The first word, proper nouns and some specified words capitalised - style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" style=\\"background:white;text-align:left;\\" Mid- sentence case  the  vitamins  are  in  my  fresh style=\\"background:#e0e0e0;\\" California  raisins style=\\"background:white;padding-left:1.0em;text-align:left;\\" As above but excepting special treatment of the first word - style=\\"background:#f0f0f0;\\" style=\\"background:white;text-align:left;\\" All-lowercase  the  vitamins  are  in  my  fresh  raisins style=\\"background:white;padding- left:1.0em;text-align:left;\\" All letters lowercase (unconventional in English) } Headings and publication titles In English-language publications, various conventions are used for the capitalisation of words in publication titles and headlines, including chapter and section headings. The rules differ substantially between individual house styles. The convention followed by many British publishers (including scientific publishers, like Nature, magazines, like The Economist and New Scientist, and newspapers, like The Guardian and The Times) and also U.S. newspapers, is sentence-style capitalisation in headlines, i.e. capitalisation follows the same rules that apply for sentences. This convention is usually called sentence case. It may also be applied to publication titles, especially in bibliographic references and library catalogues. An example of a global publisher whose English- language house style prescribes sentence-case titles and headings is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). For publication titles it is, however, a common typographic practice among both British and U.S. publishers to capitalise significant words (and in the United States, this is often applied to headings, too). This family of typographic conventions is usually called title case. For example, R. M. Ritter's Oxford Manual of Style (2002) suggests capitalising \\"the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs, but generally not articles, conjunctions and short prepositions\\". This is an old form of emphasis, similar to the more modern practice of using a larger or boldface font for titles. The rules which prescribe which words to capitalise are not based on any grammatically inherent correct-incorrect distinction and are not universally standardised; they differ between style guides, although most style guides tend to follow a few strong conventions, as follows: * Most styles capitalise all words except for short closed-class words (certain parts of speech, namely, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions); but the first word (always) and last word (in many styles) are also capitalised, regardless of their part of speech. Many styles capitalise longer prepositions such as \\"between\\" and \\"throughout\\", but not shorter ones such as \\"for\\" and \\"with\\". Typically, a preposition is considered short if it has up to three or four letters. * A few styles capitalise all words in title case (the so-called start case), which has the advantage of being easy to implement and hard to get \\"wrong\\" (that is, \\"not edited to style\\"). Because of this rule's simplicity, software case-folding routines can handle 95% or more of the editing, especially if they are programmed for desired exceptions (such as \\"FBI\\" rather than \\"Fbi\\"). * As for whether hyphenated words are capitalised not only at the beginning but also after the hyphen, there is no universal standard; variation occurs in the wild and among house styles (e.g., \\"The Letter-Case Rule in My Book\\"; \\"Short-term Follow-up Care for Burns\\"). Traditional copyediting makes a distinction between temporary compounds (such as many nonce [novel instance] compound modifiers), in which every part of the hyphenated word is capitalised (e.g. \\"How This Particular Author Chose to Style His Autumn-Apple-Picking Heading\\"), and permanent compounds, which are terms that, although compound and hyphenated, are so well established that dictionaries enter them as headwords (e.g., \\"Short-term Follow-up Care for Burns\\"). Title case is widely used in many English-language publications, especially in the United States. However, its conventions are sometimes not followed strictly especially in informal writing. In creative typography, such as music record covers and other artistic material, all styles are commonly encountered, including all- lowercase letters and special case styles, such as studly caps (see below). For example, in the wordmarks of video games it is not uncommon to use stylised upper-case letters at the beginning and end of a title, with the intermediate letters in small caps or lower case (e.g., , , and DmC). Multi-word proper nouns Single-word proper nouns are capitalised in formal written English, unless the name is intentionally stylised to break this rule (such as the first or last name of danah boyd). Multi-word proper nouns include names of organisations, publications, and people. Often the rules for \\"title case\\" (described in the previous section) are applied to these names, so that non-initial articles, conjunctions, and short prepositions are lowercase, and all other words are uppercase. For example, the short preposition \\"of\\" and the article \\"the\\" are lowercase in \\"Steering Committee of the Finance Department\\". Usually only capitalised words are used to form an acronym variant of the name, though there is some variation in this. With personal names, this practice can vary (sometimes all words are capitalised, regardless of length or function), but is not limited to English names. Examples include the English names Tamar of Georgia and Catherine the Great, \\"van\\" and \\"der\\" in Dutch names, \\"von\\" and \\"zu\\" in German, \\"de\\", \\"los\\", and \\"y\\" in Spanish names, \\"de\\" or \\"d'\\" in French names, and \\"ibn\\" in Arabic names. Some surname prefixes also affect the capitalisation of the following internal letter or word, for example \\"Mac\\" in Celtic names and \\"Al\\" in Arabic names. Special case styles Some case styles are not used in standard English, but are common in computer programming, product branding, or other specialised fields: ; Camel case :\\"theQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog\\" or \\"TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog\\" Spaces and punctuation are removed and the first letter of each word is capitalised. If this includes the first letter of the first word (\\"CamelCase\\", \\"PowerPoint\\", \\"TheQuick...\\", etc.), the case is sometimes called upper camel case (or, illustratively, CamelCase), Pascal case, or bumpy case. When the first letter of the first word is lowercase (\\"iPod\\", \\"eBay\\", \\"theQuickBrownFox...\\"), the case is usually known as lower camel case or dromedary case (illustratively: dromedaryCase). This format has become popular in the branding of information technology products and services. ; Snake case :\\"the_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog\\" Punctuation is removed and spaces are replaced by single underscores. Normally the letters share the same case (e.g. \\"UPPER_CASE_EMBEDDED_UNDERSCORE\\" or \\"lower_case_embedded_underscore\\") but the case can be mixed, as in OCaml modules. The style may also be called pothole case, especially in Python programming, in which this convention is often used for naming variables. Illustratively, it may be rendered snake_case, pothole_case, etc. When all- upper-case, it may be referred to as screaming snake case (or SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). ; Kebab case :\\"the-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-lazy- dog\\" Similar to snake case, above, except hyphens rather than underscores are used to replace spaces. It is also known as spinal case, param case, Lisp case, and dash case (or illustratively as kebab-case). If every word is capitalised, the style is known as train case (TRAIN-CASE). ; Studly caps : e.g. \\"tHeqUicKBrOWnFoXJUmpsoVeRThElAzydOG\\" Mixed case with no semantic or syntactic significance to the use of the capitals. Sometimes only vowels are upper case, at other times upper and lower case are alternated, but often it is simply random. The name comes from the sarcastic or ironic implication that it was used in an attempt by the writer to convey their own coolness. It is also used to mock the violation of standard English case conventions by marketers in the naming of computer software packages, even when there is no technical requirement to do soe.g., Sun Microsystems' naming of a windowing system NeWS. Illustrative naming of the style is, naturally, random: stUdlY cAps, StUdLy CaPs, etc. =Unit symbols in the metric system= SI base-unit symbols, \\"A\\" (ampere for electric current) and \\"K\\" (kelvin for temperature), both named after people, are always written in upper case, whereas \\"s\\" (second for time), \\"m\\" (metre for length), \\"kg\\" (kilogram for mass), \\"cd\\" (candela for luminous intensity), and \\"mol\\" (mole for amount of substance) are written in lower case. In the International System of Units (SI), a letter usually has different meanings in upper and lower case when used as a unit symbol. Generally, unit symbols are written in lower case, but if the name of the unit is derived from a proper noun, the first letter of the symbol is capitalised (nevertheless, the name of the unit, if spelled out, is always considered a common noun and written accordingly): * 1 s (one second) when used for the base unit of time. * 1 S (one siemens) when used for the unit of electric conductance and admittance (named after Werner von Siemens). * 1 Sv (one sievert), used for the unit of ionising radiation dose (named after Rolf Maximilian Sievert). For the purpose of clarity, the symbol for litre can optionally be written in upper case even though the name is not derived from a proper noun: * 1 l, the original form, for typefaces in which \\"digit one\\" , \\"lower-case ell\\" , and \\"upper-case eye\\" look different. * 1 L, an alternative form, for typefaces in which these characters are difficult to distinguish, or the typeface the reader will be using is unknown. A \\"script l\\" in various typefaces (e.g.: 1 l) has traditionally been used in some countries to prevent confusion; however, the separate Unicode character which represents this, , is deprecated by the SI. Another solution sometimes seen in Web typography is to use a serif font for \\"lower-case ell\\" in otherwise sans-serif material (1 l). The letter case of a prefix symbol is determined independently of the unit symbol to which it is attached. Lower case is used for all submultiple prefix symbols and the small multiple prefix symbols up to \\"k\\" (for kilo, meaning 103 = 1000 multiplier), whereas upper case is used for larger multipliers: * 1 ms, a small measure of time (\\"m\\" for milli, meaning 10‚àí3 = 1/1000 multiplier). * 1 Ms, a large measure of time (\\"M\\" for mega, meaning 106 = 1 000 000 multiplier). * 1 mS, a small measure (in millisiemens) of electric conductance. * 1 MS, a large measure (megasiemens) of electric conductance. * 1 mm, a small measure of length (the latter \\"m\\" for metre). * 1 Mm, a large measure of length. Case folding and case conversion In the character sets developed for computing, each upper- and lower-case letter is encoded as a separate character. In order to enable case folding and case conversion, the software needs to link together the two characters representing the case variants of a letter. (Some old character-encoding systems, such as the Baudot code, are restricted to one set of letters, usually represented by the upper-case variants.) Case- insensitive operations can be said to fold case, from the idea of folding the character code table so that upper- and lower-case letters coincide. The conversion of letter case in a string is common practice in computer applications, for instance to make case-insensitive comparisons. Many high- level programming languages provide simple methods for case conversion, at least for the ASCII character set. Whether or not the case variants are treated as equivalent to each other varies depending on the computer system and context. For example, user passwords are generally case sensitive in order to allow more diversity and make them more difficult to break. On the other hand, when performing a keyword search, differentiating between the upper and lower case might narrow down the search result too much. =Unicode case folding and script identification= Unicode defines case folding through the three case-mapping properties of each character: upper case, lower case, and title case (in this context, \\"title case\\" relates to ligatures and digraphs encoded as mixed-case single characters, in which the first component is in upper case and the second component in lower case). These properties relate all characters in scripts with differing cases to the other case variants of the character. As briefly discussed in Unicode Technical Note #26, \\"In terms of implementation issues, any attempt at a unification of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic would wreak havoc [and] make casing operations an unholy mess, in effect making all casing operations context sensitive [‚Ä¶]\\". In other words, while the shapes of letters like A, B, E, H, K, M, O, P, T, X, Y and so on are shared between the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets (and small differences in their canonical forms may be considered to be of a merely typographical nature), it would still be problematic for a multilingual character set or a font to provide only a single code point for, say, uppercase letter B, as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower-case letter, the Latin b (U+0062), Greek Œ≤ (U+03B2) or Cyrillic –≤ (U+0432). Therefore, the corresponding Latin, Greek and Cyrillic upper-case letters (U+0042, U+0392 and U+0412, respectively) are also encoded as separate characters, despite their appearance being basically identical. Without letter case, a \\"unified European alphabet\\"such as AB–ëC–ìDŒîŒï–Ñ–óFŒ¶GHI–òJ...Z, with an appropriate subset for each languageis feasible; but considering letter case, it becomes very clear that these alphabets are rather distinct sets of symbols. =Methods in word processing= Most modern word processors provide automated case conversion with a simple click or keystroke. For example, in Microsoft Office Word, there is a dialog box for toggling the selected text through UPPERCASE, then lowercase, then Title Case (actually start caps; exception words must be lowercased individually). The keystroke does the same thing. =Methods in programming= In some forms of BASIC there are two methods for case conversion: UpperA$ = UCASE$(\\"a\\") LowerA$ = LCASE$(\\"A\\") C and C++, as well as any C-like language that conforms to its standard library, provide these functions in the file ctype.h: char upperA = toupper('a'); char lowerA = tolower('A'); Case conversion is different with different character sets. In ASCII or EBCDIC, case can be converted in the following way, in C: #define toupper(c) (islower(c) ? (c) ‚Äì 'a' + 'A' : (c)) #define tolower(c) (isupper(c) ? (c) ‚Äì 'A' + 'a' : (c)) This only works because the letters of upper and lower cases are spaced out equally. In ASCII they are consecutive, whereas with EBCDIC they are not; nonetheless the upper-case letters are arranged in the same pattern and with the same gaps as are the lower-case letters, so the technique still works. Some computer programming languages offer facilities for converting text to a form in which all words are capitalised. Visual Basic calls this \\"proper case\\"; Python calls it \\"title case\\". This differs from usual title casing conventions, such as the English convention in which minor words are not capitalised. History Originally alphabets were written entirely in majuscule letters, spaced between well- defined upper and lower bounds. When written quickly with a pen, these tended to turn into rounder and much simpler forms. It is from these that the first minuscule hands developed, the half-uncials and cursive minuscule, which no longer stayed bound between a pair of lines. These in turn formed the foundations for the Carolingian minuscule script, developed by Alcuin for use in the court of Charlemagne, which quickly spread across Europe. The advantage of the minuscule over majuscule was improved, faster readability. In Latin, papyri from Herculaneum dating before 79 CE (when it was destroyed) have been found that have been written in old Roman cursive, where the early forms of minuscule letters \\"d\\", \\"h\\" and \\"r\\", for example, can already be recognised. According to papyrologist Knut Kleve, \\"The theory, then, that the lower-case letters have been developed from the fifth century uncials and the ninth century Carolingian minuscules seems to be wrong.\\" Both majuscule and minuscule letters existed, but the difference between the two variants was initially stylistic rather than orthographic and the writing system was still basically unicameral: a given handwritten document could use either one style or the other but these were not mixed. European languages, except for Ancient Greek and Latin, did not make the case distinction before about 1300. The timeline of writing in Western Europe can be divided into four eras: *Greek majuscule (9th‚Äì3rd century BCE) in contrast to the Greek uncial script (3rd century BCE ‚Äì 12th century CE) and the later Greek minuscule *Roman majuscule (7th century BCE ‚Äì 4th century CE) in contrast to the Roman uncial (4th‚Äì8th century CE), Roman Half Uncial, and minuscule *Carolingian majuscule (4th‚Äì8th century CE) in contrast to the Carolingian minuscule (around 780 ‚Äì 12th century) *Gothic majuscule (13th and 14th century), in contrast to the early Gothic (end of 11th to 13th century), Gothic (14th century), and late Gothic (16th century) minuscules. Traditionally, certain letters were rendered differently according to a set of rules. In particular, those letters that began sentences or nouns were made larger and often written in a distinct script. There was no fixed capitalisation system until the early 18th century. The English language eventually dropped the rule for nouns, while the German language keeps it. Similar developments have taken place in other alphabets. The lower-case script for the Greek alphabet has its origins in the 7th century and acquired its quadrilinear form (that is, characterized by ascenders and descenders) in the 8th century. Over time, uncial letter forms were increasingly mixed into the script. The earliest dated Greek lower-case text is the Uspenski Gospels (MS 461) in the year 835.The earliest known biblical manuscript is a palimpsest of Isajah in Syriac, written in 459/460. Bruce M. Metzger & Bart D. Ehrman, The Text of the New Testament (Oxford University Press: 2005), p. 92. The modern practice of capitalising the first letter of every sentence seems to be imported (and is rarely used when printing Ancient Greek materials even today). thumbcenter700px Simplified relationship between various scripts leading to the development of modern lower case of standard Latin alphabet and that of the modern variants Fraktur (used in Germany until 1940s) and Gaelic (used in Ireland). Several scripts coexisted such as half-uncial and uncial, which derive from Roman cursive and Greek uncial, and Visigothic, Merovingian (Luxeuil variant here) and Beneventan. The Carolingian script was the basis for blackletter and humanist minuscule. What is commonly called \\"Gothic writing\\" is technically called blackletter (here textualis quadrata) and is completely unrelated to Visigothic script. The letter j is i with a flourish, u and v are the same letter in early scripts and were used depending on their position in insular half-uncial and caroline minuscule and later scripts, w is a ligature of vv, in insular the rune wynn is used as a w (three other runes in use were the thorn (√æ),  ªf√© º (·ö†) as an abbreviation for cattle/goods and ma√∞r (·õò) for man). The letters y and z were very rarely used, in particular √æ was written identically to y so y was dotted to avoid confusion, the dot was adopted for i only after late-caroline (protogothic), in beneventan script the macron abbreviation featured a dot above. Lost variants such as r rotunda, ligatures and scribal abbreviation marks are omitted; long s is shown when no terminal s (the only variant used today) is preserved from a given script. Humanist script was the basis for Venetian types which changed little until today, such as Times New Roman (a serifed typeface). =Type cases= The individual type blocks used in hand typesetting are stored in shallow wooden or metal drawers known as \\"type cases\\". Each is subdivided into a number of compartments (\\"boxes\\") for the storage of different individual letters. The Oxford Universal Dictionary on Historical Advanced Proportional Principles (reprinted 1952) indicates that case in this sense (referring to the box or frame used by a compositor in the printing trade) was first used in English in 1588. Originally one large case was used for each typeface, then \\"divided cases\\", pairs of cases for majuscules and minuscules, were introduced in the region of today's Belgium by 1563, England by 1588, and France before 1723. The terms upper and lower case originate from this division. By convention, when the two cases were taken out of the storage rack and placed on a rack on the compositor's desk, the case containing the capitals and small capitals stood at a steeper angle at the back of the desk, with the case for the small letters, punctuation, and spaces being more easily reached at a shallower angle below it to the front of the desk, hence upper and lower case. Though pairs of cases were used in English-speaking countries and many European countries in the seventeenth century, in Germany and Scandinavia the single case continued in use. Various patterns of cases are available, often with the compartments for lower-case letters varying in size according to the frequency of use of letters, so that the commonest letters are grouped together in larger boxes at the centre of the case. The compositor takes the letter blocks from the compartments and places them in a composing stick, working from left to right and placing the letters upside down with the nick to the top, then sets the assembled type in a galley.

His literary work is recognised for a sense of irony that reveals how easily people can be fooled. Writing in French in the 1950s, Oyono had only a brief literary career, but his anti-colonialist novels are considered classics of 20th century African literature; his first novel, Une vie de boy‚Äîpublished in 1956 and later translated as Houseboy‚Äîis considered particularly important. Beginning in the 1960s, Oyono had a long career of service as a diplomat and as a minister in the government of Cameroon. As one of President Paul Biya's top associates, he ultimately served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1992 to 1997 and then as Minister of State for Culture from 1997 to 2007. He was also Chairman of UNICEF from 1977 to 1978. Diplomatic and political career Oyono was born near Ebolowa in the South Province of Cameroon. After obtaining his secondary education in Yaound√©, Oyono studied in Paris. Following Cameroon's independence, Oyono was a member of the Cameroonian delegation to the United Nations in 1960, when the country was admitted to the UN. Oyono subsequently served as Cameroon's ambassador to various countries from 1965 to 1974. He was briefly the Ambassador to Liberia in 1965, then served as ambassador to the Benelux countries and the European Communities from 1965 to 1968 and as ambassador to France, with additional accreditation for Spain, Italy, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, from 1969 to 1974. From 1974 to 1982 he was Cameroon's Permanent Representative to the United Nations;. he acted as President of the United Nations Security Council in place of the United Kingdom's Ivor Richard at the 1,866th meeting of the Security Council on 16 December 1975,\\"Presidents of the Security Council : 1970‚Äì1979\\", United Nations website. and was Chairman of UNICEF from 1977 to 1978.Officers of the UNICEF Executive Board 1946‚Äì2014, UNICEFExecutive Board, UNICEF From 1982 to 1985 he again served as ambassador to various countries: first as ambassador to Algeria and Libya, then as ambassador to the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries. In 1985, President Paul Biya recalled Oyono from London and appointed him as Secretary- General of the Presidency of Cameroon. Oyono remained in the post for about a year before Biya instead appointed him as Minister of Town Planning and Housing in 1986.West Africa, issues 3,600‚Äì3,616 (1986), page 2,486. The post of Secretary-General of the Presidency was historically very powerful, but Oyono's stint in the office was associated with a weakening of it under President Biya; significantly, Oyono was moved from the Secretariat-General to an ordinary ministry‚Äîeffectively a demotion.Mark Dike DeLancy, Rebecca Neh Mbuh, and Mark W. DeLancy, Historical Dictionary of Cameroon (fourth edition, 2010), Scarecrow Press, pages 337‚Äì338. Although Oyono was dismissed from the government in 1990, he was subsequently appointed as Minister of Foreign Relations on 27 November 1992, serving in that position until he was instead named Minister of State for Culture on 8 December 1997. Oyono was a member of the National Commission for the co-ordination of President Biya's re-election campaign in the October 2004 presidential election and was the president of the campaign's support and follow-up committee in the South Province.\\"President Paul Biya selects campaign team\\" , 2004 presidential election website.

It is also a community entirely within Carmarthenshire, bordered by those of Llangeler and Cenarth, also in Carmarthenshire, and by Llandyfriog in Ceredigion. Adpar is the part of town on the Ceredigion side of the River Teifi. It was formerly called Trefhedyn and was an ancient Welsh borough in its own right. The area including Adpar had a population of 1,883 according to the 2011 census. History Newcastle Emlyn, 1804 The remains of the Norman castle. The town takes its name from the cantref of Emlyn, an administrative district in medieval Dyfed. The cantref became part of the Norman March in the 12th century. Notable buildings in the town include a ruined 13th-century castle, first mentioned in Brut y Tywysogion in 1215, when it was seized by Llewelyn the Great ().The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg609 It was captured by the Welsh during the revolt of 1287‚Äì1288 and also by Owain Glynd≈µr in 1403. The population in 1841 was under 1,000.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol. III, London, 1847, Charles Knight, p. 1,013. Newcastle Emlyn has a town hall and a secondary school, Ysgol Gyfun Emlyn. The town's attractions include an art gallery, the Attic Theatre company and the National Woollen Museum. The Teifi Valley Railway is nearby, although the town has not had a passenger train service since 1952. Economy In 1932, the former Co-operative creamery was reopened by Dried Milk Products to make cheese. After new parent Unigate decided to sell off its non-milk related dairies, it was bought by the Milk Marketing Board in 1979, but closed again in 1983. Reopened latterly by Saputo, it now manufactures mozzarella cheese using locally sourced dairy produce and is the town's largest employer. Transport In 1895, the Teifi Valley Railway of the Great Western Railway (GWR) reached Newcastle Emlyn railway station. Originally conceived as a broad-gauge line between Carmarthen and Cardigan by the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway, it was absorbed into the GWR, which developed the line only as far as Newcastle Emlyn. Passenger services ceased in 1952, but goods services continued until 1973, due in part to milk train services to the cheese-producing creamery. After the goods service ceased, the lines were removed and the station demolished. Demography According to the United Kingdom census 2011 Newcastle Emlyn had a population of 1,883, including Adpar on the Ceredigion side of the River Teifi. A 2017 population estimate put it at 1,888, of whom 52 per cent were female and 48 per cent male, with 379 aged 0‚Äì17 years, 979 aged 18‚Äì64, and 530 aged over 65. The 2001 UK census had 69 per cent of the 950 people then living in Newcastle Emlyn speaking fluent Welsh, although the proportion fell in the next decade to 54 per cent, as the town population increased to 1,138 aged 3 or over by 2011. The drop in Welsh usage in Newcastle Emlyn between 2001 and 2011 was among the biggest in Wales, though not uncommon across Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. The latest Estyn inspection report in 2012 on the town's English-medium secondary school notes that only 12 per cent of pupils came from homes where Welsh is spoken, with 31 per cent considered fluent in the language. Parents have the option of sending their children to a designated Welsh-medium secondary school, Ysgol Dyffryn Teifi in Llandysul, Ceredigion. Only 64.8 per cent of the town's residents were born in Wales. The town has a dual-language primary school,School site.

Legend The entrance to King George's Field in Church Lane, Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire. Holy Trinity Church is in the background on the right. A legend of the Wyvern of Newcastle Emlyn (Gwiber Castell Newydd Emlyn) tells how on a fair day when the town was full, a winged wyvern breathing fire and smoke landed on the castle walls, stared threateningly, then settled down to sleep. The general terror gave way to an effort by a few townsfolk to destroy it. A soldier waded the Teifi to a vantage point on the castle side and released a red cloak into the river. The creature, suddenly woken, caught sight of the cloak, fell on it with shrieks and tore it to shreds, but was shot in its vulnerable underparts. The assailant escaped to safety. The dying wyvern turned over and floated down the river, its wound gushing venom that fouled the water and killed all the fish. There was joy at the monster's death.Newcastle Emlyn Millennium Edition Historical Notes About Our Town p. 10, Pamela Jenkins (1999) Castle Publications.

Hermogenes' rules on symmetry and proportion define what Vitruvius calls \\"eustyle\\" (eu stylos \\"right column\\"), an architectural ideal that prescribed a series of proportional relationships for temples that was all derived from the diameter of the column, as a module or unit of measure. Ideal \\"eustyle\\" intercolumniation (the space between the columns) should be two-and-a-quarter column-thicknesses, and the height of the Ionic column nine-and-a-half times its diameter. If the intercolumniation was to be tighter, columns should be taller in their proportions, and thicker if they were farther spaced. It is this sense of rational relations that Vitruvius is expressing when he writes \\"in the members of a temple there ought to be the greatest harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the general magnitude of the whole.\\" One element in a classical system cannot be changed without changing the other proportions too. The geographer Strabo mentions this temple, the third greatest temple after those in Didyma and Ephesus, but considered finest of all for its proportions. Consequently, archaeologists have been curious to rediscover the site of Hermogenes' temple, traces of which are not apparent. Even the site of the colony of the mother-city of Magnesia in Thessaly was not established until W. M. Leake got the site correctly identified in 1824 (Journal of a Tour in Asia Minor pp 242ff). In the winter of 1842-3, a French team struggled with swampy ground and a high water table at the heavily sedimented site, and succeeded in removing 40 meters of the temple's frieze, comprising 41 blocks, and some other architectural elements. These were taken to the Louvre Museum, but the excavations were never published. In 1887 Osman Hamdi Bey, director of the Archaeological Museums of Constantinople, carried off to Constantinople a further 20 meters of frieze blocks from the Artemision. More rigorous excavations at Magnesia were undertaken by the German Institute at Constantinople in the 1890s and by German and Turkish scholars since 1984. The result is that sculptural elements of Hermogenes' Artemision are scattered among the Pergamum Museum, Berlin, the Louvre Museum, Paris and Istanbul. Since the 1980s, enough remnants of the U-shaped raised colonnaded altar that faced the temple have been recovered to permit modern reconstructions of its original appearance, for the first time since Antiquity. Hermogenes was the architect of the hexastyle peripteral Temple of Dionysus in Teos, also mentioned by Vitruvius. It was the largest temple to Dionysus in the ancient world; only the platform (stylobate) remains, measuring 18.5 by 35 meters (61 by 115 feet). It is in the western part of the lower city, against the walls. It was constructed early in the 2nd century BCE and later reconsecrated to the cult of Tiberius and partly rebuilt during Hadrian‚Äôs reign. The temple has been excavated by a team of the University of Ankara. Hermogenes also appears to have written a text, no longer extant, on his symmetrical principles.

It is the third largest urban area in Ceredigion, after Aberystwyth and Cardigan, and has a campus of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. At the 2011 Census, the population was 2,970. Lampeter is the smallest university town in the United Kingdom. The university adds approximately 1,000 people. History The Norman castle of Pont Steffan (Stephen's Bridge in English) occupying a strategic position beside the River Teifi was destroyed in 1187 after it had been conquered by Owain Gwynedd. The remains of the castle later became the foundations for C. R. Cockerell's college building and still form part of the university campus. Cardiganshire was one of the royal counties established by Edward I after the defeat of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf) at Cilmeri in 1282, when Lampeter fell under direct Royal Control. This, however, had little effect on the town and the Welsh language and culture continued to thrive. The first Borough Charter was granted in 1284 to Rhys ap Meredydd who was given the right to hold a weekly market. As many as eight fairs were also held each year under successive charters.Jenkins, J. Geraint. Ceredigion: Interpreting an Ancient County. Gwasg Careg Gwalch (2005) pg. 27. One of these was the Dalis Horse Fair. The town was ruled by a local aristocracy who lived in elegant mansions, including Brynhywel, Maesyfelin and the Lloyd baronets of Peterwell. As magistrates, they handed out the severest of penalties to offenders. The fairs and markets had become rowdy occasions characterised by violence and drunkenness and the stocks and whipping post in front of the town hall were frequently put to use in the 18th century. The town developed the crafts, services and industries to cater to the needs of the rural area. There were several woollen mills, one of which in the mid-18th century was already producing the complex double-woven tapestry cloth later to become associated with the Welsh woollen industry. There were also blacksmiths, a leather tannery, carpenters, saddlers, bootmakers and hatters. The town was one of the main centres on the Welsh drovers' road for the dispatch of cattle and sheep on foot to the markets in England. A large number of inns point to the town's importance as a rural centre.Jenkins, J. Geraint. Ceredigion: Interpreting an Ancient County. Gwasg Careg Gwalch (2005) pg. 29. Lampeter's war memorial, sculpted by Sir William Goscombe John (1860‚Äì1952), was unveiled in September 1921. University The college St David's College was founded in Lampeter in 1822 by Thomas Burgess, Bishop of St David's, to provide training for those wishing to join the Anglican priesthood. It was the first institution of higher education in Wales and the third oldest in England and Wales after Oxford and Cambridge. In 1852 it was granted a charter to award the BD degree and in 1865 another charter enabled it to confer BA degrees in liberal arts. Its central building, based on an Oxbridge-style quadrangle was designed by Charles Robert Cockerell. In 1871, it became a constituent part of the University of Wales as St David's University College and was renamed the University of Wales, Lampeter, in 1996. In 2008, the Lampeter institution's original charter was used to reform higher education in West Wales with the integration of Trinity College Carmarthen, further education colleges in Cardigan and Llanelli, and the technical college known as Swansea Metropolitan into the University of Wales Trinity St. David. The university's Rugby Union team was the first in Wales. It was formed in the 1850s by Rowland Williams who introduced the game from Cambridge. Governance Lampeter is the name of the electoral ward which is coterminous with the community, though prior to 1995 it was a ward for Dyfed County Council and also included the neighbouring community of Llangybi. Since 1995 the ward has elected two county councillors to Ceredigion County Council. The ward has elected a Welsh Labour Party councillor and an Independent councillor at each election since 1995. At the local level Lampeter is represented by 14 town councillors on Lampeter Town Council. Culture Theatr Felinfach * Lampeter's local Eisteddfod, Eisteddfod Rhys Thomas James Pantyfedwen, is held annually over the August bank holiday. It is particularly noteworthy for its competition for singers under the age of 30, colloquially known as Llais Llwyfan Llambed ('the voice of Lampeter's stage'). * Lampeter Museum covers the cultural and agricultural development of the town as well as the history of the college. * Theatr Felinfach, a small regional theatre located outside the village of Ystrad Aeron in Dyffryn Aeron, about 7 miles from Lampeter. * During the Second World War, Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin lived at Plas Gelli, a secluded mansion just outside Talsarn.D. N. Thomas, Dylan Thomas: a Farm, Two Mansions and a Bungalow, Seren, 2000. The Dylan Thomas Trail links Talsarn and Lampeter with the other places in Ceredigion associated with the poet, such as Aberaeron and New Quay. * In 1968, William Julian Cayo-Evans first marched his paramilitary nationalist 'Free Wales Army' from Lampeter. Sport Lampeter has a strong sporting community, which includes Cwmann and Llanybydder. Many sports are played in the town, with rugby union being the most popular. Lampeter fielded the first rugby union team in Wales. The sport is believed to have arrived in the late 1840s, meaning the town has a very long tie and history with the sport. The town is represented by Lampeter Town Rugby from under-sevens to under-sixteens, youth at junior levels, and at senior levels by both the 1st XV and by a 2nd XV, named Lampeter Saints. The popularity of the game can be seen when playing, especially during 1st XV or youth games, with large crowds gathering on Saturday afternoons. Many other sports are played in the town, including association football, with the town being represented by a football team, their pitch being directly next to the main pitch of Lampeter Rugby Club. The football team has junior teams as well as a 1st and 2nd team. The town is served by a leisure centre, which has a gym, the main hall and modern tennis facilities. The town has a swimming pool and also a bowling green. Transport Aberaeron In 1866, transport in Lampeter was greatly improved with the opening of the railway linking and . In 1911, a branch line opened to Aberaeron. Following the nationalisation of the railways, the passenger service to Aberaeron ceased in 1951. Passenger trains on the main line to Carmarthen and Aberystwyth continued until December 1964 when the track was badly damaged by flooding south of Aberystwyth and through trains were suspended. This was the era of the \\"Beeching Axe\\" and it took little political persuasion to decide that the cost of repairs would be unjustified. The remaining passenger services were withdrawn. Milk trains continued to the processing factories at Pont Llanio until 1970, and Felinfach until 1973. The line was eventually lifted in 1975. However, the section of the old line between Bronwydd Arms and Danycoed Halt still exists and is used by the Gwili Railway, a steam railway preservation society which operates a regular timetable during summer months. Regular bus services operate through the town, connecting Lampeter to Aberystwyth, Carmarthen and Swansea. Two buses a day continue beyond Swansea providing a through service to Cardiff.

It is engaged when the transmission shift lever selector is placed in the Park position, which is always the first position (topmost on a column shift, frontmost on a floor shift) in all cars sold in the United States since 1965 (when the order was standardised by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)) through SAE J915,http://standards.sae.org/j915_196507/ and in most other vehicles worldwide. Design and operation The parking pawl locks the transmission's output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main components of a parking pawl mechanism are the parking gear, parking pawl, actuator rod, cam collar, cam plate, pivot pin and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are put in place to avoid this condition and engage the pawl only when the vehicle has come to a standstill.Jeyakumaran, Jeku; Zhang, Nong (2008). \\"Dynamic Analysis of an Automatic Transmission Parking Mechanism\\".

Recommendations Most vehicle manufacturers\\"Chevy Cruze Owner's Manual\\" . Chevrolet.com. and auto mechanics\\"Driver's Ed Guru - Always set the parking brake\\". DriverSEdGuru.com do not recommend using the transmission's parking pawl as the sole means of securing a parked vehicle, instead recommending it should only be engaged after first applying the vehicle's parking brake. Constant use of only the parking pawl, especially when parking on a steep incline, means that driveline components, and transmission internals, are kept constantly under stress, and can cause wear and eventual failure of the parking pawl or transmission linkage. The pawl might also fail or break if the vehicle is pushed with sufficient force, if the parking brake is not firmly engaged. Replacement can be an expensive operation since it not only requires removing the transmission from the vehicle, but it's usually the first component to be installed in the gearbox case during a complete rebuild. It is highly inadvisable to use the parking pawl to stop a vehicle in motion. Modern parking pawls are connected to a safety mechanism that prevents the pawl from engaging unless the vehicle is stopped first. The pawl mechanism is generally not strong enough to stop a vehicle in motion, if it engages at all. Under that much stress, the pawl may simply break off in the transmission, leading to costly repairs.

Located on Cardigan Bay with a harbour and large sandy beaches, it lies on the Ceredigion Coast Path, and remains a popular seaside resort and traditional fishing town. St Llwchaiarn's Church History Until the early 19th century, New Quay consisted of a few thatched cottages surrounded by agricultural land, the natural harbour providing a safe mooring for fishing boats and a few small trading vessels. The New Quay Harbour Act was passed in 1834 and a stone pier was constructed at a cost of ¬£4,700. Trading activity increased and new houses were built as economic migrants arrived. Shipbuilding began to take place and the town increased in size with the construction of terraced housing up the slopes of the sheltered bay.Jenkins, J. Geraint. Ceredigion: Interpreting an Ancient County. Gwasg Careg Gwalch (2005) pg. 63. By the 1840s, more than three hundred workmen were being employed in shipbuilding in three centres, New Quay itself, Traethgwyn, a bay just to the north, and Cei-bach, a pebble beach further north below a wooded cliff. Here were constructed not only smacks and schooners for sailing along the coast, but also larger vessels for sailing to the Americas and Australia. At that time, as well as shipwrights, New Quay had half a dozen blacksmith shops, three sail makers, three ropewalks and a foundry. Most of the male inhabitants of the town were mariners or employed in occupations linked with the sea.Jenkins, J. Geraint. Ceredigion: Interpreting an Ancient County. Gwasg Careg Gwalch (2005) pg. 64. By 1870, shipbuilding had ceased at New Quay but most of the men living there still went to sea. There were navigation schools in the town and many of the last square riggers that sailed the world were captained by New Quay men. The observant tourist can still see the old warehouses, now put to new uses, lengths of chain, metal rings and capstans, and a list of tolls for exports and imports can still be seen outside the harbourmaster's office. New Quay Golf Club (now defunct) first appeared in 1909. The club and course closed in the mid 1920s.\\"New Quay Golf Club\\", \\"Golf's Missing Links\\". There are a number of available publications about the town's history and residents.(1) S. Passmore (2012) Farmers and Figureheads: the Port of New Quay and its Hinterland, Grosvenor House. (2) R. Bryan (2012) New Quay: A History in Pictures, Llanina Books. (3) W. J. Lewis (1987) New Quay and Llanarth, Aberystwyth. Governance New Quay is the name of the electoral ward which is coterminous with the community. Since 1995 the ward has elected one county councillor to Ceredigion County Council. Independent councillor Gill Hopley represented the ward until the May 2017 elections when she was beaten by Independent candidate Dan Potter. At the local level New Quay is represented by 10 town councillors on New Quay Town Council.  Tourism and attractions  Key attractions for holidaymakers include the picturesque harbour and expansive sandy beach, as well as the ability to see the population of bottlenose dolphins that lives in Cardigan Bay. The town has a heritage centre and marine wildlife centre, as well as the usual collection of shops and restaurants. Nearby New Quay Honey Farm, the largest bee farm in Wales, has a live bee exhibition and sells honey, mead and beeswax. The outskirts of the town feature many large holiday parks and caravan sites. The annual Cardigan Bay Regatta, usually in August, has been conducted since at least the 1870s. Events now include inshore sports (swimming, rowing, etc.) and dinghy and cruiser racing. In addition to the hospitality industry, there is still significant employment in sea fishing and fish processing.  Local facilities  As well as shops, restaurants and pubs, New Quay has a large primary school, a doctors' surgery, a small branch of the county library service and a fire station. New Quay Lifeboat Station, operated by the RNLI, houses two lifeboats: a Mersey class named Frank and Lena Clifford of Stourbridge in dedication to its main benefactors and an inshore inflatable D class. In 2014 the station celebrated 150 years of service, during which period it made 940 callouts. Public transport is provided by regular bus services to Aberaeron, Cardigan and Aberystwyth. The town has never had a train service, as schemes to open routes to Cardigan or Newcastle Emlyn were abandoned in the 1860s, and that from the Aberaeron to Lampeter branch line (the Lampeter, Aberayron and New Quay Light Railway) was never completed due to the First World War. A few miles outside New Quay is a honey farm. There is a public park at the top of New Quay next to a tennis court.  Dylan Thomas  New Quay is one of several places in Wales to claim a link with writer Dylan Thomas, who lived on the cliffs in a bungalow called Majoda from September 1944 until May 1945.BBC Wales - Arts - Dylan Thomas - New Quay Accordingly, the town is often cited as partial inspiration for the fictitious village of Llareggub in Under Milk Wood.See D N Thomas (2004) Dylan Remembered 1935-53, vol 2, pp285-313, Seren, as well as S. W. Rhydderch (2015) Ceredigion Coast: Llareggub and the Black Lion in A Dylan Odessey: 15 Literary Tour Maps, ed. S. Edmonds, Literature Wales/Graffeg. Thomas had previously visited the town when he and Caitlin had lived at Plas Gelli, Talsarn, in 1942-43; his New Quay pub poem, Sooner than you can water milk, dates from this period.Sooner than... is reproduced on p189 of D.N. Thomas (2000) A Farm, Two Mansions and a Bungalow, Seren. He also had an aunt and cousins living in the town. Llareggub‚Äôs occupational profile as a town of seafarers, fishermen, cockle gatherers and farmers has been examined through an analysis of the 1939 War Register, comparing the returns for New Quay with those for Laugharne, Ferryside and Llansteffan.Thomas, D.N. (2019) Llareggub and the 1939 War Register, published at The-1939-war-register Much of the location filming for The Edge of Love, a 2008 film based around Thomas and starring Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley, was carried out in and around New Quay.The Edge of Love (2008) - Filming locations Dylan Thomas' principal patron in the area was Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden, whose summer residence was Plas Llanina, an historic manor house perched atop the cliffs at Cei Bach next to the tiny church dedicated to St Ina. He allowed Thomas to use the old apple house at the bottom of the manor's walled garden as a quiet place in which to write. The writer and puppeteer, Walter Wilkinson, visited New Quay in 1947, and his essay on the town captures its character and atmosphere as Thomas would have found it two years earlier.W. Wilkinson (1948) Puppets in Wales, Bles. The New Quay chapter is also available online at Wilkinson The town has played on its connections with Thomas to attract visitors in recent years through, for example, the creation of the Dylan Thomas Trail which maps the poet's links with the area.D N Thomas (2002) The Dylan Thomas Trail, Y LolfaHolidays - New Quay Tourist Information  Plas Llanina  Plas Llanina has quite a chequered history including some interesting owners and various stories associated with them. By the end of the 18th century it had passed into the ownership of the Jones family, the last of whom was Edward Warren Jones. When he died he left the Llanina Estate to his two godchildren, Mrs Charlotte Lloyd (of Coedmore) and her younger brother, Charles Richard Longcroft. Charlotte and Charles had lived with Edward Warren Jones as children after the deaths of their parents, Capt. Edward Longcroft (d. 1812) and his wife Elizabeth (d. 1809). Indeed, Charles had been born at Plas Llanina while Captain and Mrs Longcroft were living with Mr Jones; there were local rumours that Charlotte and Charles were actually fathered not by Edward Longcroft but by Edward Warren Jones, but this is unsubstantiated.Phillips- Evans, J.

Sudden death is typically used as a tiebreaker when a contest is tied at the end of regulation (normal) playing time or the completion of the normal playing task. An alternative tiebreaker method to sudden death is to play an extra, shortened segment of the game. In association football 30 minutes of extra time (overtime) after 90 minutes of normal time, or in golf one playoff round (18 holes) after four standard rounds (72 holes) are two alternatives. Sudden death playoffs typically end more quickly than the shortened play alternative. Reducing the variability of the event's duration assists those scheduling television time and team travel. Fans may see sudden death as exciting and suspenseful, or they may view the format as compromising the sport, compared to play during regulation time. For example, prior to 2012, the National Football League (American football) used a sudden-death rule that encouraged the team possessing the ball to just kick a field goal to end the game rather than striving to score a touchdown. Sudden death yields a victor for the contest without requiring a specific period of time. It may be called \\"next score wins\\" or similar, although in some games, the winner may result from penalizing the other competitor for a mistake. Sudden death has been called sudden victory to avoid the mention of death and serious disease, particularly in sports with a high risk of physical injury. This euphemism became one of announcer Curt Gowdy's idiosyncrasies in 1971 when the AFC divisional championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins went into overtime. North American professional sports using a sudden death method of settling a tied game include the modified version now employed by the National Football League, the National Hockey League and, also in a modified sense, the PGA Tour (golf). Baseball uses a unique method of tie-breaking that incorporates elements of sudden death. In baseball, a winning run scored by the home team in an extra inning is often referred to as a walk-off, as the players can immediately walk off the field. In some goal-scoring games sudden death extra time may be given in which the first goal scored wins. In association football it is called the golden goal, although it was abolished from the Laws of the Game in 2004 by FIFA. American football Sudden death has been perceived as a poor fit for gridiron football because the process gives an inherent advantage to the team who starts with possession of the ball: they can end the game immediately by driving a relatively short distance into field goal range and then kicking a field goal, but defensive scores such as the pick-six or the safety are much more rare. All organized forms of American football abolished pure sudden death for overtime as of the 2011 season. High school football and college football, never used it, instead either allowing ties to stand or using alternatives like the Kansas Playoff. =National Football League= Until 1940, all National Football League games tied at the end of regulation time ended as a tie. Late in the 1940 season, NFL President Carl Storck announced that sudden death periods would be authorized for any playoff game needed to decide either division title. This did not apply to the league championship game, which would crown co-champions in the event of a tie.New York Times, November 19, 1940. Novel Plan Adopted to Decide Play-Offs, p. 22 Commissioner Elmer Layden approved a similar arrangement for the 1941 season, with the same limitation. Sudden death overtime was approved for the NFL championship game in 1946New York Times, April 30, 1946. Danzig, Allison, Pro Giants To Play Seven Home Games, p. 27. and remains in effect.New York Times, December 18, 1948, Cards And Eagles Evenly Matched, p. 17.New York Times, December 11, 1950, Sudden Death Overtime For Play-Off Contests, p. 33 The first playoff game requiring overtime was the 1958 NFL Championship Game.Gifford and Richmond, pg. 210 In 1974, the NFL adopted a 15-minute sudden-death overtime period for regular-season games; in it was cut to 10 minutes. The game ended as a tie if neither team scores in overtime. When a team gets near the end zone, it typically tried to kick a field goal. An overtime game can also be won by scoring a touchdown (in such an event, the extra point is not attempted). This usually happened on a play that began with field position far enough away from the end zone to make a field goal difficult if not impossible, but it can also result from a team choosing not to attempt a field goal until reaching fourth down, even if the team enters an easy field goal range; this strategy only works if the team can maintain possession of the ball and does not fumble the ball away, throw an interception or lose enough yardage to back out of field goal range. Only thrice has an overtime game been won by a safety. In recent years, sportscasters have referred to such scoring plays as \\"walk-offs,\\" as both teams can walk off the field after the play. Since the 2010‚Äì11 playoffs, in the post-season, each team was allowed at least one possession to score in overtime, unless the team receiving the kickoff scored a touchdown or if the defensive team scored a touchdown or safety on the same possession. True sudden death rules applied if both teams have had their initial possession and the game remains tied. This rule did not actually come into use during the 2010 playoffs, with the first overtime game under the new rules not occurring until 2011, with the Denver Broncos scoring a long touchdown on their first play from scrimmage against the Pittsburgh Steelers. This rule was adopted for the start of the 2012 regular season. It was adopted to counter the criticism that the outcome of overtime games was very frequently decided by the coin toss, as the team which won it usually attempted only enough offensive action to maneuver into field goal range and seldom made a real effort to score a touchdown. In the regular season, games still tied after one full overtime period will continue to be allowed to end in a tie. A tied game in regulation did not occur in the Super Bowl until Super Bowl LI (51). For information on games that have taken a long time under sudden death, see Overtime. =Arena football= In arena football from to , each team was allowed one possession in the first overtime, after which the leading team wins unless the score is still tied, then sudden death rules applied thereafter. (A similar, modified sudden death format, with a 10-minute limit, was used in the NFL Europa League.) Prior to 2007 the league used extra time, a 7.5-minute extra period; if the game was still tied at this point, it was recorded as a tied game. The modified sudden death rules resulted in a definite conclusion after one overtime period. (Only one tied game was recorded under each of the two prior overtime rules.) From 2007 to 2019, all Arena football games, both regular season and playoff, ended with a winner. Any succeeding overtime periods were true sudden death periods. This included both games of all semifinal series. Association football Sudden death has a controversial history in association football. Important matches were traditionally resolved by replaying the entire match, however in the era of television and tight travel schedules this is often impracticable. Replays are still used in some major competitions (like the FA Cup). In many matches, if the score is tied after the full 90 minutes, a draw results; however, if one team must be eliminated, some form of tie-breaking must occur. Originally, two 15-minute halves of extra time were held and if the teams remained equal at the end of the halves, kicks from the penalty mark are held. To try to decrease the chances of requiring kicks from the penalty mark, the IFAB, the world law making body of the sport, experimented with new rules. The golden goal rule transformed the overtime periods into sudden death until the periods were over, where shootouts would occur. As this became unpopular, the silver goal rule was instituted, causing the game to end if the scores were not equal after the first 15-minute period as well as the second. The silver goal has also fallen into disrepute so UEFA Euro 2004 was the last event to use it; after which the original tie-breaking methods were restored. The main criticism of golden goal is the quickness of ending the game, and the pressure on coaches and players. Once a goal is scored, the game is over and the opponent cannot attempt to answer the goal within the remaining time. Therefore, teams would place more emphasis on not conceding a goal rather than scoring a goal, and many golden goal extra time periods remained scoreless. In NCAA collegiate play in the United States, however, sudden death, adopted in 1997 for all championship play in addition to regular season play, remains. In 2005, the Division II Women's Championship game ended in sudden death as a goal was scored three minutes into the overtime to end the championship match. Sudden death is also prevalent in youth play, for the safety of players. If the teams are still tied after the initial allocated number in the penalty shoot-out, the game goes to sudden-death penalties, where each team takes a further one penalty each, repeated until only one team scores, resulting in the winning of the game. Boxing In amateur boxing, if both scores are equal and no draw option is allowed by the contest regulations, an extra round is appointed; whoever wins that round, scores the plus to one's score, and wins the match by a slight margin. Badminton In badminton, if a set is tied at 29‚Äìall, golden point is played; whoever scores this point wins it. Baseball and softball Baseball and softball are not true sudden-death sports, but they have one comparable situation. Baseball and softball games cannot end until both teams have had an equal number of turns at bat, unless further play (by the home team if they lead after innings) cannot affect the outcome. In the final scheduled inning (typically, in professional and advanced amateur leagues the ninth inning, but usually the seventh for youth leagues and softball, and the sixth for leagues for subteens such as Little League), if the visitors complete their turn at bat and still trail the hosts, the game ends. If the visitors lead or the game is tied, the hosts take their \\"last ups\\" at bat. If the hosts should exceed the visitors' score, the game ends at the conclusion of the play on which the hosts take this insurmountable lead. (If the final scheduled inning ends in a tie, multiple extra innings will be played, and that procedure repeats until one team leads, which wins the game.) The ability to bat last is an advantage of being the home team. It is said that \\"visitors must play to win; hosts need only play to tie\\" because tying forces an extra inning. A tied game in the bottom of the final scheduled inning puts pressure on the visitors. For example, with a runner on third base and fewer than two outs, the visitors cannot afford even to get certain types of out that would let the game-ending run score after the out. A scoring play that ends the game is called a \\"walk-off\\", a term originally coined by Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley in about 1988, who referred to game-ending home runs as \\"walk-off pieces\\", as all that is left for the visiting team to do was to walk off the field. It was popularized by a sports broadcaster after 2000, and is sometimes mistakenly thought to have been so named because \\"everyone walks off the field\\" after the winning run scores. A game-ending home run is an exception to the rule stated above; the game does not end when the winning run scores, but continues until the batter and all runners score (provided they run the bases correctly), although prior to 1920, a batter hitting a ball outside of the park to end a game was only given credit for as many bases as required to score the winning run; if the winning run was on third when the ball was hit, the batter got credit for only a single. Basketball Basketball does not traditionally employ sudden death to decide games; it instead uses multiple five-minute overtime periods to determine the result of games tied after regulation play. The entire overtime is played; if the game remains tied, this procedure is repeated. The NBA Summer League, a developmental summer league, employs sudden death basketball after the first overtime. The rules state Double overtime & thereafter is sudden death (first team to score a point wins). In the first sudden death professional basketball game, Devin Ebanks hit a game winner with 45 seconds elapsed for the D-League Select team, beating the summer league Atlanta Hawks. Another form of basketball does employ a sudden-death overtime. 3x3, a formalized version of the half-court three-on-three game, uses an untimed overtime period that ends by rule once either team has scored 2 points. In this form of the sport, shots taken from behind the \\"three-point\\" arc are worth 2 points and all other shots are worth 1 point. Fencing An individual fencing bout lasts for five touches in a poule match, or 15 touches in a direct elimination (DE) match in all three weapons (√©p√©e, foil, and sabre. Although sabre bouts rarely go to full-time, the same time frames apply) Matches are also timed (three minutes for a poule match, and three periods of three minutes for a DE). If neither fencer has reached five or 15 points within the time limit, the leading fencer is deemed the winner. However, if the fencers are tied after the allotted time, one minute of extra time is added. Before resuming the bout, one fencer is randomly awarded \\"priority\\". The first fencer to score a valid hit within extra time wins the match; if no valid hits are scored within the time, that fencer with priority is declared the victor. In the normal course of a match, there is a de facto sudden death situation if both fencers are tied at four (or 14) touches each. The final hit is called \\"la belle\\". The fencers may salute each other before playing for the final point. Golf In individual match play, players level after the regulation 18 or 36 holes will play extra holes in sudden death. In team tournaments, players may gain half a point each for a tie rather than play sudden death; this is the case in the Ryder Cup, for example. In the Presidents Cup, there was provision for a single-player sudden death shootout if the entire competition ended in a tie. When this came to pass in 2003, the tiebreak was unfinished at dusk. There was no provision for an extra day's play, and both team captains agreed to declare the match tied and share the trophy. Traditionally, professional stroke play golf tournaments ending in a tie were played off the next day with an eighteen-hole match. Modern considerations such as television coverage and the tight travel schedule of most leading golfers have led to this practice being almost entirely abandoned, and in all but the most important tournaments, the champion is determined by sudden death. All players tied after the completion of regulation play are taken to a predetermined hole, and then play it and others in order as needed. If at least two players are tied, player(s) who score higher on a hole than the other competitors is/are immediately eliminated, and those still tied continue play until one remaining player has a lower score for a hole than any of the others remaining, who is declared the winner. Of the four men's major championships, only The Masters uses a sudden- death playoff format, first used in 1979. Through 2017 (and last used in 2008), the had an 18-hole playoff at stroke play on the day after the main tournament, with sudden-death if needed after 18 holes. A two-hole aggregate playoff is used since 2018, followed by sudden-death if needed. The Open Championship first used a four-hole total stroke playoff in 1989, which was reduced to three holes for 2019. The PGA Championship uses a three-hole total- stroke playoff, first used in 2000, it introduced the sudden-death playoff to the majors in 1977, and used it seven times through 1996. Sudden death is used if a tie exists at the end of the scheduled playoff. Ice hockey Sudden- death overtime has traditionally been used in playoff and championship games in hockey. It has been used in the National Hockey League throughout the league's history. The first NHL game with sudden-death overtime was game four of the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals. Currently, the NHL, American Hockey League, and ECHL also use the sudden-death system in their regular seasons, playing a five-minute overtime period when the score is tied at the end of regulation time. In 2000, the AHL reduced the teams to four players each during the five- minute overtime. (But any two-man advantage is administered with five-on-three play rather than four-on-two.) The ECHL and NHL both changed to the four-on- four overtime format in 2001, with the International Olympic Committee following by no later than 2010. By 2015 the NHL went to the three-on-three format. In the SPHL, a class A minor league, the overtime is three-on-three, with the team that would be on the power play given a fourth, and a fifth attacker respectively instead, and any penalty in the final two minutes results in a penalty shot instead of a power play. If neither team scores during this period, the teams use a penalty-shot shootout, consisting of three players in the NHL or five players in the minor leagues, to determine the winner. In the NHL, if no team wins this shootout, a 1-by-1, sudden-death shootout ensues. No player may shoot twice until every non-goaltender on the bench has taken a shot. During championship playoffs, however, all games are played to a conclusion resulting in a victory for one team and a loss for the other. These are true sudden-death games, which have gone on into as many as six additional full 20-minute periods with five players, instead of the five- minute period with at least three players. IIHF hockey, since 2019, repeats the overtime procedure for gold medal games if neither team scores after one 20-minute, sudden-death overtime period; shootouts will occur otherwise.New OT format at Worlds The shootout is decided in best-of-5 rounds, then round by round (in other words, if one team scores in the 6th round or beyond and the other fails, the game ends, unlike most professional leagues), and players can shoot as many times as the team desires (first 5 rounds are done in order, then reversely thereafter; may use new or same players). (There is a 5-minute overtime in round-robin games [10 minutes in elimination/bronze medal games], plus the best-of-5-round [best-of-3 rounds in round robin] shootout procedure in elimination/bronze medal games.) Judo In the case of a tie in competition judo, the match proceeds to Golden Score, another form of Sudden Death. Sudden Death in competition Judo consists of a 5 minute long match, during which the first competitor to achieve a score is awarded the match. Penalties in Judo award points to the other competitor, making fair-play of absolute importance. If no victor is decided in Golden Score, the match is decided based on a Referee's Decision. A Referee's Decision is a vote amongst the Referee and both Judges of the match. Mixed martial arts In mixed martial arts competitions that consist of an even number of rounds, a type of sudden death is sometimes used in the event that each competitor wins an equal number of points. This is not a true sudden death that ends on the first point scored, since MMA competitions do not generally score individual points. Rather, it is a final round of combat, the winner of which is declared the winner of the match. This particular rule, known as \\"Sudden Victory\\", has been commonly seen in previous seasons of the reality television show The Ultimate Fighter when the competition has consisted of two rounds. A sudden victory round rule was also implemented in the tournament to decide Ultimate Fighting Championship's first Flyweight Champion. Professional wrestling Sudden death in wrestling is most commonly seen in Real Canadian Wrestling tournament matches, in which a victor must be decided. This happens in the case of a double knockout or double countout. In the United States, Sudden Death rules occurs mainly in an Iron Man match when there is a tie after the time limit have expired. (Most notably at Wrestlemania XII when the match between Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart ended 0-0 after the 60 minute limit). An example that invoked sudden death occurred in the 2005 Royal Rumble. John Cena and Batista were left, and both men's feet touched the ground at the same time. A comparable draw leading to sudden death might happen if the shoulders of a wrestler applying a submission move are on the mat. Rugby league Drawn National Rugby League premiership and State of Origin series games are subject to sudden death extra time after 80 minutes of play, called the golden point. Golden point consists of two five-minute halves, with the teams swapping ends at the end of the first half. Any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in golden point wins the game for the scoring team - no conversion is attempted if a try is the winning score. In the NRL, the victor in golden point receives two competition points, the loser none. In the event that no further scoring occurs, the game is drawn, and each team receives one point each. Rugby union In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the Rugby World Cup, a match drawn after 80 minutes does not proceed immediately to sudden death conditions. Two 10-minute extra time periods are played first, if scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for a single sudden- death period of 10 minutes to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period. =Rugby sevens= In the World Rugby Sevens Series, a match that ends in draw proceeds to multiple sudden death periods of 5 minutes. Tennis and volleyball In contrast with the usual sudden-death procedure of awarding the victory to the next side to score, tennis and volleyball require that the margin of victory be two. A volleyball game tied at the target score continues until one team's score exceeds the other's by two points. The traditional requirement that a tennis set be won by two games sometimes resulted in men's five-set matches lasting over six hours (including an 8-hour 11-minute set at Wimbledon) or, in women's/doubles' three-set matches, lasting over three hours, which is a major disruption to a television schedule. To shorten matches, sets tied at six games each can now be broken by a single tiebreaker game (for the U.S. Open & Olympics only, deciding set). This is awarded to the first player to score seven points. The winner must lead the loser by two points, so tiebreaker games can become lengthy in their own right. [Exception applies to \\"super tiebreaker\\" since 2019, in which whoever scores 10 points or two straight points after a 9-all tie wins match (Australian Open only), provided the deciding set is tied at 6-all; at Wimbledon, this is employed at 12-all in deciding set.] Tiebreakers are not used in the final set at the French Open.

Its northern suburb of Pensarn lies on the Irish Sea coast. Abergele and Pensarn railway station serves both resorts. Abergele is often overlooked due to the popularity of towns in nearby Rhyl, Prestatyn, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Conwy. Only 46.5% of the population was born in Wales as of the 2011 census. Abergele will be host to the 2020 edition of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!.  Etymology  The meaning of the name can be deduced by being the Welsh word for estuary, river mouth or confluence and the name of the river which flows through the town. is a dialectal form of , which means spear, describing the action of the river cutting through the land. It has also been suggested this river is named because its waters flash brightly. Geography Gwrych Castle The town itself lies on the A55 road and is known for Gwrych Castle. The town is surrounded by woodland covered hillsides, which contain caves with the rare lesser horseshoe bat. The highest hill is Moelfre Isaf (1040 ft) to the south of the town. There are also outstanding views from Cefn-yr-Ogof (669 ft), Tower Hill (587 ft) and Castell Cawr (known locally as Tan y Gopa) which is 189 metres (620 feet). Castell Cawr is an Iron Age hillfort, one of several in the area. Dinorben hillfort to the east of town was destroyed in the 1980s. Abergele is home to a McDonald's fast-food restaurant. Abergele (including Pensarn) has a population of around 10,000 and is part of the Abergele/Rhyl/Prestatyn urban area with a population of 64,000. Approximately 29% of Abergele has a significant knowledge of Welsh. The town also has satellite villages such as Saint George, Betws yn Rhos, Rhyd-y-foel, Belgrano, Llanddulas and Llanfair Talhaearn. Pensarn and Belgrano are significantly less Welsh than the rest of town, with 69.3% of people having no Welsh identity in the 2011 census. History Bridge Street, Abergele circa 1875 Cottages in Abergele Abergele was the site of an important clas (Celtic monastery) and remained settled into the 13th century. A \\"Prince Jonathan of Abergeleu\\" is listed by the B text of the Annals of Wales as dying during the 9th century reign of Rhodri the Great,The Annals of Wales (B text), p. 10. although Charles-Edwards has supposed him to have simply been the monastery's abbot.Charles-Edwards, T.M. \\"The Heir-Apparent in Irish and Welsh Law\\". Celtica, Vol. 9, p. 18090. Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1971. Accessed 27 Feb 2013. Edward I is known to have briefly stayed there in December 1294 during his invasion of Wales to suppress the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn. Sites of historical interest include two Iron Age hillforts; Castell Cawr at Tan y Gopa and Dinorben (now virtually disappeared owing to limestone quarrying) at St. George. On Gallt y Felin Wynt, a hill above the town popularly known as Tower Hill or Bryn T≈µr, is a 17th-century watchtower, partially restored in 1930. There is another Iron Age fort at Pen y Corddyn Mawr hill above Rhyd y Foel. There is also another watchtower, Lady Emily's Tower, which is located near Cefn yr Ogof. Gwrych Castle was built between 1819-25 at the behest of Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh. From 1894 until 1946 it was the residence of the Dundonald family. Gwrych Castle's present owner, California businessman Nick Tavaglione, who bought the landmark in December 1989, put Gwrych up for auction on 2 June 2006, but it failed to sell. The condition of the property is being monitored by the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust. It is undergoing renovation. The boxers Bruce Woodcock (in the late 1940s) and Randolph Turpin (in 1952) trained at Gwrych Castle. The film Prince Valiant, was filmed there in 1996, starring Edward Fox and Katherine Heigl. A curious undated inscription can be found on a tombstone in St Michael's parish church (built on the site of the old clas). It states \\"Here lieth in St Michael's churchyard a man who had his dwelling three miles to the north.\\" As the sea is little more than half a mile away at this point, this suggests that the sea has made some considerable advance over the centuries. Outside the church is a penitential stone where sinners had to do penance by standing, dressed in white, by the stone and beseech the congregation for mercy as they entered and left the church. The 1868 Abergele rail disaster was, at that time, the worst railway disaster in Britain. The 33 people who died are buried in a mass grave in the local churchyard. Abergele Sanitorium was built just outside Abergele in 1910; it became a community hospital in the 1980s. On 30 June 1969, the evening before the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in Caernarfon, two members of Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (Welsh Defence Movement), Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, were killed when the bomb they were planting outside government offices exploded prematurely. Tower on Tower Hill, Abergele Ethnography Recent genetic studies as part of the Genetic history of Europe on the Y chromosomes of men in Abergele have revealed that there is a significant percentage of E1b1b1a2 haplogroup in Abergele. Membership in Y chromosome haplogroup E1b1b1a2 (E-V13) was found to average at 38.97% in a small sample of 18 male y-chromosomes in Abergele. This genetic marker is found at its highest concentrations in the Balkans at over 40% in areas, but at much lower percentages in Northern Europe at less than 5%. The reason for notably higher levels of E1b1b in Abergele is most likely the heavy presence of the Roman Army in Abergele as most of the soldiers that came to Britain did not come from Italy, but from other parts of the Roman Empire. Other notable levels of genetic marker E-V13 have been found in a few other towns in Britain that were known to have had a heavy Roman presence nearly 2000 years ago.

It was historically a centre for framework knitting and then for mining, but is now a focus for other industries and a dormitory town for Nottingham. It was the site where Rolls-Royce made the first demonstration of a vertical take-off plane. It is also the final resting place of Lord Byron in 1824 and of his estranged daughter, the mathematician and pioneer computer programmer Ada Lovelace in 1852. Geography Hucknall is north-west of Nottingham, on the west bank of the Leen Valley, on land which rises from the Trent Valley in the south to the hills of the county north of Kirkby-in-Ashfield. The Whyburn or Town Brook flows through the town centre. Farleys Brook marks its southern boundary. The town's highest point is Long Hill, at above sea level, with views over the city and Trent Valley, which descends to 22‚Äì24 metres (72‚Äì79 ft) AOD, flowing just beyond most of the city centre. Ordnance survey website The town is surrounded by farmland or parkland. To the north-west lie Misk Hills and Annesley. To the north-east of the town are the villages of Linby and Papplewick, and beyond these two, Newstead Abbey and its grounds, once the residence of Lord Byron. To the west lies Eastwood, birthplace of D. H. Lawrence and an inspiration for many of his novels and short stories. To the east of the town is Bestwood Country Park. The contiguous settlements of Butler's Hill and Westville often appear as distinct entities on maps, but are generally seen as parts of Hucknall. They belong to its historic and present-day Church of England parish, although the town itself has no civil parish council. The identity is reinforced by being part of the post town and by being shared wards of Hucknall. History Hucknall was once a thriving market town. Its focal point is the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene, next to the town's market square. The church was built by the Anglo-Saxons and completed after the Norman Conquest, though its medieval chancel, nave, north aisle and tower were much restored and enlarged in the Victorian period. In 1872 a south aisle was added and in 1887 unusually long transepts, while the rest of the building apart from the tower was thoroughly restored. The top tower stage and the south porch are 14th-century. There are 25 stained-glass windows by Charles Eamer Kempe, installed mostly in the 1880s, and a modest memorial to Lord Byron.Pevsner, N. (1951) Nottinghamshire. Harmondsworth: Penguin; pp. 85‚Äì86. From 1295 until 1915, the town was known as Hucknall Torkard, taken from Torcard, the name of a dominant landowning family. Signs of the earlier name can be seen on some older buildings. During the 19th and 20th centuries, coal was discovered and mined heavily throughout the Leen Valley, which includes Hucknall. This brought increased wealth to the town and construction of three railway lines. The first was the Midland Railway (later part of the LMS) line from Nottingham to Mansfield and Worksop, closed to passengers on 12 October 1964 though partly retained as a freight route serving collieries at Hucknall, Linby and Annesley. The Hucknall station on this line was known as Hucknall Byron in its latter years. In the 1990s the line was reopened to passengers in stages as the Robin Hood Line, the section through Hucknall in 1993, with a new station on the site of the old \\"Byron\\", though simply called Hucknall. The second was the Great Northern Railway (later part of the LNER) route up the Leen Valley and on to Shirebrook, serving many of the same places as the Midland south of Annesley. It closed to passengers on 14 September 1931, but remained in freight use until 25 March 1968. The station on this line was known as Hucknall Town. The third was the Great Central Railway (also later part of the LNER), the last main line built from the north of England to London, opened on 15 March 1899. The stretch through Hucknall closed fully on 5 September 1966, but Hucknall Central station had closed earlier, on 4 March 1963. From 1894 until 1974 Hucknall was the seat of Hucknall Urban District Council. With the abolition of the UDC, local government was transferred to Ashfield. In 1956 the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Hucknall was built to serve western parts of Hucknall. Toponomy Hucknall was recorded as Hokeuhale (n.d.) and Hokenale (n.d.), suggesting ‚Äúnook of land of H≈çcanere‚Äù (a tribe), from Old English halh (haugh). This same tribe's name occurs in Hook Norton, Oxfordshire. It has been suggested that the name Hucknall once referred to a larger area on the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire border. Two other settlements in the locality are called Hucknall; Hucknall-under-Huthwaite, in Nottinghamshire, (known today as Huthwaite) and Ault Hucknall in Derbyshire. It is likely that Hucknall Torkard marked the southern boundary of this larger Hucknall Area.huthwaite-online In the Domesday Book (AD 1086) the name appears as Hochenale (volume 1, pp. 288‚Äì290). Heritage The Hucknall Tourism and Regeneration Group (http://www.htrg.co.uk/) has a mission statement: \\"To help Hucknall regain its position as a strong, viable and prosperous town. To retain the historical legacy of the town and surrounding area. To attract visitors and boost the local economy by raising awareness of our heritage to both visitors and residents alike.\\" The Hucknall Tourism and Regeneration Group (HTRG) was inaugurated in 2002. It consists of people from all aspects of Hucknall life, who have a desire to help regenerate the town, primarily through tourism, after the devastating loss of the mining industry and large portions of the textile industry. Members of the group include residents, business owners, volunteer workers and councillors. HTRG works with other well-established organisations such as the Hucknall Round Table, the Rotary Club of Hucknall, Hucknall Heritage Society, the Eric Coates Society, St Mary Magdalene Church, Ashfield District Council Nottinghamshire County Council, Hucknall Library and volunteer organisations, to prevent duplication of work and ensure the town is working together. The group seeks opportunities to promote the town through radio interviews, newspaper coverage, street exhibitions, events, leaflets and posters. Heritage trails have been designed, one for the town centre and a 20-mile (32 km) circular trail. To complement these trails, leaflets have been produced and free guided walks/bus tours take place throughout the spring and summer months. The town centre was pedestrianised in 2017, and an inner relief road opened from Annesley Road through to Station Street. Transport The town is the northern terminus for the Nottingham Express Transit tram system and has a station on the Robin Hood Line. There is also a tram stop at Butler's Hill/Broomhill. The town used to be on the A611, but this now bypasses it to the west with a single-carriageway road with roundabouts and access to junction 27 of the M1, some 3 miles (5 km) away. The tram line was built in 2002‚Äì2004 and currently runs from Hucknall to the Toton Lane terminus. Since 2015, Nottingham Express Transit operations moved their stop at Nottingham Station, with trams now passing through to Clifton South and Toton Lane. Hucknall was previously served by the Great Central Main Line with a station. It closed in 1963 and the line in 1967. The site is now occupied by housing and a doctors surgery. Education The National Academy was founded in 1788 by Frederick Ward and originally located at the southern end of Annesley Road.Hucknall Torkard History It relocated in the 1970s to a new build still on Annesley Road but at the north end of the town, near the roundabout of the B6011 road.National School Technology College The National School has a large science block with 10 labs and an astro-turf playing area, both opened in 2004 by Princess Anne.

Industry Bronze statue commemorating the lost mining industry, to be seen near Hucknall tram and railway station. The main figure is on top of a Davy lamp, whilst another collier is depicted hewing coal inside the lamp glass. =Mining= Hucknall was a colliery town from 1861 to 1986. The sinking of the mines caused Hucknall to grow into a market town in under a century. The Hucknall Colliery Company, formed in 1861, sank two shafts, Hucknall No. 1 colliery (Top Pit) in 1861 off Watnall Road (closed 1943), and Hucknall No. 2 colliery (Bottom Pit) in 1866 off Portland Road (closed 1986). =Rolls-Royce= Hucknall Airfield, built in 1916, became RAF Hucknall. From 1927, Rolls-Royce began using the airfield for flight tests. During World War II, the aerodrome at Hucknall launched the first flight of a P-51 Mustang fitted with a Rolls-Royce Merlin Engine. The Merlin, replacing the earlier Allison V-1710 engine, allowed the Mustang air frame to reach its full potential and achieve spectacular high- altitude performance. In the early 1950s, the Rolls-Royce site at Hucknall developed the world's first vertical-takeoff jet aircraft ‚Äì actually a test rig, officially called the Thrust Measuring Rig, but soon nicknamed the Flying Bedstead because of its shape. The first untethered flight, piloted by Capt. Ron Shepherd, took place on 3 August 1954 before a distinguished audience. The rig rose slowly into the air and hovered steadily. It moved forward, made a circuit of the area, then demonstrated sideways and backwards movements, before making a successful landing. The flight was followed over the next four months by a number of free flights up to a height of 50 ft. There were pubs in Hucknall called The Flying Bedstead and The Harrier. Rolls-Royce's flight test centre closed in 1971, but engines were tested there until late 2008. Some components are still manufactured at the site. In December 1940, during World War II, a German prisoner-of-war, Franz von Werra, attempted to escape by posing as a Dutch pilot and flying off in a Hurricane fighter. He was arrested at gunpoint as he sat in the cockpit trying to learn the controls, and returned to his camp in Swanwick, Derbyshire. Franz von Werra was eventually the only German PoW to succeed in returning to Germany, when he escaped from Canada to the United States, then to Mexico and into South America, over a period from January to April 1941. His exploits feature in the film The One That Got Away. =Textiles= Framework knitting was once the predominant industry in Hucknall. =Garden products= Among the bigger firms in Hucknall is Doff Portland, one of the UK's largest independent maker of insecticides, weedkillers, pesticides, fertilisers and garden products, sold through garden centres, DIY retailers and retail multiples, and one of Europe's largest producer of premium slug killer pellets. It also offers contract formulating and packing services.Doff site.

Brass band The Hucknall and Linby Mining Community Brass Band formed in late 2008 after players from the Newstead Abbey Brass Band sought autonomy. It is conducted by Paul Whyley. At the time, the town lacked a band after Hucknall and Linby Miners' Welfare Band moved out to become Newstead Brass. It plays a parish-church concert every Christmas, and around the local area throughout the year. Cinema The Byron Cinema, an Art Deco building designed by the local architect Alfred J Thraves, opened on 2 November 1936. It originally boasted a sweeping, curved fa√ßade of Thraves' favoured sandstock bricks and Portland stone, with a vertical tower to the right of centre, faced in cream terracotta tiles. Much was also made in the cinema's publicity of a canopy \\"provided to protect our patrons during bad weather.\\" The Hucknall Dispatch newspaper was enthusiastic about the 1,189-seater facility: \\"The consensus of opinion was that it's a delightful house of rest and amusement, the seating being conducive to the utmost comfort, whilst the projection was without fault for the first time, so perfect has the art become in these days.\\" Manager R. L. Kemp told the paper, \\"The Byron projection room fills us with great pride and the management cordially invite any of our patrons who so desire to view the projection room. 'Wide Range' is the latest improvement developed by Western Electric engineers. It will be remembered that Western Electric were the pioneers of talking pictures and Wide Range is their latest scientific achievement.\\" On 13 October 1967, the Byron closed as a single-screen cinema and the building was split. The stalls area was turned into a bingo club that featured in the Shane Meadows film \\"Once Upon A Time In The Midlands\\", wherein Kathy Burke and Vanessa Feltz came to blows in the foyer. The upstairs balcony became a 404-seat cinema, which re-opened on 31 December 1967 with the James Bond epic \\"You Only Live Twice\\". It finally closed its doors in June 2006 and was bought in October 2018 by an Irish commercial property firm, Melcorpo, for a price believed to be ¬£360,000. The new owners reopened to the public as The Arc Cinema Hucknall. After initially planning to open its doors in October 2019, Melcorpo had to scrap the plans due to delays. Construction and refurbishment were still underway in January 2020. It was scheduled to open in March 2020 as a four-screen, two-floor multiplex cinema.

He was the New York Philharmonic's composer-in-residence from 2009 to 2012 and has been the London Philharmonic Orchestra's composer- in-residence since the beginning of the 2014‚Äì15 season. Early life Lindberg was born in Helsinki, where he studied at the Sibelius Academy under Einojuhani Rautavaara and Paavo Heininen, beginning with piano. He attended summer courses in Siena (with Franco Donatoni) and Darmstadt (with Brian Ferneyhough). After graduating in 1981, he traveled widely in Europe, attending private studies with Vinko Globokar and G√©rard Grisey in Paris, and observing Japanese drumming and punk rock in Berlin. Compositions and style Lindberg's juvenilia include the large orchestral work Donor, composed at age 16. Quintetto dell‚ÄôEstate (1979) is generally held to be Lindberg's first opus. His first piece performed by a professional orchestra was Sculpture II in 1982, the second part of a trilogy whose first and third sections were long unwritten. His first great success came with \\"Action- Situation-Signification\\" (1982), the first work in which he explored musique concr√®te. This piece was written for and premiered by the new-music ensemble Toimii (\\"It Works\\" in Finnish), which Lindberg founded in the summer of 1980. Around the same period, Lindberg founded an informal grouping known as the Ears Open Society including Lindberg and his contemporaries Eero H√§meenniemi, Jouni Kaipainen, Kaija Saariaho, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Herman Rechberger. He is a trained pianist and has performed several of his works as part of Toimii. Kraft (1983‚Äì85), another piece written for Toimii, is Lindberg's largest work to date, with harmonies of over 70 notes and a meter-high score. It uses traditional instrumentation as well as percussion on scrap metal and spoken word. After finishing it Lindberg found it hard to compose, and with the exception of 1986's Ur, which he called \\"Kraft in chamber form\\", he entered a creative hiatus that lasted over two years. During this time he was not only rethinking his style but also recovering from a tropical disease contracted during travel in Indonesia. Kraft made use of a chaconne-type structure where the progression of the piece is based on a repeated chain of chords. It was this idea that served as the basis for Lindberg's next style. He returned with an orchestral trilogy consisting of Kinetics (1988), Marea (1989‚Äì90), and Joy (1990). Though Lindberg became less interested in electronic manipulation of sound, he continued to explore the possibilities of compositional software, and Engine displays complex computer-generated counterpoint. Since Joy, Lindberg has gradually refined his style, orchestrations and harmonies. This showed itself first in Corrente for chamber ensemble (1992) and its subsequent orchestral version, Corrente II, and in Duo Concertante (1992). In these works Lindberg showed influences ranging from Pierre Boulez and Tristan Murail to Igor Stravinsky and minimalism. His symphonic work Aura (1994) reflects a newer, more eclectic style. Lindberg has since built upon these developments, further refining his style, which now leans toward a type of new tonality hinted at in works such as Joy and Aura. This development has culminated in one of his most popular scores to date, his Clarinet Concerto (2002), which has a folk-like melody and rich orchestration. His recent work, Two Episodes, was premiered at the BBC Proms on 24 July 2016. It is a companion piece to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, containing allusions to both the symphony and other works by the composer, rather in the same way that I.M. Pei's Louvre Pyramid complements the Tuileries Palace in Paris.Martin Anderson, Programme, BBC Proms 2016 Prom 13, Sunday 24 July 2016 Awards and honors Lindberg has received a number of composition prizes, including the Prix Italia (1986), the UNESCO International Rostrum of Composers (1986), the Nordic Council Music Prize (1988) for Kraft, and the Royal Philharmonic Society Prize for large- scale composition (1992). Lindberg became the new composer-in-residence at the New York Philharmonic for the 2009‚Äì2010 season at the invitation of the incoming music director Alan Gilbert. The Philharmonic's September 2009 opening night gala, which was Gilbert's debut as music director, featured a well-received new work by Lindberg, EXPO. Lindberg's fourth and final commission as composer-in-residence was the Piano Concerto No. 2, which was premiered on May 3, 2012.

It is situated to the north- east of Nottingham's city boundary. Arnold's town centre is the largest in the Borough of Gedling and the most important in the northeastern part of the Greater Nottingham conurbation. Gedling Borough Council is headquartered in Arnold. Since 1968 Arnold has had a market, and the town used to have numerous factories associated with the hosiery industry. Nottinghamshire Police have been headquartered in Arnold since 1979. At the time of the 2011 census, Arnold had a population of 37,768. Areas within Arnold include Daybrook, Woodthorpe, Redhill, Warren Hill, Killisick and Dorket Head. Toponymy Arnold was referred to as \\"Ernehale\\" in Domesday Book of 1086. This name meant 'place frequented by eagles' or 'the valley of eagles'. A History of Arnold (1913) by Rev. Rupert W. King and Rev. James Russell explains the toponymy of Arnold's name thus: > \\"Heron-hald\\", meaning the corner of the forest where Herons (large birds) > live. Which becomes over the centuries since 500 A.D. by \\"lazy\\" > pronunciation, Eron-ald, thence Ern-old and Arn-old. The local topography suggests that Arnold can never have been a haunt of eagles, because they inhabit areas of rocky outcrops, which have formed cliffs: the nearest such location is Creswell Crags, some north-west as the eagle flies. However, the fish-eating white-tailed eagle (also known as the erne) could have caught fish in the River Trent, which lies south-east of Arnold, on the other side of the Mapperley Plains ridge: these eagles might then have flown north-west in the evenings to roost in the ancient woodland area now known as Arnold. The Anglo-Saxon migrant-invaders, when they arrived along the River Trent from the Humber Estuary , might have seen these eagles‚Äîwhich measure in length with a wingspan‚Äîflying northwest in the evenings and named this roosting location 'Erne-Halh' or 'Erne-Haugh', meaning 'eagle's nook' or 'eagle's corner'. Arnold is surrounded by a circular ridge from the north-west around to the south-east and raised ground to the west. The town's bowl-like topography may have given it the toponymic feature '-halh' or '-haugh'. History The Home Brewery office building, Daybrook =Home Brewery= Founded in 1875 by John Robinson, the Home Brewery was famous for its trademark Robin Hood logo on beermats. The name of the brewery referred to the Robinson family's Bestwood Home Farm, located on Oxclose Lane. 29 August 1890 saw the incorporation at Companies House of the Home Brewery Company Limited. The company was re-registered as a public limited company named Home Brewery plc on 2 April 1982. The brewery remained independent until 1986, when the family owners sold it (along with 450 pubs the brewery owned in Nottinghamshire) to Scottish & Newcastle for ¬£123 million (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Scottish & Newcastle gradually ran down production by subcontracting its brewing to Mansfield Brewery, resulting in the eventual closure of the Daybrook building in 1996. The closure of the brewery resulted in the loss of around 400 jobs and around ¬£20 million to the local economy (equivalent to ¬£ in ). On 7 April 2014 the company returned to its original legal status as a private company upon its incorporation as Home Brewery Limited. The company is currently still under the ownership of Heineken UK, with an active but non- trading status at Companies House. Building The town's most notable landmark is probably the Home Brewery office building in Daybrook. Dating from 1936, the current building is now officially known as 'Sir John Robinson House', houses more than of Nottinghamshire County Council offices and has a total floor area of . The entire site, including its 180-space car park, covers and is located at the junction between the A60 (Mansfield Road) and Sir John Robinson Way. The three-storey, Grade II listed building's architect was Thomas Cecil Howitt and the illuminated 'Home of the Best Ales' sign on the tower was altered to replace the word 'Ales' with the 'n' logo of the county council. An unusual frieze by sculptor Charles Doman along the front wall depicts groups of putti involved in the brewing of beer. Three designs are repeated in an ABCABC/CBACBA pattern. The reliefs are in a 2:3 proportion and are white casts. 'A' depicts a drinking table; 'B' shows barrel-making; and 'C' illustrates the stirring of the brew‚Äîall allegories of the brewing process. The famed decorative ironwork gates and railings are contemporaneous and form part of the historic listing. King George V Park In 1950, the Home Brewery Company Ltd. gave the land for Arnold's King George V Park, a permanent memorial to King George V and guaranteed for free public access in perpetuity for recreation. The Charity Commission held an enquiry that closed in December 2005 into restricted public access.Charities Commission Enquiry: King George V Playing Field Arnold - Registered Charity No 700035 Due to this ruling, Arnold Town F.C. have relocated away from the town centre to another ground in Arnold, known as Eagle Valley. In July 2014, a skatepark costing ¬£110,000 was opened at the playing field. The Home Ales and Home Brewery brands today The 'Robin Hood and Little John' pub The Home Ales brand that once was part of the Home Brewery Co., Ltd. was revived in 2015 by entrepreneur Nick Whitehurst (who used to live in Daybrook near the brewery) after he had acquired a licence from Heineken International. The beers are produced by Oldershaw Brewery, which is located in the village of Barkston near Grantham in Lincolnshire. Lincoln Green Brewery of Hucknall, in association with Everards Brewery of Leicester, purchased the Robin Hood pub on the junction of Church Street and Cross Street in 2014, restoring it to its original name of the \\"Robin Hood and Little John\\". The pub's history dates back to 1750, and in 2015 it was named as the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) National Cider Pub of the Year, as well as the Nottingham CAMRA Cider Pub of the Year and Nottingham CAMRA Pub of the Year. It contains a shrine to the Home Brewery. =Framework knitting industry= Arnold was a centre of the framework knitting industry in the 19th century. It was the site of the first framebreaking incidents of the Luddite riots, on 11 March 1811, when 63 frames were smashed. The Luddite riots were a response by workers to decreasing pay, standard of living and conditions of employment in the industry as a result of changing fashions decreasing demand for their style of hosiery. =Arnot Hill Park= Arnot Hill Park was created in to serve as a backdrop to Arnot Hill House. Arnot Hill House Arnot Hill House and grounds Arnot Hill House in Daybrook was the home of the Hawksleys, a prominent Nottingham family. John Hawksley (1765-1815), a mill owner, lived there with his partner Sarah Thompson, who was the mother of his six children, four of whom survived. He had married Sarah Arnold, a doctor's daughter, on 23 February 1799 at St Margaret's Church in Leicester, but the marriage failed and she returned to Leicester where she remained until her death in 1846.Leicester Chronicle. Saturday 20 June 1846. (British Newspaper Archive) John Hawksley's relationship with Sarah Thompson is clearly demonstrated in his will dated 5 June 1812 when he writes. \\"I revoke all former wills and this is my last. I give and devise all my property of whatever nature or form the same may be to Mrs Beech and Sarah Thompson whom I appoint joint Executrixes of this my will for the benefit of my children John, Thomas, Francis, Maria, Frances, issue that are and any that may thereafter be born also of the body of Sarah Thompson (who assumes my name from the affection I bear her)\\". The will was proved on 2 April 1816 by the oaths of Sarah Beech widow (John Hawksley's sister) and Sarah Thompson spinster. Photograph of Thomas Hawksley John Hawksley and his business partner, the former hosier Robert Davison, had been operating a worsted mill they had built in 1788 on the north bank of the River Leen in Nottingham. After this mill had been destroyed by fire in January 1791, the two men decided to erect a new mill adjacent to Arnot Hill House. The new factory was operational before the end of 1791, but ‚Äì despite its large scale and engine ‚Äì was not a success. Davison's death in 1807, followed by extensive losses in 1809, led to the closure and subsequent demolition of the mill. On 5 February 1810 in Nottingham, John Hawksley laid the foundations of another mill, whose engine had a power of , and he relocated with his family to Sneinton that year. He died on 27 January 1815 in Cheshunt in Hertfordshire and he appears on the family plaque in St Nicholas Church on Maid Marian Way, Nottingham. One of John Hawksley and Sarah Thompson's children was Thomas Hawksley, born 12 July 1807, who attended Nottingham High School and was articled in 1822 by the architect and surveyor Edward Staveley, going on to become a partner in Staveley's business. Thomas Hawksley eventually became a prominent civil engineer in the 19th century. Thomas Hawksley and his son Charles Hawksley, grandson Kenneth Phipson Hawksley, and great grandson, Thomas Edwin Hawksley (died 1972) were civil engineers specialising in public water supplies. Thomas Hawksley addressed the problem of endemic cholera in Nottingham by introducing a gravity-fed pressurised water system, and the use of filtration beds. This reduced the annual cholera death that had reached 289 in 1832 to 13. There is a common misconception that John Hawksley the manufacturer married Mary Whittle. This is a mistake; there is a marriage between a John Hawksley and Mary Whittle on 25 October 1803 but he was a barber/hairdresser. It was in 1803 that Sarah Thompson gave birth to Maria Hawksley on 19 March. John the manufacturer died in 1815 and John the barber was still alive living with Mary a fact recorded in the 1841 and 1851 censuses. The mistake is rooted in an erroneous family tree produced in 1896 by Ida Hawksley, the wife of Charles Hawksley. The details of Ida's tree were made available by a living descendant of the Hawksley family and the corrections detailed above, including the differences in generation, are based on parish records, John Hawksley's will and the Hawksley family plaque in St Nicholas' Church in Nottingham.Details from a living descendant of the Hawksley family This confusion regarding the two men named John Hawksley living in Nottingham is added to by the birth of sons to both men, in the same year, 1807. John Hawksley, the hairdresser, had a son named Edward John Hawskley (1808-1875). The son was a Unitarian who converted to Roman Catholicism and later rose to acclaim as a political radical in New South Wales, Australia. After fighting in Spain with the British Auxiliary Legion in the Carlist Wars, Edward John Hawksley was encouraged to emigrate to New South Wales. Once there he was employed as a teacher, became warden of the Sydney Holy Catholic Guild (1848), and wrote religious pamphlets. He edited and published The Sydney Chronicle (1846-7) and the short-lived Daily News with Charles St Julian before working with Francis Cunninghame as editor of The People's Advocate and New South Wales Vindicator. From 1863‚Äì70 Hawksley was employed at the Australian Government Printing Office before retiring to Fiji, where he died in 1875. Civic Centre The headquarters of Gedling Borough Council are located in the Civic Centre at Arnot Hill Park. =Railway= Postcard of Daybrook railway station, 1908 Arnold was served by a railway station known as 'Daybrook and Arnold' or simply 'Daybrook'. The station was an important junction on the Nottingham Suburban Railway, Leen Valley Line and Friar Gate Line. It was closed along with the rest of the lines between 1916 and 1964. The station was located on Mansfield Road (A60) on what is now a retail park. There is still evidence of the line in the form of remnants of the embankments on Arnot Hill Park (just behind GO Outdoors). In Peggy's Park (next to Edwards Lane Community Centre), decorative markings commemorate the existence of the line by showing the place where it ran. The nearest active railway station to Arnold is now in Bulwell. With the nearest tram stop being in Basford. The line was the Great Northern Main Line (later nicknamed 'the back route'), with trains to Gedling and Netherfield with the terminus being Nottingham Victoria. Just after those embankments a later built railway‚Äîthe Nottingham Suburban Railway‚Äîjoined it and ran over Thackerays Lane on a bridge on its way to Woodthorpe Park and beyond. Churches Roman Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd, Thackerays Lane ;Arnold St Mary's Church, of the Church of England, is believed to date from 1176. It is located on Church Lane and is a Grade II* listed building. The Grade II* listed Roman Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd's current building on Thackerays Lane was built in 1964, its modern architecture ‚Äì featuring a detached spire-cum-belfry ‚Äì winning an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1966. The King's Church, formed in 1987 as Kingswell Christian Fellowship by attendants of Cornerstone Church, meets at The King's Centre, which is located on Shirley Drive. Originally, the congregation met in a local school and then a day centre for adults with learning disabilities. The church changed its name to The King's Church in 1996. The church purchased, refurbished and extended the former St. Gilbert's Catholic Church building, and the King's Church moved into The King's Centre in 2002. Arnold Methodist Church Church of St Paul and St Timothy, Daybrook Designed by Nottingham-based architect William Herbert Higginbottom, Cross Street Baptist Church was opened in 1909, replacing a previous building ‚Äì dating from 1825 ‚Äì on the same site. It is situated on Cross Street, hence its name. St Mark's Church in Woodthorpe belongs to the Church of England and consists of around 8,500 parishioners. It was built in 1961 and consecrated in June 1962. It is located on De Vere Gardens.

In December 1895 the church was completed‚Äîexcept for the -tall spire and tower, which were added in 1897. The church was originally consecrated in February 1896 in honour of Paul the Apostle, but in 1993 it was re-dedicated as St. Paul's and St. Timothy's when the latter, a daughter church, was opened in Byron Street to replace Cecil Hall (which had long been used as an annexe of St Paul's). The Church of St. Paul and St. Timothy is now a Grade II* listed building and is located on Mansfield Road. Daybrook Baptist Church is situated on Mansfield Road. Its current building, completed in 1912, was designed by William Herbert Higginbottom. Shopping Arnold town centre has a diverse range of restaurants and bars and a choice of shops including supermarkets such as Asda, Sainsbury's and Iceland as well as small independent businesses. There are Aldi and Lidl supermarkets in Daybrook. =Market= 1968 saw the opening of Arnold Market in the town centre. Market days are on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, with a flea market being held on Wednesdays. A farmers' market is held on the first Tuesday of each month. It was a private market managed by Janet Surgey (whose deputy was Nigel Wilford) until July 2018, when Gedling Borough Council purchased it from Thurland Estates Ltd. Recreation Arnold Library Arnold Leisure Centre, located on High Street at the heart of the town centre, contains a swimming pool and a theatre‚Äîcalled the Bonington Theatre‚Äîwhich was named after the landscape painter Richard Parkes Bonington.

Healthcare Stenhouse Medical Centre is located on Furlong Street. The practice's first doctor was Dr Daniel Stenhouse, who in 1886 became a general practitioner in Arnold and practised until 1897 from Ebenezer House, which was the old farmhouse at the bottom of Worrall Avenue. Following this, Dr Stenhouse moved to live and practise from Arnold House on Church Street until his death in 1916. Before Drs Graham, Jacobs and Lobb formed a partnership due to the expansion of the practice in the 1950s, there had been a succession of independent GPs. The practice remained at Arnold House until 1970, when it moved into Arnold Health Centre. In April 1991 the practice moved into its current building on Furlong Street, on the site of what was called 'The Flying Horse Yard'. The practice now has six partners and 12,000 patients.

Among the many comic-book series for which he wrote was DC's Omega Men for a run in the 1980s. Slifer was the victim of a hit-and-run accident in 2012 that left him in institutional care until his death. Biography Slifer was born on November 11, 1954. He had a sister, Connie. Slifer spent most of his childhood in Morristown, Indiana. = Comics = Slifer started out in comics as a member of the so-called CPL Gang, a group of amateur comics enthusiasts based in Indianapolis, many of whom later went on to careers in the comics industry. By the mid‚Äì1970s, Slifer was working as a freelance writer for Marvel Comics. Thanks to Marvel staffers (and former CPL Gang members) Duffy Vohland and Tony Isabella, in the late 1970s Slifer was hired as an assistant editor at Marvel, where wrote for a number of comic-book series including The Defenders. Eventually, Slifer became a special projects editor at Marvel, overseeing comics magazines published by Marvel's parent company such as The Rampaging Hulk. During this time, Slifer worked on the Marvel Classics Comics line, in addition to film adaptations. Slifer moved to DC Comics in February 1981, ostensibly as the company's first sales manager to comic book specialty stores. He continued writing sporadically, most notably on Omega Men, where he co-created the extraterrestrial alien mercenary anti-hero Lobo with artist Keith Giffen. Slifer served as an editor at DC from 1984‚Äì1985 and oversaw the Green Lantern/Green Arrow reprint series, New Talent Showcase, and World's Finest Comics. Slifer left DC after clashing with the company about its stance regarding creators' rights.Slifer, Roger. \\"Screwed by DC,\\" The Comics Journal #121 (April 1988), p. 25.

Slifer eventually became a supervising producer, story editor, and writer for the animated television program Jem and the Holograms. He produced and was story editor on other animated series including G.I. Joe Extreme, My Little Pony 'n Friends, Transformers, Street Fighter, Conan the Adventurer, and Bucky O'Hare. During his time at Sunbow, Slifer's colleagues included former Marvel Comics writers Steve Gerber and Marv Wolfman. Slifer co-produced the first season of Yu-Gi-Oh! for 4Kids Entertainment in the United States. = Video games = Slifer worked as a writer and consultant in the video games industry.  Personal life  Prior to 2012, Slifer lived in Santa Monica, California. = Hit-and-run accident = Early on June 23, 2012, Slifer was hit by a car while walking in Santa Monica, California, after spending the evening with friends. The driver fled the scene. Slifer was seriously injured, suffering breaks to some ribs, his collar bone, and his shoulder. Most critically, due to head injuries, doctors had to remove a portion of Slifer's skull and place him in an induced coma at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.

Covering a total of 10 acres (4 ha) adjacent to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the buildings include: * Watergate West (2700 Virginia Avenue NW), cooperative apartments. * Watergate 600 (600 New Hampshire Ave NW), office building. * Watergate Hotel (2650 Virginia Avenue NW). * Watergate East (2500 Virginia Avenue NW), cooperative apartments. * Watergate South (700 New Hampshire Avenue NW), cooperative apartments. * Watergate Office Building (2600 Virginia Ave NW), the office building where the Watergate burglary happened. Built between 1963 and 1971, the Watergate was considered one of Washington's most desirable living spaces, popular with members of Congress and political appointees of the executive branch. The complex has been sold several times since the 1980s. During the 1990s, it was subdivided and its component buildings and parts of buildings were sold to various owners. In 1972, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, then located on the sixth floor of the Watergate Office Building, was burglarized; private campaign documents were photographed and telephones were wiretapped. The U.S. Senate investigation into the burglary revealed that high officials in the administration of President Richard Nixon had ordered the break-in and later tried to cover up their involvement. Additional crimes were also uncovered. The Watergate scandal, named after the complex, resulted in Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974. The name \\"Watergate\\" and the suffix \\"-gate\\" have since become synonymous with and applied by journalists to controversial topics and scandals in the United States and elsewhere, even extending to contexts where English is not a major language. Location Map of the Watergate complex, showing the former Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge across the street and the nearby Kennedy Center. The Watergate area is bounded on the north by Virginia Avenue, on the east by New Hampshire Avenue, on the south by F Street, and on the west by the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway which is along the Potomac River. It is in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood, next to the Kennedy Center and the embassy of Saudi Arabia. The nearest Metro station, 0.4 miles (650 m) away, is Foggy Bottom-GWU. =Site history= For more than a century, the land now occupied by the Watergate complex belonged to the Gas Works of the Washington Gas Light Company, which produced \\"manufactured gas\\" (a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other flammable and nonflammable gases) for heating, cooking, and lighting throughout the city.Penczer, Peter R.

Sterling, Va.: Capital Books, 2008. Gas production ceased at the site in 1947, and the plant was demolished shortly thereafter. During the 1950s, the World Bank considered building its international headquarters here and on the adjacent site (which now houses the Kennedy Center), but rejected the site for unspecified reasons. It constructed its headquarters at its current location at 1818 H Street NW in Washington, D.C.\\"World Bank History: The Bank's Headquarters Building.\\" International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.

The \\"Watergate West\\" building is in the background. The name \\"Watergate\\" relates to numerous aspects of its physical and historical context. The name \\"Watergate\\" and the suffix \\"-gate\\" have since become synonymous with and applied by journalists to controversial topics and scandals in the United States and elsewhere, in places that do not have English as the main language. The complex sits near the eastern terminus of the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal, which operated from 1831 to 1924 and is now a National Historical Park. The remains of the gravity dam across Rock Creek, as well as Waste Weir #1 are at this site. Land once owned by the canal company was part of the site purchased in 1960 by the project's developer, Rome-based Societ√† Generale Immobiliare (SGI). In his 2018 book The Watergate: Inside America‚Äôs Most Infamous Address, author Joseph Rodota gave three accounts of the origin of the name, based on sources inside the development team: Author and playwright Warren Adler, while working as a publicist for the developers, came up with the name; Nicolas Salgo, a New York financier who suggested the original site to Societa Generale Immobiliare, acquired the name from Marjory Hendricks, owner of the Water Gate Inn; and three local executives‚ÄîGiuseppe Cecchi, an employee of Societa Generale Immobiliare, Nicolas Salgo and Royce Ward‚Äîcame up with the name, inspired in part by the Water Gate Inn, and recommended it to executives in the Rome office for approval. According to Rodota, the earliest use of the name Watergate in the surviving files of Societa Generale Immobiliare is a June 8, 1961 memorandum authored by Giuseppe Cecchi, summarizing an early meeting with officials of the future John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts about the proposed project. In his 2009 book Presidential Power on Trial: From Watergate to All the President's Men, William Noble wrote that the Watergate \\"got its name from overlooking the 'gate' that regulated the flow of water from the Potomac River into the Tidal Basin at flood tide.\\" That gate (near the Jefferson Memorial) is about downriver from the Watergate complex. Another namesake, the \\"Water Gate Inn\\" restaurant (1942‚Äì1966), operated on the site for more than two decades before the Watergate complex was built. In 2004, Washington Post writer John Kelly argued that the name was most directly linked to the \\"Water Steps\\" or \\"Water Gate,\\" a set of ceremonial stairs west of the Lincoln Memorial that led down to the Potomac. The steps had been originally planned as a ceremonial gateway to the city and an official reception area for dignitaries arriving in Washington, D.C., via water taxi from Virginia, though they never served this function. Instead, beginning in 1935, a floating performance stage on the Potomac River was anchored to the base of the steps. It was the site for open-air concerts and the audience could sit on the stairs. Up to 12,000 people would sit on the steps and surrounding grass to listen to symphonies, military bands, and operas. The barge concerts ended in 1965 when jet airliner service began at National Airport and the noise impaired the venue's viability. The music venue was depicted in scenes in the motion pictures Houseboat (1958) and Born Yesterday (1950). History=The proposed complex= The Watergate complex was developed by the Italian firm SGI. The company purchased the that belonged to the defunct Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in February 1960 for $10 million. The project was announced on October 21, 1960. Luigi Moretti of the University of Rome was the chief architect, and Milton Fischer of the D.C.-based firm of Corning, Moore, Elmore and Fischer the associate architect. The apartment buildings included two-story units on the first and second floors, while the top-floor units had private rooftop terraces and fireplaces. The design for the entire complex also envisioned an electronic security system so extensive that the press claimed \\"intruders will have difficulty getting onto the grounds undetected.\\" Boris V. Timchenko, a noted D.C.-based landscape architect, supervised the design of the grounds, which included more than 150 planters, tiers of fountains designed to create sounds like a waterfall, landscaped rooftop terraces, swimming pools, and a park. Landscape features such as planters would also be used to create privacy barriers between apartments. The complex was the first mixed-use development in the District of Columbia,Sanchez, Carlos. \\"Watergate Blends Luxury, Convenience.\\" The Washington Post. March 23, 1991. and was intended to help define the area as a business and residential rather than industrial district. The Watergate complex was intended to be a \\"city within a city,\\" and provide so many amenities that residents would not need to leave. Among these were a 24-hour receptionist, room service provided by the Watergate Hotel, health club, restaurants, shopping mall, medical and dental offices, grocery, pharmacy, post office, and liquor store. At the time, it was also the largest renewal effort in the District of Columbia undertaken solely with private funds. Initially, the project was to cost $75 million and consist of six 16-story buildings comprising 1,400 apartment units, a 350-room hotel, office space, shops, 19 luxury \\"villas\\" (townhouses), and three-level underground parking for 1,250 vehicles. The Watergate's curved structures were designed to emulate two nearby elements. The first was the proposed Inner Loop Expressway, a curving freeway expected to be built just in front of the Watergate within the next decade. The second was the nearby Kennedy Center, then in the planning stage and whose original design was supposed to be curvilinear. Although the Kennedy Center later adopted a rectangular shape for cost reasons, the Watergate complex's design did not change. Incidentally, the curved structures would also give apartment dwellers an excellent view of the Potomac River. Because of the curves in the structure, the Watergate complex was one of the first major construction projects in the United States in which computers played a significant role in the design work. =Approval controversies= Because the District of Columbia is the seat of the United States government, proposals for buildings in the city (particularly those in the downtown area, near federal buildings and monuments) must pass through an extensive, complex, and time-consuming approval process. The approval process for the Watergate complex had five stages. The first stage considered the proposed project as a whole as well as the first proposed building. The remaining four stages considered the four remaining proposed buildings in turn. At each stage, three separate planning bodies were required to give their approval: The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), the District of Columbia Zoning Commission (DCZC), and the United States Commission of Fine Arts (USCFA) (which had approval authority over any buildings built on the Potomac River to ensure that they fit aesthetically with their surroundings). In December 1961, 14 months after the project was publicly announced, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) voiced its concern that the project's 16-story buildings would overshadow the Lincoln Memorial and the proposed \\"National Cultural Center\\" (later to be called the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts). At the time, the District of Columbia had a height limit on all buildings except for those located exclusively along business streets. To obtain a height waiver, SGI would have to include retail office space in the complex, but the site was then zoned only for apartment buildings. Thus, initial approval first had to be won from the District of Columbia Zoning Commission. By the time the DCZC met to consider approval in mid-April 1962, the cost of the project had been scaled back to $50 million. Because the District of Columbia lacked home rule, DCZC planners were reluctant to act without coordinating with agencies of the federal government. Additionally, many civic leaders, architects, business people, and city planners opposed the project before the DCZC because they feared it was too tall and too large. By the end of April, DCZC had announced that it would delay its decision. The Commission of Fine Arts also had concerns: it felt some of the land should be preserved as public space and objected to the height of the proposed buildings as well as their modern design. Three days after the DCZC meeting, the USCFA announced it was putting a \\"hold\\" on the Watergate development until its concerns were addressed. To counter this resistance, SGI officials met with members of the USCFA in New York City in April 1962 and defended the complex's design. SGI also reduced the planned height of the Watergate to 14 stories from 16. In May 1962, the NCPC reviewed the project. Additional revisions in the design plan pushed the cost back up to $65 million, even though only 17 villas were now planned. Based on this proposal, the NCPC approved the Watergate plan. With the support of the NCPC, SGI dug in its heels: It declared it was not interested in developing the unsightly, abandoned commercial site unless its basic curvilinear design (now called \\"Watergate Towne\\") was approved, and it lobbied DCZC commissioners in late May, lecturing them on the District's architectural heritage and the beauty of modern architecture. SGI officials also lobbied the USCFA. Meanwhile, White House staff made it known that the Kennedy administration wanted the height of the complex lowered to . Three key staff were opposed to the project on height grounds: Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Special Assistant to the President; August Heckscher III, Special Consultant on the Arts; and William Walton, a Kennedy family confidante. The three briefed President John F. Kennedy on the issue, but it was not clear who made the decision to request the height reduction or who made the request public. The White House announcement surprised many, and offended federal and city planners, who saw it as presidential interference in their activities. SGI's chief architect, G√°bor √Åcs, and Watergate chief architect Luigi Moretti flew to New York City on May 17 and defended the complex's design in a three- hour meeting with USCFA members. SGI agreed to shrink three of the planned buildings in the development to 13 stories (112 ft), with the remaining building rising to . SGI also agreed to add more open space by reducing the size of the Watergate to from and by reorienting or re-siting some of the buildings. The USCFA gave its assent to the revised construction plan on May 28, the White House withdrew its objections, and the DCZC gave its final approval on July 13. The final plan broke one building into two, creating five rather than four construction projects. Moretti later admitted he probably would have lowered the height of the buildings anyway, and thought that the approval process had gone relatively smoothly. Construction was expected to begin in spring 1963 and last five years. The Watergate project faced one final controversy. The group Protestants and Other Americans United for Separation of Church and State began a national letter-writing campaign opposing the project, alleging that the zoning waivers would not have been given had the Vatican not been a major investor in SGI. By mid-November 1962, more than 2,000 protest letters had been sent to Congress and another 1,500 to the White House. But the group's attempt to stop construction failed, and the project went forward. The project won its $44 million financial backing in late 1962, and its construction permits in May 1963. Construction began on the first building, the Watergate East apartment, in August 1963. The builder was Magazine Bros. Construction. Groundbreaking occurred in August 1963, and major excavation work was complete by May 1964. The U.S. Commission on Fine Arts attempted once more to revise the project. In October 1963, the USCFA alleged that the height of the Watergate complex, as measured from the parkway in front of it, would exceed the agreed-upon height restrictions. SGI officials, however, contended that architects are required by law to measure from the highest point on the property on which they are to build; using this measurement, the building met the May 1962 agreement stipulations. On January 10, 1963, SGI and the USCFA agreed that the height of the complex would not exceed above water level (10 inches below that of the nearby Lincoln Memorial), that fewer than 300 apartment units would be built (to reduce population congestion), and to eliminate the proposed luxury villas (to create more open space). Luxury penthouse apartments, however, could extend above the limit if they were set back from the edge of the building and the 14th floor was foregone. With these adjustments, the total cost of the first apartment complex (excluding plumbing, electricity, and decoration) was estimated at $12,184,376. =Construction= Construction proceeded. The foundation and basement of the first building, the Watergate East, were completed by September 1964, and the metal and concrete superstructure rose in October. In September 1964, the Watergate's developers signed a first-of-its-kind agreement under which the Washington Gas Light Co. would provide the entire complex with its heating and air conditioning.\\"Watergate, Gas Co. Sign Unusual Pact.\\" The Washington Post. September 9, 1964. The Watergate East was completed in May 1965, and a month later the first model apartment unit was opened to the public for viewing.\\"First Watergate Building Nearly Ready.\\" The Washington Post. May 22, 1965; \\"Watergate Apartment Model Opens.\\" The Washington Post. June 19, 1965. The building formally opened on October 23, 1965, and the first tenants moved in a few days later.\\"Formal Opening Wednesday For Watergate East.\\" The Washington Post. October 24, 1965; \\"Watergate East Gets First Tenants.\\" The Washington Post. October 24, 1965. Prices for the 238 cooperative apartment units ranged from $17,000 for efficiencies to more than $250,000 for penthouses, and were almost completely sold out by April 1967. The average apartment contained two bedrooms, two-and- a-half baths, a dining room, and a kitchen, and cost $60,000. Each parking space in the underground garage cost $3,000. The tenants took title to their building on April 8, 1966.\\"Watergate Operating As 'Co-Op'.\\" The Washington Post. April 9, 1966. In November, a Safeway supermarket, a Peoples Drug (now known as CVS pharmacy), beauty salon, barber shop, bank, bakery, liquor store, florist, dry cleaner, post office, upscale shops, and high-end restaurant took up residency in the retail space on the ground floor. Riverview Realty was the leasing agent for the complex. Construction began on the second building, the 11-story office building and hotel, in February 1965. Both opened on March 30, 1967; the Watergate Hotel welcomed its first guests the same day. The 12-story hotel initially included 213 rooms, while the 12-story office building, attached to the hotel by a colonnade, had of office space. The combined hotel/office building included a health club, space on the ground floor for shops, and a restaurant, the Roman Terrace, on the top floor. Later in April, the Democratic National Committee leased office space in the building's retail office portion. The third building in the complex, Watergate South, opened in June 1968. It contained 260 residential units, more than any other building in the complex. Construction on the fourth building in the complex, the Watergate West apartments, began in July 1967. Apartments in the unfinished building, priced from $30,000 to $140,000, began selling in October 1967, an indication of how popular the complex was with District residents. The Watergate West topped out on August 16, 1968, at which point the cost of the project had risen to $70 million. Construction was completed in 1969. =The 5th building= Controversy arose over the construction of the Watergate Office Building, the complex's fifth and final structure. Its original design called for a structure with the upper floors set back to create more space and light. But in June 1965, as excavation and clearing began for the Kennedy Center, its advocates began agitating to lower the planned height of the final Watergate building. The general counsel for the Kennedy Center told the USCFA that the Watergate Town (the development had dropped the \\"e\\") was planning a building that would harm the aesthetics of the Kennedy Center and intrude on its park- like surroundings. The Watergate's attorneys responded that their building would stay within the agreed-upon height. The disagreement continued for nearly two years, delaying the planned fall 1967 start to construction. Watergate apartment residents such as Senator Wayne Morse lobbied the USFCA, DCZC, and NCPC to force SGI to accede to the Kennedy Center's wishes. In November 1967, the USCFA reaffirmed its approval of the Watergate project. When the DCZC appeared on the verge of giving its approval as well, the Kennedy Center argued that the DCZC had no jurisdiction over the controversy. The DCZC disagreed, and re-asserted its jurisdiction. The Kennedy Center then argued that the DCZC had not properly considered its objections, and should delay its approval pending further hearings. The District's legal counsel disagreed, giving the DCZC the go-ahead to reaffirm (or not) its approval ruling, which the Zoning Commission did on November 30, 1967. Although it appeared that SGI was winning the legal battle over the fifth building, D.C. city planners attempted to mediate the dispute between the Kennedy Center and the Watergate and achieve a contractual rather than legal solution. Three separate proposals were made to both sides on December 7, 1967. On April 22, 1968, SGI agreed to turn its fifth building slightly to the southwest in order to open up the Watergate complex a little more and give the Kennedy Center a bit of open space. Although the Kennedy Center accepted the proposal, it demanded that the fifth building include apartment units, rather than be completely devoted to office space, to maintain the area's residential nature. The fight now moved to the NCPC. In June 1968, the NCPC held a hearing at which more than 150 Watergate apartment residents clashed with SGI officials over the nature of the final building. On August 8, 1968, SGI and the Kennedy Center reached a resolution, agreeing that only 25 percent of the fifth building's would be used as office space and that the remaining space would become apartment units. The NCPC approved the revised plan in November 1968, and the DCZC did so five weeks later, specifically zoning the building for nonprofit and professional use only. The fifth building was completed in January 1971. Its first tenant was the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which secured occupancy in February 1971, and its first major tenant was the Manpower Evaluation and Development Institute, which leased the entire eighth floor. In October 1972, several high-end fashion boutiques, jewelers, and a restaurant opened in a retail space named \\"Les Champs.\\" The total cost of the project was $78 million. =Critical reception= Characteristic architecture of the Watergate complex The Watergate's initial reception was poor, but the complex soon became recognized as one of D.C.'s finest examples of modern architecture. When models of the Watergate were unveiled in 1961, critics said the structure \\"would ruin the waterfront\\". Other critics denounced it as \\"nonconforming\\" and decried it as \\"Antipasto on the Potomac\\". As noted above, many individuals also felt the complex blocked views of the Potomac River, tended to overshadow nearby monuments and other buildings, and consumed too much open space. Some residents even felt the construction of the units was substandard. Architectural critics called the detailing \\"clunky\\". The Washington Star newspaper, however, was an early proponent of the Watergate. In May 1962, it editorialized: \\"It is true that the so-called 'curvilinear' design is at variance with most commercial architecture in Washington. But in our opinion the result, which places a premium on public open space and garden-like surroundings, and which proposes a quality of housing that would rank with the finest in the city, would be a distinct asset.\\" The curving design has continued to draw praise. A noted 2006 guidebook to the city's architecture concluded that the Watergate brought a \\"welcome fluidity\\" to the city's boxy look. Others praised the complex's internal public spaces. When the Watergate East opened in 1965, The Washington Post called these areas opulent and evocative of the best in Italian design. The New York Times characterized the design as \\"sweeping,\\" and complimented each building's spectacular views of the Potomac River, Virginia skyline, and monuments. Many residents later said the flowing lines reminded them of a graceful ship. =Watergate II= In 1970, as the Watergate was nearing completion, SGI proposed building a \\"Watergate II\\" apartment, hotel, and office complex on the waterfront in Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the original Watergate. Although the project initially received support from Alexandria city officials and business people, residents of the city's Old Town strongly objected. The project stalled for two years due to protests from residents and a land dispute regarding title to the waterfront land on which the project was to be sited. The Watergate II project was eventually abandoned in favor of a much larger complex near Landmark Mall in Alexandria (a site nowhere near water). Individual buildings at the Watergate The complex. The Kennedy Center is visible in the background. The boxy building at middle left is the former Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge, used during the 1972 Watergate burglaries to monitor the break-ins and wiretaps across the street. The entire Watergate complex was initially owned by Watergate Improvements, Inc., a division of SGI. In 1969, the Vatican sold its interest in SGI and no longer was part- owner of the Watergate.\\"Vatican May Sell Watergate Interest.\\" The Washington Post. June 19, 1969. Although the Watergate was considered one of the most glamorous residences in the city, as early as 1970 residents and businesses complained of substandard construction, including a leaking roof and poor plumbing and wiring. The three Watergate Apartment buildings total some 600 residential units. Among the many notable past occupants are the following: Alfred S. Bloomingdale, Anna Chennault, Bob and Elizabeth Dole (Watergate South),Bernstein, Carl and Woodward, Bob. All The President's Men. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1994. Pl√°cido Domingo, Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Watergate South), Alan Greenspan, Monica Lewinsky (she stayed briefly at her mother's apartment in the complex), Senator Russell Long, Clare Boothe Luce (after 1983), Robert McNamara, John and Martha Mitchell, Paul O'Neill, Condoleezza Rice, Mstislav Rostropovich, Maurice Stans, Ben Stein, Herbert Stein, John Warner and Elizabeth Taylor (during their marriage), Caspar Weinberger, Charles Z. Wick, and Rose Mary Woods. The Watergate's popularity among members of Congress and high-ranking executive branch political appointees has remained strong ever since the complex opened. So many members of the Nixon administration settled there that the Washington, D.C., press commented on it and nicknamed it the \\"Republican Bastille\\". The complex enjoyed a renaissance during the early 1980s and became known as the \\"White House West\\" due to the large number of Reagan administration officials living there. The Watergate complex changed hands in the 1970s, and each building was sold off separately in the 1990s and 2000s (decade) (see below). Strict lease agreements, however, have kept the apartment buildings in residents' hands: In the Watergate South, for example, owners cannot rent their unit until a full year has passed, and no lease may last more than two years. In 1977, one of the Watergate's financiers (Nicholas Salgo) and Continental Illinois Properties bought SGI's stake in the development for $49 million. Two years later, Continental Illinois sold its interest to the National Coal Board Pension Fund in the U.K. Salgo did the same in 1986. The coal board pension fund put the Watergate complex up for sale in 1989, and estimated the complex's worth at between $70 million and $100 million. Several buildings were sold in the 1990s (for details, see below). The property was valued at $278 million in 1991. Efficiency units in that year sold for $95,000, while penthouse apartments went for $1 million or more. Various buildings were sold again in the early 2000s (decade). In 2005, all of the retail space in the complex was put up for sale. Little redevelopment of the site has occurred in the 40 years since the Watergate was first built. The complex still includes three luxury apartment buildings, the hotel/office building, and two office buildings. The entire development was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 21, 2005. =Watergate East= The Watergate East apartment building is probably the second-best known of the five buildings in the development. It became the most sought-after living location in the city when it opened in 1966. Problems with the building's construction became apparent shortly after its occupancy. The roof was leaking by 1968. The Washington Post published reports in October 1968 that SGI refused to fix the leaks unless residents dropped their opposition to the construction of the complex's fifth building. By 1970, problems at Watergate East led the press to dub the building the \\"Potomac Titanic,\\" and its residents filed suit against the developer in 1971 to correct the structure's problems. Another lawsuit, filed in February 1970, sought exclusive access to the underground parking garage the cooperative claimed as its own, and demanded that the developer stop selling spaces in the residents' parking area. SGI filed a $4 million counterclaim alleging \\"malicious embarrassment\\" and five years later paid residents $600,000 to settle the cases. The Watergate East was also the site of a major protest in 1970. In the weeks prior to the jury verdict in the trial of the Chicago Seven (in Chicago, Illinois), political activists began planning and then advertising that a protest would occur at the home of United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell (who lived in the Watergate East).\\"Police Bar March on Mitchell Home.\\" The New York Times. February 20, 1970. As expected, the verdict was handed down on February 18, 1970 (all the defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy but five were found guilty of incitement to riot). That night, more than 200 people rallied at D.C.'s All Souls Unitarian Church to prepare for the mass protest demonstration the next day. On February 19, several hundred protestors gathered in front of the Watergate East and attempted to enter the building. Several hundred police, bused in to prevent the demonstration, engaged in street fighting with protestors, forced them to retreat, and eventually launched several tear gas canisters to disperse the crowd. More than 145 protesters were arrested. Although a second protest was expected the following day, it never emerged and police spent the day drinking coffee and eating cookies and pastries baked at the Watergate East's pastry shop. The Watergate East tenants' cooperative refinanced its mortgage some time after 2000, and bought the land beneath its building. =Watergate Hotel and Office Building= Looking up at the Watergate from the interior courtyard and shopping center The Watergate Hotel and Office Building is one of the five buildings in the Watergate development. The Watergate Hotel Management and ownership of the hotel have changed several times since the mid-1980s. In 1986, Cunard Line, the cruise ship company, took over management of the hotel and began redecorating and refurbishing it.\\"Cunard to Manage Watergate.\\" The Washington Post. April 17, 1986. The British Coal Board pension fund sold the hotel portion of the building to a British-Japanese consortium in 1990 for $48 million. Blackstone Real Estate Advisors, the real estate affiliate of the Blackstone Group, bought the hotel for $39 million in July 1998. For a few years in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the Watergate Hotel was operated by the Swiss√¥tel hotel group. But the hotel underperformed other Swiss√¥tel operations of similar size, location, and price. Jean-Louis Palladin's eponymous restaurant in the building closed in 1996. The hotel subsequently underwent a renovation in 2000. Swiss√¥tel was purchased by Raffles Hotels and Resorts, and Raffles' management contract ended in May 2002. Blackstone began managing the hotel, and put it up for sale in the fall of 2002 (with an asking price of $50 million to $68 million). Monument Realty bought the hotel for $45 million in 2004 and planned to turn it into luxury apartment co-ops. But many residents in other parts of the complex (some of whom owned the 25 percent of the hotel not sold to Blackstone) argued that a hotel would better enhance the livability of the area and challenged the conversion in court. The hotel closed on August 1, 2007, for a $170 million 18-month renovation, during which the hotel rooms were intended to be roughly doubled in size to . But the renovation never occurred, and the building sat empty‚Äîconsuming $100,000 to $150,000 a month in security, heating, electricity, water, and other costs. Lehman Brothers, Monument Realty's financing partner, went bankrupt in 2008 and Monument was forced to attempt to sell the property. No buyer emerged and the Blackstone Group regained ownership of the hotel. The Blackstone Group transferred the Watergate Hotel to its Trizec Properties subsidiary. Trizec did not pay the hotel's property taxes for 2008 (which amounted to $250,000), and estimated that it would take $100 million to make the hotel habitable due to the stalled 2007 renovation. The hotel was put on the market in May 2009, but once again no buyer emerged. The hotel was auctioned off on July 21, 2009 (with the minimum bid beginning at $25 million), but there were no buyers and Deutsche Postbank, which held the $40 million mortgage on the property, took over ownership. The bank began marketing the property for sale, and Monument Realty submitted a bid in October 2009 to buy the hotel back. Monument was outbid by developer Robert Holland and the Jumeirah Group (a luxury hotel chain based in Dubai), but the deal collapsed in November 2009 when financing fell through. Euro Capital Properties purchased the hotel in May 2010 for $45 million, with plans to rehabilitate it over the next two years. Euro Capital announced its year-long, $85 million renovation of the hotel in January 2013. Among the improvements it wished to make were the addition of six outdoor \\"summer gardens\\" where liquor may be served. The plan would require the approval of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, which voted to protest the liquor licenses unless the company reached an agreement with all the tenant associations in the Watergate cooperative. A year later, the company said its design team, led by the architectural firm BBGM, had completed a plan to increase the number of luxury hotel rooms to 251 to 348, renovate the lobby to add a bar and lounge, add a restaurant with some outdoor seating, and add a rooftop bar with a small water feature. Euro Capital also said it would seek a hotel management company to continue to operate the Watergate Hotel as an independent hotel. Construction on the new interior elements is planned to start in March 2014. Euro Capital received the construction permits for its now $100 million renovation in May 2014. Architect Bahram Kamali of BBGM said the renovation will completely replace the electrical, HVAC, mechanical, and plumbing (fresh water and sewage) systems. The renovation now featured two new restaurants, upgraded ballrooms, and a new spa and fitness area. The meeting space, which was quite small by industry standards, was expanded to , and the ballroom enlarged slightly to . Watergate officials said the new rooftop bar will seat 350, and other internal structural changes will add nearly 100 guest rooms. Kamali said the interior will feature high-quality, expensive plaster, stone, and wood finishes, but the exterior's iconic textured concrete balconies will remain unchanged except for repairs, repainting, and new windows. Grunley Construction will oversee all the renovations. Israeli artist and interior decorator Ron Arad designed all the metal sculptures and other work that will be featured in the hotels' bar, lobby, and other interior space. The cost of the renovation was pegged by Euro Capital at $125 million in November 2014. The 336-room hotel reopened in 2016, nine years after it closed. Office building The office building portion of the building contains . In 1972, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) occupied the entire sixth floor of the 11-story building at 2600 Virginia Avenue. The DNC had occupied the space since the building opened in 1967. On May 28, 1972, a team of burglars working for President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign bugged the phones of and took photos in and near the DNC chairman's office. The phone taps were monitored from the burglars' rooms (first Room 419, later Room 723) at the Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge across the street at 2601 Virginia Avenue NW. During a second burglary on June 17, 1972, to replace a malfunctioning phone tap and collect more information, five of the burglars were arrested and the Watergate scandal began to unfold. A plaque on the sixth floor of the office building portion of the Watergate Hotel commemorates the break-in. The sixth floor space, occupied by SAGE Publishing since 2015, houses a private exhibit commemorating the break-in and ensuing scandal. The break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters was not the first break-in at the Watergate. The first break-in, however, shares a remarkable connection with the DNC burglary. The first break-in at the complex was the burglary of a residential unit in 1969. The victim was Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's personal secretary. The burglars took jewelry and some personal items. Woods would later be accused of erasing 18 and a half minutes from President Nixon's secret Oval Office audio taping system‚Äîspecifically, the tape from June 20, 1972, that proved central to the Watergate scandal. In 1993, the British coal board pension fund sold the office portion of the building (as well as the land under two of the three Watergate apartment buildings) to The JBG Companies (an American firm) and Buvermo Properties Inc. (a Dutch company). In 1997, JBG Cos. and Buvermo Properties sold the office building to the Blackstone Group's Trizec Properties division. Trizec put the office building up for sale for $100 million in 2005 and sold it to BentleyForbes Acquisitions LLC, a private firm owned by C. Frederick Wehba and members of the Los Angeles-based Webha family. BentleyForbes put the office tower up for sale on March 12, 2009. In November 2011, after 20 months on the market, the office building sold for $76 million to the Penzance Cos. In mid-2012, the office building's new owner began a multimillion-dollar upgrade to the Watergate Office Building's lobby, common areas, and Virginia Avenue entrance. The modernization was complete in December 2012, and the building began leasing space again in January 2013. Hitt Contracting designed the renovations, and oversaw the construction. Penzance sold the office building to a subsidiary of Rockwood Capital for $75 million at the end of 2016. Penzance retained a small ownership stake in the structure, and said it would continue to manage it for Rockwood. =Watergate South= Among the notable people who have lived at the Watergate South is former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. As with the Watergate East, residents of this building have discussed buying the land beneath their building, but there is no urgency as the lease on the land does not expire until 2070. =Watergate West= Construction problems and leaks at Watergate West led the press to ridicule this building, like others in the complex, as the \\"Potomac Titanic.\\" On March 2, 1971, residents of the Watergate West filed a lawsuit against SGI in which they claimed their units had defective stoves, faulty air conditioning, leaky windows and balconies, and deficient plumbing. SGI said the problems were similar to those with any new building, and that it had already spent $300,000 on repairs. Like the Watergate East, residents of this building have discussed buying the land beneath their building but do not need to do so until the land lease expires in 2070. =Watergate 600= Britain's National Coal Board Pension Fund sold the Watergate Office Building to John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance in the early 1990s. The building underwent a renovation of its office spaces in 1994. The building saw extensive renovations in 1997. The Atlantic magazine owner David G. Bradley purchased the office building in 2003. The new owner renovated the building again, a project which included expanding its lobby and restaurant space. In March 2017, the Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WashREIT) purchased the building from Bradley for $135 million. Under terms of the agreement, Bradley will also become owner of an operating unit within WashREIT. The new building owner said it would continue renovating various spaces in the structure, as well as upgrade and expand the rooftop amenities and build a new fitness center and new conference center.

They first appeared in Green Lantern #141 (June 1981), and were created by Marv Wolfman and Joe Staton. Publication history After appearances in Green Lantern, Action Comics and The New Teen Titans, the Omega Men were featured in their own comics series which ran for 38 issues from April 1983 to May 1986. During its run, writer Roger Slifer and artist Keith Giffen created the mercenary anti-hero Lobo. Later creators included writers Doug Moench and Todd Klein (who also lettered later issues in the run), artists Tod Smith, Shawn McManus and Alex Ni√±o, and inkers Mike DeCarlo, Jim McDermott and Greg Theakston. Members of the Omega Men also appeared in the 2004 eight-issue Adam Strange limited series, as well as the 2005 Infinite Crisis lead-in 6-issue limited series, Rann-Thanagar War and the 2008 follow-up Rann-Thanagar Holy War.Dan Didio on R/T: Holy War and Reign in Hell, Newsarama, 2-09-2008 In 2006 they had their own six issue limited series with Tigorr, Doc, Elu, Broot and Ryand'r - written by Andersen Gabrych and art by Henry Flint.Andersen Gabrych on Omega Men, Newsarama, June 9, 2006Alpha & Omega: Gabrych talks \\"The Omega Men\\", Comic Book Resources, August 17, 2006 Fictional team history The Omega Men hail from the Vega system, a planetary system with twenty-five habitable planets, which as of the early 1980s had been ruled for millennia by the Citadelians, a race of warriors cloned from the First Citadelian, the demi-godlike son of X'Hal. cover of Green Lantern #141 art by George P√©rez The Citadelians established a tyrannical regime based in a fortress moon known as the Citadel. The citadel then set about to conquer the younger races of Vega. Originally there were only two races in the Vegan system, the primitive Branx and the pacifistic Okaarans, but the Psions used Okaaran DNA to create the other twenty-three races of Vega such as the Tamaraneans, Euphorixians, Aelloans, Karnans, and the Changralyns. The Omega Men were assembled as a group of renegades and representatives of conquered Vegan worlds to fight Citadelian aggression. Pre-Infinite Crisis the team was based on the planet Kuraq. The Omega Men are important peacekeepers in their sector because the Green Lantern Corps is not allowed into Vegan space, due to a long-standing agreement with the Psions. The Omega Men made a return appearance in the Adam Strange mini-series. Still led by Tigorr, with veteran members Broot, Doc, Elu, Artin and Harpis. They were joined by a group of new members whose names were given, but not identified in the book. They were still fighting the Spider Empire. A vision by one of their new members, a precog, results in them waiting in a Rannian space station for some time; their ultimate purpose to meet Adam Strange. It was in this storyline that the first Doc is discovered to be a Durlan assassin. Doc himself is presumed slain. In the recent Omega Men mini-series, it had been revealed that upon returning to the remains of Tamaran with Ryand'r (who was not part of the team in the Adam Strange mini-series), the Omegans are attacked by the Darkstar zombies of Lady Styx and all but five of them died.

The new series, which lasted 12 issues, retroactively replaced the previous \\"New 52\\" Omega group in canon. The series, written by Tom King, rebooted the entire story of the Omega Men. In the new canon, the Citadel is now an interplanetary corporation. The Citadel, exploiting the chaos from the destruction of Krypton, has begun selling thousands of worlds rare metal that can be used to \\"stabilize planetary cores\\" to prevent a world from exploding ala Krypton. The rare, planetary core stabilizing metal, is only available in the Vega Star system. The planets of the Vega Star system as a result, have been wholesale enslaved by the alien corporation. Several worlds, whose inhabitants resisted the Citadal, were subjected to genocide: survivors of the genocide from these worlds, became the Omega Men. The group is led by Primus, recast as a wealthy pacifist who was imprisoned by the Citadel to silence him. Due to the power and influence over thousands of worlds, the Citadel has framed the Omega Men as terrorists and murderers. The reach of the Citadel even ascends to Earth: after making contact with the US Military, to broker a deal to sell them metal from the Vega Star System, the US Government secretly sends Kyle Rayner to broker a deal with the Citadel at the start of the twelve issue series. However, the head of the Citadel corporation forces Kyle to surrender his white power ring upon meeting him (for \\"security\\" reasons; in truth, due to him coveting the ring for his own selfish desires). Shortly afterwards, Kyle is kidnapped by the Omega Men, who fake his death and then force Kyle to join them on a tour of the Vega Star System so he could see the evil of the Citadel and expose their sins. Kyle eventually realizes the truth about the Citadel and with the Omega Men's help, crash an interview with the head of the Citadel, in order to air recorded footage of the Citadel destroying an entire populated planet that had been mined dry of the rare metal. The move clears the Omega Men's good name but fails to stop the Citadel's activities in the Vega Star System. A final battle between the Citadel and the Omega Men then ensues, ending in the death of the Citadel's leadership caste. Meanwhile, Kyle, who had assumed the alias of \\"Green Man\\" during the time with the Omega Men, regains his White Lantern ring and is ultimately banished back to Earth by the Omega Men when he fails to convince them to spare the leaders of the Citadel. =The Omega Men members= *Primus *Tigorr *Broot *DOC *Scrapps *Kyle Rayner *Kalista ReferencesSources  * External links * Titans Tower: The Vegan Star System * An index of the Omega Men series * Welcome to Vega: Omega Men at Cosmic Teams! * DCU Guide: Omega Men * Preview pages for issue #1 of the current mini-series and issue #2 ","title":"Omega Men"},{"id":"625220","title":"Proglacial lake"},{"id":"625223","text":"Queequeg is a character in the 1851 novel Moby-Dick by American author Herman Melville. The son of a South Sea chieftain who left home to explore the world, Queequeg is the first principal character encountered by the narrator, Ishmael. The quick friendship and relationship of equality between the tattooed cannibal and the white sailor show Melville's basic theme of shipboard democracy as well as his fondness for Polynesians (see Typee, Omoo and Mardi). Once aboard the whaling ship Pequod, Queequeg becomes the harpooner for the mate Starbuck. Near the end of the novel, he \\"casts the runes\\", which say he will die. He therefore builds a coffin and refuses to eat or drink, but he ultimately decides to stay alive and then recovers his health. The coffin is later converted to a lifebuoy after the ship's original one is lost. When Moby Dick sinks the Pequod, Queequeg is lost with the ship, clinging to one of the masts. Ishmael survives by clinging to the coffin until another ship, the Rachel, arrives to pick him up. Melville drew inspiration for Queequeg from a description in George Lillie Craik's book, The New Zealanders (1830), of Te Pƒìhi Kupe, a MƒÅori chief of the NgƒÅti Toa iwi famous for his travels in England. Description Queequeg is a native of a fictional island in the South Pacific Ocean named Rokovoko. The island is the home to his primitive tribe, who practice cannibalism, in particular devouring the flesh of enemies slain in battle. Queequeg claims that the only case of indigestion he has suffered was after a feast in which 50 slain enemies were eaten. He displays no shame regarding the practice, describing his people in a matter-of-fact fashion. In port, he prefers a diet of rare red meat, but will settle for whatever is on the menu, such as clam chowder‚Äîwhich is described as \\"his favorite fishing food.\\" Although the son of a chief, he chose to leave his island out of curiosity to see more of the world and to experience and evaluate the civilization of the Christian world. At first rejected by the whaler that landed on his island, he skillfully jumped from a canoe and clamped to the side of the boat as it was leaving for the open sea, at which point the captain relented.Ch XII Biographical At the opening of the novel, he is in the port of New Bedford, Massachusetts, having returned from a whaling voyage. Queequeg and Ishmael first meet when Queequeg returns late to the inn where he is staying, not knowing that Ishmael has been booked into the same room with him. Although Queequeg initially threatens to kill Ishmael, and Ishmael initially is afraid of this cannibal, the latter soon decides \\"better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\\"Ch 3 The Spouter Inn. Upon waking next morning about daylight, Ishmael finds Queequeg's arm thrown over him in the \\"most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought I had been his wife.\\"Chapter IV The Counterpane Ishmael convinces Queequeg to ship on another whaling expedition with him. At the time of the novel, he has been away from his home island for many years, so long that it is possible that his father is dead and that he would become the chief if he returned. Queequeg practices a form of animism using a small idol named Yojo, for whom he builds small ceremonial fires. As part of his religion, he practices a prolonged period of fasting and silence (which Ishmael calls his \\"Ramadan\\"), at one time locking himself in his room in Nantucket. Even after Ishmael enters the room, he keeps his fast and silence without acknowledging the presence of others. Nevertheless, he spontaneously attends a Christian sermon of Father Mapple in New Bedford, although he slips out before the end. He is unflappable and extremely easy-going among white society, never grudging an insult. He immediately takes to Ishmael and decides (based on advice from his idol) that Ishmael should decide on the ship for both of them together. Queequeg (center) and Ishmael approach the Pequod He is an extraordinary harpooner, demonstrating his skill for the money-tight owners of the Pequod by striking a small drop of tar floating on the water with one throw. The owners are so impressed that they immediately offer him a 90th lay ( of the ship's profit) in exchange for his signing on with the crew. By contrast, Ishmael (who has experience in the merchant marine but none as a whaler) is initially offered a 777th lay but eventually secures a 300th. In port, Queequeg carries his sharpened harpoon with him at all times, unless prevented from doing so. He shaves with his harpoon as well and smokes regularly from a tomahawk that he carries with him. Although he fades in importance toward the end of the novel, he is ultimately responsible for saving Ishmael's life from beyond the grave. After the Pequod is destroyed, Ishmael, the only character to survive, does so by clinging to a lifebuoy that had originally been built as a coffin for Queequeg while he was suffering from a fever. =Physical description= In Chapter 3 \\"The Spouter-Inn\\", Ishmael describes Queequeg's face/head as \\"of a dark, purplish, yellow color, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.\\" Later on Ishmael realizes the marks are tattoos and goes on to say \\"There was no hair on his head‚Äìnone to speak of at least‚Äìnothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.\\" Upon disrobing, Ishmael describes his body thus: \\"at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.\\" In Chapter 10 \\"A Bosom Friend\\", Ishmael describes Queequeg as having \\"large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold...He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor...His [Queequeg's] forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would... It reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in popular busts of him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\\" Cultural references * Sam Baker's most memorable role was Queequeg in The Sea Beast (1926). * A version of Queequeg appears as a character in the Futurama episode \\"The Day the Earth Stood Stupid\\". * On The X-Files, Special Agent Dana Scully named her dog Queequeg (last appearance Season 3 Episode 22) after the Moby- Dick character.

The concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D) and the equilibrium constant, K. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction.at constant pressure. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol‚àí1), then the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although in reality small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system.

Adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells which give rise to adipocytes through adipogenesis. In cell culture, adipocytes can also form osteoblasts, myocytes and other cell types. There are two types of adipose tissue, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which are also known as white and brown fat, respectively, and comprise two types of fat cells. Structure=White fat cells (unilocular cells) fasting state= Illustration depicting white adipose cells. A brown fat cell. White fat cells or monovacuolar cells contain a large lipid droplet surrounded by a layer of cytoplasm. The nucleus is flattened and located on the periphery. A typical fat cell is 0.1 mm in diameter with some being twice that size and others half that size. The fat stored is in a semi-liquid state, and is composed primarily of triglycerides and cholesteryl ester. White fat cells secrete many proteins acting as adipokines such as resistin, adiponectin, leptin and apelin. An average human adult has 30 billion fat cells with a weight of 30 lbs or 13.5 kg. If excess weight is gained as an adult, fat cells increase in size about fourfold before dividing and increasing the absolute number of fat cells present. =Brown fat cells (multicellular cells)= Brown fat cells or plurivacuolar cells are polyhedral in shape. Unlike white fat cells, these cells have considerable cytoplasm, with lipid droplets scattered throughout. The nucleus is round and, although eccentrically located, it is not in the periphery of the cell. The brown color comes from the large quantity of mitochondria. Brown fat, also known as \\"baby fat,\\" is used to generate heat. = Marrow fat cells (unicellular cells) = Marrow adipocytes, like brown and white adipocytes, are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. The marrow adipose tissue depot is poorly understood in terms of its physiologic function and relevance to bone health. Marrow adipose tissue expands in states of low bone density but additionally expands in the setting of obesity. Marrow adipose tissue response to exercise approximates that of WAT. Exercise reduces both adipocyte size as well as MAT volume, as quantified by MRI or ŒºCT imaging of bone stained with the lipid binder osmium. Development Pre-adipocytes are undifferentiated fibroblasts that can be stimulated to form adipocytes. Recent studies shed light into potential molecular mechanisms in the fate determination of pre-adipocytes although the exact lineage of adipocyte is still unclear. The variation of body fat distribution resulting from normal growth is influenced by nutritional and hormonal status in dependence on intrinsic differences in cells found in each adipose depot. Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into adipocytes, connective tissue, muscle or bone. The term \\"lipoblast\\" is used to describe the precursor of the adult cell. The term \\"lipoblastoma\\" is used to describe a tumor of this cell type. Function=Cell turnover= Fat cells in some mice have been shown to drop in count due to fasting and other properties were observed when exposed to cold. If the adipocytes in the body reach their maximum capacity of fat, they may replicate to allow additional fat storage. In some reports and textbooks, the number of adipocytes can increase in childhood and adolescence, though the amount is usually constant in adults. Individuals who become obese as adults, rather than as adolescents, have no more adipocytes than they had before. Body fat cells have regional responses to the overfeeding that was studied in adult subjects. In the upper body, an increase of adipocyte size correlated with upper-body fat gain; however, the number of fat cells was not significantly changed. In contrast to the upper body fat cell response, the number of lower-body adipocytes did significantly increase during the course of experiment. Notably, there was no change in the size of the lower-body adipocytes. Approximately 10% of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index without a significant increase in the overall number of adipocytes in adulthood. =Adaptation= Obesity is characterized by the expansion of fat mass, through adipocyte size increase (hypertrophy) and, to a lesser extent, cell proliferation (hyperplasia). In the fat cells of obese individuals, there is increased production of metabolism modulators, such as glycerol, hormones, macrophage stimulating chemokines, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the development of insulin resistance. Fat production in adipocytes is strongly stimulated by insulin. By controlling the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzymes, insulin promotes unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. It also promotes glucose uptake and induces SREBF1, which activates the transcription of genes that stimulate lipogenesis. SREBF1 (sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor synthesized as an inactive precursor protein inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by two membrane-spanning helices. Also anchored in the ER membrane is SCAP (SREBF-cleavage activating protein), which binds SREBF1. The SREBF1-SCAP complex is retained in the ER membrane by INSIG1 (insulin- induced gene 1 protein). When sterol levels are depleted, INSIG1 releases SCAP and the SREBF1-SCAP complex can be sorted into COPII-coated transport vesicles that are exported to the Golgi. In the Golgi, SREBF1 is cleaved and released as a transcriptionally active mature protein. It is then free to translocate to the nucleus and activate the expression of its target genes.Proteolytic activation of SREBF-controlled lipid biosynthesis. Clinical studies have repeatedly shown that even though insulin resistance is usually associated with obesity, the membrane phospholipids of the adipocytes of obese patients generally still show an increased degree of fatty acid unsaturation. This seems to point to an adaptive mechanism that allows the adipocyte to maintain its functionality, despite the increased storage demands associated with obesity and insulin resistance. A study conducted in 2013 found that, while INSIG1 and SREBF1 mRNA expression was decreased in the adipose tissue of obese mice and humans, the amount of active SREBF1 was increased in comparison with normal mice and non-obese patients. This downregulation of INSIG1 expression combined with the increase of mature SREBF1 was also correlated with the maintenance of SREBF1-target gene expression. Hence, it appears that, by downregulating INSIG1, there is a resetting of the INSIG1/SREBF1 loop, allowing for the maintenance of active SREBF1 levels. This seems to help compensate for the anti-lipogenic effects of insulin resistance and thus preserve adipocyte fat storage abilities and availability of appropriate levels of fatty acid unsaturation in face of the nutritional pressures of obesity. =Endocrine role= Adipocytes can synthesize estrogens from androgens, potentially being the reason why being underweight or overweight are risk factors for infertility. Additionally, adipocytes are responsible for the production of the hormone leptin. Leptin is important in regulation of appetite and acts as a satiety factor.

A skeletal formula shows the skeletal structure or skeleton of a molecule, which is composed of the skeletal atoms that make up the molecule. It is represented in two dimensions, as on a piece of paper. It employs certain conventions to represent carbon and hydrogen atoms, which are the most common in organic chemistry. An early form of this representation was first developed by the organic chemist Friedrich August Kekul√© von Stradonitz, while the modern form is closely related to and influenced by the Lewis (dot) structure of molecules and their valence electrons. For this reason, they are sometimes termed Kekul√© structuresThis term is ambiguous, because \\"Kekul√© structure\\" also refers to Kekul√©'s famous proposal of hexagonal, alternating double-bonds for the structure of benzene. or Lewis-Kekul√© structures. Skeletal formulae have become ubiquitous in organic chemistry, partly because they are relatively quick and simple to draw, and also because the curved arrow notation used for discussions of reaction mechanism and/or delocalization can be readily superimposed. Several other methods for depicting chemical structures are also commonly used in organic chemistry (though less frequently than skeletal formulae). For example, conformational structures look similar to skeletal formulae and are used to depict the approximate positions of the atoms of a molecule in three- dimensional space, as a perspective drawing. Other types of representations, e.g., Newman projections, Haworth projections and Fischer projections, also look somewhat similar to skeletal formulae. However, there are slight differences in the conventions used, and the reader needs to be aware of them in order to understand the structural details that are encoded in these depictions. While skeletal and conformational structures are also used in organometallic and inorganic chemistry, the conventions employed also differ somewhat. The skeleton= Terminology = The skeletal structure of an organic compound is the series of atoms bonded together that form the essential structure of the compound. The skeleton can consist of chains, branches and/or rings of bonded atoms. Skeletal atoms other than carbon or hydrogen are called heteroatoms.IUPAC Recommendations 1999, Revised Section F: Replacement of Skeletal Atoms The skeleton has hydrogen and/or various substituents bonded to its atoms. Hydrogen is the most common non-carbon atom that is bonded to carbon and, for simplicity, is not explicitly drawn. In addition, carbon atoms are not generally labelled as such directly (i.e. with a \\"C\\"), whereas heteroatoms are always explicitly noted as such (i.e. using \\"N\\" for nitrogen, \\"O\\" for oxygen, etc.) Heteroatoms and other groups of atoms that give rise to relatively high rates of chemical reactivity, or introduce specific and interesting characteristics in the spectra of compounds are called functional groups, as they give the molecule a function. Heteroatoms and functional groups are known collectively as \\"substituents\\", as they are considered to be a substitute for the hydrogen atom that would be present in the parent hydrocarbon of the organic compound in question. =Basic structure= As in Lewis structures, covalent bonds are indicated by line segments, with a doubled or tripled line segment indicating double or triple bonding, respectively. Likewise, skeletal formulae indicate formal charges associated with each atom (although lone pairs are usually optional, see below). In fact, skeletal formulae can be thought of as abbreviated Lewis structures that observe the following simplifications: *Carbon atoms are represented by the vertices (intersections or termini) of line segments. For clarity, methyl groups are often explicitly written out as Me or CH3, while (hetero)cumulene carbons are frequently represented by a heavy center dot. * Hydrogen atoms attached to carbon are implied. An unlabeled vertex is understood to represent a carbon attached to the number of hydrogens required to satisfy the octet rule, while a vertex labeled with a formal charge and/or nonbonding electron(s) is understood to have the number of hydrogen atoms required to give the carbon atom these indicated properties. Optionally, acetylenic and formyl hydrogens can be shown explicitly for the sake of clarity. * Hydrogen atoms attached to a heteroatom are shown explicitly. The heteroatom and hydrogen atoms attached thereto are usually shown as a single group (e.g., OH, NH2) without explicitly showing the hydrogen‚Äìheteroatom bond. Heteroatoms with simple alkyl or aryl substituents, like methoxy (OMe) or dimethylamino (NMe2), are sometimes shown in the same way, by analogy. * Lone pairs on carbene carbons must be indicated explicitly while lone pairs in other cases are optional and are shown only for emphasis. In contrast, formal charges and unpaired electrons on main-group elements are always explicitly shown. In the standard depiction of a molecule, the canonical form (resonance structure) with the greatest contribution is drawn. However, the skeletal formula is understood to represent the \\"real molecule\\" that is, the weighted average of all contributing canonical forms. Thus, in cases where two or more canonical forms contribute with equal weight (e.g., in benzene, or a carboxylate anion) and one of the canonical forms is selected arbitrarily, the skeletal formula is understood to depict the true structure, containing equivalent bonds of fractional order, even though the delocalized bonds are depicted as nonequivalent single and double bonds. = Contemporary graphical conventions = Since skeletal structures were introduced in the latter half of the 19th century, their appearance has undergone considerable evolution. The graphical conventions in use today date to the 1980s. Thanks to the adoption of the ChemDraw software package as a de facto industry standard (by American Chemical Society, Royal Society of Chemistry, and Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker publications, for instance), these conventions have been nearly universal in the chemical literature since the late 1990s. A few minor conventional variations, especially with respect to the use of stereobonds, continue to exist as a result of differing US and UK and Continental European practice, or as a matter of personal preference. As another minor variation between authors, formal charges can be shown with the plus or minus sign in a circle or without the circle. The set of conventions that are followed by most authors is given below, along with illustrative examples. > (1) Bonds between sp2 and/or sp3 hybridized carbon or heteroatoms are > conventionally represented using 120¬∞ angles whenever possible, with the > longest chain of atoms following a zigzag pattern unless interrupted by a > cis double bond.

The carbon atom labeled C1 appears to have only one bond, so there must also be three hydrogens bonded to it, in order to make its total number of bonds four. The carbon atom labelled C3 has two bonds to other carbons and is therefore bonded to two hydrogen atoms as well. A ball-and-stick model of the actual molecular structure of hexane, as determined by X-ray crystallography, is shown for comparison, in which carbon atoms are depicted as black balls and hydrogen atoms as white ones. The skeletal formula of hexane, with carbons number one and three labelled The 3d ball representation of hexane, with carbon (black) and hydrogen (white) shown explicitly. NOTE: It doesn't matter which end of the chain you start numbering from, as long as you're consistent when drawing diagrams. The condensed formula or the IUPAC name will confirm the orientation. Some molecules will become familiar regardless of the orientation. Explicit heteroatoms and hydrogen atoms  All atoms that are not carbon or hydrogen are signified by their chemical symbol, for instance Cl for chlorine, O for oxygen, Na for sodium, and so forth. In the context of organic chemistry, these atoms are commonly known as heteroatoms (where the prefix hetero- comes from the Greek word ·ºïœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ [h√©teros], meaning \\"other\\"). Any hydrogen atoms bonded to heteroatoms are drawn explicitly. In ethanol, C2H5OH, for instance, the hydrogen atom bonded to oxygen is denoted by the symbol H, whereas the hydrogen atoms which are bonded to carbon atoms are not shown directly. Lines representing heteroatom-hydrogen bonds are usually omitted for clarity and compactness, so a functional group like the hydroxyl group is most often written ‚àíOH instead of ‚àíO‚àíH. These bonds are sometimes drawn out in full in order to accentuate their presence when they participate in reaction mechanisms. Shown below for comparison are a ball-and-stick model (top) of the actual three-dimensional structure of the ethanol molecule in the gas phase, as determined by microwave spectroscopy, its Lewis structure (centre) and its skeletal formula (bottom). 120px 150px 120px Pseudoelement symbols There are also symbols that appear to be chemical element symbols, but represent certain very common substituents or indicate an unspecified member of a group of elements. These are known as pseudoelement symbols or organic elements and are treated like univalent \\"elements\\" in skeletal formulae. A list of pseudoelement symbols in common use is shown below: =General symbols= *X for any (pseudo)halogen atom (in the related MLXZ notation, X represents a one-electron donor ligand) *L or Ln for a ligand or ligands (in the related MLXZ notation, L represents a two-electron donor ligand) *M or Met for any metal atom ([M] is used to indicate a ligated metal, MLn, when the identities of the ligands are unknown or irrelevant) *E or El for any electrophile (in some contexts, E is also used to indicate any p-block element) *Nu for any nucleophile *Z for conjugating electron-withdrawing groups (in the related MLXZ notation, Z represents a zero-electron donor ligand; in unrelated usage, Z is also an abbreviation for the carboxybenzyl group.) *D for a deuterium (2H) atom *T for a tritium (3H) atom =Alkyl groups= *R for any alkyl group or even any organyl group (Alk can be used to unambiguously indicate an alkyl group) *Me for the methyl group *Et for the ethyl group *Pr, n-Pr, or nPr for the (normal) propyl group (Pr is also the symbol for the element praseodymium. However, since the propyl group is monovalent, while praseodymium is nearly always trivalent, ambiguity rarely, if ever, arises in practice.) *i-Pr or iPr (i often italicized) for the isopropyl group *All for the allyl group (uncommon) *Bu, n-Bu or nBu for the (normal) butyl group *i-Bu or iBu (i often italicized) for the isobutyl group *s-Bu or sBu for the secondary butyl group *t-Bu or tBu for the tertiary butyl group *Pn for the pentyl group (or Am for the synonymous amyl group, although Am is also the symbol for americium.) *Np or Neo for the neopentyl group (Warning: Organometallic chemists often use Np for the related neophyl group, PhMe2C‚Äì. Np is also the symbol for the element neptunium.) *Cy or Chx for the cyclohexyl group *Ad for the 1-adamantyl group *Tr or Trt for the trityl group =Aromatic and unsaturated substituents= *Ar for any aromatic substituent (Ar is also the symbol for the element argon. However, argon is inert under all usual conditions encountered in organic chemistry, so the use of Ar to represent an aryl substituent never causes confusion.) *Het for any heteroaromatic substituent *Bn or Bzl for the benzyl group (not to be confused with Bz for benzoyl group; However, old literature may use Bz for benzyl group.) *Dipp for the 2,6-diisopropylphenyl group *Mes for the mesityl group *Ph, Œ¶, or œÜ for the phenyl group (The use of phi for phenyl has been in decline) *Tol for the tolyl group *Is or Tipp for the 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl group (the former symbol is derived from the synonym isityl) *Cp for the cyclopentadienyl group (Cp was the symbol for cassiopeium, a former name for lutetium) *Cp* for the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl group *Vi for the vinyl group (uncommon) =Functional groups= *Ac for the acetyl group (Ac is also the symbol for the element actinium. However, actinium is almost never encountered in organic chemistry, so the use of Ac to represent the acetyl group never causes confusion); *Bz for the benzoyl group; OBz is the benzoate group *Piv for the pivalyl (t-butylcarbonyl) group; OPiv is the pivalate group *Bt for the 1-benzotriazolyl group *Im for the 1-imidazolyl group *NPhth for the phthalimide-1-yl group =Sulfonyl/sulfonate groups= Sulfonate esters are often leaving groups in nucleophilic substitution reactions. See the articles on sulfonyl and sulfonate groups for further information. *Bs for the brosyl (p-bromobenzenesulfonyl) group; OBs is the brosylate group *Ms for the mesyl (methanesulfonyl) group; OMs is the mesylate group *Ns for the nosyl (p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl) group (Ns was the former chemical symbol for bohrium, then called nielsbohrium); ONs is the nosylate group *Tf for the triflyl (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) group; OTf is the triflate group *Ts for tosyl (p-toluenesulfonyl) group (Ts is also the symbol for the element tennessine. However, tennessine is never encountered in organic chemistry, so the use of Ts to represent the tosyl group never causes confusion); OTs is the tosylate group =Protecting groups= A protecting group or protective group is introduced into a molecule by chemical modification of a functional group to obtain chemoselectivity in a subsequent chemical reaction, facilitating multistep organic synthesis. *Boc for the t-butoxycarbonyl group *Cbz or Z for the carboxybenzyl group *Fmoc for the fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl group *Alloc for the allyloxycarbonyl group *Troc for the trichloroethoxycarbonyl group *TMS, TBDMS, TES, TBDPS, TIPS, ... for various silyl ether groups *PMB for the 4-methoxybenzyl group *MOM for the methoxymethyl group *THP for the 2-tetrahydropyranyl group Multiple bonds Two atoms can be bonded by sharing more than one pair of electrons. The common bonds to carbon are single, double and triple bonds. Single bonds are most common and are represented by a single, solid line between two atoms in a skeletal formula. Double bonds are denoted by two parallel lines, and triple bonds are shown by three parallel lines. In more advanced theories of bonding, non-integer values of bond order exist. In these cases, a combination of solid and dashed lines indicate the integer and non-integer parts of the bond order, respectively.

This was added for clarity - multiple bonds are not normally coloured in skeletal formulae. Benzene rings In recent years, benzene is generally depicted as a hexagon with alternating single and double bonds, much like the structure originally proposed by Kekul√© in 1872. As mentioned above, the alternating single and double bonds of \\"1,3,5-cyclohexatriene\\" are understood to be a drawing of one of the two equivalent canonical forms of benzene, in which all carbon-carbon bonds are of equivalent length and have a bond order of 1.5. For aryl rings in general, the two analogous canonical forms are almost always the primary contributors to the structure, but they are nonequivalent, so one structure may make a slightly greater contribution than the other, and bond orders may differ somewhat from 1.5. An alternative representation that emphasizes this delocalization uses a circle, drawn inside the regular hexagon of single bonds. This style, based on one proposed by Johannes Thiele, used to be very common in introductory organic chemistry textbooks and is still frequently used in informal settings. However, because this depiction does not keep track of electron pairs and is unable to show the precise movement of electrons, it has largely been superseded by the Kekul√©an depiction in pedagogical and formal academic contexts.For instance, the acclaimed 1959 textbook by Morrison and Boyd (6th edition, 1992) uses the Thiele notation as its standard depiction of the aryl ring, while the 2001 textbook by Clayden, Greeves, Warren, and Wothers (2nd edition, 2012) uses the Kekul√© notation throughout and warns students to avoid using the Thiele notation when writing mechanisms (p. 144, 2nd ed.). Stereochemistry Different depictions of chemical bonds in skeletal formulae Stereochemistry is conveniently denoted in skeletal formulae: Image:Stereochemistry-example-3D-balls.pngBall-and-stick model of (R)-2-chloro-2-fluoropentane Image:(R)-2-Chloro-2-fluoropentane.svgSkeletal formula of (R)-2-chloro-2-fluoropentane Image:(S)-2-Chloro-2-fluoropentane.svgSkeletal formula of (S)-2-chloro-2-fluoropentane Image:Amphetamine-2D-skeletal.svgSkeletal formula of amphetamine, indicating a mixture of two stereoisomers: (R)- and (S)- The relevant chemical bonds can be depicted in several ways: * Solid lines represent bonds in the plane of the paper or screen. * Solid wedges represent bonds that point out of the plane of the paper or screen, towards the observer. * Hashed wedges or dashed lines (thick or thin) represent bonds that point into the plane of the paper or screen, away from the observer.American and European chemists use slightly different conventions for a hashed bond. Whereas most American chemists draw hashed bonds with short hash marks close to the stereocenter and long hash marks further away (in analogy to wedged bonds), most European chemists start with long hash marks close to the stereocenter that gradually become shorter moving away (in analogy to perspective drawing). In the past, the IUPAC has suggested the use of a hashed bond with hash marks of equal length throughout as a compromise but now prefers the American-style hashed bonds (Brecher, 2006, p. 1905). Some chemists use a thick bond and dotted bond (or hashed bond with equal length hashes) to depict relative stereochemistry and a wedged bond and hashed bond with unequal hashes to depict absolute stereochemistry; most others do not make this distinction. * Wavy lines represent either unknown stereochemistry or a mixture of the two possible stereoisomers at that point. *An obsolescentThe IUPAC now strongly deprecates this notation. depiction of hydrogen stereochemistry that used to be common in steroid chemistry is the use of a filled circle centered on a vertex (sometimes called H-dot/H-dash/H-circle, respectively) for an upward pointing hydrogen atom and two hash marks next to vertex or a hollow circle for a downward pointing hydrogen atom. 500x500px An early use of this notation can be traced back to Richard Kuhn who in 1932 used solid thick lines and dotted lines in a publication. The modern solid and hashed wedges were introduced in the 1940s by Giulio Natta to represent the structure of high polymers, and extensively popularised in the 1959 textbook Organic Chemistry by Donald J. Cram and George S. Hammond. Skeletal formulae can depict cis and trans isomers of alkenes. Wavy single bonds are the standard way to represent unknown or unspecified stereochemistry or a mixture of isomers (as with tetrahedral stereocenters). A crossed double-bond has been used sometimes; is no longer considered an acceptable style for general use, but may still be required by computer software. Alkene stereochemistry Hydrogen bonds Using dashed lines (green) to show hydrogen bonding in acetic acid. Hydrogen bonds are generally denoted by dotted or dashed lines. In other contexts, dashed lines may also represent partially formed or broken bonds in a transition state.

It is a cylinder of compact living cells, the radial walls of which are impregnated with hydrophobic substances (Casparian strip) to restrict apoplastic flow of water to the inside. The endodermis is the boundary between the cortex and the stele. In many seedless vascular plants, the endodermis is a distinctly visible layer of cells immediately outside the vascular cylinder (stele) in roots and shoots. In most seed plants, especially woody types, an endodermis is absent from the stems but is present in roots. The endodermis helps regulate the movement of water, ions and hormones into and out of the vascular system. It may also store starch, be involved in perception of gravity and protect the plant against toxins moving into the vascular system. Structure The endodermis is developmentally the innermost portion of the cortex. It may consist of a single layer of barrel-shaped cells without any intercellular spaces or sometimes several cell layers. The cells of the endodermis typically have their primary cell walls thickened on four sides radial and transverse with suberin, a water-impermeable waxy substance which in young endodermal cells is deposited in distinctive bands called Casparian strips. These strips vary in width but are typically smaller than the cell wall on which they are deposited. If the endodermis is likened to a brick cylinder (e.g. a smokestack), with the bricks representing individual cells, the Casparian strips are analogous to the mortar between the bricks. In older endodermal cells, suberin may be more extensively deposited on all cell wall surfaces and the cells can become lignified, forming a complete waterproof layer. Some plants have a large number of amyloplasts (starch containing organelles) in their endodermal cells, in which case the endodermis may be called a starch sheath. Endodermis is often made visible with stains like phloroglucinol due to the phenolic and lipid nature of the Casparian strips or by the abundance of amyloplasts. Function The endodermis prevents water, and any solutes dissolved in the water, from passing through this layer via the apoplast pathway. Water can only pass through the endodermis by crossing the membrane of endodermal cells twice (once to enter and a second time to exit). Water moving into or out of the xylem, which is part of the apoplast, can thereby be regulated since it must enter the symplast in the endodermis. This allows the plant to control to some degree the movement of water and to selectively uptake or prevent the passage of ions or other molecules. The endodermis does not allow gas bubbles to enter the xylem and helps prevent embolisms from occurring in the water column. Passage cells are endodermal cells of older roots which have retained thin walls and Casparian strips rather than becoming suberized and waterproof like the other cells around them, to continue to allow some symplastic flow to the inside. Experimental evidence suggests that passage cells function to allow transfer of solutes such as calcium and magnesium into the stele, in order to eventually reach the transpiration system. For the most part, however, old roots seal themselves off at the endodermis, and only serve as a passageway for water and minerals taken up by younger roots \\"downstream\\". Endodermal cells may contain starch granules in the form of amyloplasts. These may serve as food storage, and have been shown to be involved in gravitropism in some plants.Involvement of the Vacuoles of the Endodermis in the Early Process of Shoot Gravitropism in Arabidopsis, Miyo Terao Morita1, Takehide Kato1, Kiyoshi Nagafusaa, Chieko Saitoc, Takashi Uedac, Akihiko Nakanoc and Masao Tasaka, 2002.

Originally, this was to make full use of leftover scraps of fabric, but now fabric is often bought specially for a specific design. Fabrics are now often sold in quarter meters (or quarter yards in the United States). A \\"fat quarter\\" is one square meter (or one yard by the width of the fabric, typically 42‚Äì44\\") folded into four and cut along the folds, thus giving a relatively square piece of fabric 50 cm on a side, as opposed to buying a quarter of a meter off the roll, resulting in a long thin piece that is only 25 cm wide. Design Designs can be geometric and formal or imaginative. Patchwork blocks were initially created individually, accumulated over time, by use of scrap and salvaged material. Geometric designs were the most efficient way to aggregate fabric into useful units. Applique, where a piece of fabric is layered on top of the a base or \\"ground\\" fabric and then the cut edges are folded under and sewn down, is not limited to simple geometric designs. Early uses of applique in the United States included efforts to expand the effect of expensive, imported European fabrics in early America. The dense printed patterns were cut out, spread apart on a background of plain fabric, allowing the effect of the rare fabric to spread further. Broderie perse is a related technique, where selections of printed fabric are cut out, and sewn in place to produce the effect of a custom printed cloth. Reverse appliqu√© involves cutting the ground fabric, and placing another fabric beneath the opening. The raw, cut edges are folded under, and sewn onto the smaller piece of fabric below, creating a new design. Additional design options are provided by quilting techniques that alter the texture of the quilt. These include: trapunto (where additional batting to be sewn through is stuffed into a discrete section of the quilting), cording (where cotton cording or yarn are pulled between quilting lines that form channels), and stipple quilting (where dense, closely spaced quilting causes the batting to be more compressed than it is in adjacent areas). Another, more casual option is to \\"tie\\" the quilt. Heavy thread or yarn is used to tie all three layers together at points across the surface of the quilt. Layering The quilt is formed of three layers: the patchwork quilt top, a layer of insulation wadding (batting), and a layer of backing material. These three layers are stitched together (\\"quilted\\"), either by hand or machine. The quilting can either outline the patchwork motifs, or be a completely independent design, for when quilting, the design may not necessarily follow the patchwork design, and the design of the quilting may play off the patchwork design. Outline quilting is when the pieces of the pattern are outlined by the quilting stitches. History Though quilting has a long history, likely more than five millennia, and takes various forms in many cultures, the block-style patchwork quilt became a \\"distinct expression\\" of nineteenth-century America, evolving into a representative folk art of interest to scholars that is still produced today. Eighteenth-century patchwork \\"was a ladies‚Äô leisure pursuit\\" in both Europe and North America, with the earliest surviving specimens from Wiltshire in 1718 and Quebec in 1726 made of silk. The lack of information about earlier quilts made of humbler fabric, is partly attributed to such quilts being \\"intimately connected to everyday life\\" of the Dutch and English settlers in the New World. As a heritage object with distinctive patterns, the patchwork quilt has come to be particularly associated with Canada and the United States. A twenty-first-century offshoot is the barn quilt. Quilting was a very popular early American pastime, first in the Midwest, where quilting circles were a common social pastime for women, and later on the Great Plains, especially from 1825 to 1875, where quilting bees, when many women gathered around a quilting frame and quilted, became important social occasions. Such affairs might last overnight and sometimes took on political significance, such as during the movement for abolition. Annual town fairs generally included a quilting prize to award excellence in quilting. Handmade quilts were a very common wedding gift for young couples, and were often mentioned specifically in wills due to their sentimental significance. It was not uncommon, in early American culture, for quilts to reflect a mosaic of a woman's life, often including swatches of material from memorable events such as pieces of a wedding gown or a child's baptismal garment. The Amish people are famous for their geometric patchwork designs made with solid color fabrics, with independent patterns and quilting; typical motifs include floral designs and heart shapes. The Amish and Mennonite women of the Pennsylvania Dutch country have been creating exquisite quilted masterpieces since the mid-19th century (and some believe even earlier). Amish quilts are an expression of frugality. They not only serve a practical, functional purpose, but serve as a form of entertainment as well. In 1987 in San Francisco, the Names Project commenced as a memorial to the lives of people who died from AIDS and related diseases with quilt panels made by loved ones. Also known as the AIDS Quilt, it grew to comprise many thousands of panels, and spawned similar projects in countries around the globe. In later years, other subject- and event-specific community-based quilts have been created. Little Amsterdam Colorwash quilting This non-traditional method of quilting uses small blocks of color to achieve the look of a watercolor painting where there is no fixed pattern. Fabrics are chosen for their hue and tone. See also *History of quilting *Quilting *Patchwork *Quilt trail *Quilt art ReferencesFurther reading *Ferrero, Pat, Elaine Hedges, and Julie Silber.

Her sister ship, Malplaquet - named after a battle between Britain and France during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1709 - was renamed Jutland just prior to her launch on 20 February 1946, and was commissioned on 30 July 1947.

There is an electoral ward with the same name which includes Princetown. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 2,047. Description The village has a population of 458.Devon County Council, 2001. \\"West Devon parish population estimates .\\" The village stands on the small River Lyd, which traverses a deep narrow chasm, crossed by a bridge of single span; and at a little distance a tributary stream forms a cascade in an exquisite glen. The village is noted for its history and surrounding countryside and is popular with tourists. From its Perpendicular church of St Petrock fine views of the Dartmoor tors are seen. The parish of Lydford is immense, embracing some 50,000 acres (200 km¬≤) of land. Close to the church are slight remains of the castle of Lydford. Running south-west from the village is Lydford Gorge, a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) wooded gorge which has been cut through the slate rock by the River Lyd. The gorge area is owned by the National Trust.National Trust, 2004. \\"Lydford Gorge.\\" The gorge is noted for its 30-metre (100 ft) waterfall. Etymology The original Anglo-Saxon names for the village were Hlidaford or Hlidan, from hlid, meaning a cover or lid, referring to the almost perfect concealment of the river beneath the chasm at the bridge, and ford (crossing). Over the years the name mutated via Lyghatford, Lidefort and Lideford to the contemporary spelling. History Lydford Castle Historically Lydford was an economic powerhouse, not the peaceful village which it is today. The village was established as one of the four Saxon burhs of Devon by king Alfred the Great. It first appears in recorded history in 997, when the Danes made a plundering expedition up the Tamar and Tavy as far as Hlidaforda (i.e. Lydford). The attack is described in the following passage from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: :Her on √∞issum geare ferde se here abutan Defenanscire into S√¶fern mu√∞an and √æ√¶r heregodan √¶g√∞er ge on Cornwealum and on Nor√∞wealum and on Defenum, and eodon him √æa up √¶t Wecedport and √æ√¶r micel yfel worhton on b√¶rnette and on mannslihtum, and √¶fter √æam wendon eft abutan Penwi√∞steort on √æa su√∞healfe and wendon √æa into Tamer mu√∞an and eodon √æa up o√∞ hi comon to Hlydanforda, and √¶lc √æing b√¶rndon and slogon √æe hi gemitton, and Ordulfes mynster T√¶fingstoc forb√¶rndon and unasecgendlice herehy√∞e mid him to scypon brohton. :Translation: In this year, they (the Vikings) visited Devonshire and at the mouth of the Severn, pillaging in Cornwall, Devon and Wales. They went to Watchet, and there caused much damage by dint of arson and wholesale slaughter. Then they turned at Penwith Tail to the south and up into the mouth of the Tamar, travelling to Lydford, burning and slaughtering anything they came across, and burned down Ordwulf's monastery at Tavistock, carrying vast amounts of loot back to their ships. During the reign of Ethelred the Unready, there was a mint, and coins minted there were inscribed LVD., LVDA, and LVDAN. In the reign of Edward the Confessor it was the most populous centre in Devonshire after Exeter, but the Domesday Book relates that forty houses had been laid waste since the Conquest, and the town never recovered its former prosperity Under the Normans, and according to the Domesday Book, Lydford is taxed equally with London, giving an idea of its significance at the time, the reason being that the parish of Lydford embraced the entirety of the Forest of Dartmoor under the Normans (as it did until the 20th century). Until the 12th century parishioners from across more or less the entirety of Dartmoor were brought to Lydford for burial. The path used to make this final journey is known as the 'Lych way'. Many reports have been made of monks in white and phantom funeral processions seen walking along this path. The history from the 13th century centres round the castle, which is first mentioned in 1216, when it was granted to William Briwere, and was shortly afterwards fixed as the prison of the stannaries and the meeting-place of the Forest Courts of Dartmoor. A gild at Lideford is mentioned in 1180, and the pipe roll of 1195 records a grant for the reestablishment of the market. In 1238 the borough, which had hitherto been crown demesne, was bestowed by Henry III on Richard, earl of Cornwall, who in 1268 obtained a grant of a Wednesday market and a three days fair at the feast of St Petrock. The borough had a separate coroner and bailiff in 1275, but it was never incorporated by charter, and only once, in 1300, returned members to parliament. During the English Civil War, Lydford was the haunt of the then notorious Gubbins band, a gang of ruthless cut-throats and highwaymen, who took advantage of the turmoil of the times to ply their villainry. According to one account of the time: :Gubbins-land is a Scythia within England, and they pure heathens therein. Their language is the drosse of the dregs of the vulgar Devonian, They hold together like burrs: offend one and all will avenge their quarrel. In 1987 the parish of Lydford finally lost its claim to be the largest parish in England. It was split into two civil parishes, Lydford and Dartmoor Forest.Lydford Parish Council website The ecclesiastical parish has also been split, with Princetown made a separate parish.Diocese of Exeter: parish profile, Princetown Lydford Church The first Christian church in Lydford was a wooden structure built c. 639 AD. Recently discovered to have been built by Dudda Eadburg, a village local at the time. It is probable that this church was burnt down by the Vikings in their raid of 997 AD. The dedication of the parish church to St. Petrock would seem to indicate that it was built on the site of an existing British settlement. The church was later rebuilt in the perpendicular gothic style, and although ostensibly Norman, some of the architectural furniture, for example the font, were of the Anglo-Saxon style (or at latest, early Norman), thus it would appear that the church was rebuilt upon the site of the earlier building. The church was enlarged in the 13th century, the tower being added in the 15th century. A further enlargement occurred c. 1890 with the addition of the vestry and northern aisle. Lydford Castle Two castles have been built at Lydford, the first immediately in the wake of the Norman Conquest in 1066. The second castle was built on the site of the first castle in c. 1132 AD. It was a 3-storey tower, commanding a strategic view over much of the surrounding countryside, and was eminently defensible, with Lydford Gorge on one side, and the land sloping steeply away from it. Its use changed under the aegis of Edward I of England who made the castle the Stannary prison; its reputation was not good. Sir Richard Grenville used the prison as an oubliette for his political opponents. An order of Parliament during the reign of Henry VIII describes the prison in 1512 as \\"one of the most hanious, contagious and detestable places in the realm\\"; Lydford Law was a by-word for injustice. It was also one of the seats of the Bloody Assizes of Hanging Judge Jeffreys. The prison is commemorated in the poem Lydford Law by the Tavistock poet William Browne: At the time of Cromwell's Commonwealth, the castle was entirely in ruins, but in the 18th century it was restored and again used as a prison and as the meeting-place of the manor and borough courts. The site is now maintained by English Heritage,Palmer, D.W., 2004. \\"Lydford Castle .\\" and entry is free of charge.

It is critically endangered and may be extinct. The male crested shelduck has a greenish-black crown, breast, primaries, and tail, while the rest of its face, chin, and throat are brownish black. The male's belly, undertail coverts, and flanks are a dark grey with black striations. The upper wing coverts are white, while its speculum is an iridescent green. The female has a white eye ring, black crest, white face, chin, throat, neck, and uppers wing coverts and a dark brown body with white striations. Additionally, both sexes have a distinctive green tuft of feathers protruding from the head. Very little is known about this species because of the limited number of observations of it. It apparently breeds in Korea and eastern Russia and is probably a relict species that had a wider distribution in prehistoric times. Some think that this species is extinct, although occasional sightings are reported, including a number of reports made between 1985 to 1991 from the interior wetlands of China. Due to the persistent reports of the species' survival, it is listed as critically endangered. However, the crested shelduck has not been definitively sighted since 1964.  Taxonomy  Diagram depicting male and female plumage The crested shelduck was initially collected in April 1877 near Vladivostok, Russia.Fuller, 1987, pp. 54-55 However, it was not described until 1890 when the English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater decided that the specimen was a possible hybrid between the ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and falcated duck (Anas falcata).Johnsgard, 1978, p. 124 Around 1913, a pair was collected in Korea, and the male was presented to Japanese ornithologist Nagamichi Kuroda. Kuroda noted that the plumage of the specimens was not definitively intermediate between Sclater's suggested parents of the alleged hybrid. Another female was collected and given to Kuroda in 1916, and supported by three specimens of a bird which was clearly not a hybrid and a historical record of the species in Japan, Kuroda described this bird as Pseudotadorna cristata in 1917.Ripley, 1957, pp. 104, 132‚Äì133 The 1916 female was designated the holotype and preserved with the male in Kuroda's collection.Fuller, 2001, pp. 96‚Äì97 A member of the family Anatidae, this species was considered distinct enough to merit its own genus by Kuroda, but is now placed in the genus Tadorna, which includes six other species of Old World shelducks. The genus name Tadorna comes from the Celtic word tadorne and means \\"pied waterfowl\\", essentially the same as the English \\"shelduck\\".Kear, 2005, p. 420 The specific epithet, cristata, comes from the Latin word for crested.Kear, 2005, pp. 439‚Äì441 The species' common name is derived from the tuft of green feathers from the shelduck's head. This species is also known as the Korean crested shelduck, Korean sheldrake, and Korean Mandarin.  Description  The crested shelduck is sexually dimorphic, with the male possessing a greenish-black crown, breast, primaries, and tail, while the rest of its face, chin, and throat are brownish black.Beacham and World Wildlife Fund, 1997Madge and Burn, 1988, pp. 166‚Äì167 The male's belly, undertail coverts, and flanks are a dark grey with black striations. The upper wing coverlets are white, while its speculum is an iridescent green. The female has a large white eye ring, black crest, and white face, chin, throat, neck, and upper wing coverts. It also has a dark brown body with white striations. Both sexes have a green tuft of feathers protruding from their head. The crested shelduck is about long, and therefore is slightly larger than a mallard. Its bill and legs are pinkish, though those of the female are paler than those of the male. The bill of the male has a small, knob-like appendage at its base. The plumage of the immature is unknown.  Distribution and habitat  Sea of Japan, where most reports of the crested shelduck come from The crested shelduck has been collected near Vladivostok in Russia and near Busan and Kunsan in Korea. It has been proposed that the species breeds in far-eastern Russia, northern North Korea, and northeast China and winters in southern Japan, southwest Korea, and along the east China coast as far south as Shanghai.BirdLife International, 2001, pp. 399‚Äì552 (PDF) It is believed to have a relict range, or to have been more widespread in historic times.Nowak, 1983 This species is believed to live in a wide variety of wetland and deep-water habitats at varying elevations. While all collected individuals are from the coast, especially near river mouths, recently there have been a number of reports from interior wetlands in northeastern China. It has been speculated that this species may breed in mountainous areas either away from water or on volcanic lakes.  Ecology and behavior  Though not much is known about this shelduck, it is believed to be migratory, traveling from Siberia in the breeding season to Korea, southern Russia, and Japan for the winter. The crested shelduck is believed to eat aquatic vegetation, agricultural crops, algae, invertebrates, mollusks, crustaceans, carrion, and garbage. It has been suggested that this shelduck may be a nocturnal feeder. While its nest has not been described, similar shelducks nest in burrows and cavities; it has also been suggested that this species may nest in tree cavities. It has been proposed that this species lays less than ten eggs which the female alone incubates. It is believed to breed from May to July. The shelduck has been observed in flocks of two to eight birds.  Conservation  Painting by Joseph Smit The crested shelduck has never been numerous in modern times, though it is thought to have been more widespread historically due to its presence in Japanese aviculture. The species is known from only a handful of sightings and some retroactively declared it extinct in 1916 after a female was shot at Busan, South Korea. In 1943, a sighting of this bird was reported near Chungcheongbukdo, building hopes that the species persisted. A group of three birds, two females and a male, was sighted by two Russian students in 1964 in the Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago near Vladivostok with a small flock of harlequin ducks. In 1971 it was reported from North Korea's northeast coast and in 1985 two were reported from eastern Russia. However, there are severe doubts about the accuracy of the 1971 record. A recent survey of Chinese hunters resulted in a number of unconfirmed reports from northeastern China. For example, a Chinese forest worker claimed that he unknowingly ate two in 1984. There are also unconfirmed reports of about twenty crested shelducks in the Dashanbao region of Yunnan, though many believe this flock to be a misidentified flock of ruddy shelducks. It is believed that, if the species survives, there likely are fewer than 50 individuals. This species is threatened with extinction due to habitat loss, hunting, and overcollecting. In an attempt to gather reports of this species and raise awareness to prevent hunters from consuming this species, 300,000 leaflets were distributed in Russia, Japan, China, South Korea, and North Korea in 1983, with the only resulting report being the 1971 North Korea record. 15,000 leaflets were distributed in northeastern China in 1985 and 1991. While this garnered 82 reports of the species, follow-up surveys of the area failed to find the shelduck. The Tumangan Development Project is threatening to destroy potential habitat in the area of several of the historic records.  Relationship with humans  This duck was collected in Korea and exported to Japan between 1716 and 1736 for aviculture, where it was known as the Korean Mandarin Duck. It was captured for aviculture in Japan up to at least 1854 and was portrayed in the Kanbun-Kinpu, a Japanese avicultural work.Mukherjee, 1971, p. 71 Old Chinese tapestries also portray a duck similar in appearance to the crested shelduck. Kuroda claimed that Japanese hunters were still hunting the species in Korea in the 1920s. Three specimens exist in museums. The only male specimen is kept with a female in the Kuroda collection in the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology, Tokyo. The male was collected at the mouth of the Geum River in 1913 or 1914, and the female was collected near Busan in December 1916.Austin and Kuroda, 1953 The female specimen described by Philip Lutley Sclater, collected by Lieutenant F. Irmininger near Vladivostok in April 1877, was displayed in 1894 by the Zoological Society of London and today is kept in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. Two additional crested shelduck specimens are known to have existed, though both have been lost. The female collected in 1913 along with the sole male was given to a friend of the collector and subsequently has vanished. Additionally, around 1900 a Chinese hunter offered a specimen to a Peking University professor, but, as the professor did not realize how rare the bird was, he turned it down. In 1991, the crested shelduck appeared on a Mongolian postage stamp.

Publication began in 1924. While it generally reflected the prevailing views of the party, attempts were made to reflect a broader spectrum of left-wing opinion. At its peak, the newspaper achieved a circulation of 35,000. Contributors to its pages included Robert Minor and Fred Ellis (cartoonists), Lester Rodney (sports editor), David Karr, Richard Wright, John L. Spivak, Peter Fryer, Woody Guthrie and Louis F. Budenz. History=Origin= The origins of the Daily Worker begin with the weekly Ohio Socialist published by the Socialist Party of Ohio in Cleveland from 1917 to November 1919. The Ohio party joined the nascent Communist Labor Party of America at the 1919 Emergency National Convention. The Ohio Socialist only used whole numbers. Its final issue was #94 November 19, 1919. The Toiler continued this numbering, even though a typographical error made its debut issue #85 November 26, 1919. Beginning sometime in 1921 the volume number IV was added, perhaps reflecting the publications fourth year in print, though its issue numbers continued the whole number scheme. The final edition of the Toiler was Vol IV #207 January 28, 1922. The Worker continued the Toilers numbering during its run Vol. IV #208 February 2, 1922 to Vol. VI #310 January 12, 1924. The first edition of Daily worker was numbered Vol. I #311. The Ohio Socialist became Toiler in November 1919. In 1920, with the CLP going underground, Toiler became the party's \\"aboveground\\" newspaper published by \\"The Toiler Publishing Association.\\" It remained as the Cleveland aboveground publication of the CLP and its successors until February 1922. In December 1921 the \\"aboveground\\" Workers Party of America was founded and the Toiler merged with Workers Council of the Workers' Council of the United States to found the six page weekly The Worker. This became the Daily Worker beginning January 13, 1924.Goldwater, Walter Radical periodicals in America 1890-1950 New Haven, Yale University Library 1964 pp.10, 30, 42, 46 In 1927, the newspaper moved from Chicago to New York. =Popular Front changes= May Day parade float with statue reading the Daily Worker In politics, the Daily Worker consistently adhered to a Stalinist party line from the time of Joseph Stalin's rise to power in the Soviet Union. The paper maintained a series of correspondents in Moscow, including Vern Smith in the mid-1930s, who invariably depicted Soviet reality in the most favorable possible light. The paper upheld the verdicts of the Moscow trials, criticized at the time outside the USSR as show trials, and later exposed as having used fabricated evidence and extorted confessions. The Daily Workers editorials constantly criticized all opponents of Stalinist socialism, including other communists, such as Leon Trotsky, who was assassinated at Stalin's order in 1940. Beginning in the Popular Front period of the 1930s, when the party proclaimed that \\"Communism is Twentieth Century Americanism\\" and characterized itself as the heirs to the tradition of Washington and Lincoln, the paper broadened its coverage of the arts and entertainment. In 1935 it established a sports page, with contributions from David Karr, the page was edited and frequently written by Lester Rodney. The paper's sports coverage combined enthusiasm for baseball with the usual Marxist social critique of capitalist society and bourgeois attitudes. It advocated the desegregation of professional sports. =Post-World War II= The Daily Worker had constant financial and distribution problems. Many newsstands and stores would not carry the paper. The revelations of Soviet MVD spy rings inside the U.S. government, the 1945 revelations of former Daily Worker managing editor Louis F. Budenz, a self-admitted recruiter of agents for the Soviet NKVD (forerunner of the MVD and KGB), combined with the resultant intense anti-communism of the 1950s (labeled \\"McCarthyism\\") caused a large drop in the paper's circulation. The membership of the American Communist Party had fallen to around 20,000 in 1956, when Khrushchev's speech to the 20th Congress of the CPSU (the \\"Secret Speech\\") on the personality cult of Stalin became known. The paper printed articles in support for the early stages of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, a popular revolt by the Hungarian people against continued domination by the Soviet Union, which subsequently installed a puppet regime, the J√°nos K√°d√°r government, in Budapest and had begun to persecute its political opponents. The Daily Worker's editor, John Gates opened the paper for discussion of the topic, a novel event for a party-line newspaper, and one appeared to promise further liberalization and dialogue inside the Communist Party in the United States. Despite widespread dissension in the CPUSA, the paper finally endorsed Moscow's suppression of the Hungarian uprising. In the disruptions that followed, about half of the remaining party membership left the party, including Gates and many staff members of the Daily Worker. Owing to greatly reduced operating income associated with a reduced membership, the CPUSA was forced to cease publication of a daily paper, with the final issue of the Daily Worker appearing on January 13, 1958.Daryl Van Vleet and Jean Van Vleet, \\"Daily Worker (vol. 35, no. 7),\\" Oakland, CA: Bibliomania online catalog, accessed Aug. 30, 2016. After a short hiatus, the party published a weekend paper called The Worker from 1958 until 1968. A Tuesday edition called The Midweek Worker was added in 1961 and also continued until 1968, when production was accelerated. According to ex-CIA agent Philip Agee, a large number of subscribers during this period were CIA agents or front companies linked to the CIA. Agee claimed that the CIA's funding in this manner prevented the Worker from having to cease publication. =Two newspapers and a merger= In 1968 the Communist Party resumed publication of a New York daily paper, now titled The Daily World. In 1986, the paper merged with the party's West Coast weekly paper, the People's World, which had been slightly less closely hewed to the Moscow political line as the New York party organization and paper had been. The new People‚Äôs Daily World published from 1987 until 1991, when daily publication was abandoned. The paper cut back to a weekly issue and was retitled People's Weekly World (later retitled to People's World as to de-emphasize the weekly component), which remains the paper of the Communist Party USA today. Print publication of the People's World ceased in 2010 in favor of an online edition. Currently (2012), People's World claims that, \\"Peoplesworld.org is a daily news website of, for and by the 99% and the direct descendant of the Daily Worker.\\" Its publisher is Long View Publishing Company. The online newspaper is a member of the International Labor Communications Association and is indexed in the Alternative Press Index. Its staff belong to the Newspaper Guild/CWA, AFL-CIO.

In the biblical narrative, Adam and Eve eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and are exiled from Eden. As a metaphor outside of the Abrahamic religions the phrase typically refers to any indulgence or pleasure that is considered illegal or immoral. Biblical narrative The narrative of the Book of Genesis places the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, in the Garden of Eden where they may eat the fruit of many trees but are forbidden by God to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. In Genesis 3, a serpent tempts the woman: Desiring this wisdom, the woman eats the forbidden fruit and gives some to the man who also eats it. They become aware of their \\"nakedness\\" and make fig-leaf clothes, and hide themselves when God approaches. God curses the serpent, the woman then the man, and expels the man and woman from the Garden and thereby from eternal life. Quranic narrative According to the Quran, Surah Al-A'raf 7:19 describes Adam and his wife in Paradise where they may eat what is provided, except for one Tree they must not eat from, lest they be considered Zalimun (; wrongdoers). Surah Al-A'raf 7:20‚Äì22 describes () who whispers to Adam and his wife and deceives them. When they taste of the tree, their shame becomes manifest to them and they begin to cover themselves with leaves. Identifications and depictions The word fruit appears in Hebrew as ◊§÷∂÷º÷´◊®÷¥◊ô (p…ôr√Æ ). As to which fruit may have been the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden, possibilities include apple, grape, pomegranate, fig,The Fig: its History, Culture, and Curing, Gustavus A. Eisen, Washington, Govt. print. off., 1901 carob, etrog or citron, pear, and mushrooms. The pseudepigraphic Book of Enoch describes the tree of knowledge: \\"It was like a species of the Tamarind tree, bearing fruit which resembled grapes extremely fine; and its fragrance extended to a considerable distance. I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!\\" (1 Enoch 31:4). In Islamic tradition, the fruit is commonly either identified with wheat or with grapevine.Mahmoud Ayoub The Qur'an and Its Interpreters , Volume 1 SUNY Press, 1984 p. 82 =Apple= In Western Europe, the fruit was often depicted as an apple. This was possibly because of a misunderstanding of ‚Äì or a pun on ‚Äì mƒÉlum, a native Latin noun which means evil (from the adjective malus), and mƒÅlum, another Latin noun, borrowed from Greek Œº·øÜŒªŒøŒΩ, which means apple. In the Vulgate, Genesis 2:17 describes the tree as de ligno autem scientiae boni et mali : \\"but of the tree [literally wood ] of knowledge of good and evil\\" (mali here is the genitive of malum). The larynx, specifically the laryngeal prominence that joins the thyroid cartilage, in the human throat is noticeably more prominent in males and was consequently called an Adam's apple, from a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit getting stuck in Adam's throat as he swallowed it.E. Cobham Brewer (1810‚Äì1897). Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898. \\"Adam's Apple\\" =Grape= Rabbi Meir says that the fruit was a grape, made into wine.Berachot 40a; Sanhedrin 70a. The Zohar explains similarly that Noah attempted (but failed) to rectify the sin of Adam by using grape wine for holy purposes.Zohar Noah 73aThe Zohar: The First Ever Unabridged English Translation, with Commentary; Rabbi Michael Berg, ed., Vol. 2, pp.388-390 The midrash of Bereishit Rabah states that the fruit was grape,Bereishit Rabah 15:7 or squeezed grapes (perhaps alluding to wine).Bereishit Rabah 19:5 Chapter 4 of 3 Baruch, also known as the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch, designates the fruit as the grape. 3 Baruch is a first to third century text that is either Christian or Jewish with Christian interpolations. 3 Baruch, Chapter 4, available at: http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kazhdan/Shneider/apocr2010/3%20Baruch%20OTP.pdf =Fig= The Bible states in the book of Genesis that Adam and Eve had made their own fig leaf clothing: \\"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles\\". Rabbi Nechemia supports the idea that the fruit was a fig, as it was from fig leaves that God made garments for Adam and Eve upon expelling them from the Garden. \\"By that with which they were made low were they rectified.\\"Berachos 40a; Sanhedrin 70a Since the fig is a long-standing symbol of female sexuality, it enjoyed a run as a favorite understudy to the apple as the forbidden fruit during the Italian Renaissance, Michelangelo Buonarroti depicting it as such in his masterpiece fresco on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. =Pomegranate= Proponents of the theory that the Garden of Eden was located somewhere in what is now known as the Middle East suggest that the fruit was actually a pomegranate, a plant indigenous from Iran to the Himalayas and cultivated since ancient times. The association of the pomegranate with knowledge of the underworld as provided in the Ancient Greek legend of Persephone may also have given rise to an association with knowledge of the otherworld, tying-in with knowledge that is forbidden to mortals. =Wheat= Rabbi Yehuda proposes that the fruit was wheat, because \\"a baby does not know to call its mother and father until it tastes the taste of grain.\\" In Hebrew, wheat is \\"khitah\\", which has been considered to be a pun on \\"khet\\", meaning \\"sin\\".The Straight Dope: Was the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden an apple? Although commonly confused with a seed, in the study of botany a wheat berry is technically a simple fruit known as a caryopsis, which has the same structure as an apple. Just as an apple is a fleshy fruit that contains seeds, a grain is a dry fruit that absorbs water and contains a seed. The confusion comes from the fact that the fruit of a grass happens to have a form similar to some seeds. =Mushroom= A fresco in the 13th-century Plaincourault Abbey in France depicts Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, flanking a Tree of Knowledge that has the appearance of a gigantic Amanita muscaria, a psychoactive mushroom. Terence McKenna proposed that the forbidden fruit was a reference to psychotropic plants and fungi, specifically psilocybin mushrooms, which he theorized played a central role in the evolution of the human brain. Earlier, in a well-documented but heavily criticized study,\\"John Allegro, 65; Aided Deciphering of Dead Sea Scrolls\\", obit., NY TimesJohn Marco Allegro: The Maverick of the Dead Sea Scrolls, by Judith Anne Brown, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (1 March 2005), , pp. xii-xiii John M. Allegro proposed the mushroom as the forbidden fruit., re- released in a new edition by Gnostic Media Research & Publishing in 2009 =Banana= Several proponents of the theory exist dating from the thirteenth century. In Nathan HaMe‚Äôati's 13th century translation of Maimonides's work The Medical Aphorisms of Moses, the banana is called the \\"apple of eden\\". In the sixteenth century, Menahem Lonzano considered it common knowledge in Syria and Egypt that the banana was the apple of Eden.. Parallel concepts=Greek mythology= The similarities of the story to the story of Pandora's box were identified by early Christians such as Tertullian, Origen, and Gregory of Nazianzus.

It was discovered on 17 October 1936, by French astronomer Marguerite Laugier at the Nice Observatory in southwestern France. In 1988, the D-type asteroid was named after both the computer character code ASCII and the Japanese computer magazine with the same name.  Orbit and classification  ASCII is a non- family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì3.9 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,044 days; semi-major axis of 3.15 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 19¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its observation as at the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in November 1975, or more than 39 years after its official discovery observation at Nice.  Physical characteristics  ASCII has an absolute magnitude of 11.8. Based on the Moving Object Catalog (MOC) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the body has a spectral type of a very dark D-type asteroid, typically found in the outer main-belt and numerous among the Jupiter trojans. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of this asteroid has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, ASCII measures 23.752 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.045.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, ASCII, a computer character code and the name of a major Japanese magazine on microcomputers. The name was proposed by Syuichi Nakano, who identified this asteroid during his stay at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; a stay which was partially funded by articles he wrote for the principal Japanese ASCII magazine. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 2 April 1988 ().

It was the home of the Newark Bears, who played in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent minor baseball league. The Bears played in the stadium from 1999 until 2013, when they announced a move to the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball, but the team was folded shortly thereafter. The stadium was also home to the baseball teams of two of Newark's universities: the Rutgers-Newark Scarlet Raiders, who play in the New Jersey Athletic Conference as part of NCAA Division III, and the NJIT Highlanders, who play in the America East Conference as part of NCAA Division I. The stadium was named in honor of the original Bears, who were the top farm club of the New York Yankees from 1946 until 1949, and the Newark Eagles, who played in the Negro Leagues. Above the press boxes, the stadium featured a Hall of Fame bearing the names of famed players from the Bears and the Eagles and baseball players from Newark. The stadium cost $34 million to build. It was sold to a developer in 2016 for $23 million, and the site was designated for a commercial-residential project named Riverfront Square. The stadium was demolished in 2019. History The Newark Bears had joined the Atlantic League at its founding in 1998 but played their 'home' games at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut during that first season, sharing the park with the Bridgeport Bluefish. Since construction of the stadium was still not finished in 1999, the Bears played their first 20 home games at Skylands Park in Augusta, New Jersey, sharing the facility with the New Jersey Cardinals. The stadium hosted its first baseball game on July 16, 1999 when the Bears took on the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds. The Bears nicknamed the stadium \\"Brick City\\" or \\"The Den\\". Originally, the stadium was to be built along the Passaic River, perhaps at or near Riverbank Park, but the eventual site was at Broad and Orange Streets. The block of Orange Street, between Broad Street and McCarter Highway, was vacated to allow for the ballpark to be built. In 2001, the Bears added \\"Bears & Eagles\\" to the name of the park. The new name reflected the heritage represented by both the International League's Bears, and the Negro National League Newark Eagles, both of whom had played at Ruppert Stadium (demolished in 1967) in the area now called the Ironbound. Public transportation  The stadium was across the street from New Jersey Transit's Broad Street Station. Opened July 17, 2006, the Riverfront Stadium station on the Newark Light Rail provides service from Newark Penn Station. Demolition In 2019, the stadium was demolished to make way for a new development called Riverfront Square.

A trim level named the \\"New York Special\\" first appeared in 1938 and the \\"New Yorker\\" name debuted in 1939. The New Yorker name helped define the Chrysler brand as a maker of upscale models, priced and equipped above mainstream brands like Ford, Chevrolet/Pontiac, and Dodge/Plymouth, but below full luxury brands like Cadillac, Lincoln and Packard. During the New Yorker's tenure, it competed against upper level models from Buick, Oldsmobile and Mercury. Until its discontinuation in 1996, the New Yorker had made its mark as the longest- running American car nameplate. 1940‚Äì1942 The New York Special model was originally introduced as a distinct sub-series of the 1938 Chrysler Imperial. It was available in 1938 as a four-door sedan with a 298.7 CID straight-eight engine and a generous amount of comfort and space for the passengers (series C19).Lee, p. 145 For 1939 it was expanded with two more coupe versions and a two-door sedan and a larger, more powerful engine. Now the C23 series, it took on the \\"New Yorker\\" name, dropping the \\"Special\\" tag.Lee, p. 146 The first convertibles were introduced with the all-new body-design of the 1940 models. This, the C26 series, was the first New Yorker to be considered a standalone model rather than as an Imperial version.Lee, p. 147 It also saw the introduction of Fluid Drive, a fluid coupling between the engine and the clutch. The only transmission available was the basic three-speed manual. There was also the \\"New Yorker Highlander\\", a special version with tartan seats and other interior elements. 1941 Chrysler New Yorker convertible coup√© Lightly redesigned bodies were introduced for 1941, with the business coupe now being a three window design. The bodies were all marginally wider and lower, with increased glass surface. Another new model was the Town Sedan with the rear doors having the hinges at the forward edge of the doors. This year, the Vacamatic was made available, although unlike the version sold on six- cylinder models, the Saratoga/New Yorker version was a three speed transmission with overdrive. With America entering World War II on 7 December 1941, all automobile production came to an end at the beginning of February, 1942. Thus, the 1942 model year was roughly half the normal length. Cars built after December 1941 had blackout trim. The 1942s were quite modern, of a design which was heralding the post-war ponton style with fenders more incorporated into the bodywork. The grille consisted of five horizontal chrome bars which wrapped around the front, reaching all the way to the leading edge of the front wheelhouses. Some 12,145 New Yorkers of the C36 series were built this year. Chrysler would produce and experiment with engines for tanks and aircraft during World War II. One post-war application of this would lead to the creation of the first generation Hemi of the 1950s. 1946‚Äì1948 1948 Chrysler New Yorker After the war, the New Yorker became a separate series. Unlike most car companies, Chrysler did not make major changes with each model year from 1946 through 1948. Thus models for 1946 through 1948 Chryslers have the same basic appearance, noted for their 'harmonica' grille, based on the body introduced with the 1941 models. 1947 saw a minor redesign in tires, trim, and instrument panel, while the first 1948s were just 1947s with no visible changes. Postwar Chryslers continued to offer Fluid Drive, with the New Yorker now offering the true four speed semi-automatic transmission. 1949‚Äì1954 The 1949 New Yorker used Chrysler Corporation's new postwar body also shared by Dodge and DeSoto with ponton, three-box styling. The engine continued to be the 323.5-cid straight eight coupled to Fluid Drive and the Prestomatic four-speed semi-automatic. Body styles were reduced to club coupe, four-door sedan and convertible. Wheelbase on the New Yorker was increased to from the frame introduced in 1941. The previous design had been carried through early 1949, with the new (C46) series having been delayed due to a strike in late 1948.Lee, p. 157 A padded dash board was optional. The 1950 New Yorker was the more deluxe of the regular eight-cylinder Chryslers (Saratoga being the eight with plainer trim) with cloth upholstery available in (unusual for 1950) several colors, Spitfire straight-eight engine and roomy interior featuring \\"chair height\\" seats. The \\"Prestomatic\\" fluid drive transmission had two forward ranges, each with two speeds. In normal driving, high range was engaged using the clutch. The car could then be driven without using the clutch (unless reverse or low range was required); at any speed above , the driver released the accelerator and the transmission shifted into the higher gear of the range with a slight \\"clunk\\". When the car came to a stop, the lower gear was again engaged. The big news for 1950 was the two-door hardtop, or Special Club coupe as Chrysler called it, in the New Yorker series. The model was called the Newport in sales literature. Also, Chrysler added foam rubber padding on the dashboard for safety. 1951 Chrysler New Yorker convertible 1954 Chrysler New Yorker 1954 Chrysler New Yorker - view of Howard Hughes' special aircraft-grade air filtration system Chrysler introduces the FirePower Hemi engine for 1951.http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New- Brochures-July/1951-Chrysler-New-Yorker-Brochure/1951-Chrysler-New- Yorker-02-03 The engine becomes a popular choice among hot rodders and racers alike, a trend that continues to thrive today with its namesake second generation model. The FirePower Hemi equipped cars could accelerate 0 to in 10 seconds, faster than the Oldsmobile 88 Rocket engine of that time. The New Yorker also offered Fluid Torque Drive, a true torque converter, in place of Fluid Drive. Cars with Fluid Torque Drive came only with Fluid Matic semi- automatic transmission and had a gear selector quadrant on the steering column. Power steering, an industry first, appeared as an option on Chrysler cars with the Hemi engine. It was sold under the name Hydraguide. A station wagon was offered for 1951, with only 251 built. Its wheelbase is the longest ever used on a station wagon. 1952 saw a small redesign on taillights with the backup lights in the lower section. This was the last year for the wheelbase chassis for the New Yorker. Also in 1952, Harold A. Clark used a New Yorker as the base for a full-size sports car called the \\"Clark Cyclonic\\". The price was approximately $15,000 and Clark planned to produce 48 during the first year. Whether this car ever reached production is not known. The 1953 New Yorker had a less bulky look with the wheelbase reduced to , a one-piece curved windshield and rear fenders integrated into the body. Wire wheels were now an option. The Saratoga of 1952 became the New Yorker for 1953 while the former New Yorker was now the New Yorker DeLuxe. The convertible and Newport hardtop were available only in the New Yorker DeLuxe while the base New Yorker offered a long wheelbase sedan and a Town & Country wagon. The convertible was New Yorker's costliest model on the chassis for 1953 at $3,980 ‚Äì only 950 were built. Also new were pull-style exterior door handles. The 1954 was a premium version of a standard 1950s size body. Chrysler's interest in six cylinder vehicles began to wane in favor of the popular FirePower Hemi V8. The New Yorker was priced a little more affordably, at $3,230 for the standard and $3,400 for the DeLuxe. The standard model had a mild output while the DeLuxe was used as a testbed of the engine's capabilities by outputting . (Such power was unheard of in 1954 from its competitors.) Although introduced very late in the 1953 model year, all 1954 New Yorkers were available with the new two speed Powerflite automatic transmission. Fluid Torque Drive and Fluid Matic were dropped. 1954 was the last year the long wheelbase sedan was offered by Chrysler. 1955‚Äì1956 1955 Chrysler New Yorker Deluxe In 1955, Chrysler did away with the out of fashion high roofline designs of K.T. Keller and came out with a new sedan that borrowed styling cues from Virgil Exner's custom 1952 Imperial Parade Phaeton. The hemi engine produces this year. The result would become an ongoing trend for increasing engine output throughout the next two decades with Chrysler and its rival competitors. The Powerflite transmission was controlled by a lever on the instrument panel. The base model was dubbed the New Yorker DeLuxe, with the \\"plain\\" New Yorker name dropped. The club coupe was replaced by the Newport two-door hardtop, and a new, higher priced St. Regis two-door hardtop filled the spot of the former Newport. The sedan, convertible and Town & Country wagon were still offered. 1956 Chrysler New Yorker Town & Country Chrysler christened the 1956 model year's design \\"PowerStyle,\\" a product of prolific Chrysler designer Virgil Exner. The New Yorker gained a new mesh grille, leather seats, pushbutton PowerFlite selector, and a 354 cubic inch Hemi V8 with . Also new for 1956, Chrysler introduced an under-dash mounted 16 2/3 rpm record player, dubbed the ‚ÄúHighway Hi-Fi‚Äù, manufactured by CBS Electronics. A two way switch in the dash changed the input for the speaker from the all transistor radio to the 7 inch record player. The St. Regis two-door hardtop gave a unique three-tone paint job for a higher price and the Town and Country Wagon model was Chrysler's most expensive vehicle of 1956 at $4,523. This was the first year for the New Yorker four-door pillarless hardtop. Only 921 convertibles were made. 1957‚Äì1959 1957 Chrysler New Yorker 1957 Chrysler cars were redesigned with Virgil Exner's \\"Forward Look\\" at the cost of $300 million. The 1957 New Yorker had a powerful Hemi V8 engine rated at . This stylish car sold well with 10,948 built, but only 1,049 convertible models. The 1957 models also came with the TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic transmission and a Torsion bar suspension called Torsion-Aire that gave smoother handling and ride quality to the car. The New Yorker also sported fins that swept up from just behind the front doors. Early model year production had single headlamps with quad headlamps optional where state regulations permitted them. The single headlamps were dropped later in the year. The forward Look remained intact for 1958 but with new body-side trim, shrunken taillights and . The convertible model was still available, with only 666 made and only 15 working convertibles were known to still exist as of 2008. Sales were steady, but decreased from last year due to The recession of 1958. The car's reputation was also tainted due to rust problems caused by rushed production and testing. The biggest news from Chrysler in 1958 was the introduction of a cruise control system called \\"Auto-Pilot\\" 1959 Chrysler New Yorker The New Yorkers in 1959 had a new Golden Lion V8, new tailfins, new front end, and no Hemi. The FirePower (1G) Hemi ended production and was replaced by the less expensive and lighter wedge head engine. The Hemi would never return to the New Yorker and slowly ended its image as a performance car and re-branded it as a luxury car, ushered in with styling similar to the Imperial of 1958. The Hemi engine itself would not return to Mopar cars until 1964 with the second generation 426 Hemi. 1960‚Äì1964 1960 Chrysler New Yorker Town & Country For 1960, New Yorker had unibody construction, the carry-over RB engine had an output of . 1961 Chrysler New Yorker convertible The New Yorker entered 1961 with a new grille, slanted headlights, a continental kit on the trunk lid. The 413 CID \\"RB\\" Golden Lion V-8 continued. This is the last of the \\"Forward Look\\" models. Chrysler built 2,541 New Yorker two-door hardtops this year, the last until 1964 in Canada and 1965 in the U.S. 1962 Chrysler New Yorker The classic Chrysler fins no longer existed for 1962 and now only four-door models were offered as wagons sedans, and hardtops. The finless car was considered bizarre by many critics and sales were slow compared to its entry level sister car, the Newport which was identical in body style and offered a convertible model. The New Yorker was the last Chrysler to have a wheelbase. The 413 RB had a 4.1875 in (106 mm) bore and was used from 1959-1965 in cars. During that period, it powered all Chrysler New Yorker and Imperial Custom, Crown, and Le Baron models, and was also available on the lesser Chryslers, as well as Dodge's Polara and Monaco, and the Plymouth Fury as an alternative to the 383-cubic-inch B series engine and/or the 318 Poly. With a compression ratio of 10:1, it developed and of torque in 1X4-Bbl trim. 1963 Chrysler New Yorker 4-door hardtop Chrysler got a boost in sales in 1963 with the introduction of a five-year/50,000-mile warranty, a business practice that was unheard of by its competitors in the 1960s. The New Yorker used Chrysler's completely redesigned body with only the windshield showing traces of the previous Forward Look designs, although, under the skin, platform changes were near zero, with only a change from 12\\" Total Contact to Bendix 11\\" Duo-Servo brakes. A new, more luxurious Salon four-door hardtop was added at midyear as a trim package. Engine output was and the wheelbase was now . 1964 Chrysler New Yorker 4-door hardtop Changes for 1964 included a new grille, larger rear window and small tailfins giving the car a boxier look from the side. Canadians were given the choice of a new two-door hardtop, while Americans got the Salon option on the four-door hardtop and post. 1965‚Äì1968 All Chryslers (as well as large Plymouth and Dodges) were now built on an all-new C-body unibody platform which featured a bolt-on, rubber-isolated front sub frame. Elwood Engel designed the 1965 New Yorker (and all Chrysler models) with styling cues from his 1961 Lincoln Continental ‚Äî square side view with chrome trim along the top edges of the fenders. The styling began to share some visual similarities with the premium luxury sedan Imperial which received an all-new appearance in 1964. The standard engine was a Firepower V8, with single 4-barrel carburetion. As an option the buyer could order high- performance 413 from that year's Chrysler letter car, which came with an unsilenced air cleaner, dual breaker ignition, special camshaft and dual exhaust, and was rated at . In any case the engine was paired with the 3-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission. 1965 was the last year for the 413, as it would be phased out for the new 440 the next model year. For 1965 the New Yorker was offered as a 4-door sedan, 2- and 4-door hardtop, and as Town & Country 2- or 3-seat station wagon. The 4-door sedan was a six-window body style touted Town Sedan, also available in the Newport line and in Dodge form as the Custom 880 4-door Sedan. A 4-door, four-window sedan body style was produced but not offered in New Yorker guise. The two-door hardtop was now sold in the United States. While the 300 and Newport 2-door hardtops shared a rounded, convertible-styled roof, the New Yorker had a unique roofline, resembling that of the 4-door hardtops. The more formal and squared off lines were highlighted by a padded vinyl covering on the parallelogram-shaped rear pillar. The wheelbase of the New Yorker models, except the wagon, was . The Town & Country wagon was on the Dodge's wheelbase as all C-body wagons shared the same basic body. Factory options for 1965 included a vinyl rear roof pillar insert, Saginaw-sourced Tilt 'N Telescopic steering wheel, air conditioning and power options (windows, antenna and steering). The 1965 Chryslers were well received by the public, and the division's sales shoot up nearly 40% compared to 1963, to 204,002. 49,871 of those were New Yorkers, a 62% year-on-year increase. File:1965 Chrysler New Yorker 2-Door Hardtop.JPG1965 Chrysler New Yorker 2-door Hardtop File:1965 Chrysler New Yorker 2-Door Hardtop (rear).JPG1965 Chrysler New Yorker 2-door Hardtop For 1966 styling was an evolution of the 1965 themes. Changes included new grille, tail lamps and revised side trim. The biggest news was the adoption of the new Firepower 440 V8 engine. In standard form it produced ; the optional, high performance 440 TNT was equipped with a twin snorkel, silenced air cleaner and dual exhausts, and put out . The New Yorker line-up lost a model for 1966, as the Town & Country wagon was now marketed as a series on its own. The 4-door, six-window Town Sedan, and 2- and 4-door hardtop body styles were continued. 1966 was another good sales year for the Chrysler division overall, with a nearly 29% increase in production and sales to 262,495. Despite this the New Yorker numbers went down somewhat to 47,579. File:1966 Chrysler New Yorker (20965003143).jpg1966 Chrysler New Yorker 4-door Hardtop File:1966 Chrysler New Yorker (9654850563).jpg1966 Chrysler New Yorker 4-door Hardtop 1967 Chrysler New Yorker 4-door Sedan 1967 brought a complete redesign of all sheetmetal below the belt line. The most recognizable new styling features were wraparound parking lights at the front and taillights at the rear. A new fasttop design for the two-door hardtop replaced the more formal look of 1965‚Äì66. The four-door sedan reverted to the four-window style as used on the Newport line. Sales fell 20%, the company's lowest in five years due to an economic slump that year. Styling changes for 1968 included new grille, bumpers, front sheetmetal, rear fenders and rear deck. Although the Newport and 300 four-door hardtops received a new, sportier roofline shared with Dodge and Plymouth, the New Yorker continued with the roofline first introduced for 1965. Main exterior features distinguishing the New Yorker from the other Chrysler lines were a full-width grille with a rectangular pattern, repeated at the rear by the full-width deck trim, and continuous lower bodyside molding. Chrysler production rebounded with the year setting a record at 264,863 cars built, 48,143 of which were New Yorkers.

The previous generation's underpinnings remained. The new look was called \\"Fuselage Styling\\" and was shared with the restyled Imperial. The two-door hardtop received a new look harking back to the club coupes of the 1940s. The 1970 Chryslers received minor styling changes to the grille, taillamps and trim. The small vent windows on the front doors were dropped on the two-door hardtops. Due to lower-than-expected sales, the facelift scheduled for 1971 was put off until 1972. Thus the 1971 models only received new grilles and taillamps. Ventless front-door windows on the four-door sedan and hardtop were new this year. For 1972, engine power dropped to meet stricter emissions standards and rising gas prices. Chryslers received a new 'split grille' somewhat similar to the Dodge Chargers of 1971-1974. This would be the last year for the 'loop'-style front bumpers on Chryslers. 1973 was the final year for the distinctive Chrysler \\"Fuselage Styling\\"; only the grille was changed.

This generation introduced covered headlights, and a more prominent \\"waterfall\\" style grille, reflecting popular styling appearances, primarily used on the Lincoln Continental. These 1974 models happened to debut at almost precisely the same time that the 1973 OPEC oil embargo began, and were a significant part of Chrysler's economic woes in the late 1970s. The 1974 models were the last full-size models Chrysler designed from the ground up. Two New Yorker trim levels were offered in 1974, the base New Yorker and an upgraded New Yorker Brougham. A new St. Regis option package was added mid-year. For 1975, the New Yorker received a slightly revised grille and New Yorker Brougham became the sole trim designation. The St. Regis package, introduced in mid-1974, returned for its first full year. In 1976, the New Yorker inherited the front and rear end styling of the discontinued Imperial, and its interiors as well, especially, covered headlights. The Imperial styling gave the New Yorker an unforeseen boost in sales, as the car looked distinctly different from the lower priced Newport. The styling cues formerly used on the 1974 and 1975 New Yorkers in turn were passed on to the base Chrysler Newport. In 1977, the standard 440-cid V8 engine was now computer-controlled with a new \\"lean burn\\" system allowing for more responsive acceleration and performance. The 1978 New Yorker Brougham was available in 2-door and 4-door hardtop body styles. Both were the last U.S.-built true pillarless hardtop models along with featuring frameless door glass and fully opening windows. An optional \\"St. Regis\\" package included a partial \\"formal\\" padded vinyl roof that included a fixed B-pillar and opera window. This was also the final year a 2-door New Yorker was offered. Appearance changes were limited to a new segmented grill design, dual accent tape strips on the lower body sides, new rear deck stripes, and bright accents on the taillamps. The V8 engine ( in California and high altitude regions) was now the standard engine with the becoming optional. The last year of the C-body New Yorker Broughams saw engineering changes that included a revised windshield wiper linkage bushing, redesigned front and rear plastic fender extensions for the bumpers, and thinner glass. 1979‚Äì1981 1979‚Äì1981 New Yorkers featured full-width tail lights 1981 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue (shown with optional alloy road wheels, and concealed headlamp doors in open position) In 1979, the R-body series was a \\"Pillared Hardtop.\\" It now used the 318 V8; the 360 engine was optional through 1980. While shorter and much lighter than the previous generation, these cars still had a big car look and ride. Hidden headlamps and full-width taillights distinguished it from its R-body siblings Newport, St. Regis and Gran Fury. A new \\"Fifth Avenue\\" trim package was offered. For 1980, in addition to last year's \\"Fifth Avenue\\" package, a limited production \\"Fifth Avenue Limited Edition\\" package was also offered featuring brushed stainless steel roof treatment and exclusive mahogany metallic paint. Finally, a bold new grille, with simple vertical ribs, appeared for 1981. The ‚ÄúFifth Avenue‚Äù option package was again available plus a new \\"Carriage Roof\\" package was added. This package was available fully loaded with few options and was available only in nightwatch blue or mahogany metallic. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" +Production FiguresThe Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 Edition - ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Year ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Units - !align=\\"centered\\" 1979  54,640 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1980  13,513 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1981  6,548 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:silver;\\" Total Production = 74,701 } 1982 In an effort of downsizing, the 1982 Chrysler New Yorker (and the Fifth Avenue trim) moved to the corporate M-body. In turn, the Chrysler LeBaron, which had previously used the M-body, moved to the K-body this year. The 1982 New Yorker was not a completely new vehicle. It was essentially a restyled and upgraded version of the LeBaron which had been produced since 1977. This M-body New Yorker used Chrysler's slant-six engine. The 318 in¬≥ engine was optional. The 1982 New Yorker was available in two trims: Base and Fifth Avenue. Both used the formal roof treatment. The Fifth Avenue package gave buyers a choice of pillowed \\"Corinthian\\" leather or Kimberley velvet seats while base models had cloth or optional leather seats. This car became the \\"Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue\\" for 1983, and for 1984 the \\"New Yorker\\" prefix was dropped altogether; becoming the '\\"Chrysler Fifth Avenue\\". { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" +Production figures - ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Year ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Units - !align=\\"centered\\" 1982  50,509 } 1983‚Äì1988 1984 Chrysler New Yorker 1987 Chrysler New Yorker digital instrument panel In 1983, the New Yorker name was used on two different models. The M-body car was now the \\"New Yorker Fifth Avenue\\" a name which changed to simply \\"Fifth Avenue\\" from 1984 to 1989. The other was an all new K-car based New Yorker, which used the front-wheel drive Chrysler E platform, the beginning of the extended K-car years. The E-platform New Yorker came with state-of-the-art 1980s technology, including a digital dashboard and Electronic Voice Alert, which spoke notifications such as \\"A door is ajar\\"; \\"Please fasten your seat belts\\"; \\"Don't forget your keys\\"; \\"Thank you\\" (after fastening seat belt, closing the door tightly or removing the key from the ignition switch); \\"Your engine oil pressure is low - prompt service is required\\". Also standard was a Landau vinyl roof with electroluminescent opera lamps. This was the only Chrysler New Yorker generation with an inline-four engine. 1983 was a limited production year for the FWD New Yorker. When introduced in 1983, it shared many elements with the Chrysler E-Class and had a waterfall grille that was slightly different from the 1984-1988 versions. For 1984, restyled wraparound taillights and a revised front grille, were among the cosmetic changes. A 2.2 L I4 turbo engine was now an option and new electronic instrumentation featured a digital speedometer and odometer. Pillowed velvet seats replaced deep-nap cloth seats as standard. In 1985, the standard engine switched from 2.2 L I4 to Mitsubishi-sourced 2.6 L I4. New standard interior features included overhead storage console with reading lamps, rear seat headrests, and power windows. In 1986, a Chrysler- built 2.5 L I4 replaced 2.6 L I4 as standard engine. Also new was an automatic load leveling suspension. Cosmetically, rear deck lid panels, moldings and taillights were redesigned. Interior changes included a new forward console and revised electronic instrumentation and an AM/FM stereo and deluxe intermittent wipers were now standard. In 1987, hood vents were eliminated on the turbo models, as were fender louvers on all models. A new six-speaker Infinity sound system was optional. As with other Chryslers, the steering wheel was redesigned. This was the best-selling and last full model year for the E-platform New Yorker. Although a new thirteenth generation New Yorker was introduced for 1988, the twelfth generation continued for one more abbreviated model year as the 1988 New Yorker Turbo. As the model name suggested, the 2.2 L I4 turbo was now the standard and only available engine. In addition to the turbo engine, previously optional yet commonly ordered equipment like automatic temperature control air conditioning, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, rear window defogger, and power door locks became standard. While previous model year New Yorkers equipped with the optional turbo engine were also commonly referred to as a \\"New Yorker Turbo\\" and wore \\"Turbo\\" badges, only the 1988 model had it as its official model name. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" +Production figures - ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Year ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Units - !align=\\"centered\\" 1983  33,832 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1984  60,501 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1985  60,700 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1986  51,099 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1987  68,279 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1988 (Turbo)  8,805 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:silver;\\" Total Production = 283,216 } 1988‚Äì1993 1989 Chrysler New Yorker Landau 1992 Chrysler New Yorker Salon The redesigned New Yorker for 1988 was bigger (see Chrysler C platform) and bore no resemblance to the E-body model it replaced although many underbody and suspension components were carryover. It shared similar upright body styling with the newly introduced Dodge Dynasty. This new version had a V6 engine ‚Äî a Mitsubishi-sourced 3.0 liter powerplant, and optional anti-lock brakes. Base and Landau trim choices were offered, the latter of which carried a rear-quarter vinyl top. Hidden headlamps, a feature lost when the R-body cars were discontinued, made a return with this redesign. All thirteenth generation New Yorkers, as well as the reintroduced flagship 1990-1993 Imperial, were covered by Chrysler's market-leading \\"Crystal Key Owner Care Program\\" which included a 5-year/50,000-mile limited warranty and 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. A 24-hour toll-free customer service hotline was also provided. For 1989, the 3.0 liter V6 engine had a slight horsepower increase and was now mated to a new 4-speed Ultradrive automatic transmission. This year also marked the 50th anniversary of the \\"New Yorker\\" name. Although no special anniversary edition or recognition was offered at the time, it turned out to be the most popular New Yorker of the model run with over 100,000 units produced that year. In 1990, a new base model New Yorker called \\"Salon\\" was added. The Salon was a rebadged Dodge Dynasty with exposed headlamps, horizontal taillights, and grille similar to the Dodge. The Salon was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Dynasty. All models carried a new Chrysler-built 3.3 L V6 engine that year. Minor changes to the interior included a more contemporary contoured dash. A driver's side air bag was now standard. The Landau model was dropped for 1991 but Salon was upgraded and now came with more standard equipment, hidden headlights, vertical taillights, and a traditional Chrysler grille. A styling update for 1992 produced a more rounded appearance front and rear. A padded landau roof, similar to one previously featured on the \\"Landau\\" model, was now an option on the Salon. Last year's restyle carried into 1993. The last thirteenth generation New Yorker rolled off the assembly line on May 28, 1993. =New Yorker Fifth Avenue= In 1990, a new stretched-wheelbase version of the New Yorker was offered carrying the additional moniker of Fifth Avenue from the just-departed M-body platform. Although officially sold as the New Yorker Fifth Avenue, it was sometimes referred to as simply \\"Fifth Avenue.\\" This model was discontinued in 1993. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" +Production Figures - ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Year ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Units - !align=\\"centered\\" 1988  70,968 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1989  100,461 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1990  86,004 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1991  55,229 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1992  51,650 - !align=\\"centered\\" 1993  52,128 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:silver;\\" Total Production = 416,440 } 1994‚Äì1997 1994‚Äì1996 Chrysler New Yorker The final generation of the New Yorker continued with front-wheel drive on an elongated version of the new Chrysler LH platform and was shown at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It was released in May 1993 along with the nearly identical Chrysler LHS as an early 1994 model, eight months after the original LH cars: the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid, and Eagle Vision, were introduced. The New Yorker came standard with the 3.5 L EGE which produced . Chrysler gave the New Yorker a more \\"traditional American\\" luxury image, and the LHS a more European performance image (as was done with the Eagle Vision). Little separated New Yorker from LHS in appearance, with New Yorker's chrome hood trim, body-color cladding, standard chrome wheel covers and 15\\" wheels, column shifter and front bench seat, being the only noticeable differences. An option provided for 16\\" wheels and a firmer suspension type (\\"touring suspension\\"). This option eliminated the technical differences between New Yorker and LHS. LHS came with almost all of New Yorker's optional features as standard equipment and featured the firmer tuned suspension, to go with its more European image. During the 1994 model run, various changes were made to the New Yorker. On the outside, New Yorker was switched to new accent-color body cladding, whereas LHS received body-color cladding. This change aligned New Yorker with the Chrysler Concorde which also had accent-color cladding. Instead of standard 15\\" and optional 16\\" wheels, for the sake of enhanced stability 16\\" wheels became standard and the 15\\" wheels were dropped. Likewise, the touring suspension option available on early 1994 New Yorker models was discontinued, leaving only \\"ride-tuned\\" suspension. This resulted in a permanent technical difference with LHS. For 1995, the New Yorker received Chrysler's revived blue ribbon logo (which was last used in the 1950s) on its grille, which replaced the pentastar which had been used on models beginning in 1980. The 1996 model featured additional sound insulation and revised structural engineering to give it a quieter ride. A new built-in transmitter replaced the remote garage door opener. The antenna was now integrated in the rear window. Due to similarities between the New Yorker and LHS, and the LHS's strong sales, the New Yorker name was dropped after a short 1996 production run. Despite being far more contemporary and monochromatic in design compared to previous models, the traditional New Yorker with its two-tone cladding and chrome trim still did not follow the modern, monochromatic styling trend of the division's other vehicles in 1996. =LH design background= The fourteenth, and final, generation New Yorker's design can be traced to 1986, when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage. It was also at this time that the Chrysler Corporation purchased bankrupt Italian sports car manufacturer Lamborghini. The Navajo's exterior design was reworked and became the Lamborghini Portofino, released as a concept at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler's decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino's revolutionary exterior design, called \\"cab-forward\\". The cab forward design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a much larger passenger cabin than the contemporaries of the time. Design of the chassis began in the late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought another automaker: American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler Fifth Avenue as well as a potential Plymouth. The initial design of Dodge's LH bore resemblance to the Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after Fran√ßois Castaing, formerly AMC's Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988. The new design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the Eagle Premier, also sold later as the Dodge Monaco. The Premier's longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or rear-wheel drive (designated \\"LH\\" and \\"LX\\" respectively). The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler prototypes: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and 1990 Eagle Optima. The transmission was inspired by the Eagle Premier's ZF automatic. However, it borrowed heavily from Chrysler's A604 (41TE) \\"Ultradrive\\" transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE). This Ultradrive transmission however was not without critics as The New York Times reported on January 25, 1991 that Consumers Union would publish in the February 1991 issue of the magazine Consumer Reports a warning for consumers to not purchase a vehicle with this \\"Ultradrive\\" transmission citing poor reliability and safety hazards. By 1990, it was decided that the new technologically advanced car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3 L pushrod V6, which would be used in the three original LH cars, the Intrepid, Vision, and Concorde, in base form. The 3.3 L engine's 60¬∞ block was bored out to 3.5 L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with SOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5 L V6 optional in the three smaller cars, but standard in LHS and New Yorker. The general LH appearance, still based on the cab forward exterior design of the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino concept, with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. This sleek styling gives the LH cars a low drag coefficient which was ahead of its time. The New Yorker featured a more monochromatic design inside and out (but less so than its LHS sibling, which had very little chromed trim), and aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design. The single color motif was more pronounced on models without the grey lower cladding. Upscale New Yorker models feature leather-trimmed seats, steering wheel, shift knob and door inserts. Passenger comforts include rear center rear armrest, and 8-way power seats for both the driver and passenger, as well as personal reading lamps. Power windows and central door locks were standard, as was climate control with air conditioning, and cruise control. remote keyless entry available as an option, as was a remote activated alarm, an overhead console with computer, power moonroof and alloy wheels. The best stock audio options found in New Yorker are the Infinity sound systems having eight speakers positioned throughout the cabin along with an equalizer. Head units include a radio with either cassette or CD playback, and up to a five- band adjustable graphic equalizer, with joystick balance and fade control. Standard safety features included dual front airbags, anti-lock brakes (ABS), and traction control. Dual-way power sunroofs were available on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof Corp. (now ASC Global) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated most of the front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or onboard computer with integrated map lights, was retained. =LHS= Chrysler LHS The five-passenger Chrysler LHS was differentiated from its New Yorker counterpart by a floor console and shifter, five-passenger seating, lack of chrome trim, an upgraded interior and a sportier image. After a short 1996 production run the New Yorker was dropped in favor of a six- passenger option on the 1996-1997 LHS. The LHS received a minor face change in 1995 when the corporate wide pentastar emblem was replaced with the revived Chrysler brand emblem.

The effect can be used to store temporary, erasable holograms and is useful for holographic data storage. It can also be used to create a phase-conjugate mirror or an optical spatial soliton. Mechanism The photorefractive effect occurs in several stages: #A photorefractive material is illuminated by coherent beams of light. (In holography, these would be the signal and reference beams). Interference between the beams results in a pattern of dark and light fringes throughout the crystal. #In regions where a bright fringe is present, electrons can absorb the light and be photoexcited from an impurity level into the conduction band of the material, leaving an electron hole (a net positive charge). Impurity levels have an energy intermediate between the energies of the valence band and conduction band of the material. #Once in the conduction band, the electrons are free to move and diffuse throughout the crystal. Since the electrons are being excited preferentially in the bright fringes, the net electron diffusion current is towards the dark-fringe regions of the material. #While in the conduction band, the electrons may with some probability recombine with the holes and return to the impurity levels. The rate at which this recombination takes place determines how far the electrons diffuse, and thus the overall strength of the photorefractive effect in that material. Once back in the impurity level, the electrons are trapped and can no longer move unless re- excited back into the conduction band (by light). #With the net redistribution of electrons into the dark regions of the material, leaving holes in the bright areas, the resulting charge distribution causes an electric field, known as a space charge field to be set up in the crystal. Since the electrons and holes are trapped and immobile, the space charge field persists even when the illuminating beams are removed. #The internal space charge field, via the electro-optic effect, causes the refractive index of the crystal to change in the regions where the field is strongest. This causes a spatially varying refractive index grating to occur throughout the crystal. The pattern of the grating that is formed follows the light interference pattern originally imposed on the crystal. #The refractive index grating can now diffract light shone into the crystal, with the resulting diffraction pattern recreating the original pattern of light stored in the crystal. Application The photorefractive effect can be used for dynamic holography, and, in particular, for cleaning of coherent beams. For example, in the case of a hologram, illuminating the grating with just the reference beam causes the reconstruction of the original signal beam. When two coherent laser beams (usually obtained by splitting a laser beam by the use of a beamsplitter into two, and then suitably redirecting by mirrors) cross inside a photorefractive crystal, the resultant refractive index grating diffracts the laser beams. As a result, one beam gains energy and becomes more intense at the expense of light intensity reduction of the other. This phenomenon is an example of two- wave mixing. In this configuration, Bragg diffraction condition is automatically satisfied. The pattern stored inside the crystal persists until the pattern is erased; this can be done by flooding the crystal with uniform illumination which will excite the electrons back into the conduction band and allow them to be distributed more uniformly. Photorefractive materials include barium titanate (BaTiO3), lithium niobate (LiNbO3), vanadium doped zinc telluride (ZnTe:V), organic photorefractive materials, certain photopolymers, and some multiple quantum well structures.

Discovery and naming  The asteroid was discovered on 26 September 1983, by Swiss astronomer Paul Wild at Zimmerwald Observatory near Bern, Switzerland. It was named after the comic knight who is the eponymous hero of Cervantes Spanish novel Don Quixote (1605). The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 2 December 1990 ().  Orbit and characteristics  Don Quixote is characterized as a dark D-type asteroid in the Tholen and SMASS taxonomy. It has a highly inclined comet-like orbit of 31 degrees that leads to frequent perturbations by Jupiter. Don Quixote measures 18.4 kilometres in diameter and has a rotation period of 7.7 hours. Due to its comet-like orbit and albedo, Don Quixote has been suspected to be an extinct comet. However, infrared observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 4.5 Œºm revealed a faint coma and tail around the object. The cometary activity is inferred by carbon dioxide () molecular band emission. In March 2018 a tail was observed at visible wavelengths for the first time. It is still unknown whether the observed activity is persistent or an outburst, resulting from the excavation of sub-surface ice due to a recent impact of a smaller body.

The precursor of the agency that would become the Cipher Bureau was created in May 1919, during the Polish- Soviet War (1919‚Äì21), and played a vital role in securing Poland's survival and victory in that war. In mid-1931, the Cipher Bureau was formed by the merger of pre-existing agencies. In December 1932, the Bureau began breaking Germany's Enigma ciphers. Over the next seven years, Polish cryptologists overcame the growing structural and operating complexities of the plugboard- equipped Enigma. The Bureau also broke Soviet cryptography. Five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of French and British military intelligence, which had been unable to make any headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and- technology transfer would give the Allies an unprecedented advantage (Ultra) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of World War II. Precursor General Staff building (Saxon Palace), destroyed in World War II. In the photo, the arcade shelters the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, before which stands Thorvaldsen's equestrian statue of Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski. In this building, from 1932, the Cipher Bureau broke the German plugboard military Enigma. On 8 May 1919 Lt. J√≥zef Serafin Stanslicki established a Polish Army \\"Cipher Section\\" (Sekcja Szyfr√≥w), precursor to the \\"Cipher Bureau\\" (Biuro Szyfr√≥w). The Cipher Section reported to the Polish General Staff and contributed substantially to Poland's defense by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's forces during the Polish-Soviet War of 1919‚Äì21, thereby helping preserve Poland's independence, recently regained in the wake of World War I. The Cipher Section's purview included both ciphers and codes. In Polish the term \\"cipher\\" (\\"szyfr\\") loosely refers to both these two principal categories of cryptography. (Compare the opposite practice in English, which loosely refers to both codes and ciphers as \\"codes\\".) During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War (1919‚Äì1921), some one hundred Russian ciphers were broken by a sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who included army Lieutenant Jan Kowalewski and three world-famous professors of mathematics ‚Äî Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski and Stanis≈Çaw Le≈õniewski. Russian army staffs were still following the same disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had Tsarist army staffs during World War I, to the decisive advantage of their German enemy. As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their intentions and operational orders. The Soviet staffs, according to Polish Colonel Mieczys≈Çaw ≈öcie≈ºy≈Ñski, > \\"had not the slightest hesitation about sending any and all messages of an > operational nature by means of radiotelegraphy; there were periods during > the war when, for purposes of operational communications and for purposes of > command by higher staffs, no other means of communication whatever were > used, messages being transmitted either entirely (\\"in clear,\\" or plaintext) > or encrypted by means of such an incredibly uncomplicated system that for > our trained specialists reading the messages was child's play. The same held > for the chitchat of personnel at radiotelegraphic stations, where discipline > was disastrously lax.\\" In the crucial month of August 1920 alone, Polish cryptologists decrypted 410 signals: * from Soviet General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, commander of the northern front * from Leon Trotsky, Soviet commissar of war * from commanders of armies, for example:  the commander of the ,  the commander of the 1st Cavalry Army, Semyon Budionny  the commander of the , Gai * from the staffs of the XII, XV and XVI Armies * from the staffs of:  the Mozyr Group (named after the Belarusian city)  the Zolochiv Group (after the Ukrainian town)  the Yakir Group [after General Iona Emmanuilovich Yakir] * from the 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 24, 27, 41, 44, 45, 53, 54, 58 and 60 Infantry Divisions * from the 8 Cavalry Division etc. The intercepts were as a rule decrypted the same day, or at latest the next day, and were immediately sent to the Polish General Staff's Section II (Intelligence) and operational section. The more important signals were read in their entirety by the Chief of the General Staff, and even by the Commander in Chief, Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Interception and reading of the signals provided Polish intelligence with entire Russian operational orders. The Poles were able to follow the whole operation of Budionny's Cavalry Army in the second half of August 1920 with incredible precision, just by monitoring his radiotelegraphic correspondence with Tukhachevsky, including the famous and historic conflict between the two Russian commanders. The intercepts even included an order from Trotsky to the revolutionary council of war of the Western Front, confirming Tukhachevsky's operational orders, thus giving them the authority of the supreme chief of the Soviet armed forces. An entire operational order from Tukhachevsky to Budionny was intercepted on 19 August and read on 20 August, stating the tasks of all of Tukhachevsky's armies, of which only the essence had previously been known. ≈öcie≈ºy≈Ñski surmises that the Soviets must likewise have intercepted Polish operational signals; but he doubts that this would have availed them much, since Polish cryptography \\"stood abreast of modern cryptography\\" and since only a small number of Polish higher headquarters were equipped with radio stations, of which there was a great shortage; and finally, Polish headquarters were more cautious than the Russians and almost every Polish division had the use of a land line. Polish cryptologists enjoyed generous support under the command of Col. Tadeusz Schaetzel, chief of the Polish General Staff's Section II (Intelligence). They worked at Warsaw's radio station WAR, one of two Polish long-range radio transmitters at the time. The Polish cryptologists' work led, among many other things, to discovery of a large gap on the Red Army's left flank, which enabled Poland's Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski to drive a war-winning wedge into that gap during the August 1920 Battle of Warsaw. The discovery of the Cipher Bureau's archives, decades after the Polish-Soviet War, has borne out ≈öcie≈ºy≈Ñski's assertion Cipher Bureau In mid-1931, at the Polish General Staff, a Cipher Bureau was formed by merging the Radio-Intelligence Office (Referat Radiowywiadu) and the Polish-Cryptography Office (Referat Szyfr√≥w W≈Çasnych)., note 6 The Bureau was charged with both cryptography ‚Äî the generation, and supervision of the use, of ciphers and codes ‚Äî and cryptology, the study of ciphers and codes, particularly for the purpose of \\"breaking\\" them. Between 1932 and 1936, the Cipher Bureau took on additional responsibilities, including radio communications between military-intelligence posts in Poland and abroad, as well as radio counterintelligence ‚Äî mobile direction-finding and intercept stations for the locating and traffic-analysis of spy and fifth-column transmitters operating in Poland. Stalking Enigma The Enigma machine was an electro-mechanical rotor machine with a scrambler consisting of (from right to left) an entry drum, three rotors and a reflector. It was available commercially from the early 1920s and was modified for use by the German military who adopted it later in the decade. Marian Rejewski ca. 1932, when he first broke Enigma In late 1927 or early 1928, there arrived at the Warsaw Customs Office from Germany a package that, according to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment. The German firm's representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, as it had been shipped with other equipment by mistake. His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology. And since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample time to look into the matter. They carefully opened the box and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a cipher machine. They examined the machine minutely, then put it back into the box. The Bureau's leading Enigma cryptanalyst Marian Rejewski commented that the cipher machine may be surmised to have been a commercial- model Enigma, since at that time the military model had not yet been devised. \\"Hence this trivial episode was of no practical importance, though it does fix the date at which the Cipher Bureau's interest in the Enigma machine began\\"manifested, initially, in the entirely legal acquisition of a single commercial-model Enigma. On 15 July 1928 the first German machine-enciphered messages were broadcast by German military radio stations. Polish monitoring stations began intercepting them, and cryptologists in the Polish Cipher Bureau's German section were instructed to try to read them. The effort was fruitless, however, and was eventually abandoned. There remained very slight evidence of the effort, in the form of a few densely written-over sheets of paper and the commercial-model Enigma machine. On 15 January 1929 Major Gwido Langer, after a tour of duty as chief of staff of the 1st Legion Infantry Division, became chief of the Radio-Intelligence Office, and subsequently of the Cipher Bureau. The Bureau's deputy chief, and the chief of its German section (BS-4), was Captain Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki. In 1929, while the Cipher Bureau's predecessor agency was still headed by Major Franciszek Pokorny (a relative of the outstanding World War I Austro-Hungarian Army cryptologist, Captain Herman Pokorny), Ciƒô≈ºki, Franciszek Pokorny, and a civilian Bureau associate, Antoni Palluth, taught a secret cryptology course at Pozna≈Ñ University for selected mathematics students. Over ten years later, during World War II while in France, one of the students, Marian Rejewski, would discover that the entire course had been taught from French General Marcel Givi√®rge's book, Cours de cryptographie (Course of Cryptography), published in 1925. In September 1932, Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki hired three young graduates of the Pozna≈Ñ course to be Bureau staff members: Marian Rejewski, Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki and Henryk Zygalski. Successes and setbacks In 1926, the German Navy adopted, as its top cryptographic device, a modified civilian Enigma machine; in 1928 the German Army followed suit. The complexity of the system was much increased in 1930 by the introduction of a plugboard (Steckerbrett), albeit with only six connecting leads in use. In December 1932, Marian Rejewski made what historian David Kahn describes as one of the greatest advances in cryptologic history, by applying pure mathematicsthe theory of permutations and groupsto breaking the German armed forces' Enigma machine ciphers. Rejewski had worked out the precise interconnections of the Enigma rotors and reflector, after the Bureau had received, from French Military Intelligence Captain Gustave Bertrand, two German documents and two pages of Enigma daily keys (for September and October of that year). These had been obtained by a French military intelligence agent, a German codenamed Rex, from an agent who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, whom the French codenamed Asch√©. Cyclometer, devised in the mid-1930s by Rejewski to catalog the cycle structure of Enigma permutations. 1: Rotor lid closed, 2: Rotor lid open, 3: Rheostat, 4: Glowlamps, 5: Switches, 6: Letters. After Rejewski had worked out the military Enigma's logical structure, the Polish Cipher Bureau commissioned the AVA Radio Company, co-owned by Antoni Palluth, to build replicas (\\"doubles\\") of the Enigma to Rejewski's specifications. His method of decrypting Enigma messages exploited two weaknesses of the German operating procedures. It used what Rejewski called \\"characteristics\\" that were independent of the plugboard connections. This involved compiling a card catalog of certain features of the set of indicator settings.There were 26 √ó 26 √ó 26 = 17,576 possible rotor positions for each of the six rotor orders, giving a total of 105,456 possible indicators. The Germans increased the difficulty of decrypting Enigma messages by decreasing the interval between changes in the order of the rotors from quarterly, initially, to monthly in February 1936, then daily in October of that year, when they also increased the number of plugboard leads from six to a number that varied between five and eight. This made the Biuro's grill method much less easy, citing as it relied on unsteckered letter pairs. The German navy was more security- conscious than the army and air force, and in May 1937 it introduced a new, much more secure, indicator procedure that remained unbroken for several years. The next setback occurred in November 1937, when the scrambler's reflector was changed to one with different interconnections (known as Umkehrwalze-B). Rejewski worked out the wiring in the new reflector, but the catalog of characteristics had to be compiled anew, again using Rejewski's \\"cyclometer\\", which had been built to his specifications by the AVA Radio Company. In January 1938, Colonel Stefan Mayer directed that statistics be compiled for a two-week period, comparing the numbers of Enigma messages solved, to Enigma intercepts. The ratio came to 75 percent. \\"Nor,\\" Marian Rejewski has commented, \\"were those 75 percent ... the limit of our possibilities. With slightly augmented personnel, we might have attained about 90 percent ... read. But a certain amount of cipher material ... due to faulty transmission or ... reception, or to various other causes, always remains unread ...\\" Information obtained from Enigma decryption seems to have been directed from B.S.-4 principally to the German Office of the General Staff's Section II (Intelligence). There, from fall 1935 to mid-April 1939, it was worked up by Major Jan Le≈õniak, who in April 1939 would turn the German Office over to another officer and himself form a Situation Office intended for wartime service. He would head the Situation Office to and through the September 1939 Campaign. Zygalski perforated sheet (1938) The system of pre- defining the indicator setting for the day for all Enigma operators on a given network, on which the method of characteristics depended, was changed on 15 September 1938. The one exception to this was the network used by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD)‚Äîthe intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party‚Äîwho did not make the change until 1 July 1939. Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure procedure of sending the enciphered message key twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 perforated sheets, and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the bomba kryptologiczna (cryptologic bomb). Both the Zygalski-sheet method and each bomba worked for only a single scrambler rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced.Bomby is the plural of bomba. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day., citing This increased the number of possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten. When World War II broke out on 1 September 1939, Le≈õniak and his colleagues had been working intensively for two or three years to establish the German order of battle and had succeeded in working out nearly 95 percent of it. The German attack on Poland came as no surprise to the Polish General Staff. The results that had been obtained by Polish intelligence, according to Le≈õniak, \\"absolutely exceeded what would normally have been possible.\\" Kabaty Woods Until 1937 the Cipher Bureau's German section, BS-4, had been housed in the Polish General Staff building ‚Äî the stately 18th-century \\"Saxon Palace\\" ‚Äî in Warsaw. That year BS-4 moved into specially constructed new facilities in the Kabaty Woods near Pyry, south of Warsaw. There, working conditions were incomparably better than in the cramped quarters at the General Staff building. The move was dictated as well by requirements of security. Germany's Abwehr was always looking for potential traitors among the military and civilian workers at the General Staff building. Strolling agents, even if lacking access to the Staff building, could observe personnel entering and leaving, and photograph them with concealed miniature cameras. Annual Abwehr intelligence assignments for German agents in Warsaw placed a priority on securing informants at the Polish General Staff. Gift to allies It was in the Kabaty Woods, at Pyry, on 25 and 26 July 1939, with war looming, that, on instructions from the Polish General Staff, the Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki, the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. Stefan Mayer, chief of intelligence, revealed Poland's achievements to cryptanalytical representatives of France and Britain, explaining how they had broken Enigma. They undertook to give each country a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their equipment, including Zygalski sheets and Rejewski's cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. The French contingent consisted of Major Gustave Bertrand, the French radio-intelligence and cryptology chief, and Capt. Henri Braqueni√© of the French Air Force staff. The British sent Commander Alastair Denniston, head of Britain's Government Code and Cypher School, Dilly Knox, chief British cryptanalyst and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations.Ralph Erskine, \\"The Poles Reveal Their Secrets: Alastair Denniston's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry,\\" Cryptologia, vol. 30, no. 4 (2006), pp. 294‚Äì305. When Rejewski had been working on reconstructing the German military Enigma machine in late 1932, he had ultimately solved a crucial element, the wiring of the letters of the alphabet into the entry drum, with the inspired guess that they might be wired in simple alphabetical order. Now, at the trilateral meetingRejewski was later to recount\\"the first question that ... Dillwyn Knox asked was: 'What are the connections in the entry drum? Knox was mortified to learn how simple the answer was. The Poles' gift, to their western Allies, of Enigma decryption, five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, came not a moment too soon. Former Bletchley Park mathematician- cryptologist Gordon Welchman has written: \\"Ultra would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military ... Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.\\" Allied Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, at war's end, described intelligence from Bletchley Park as having been \\"of priceless value to me. It has simplified my task as a commander enormously.\\" Eisenhower expressed his thanks for this \\"decisive contribution to the Allied war effort.\\" Churchill's greatest wartime fear, even after Hitler had suspended Operation Sea Lion and invaded the Soviet Union, was that the German submarine wolfpacks would succeed in strangling sea-locked Britain.Winston Churchill, Their Finest Hour, pp. 598‚Äì600. A major factor that averted Britain's defeat in the Battle of the Atlantic was her regained mastery of Naval Enigma decryption; and while the latter benefited crucially from British seizure of German Enigma-equipped naval vessels, the breaking of German naval signals ultimately relied on techniques that had been pioneered by the Polish Cipher Bureau. Had Britain capitulated to Hitler, the United States would have been deprived of an essential forward base for its subsequent involvement in the European and North African theaters.Christopher Kasparek, review of Michael Alfred Peszke, The Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II, 2005, in The Polish Review, vol. L, no. 2, 2005, p. 240. A week after the Pyry meeting, Dillwyn Knox, in a letter dated 1 August 1939, thanked the Poles, in Polish, \\"for your cooperation and patience.\\" He enclosed little paper batons and a scarf picturing a Derby horse raceevidently emblematic of the cryptological race that Knox had hoped to win using the batons, and whose loss he was gallantly acknowledging. On 5 September 1939, as it became clear that Poland was unlikely to halt the ongoing German invasion, BS-4 received orders to destroy part of its files and evacuate essential personnel.

Photo taken before 30 August 1940, when the Germans concealed Thorvaldsen's statue of Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski. During the German Invasion of Poland in September 1939, key Cipher Bureau personnel were evacuated southeast and‚Äîafter the Soviets invaded eastern Poland on 17 September‚Äîinto Romania, on the way destroying their cryptological equipment and documentation. Eventually, crossing Yugoslavia and still-neutral Italy, they reached France. Some personnel of the Cipher Bureau's German section who had worked with Enigma, and most of the workers at the AVA Radio Company that had built Enigma doubles and cryptologic equipment for the German section, remained in Poland. Some were interrogated by the Gestapo, but no one gave away the secret of Polish mastery of Enigma decryption. At PC Bruno, outside Paris, on 20 October 1939 the Poles resumed work on German Enigma ciphers in close collaboration with Britain's Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. In the interest of security, the allied cryptological services, before sending their messages over a teleprinter line, encrypted them using Enigma doubles. Henri Braqueni√© often closed messages with a \\"Heil Hitler!\\" As late as December 1939, when Lt. Col. Gwido Langer, accompanied by Captain Braqueni√©, visited London and Bletchley Park, the British asked that the Polish cryptologists be turned over to them. Langer, however, took the position that the Polish team must remain where the Polish Armed Forces were being formedon French soil. The mathematicians might actually have reached Britain much earlierand much more comfortablythan they eventually did; but in September 1939, when they went to the British embassy in Bucharest, Romania, they were brushed off by a preoccupied British diplomat. In January 1940, the British cryptanalyst Alan Turing spent several days at PC Bruno conferring with his Polish colleagues. He had brought the Poles a full set of Zygalski sheets that had been produced at Bletchley Park by John Jeffreys using Polish- supplied information. On 17 January 1940, the Poles made the first break into wartime Enigma traffic‚Äîthat from 28 October 1939., note 8 During this period, until the collapse of France in June 1940, ultimately 83 percent of the Enigma keys that were found, were solved at Bletchley Park, the remaining 17 percent at PC Bruno. Rejewski commented: The inter-Allied cryptologic collaboration prevented duplication of effort and facilitated discoveries. Before fighting had started in Norway in April 1940, the Polish-French team solved an uncommonly hard three-letter code used by the Germans to communicate with fighter and bomber squadrons and for exchange of meteorological data between aircraft and land. The code had first appeared in December 1939, but the Polish cryptologists had been too preoccupied with Enigma to give the code much attention. With the German assault on the west impending, however, the breaking of the Luftwaffe code took on mounting urgency. The trail of the elusive code (whose system of letters changed every 24 hours) led back to Enigma. The first clue came from the British, who had noticed that the code's letters did not change randomly. If A changed to P, then elsewhere P was replaced by A. The British made no further headway, but the Poles realized that what was manifesting was Enigma's exclusivity principle that they had discovered in 1932. The Germans' carelessness meant that now the Poles, having after midnight solved Enigma's daily setting, could with no further effort also read the Luftwaffe signals. The Germans, just before opening their 10 May 1940 offensive in the west that would trample Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in order to reach the borders of France, once again changed their procedure for enciphering message keys, rendering the Zygalski sheets \\"completely useless\\" and temporarily defeating the joint British-Polish cryptologic attacks on Enigma. According to Gustave Bertrand, \\"It took superhuman day-and-night effort to overcome this new difficulty: on May 20, decryption resumed.\\"Bertrand (1973) pp. 88‚Äì89 Following the capitulation of France in June 1940, the Poles were evacuated to Algeria. On October 1, 1940, they resumed work at \\"Cadix\\", near Uz√®s in unoccupied southern, Vichy France, under the sponsorship of Gustave Bertrand. A little over two years later, on 8 November 1942, Bertrand learned from the BBC that the Allies had landed in French North Africa (\\"Operation Torch\\"). Knowing that in such an eventuality the Germans planned to occupy Vichy France, on 9 November he evacuated Cadix. Two days later, on 11 November, the Germans indeed marched into southern France. On the morning of 12 November they occupied Cadix. Over the two years since its establishment in October 1940, Cadix had decrypted thousands of Wehrmacht, SS and Gestapo messages, originating not only from French territory but from across Europe, which provided invaluable intelligence to Allied commands and resistance movements. Cadix had also decrypted thousands of Soviet messages. Having departed Cadix, the Polish personnel evaded the occupying Italian security police and German Gestapo and sought to escape France via Spain. Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki, Jan Grali≈Ñski and Piotr Smole≈Ñski had died in the January 1942 sinking, in the Mediterranean Sea, of a French passenger ship, the Lamorici√®re, in which they had been returning to southern France from a tour of duty in Algeria. Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski hiked over the Pyrenees with a guide (who robbed them at gunpoint) to the Spanish border, where they were arrested on January 30, 1943. They were incarcerated by the Spaniards for three months before being released, upon Red Cross intervention, on 4 May 1943. They then managed, by a circuitous land‚Äìsea‚Äìair route, to join the Polish Armed Forces in Britain, Rejewski and Zygalski were inducted into the Polish Army as privates (they would eventually be promoted to lieutenant) and put to work breaking German SS and SD hand ciphers at a Polish signals facility in Boxmoor. Because of their having been in occupied France, the British considered it too risky to invite them to work at Bletchley Park. Finally, with the end of the two mathematicians' cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. From nearly its inception in 1931 until war's end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under cryptonyms (PC Bruno and Cadix), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying out much the same tasks; now it was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would work again as cryptologists. In late 1946 Rejewski returned to his family in a devastated and politically altered Poland, to live there another 33 years until his death in February 1980. Zygalski would remain in England until his death in August 1978. Secret preserved Despite their travails, Rejewski and Zygalski had fared better than some of their colleagues. Cadix's Polish military chiefs, Langer and Ciƒô≈ºki, had also been captured by the Germans, as they tried to escape from France into Spain on the night of March 10‚Äì11, 1943 along with three other Poles: Antoni Palluth, Edward Fokczy≈Ñski and Kazimierz Gaca., note 4 The first two became prisoners of war; the other three were sent as slave labourers to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczy≈Ñski perished. Despite the varyingly dire circumstances in which they were held, none of them Stefan Mayer emphasizes betrayed the secret of Enigma's decryption, thus making it possible for the Allies to continue exploiting this vital intelligence resource. Before the war, Palluth, a lecturer in the 1929 secret Pozna≈Ñ University cryptology course, had been co-owner of AVA, which produced equipment for the Cipher Bureau, and knew many details of the decryption technology. In Warsaw, under German occupation, other Cipher Bureau workers were interrogated by German intelligence commissions, and some AVA workers were approached by German agents, but all kept silent about compromises to Enigma. In popular culture In 1967 the Polish military historian W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, in his book Bitwa o tajemnice (The Battle for Secrets), first revealed that the German Enigma had been broken by Polish cryptologists before World War II. Kozaczuk's disclosure came seven years before F.W. Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret (1974) changed conventional views of the history of the war. The 1979 Polish film Sekret Enigmy (The Enigma Secret) is a generally fair, if superficial, account of the Cipher Bureau's story. Twenty-two years later, the 2001 Hollywood film Enigma was criticized for its many historical inaccuracies, including omission of Poland's fundamental work in Enigma decryption.How Poles cracked Nazi Enigma secret, Laurence Peter, BBC News, 20 July 2009 See also * Ultra * Marian Rejewski * Tadeusz Pe≈Çczy≈Ñski * Polish School of Mathematics * History of Polish Intelligence Services * Wilfred Dunderdale NotesReferencesBibliography      Good, I.J., and Cipher A.

First observed in 1962, it was officially discovered on 7 December 1980, by Chinese astronomers at the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanking, China, and later named in honor of the discovering observatory. The V-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.9 hours.  Orbit and classification  Purple Mountain is a core member of the Vesta family (), a giant asteroid family of typically bright V-type asteroids. Vestian asteroids have a composition akin to cumulate eucrites (HED meteorites) and are thought to have originated deep within 4 Vesta's crust, possibly from the Rheasilvia crater, a large impact crater on its southern hemisphere near the South pole, formed as a result of a subcatastrophic collision. Vesta is the main belt's second-largest and second-most-massive body after . Based on osculating Keplerian orbital elements, the asteroid has also been classified as a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt. Purple Mountain orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.7 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,315 days; semi-major axis of 2.35 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory on December 1951, or 29 years prior to its official discovery observation. = Lost asteroid = Purple Mountain has been a lost minor planet. In November 1962, Purple Mountain was observed as at Goethe Link Observatory. A total of three additional observations were taken at Crimea‚ÄìNauchnij in 1969 and 1972, when it was designated as and , respectively, but was subsequently lost with no follow-up observations until its official discovery at Nanking in 1980.  Physical characteristics  Based on the Moving Object Catalog (MOC) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Purple Mountain is a common, stony S-type asteroid, with a sequential best-type taxonomy of SV. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) also assumes it to be a stony S-type. In the SMASS-I classification by Xu, the asteroid is a V-type. This agrees with its measured high albedo (see below) often seen among the core members of the Vesta family. In 2013, a spectroscopic analysis showed it to have a composition very similar to the cumulate eucrite meteorites, which also suggests that the basaltic asteroid has originated from the crust of 4 Vesta. = Rotation period = In June 2015, a rotational lightcurve of Purple Mountain was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at Texas A&M; University, using the SARA-telescopes of the Southeastern Association for Research and Astronomy consortium. The 0.9-meter SARA-North telescope is located at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona, while the 0.6-meter SARA-South telescope is hosted at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 5.857 hours with a brightness variation of 0.32 magnitude (). One month later, in July 2015, another period of 2.928 hours and an amplitude of 0.40 magnitude was measured at MIT's George R. Wallace Jr. Observatory (). The results are in good agreement, apart from the fact that the latter is an alternative, monomodal solution with half the period of the former. CALL adopts the longer, bimodal period solution as the better result in its Lightcurve Data Base, due to the lightcurve's distinct amplitude and the small phase angle of the first observation. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Purple Mountain measures 6.507 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.347, while CALL assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from the body's classification into the Flora family ‚Äì and consequently calculates a larger diameter of 7.82 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.7.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO), an astronomical observatory located in Nanking (Nanjing), China. Built in 1934, the observatory is known for its astrometric observations and for its numerous discoveries of small Solar System bodies. It has played an important role in developing modern Chinese astronomy. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 29 November 1993 ().

It may, for example, be created by a pore-forming protein or as a hole in synthetic materials such as silicon or graphene. When a nanopore is present in an electrically insulating membrane, it can be used as a single-molecule detector. It can be a biological protein channel in a high electrical resistance lipid bilayer, a pore in a solid-state membrane or a hybrid of these ‚Äì a protein channel set in a synthetic membrane. The detection principle is based on monitoring the ionic current passing through the nanopore as a voltage is applied across the membrane. When the nanopore is of molecular dimensions, passage of molecules (e.g., DNA) cause interruptions of the \\"open\\" current level, leading to a \\"translocation event\\" signal. The passage of RNA or single-stranded DNA molecules through the membrane-embedded alpha-hemolysin channel (1.5 nm diameter), for example, causes a ~90% blockage of the current (measured at 1 M KCl solution). It may be considered a Coulter counter for much smaller particles.  Types of Nanopores = Organic = * Nanopores may be formed by pore-forming proteins, typically a hollow core passing through a mushroom- shaped protein molecule. Examples of pore-forming proteins are alpha hemolysin, aerolysin, and MspA porin. In typical laboratory nanopore experiments, a single protein nanopore is inserted into a lipid bilayer membrane and single-channel electrophysiology measurements are taken. * Larger nanopores can be up to 20 nm in a diameter. These pores allow small molecules like oxygen, glucose and insulin to pass however they prevent large immune system molecules like immunoglobins from passing. As an example, rat pancreatic cells are microencapsulated, they receive nutrients and release insulin through nanopores being totally isolated from their neighboring environment i.e. foreign cells. This knowledge can help to replace nonfunctional islets of Langerhans cells in the pancreas (responsible for producing insulin), by harvested piglet cells. They can be implanted underneath the human skin without the need of immunosuppressants which put diabetic patients at a risk of infection. = Inorganic = * Solid-state nanopores are generally made in silicon compound membranes, one of the most common being silicon nitride. The second type of widely used solid-state nanopores are glass nanopores fabricated by laser-assisted pulling of glass capillary. Solid-state nanopores can be manufactured with several techniques including ion-beam sculpting and electron beams. * More recently, the use of graphene as a material for solid-state nanopore sensing has been explored. Another example of solid-state nanopores is a box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure. The BSG nanostructure is a multilayer system of parallel hollow nanochannels located along the surface and having quadrangular cross-section. The thickness of the channel walls is approximately equal to 1 nm. The typical width of channel facets makes about 25 nm. * Size-tunable elastomeric nanopores have been fabricated, allowing accurate measurement of nanoparticles as they occlude the flow of ionic current. This measurement methodology can be used to measure a wide range of particle types. In contrast to the limitations of solid-state pores, they allow for the optimisation of the resistance pulse magnitude relative to the background current by matching the pore-size closely to the particle-size. As detection occurs on a particle by particle basis, the true average and polydispersity distribution can be determined. Using this principle, the world's only commercial tunable nanopore-based particle detection system has been developed by Izon Science Ltd. The box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure can be used as a basis for building devices with changeable pore sizes.  Nanopore based sequencing  The observation that a passing strand of DNA containing different bases corresponds with shifts in current values has led to the development of nanopore sequencing Nanopore sequencing can occur with bacterial nanopores as mentioned in the above section as well as with the Nanopore sequencing device(s) created by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.  Monomer identification  From a fundamental standpoint, nucleotides from DNA or RNA are identified based on shifts in current as the strand is entering the pore. The approach that Oxford Nanopore Technologies uses for nanopore DNA sequencing labeled DNA sample is loaded to the flow cell within the nanopore. The DNA fragment is guided to the nanopore and commences the unfolding of the helix. As the unwound helix moves through the nanopore, it is correlated with a change in the current value which is measured in thousand times per second. Nanopore analysis software can take this alternating current value for each base detected, and obtain the resulting DNA sequence. Similarly with the usage of biological nanopores, as a constant voltage is applied to the system, the alternating current can be observed. As DNA, RNA or peptides enter the pore, shifts in the current can be observed through this system that are characteristic of the monomer being identified Ion current rectification (ICR) is an important phenomenon for nanopore. Ion current rectification can also be used as a drug sensor and be employed to investigate charge status in the polymer membrane.  Applications to Nanopore Sequencing  Apart from rapid DNA sequencing, other applications include separation of single stranded and double stranded DNA in solution, and the determination of length of polymers. At this stage, nanopores are making contributions to the understanding of polymer biophysics, single-molecule analysis of DNA-protein interactions, as well as peptide sequencing. When it comes to peptide sequencing bacterial nanopores like hemolysin, can be applied to both RNA, DNA and most recently protein sequencing. Such as when applied in a study in which peptides with the same Glycine-Proline-Proline repeat were synthesized, and then put through nanopore analysis , an accurate sequence was able to be attained. This can also be used to identify differences in stereochemistry of peptides based on intermolecular ionic interactions. Understanding this also contributes more data to understanding the sequence of the peptide fully in its environment. Usage of another bacterial derived nanopore, an aerolysin nanopore, has shown ability having shown similar ability in distinguishing residues within a peptide has also shown the ability to identify toxins present even in proclaimed ‚Äúvery pure‚Äù protein samples, while demonstrating stability over varying pH values. A limitation to the usage of bacterial nanopores would be that peptides as short as six residues were accurately detected, but with larger more negatively charged peptides resulted in more background signal that is not representative of the molecule.  Alternate applications  Since the discovery of track-etched technology in the late 1960s, filter membranes with needed diameter have found application potential in various fields including food safety, environmental pollution, biology, medicine, fuel cell, and chemistry. These track-etched membranes are typically made in polymer membrane through track-etching procedure, during which the polymer membrane is first irradiated by heavy ion beam to form tracks and then cylindrical pores or asymmetric pores are created along the track after wet etching. As important as fabrication of the filter membranes with proper diameters, characterizations and measurements of these materials are of the same paramount. Until now, a few of methods have been developed, which can be classified into the following categories according to the physical mechanisms they exploited: imaging methods such as scanning electron microscopy(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy(AFM); fluid transport such as bubble point and gas transport; fluid adsorptions such as nitrogen adsorption/desorption (BEH), mercury porosimetry, liquid-vapor equilibrium (BJH), gas-liquid equilibrium (permoporometry) and liquid-solid equilibrium (thermoporometry); electronic conductance; ultrasonic spectroscopy; and molecular transport. More recently, the use of light transmission technique as a method for nanopore size measurement has been proposed.

He ruled with his Agiad co-monarch Pausanias.Agis II from Livius.Org Life Agis succeeded his father Archidamus II in 427 BC, and reigned a little more than 26 years. In the summer of 426 BC, he led an army of Peloponnesians and their allies as far as the isthmus, with the intention of invading Attica; but they were deterred from advancing farther by a succession of earthquakes.Thucydides, iii. 89 In the spring of the following year he led an army into Attica, but ceased his advance fifteen days after he had entered Attica.Thucydides, iv. 2, 6 In 419 BC, the Argives, at the instigation of Alcibiades, attacked Epidaurus; and Agis with a large force from Lacedaemon set out and marched to the frontier city of Leuctra. No one, Thucydides tells us, knew the purpose of this expedition. It was probably to make a diversion in favour of Epidaurus.Connop Thirlwall, vol. iii. p. 342 At Leuctra the unfavourable outcome of various sacrifices deterred Agis from proceeding. He therefore led his troops back, and sent around a notice to the allies to be ready for an expedition at the end of the sacred month of the Carnean festival. When the Argives repeated their attack on Epidaurus, the Spartans again marched to the frontier town, Caryae, and again turned back, supposedly on account of the aspect of the victims. In the middle of the following summer of 418 BC the Epidaurians being still hard pressed by the Argives, the Lacedaemonians with their whole force and some allies, under the command of Agis, invaded Argolis. By a skilful manoeuvre he succeeded in intercepting the Argives, and posted his army advantageously between them and the city. But just as the battle was about to begin, the Argive generals Thrasyllus and Alciphron met with Agis and prevailed on him to conclude a truce for four months. Agis, without disclosing his motives, pulled his army back. On his return he was severely censured in Sparta for having thus thrown away the opportunity of reducing Argos, especially as the Argives had seized the opportunity afforded by his return and taken Orchomenus. It was proposed to pull down his house, and inflict on him a fine of 100,000 drachmas. But on his earnest entreaty they contented themselves with appointing a council of war, consisting of 10 Spartans, who needed to be present before he could lead an army out of the city.Thucydides v. 54, 57, &c.; Shortly afterwards they received intelligence from Tegea, that, if not promptly reinforced, the party favourable to Sparta in that city would be compelled to surrender. The Spartans immediately sent their whole force under the command of Agis. He restored stability at Tegea, and then marched to Mantineia. By turning the waters to flood the lands of Mantineia, he succeeded in drawing the army of the Mantineans and Athenians down to the level ground. A battle ensued, in which the Spartans were victorious. The Battle of Mantinea was reckoned one of the most important battles ever fought between the Grecian states.Thucydides v. 71‚Äì73 In 417 BC, when the news reached Sparta of the counter-revolution at Argos, in which the oligarchical and Spartan faction was overthrown, an army was sent there under Agis. He was unable to restore the defeated party, but he destroyed the long walls which the Argives had begun to extend down to the sea, and took Hysiae.Thucydides v. 83 In the spring of 413 BC, Agis entered Attica with a Peloponnesian army, and fortified Decelea;Thucydides vii. 19, 27 and in the winter of the same year, after the news of the disastrous fate of the Sicilian expedition had reached Greece, he marched northwards to levy contributions on the allies of Sparta, for the purpose of constructing a fleet. While at Decelea he acted largely independent of the Spartan government, and received embassies from the disaffected allies of the Athenians, as from the Boeotians and other allies of Sparta.Thucydides viii. 3, 5 He seems to have remained at Decelea until the end of the Peloponnesian War. In 411 BC, during the administration of the Four Hundred, he made an unsuccessful attempt on Athens itself.Thucydides viii. 71 Afterwards the focus of the Peloponnesian War shifted to Asia Minor, and Lysander assumed a greater role in the siege of Athens. After victory was secured, Agis voted to charge his Agiad co-monarch Pausanias with treason, but Pausanias was acquitted. In 401 BC, the command of the war against the notoriously disloyal Elis was entrusted to Agis, who in the third year compelled the Eleans to sue for peace, acknowledge the freedom of their Perioeci (Triphylians and others), and allow Spartans to take part in the Olympic Games and sacrifices. As he was returning from Delphi, where he had gone to consecrate a tenth of the spoil, he fell sick at Heraea in Arcadia, and died a few days after he reached Sparta.Xenophon, Hellenica iii. 2. ¬ß 21, &c.; 3\\\\. ¬ß 1‚Äì4 He was buried in Sparta, with unparalleled solemnity and pomp. Agis left a son, Leotychides. However, he was excluded from the throne, as there was some suspicion with regard to his legitimacy. A common legend states that while Alcibiades was in Sparta, Agis II suspected that Alcibiades had slept with his queen, Timaea (and that Alcidbiades had fathered Leotychides).Justin, v. 2Plutarch, Alcibiades 23 It was probably at the suggestion of Agis that orders were sent out to Astyochus to put him to death. Alcibiades, however, received warning (according to some accounts from Timaea herself), and evaded the Spartans.Thucydides viii. 12, 45Plutarch, Lysand. 22. Agesil. 3 However, others claim that, judging from the sources, Leotychides was a man at the time of Agis' death, and Alcibiades as his father was a later replacement for a now unknown lover.L. G.

It is located between the Arctic Cape to the north, the coast of Siberia to the south, the New Siberian Islands to the west and Cape Billings, close to Chukotka, and Wrangel Island to the east. This sea borders on the Laptev Sea to the west and the Chukchi Sea to the east. This sea is one of the least studied in the Arctic area. It is characterized by severe climate, low water salinity, and a scarcity of flora, fauna and human population, as well as shallow depths (mostly less than 50 m), slow sea currents, low tides (below 25 cm), frequent fogs, especially in summer, and an abundance of ice fields which fully melt only in August‚ÄìSeptember. The sea shores were inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous tribes of Yukaghirs, Chukchi and then Evens and Evenks, which were engaged in fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry. They were then absorbed by Yakuts and later by Russians. Major industrial activities in the area are mining and navigation within the Northern Sea Route; commercial fishing is poorly developed.

Because it is open towards the Arctic Ocean in the north, the main gulfs of the East Siberian Sea, like the Kolyma Bay, the Kolyma Gulf and the Chaunskaya Bay, are all located in its southern limits. There are no islands in the middle of the East Siberian Sea, but there are a few islands and island groups in its coastal waters, like Ayon Island and the Medvyezhi island group. The total area of the islands is only 80 km2.Allan R. Robinson, Kenneth H. Brink The Global Coastal Ocean: Regional Studies and Syntheses, Harvard University Press, 2005 pp.775‚Äì783 Some islands mostly consist of sand and ice and gradually erode. The total catchment area is 1,342,000 km2. Among the rivers flowing into the East Siberian Sea, the Indigirka, Alazeya, Chukochya, Kolyma, Rauchua, Chaun, and Pegtymel are the most important. Only a few rivers are navigable.National Geospatial-intelligence Agency Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 North Coast of Russia Enroute , pp. 137‚Äì143 The coastline of the sea is 3,016 km long. It makes large bends, sometimes stretching deep into the land, and has a rather different topography in the eastern and western parts. Fine bends are rare and occur only in the river deltas. The coastal section between the New Siberian Islands and the mouth of the Kolyma River is uniform, with low and slowly varying slopes. It extends landwards to the marshy tundra filled with numerous small lakes. In contrast, the coast to the east of the Kolyma River is mountainous, with steep cliffs. The underwater topography of the shelf that forms the seabed is a plain, sloping from southwest to northeast, covered in a mixture of silt, sand and stones and lacking significant depressions and elevations. About 70% of the sea is shallower than 50 m, with predominant depths of 20‚Äì25 m. North-east to the mouth of the Kolyma and Indigirka rivers, there are deep trenches on the seabed, which are attributed to the ancient river valleys, now submerged by the sea. The region of small depths in the western part forms the Novosibirsk shoal. The greatest depths of about 150 m are found in the north-eastern part of the sea.William Elliott Butler Northeast arctic passage (1978) , pp. 35‚Äì36 The East Siberian Sea is bound to the south by the East Siberian Lowland, an alluvial plain mainly composed of sediments of marine origin dating back to the time when the whole area was occupied by the Verkhoyansk Sea, an ancient sea at the edge of the Siberian Craton in the Permian period. As centuries went by, gradually, most of the area limiting the sea, as well as the contiguous Laptev Sea to the south became filled with the alluvial deposits of modern rivers.Sea basins and land of the East Siberian Lowland =Climate= The climate is polar and is influenced by the continent and Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In winter, it is mostly affected by the continent. South-westerly and southerly winds having the speeds of 6‚Äì7 m/s (15 mph, 25 km/h) bring cold air from Siberia, so the average temperature in January is approximately ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The weather is calm, clear and stable with occasional intrusions by cyclones. Atlantic cyclones increase the wind speed and air temperature whereas Pacific ones bring clouds, storms and blizzards. The winds blow from the north in summer; they are weak in June, strengthen to 6‚Äì7 m/s (15 mph, 25 km/h) in July and reach 10‚Äì15 m/s (33 mph, 50 km/h) in August, making the western part of the sea one of the most violent areas on the northern Russian coast. The southeastern part is however much calmer. Northerly winds result in the low average temperatures of 0‚Äì1 ¬∞C in the open sea and 2‚Äì3 ¬∞C on the coast in July. Skies are usually cloudy, with frequent drizzling rains or wet snow. Along the coasts, fogs occur 90‚Äì100 days per year, mostly in summer (68‚Äì75 days). Precipitation is low at 100‚Äì200 mm per year, but it is still larger than the evaporation volume. =Hydrology= Ice in the East Siberian Sea Sea ice retreat in the East Siberian Sea. Top: 15 June 2007, bottom: 27 July the same year.Sea Ice Retreat in the East Siberian Sea, NASA The continental runoff into the East Siberian Sea is relatively small at about 250 km3/year that makes only 10% of the total runoff in all the Arctic seas of Russia. The largest contribution is from the Kolyma River at 132 km3, followed by the Indigirka River at 59 km3. Most runoff (90%) occurs in summer; it is concentrated near the coast, owing to the weak river currents, and therefore does not significantly affect the sea hydrology. The water exchange between the neighboring seas is as follows. The annual outflow to the Laptev Sea, Chukchi Sea and Arctic Ocean is 3,240, 6,600 and 11,430 km3, respectively; while the respective inflow values are 3,240, 8,800 and 9,230 km3. The surface water temperature decreases from south to north. In winter it varies between ‚àí0.2 and 0.6 ¬∞C at the river deltas and from ‚àí1.7 to ‚àí1.8 ¬∞C in the northern sea part. In summer, it warms to 7‚Äì8 ¬∞C in the bays and inlets and to 2‚Äì3 ¬∞C in the ice-free sea zones. Surface water salinity increases from southwest to northeast. In winter and spring, it is 4‚Äì5‚Ä∞ (parts per thousand) near the deltas of the Kolyma and Indigirka rivers. It increases to 28‚Äì30‚Ä∞ in the sea centre, reaching 31‚Äì32‚Ä∞ at its northern outskirts. Salinity decreases in summer by some 5‚Ä∞ due to the snow melting. It also decreases by some 5‚Äì7‚Ä∞ from the sea bottom to the surface. There are constant currents at the sea surface directed from west to east. They are weak and thus can temporarily change direction due to the wind. The tides are semidiurnal (rising twice a day) with the amplitude between 5 and 25 cm. The tidal wave weakens toward the coast due to shallow waters. The sea level is maximal in summer, due to the river runoff, and in autumn due to the winds. It is the lowest in March‚ÄìApril, with the total annual fluctuations within about 70 cm. Winds bring storms with waves reaching 3‚Äì5 m in the western part whereas the eastern regions are relatively calm. The storms typically last 1‚Äì2 days in summer; they are more frequent in winter and may extend up to 3‚Äì5 days. The sea freezes over between October‚ÄìNovember and June‚ÄìJuly. The ice is continuous and stationary near the coast, reaching the thickness of 2 m by the end of winter; The thickness decreases from west to east. Further into the sea, the ice cover transforms into drifting ice having the thickness of 2‚Äì3 m. The southern winter winds shift this ice northwards, making polynyas near the sea centre. There are no icebergs in the sea. Ice melting typically starts around May, first around the delta of the major Kolyma River. In absence of industry, sea water is rather clean. Minor contaminations are found near the Novosibirsk and Wrangel islands (up to 80 ¬µg/L), due to occasional oil spills,S. Heileman and I. Belkin East Siberian Sea: LME #56 , NOAA.gov and in Chaunskaya Bay due to the local thermal power station and activities at the major port Pevek..rospriroda.ru (in Russian)Ecological assessment of pollution in the Russian Arctic region , Global International Waters Assessment Final Report Flora and fauna Flora and fauna are relatively scarce due to the harsh climate. The summer plankton bloom is short but intense, producing 5 million tonnes of plankton in August and September, whereas the annual production is 7 million tonnes. The nutrients in water are mostly provided by river discharges and coastal erosion. The plankton species are dominated by the Pacific species of copepods. The sea shores and icefields host ringed seals (Phoca hispida), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) and walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) along with their predator, polar bear (Ursus maritimus). Birds include seagulls, uria and cormorants. Sea waters are often visited by bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhal (Monodon monoceros). Major fish species are grayling and Coregonus (whitefishes), such as muksun (Coregonus muksun), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and omul (Coregonus autumnalis). Also common are polar smelt, saffron cod, polar cod, flounder and Arctic char.Mammals of the East Siberian Sea (in Russian) History The coast of the East Siberian Sea was inhabited for ages by the native peoples of northern Siberia such as Yukaghirs and Chukchi (eastern areas). Those tribes were engaged in fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry, as reindeer sleds were essential for transportation and hunting. They were joined and absorbed by Evens and Evenks around the 2nd century and later, between 9th and 15th centuries, by much more numerous Yakuts. All those tribes moved north from the Baikal Lake area avoiding confrontations with Mongols. Whereas they all practised shamanism, they spoke different languages.Yukaghirs, Great Soviet Encyclopedia (in Russian)Evenks, Great Soviet Encyclopedia (in Russian)Bella Bychkova Jordan, Terry G. Jordan-Bychkov Siberian Village: Land and Life in the Sakha Republic, U of Minnesota Press, 2001 p. 38Evens , Novosibirsk University (in Russian) The sea was navigated by Russian sea-farers, moving from one river mouth to another in their kochs as early as the 17th century. In 1648, Semyon Dezhnev and Fedot Alekseev sailed the coast of the East Siberian Sea from the Kolyma to river Anadyr in the Bering Sea. Systematic exploration and mapping of the sea and its coasts was carried out by a series of expeditions in 1735‚Äì42, 1820‚Äì24, 1822, 1909 and 1911‚Äì14. In the 1930s, the coastal settlement of Ambarchik, located at the delta of the Kolyma River, was used as a transient labor camp from which prisoners were transported to other northern camps of the Gulag system. While stationed at Ambarchik, prisoners were employed to build most of the port infrastructure and to unload the incoming ships. Later, due to shallow waters, the shipping was gradually transferred to Chersky in the lower reaches of the Kolyma, in order to accommodate larger vessels. As a result of this transfer, the port and settlement have been abandoned. Nowadays, Ambarchik only hosts a meteorological station operated by a few staff members.–ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –≤ –ø–µ—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç—ã–π –ê–º–±–∞—Ä—á–∏–∫, SakhaNews (in Russian) Another two labour camps of the Gulag system were later opened near Pevek, namely Chaunlag (1951‚Äì1953) and Chaunchukotlag (1949‚Äì1957).

The coastal settlements are few and small, with the typical population below 100. The only city is Pevek (population 5,206), which is the northernmost city in Russia. There are gold mines near Leningradsky and Pevek, but many mines have been closed recently, for example, tin mines at Pevek in the 1990s, that resulted in outflow of population.Pevek (in Russian) So, the Logashkino settlement, which used to be a notable East Siberian Sea port, was abolished in 1998.Resolution #443 of September 29, 1998 On Exclusion of Inhabited Localities from the Records of Administrative and Territorial Division of the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic The sea is used mostly for transportation of goods across the northern coast of Russia during August‚ÄìSeptember. The navigation is hindered even in summer by the remaining floating ice which is also brought down to the southern shores by occasional winds. Fishery and hunting of marine animals is still practised as traditional activities, but has only local importance. Fishery mostly targets salmon, halibut and crab. Data exist on fish production, which in 2005 was distributed, in thousand tonnes as follows: sardine (1.6), Arctic cisco (1.8), Bering cisco (2.2), broad whitefish (2.7), Muksun (2.8) and others (3.6). The principal port is Pevek (in the Chaunskaya Bay)Ports and navigation (in Russian) After the breakup of the Soviet Union, commercial navigation in the Arctic went into decline. Nowadays more or less regular shipping occurs only between Pevek and Vladivostok. Ports in the northern Siberian coast located between Dudinka and Pevek see next to no shipping at all. Since 1944, most electricity for the region is provided by the 30 MW thermal power station of Pevek. It is ageing and consumes much oil which has to be brought from far away. Therefore, there was a project to replace the station by a floating 70 MW atomic power station by 2015.

Sylvius Leopold Weiss (12 October 168716 October 1750) was a German composer and lutenist. Born in Grottkau near Breslau, the son of Johann Jacob Weiss, also a lutenist, he served at courts in Breslau, Rome, and Dresden, where he died. Until recently, he was thought to have been born in 1686, but recent evidence suggests that he was in fact born the following year.Frank Legl, Zwischen Grottkau und Neuburg ‚Äì Neues zur Biographie von Silvius Leopold Weiss. Jahrbuch der Deutschen Lautengesellschaft IV, 2000, S. 1‚Äì40 Weiss was one of the most important and most prolific composers of lute music in history and one of the best-known and most technically accomplished lutenists of his day. He was a teacher to Philip Hyacinth, 4th Prince Lobkowicz, and the prince's second wife Anna Wilhelmina Althan. In later life, Weiss became a friend of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach and met J.S. Bach through him. Bach and Weiss were said to have competed in improvisation, as the following account by Johann Friedrich Reichardt describes: \\"Anyone who knows how difficult it is to play harmonic modulations and good counterpoint on the lute will be surprised and full of disbelief to hear from eyewitnesses that Weiss, the great lutenist, challenged J.S. Bach, the great harpsichordist and organist, at playing fantasies and fugues.\\" Sylvius Weiss's son Johann Adolph Faustinus Weiss succeeded him as a Saxon court lutenist. Works Weiss probably wrote more than 1000 pieces for lute,Breitkopf catalogue of 1769 includes incipits of 66 partitas by S.L.Weiss, from which 34 are lost, which consisted of about 200 pieces total - Michel Cardin - The London Manuscript unveiled: General context, pp. 4,6 from which about 850 attributed pieces survived, most of them grouped into 'sonatas' (not to be confused with the later classical sonata, based on sonata form) or suites, which consist mostly of baroque dance pieces.

Estes, 2014, Super-heavy Tanks of World War II, Osprey Publishing 48 pp developed during World War I but not deployed until after the war. It was, in physical dimensions, the largest operational tank ever made. Development=The Char d'assaut de grand mod√®le= The origins of the Char 2C have always been shrouded in a certain mystery. In the summer of 1916, probably in July,Guy Fran√ßois, 2011, \\"Le char lourd FCM 1A, ou le r√™ve immol√©\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel, 98: 42-51 General L√©on Augustin Jean Marie Mourret, the Subsecretary of Artillery, verbally granted Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e (FCM), a shipyard in the south of France near Toulon, the contract for the development of a heavy tank, a char d'assaut de grand mod√®le. At the time, French industry was very active in lobbying for defence orders, using their connections with high-placed officials and officers to obtain commissions; development contracts could be very profitable even when not resulting in actual production, as they were fully paid for by the state. The French Army had no stated requirement for a heavy tank, and there was no official policy to procure one, so the decision seems to have been taken solely on his personal authority. The reason he later gave was that the British tanks then in development by a naval committee seemed to be better devised as regarded lay-out, ventilation and fire protection, so a shipyard might improve on existing French designs. Exact specifications, if they ever existed, have been lost. FCM then largely neglected the project, apart from reaping the financial benefits. At that time all tank projects were highly secret, and thereby shielded from public scrutiny. On 15 September 1916 the British introduced the Mark I tank in the Battle of the Somme, and a veritable tank euphoria followed. When the public mood in Britain had been growing ever darker as the truth of the failure of the Somme Offensive could no longer be suppressed, tanks offered a new hope of final victory. The French people now became curious as to the state of their own national tank projects. French politicians, not having been greatly involved in them and leaving the matter to the military, were no less inquisitive. This sudden attention greatly alarmed Mourret, who promptly investigated the progress that had been made at FCM and was shocked to find there was none. On 30 September he personally took control of the project. On 12 October, knowing that the Renault company had some months earlier made several proposals to build a heavy tracked mortar which had been rejected, he begged Louis Renault to assist FCM in the development of a suitable heavy vehicle; this request Renault obliged. Even before knowing what the exact nature of the project would be, on 20 October Mourret ordered one prototype to be built by FCM. This development coincided with a political demand by Minister of Armament Albert Thomas to produce a tank superior to the British types. On 7 October he had requested Lloyd George to deliver some Mark Is to France but had received no answer. Correctly concluding that no such deliveries would materialise, on 23 January 1917 he ordered that French tanks should be developed that were faster, and more powerfully armed and armoured than any British vehicle. He specified a weight of forty tonnes, an immunity against light artillery rounds and a trench-crossing capacity of 3.5 metres. Meanwhile, Renault had consulted his own team, led by Rodolphe Ernst- Metzmaier, which since May 1916 had been in the process of designing the revolutionary Renault FT light tank. This work had not, however, stopped them from considering other tank types. Renault, always expecting his employees to provide new ideas instantly, had by this attitude encouraged the team to take a proactive stance ‚Äì setting a pattern that would last until 1940 ‚Äì and to have various kinds of contingency studies ready for the occasion, including a feasibility study for a heavy tank. This fortunate circumstance allowed a full-size wooden mock-up to be constructed in a remarkably quick time. It was visited by the Subsecretary of State of Inventions Jules-Louis Breton on 13 January 1917, who was much impressed and developed a keen interest in the project. The design was presented to the Consultative Committee of the Assault Artillery on 16 and 17 January 1917, after the basic concept had been approved on 30 December. This proposed tank was the most advanced design of its time; it was received very favourably, also because of the enthusiastic report by Breton, and a consensus began to form that the project was most promising and a potential \\"war-winner\\". It featured a 105 mm gun in a turret, had a proposed weight of 38 tons and 35 mm armour. The committee decided to have two prototypes developed, one with an electrical transmission, the other with a hydraulic transmission. In this period both the French and the British military had become aware of severe mobility and steering problems with heavy tracked vehicles; the French designs paralleled extensive British experiments with all kinds of improved tank transmissions to solve them. =Resistance to the project= In January 1917, the Ministry of Armament proposed to build three weight classes of tanks: light, medium and heavy tanks, the latter class corresponding to the new project. However, the FCM tank had already made a powerful and influential enemy. Brigadier Jean Baptiste Eug√®ne Estienne, commander of the new tank force, the Assault Artillery, closely cooperated with Renault in the development of the Renault FT, and through this connection was kept well informed of the other tank project. Estienne began to fear that the production of the heavy vehicle would use up all available production facilities, making the procurement of the much more practical Renault FT light tank impossible. He was not averse to the production of heavy tanks as such but only in a limited number and on the condition it did not impede the manufacture of light tanks. That his fears were not unfounded became apparent when in November Mourret tried to obstruct further development of the Renault FT, arguing that all available resources should be concentrated into heavy tank production. Alarmed, Estienne now wrote a letter to the Commander-in- Chief, General Joffre, dated 27 November 1916 and defending the light tank concept. In it he admitted that \\"colossal landships\\" might in certain circumstances have their uses, but pointed out that while it was as yet unproven that any workable heavy type could actually be developed, let alone produced in sufficient numbers by the French industry, it would be folly not to give priority to light tanks that could be constructed without delay. He insisted that Joffre use all his influence to bring about the cancellation of the heavy tank project. Joffre answered that Estienne was no doubt correct in his tactical and organisational analysis, but that he could not oblige him because political backing of the heavy tank was simply too strong. The Minister of Armament, Albert Thomas, had committed himself too openly to Mourret's cause and did not dare to retract support now. Joffre advised Estienne not to worry too much; he would make sure at least that the Renault FT would not be cancelled, and precisely because heavy tank development would take such a long time, for the immediate future it would not get in the way of light tank production. There would surely be no harm in allowing some prototypes to be built. The Consultative Committee of the Assault Artillery (Comit√© Consultatif de l'Artillerie d'Assaut or CCAS) had been created on 13 December 1916 and for the first time met on 17 December. During this first session it was reported that Renault and FCM were cooperating in a heavy tank project of thirty tonnes. Estienne on this occasion stressed that production should be \\"orientated towards small types and very large types\\". During the next meeting on 30 December, Estienne was surprised to discover that for no clear reasons a 105 mm gun was planned. He himself preferred a 75 mm gun. Estienne was absent on the crucial meeting of 17 January, but by letter informed the committee that he found the project well-presented and satisfactory and agreed with the quick construction of two prototypes; he stated his preference for a 75 mm over a 105 mm gun. In December Joffre was replaced as supreme commander by Robert Nivelle. In late January Nivelle learned of the heavy tank project from Estienne. He was much more alarmed than Joffre had been. On 29 January he wrote a letter to Minister Thomas, making clear that under no circumstances could the project be allowed to impede production of the Schneider CA. Thomas answered on 5 February that there was no danger of this; anyway he had just happened to affirm on 1 February the policy of General Mourret, who had already ordered the simultaneous development of three prototypes: the lightened \\"A\\" version, weighing thirty tons, having a length of 6.92 metres, with a suspension featuring twenty-nine double road wheels, four main bogies and five top rollers, powered by two Renault 200 hp engines and to be equipped with a 75 mm gun, to fulfil the original order of 20 October; the \\"B\\" version of forty-five tons with a hull lengthened to 7.39 metres, armed with a 75 mm gun and two machine guns, with a suspension featuring thirty road wheels, five main bogies and six top rollers, using a new 380 hp engine and a petro-hydraulic transmission and the \\"C\\" version of 62 tons with a 75 mm gun, a length of 9.31 meters, a suspension featuring forty-five road wheels, six main bogies and nine top rollers, and four engines of 110 hp combined with a petro-electrical transmission. Nivelle's misgivings were reinforced by inquiries from a parliamentary financial commission led by Pierre Renaudel. A plan by Breton to immediately order fifty vehicles more or less identical to the mock-up was therefore rejected. The 1 February order of two additional prototypes was confirmed by the CCAS on 7 February. Eventually the \\"FCM 1A\\" would be developed with a 105 mm gun and the \\"FCM 1B\\" would use a petrol-mechanical transmission. At first, progress with the FCM 1A prototype was satisfactory. FCM director Moritz was assured by Renault in January 1917 that the desired 200 HP engines were reliable and would pose no danger to the project. Moritz then predicted that the first prototype would be ready by 1 May 1917. On 10 April 1917 he still assumed that the first trials could have begun within five weeks. On 16 April the Nivelle Offensive failed completely, and the first use of French tanks was likewise a failure; in reaction Thomas ordered all tank production and projects to be ended. This led to an emergency alliance between Estienne and Mourret to bring about a reversal of this decision. When Thomas happened to visit Russia, Mourret surreptitiously ordered a restart of the tank projects. On his return an enraged Thomas caused Mourret to be fired, thus removing Estienne's greatest rival. Meanwhile, there were unexplained delays in the delivery of the engines and the gearbox by Renault. On 5 June, FCM could only take note that the promised pieces had not arrived yet. On 24 June the ministry of armament complained about the situation. On 13 August Breton personally inquired with Renault and was informed it would take at least another three weeks. A possible explanation of the delays might be a deliberate decision by Renault to give priority to other projects. During a meeting of the CCAS on 18 October, Moritz could at last announce that trials could begin on 20 November. In that meeting Estienne was critical of heavy tanks: \\"the infantry has as much need of large tanks, as it needs 400 mm cannon; it has need of small tanks, as much as it needs 37 mm and machine- guns\\". =The FCM 1A= On 17 November, director Moritz, introducing to the CCAS the forthcoming presentation of the FCM 1A prototype, explained it was a test bed that did not exactly correspond to the original \\"A version\\" specifications. In fact the company, in its efforts to get an actual running vehicle ready as soon as possible, had built a prototype that was largely based on the original mock-up and thus was much closer to the \\"B\\"-concept, albeit with a 105 mm gun and a petrol-mechanical transmission; the hydraulic transmission had been abandoned by the CCAS on 10 May. A detailed army report on the plans of January 1917 survives that can give a good impression of the qualities of the eventual prototype. The vehicle was the largest tank built until that date. It had a length of 8.35 m (27.4 ft), a width of 2.842 m (9.32 ft), a hull height of 1.98 m (6.5 ft), a turret roof height of 2.785 m (9.14 ft) and a total height, cupola included, of 3 m (9.84 ft). It was also the first tank vehicle that offered a real protection against artillery HE rounds: the front hull was covered by 35 mm (1.38 in) armour plate; the same was the all-around thickness of the turret. The sides and rear were protected by 21 mm (0.83 in) plate, the top and roof by 15 mm (0.6 in). The total weight of the tank was 41.4 tonnes. Its empty hulk weight was 22.1 tonnes, 17.5 tonnes accounted for by the hull, of which 5.5 tonnes of armour, and 4.6 tonnes by the turret, including 1.3 tonnes of armour. The hull of the FCM 1A was very elongated, in order to cross wide trenches. It was more or less compartmentalised into four sections, that however were not separated by bulkheads: a relatively short driver compartment at the front, a fighting compartment with a turret at its top, a larger munitions room and finally a large engine compartment at the rear. The last was enlarged at both sides over the tracks, to create room for long rectangular fuel tanks. The front of the hull followed the profile of the tall climbing faces of the tracks and therefore gradually curved upwards, ending in a high, vertical, nose plate. The glacis plate behind it was oriented almost horizontally and connected at its rear to the vertical top front plate of the driver compartment. As the turret ring was larger than the width of the hull, it partly rested on rounded lateral extensions. The turret was a truncated cone with a roof sloping down to the front, so that in side view its profile was wedge-shaped. =Crew= Originally a crew of seven had been planned, but in December 1917 this had been reduced to six: a commander in the left of the turret who also had the responsibility of aiming the gun; a second man in the right of the turret who combined the functions of gunner, machine-gunner and loader; a standing assistant-loader handing new rounds to the loader ‚Äì at first two of these had been seen as necessary; a driver; a front machine-gunner; and a mechanic who doubled as a rear machine-gunner. =Armament= The main armament was a 105 mm gun, a Canon de 105 Court Schneider, shortened to reduce its recoil to fit into a turret. It fired a HE shell with four kilogrammes of explosives and a muzzle velocity of 240 m/s. The large hull allowed for a large ammunition stock of 122 rounds: eighteen, stacked in three vertical rows of six in front of him, were directly accessible to the gunner/loader; two batches of eight were stowed below the fighting compartment floor and forty-four, stacked in four vertical rows of eleven, lined each wall of the ammunition room. The commander pointed the gun by observing the target through a vane sight, fitted on the turret roof, from his rectangular \\"cupola\\". There were two Hotchkiss 8 mm machine-guns in fixed ball-mount positions; reserve machine-guns or pistols could be fired through five vertical slits that could be plugged: one at the rear of the turret, two at the turret sides and two at the hull sides below the turret rear. =Driveline and suspension= In the prototype a single Renault 220 HP twelve cylinder engine was installed, allowing a maximum speed of 10 km/h (6.2 mph) at 1200 rpm. The minimum speed was 2 km/h (1.24 mph). The transmission was mechanical, using a disc clutch. The sprocket was at the rear, the idler at the front. The suspension consisted of bogies, sprung by leaf springs, of four wheels each with alternating external and internal flanges. The tracks were 600 mm (23.6 in) wide, resulting in a ground pressure of 0.6 kg/cm2. Ground clearance was 400 mm (15.7 in). The centre of gravity was in the middle of the vehicle, at a level of one metre above the ground. The design deliberately featured no overhanging front or rear sections, which had greatly hampered the mobility of the earlier French Schneider CA1 and Saint Chamond tanks. The tank could overcome a 1 m (3.3 ft) high vertical obstacle and cross a trench 3.5 m (11.5 ft) wide. =Ergonomics= Mourret's stated motive in having the tank designed by a shipyard ensured much attention was given to ergonomics. The vehicle was thus less cramped than earlier designs, the crew could walk, slightly crouching, throughout the hull. The mechanic could access the engine from both sides and the commander could communicate with the driver, the front machine-gunner and the mechanic via speaking tubes. External communications were the responsibility of the mechanic who could open a little hatch just behind the turret to give signals by flags, flares or electrical lights. The tank could be entered through the cupola, but each member had oval or round escape hatches above or below him. =The Char 2C is ordered= Berry in 1928 On 20 December 1917 the first prototype was ready to be shown to an investigating commission of the CCAS, with actual trials being held at La Seyne-sur-Mer on 21 and 22 December. Mourret had been replaced as head of the commission by Estienne; British and American observers were present. The FCM 1A, with its futuristic appearance, made an excellent impression on those present. Moritz demonstrated that the vehicle was effortlessly capable of crossing 3.5 metres wide trenches, climb ninety centimetres high walls and descend into, and climb out of again, six metres wide and four metres deep craters. In woods, it could break a 28 centimetres thick pine tree and run over a 35 centimetres thick one. A speed of 6 km/h was attained. The main problem was that it proved difficult to steer the tank due to its extreme track length and insufficient chain link profile. The track would easily slip when braked, though it was on no occasion thrown. The aircraft engine tended to overheat and its basic lack of power resulted in a maximum 65% climbing slope. Though the first shortened 105 mm Schneider cannon had been received in October, the first live firing tests were only held on 5 and 7 February 1918, with satisfactory results. Discussing the results of the trials, on 4 January 1918 the technical department of the Artillerie Sp√©ciale concluded that the FCM 1A seemed a powerful combat vehicle capable of having an important negative effect on enemy morale. Already on 30 December, minister of munitions Louis Loucheur had thought that France \\"hadn't a minute to lose\\" and suggested to Pr√©sident du Conseil Georges Clemenceau to spend fifty million French francs to construct a hundred FCM 1As, the first fifteen to be delivered from July 1918 onwards, in order to have a strength of eighty vehicles on 31 December. However, Clemenceau would leave the decision to Estienne. General Philippe P√©tain, the new High Commander of the French Army, asked Estienne to use his position to end the project. Estienne told P√©tain that this was ill-advised while the public was questioning why these heavy tanks had not been produced. Besides, the allies (specifically the British and the US) would only consent to give France 700 of the new Mark VIII Liberty design if France had made at least a token effort to produce its own heavy tanks. Thus the French authorities had to delay the project while outwardly endorsing it. Estienne had already set this course by choosing the heaviest version, the \\"C\\", for production, requiring a completely new prototype, causing a considerable delay. Then P√©tain demanded unreasonably high production numbers, thus delaying planning and initiating a political row. P√©tain asked for 300 heavy tanks to be ready by March 1919, causing a quarrel to erupt between Clemenceau, who was both Prime-Minister and Minister of War, and Loucheur, the Minister of Armament, who felt it was impossible to provide the labour and steel required. Meanwhile, Estienne and P√©tain complicated the issue with further demands. P√©tain asked for special pontoons, and Estienne demanded battering rams and electronic mine detectors to be fixed. When the war ended, not a single tank had been built. At first, the production order for the Char 2C was cancelled. Despite the end of hostilities, however, strong political pressure to adopt new heavy tank projects remained, as there was now a considerable surplus capacity in the heavy industry. To stop this, the Direction de l‚ÄôArtillerie d‚ÄôAssaut on instigation of Estienne decided in April 1919 to procure ten Char 2Cs after all, and use this as an argument to reject any other projects. This was not completely successful; as late as 1920 it was proposed to the Section Technique des Appareils de Combat to build a 600-tonne tank with 250 mm armour.Paul Malmassari, 2013, \\"Les Maxi-Chars au-del√† du Char Lourd, 1re partie ‚Äì 1916-1927: Du char de rupture au char de forteresse\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel 106: 39-48 At FCM Jammy and Savatier finished the Char 2C prototype, the other nine tanks being built almost simultaneously; all ten were delivered in 1921 and modified by the factory until 1923. They would be the last French tanks to be produced for the home market till the Char D1 pre-series of 1931. Description The Char 2C is the only super-heavy tank ever to attain operational status ‚Äì a super-heavy tank is not simply a tank that is very heavy but one that has been deliberately made much heavier than regular tanks of its period. The next operational tank to approach its weight would be the German Tiger II heavy tank of World War II. The Char 2C had a loaded weight of 69 tonnes, partly because of its armour, which was among the thickest of World War I-era tanks, but mostly because of its huge size. It is still easily the largest tank ever taken into production. With the tail fitted, the hull was over twelve metres long. Without tail, the hull length was 10.372 metres, the width 2.95 metres, the height 3.8 metres.Mayet (1996), p. 17 Adding the cupola, normally detached for transport, brought height to 408 centimetres. The armour thickness was 30 mm at the front, 22 mm at the sides, 13 mm at the top and 10 mm at the bottom. In 1930 and 1931, the vehicles were rebuilt with a frontal armour of forty-five millimetres.Fran√ßois Vauvillier, 2012, \\"Tous le Blind√©s de l'Arm√©e fran√ßaise. 1914-1940\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel 100, p. 27 Within its ample frame there was room for two fighting compartments. The forward compartment was crowned by a three- man turret ‚Äì the first such in history ‚Äì mounting a shortened 75 mm field gun of the Canon de 75 Mod√®le 1897 type, with 124 rounds and a muzzle velocity of 550 m/s, and the second, at the rear of the tank, was topped by a machine-gun turret armed with a Hotchkiss 8 mm. The front turret, made of 35 mm plates, was placed so high that its crew had to climb into it by means of a ladder, sitting on seats suspended from the turret roof and operating on an elevated level compared to the hull machine gunners below. The rear turret was made of 22 millimetre plates. Both turrets had stroboscopic cupolas. The three independent 8 mm machine gun positions, one at each side and one to the right of the driver at the front, all in ballmounts, gave protection against infantry assault. The machineguns had an ammunition load of 9504 rounds. The fighting compartments were connected by the engine room. In the design four engines had been planned but this was reduced to two, each track being powered by its own engine via an electrical transmission. The first engines were of the Chenu type, of 210 hp each. In 1923, these were replaced by captured German 6 cylinder 200 hp Mercedes engines allowing for a top speed of twelve kilometres per hour. These original engines wore down quickly and were eventually in turn replaced by two 250 hp Maybach engines, 16,950 cc, which rendered a maximum speed of 15 km/h. Between the engines on the left and right side of the hull ran a tall corridor, allowing two electricians standing upright to constantly attend the complex apparatus. Seven fuel tanks, four to the left and three to the right, containing 1,260 litres, gave it a range of 150 kilometres. The suspension contained thirty-nine interleaving road wheels on each side, making for a total of ninety wheels on the tank. Designed to negotiate the challenging terrain of trench warfare, the type had in principle excellent mobility. The Char 2C could cross a trench 425 centimetres wide, enough to pass the typical canal sluices in northern France. A vertical obstacle could be climbed of 170 centimetres and a slope of 70%. The wading capacity was 140 centimetres. Ground clearance was sixty centimetres. The axle track, measured between the inner track sides, was 225 centimetres. To man the tank required a crew of twelve: driver, commander, gunner, loader, four machine gunners, mechanic, electrician, assistant-electrician/mechanic and a radio operator. Some sources report thirteen, probably due to pictures of the crews that included the company commander. The assistant-mechanic was seated to the front right of the rear fighting compartment, on top of an escape hatch, and the radio operator was seated at the front left.Mayet (1996), p. 29 Operational history Champagne after capture by German forces in eastern France, June 1940 Lorraine in summer 1940 The ten tanks were part of several consecutive units, their organic strength at one time reduced to three. Their military value slowly decreased as more advanced tanks were developed throughout the 1920s and 1930s. By the end of the 1930s they were largely obsolete, because their slow speed and high-profile made them vulnerable to advances in anti-tank guns. Nevertheless, during the French mobilisation of 1939, all ten were activated and put into their own unit, the 51st Bataillon de Chars de Combat. For propaganda, each tank had been named after one of the ancient regions of France, numbers 90-99 being named Poitou; Provence; Picardie; Alsace; Bretagne; Touraine; Anjou; Normandie; Berry; Champagne respectively. In 1939, the Normandie was renamed Lorraine. As their main value was in propaganda, the giants were kept carefully out of harm's way and did not participate in the September 1939 attack on the Siegfried Line. They were used instead for numerous morale-boosting movies, in which they were often shown climbing and crushing old French forts. To the public, they obtained the reputation of invincible super tanks, the imagined dimensions of which far surpassed the actual particulars. French command was aware that this reputation was undeserved. When the German Panzerdivisionen, in the execution of Operation Fall Rot, breached the French lines after 10 June 1940, the decision was made to prevent the capture of the famous equipment. On 12 June 1940 the order was given to send the tanks south by rail transport. The broken down tanks N¬∞ 92 and 95 were destroyed, at Mairy-Mainville and Piennes respectively. The six remaining tanks hastily embarked on two trains at the station of Landres on 13 June. During the night they hid, still loaded, in the forest of Badonvillers. As no orders had been received regarding their destination, they remained at this spot during the 14th, being bombed in the early afternoon by the Italian Airforce but without incurring any damage. In the late afternoon, an order arrived to send the tanks to Neufch√¢teau which was reached in the early morning of 15 June. There it was decided to travel to Dijon.Mayet (1996), p. 40 However, fifteen kilometres south of Neufch√¢teau near the Meuse-sur-Meuse station,Steven J. Zaloga, 2011: French Tanks of World War I, p. 42 in a curve of the railway, the track was blocked by a blazing fuel train, while other trains jammed the exit to the rear. Due to the curve, it was impossible to unload the tanks. To prevent a capture of the mat√©riel by the enemy, it was ordered to destroy the vehicles. Charges were placed and the fuel pipes cut. The gasoline was lit and the tanks exploded around 19:00. The crews escaped to the south. The wrecks were subsequently discovered by the 8. Panzerdivision. Later Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Goering claimed that the tanks had been destroyed by German dive bombers. This German propaganda myth was accepted as an authentic event by contemporary writers and later repeated in many postwar sources. One tank, the Champagne, was nevertheless captured more or less intact and brought to Berlin to be exhibited as a war trophy until disappearing in 1948. After the war, rumours circulated that this vehicle had been transported to the Soviet Union.Mayet (1996), p. 24 Versions After a decision taken in December 1922, from 1923 until 1926 the later Champagne was modified at La Seyne into the Char 2C bis, an experimental type with a 155 mm howitzer in a rounded cast steel turret. The howitzer had a muzzle velocity of 200 m/s. New engines of the Soutter-Harl√© type were fitted and the three independent machine gun positions deleted. In this configuration the tank weighed perhaps 74 tons. The change was only temporary though, as the vehicle was brought back into its previous condition after 1934; the new turret was used in the Tunisian Mareth Line. Between 15 November and 15 December 1939 the Lorraine, as the company command tank, was experimentally up-armoured at the Soci√©t√© des Aci√©ries d'Homecourt to make it immune to standard German antitank guns. The front armour was enhanced to 90 mm, the side to 65 mm. In this configuration, weighing about 75 tons, the Lorraine had at that time the thickest armour of any operational tank, and is probably still the heaviest operational tank ever. Replacement In 1940 twelve FCM F1 tanks were ordered, another very large twin-turret tank. France was defeated before they entered service.

An account of his life and teachings are recorded in both the Words of Mormon and the Book of Mosiah. He was considered a king and a prophet, and was the spiritual and governmental leader of his people. He is believed to have been born roughly 190 BC. He is best associated with a speech to the people which begins in Mosiah Chapter 2. He talks about righteous living, and shares some of his philosophies of government, stating that the laws he and his father made are based on the commandments of God. He reminds the people that he has not oppressed them with taxes but worked with his own hands to support himself. He then prophesies of Jesus Christ‚ÄîHis birth which is more than 100 years away, His life, His ministry, His death and resurrection. Benjamin explains Jesus' atonement for the sins of mankind, and persuades the people to accept Jesus as their Savior. King Benjamin also proclaims that his son Mosiah will become the next king over the people. Benjamin, while still alive, gave the throne to him. Benjamin was a humble man who worked with his own hands to maintain himself and his family, refusing to live off his people or to surround himself with the trappings of wealth and power. Benjamin as record-keeper In the first edition of the Book of Mormon, in , Benjamin is said to have kept the Jaredite records. In later editions of the Book of Mormon, \\"Benjamin\\" was changed to \\"Mosiah,\\" since at the time the Nephites obtained the Jaredite records, Benjamin had handed over the throne to Mosiah his son. However, Hugh Nibley, a prominent 20th century LDS scholar, strongly objected to this change. \\"It was Benjamin who displayed the zeal of a life-long book-lover in the keeping and studying of records; and after he handed over the throne to his son Mosiah he lived on and may well have spent many days among his beloved records. And among these records could have been the Jaredite plates, which were brought to Zarahemla early in the reign of Mosiah, when his father could have still been living (). Analyses of King Benjamin's speech *In his book Since Cumorah, Hugh Nibley studies Benjamin's oration as an archetypal coronation speech. In Nibley's view, one of the main purposes of the kings' speech is on the peaceful continuation of the kingdom as the throne passes on to the rightful heir. *LDS scholars such as John W. Welch have analyzed King Benjamin's speech as a masterful example of chiasmus. Old Testament parallels According to Matthew B. Brown, parallels can be detected between the Jubilee year celebration in ancient Israel, the Feast of the Tabernacles, the coronation ceremony, and some of the material that is recorded in the book of Mosiah, especially concerning King Benjamin's sermon. Famous quotation King Benjamin said: \\"When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.\\" () In fiction The story \\"The Grave of a King\\", by Yusuf Haddad, is about the finding of the grave of King Benjamin by a group of archaeologists. Since the grave lacks any rich funeral offerings or any sign of opulence, the archaeologists conclude the grave is that of a simple ordinary peasant.

King Noah, described in the Book of Mosiah, is said to have presided over a wicked kingdom guided by false priests. Noah succeeds his father Zeniff, and is succeeded by his son Limhi.  Lineage Noah's father Zeniff Noah's father, Zeniff, led a group of Nephites into the land of their 'first inheritance' (the land originally settled by Lehi and his descendants upon their arrival in the Americas). Zeniff had made an agreement with the Lamanites in the area, but wars between the two peoples inevitably ensued. Upon his death Zeniff conferred the kingdom on Noah, who seems to have been far less diligent in preparing and protecting his people against their enemies than his father. Noah was an extremely wicked man and he taxed his people heavily, spending the money on extravagances and wickedness. Possibly the greatest wrong he did his subjects, however, was to teach them to follow his own wicked ways. He deposed the righteous priests who had been appointed by his father and replaced them with prideful ones. Through vanity and flattery they led the people to commit the same sins that they themselves did. Some of the sins that are listed are pride, laziness, idolatry, whoredoms, adultery, drunkenness, and riotous living. The prophet Abinadi The prophet Abinadi was sent to preach repentance to Noah's people, but was not immediately successful. He was imprisoned and taken before King Noah and his priests. They attempted to \\"cross him\\" (or prove him a liar) by asking difficult questions concerning the interpretation of scriptures, including an excerpt from Isaiah, but were unable to do so. Abinadi began to teach them the Ten Commandments and they attempted to \\"do away with him\\" but were unable to touch him because he was protected by the power of God. He continued to teach them the rest of the Ten Commandments, as well as to interpret further writings of Isaiah and teach them about Jesus Christ. He finished by testifying that redemption comes through Christ. Abinadi, having delivered his message, was executed by fire. As he was dying he prophesied that Noah and his priests would suffer death in a similar manner. The priest Alma One of the priests of Noah, a young man named Alma, believed Abinadi's words and pleaded with the king to spare the prophet's life. Alma was cast out, and was forced to hide so that the servants of the king would not kill him. He taught the words of Abinadi to more of the people, and many believed him. He also became a great prophet and religious leader among the rest of the Nephites later in his life. Hence, Abinadi was successful in his mission although he died a martyr and only one man believed his teachings. King Noah's wickedness and oppression of his people continued. Alma and his followers left Noah's people and the king's army were unable to follow them. A minority of Noah's people became angry with him, including a man named Gideon who swore to kill the king. They fought, and Noah saw that he was about to lose so he fled to a tower. From the top of the tower he saw an army of Lamanites about to attack and convinced Gideon to spare him so that he could lead the people to safety. Limhi becomes king Noah and his people fled, but were unable to escape the Lamanites. He ordered them to leave their wives and children behind. Some did, while others did not. They were captured by the Lamanites and returned to their lands, where they were taxed one half of all they owned and produced. They made Noah's son, Limhi, their king. Those who abandoned their families and stayed with Noah were sorry for their choice. They turned on Noah and his priests. They burned Noah to death but his priests ran away and hid in the wilderness. The men then returned, determined to find out what had happened to their families and to avenge them or die with them. They rejoined Limhi's people. Limhi ruled over his people in captivity for some time. Eventually they escaped and rejoined the main body of the Nephites in Zarahemla, as did Alma and his followers. Their story of the wickedness of King Noah and the consequences for his people was most likely a great motivation for the people in accepting King Mosiah's proposition that kingship be done away with among the Nephites. At the death of Mosiah, kings were replaced with a system of lesser and chief judges. The first chief judge was Alma (known as Alma the Younger), the son of that Alma who had been a priest of King Noah.

In a well planned and executed nighttime attack, a highly trained select group of George Washington's Continental Army troops under the command of Brigadier General \\"Mad Anthony\\" Wayne defeated British troops in a quick and daring assault on their outpost in Stony Point, New York, approximately north of New York City. The British suffered heavy losses in a battle that served as an important victory in terms of morale for the Continental Army. While the fort was ordered evacuated quickly after the battle by General Washington, this key crossing site was used later in the war by units of the Continental Army to cross the Hudson River on their way to victory over the British. Background Following the surrender of General John Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 and the subsequent entry of France into the war as an American ally, British strategy in dealing with the rebellious Americans was forced to change. In the northern states, their strategy was reduced to raids against targets of economic and military importance, and unsuccessful attempts to bring General George Washington's Continental Army into a decisive confrontation. Washington deployed his army in strong positions around the principal British base at New York City, and refused to be drawn out of them. British military plans for 1779 were large in ambition, but were ultimately hampered, in the opinion of their North American commander in chief, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, by shortages of manpower, and delays in the arrival of manpower that was promised for the campaign. Clinton sought to force Washington to weaken the Continental Army camp at Middlebrook in northern New Jersey, after which he would march in force out of New York and capture it.Johnston, pp. 27‚Äì32 This, Clinton believed, would threaten Washington's supply lines, drawing him out of the highlands on the Hudson River into more favorable terrain for a general engagement.Johnston, p. 44 =British dispositions= In late May 1779, General Clinton led a force of about 8,000 men up the North (or Hudson) River as the opening move in this strategy.Johnston, p. 45 The British strategists realized that the Stony Point location represented a vital area that controlled that portion of the Hudson River and the entrance to the Hudson Highlands, as well as the nearby Kings Ferry crossing. Because of this they decided to assault it. General Clinton, with approximately 6,000 British, Loyalist, and Hessian soldiers under his command sailed up the Hudson, transported by the Royal Navy and landed unopposed. Stony Point was defended by a meager force totaling around 40 American Patriots, and before escaping to the north the small garrison set fire to the wooden blockhouse that was the unfinished fort built atop Stony Point. The British forces, in order to capture nearby Fort Lafayette, hauled several cannons up the steep and rugged slopes of Stony Point and used the vantage point to shell Fort Lafayette. This move effectively closed King's Ferry, a major river crossing at that narrow point in the river, about south of West Point and north of New York City. While he waited for reinforcements to arrive so that he might march on Middlebrook, Clinton dispatched William Tryon and more than 2,000 troops on a raiding expedition in early July against coastal communities in Connecticut, claiming in retrospect that its purpose was to draw Washington's troops further east.Johnston, pp. 55‚Äì57 Clinton reduced the garrisons at Stony Point and Verplanck's Point for the operation, which failed to draw Washington out of his camps.Pancake, p. 17Nelson, p. 171 Stony Point was garrisoned with elements of the 17th Regiment of Foot under the command of Lt. Col. Henry Johnson. The 17th was reinforced by a grenadier company belonging to one of the two battalions of the 71st Regiment, and a company-strength detachment of the Loyal American Regiment. A detachment of the Royal Artillery manned fifteen field pieces that included five iron and two brass cannon, four mortars and four small howitzers. A Royal Navy gunboat was assigned to protect the river approaches to the fortifications, and the armed sloop Vulture was also anchored in that part of the river. Washington observed construction of the fortifications through a telescope from atop nearby Buckberg Mountain. Historians also believe he used intelligence gathered from local merchants to get a better idea of the strength of the garrison, the types of watchwords in use, and the placement of sentries ‚Äì especially on the south side of the point, which could not be seen from Buckberg. During this time he formulated a plan of attack and selected a commander to lead it ‚Äì Brigadier General Anthony Wayne, commander of the Pennsylvania Line. The British position at Stony Point was a fortified one, but it was never intended to be a true fort in the 18th century European sense of the word. No stone was used and no walls were constructed. The defenses consisted of earthen fleches (cannon positions) and wooden abatis (felled trees sharpened to a point and placed in earthen embankments). The defenses were situated on a rocky elevation approachable only from the west, protected in the front by a watery defile and on both flanks by extensive swampy areas. =American forces and tactics= A map showing the approach by Wayne's force to Stony Point. To storm the position, the Corps of Light Infantry was formed on June 12, with command assigned to General Wayne. The Corps of Light Infantry was an elite, seasonal combat organization drafted in each of the years between 1777 and 1781 from the light infantry companies of each regiment in Washington's army. The 1779 Corps was organized into a brigade of four regiments, each composed of two battalions of four companies, with the following order of battle:Hubbard, Robert Ernest. General Rufus Putnam: George Washington's Chief Military Engineer and the \\"Father of Ohio,\\" p. 74, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina. . *1st Regiment, commanded by Col. Christian Febiger of the 2nd Virginia Regiment: six companies of Virginia and two of Pennsylvania troops *2nd Regiment, Col. Richard Butler (9th Pennsylvania Regiment): four companies each of Pennsylvanians and of Marylanders;The Maryland companies included selected members of the Delaware Line. *3rd Regiment, Col. Return Jonathan Meigs (6th Connecticut Regiment): eight companies of Connecticut troops *4th Regiment, a partially organized detachment of six companies of Massachusetts troops and two of North Carolina, temporarily commanded by Major William Hull (8th Massachusetts Regiment). The 4th Regiment was fully organized in August and assigned to the command of Col. Rufus Putnam.Hubbard, Robert Ernest. General Rufus Putnam: George Washington's Chief Military Engineer and the \\"Father of Ohio,\\" p. 74, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina. . The plan called for a night attack on the fortifications to be carried out by the 1,350 men of the corps. Each regiment consisted of 300 to 340 men, and the total force included an artillery detachment to man captured British field pieces. According to 18th century military doctrine, this was not enough men to take a well-prepared defensive position, but in addition to the element of surprise, Washington's plan exploited a fatal flaw in the fortifications. The wooden abatis along the southern shore of the point were not extended into the deep water of the Hudson and could be outflanked by attackers along a narrow beach at low tide. The main attack would be along this approach, but Washington advised that if practicable, secondary and diversionary attacks could also be made along the north shore of the point and across the causeway to the center.Hubbard, Robert Ernest. General Rufus Putnam: George Washington's Chief Military Engineer and the \\"Father of Ohio,\\" p. 74-7, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina. . Washington gave Wayne his instructions, along with permission to modify the plan as necessary. This was an unusual act for Washington, and indicates the high opinion he had of Wayne's tactical abilities. The assault would be difficult: it would be carried out in the dead of night, called for the men to scale the steep, rocky sides of Stony Point, and required surprise. To accomplish this last element, Washington ordered that the men carry unloaded muskets and attack using only bayonets to maintain silence, a tactic often employed by the British army, and had been used to devastating effect against Wayne two years prior at Paoli.Hubbard, Robert Ernest. General Rufus Putnam: George Washington's Chief Military Engineer and the \\"Father of Ohio,\\" p. 75-7, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina. . The exception to loaded weaponry were the two companies of North Carolina light infantry, which Wayne ordered to cross the causeway, and stage a demonstration attack at the center of the British defenses, where the British expected an attack to come. This battalion, commanded by Maj. Hardy Murfree, was instructed to lay down a \\"gauling fire\\" with their weapons as a diversionary tactic. Wayne selected Butler's 2nd Regiment of approximately 300 men to conduct an assault along the northern shore of the point, while Wayne himself would lead the main column in the south, consisting of the 1st and 3rd Regiments, and Hull's detachment of Massachusetts light infantry. The columns deployed an advance force of 100 and 150 men respectively wielding axes to clear obstacles, with 20 men from each advance force assigned as the forlorn hopes, to protect the force and to be the first to enter the works. Wayne announced that he would give prize bounties to the first men who entered the works, and to anyone else who distinguished himself in the action. Battle A map showing the assault on Stony Point. After a morning muster, on July 15, the Corps of Light Infantry marched from Sandy Beach north of Fort Montgomery beginning at noon. Any civilians met along the route of march were to be taken into custody to prevent them from warning the British. The column, often forced to march single file over rough terrain and roads hardly more than paths, took a circuitous route west through Queensboro to the west and over Dunderberg Mountain to avoid detection by the British. The Corps began arriving at 8 p.m. at the Springsteel farm, a mile and a half (2 km) west of the fortifications, and by 10 p.m. had been formed in the attack columns. The men were given a rum ration and their orders. They were also given pieces of white paper to pin to their hats in order to help them tell each other from the British in the darkness. The columns then moved out at 11:30 p.m. to their jump-off points, diverging immediately, to begin the assault at midnight. These attack columns were led by groups of volunteer soldiers nicknamed the ‚Äúforlorn hope‚Äù who were responsible for breaking holes in enemy defenses and along with their weapons, were armed with axes and picks. Bad weather that night aided the Continentals. Cloud cover cut off moonlight and high winds forced the British ships in Haverstraw Bay to leave their posts off Stony Point and move downriver. At midnight, as scheduled, the attack began with the columns crossing the swampy flanks of the point. The southern column unexpectedly found its approach inundated in two to four feet of water and required thirty minutes to wade to the first line of abatis, during which it and Murfree's demonstration force were spotted by British sentries and fired upon. Under fire Wayne's column succeeded in getting inside the British first line of defenses. Wayne himself was struck in the head by a spent musket ball and fell to the ground, leaving Col. Febiger to take over command of Wayne's column. Meanwhile, Butler's column had succeeded in cutting its way through the abatis, sustaining the only loss of life on the American side while doing so. The two columns penetrated the British line almost simultaneously and seized the summit when six companies of the 17th Regiment of Foot took positions opposite the diversionary attack and were cut off. Because of the stealth in which the Patriot assault forces approached the British defenses on the slopes of the hill, the artillery pieces that the British had placed on the summit for just such defensive purposes were unsuccessful in repelling the attack. Due to the speed at which the Patriot infantrymen were moving, the British cannons could not be lowered to an angle low enough to sufficiently harass the men assaulting up the hill. The first man into the British upper works was Lt. Col. Francois de Fleury, an aristocrat French engineer commanding a battalion of the 1st Regiment. He was followed by Lt. Henry Knox, Sgt. William Baker, Sgt William Spencer and Sgt. George Donlop. As the men entered the British works they called out, \\"The fort's our own!\\" ‚Äì the prearranged watchword to distinguish friend from foe. The action lasted 25 minutes and was over by 1 a.m. Wayne's losses were 15 killed and 83 wounded. 546 prisoners were taken, 74 of whom were wounded.Boatner, p. 1066 Some Patriot sources stated that there were 63 British dead but military historian Mark M. Boatner accepts the official British report of 20 killed. However, the report (from Lt-Col. Johnson to Sir Henry Clinton on July 24) also lists 58 missing separate from killed, wounded, and captured, many of whom may have drowned in the Hudson.Johnston, pp. 127-129 Before dawn, Wayne sent a brief dispatch telling Washington, \\"The fort and garrison, with Colonel Johnston, are ours. Our officers and men behaved like men who are determined to be free.\\" The next day, Washington rode into the works to inspect the battlefield and congratulate the troops. For his exploits, Wayne was awarded a medal by Congress, one of the few issued during the revolution. Aftermath While the strategic value of capturing Stony Point was up for debate, it was regardless, a huge victory for morale for the Continental Army.Hubbard, Robert Ernest. General Rufus Putnam: George Washington's Chief Military Engineer and the \\"Father of Ohio,\\" p. 77, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina. . Its minimal strategic value was that it asserted Washington's foothold on the nearby West Point. Washington visited the battle site on the 17th of July, and applauded the men responsible for its capture after viewing the harsh terrain that was traversed by the assaulting forces. Washington's instructions to Wayne had allowed for the possibility of an assault on Verplanck's Point once Stony Point was taken.Johnston, p. 157 As part of the attack on Stony Point, Washington had directed two brigades to begin moving toward Verplanck's, and dispatched Colonel Rufus Putnam with a small force to divert the attention of its British garrison. Putnam was able to begin diversionary fire against Verplanck's shortly after the assault on Stony Point began, and he successfully distracted the British until morning.Johnston, p. 89 On the morning of the 16th Wayne's forces turned Stony Point's cannons against Verplanck's, but the fire at long range did no significant damage.Harper's, p. 240 The fire was sufficient, however, to prompt the Vulture to cut her anchor and drift downstream.Johnston, p. 87 Washington then sent General Robert Howe to lead the two brigades to besiege Verplanck's on the 17th, but the force was not provisioned with adequate artillery or siege equipment, and could do little more than blockade the fort. On the 18th some British troops were landed from ships sent upriver, and more were rumored to be coming overland, so Howe decided to withdraw.Rankin, p. 174Johnston, p. 90 Washington had not intended to hold either point, and Stony Point was abandoned by the Americans on July 18, after carrying off the captured cannons and supplies. The British briefly reoccupied the site only to abandon it in October, as General Clinton prepared a major expedition to the southern states. Some of the captured officers were exchanged immediately after the battle, but the more than 400 prisoners of other ranks were marched off to a prison camp at Easton, Pennsylvania. An unsuccessful attempt by a small number of prisoners on July 17 to overpower their captors resulted in one British sergeant killed and about 20 other ranks wounded. Contemporary Patriot accounts note that Wayne had given quarter to the garrison of Stony Point despite the alleged treatment of his own men at the \\"Paoli Massacre\\" in 1777. British reports also remarked that unanticipated clemency was immediately shown the garrison.Johnston, pp. 131,135,138 Because of the relative ease with which the Continental Army took over the fort however, the British commander of Stony Point, Colonel Johnson, was court martialed in New York City with accusations against him of inadequate defense. =Geography= The historic site at Stony Point. Situated about 30 miles north of New York City, the location of the fort at Stony Point was a vital place in terms of control of the lower Hudson River, as well as control over the major ferry crossing known as Kings Ferry, which crossed between Stony Point and Verplanck's Point. This ferry crossing was of key importance to both sides as it was a main point for the exchange of trade and supplies from New England to the rest of the colonies. Twelve miles north of Stony Point was West Point. This made the fort even more vital to the security of that region. West Point was a strategic fortification to General George Washington's Continental Army as the fortress and defenses there were vital in keeping control over the upper reaches of the Hudson River. A roughly triangular promontory jutting into the Hudson river just below Peekskill, New York, with steep rocky slopes rising up to a 150-foot summit, Stony Point boasts formidable natural defenses. This made assaulting the position such a daunting task and prompted the nickname ‚ÄòLittle Gibraltar. At the time of the battle, Stony Point was virtually an island, surrounded by water on all sides but the west, where a swampy area all but severed the Point from dry land. Today the swamp is now mostly dry, but otherwise the position is relatively unchanged, apart from a lighthouse and a museum with other State Park structures atop the hill. =Battlefield preservation= The Stony Point State Historic Site preserves the battlefield and has interpretive materials, tours, and demonstrations, primarily during the summer season. A museum on the site features artifacts from the battle, including a howitzer and two mortars. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Many of the original man made defenses built by the British still exist today. Markers and memorials commemorate certain sights and locations of key battles atop the fortress. The slopes leading up to the summit, which at the time of the battle were stripped of all foliage and vegetation for maximum defensive fields of fire, are now overgrown with vegetation. =In Media= A fictionalized version of the battle is featured in season three of the AMC television series Turn: Washington's Spies. The battle is incorrectly depicted as taking place during wintertime rather than summertime and the Americans are led by Major Benjamin Talmadge rather than General Anthony Wayne.

There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan. A CT scan can rule out bleeding, but may not necessarily rule out ischemia, which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing, and warfarin in people with atrial fibrillation. Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery. Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation, and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world. In 2013, approximately 6.9 million people had an ischemic stroke and 3.4 million people had a hemorrhagic stroke. In 2015, there were about 42.4 million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3 million deaths (11% of the total). About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke. About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year. Overall, two thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old. Classification There are two main categories of strokes. Ischemic (top), typically caused by a blood clot in an artery (1a) resulting in brain death to the affected area (2a). Hemorrhagic (bottom), caused by blood leaking into or around the brain from a ruptured blood vessel (1b) allowing blood to pool in the affected area (2b) thus increasing the pressure on the brain. middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke Strokes can be classified into two major categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes are caused by interruption of the blood supply to the brain, while hemorrhagic strokes result from the rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure. About 87% of strokes are ischemic, the rest being hemorrhagic. Bleeding can develop inside areas of ischemia, a condition known as \\"hemorrhagic transformation.\\" It is unknown how many hemorrhagic strokes actually start as ischemic strokes. =Definition= In the 1970s the World Health Organization defined stroke as a \\"neurological deficit of cerebrovascular cause that persists beyond 24 hours or is interrupted by death within 24 hours\\", although the word \\"stroke\\" is centuries old. This definition was supposed to reflect the reversibility of tissue damage and was devised for the purpose, with the time frame of 24 hours being chosen arbitrarily. The 24-hour limit divides stroke from transient ischemic attack, which is a related syndrome of stroke symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours. With the availability of treatments that can reduce stroke severity when given early, many now prefer alternative terminology, such as brain attack and acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (modeled after heart attack and acute coronary syndrome, respectively), to reflect the urgency of stroke symptoms and the need to act swiftly. =Ischemic= In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. There are four reasons why this might happen: # Thrombosis (obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot forming locally) # Embolism (obstruction due to an embolus from elsewhere in the body), # Systemic hypoperfusion (general decrease in blood supply, e.g., in shock) # Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A stroke without an obvious explanation is termed cryptogenic (of unknown origin); this constitutes 30‚Äì40% of all ischemic strokes. There are various classification systems for acute ischemic stroke. The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms; based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), lacunar infarct (LACI) or posterior circulation infarct (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain that is affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis. Later publications distinguish between \\"syndrome\\" and \\"infarct\\", based on evidence from imaging. \\"Syndrome\\" may be replaced by \\"hemorrhage\\" if imaging demonstrates a bleed. See The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, a stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery, (2) an embolism originating in the heart, (3) complete blockage of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation). Users of stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine are at a high risk for ischemic strokes. =Hemorrhagic= CT scan of an intraparenchymal bleed (bottom arrow) with surrounding edema (top arrow) There are two main types of hemorrhagic stroke: * Intracerebral hemorrhage, which is basically bleeding within the brain itself (when an artery in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood), due to either intraparenchymal hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain tissue) or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain's ventricular system). * Subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is basically bleeding that occurs outside of the brain tissue but still within the skull, and precisely between the arachnoid mater and pia mater (the delicate innermost layer of the three layers of the meninges that surround the brain). The above two main types of hemorrhagic stroke are also two different forms of intracranial hemorrhage, which is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the cranial vault; but the other forms of intracranial hemorrhage, such as epidural hematoma (bleeding between the skull and the dura mater, which is the thick outermost layer of the meninges that surround the brain) and subdural hematoma (bleeding in the subdural space), are not considered \\"hemorrhagic strokes\\". Hemorrhagic strokes may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition to neurological impairment, hemorrhagic strokes usually cause specific symptoms (for instance, subarachnoid hemorrhage classically causes a severe headache known as a thunderclap headache) or reveal evidence of a previous head injury. Signs and symptoms Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly, over seconds to minutes, and in most cases do not progress further. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. The more extensive the area of the brain affected, the more functions that are likely to be lost. Some forms of stroke can cause additional symptoms. For example, in intracranial hemorrhage, the affected area may compress other structures. Most forms of stroke are not associated with a headache, apart from subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage. =Early recognition= Various systems have been proposed to increase recognition of stroke. Different findings are able to predict the presence or absence of stroke to different degrees. Sudden-onset face weakness, arm drift (i.e., if a person, when asked to raise both arms, involuntarily lets one arm drift downward) and abnormal speech are the findings most likely to lead to the correct identification of a case of stroke, increasing the likelihood by 5.5 when at least one of these is present. Similarly, when all three of these are absent, the likelihood of stroke is decreased (‚Äì likelihood ratio of 0.39). While these findings are not perfect for diagnosing stroke, the fact that they can be evaluated relatively rapidly and easily make them very valuable in the acute setting. A mnemonic to remember the warning signs of stroke is FAST (facial droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and time to call emergency services), as advocated by the Department of Health (United Kingdom) and the Stroke Association, the American Stroke Association, the National Stroke Association (US), the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) and the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS). Use of these scales is recommended by professional guidelines. FAST is less reliable in the recognition of posterior circulation strokes. For people referred to the emergency room, early recognition of stroke is deemed important as this can expedite diagnostic tests and treatments. A scoring system called ROSIER (recognition of stroke in the emergency room) is recommended for this purpose; it is based on features from the medical history and physical examination. =Subtypes= If the area of the brain affected includes one of the three prominent central nervous system pathways‚Äîthe spinothalamic tract, corticospinal tract, and the dorsal column‚Äìmedial lemniscus pathway, symptoms may include: * hemiplegia and muscle weakness of the face * numbness * reduction in sensory or vibratory sensation * initial flaccidity (reduced muscle tone), replaced by spasticity (increased muscle tone), excessive reflexes, and obligatory synergies. In most cases, the symptoms affect only one side of the body (unilateral). Depending on the part of the brain affected, the defect in the brain is usually on the opposite side of the body. However, since these pathways also travel in the spinal cord and any lesion there can also produce these symptoms, the presence of any one of these symptoms does not necessarily indicate a stroke. In addition to the above CNS pathways, the brainstem gives rise to most of the twelve cranial nerves. A brainstem stroke affecting the brainstem and brain, therefore, can produce symptoms relating to deficits in these cranial nerves: * altered smell, taste, hearing, or vision (total or partial) * drooping of eyelid (ptosis) and weakness of ocular muscles * decreased reflexes: gag, swallow, pupil reactivity to light * decreased sensation and muscle weakness of the face * balance problems and nystagmus * altered breathing and heart rate * weakness in sternocleidomastoid muscle with inability to turn head to one side * weakness in tongue (inability to stick out the tongue or move it from side to side) If the cerebral cortex is involved, the CNS pathways can again be affected, but also can produce the following symptoms: * aphasia (difficulty with verbal expression, auditory comprehension, reading and writing; Broca's or Wernicke's area typically involved) * dysarthria (motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury) * apraxia (altered voluntary movements) * visual field defect * memory deficits (involvement of temporal lobe) * hemineglect (involvement of parietal lobe) * disorganized thinking, confusion, hypersexual gestures (with involvement of frontal lobe) * lack of insight of his or her, usually stroke-related, disability If the cerebellum is involved, ataxia might be present and this includes: * altered walking gait * altered movement coordination * vertigo and or disequilibrium =Associated symptoms= Loss of consciousness, headache, and vomiting usually occur more often in hemorrhagic stroke than in thrombosis because of the increased intracranial pressure from the leaking blood compressing the brain. If symptoms are maximal at onset, the cause is more likely to be a subarachnoid hemorrhage or an embolic stroke. Causes=Thrombotic stroke= Illustration of an embolic stroke, showing a blockage lodged in a blood vessel. In thrombotic stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower than that of a hemorrhagic stroke. A thrombus itself (even if it does not completely block the blood vessel) can lead to an embolic stroke (see below) if the thrombus breaks off and travels in the bloodstream, at which point it is called an embolus. Two types of thrombosis can cause stroke: * Large vessel disease involves the common and internal carotid arteries, the vertebral artery, and the Circle of Willis. Diseases that may form thrombi in the large vessels include (in descending incidence): atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction (tightening of the artery), aortic, carotid or vertebral artery dissection, various inflammatory diseases of the blood vessel wall (Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, vasculitis), noninflammatory vasculopathy, Moyamoya disease and fibromuscular dysplasia. * Small vessel disease involves the smaller arteries inside the brain: branches of the circle of Willis, middle cerebral artery, stem, and arteries arising from the distal vertebral and basilar artery. Diseases that may form thrombi in the small vessels include (in descending incidence): lipohyalinosis (build-up of fatty hyaline matter in the blood vessel as a result of high blood pressure and aging) and fibrinoid degeneration (a stroke involving these vessels is known as a lacunar stroke) and microatheroma (small atherosclerotic plaques). Sickle-cell anemia, which can cause blood cells to clump up and block blood vessels, can also lead to stroke. A stroke is the second leading cause of death in people under 20 with sickle-cell anemia. Air pollution may also increase stroke risk. =Embolic stroke= An embolic stroke refers to an arterial embolism (a blockage of an artery) by an embolus, a traveling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating from elsewhere. An embolus is most frequently a thrombus, but it can also be a number of other substances including fat (e.g., from bone marrow in a broken bone), air, cancer cells or clumps of bacteria (usually from infectious endocarditis). Because an embolus arises from elsewhere, local therapy solves the problem only temporarily. Thus, the source of the embolus must be identified. Because the embolic blockage is sudden in onset, symptoms usually are maximal at the start. Also, symptoms may be transient as the embolus is partially resorbed and moves to a different location or dissipates altogether. Emboli most commonly arise from the heart (especially in atrial fibrillation) but may originate from elsewhere in the arterial tree. In paradoxical embolism, a deep vein thrombosis embolizes through an atrial or ventricular septal defect in the heart into the brain. Causes of stroke related to the heart can be distinguished between high and low-risk: * High risk: atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, rheumatic disease of the mitral or aortic valve disease, artificial heart valves, known cardiac thrombus of the atrium or ventricle, sick sinus syndrome, sustained atrial flutter, recent myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial infarction together with ejection fraction <28 percent, symptomatic congestive heart failure with ejection fraction <30 percent, dilated cardiomyopathy, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, Marantic endocarditis, infective endocarditis, papillary fibroelastoma, left atrial myxoma and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. * Low risk/potential: calcification of the annulus (ring) of the mitral valve, patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal aneurysm, atrial septal aneurysm with patent foramen ovale, left ventricular aneurysm without thrombus, isolated left atrial \\"smoke\\" on echocardiography (no mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation), complex atheroma in the ascending aorta or proximal arch. Among those who have a complete blockage of one of the carotid arteries, the risk of stroke on that side is about one percent per year. A special form of embolic stroke is the embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). This subset of cryptogenic stroke is defined as a non-lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources. About one out of six ischemic strokes could be classified as ESUS. =Cerebral hypoperfusion= Cerebral hypoperfusion is the reduction of blood flow to all parts of the brain. The reduction could be to a particular part of the brain depending on the cause. It is most commonly due to heart failure from cardiac arrest or arrhythmias, or from reduced cardiac output as a result of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, or bleeding. Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen content) may precipitate the hypoperfusion. Because the reduction in blood flow is global, all parts of the brain may be affected, especially vulnerable \\"watershed\\" areas‚Äîborder zone regions supplied by the major cerebral arteries. A watershed stroke refers to the condition when the blood supply to these areas is compromised. Blood flow to these areas does not necessarily stop, but instead it may lessen to the point where brain damage can occur. =Venous thrombosis= Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis leads to stroke due to locally increased venous pressure, which exceeds the pressure generated by the arteries. Infarcts are more likely to undergo hemorrhagic transformation (leaking of blood into the damaged area) than other types of ischemic stroke. =Intracerebral hemorrhage= It generally occurs in small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to hypertension, intracranial vascular malformations (including cavernous angiomas or arteriovenous malformations), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or infarcts into which secondary hemorrhage has occurred. Other potential causes are trauma, bleeding disorders, amyloid angiopathy, illicit drug use (e.g., amphetamines or cocaine). The hematoma enlarges until pressure from surrounding tissue limits its growth, or until it decompresses by emptying into the ventricular system, CSF or the pial surface. A third of intracerebral bleed is into the brain's ventricles. ICH has a mortality rate of 44 percent after 30 days, higher than ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage (which technically may also be classified as a type of stroke). =Other= Other causes may include spasm of an artery. This may occur due to cocaine. =Silent stroke= A silent stroke is a stroke that does not have any outward symptoms, and people are typically unaware they have had a stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms, a silent stroke still damages the brain and places the person at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. Conversely, those who have had a major stroke are also at risk of having silent strokes. In a broad study in 1998, more than 11 million people were estimated to have experienced a stroke in the United States. Approximately 770,000 of these strokes were symptomatic and 11 million were first-ever silent MRI infarcts or hemorrhages. Silent strokes typically cause lesions which are detected via the use of neuroimaging such as MRI. Silent strokes are estimated to occur at five times the rate of symptomatic strokes. The risk of silent stroke increases with age, but may also affect younger adults and children, especially those with acute anemia. Pathophysiology=Ischemic= Ischemic stroke occurs because of a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, initiating the ischemic cascade. Brain tissue ceases to function if deprived of oxygen for more than 60 to 90 seconds, and after approximately three hours will suffer irreversible injury possibly leading to the death of the tissue, i.e., infarction. (This is why fibrinolytics such as alteplase are given only until three hours since the onset of the stroke.) Atherosclerosis may disrupt the blood supply by narrowing the lumen of blood vessels leading to a reduction of blood flow, by causing the formation of blood clots within the vessel, or by releasing showers of small emboli through the disintegration of atherosclerotic plaques. Embolic infarction occurs when emboli formed elsewhere in the circulatory system, typically in the heart as a consequence of atrial fibrillation, or in the carotid arteries, break off, enter the cerebral circulation, then lodge in and block brain blood vessels. Since blood vessels in the brain are now blocked, the brain becomes low in energy, and thus it resorts to using anaerobic metabolism within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia. Anaerobic metabolism produces less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but releases a by-product called lactic acid. Lactic acid is an irritant which could potentially destroy cells since it is an acid and disrupts the normal acid-base balance in the brain. The ischemia area is referred to as the \\"ischemic penumbra\\".Brunner and Suddarth's Textbook on Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Edition As oxygen or glucose becomes depleted in ischemic brain tissue, the production of high energy phosphate compounds such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fails, leading to failure of energy- dependent processes (such as ion pumping) necessary for tissue cell survival. This sets off a series of interrelated events that result in cellular injury and death. A major cause of neuronal injury is the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The concentration of glutamate outside the cells of the nervous system is normally kept low by so-called uptake carriers, which are powered by the concentration gradients of ions (mainly Na+) across the cell membrane. However, stroke cuts off the supply of oxygen and glucose which powers the ion pumps maintaining these gradients. As a result, the transmembrane ion gradients run down, and glutamate transporters reverse their direction, releasing glutamate into the extracellular space. Glutamate acts on receptors in nerve cells (especially NMDA receptors), producing an influx of calcium which activates enzymes that digest the cells' proteins, lipids, and nuclear material. Calcium influx can also lead to the failure of mitochondria, which can lead further toward energy depletion and may trigger cell death due to programmed cell death. Ischemia also induces production of oxygen free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. These react with and damage a number of cellular and extracellular elements. Damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium is particularly important. In fact, many antioxidant neuroprotectants such as uric acid and NXY-059 work at the level of the endothelium and not in the brain per se. Free radicals also directly initiate elements of the programmed cell death cascade by means of redox signaling. These processes are the same for any type of ischemic tissue and are referred to collectively as the ischemic cascade. However, brain tissue is especially vulnerable to ischemia since it has little respiratory reserve and is completely dependent on aerobic metabolism, unlike most other organs. In addition to damaging effects on brain cells, ischemia and infarction can result in loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels, partly through the release of matrix metalloproteases, which are zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that break down collagen, hyaluronic acid, and other elements of connective tissue. Other proteases also contribute to this process. The loss of vascular structural integrity results in a breakdown of the protective blood brain barrier that contributes to cerebral edema, which can cause secondary progression of the brain injury. =Hemorrhagic= Hemorrhagic strokes are classified based on their underlying pathology. Some causes of hemorrhagic stroke are hypertensive hemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm, ruptured AV fistula, transformation of prior ischemic infarction, and drug- induced bleeding. They result in tissue injury by causing compression of tissue from an expanding hematoma or hematomas. In addition, the pressure may lead to a loss of blood supply to affected tissue with resulting infarction, and the blood released by brain hemorrhage appears to have direct toxic effects on brain tissue and vasculature. Inflammation contributes to the secondary brain injury after hemorrhage. Diagnosis A CT showing early signs of a middle cerebral artery stroke with loss of definition of the gyri and grey white boundary Dens media sign in a patient with middle cerebral artery infarction shown on the left. Right image after 7 hours. Stroke is diagnosed through several techniques: a neurological examination (such as the NIHSS), CT scans (most often without contrast enhancements) or MRI scans, Doppler ultrasound, and arteriography. The diagnosis of stroke itself is clinical, with assistance from the imaging techniques. Imaging techniques also assist in determining the subtypes and cause of stroke. There is yet no commonly used blood test for the stroke diagnosis itself, though blood tests may be of help in finding out the likely cause of stroke. =Physical examination= A physical examination, including taking a medical history of the symptoms and a neurological status, helps giving an evaluation of the location and severity of a stroke. It can give a standard score on e.g., the NIH stroke scale. =Imaging= For diagnosing ischemic (blockage) stroke in the emergency setting: * CT scans (without contrast enhancements) : sensitivity= 16% (less than 10% within first 3 hours of symptom onset) : specificity= 96% * MRI scan : sensitivity= 83% : specificity= 98% For diagnosing hemorrhagic stroke in the emergency setting: * CT scans (without contrast enhancements) : sensitivity= 89% : specificity= 100% * MRI scan : sensitivity= 81% : specificity= 100% For detecting chronic hemorrhages, MRI scan is more sensitive. For the assessment of stable stroke, nuclear medicine scans SPECT and PET/CT may be helpful. SPECT documents cerebral blood flow and PET with FDG isotope the metabolic activity of the neurons. CT scans may not detect an ischemic stroke, especially if it is small, of recent onset, or in the brainstem or cerebellum areas. A CT scan is more to rule out certain stroke mimics and detect bleeding. =Underlying cause= T-waves. Various ECG changes may occur in people with strokes and other brain disorders. When a stroke has been diagnosed, various other studies may be performed to determine the underlying cause. With the current treatment and diagnosis options available, it is of particular importance to determine whether there is a peripheral source of emboli. Test selection may vary since the cause of stroke varies with age, comorbidity and the clinical presentation. The following are commonly used techniques: * an ultrasound/doppler study of the carotid arteries (to detect carotid stenosis) or dissection of the precerebral arteries; * an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (to identify arrhythmias and resultant clots in the heart which may spread to the brain vessels through the bloodstream); * a Holter monitor study to identify intermittent abnormal heart rhythms; * an angiogram of the cerebral vasculature (if a bleed is thought to have originated from an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation); * blood tests to determine if blood cholesterol is high, if there is an abnormal tendency to bleed, and if some rarer processes such as homocystinuria might be involved. For hemorrhagic strokes, a CT or MRI scan with intravascular contrast may be able to identify abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive cerebral angiography could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an intravascular catheter and can cause further strokes as well as complications at the insertion site and this investigation is therefore reserved for specific situations. If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred as a result of venous thrombosis, CT or MRI venography can be used to examine the cerebral veins. =Misdiagnosis= Among people with ischemic strokes, misdiagnosis occurs 2 to 26% of the time. A \\"stroke chameleon\\" (SC) is stroke which is diagnosed as something else. People not having a stroke may also be misdiagnosed as a stroke. Giving thrombolytics (clot-busting) in such cases causes intracerebral bleeding 1 to 2% of the time, which is less than that of people with strokes. This unnecessary treatment adds to health care costs. Even so, the AHA/ASA guidelines state that starting intravenous tPA in possible mimics is preferred to delaying treatment for additional testing. Women, African-Americans, Hispanic- Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders are more often misdiagnosed for a condition other than stroke when in fact having a stroke. In addition, adults under 44 years-of-age are seven times more likely to have a stroke missed than are adults over 75 years-of-age. This is especially the case for younger people with posterior circulation infarcts. Some medical centers have used hyperacute MRI in experimental studies for persons initially thought to have a low likelihood of stroke. And in some of these persons, strokes have been found which were then treated with thrombolytic medication. Prevention Given the disease burden of strokes, prevention is an important public health concern. Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year). Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke. In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended. In people who have had a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a first stroke.NPS Prescribing Practice Review 44: Antiplatelets and anticoagulants in stroke prevention (2009). Available at nps.org.au In those who have previously had a stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms. =Risk factors= The most important modifiable risk factors for stroke are high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation although the size of the effect is small with 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke. Other modifiable risk factors include high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, end-stage kidney disease, cigarette smoking (active and passive), heavy alcohol use, drug use, lack of physical activity, obesity, processed red meat consumption, and unhealthy diet. Smoking just one cigarette per day increases the risk more than 30%. Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, as well as intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example, via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound thrombocytosis and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances). Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension. Migraine with aura doubles a person's risk for ischemic stroke. Untreated, celiac disease regardless of the presence of symptoms can be an underlying cause of stroke, both in children and adults. High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of stroke by about 26%. There is a lack of high quality studies looking at promotional efforts to improve lifestyle factors. Nonetheless, given the large body of circumstantial evidence, best medical management for stroke includes advice on diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol use. Medication is the most common method of stroke prevention; carotid endarterectomy can be a useful surgical method of preventing stroke. Blood pressure High blood pressure accounts for 35‚Äì50% of stroke risk. Blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg systolic or 5 mmHg diastolic reduces the risk of stroke by ~40%. Lowering blood pressure has been conclusively shown to prevent both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It is equally important in secondary prevention. Even people older than 80 years and those with isolated systolic hypertension benefit from antihypertensive therapy. The available evidence does not show large differences in stroke prevention between antihypertensive drugs‚Äîtherefore, other factors such as protection against other forms of cardiovascular disease and cost should be considered. The routine use of beta-blockers following a stroke or TIA has not been shown to result in benefits. Blood lipids High cholesterol levels have been inconsistently associated with (ischemic) stroke. Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by about 15%. Since earlier meta-analyses of other lipid-lowering drugs did not show a decreased risk, statins might exert their effect through mechanisms other than their lipid-lowering effects. Diabetes mellitus Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of stroke by 2 to 3 times. While intensive blood sugar control has been shown to reduce small blood vessel complications such as kidney damage and damage to the retina of the eye it has not been shown to reduce large blood vessel complications such as stroke. Anticoagulation drugs Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin have been the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several studies have shown that aspirin and other antiplatelets are highly effective in secondary prevention after a stroke or transient ischemic attack. Low doses of aspirin (for example 75‚Äì150 mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown. Thienopyridines (clopidogrel, ticlopidine) might be slightly more effective than aspirin and have a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but are more expensive. Both aspirin and clopidogrel may be useful in the first few weeks after a minor stroke or high risk TIA. Clopidogrel has less side effects than ticlopidine. Dipyridamole can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect. Low- dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after having a myocardial infarction. Those with atrial fibrillation have a 5% a year risk of stroke, and this risk is higher in those with valvular atrial fibrillation. Depending on the stroke risk, anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin or aspirin is useful for prevention. Except in people with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulants are not advised for stroke prevention‚Äîany benefit is offset by bleeding risk. In primary prevention, however, antiplatelet drugs did not reduce the risk of ischemic stroke but increased the risk of major bleeding. Further studies are needed to investigate a possible protective effect of aspirin against ischemic stroke in women. Surgery Carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty can be used to remove atherosclerotic narrowing of the carotid artery. There is evidence supporting this procedure in selected cases. Endarterectomy for a significant stenosis has been shown to be useful in preventing further strokes in those who have already had one. Carotid artery stenting has not been shown to be equally useful. People are selected for surgery based on age, gender, degree of stenosis, time since symptoms and the person's preferences. Surgery is most efficient when not delayed too long‚Äîthe risk of recurrent stroke in a person who has a 50% or greater stenosis is up to 20% after 5 years, but endarterectomy reduces this risk to around 5%. The number of procedures needed to cure one person was 5 for early surgery (within two weeks after the initial stroke), but 125 if delayed longer than 12 weeks. Screening for carotid artery narrowing has not been shown to be a useful test in the general population. Studies of surgical intervention for carotid artery stenosis without symptoms have shown only a small decrease in the risk of stroke. To be beneficial, the complication rate of the surgery should be kept below 4%. Even then, for 100 surgeries, 5 people will benefit by avoiding stroke, 3 will develop stroke despite surgery, 3 will develop stroke or die due to the surgery itself, and 89 will remain stroke- free but would also have done so without intervention. Diet Nutrition, specifically the Mediterranean-style diet, has the potential for decreasing the risk of having a stroke by more than half. It does not appear that lowering levels of homocysteine with folic acid affects the risk of stroke. =Women= A number of specific recommendations have been made for women including taking aspirin after the 11th week of pregnancy if there is a history of previous chronic high blood pressure and taking blood pressure medications during pregnancy if the blood pressure is greater than 150 mmHg systolic or greater than 100 mmHg diastolic. In those who have previously had preeclampsia other risk factors should be treated more aggressively. =Previous stroke or TIA= Keeping blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg is recommended. Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent ischemic strokes. Among people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anticoagulation started early after an embolic stroke.ACP JC synopsis Stroke prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation is determined according to the CHA2DS2‚ÄìVASc score. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the oral agent warfarin while a number of newer agents including dabigatran are alternatives which do not require prothrombin time monitoring. Anticoagulants, when used following stroke, should not be stopped for dental procedures. If studies show carotid artery stenosis, and the person has a degree of residual function on the affected side, carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of the stenosis) may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after stroke. Management=Ischemic stroke= Aspirin reduces the overall risk of recurrence by 13% with greater benefit early on. Definitive therapy within the first few hours is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down (thrombolysis), or by removing it mechanically (thrombectomy). The philosophical premise underlying the importance of rapid stroke intervention was summed up as Time is Brain! in the early 1990s. Years later, that same idea, that rapid cerebral blood flow restoration results in fewer brain cells dying, has been proved and quantified. Tight blood sugar control in the first few hours does not improve outcomes and may cause harm. High blood pressure is also not typically lowered as this has not been found to be helpful. Cerebrolysin, a mix of pig brain tissue used to treat acute ischemic stroke in many Asian and European countries, does not improve outcomes and may increase the risk of severe adverse events. Thrombolysis Thrombolysis, such as with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), in acute ischemic stroke, when given within three hours of symptom onset, results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to living without disability. It does not, however, improve chances of survival. Benefit is greater the earlier it is used. Between three and four and a half hours the effects are less clear. The AHA/ASA recommend it for certain people in this time frame. A 2014 review found a 5% increase in the number of people living without disability at three to six months; however, there was a 2% increased risk of death in the short term. After four and a half hours thrombolysis worsens outcomes. These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated. There is no reliable way to determine who will have an intracranial bleed post-treatment versus who will not. In those with findings of savable tissue on medical imaging between 4.5 hours and 9 hours or who wake up with a stroke, alteplase results in some benefit. Its use is endorsed by the American Heart Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms as long as there are no other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome. When administered within the first three hours thrombolysis improves functional outcome without affecting mortality. 6.4% of people with large strokes developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus part of the reason for increased short term mortality. The American Academy of Emergency Medicine had previously stated that objective evidence regarding the applicability of tPA for acute ischemic stroke was insufficient. In 2013 the American College of Emergency Medicine refuted this position, acknowledging the body of evidence for the use of tPA in ischemic stroke; but debate continues. Intra- arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke. Endovascular treatment Mechanical removal of the blood clot causing the ischemic stroke, called mechanical thrombectomy, is a potential treatment for occlusion of a large artery, such as the middle cerebral artery. In 2015, one review demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this procedure if performed within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms. It did not change the risk of death, but reduced disability compared to the use of intravenous thrombolysis which is generally used in people evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy. Certain cases may benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.  Craniectomy  Strokes affecting large portions of the brain can cause significant brain swelling with secondary brain injury in surrounding tissue. This phenomenon is mainly encountered in strokes affecting brain tissue dependent upon the middle cerebral artery for blood supply and is also called \\"malignant cerebral infarction\\" because it carries a dismal prognosis. Relief of the pressure may be attempted with medication, but some require hemicraniectomy, the temporary surgical removal of the skull on one side of the head. This decreases the risk of death, although some people - who would otherwise have died - survive with disability. =Hemorrhagic stroke= People with intracerebral hemorrhage require supportive care, including blood pressure control if required. People are monitored for changes in the level of consciousness, and their blood sugar and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels. Anticoagulants and antithrombotics can make bleeding worse and are generally discontinued (and reversed if possible). A proportion may benefit from neurosurgical intervention to remove the blood and treat the underlying cause, but this depends on the location and the size of the hemorrhage as well as patient-related factors, and ongoing research is being conducted into the question as to which people with intracerebral hemorrhage may benefit. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, early treatment for underlying cerebral aneurysms may reduce the risk of further hemorrhages. Depending on the site of the aneurysm this may be by surgery that involves opening the skull or endovascularly (through the blood vessels). =Stroke unit= Ideally, people who have had a stroke are admitted to a \\"stroke unit\\", a ward or dedicated area in a hospital staffed by nurses and therapists with experience in stroke treatment. It has been shown that people admitted to a stroke unit have a higher chance of surviving than those admitted elsewhere in hospital, even if they are being cared for by doctors without experience in stroke. Nursing care is fundamental in maintaining skin care, feeding, hydration, positioning, and monitoring vital signs such as temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. =Rehabilitation= Stroke rehabilitation is the process by which those with disabling strokes undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living. It also aims to help the survivor understand and adapt to difficulties, prevent secondary complications, and educate family members to play a supporting role. Stroke rehabilitation should begin almost immediately with a multidisciplinary approach. The rehabilitation team may involve physicians trained in rehabilitation medicine, neurologists, clinical pharmacists, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and orthotists. Some teams may also include psychologists and social workers, since at least one-third of affected people manifests post stroke depression. Validated instruments such as the Barthel scale may be used to assess the likelihood of a person who has had a stroke being able to manage at home with or without support subsequent to discharge from a hospital. Stroke rehabilitation should be started as quickly as possible and can last anywhere from a few days to over a year. Most return of function is seen in the first few months, and then improvement falls off with the \\"window\\" considered officially by U.S. state rehabilitation units and others to be closed after six months, with little chance of further improvement. However, some people have reported that they continue to improve for years, regaining and strengthening abilities like writing, walking, running, and talking. Daily rehabilitation exercises should continue to be part of the daily routine for people who have had a stroke. Complete recovery is unusual but not impossible and most people will improve to some extent: proper diet and exercise are known to help the brain to recover.  Physical and occupational therapy  Physical and occupational therapy have overlapping areas of expertise; however, physical therapy focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with people who have had a stroke to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and people's goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint- induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the person relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes. Physical therapy is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Occupational therapy is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. Approaches to helping people with urinary incontinence include physical therapy, cognitive therapy, and specialized interventions with experienced medical professionals, however, it is not clear how effective these approaches are at improving urinary incontinence following a stroke. Treatment of spasticity related to stroke often involves early mobilizations, commonly performed by a physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through various different positions. Gaining initial improvement in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb. After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb with the use of splints or other tools to stabilize the joint. Cold in the form of ice wraps or ice packs have been proven to briefly reduce spasticity by temporarily dampening neural firing rates. Electrical stimulation to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success. Physical therapy is sometimes suggested for people who experience sexual dysfunction following a stroke.  Speech and language therapy  Speech and language therapy is appropriate for people with the speech production disorders: dysarthria and apraxia of speech, aphasia, cognitive-communication impairments, and problems with swallowing. Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke compared to no therapy improves functional communication, reading, writing and expressive language. There may be benefit in high intensity and high doses over a longer period, but these higher intensity doses may not be acceptable to everyone. People who have had a stroke may have particular problems, such as dysphagia, which can cause swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a nasogastric tube may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely. Swallowing therapy has mixed results as of 2018.  Devices  Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved by the use of ankle foot orthoses.  Physical fitness  A stroke can also reduce people's general fitness. Reduced fitness can reduce capacity for rehabilitation as well as general health. Physical exercises as part of a rehabilitation program following a stroke appear safe. Cardiorespiratory fitness training that involves walking in rehabilitation can improve speed, tolerance and independence during walking, and may improve balance. There are inadequate long-term data about the effects of exercise and training on death, dependence and disability after a stroke. The future areas of research may concentrate on the optimal exercise prescription and long-term health benefits of exercise. The effect of physical training on cognition also may be studied further. The ability to walk independently in their community, indoors or outdoors, is important following stroke. Although no negative effects have been reported, it is unclear if outcomes can improve with these walking programs when compared to usual treatment.  Other therapy methods  Some current and future therapy methods include the use of virtual reality and video games for rehabilitation. These forms of rehabilitation offer potential for motivating people to perform specific therapy tasks that many other forms do not. While virtual reality and interactive video gaming are not more effective than conventional therapy for improving upper limb function, when used in conjunction with usual care these approaches may improve upper limb function and ADL function. There are inadequate data on the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on gait speed, balance, participation and quality of life. Many clinics and hospitals are adopting the use of these off-the- shelf devices for exercise, social interaction, and rehabilitation because they are affordable, accessible and can be used within the clinic and home. Mirror therapy is associated with improved motor function of the upper extremity in people who have had a stroke. Other non-invasive rehabilitation methods used to augment physical therapy of motor function in people recovering from a stroke include transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct-current stimulation. and robotic therapies. Constraint‚Äêinduced movement therapy (CIMT), mental practice, mirror therapy, interventions for sensory impairment, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice may be effective in improving upper limb function. However, further primary research, specifically of CIMT, mental practice, mirror therapy and virtual reality is needed. = Self-management = A stroke can affect the ability to live independently and with quality. Self-management programs are a special training that educates stroke survivors about stroke and its consequences, helps them acquire skills to cope with their challenges, and helps them set and meet their own goals during their recovery process. These programs are tailored to the target audience, and led by someone trained and expert in stroke and its consequences (most commonly professionals, but also stroke survivors and peers). A 2016 review reported that these programs improve the quality of life after stroke, without negative effects. People with stroke felt more empowered, happy and satisfied with life after participating in this training. Prognosis Disability affects 75% of stroke survivors enough to decrease their ability to work. Stroke can affect people physically, mentally, emotionally, or a combination of the three. The results of stroke vary widely depending on size and location of the lesion. = Physical effects = Some of the physical disabilities that can result from stroke include muscle weakness, numbness, pressure sores, pneumonia, incontinence, apraxia (inability to perform learned movements), difficulties carrying out daily activities, appetite loss, speech loss, vision loss and pain. If the stroke is severe enough, or in a certain location such as parts of the brainstem, coma or death can result. Up to 10% of people following a stroke develop seizures, most commonly in the week subsequent to the event; the severity of the stroke increases the likelihood of a seizure. An estimated 15% of people experience urinary incontinence for more than a year following a stroke. 50% of people have a decline in sexual function (sexual dysfunction) following a stroke. = Emotional and mental effects = Emotional and mental dysfunctions correspond to areas in the brain that have been damaged. Emotional problems following a stroke can be due to direct damage to emotional centers in the brain or from frustration and difficulty adapting to new limitations. Post-stroke emotional difficulties include anxiety, panic attacks, flat affect (failure to express emotions), mania, apathy and psychosis. Other difficulties may include a decreased ability to communicate emotions through facial expression, body language and voice. Disruption in self-identity, relationships with others, and emotional well-being can lead to social consequences after stroke due to the lack of ability to communicate. Many people who experience communication impairments after a stroke find it more difficult to cope with the social issues rather than physical impairments. Broader aspects of care must address the emotional impact speech impairment has on those who experience difficulties with speech after a stroke. Those who experience a stroke are at risk of paralysis which could result in a self disturbed body image which may also lead to other social issues. 30 to 50% of stroke survivors suffer post-stroke depression, which is characterized by lethargy, irritability, sleep disturbances, lowered self- esteem and withdrawal. Depression can reduce motivation and worsen outcome, but can be treated with social and family support, psychotherapy and, in severe cases, antidepressants. Psychotherapy sessions may have a small effect on improving mood and preventing depression after a stroke, however psychotherapy does not appear to be effective at treating depression after a stroke. Antidepressant medications may be useful for treating depression after a stroke. Emotional lability, another consequence of stroke, causes the person to switch quickly between emotional highs and lows and to express emotions inappropriately, for instance with an excess of laughing or crying with little or no provocation. While these expressions of emotion usually correspond to the person's actual emotions, a more severe form of emotional lability causes the affected person to laugh and cry pathologically, without regard to context or emotion. Some people show the opposite of what they feel, for example crying when they are happy. Emotional lability occurs in about 20% of those who have had a stroke. Those with a right hemisphere stroke are more likely to have an empathy problems which can make communication harder. Cognitive deficits resulting from stroke include perceptual disorders, aphasia, dementia, and problems with attention and memory. A stroke sufferer may be unaware of his or her own disabilities, a condition called anosognosia. In a condition called hemispatial neglect, the affected person is unable to attend to anything on the side of space opposite to the damaged hemisphere.Cognitive and psychological outcome after a stroke can be affected by the age at which the stroke happened, pre-stroke baseline intellectual functioning, psychiatric history and whether there is pre-existing brain pathology. Epidemiology thumbStroke deaths per million persons in 2012 Disability-adjusted life year for cerebral vascular disease per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Stroke was the second most frequent cause of death worldwide in 2011, accounting for 6.2 million deaths (~11% of the total). Approximately 17 million people had a stroke in 2010 and 33 million people have previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. Overall, two-thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old. South Asians are at particularly high risk of stroke, accounting for 40% of global stroke deaths. It is ranked after heart disease and before cancer. In the United States stroke is a leading cause of disability, and recently declined from the third leading to the fourth leading cause of death. Geographic disparities in stroke incidence have been observed, including the existence of a \\"stroke belt\\" in the southeastern United States, but causes of these disparities have not been explained. The risk of stroke increases exponentially from 30 years of age, and the cause varies by age. Advanced age is one of the most significant stroke risk factors. 95% of strokes occur in people age 45 and older, and two-thirds of strokes occur in those over the age of 65. A person's risk of dying if he or she does have a stroke also increases with age. However, stroke can occur at any age, including in childhood. Family members may have a genetic tendency for stroke or share a lifestyle that contributes to stroke. Higher levels of Von Willebrand factor are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke for the first time. The results of this study found that the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood type. Having had a stroke in the past greatly increases one's risk of future strokes. Men are 25% more likely to suffer strokes than women, yet 60% of deaths from stroke occur in women. Since women live longer, they are older on average when they have their strokes and thus more often killed. Some risk factors for stroke apply only to women. Primary among these are pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and the treatment thereof (HRT). History Hippocrates first described the sudden paralysis that is often associated with stroke. Episodes of stroke and familial stroke have been reported from the 2nd millennium BC onward in ancient Mesopotamia and Persia. Hippocrates (460 to 370 BC) was first to describe the phenomenon of sudden paralysis that is often associated with ischemia. Apoplexy, from the Greek word meaning \\"struck down with violence\\", first appeared in Hippocratic writings to describe this phenomenon. The word stroke was used as a synonym for apoplectic seizure as early as 1599,R. Barnhart, ed. The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology (1995) and is a fairly literal translation of the Greek term. In 1658, in his Apoplexia, Johann Jacob Wepfer (1620‚Äì1695) identified the cause of hemorrhagic stroke when he suggested that people who had died of apoplexy had bleeding in their brains. Wepfer also identified the main arteries supplying the brain, the vertebral and carotid arteries, and identified the cause of a type of ischemic stroke known as a cerebral infarction when he suggested that apoplexy might be caused by a blockage to those vessels. Rudolf Virchow first described the mechanism of thromboembolism as a major factor. The term cerebrovascular accident was introduced in 1927, reflecting a \\"growing awareness and acceptance of vascular theories and (...) recognition of the consequences of a sudden disruption in the vascular supply of the brain\\". Its use is now discouraged by a number of neurology textbooks, reasoning that the connotation of fortuitousness carried by the word accident insufficiently highlights the modifiability of the underlying risk factors. Cerebrovascular insult may be used interchangeably. The term brain attack was introduced for use to underline the acute nature of stroke according to the American Stroke Association, which has used the term since 1990, and is used colloquially to refer to both ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke. Research As of 2017, angioplasty and stents were under preliminary clinical research to determine the possible therapeutic advantages of these procedures in comparison to therapy with statins, antithrombotics, or antihypertensive drugs.

He is best known as both a former member of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he recorded three studio albums, and as a member of the supergroup Velvet Revolver. Sorum is currently a member of the touring project, Kings of Chaos, and is a former member of both the Cult and Y Kant Tori Read. Sorum was also a member of Guns N' Roses side-projects, Slash's Snakepit and Neurotic Outsiders, and has released two solo albums, Hollywood Zen (2004) and Stratosphere (2014). He has been the drummer for the supergroup Hollywood Vampires since 2015. His latest project is Deadland Ritual, featuring Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler, Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens, and Apocalyptica vocalist Franky Perez.'' After performing on synthpop band Y Kant Tori Read's sole album, Sorum joined the Cult in 1989 to tour in support of their fourth studio album, Sonic Temple (1989). During the tour, Sorum was spotted by Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash and subsequently replaced their drummer Steven Adler in 1990. Remaining in the band for seven years, Sorum recorded the albums, Use Your Illusion I (1991), Use Your Illusion II (1991), and \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\" (1993), before departing in 1997 following an argument with Axl Rose. In 1999, Sorum rejoined The Cult to perform on their reunion album, Beyond Good and Evil (2001), and its subsequent 2000/ 2001 tours, and subsequently co-founded the hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver, alongside former Guns N' Roses bandmates, Slash and Duff McKagan. The band, which included guitarist Dave Kushner and Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland, released two successful studio albums, Contraband (2004) and Libertad (2007), before entering an extended hiatus following Weiland's departure. Sorum has been a permanent member of hard rock cover band Camp Freddy since 2003, alongside Jane's Addiction members Dave Navarro and Chris Chaney, and assisted in hosting its radio show and podcast on Indie 103.1. In 2012, Sorum founded a touring project, entitled Kings of Chaos, featuring members of Guns N' Roses, Deep Purple, Def Leppard, Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Cheap Trick and Slipknot. In 2012, Sorum was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N' Roses. Biography= 1960‚Äì1989: Early career = Sorum was born Matthew William Sorum on November 19, 1960, in an unincorporated area of Orange County, California that later became the city of Mission Viejo. He started to play drums after watching Ringo Starr with The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. Later he was mainly influenced by Ian Paice, Keith Moon, Neil Peart, Ginger Baker, John Bonham, Roger Taylor, Buddy Rich and Bill Ward. In his first couple of years in high school, Sorum was part of the Mission Viejo Marching Bands drum section. Sorum started out in Mission Viejo as a local hot musician in 1975. Wearing trademark \\"Union Flag\\" shorts and nothing else, he used to pound a huge acrylic drumset and overpower his first band \\"Prophecy,\\" which consisted of him and lead singer / guitarist Jeff Harris (guitarist for the J. Harris Band and later guitarist for funk band Slapbak), and bass player David Pagan. Prophecy played many gigs ranging from high schools to concerts, all the way to the Hollywood scene, where they played clubs like Gazzarri's in 1977. A local songwriter, Stephen Douglas, pulled Sorum from the band and joined him with other talented musicians, Scott Andrews on guitar and Jay Fullmer on bass, in the area to form Chateau, a wall-of-sound band with grandiose themes and sounds in their songs. They recorded their first tracks at Doug Moody's Mystic Studios in Hollywood, famous as the site where Led Zeppelin's 'Lemon Song' was recorded. Chateau played the Hollywood circuit, appearing at Gazzarri's and almost getting into a fight with the original members of the band Ratt, which at the time was known as Mickey Ratt. Sorum's work with Chateau produced a four-song set that was covered by local radio stations for a short time, but the music scene changed from grandiose rock to punk and alternative new wave music. Sorum left and went to Hollywood to play with a series of bands, including Population Five, with bassist Prescott Niles from The Knack, and Hawk, replacing Scott Travis, who went to play with Racer X and later Judas Priest. He then left on a tour around the country with a blues guitarist, playing nightclubs and bars. In 1988, he was recruited to play on the debut album of Y Kant Tori Read, a band fronted by a then unknown Tori Amos. In the wake of that project, he joined The Cult as their live drummer for the 1989/ 1990 tour in support of Sonic Temple. = 1990‚Äì1997: Guns N' Roses = In 1989, Slash saw Sorum live with The Cult on the Sonic Temple tour and, shortly after, Sorum joined Guns N' Roses as Steven Adler's replacement. Sorum with Guns N' Roses can be heard on Use Your Illusion I, Use Your Illusion II (excluding the track \\"Civil War\\"), \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\", the 1994 cover of The Rolling Stones track \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and the majority of Live Era: '87-'93. Sorum featured fully on the lengthy Use Your Illusion Tour, drumming on all of the 194 shows, 9 legs and to over 7 million fans. In 1995, Sorum formed Slash's Snakepit with Slash and Gilby Clarke and drummed on their debut album It's Five O'Clock Somewhere. Sorum also lent his drumming skills in the theme song for the 1995 20th Century Fox film, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie. That same year, Sorum formed the supergroup Neurotic Outsiders, which featured bandmate Duff McKagan. In 1996 they released their only album, the self-titled Neurotic Outsiders. John Taylor (Duran Duran) and Steve Jones (Sex Pistols) also participated on this album, and toured behind it. Early performances featured guest spots by Simon Le Bon (Duran Duran), Slash, and Billy Idol. In 1997, Sorum was fired from Guns N' Roses by Axl Rose after an argument with Rose over the inclusion of Paul Tobias in the band. In 1998, he released his first and only drum instructional video (Drum Licks and Tricks from the Rock n Roll Jungle) demonstrating his techniques. In 1999, Matt joined The Cult once again and featured on their album, Beyond Good And Evil, which he spent most of 2001 touring in support of. In April 2006, nine years after leaving Guns N' Roses, Sorum re- established his friendship with the band's lead singer Axl Rose. = 2002‚Äì2008: Velvet Revolver = Sorum in 2011 In 1999, Sorum reunited with Slash and McKagan to promote a concert for the independent film Soundman (written and directed by Steven Ho) at the Slamdance Film Festival. Sorum had composed the film with Lanny Cordola and Michael Stearns. Realizing that they still had chemistry together, they formed a new band called Velvet Revolver with former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland and rhythm guitarist Dave Kushner. After the 2004 release of their debut album Contraband, they embarked on a worldwide tour that continued through December 2005. In August 2005, Sorum broke his wrist in a boating accident, stalling the tour temporarily. While recovering from the wrist injury the drummer Brian Tichy and Mark Schulman filled in for him. In 2005, the band was nominated for three Grammys, Rock Album of the Year, Rock Song, and Hard Rock Performance for their Contraband single Slither which won their first and only Grammy.https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/velvet-revolver After taking some time off in 2006, Sorum and the rest of the band returned to the studio in December to record Libertad, Velvet Revolver's second album, which was released on July 3, 2007. Sorum toured with Velvet Revolver until singer Weiland parted ways with the band on April 1, 2008. =Other ventures= In 1994, Sorum was one of many guest drummers on the album, \\"Burning for Buddy: A Tribute to the Music of Buddy Rich\\". Playing with the Buddy Rich Big Band, Sorum was able to display his skill and finesse as a jazz drummer. Sorum released his first solo album, Hollywood Zen, in 2003. Available through his website, it was a musical statement about his life, touring, relationships, etc. In the same year, Sorum began playing with the newly formed Camp Freddy. Sorum has endorsed Zildjian cymbals, featured in numerous sweepstakes with Zildjian, and lent his talents to Submersible Music's DrumCore software. In 2006, Sorum began guest recording in his studio with a new project, called Circus Diablo. That year, he launched a clothing line; SorumNoce. On June 4, 2008, Sorum revealed Camp Freddy is working on an album. Sorum was featured in episode 54 of TV's LA Ink originally airing on August 27, 2009. In it, Kat Von D. tattoos a portrait of his wife Ace on his leg. Matt filled in on Mot√∂rhead's 2009 US tour, while drummer Mikkey Dee took part in K√§ndisdjungeln, a Swedish version of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. \\"I can retire now,\\" Sorum joked. \\"When they let me off in Kansas, I might open my own corn farm and just wear my Mot√∂rhead jacket. 'This is it, I'm done!' Axl calls and it's like, 'Aw, fuck that ‚Äì I played with Mot√∂rhead!\\"Kern, Rob: \\"What's been the highlight of the shows? That I'm still alive!\\"; Classic Rock #138, November 2009, p19 After performing together at the \\"Giving 2010\\" benefit event on May 3, 2010, Sorum formed the cover band \\"Carnival of Dogs\\" with Tracii Guns (L.A. Guns, formerly of Brides of Destruction), Franky Perez (Solo, Scars on Broadway, DKFXP) and Phil Soussan (previously played with Ozzy Osbourne, Billy Idol and Vince Neil). He made an appearance in an episode of FSN Sport Science, when a test was undertaken to determine if a professional basketball point guard had faster hands than a drummer. In 2012, Matt Sorum, and Ace Harper, formed the band Diamond Baby and are both featured in the music video, \\"The Last Rockstar\\" with actresses Jane Lynch, Juliette Lewis, and the late Verne Troyer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fps332aahME\\" In 2014, he worked with Animals Asia and adopted a moon bear that had been on a Chinese bear-bile farm, when her bile was extracted for traditional medicine. He hoped to draw attention to the abuse that bears suffer on the farms in China and Vietnam.Marc Scheider, \\"Chinese Bear Bile Farms' New Nemesis: Former Guns N' Roses Drummer Matt Sorum,\\" Billboard, 26 August 2014. He has since become an ambassador for the cause. Sorum is also an auxiliary member of the Cooper-fronted rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires, appearing on the band's eponymous 2015 debut studio album and playing drums at the band's high-profile Rock in Rio show on September 24, 2015, as well as preceding warm-up shows at The Roxy on September 16 and 17. Sorum played with the Hollywood Vampires during their February 2016 Grammy Award Performance. In 2018, at an iconic conference and festival SXSW Matt Sorum, former Guns N' Roses drummer unveiled Artbit, a distributed-ledger platform that enables both artists and fans to share and monetise artistic talent from anywhere across the globe. Artbit addresses the issue of little monetary return for emerging artists in our digitally-led music industry. Upon launch Artbit users will be able to produce live shows and performances through the platform, linking locations to any of Artbit's virtual stages. Personal life On October 12, 2013 Matt married his longtime girlfriend Ace Harper in Palm Springs, California. In a 2014 interview, Sorum stated that he became a vegetarian.

It is located off of US 206, near its intersection with Route 15, on a plot of land adjacent to the Sussex County Fairgrounds where the Sussex County Farm and Horse Show and the New Jersey State Fair are held concurrently every August, and is home to the Sussex County Miners of the independent Frontier League. Skylands Stadium opened in 1994 and was built for the New Jersey Cardinals, the New York‚ÄìPenn League affiliate for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals called the park home until 2005, after which the team was sold and moved. The Cardinals were replaced by the Sussex Skyhawks, an independent minor league team that began play in 2006 and folded after the 2010 season. Skylands Stadium also served as the home field for several other sports organizations. In October 2013, Skylands Stadium was purchased by Al Dorso, a businessman who owns State Fair Superstore in Belleville, New Jersey, operates the annual State Fair Meadowlands in the parking lots surrounding MetLife Stadium, and is the owner of the Sussex County Miners. History=Home of the New Jersey Cardinals (1993‚Äì2005)= Skylands Stadium from an aerial view. Ground was broken in the fall of 1993 for a new minor league ballpark. The Hamilton Redbirds, the Cardinals' New York‚ÄìPenn League affiliate, were in a transition to move out of their home in Hamilton, Ontario, to Augusta, New Jersey, and had temporarily spent the 1993 season in Glens Falls, New York, as the Glens Falls Redbirds. As part of the move, the team changed its name to the Cardinals. The team's new home stadium would be privately owned and financed, a rarity in professional sports circles. The park is designed to look a little bit like a farm complex from the outside. Augusta has long been the home of dairy farms, and the Cardinals wanted to make their stadium blend in. The winter of 1993-94 brought the worst weather in several years to North Jersey, causing construction cost overruns. The owners of Skylands Stadium were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but the new ballpark managed to open on time that June and the Cardinals moved in. The stadium's luxury boxes and other amenities were not completed until the following year. The interior of Skylands Stadium during a Miners game. The Cardinals called Skylands Stadium home from 1994 to 2005, winning a NYPL title in their first season. After the 2005 season the team was sold to a new ownership group based in University Park, Pennsylvania, home of Penn State University, and were relocated there to become known as the State College Spikes; it is currently a St. Louis Cardinals affiliate. =Home of the Sussex Skyhawks (2006‚Äì2010)= On January 10, 2006, it was announced that Skylands Stadium would be the home to the newly named professional baseball team called the Sussex Skyhawks of the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball. On May 29, 2006, the Skyhawks played their first regular season game at Skylands Stadium, dropping an 18-11 decision to the North Shore Spirit. The Skyhawks won a Can-Am League championship in 2008, the ballpark's second title. In early January 2011, it was announced that the Sussex Skyhawks would be disbanding. =Other teams= The Sussex County Community College (SCCC) baseball team, known as the Skylanders, plays its home games at Skylands Stadium. The Skylanders took part in the first-ever event at the ballpark, a doubleheader played on April 17, 1994. The Skyland Cardinals have also begun to play their home games in 2020 with the emergence of the All-American Baseball Challenge. In 1998, Skylands Stadium was designated the home field for the New Jersey Diamonds of the Ladies Professional Baseball League, a league for women that began play the previous year. However, the Diamonds played only eight home games before the league folded. In the summer of 1999, Skylands Stadium hosted several home games for the Newark Bears, a minor league team affiliated with the Atlantic League, as they awaited the completion of Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium in Newark. Skylands Stadium also hosted the Sussex County Colonels of the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball league, from 1995 to 1997. Skylands Stadium was also home to the Semi-Pro Football team the Sussex Stags. The Stags played at the stadium in 2010 when they were called the Jersey Stags. In 2015, the Stags re-branded as the Sussex Stags and played the 2015 season at Skylands Stadium while being part of the Empire Football League, the oldest running league in the Country. The Sussex Stags now call Newton High School the home stadium and in 2019 became the New Jersey Stags. No professional baseball team played at Skylands Stadium from 2011 through 2014. The owners, Millennium Sports Management, put the stadium up for sale for $1.99 million, but no buyer was found at that price. In March 2013, investor Mark Roscioli of 17 Mile LLC in Ardmore, Pennsylvania acquired the stadium for $950,000. Negotiations were ongoing to determine how to bring baseball back to the site with either a new or existing pro league. Roscioli did not have prior experience running a ballpark. There was interest in a new ACBL franchise or a team in a revived version of the Northern League. In October 2014, Roscioli sold the park to a group of investors led by Al Dorso for $850,000. The front entrance of Skylands Stadium. =Home of the Sussex County Miners (2015-present)= The Can-Am League granted an expansion franchise to the new ballpark owners. The new Sussex County Miners played their first home game on Memorial Day, May 25, 2015. The Miners defeated their geographical rivals, the New Jersey Jackals 4-1 in front of a crowd of 3,819 people for their first victory. In 2017, the Miners qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, playing their first playoff game at the stadium on September 7, 2017. Unfortunately, the Miners got swept in the first round 3-0 by the eventual champions, the Quebec Capitales. The Miners qualified for the playoffs again the following year, but this time, placing first in the league and winning the division for the first time in franchise history. In the opening round, they defeated the Trois-Rivi√®res Aigles 3-2. In the Championship round, the Miners beat the defending Champion Quebec Capitales 3 games to 1 in a best-of-five series. Skylands Stadium served has the location for games 3 and 4, each resulting in a walk-off hit in the bottom of the 9th inning. Game three was won on a single by first baseman Daniel Mateo scoring Mikey Reynolds on a single to left field. Game 4 was filled with even more drama. With the Miners down 2 runs with two on and two out, Miners third baseman Martin Figueroa stepped to the plate to hit a dramatic first- pitch, three-run homerun ending the game with a score of 6-5 and giving the Miners their first championship in franchise history. =25th Anniversary= On Sunday June 16, 2019 the Sussex County Miners defeated the Shikoku Island Independents by a score of 5-2, exactly 25 years to the day of the first professional game played at Skylands Park which was between the New Jersey Cardinals & Hudson Valley Renegades.

This game is widely practiced for entertainment, mostly by students in primary, middle school, and high school age in the United States. Football construction Due to the audience and impromptu nature of the game, a paper football is often made out of a single sheet of paper. The paper is folded similar to the way that an American flag is folded to form a triangle. First the paper is folded lengthwise two or three times to form a long rectangle. Then it is repeatedly folded in a diagonal fashion, forming a triangle. Finally, the end of the strip is tucked into the last fold, securing the final paper football in a triangular shape. In the absence of paper, sugar packets, matchbooks, and foil-wrapped cookies have also been used to substitute for a ball. Game play Many variations of the game exist, but generally paper football games vaguely emulate football. The two opposing teams (usually two opposing players) sit facing each other over the play area. A coin (or, a specially-marked football) is flipped to see who kicks off to start the game. After the kickoff the teams advance the Ball by flicking it across the field. Each flick represents a drive in football, with the goal being to score a touchdown. Games may be as simple as flicking the ball back and forth in a fashion similar to field goals, or as involved as including simulations of events from touchbacks to penalties to first downs. =Kick off= A kick off may start the game. The player holds the football under a fingertip of one hand on his end of the table and flicks (kicks) it with a finger from the other hand towards the opposing player's end of the table. The receiving team gets possession where the ball stops. If any part of the ball is overhanging the end of the table a touchback has occurred. The receiving team gets an agreed distance away from their endzone and play continues. There are a couple of other ways to perform the kick off; one is by placing the ball on the edge of the table with one corner overhanging, and flicking it towards the opposing side of the table. Other players use a one-handed type of kick off: the ball is held resting in the palm, then it is tossed onto the table by hitting the fingers on the underside of the table. The method used should be agreed upon before playing. Some play with a \\"wind\\" rule on kickoffs in which the opposing player can blow the ball backwards as \\"wind.\\" =Advancing the ball= The primary activity of the game is to slide the paper football across the football field by flicking it. The legal flick or shot or throw is any method which advances the ball through flicking or hitting, but pushing the ball is disallowed. The ball is generally flicked either with the thumb and forefinger in a manner similar to shooting marbles, or another manner comfortable to the player. Striking with objects such as pencils is more rare. Players have four chances (downs) to score a touchdown. They may attempt a field goal on fourth down. =Scoring= A team scores points by the following plays: Touchdown A touchdown (TD) is worth 6 points, as in American football. A touchdown is scored when a player advances the ball such that it comes to rest with part of the ball extending over the edge the opponent's end of the table without falling to the ground. If the ball falls to the ground it is considered a touchback. If on fourth down a player feels that they are not close enough to have a good chance at scoring a touchdown then they can attempt a field goal for 3. When the players are unsure whether a touchdown has been scored, a flat object can be slid across the edge of the table nearest the ball. If the object moves the ball, a touchdown is ruled. Extra points Following a touchdown, the scoring player usually kicks a field goal for 1 point (an extra point or point-after touchdown), or has the option to try for 2 points (a two-point conversion). * Point After Touchdown: The opponent holds his fingers in the goalpost position, and the scoring player flicks the ball through the air. The attempt is successful so long as the center of the ball travels through the imaginary area over the bottom fingers and between the uprights, even if the ball bounces off the uprights (but continues through the scoring area) in the process. * Two Point Conversion: The scoring player gets one attempt to flick the ball over the edge of the table in a manner similar to scoring a touchdown. The player starts from the middle of the table for this attempt. Play resumes with either a fresh kickoff by the scoring player, or a change of possession, based on house rules. Field goals A field goal is any attempt by a player to hold the ball in one hand (which in turn generally rests on the table), and to flick the ball using the other hand such that it travels through a goalpost formed by the fingers of the opposing player. Field goals generally score 3 points. Implementation of field goals varies widely, and in some variations the game consists entirely of players kicking field goals back and forth with no other plays in between. If this is the case, each successful field goal is worth only one point. Variations: * If a team gains possession in the other teams territory (such as after an illegal attempt to push the ball or the ball going out of bounds), the player can attempt a field goal instead of trying for a touchdown. The defender can place the goal posts anywhere on their goal line and the kick must take place from the exact position where the football lies, or from the spot the football left the table. * The defending player has the option to try for a field goal after a touchback. A field goal, which employs precisely the same method as described above for a Point After Touchdown, except that it scores three points rather than one. In some variations, the field goal option is only awarded after three (or another predetermined number of) touchbacks. A defender demonstrates a finger goalpost. Penalties Pushing the ball excessively, double flicking, kicking the ball so that it lands far away from the table, or disturbing the ball during an opponent's play may all result in penalties depending on game variation. Most often, a penalty moves the ball toward the offender's side of the table, to the opponent's advantage. If players are using downs, the offending player generally loses a down (or the opponent's play is considered not to have used a down), in addition to letting the opposing player move the ball to a more advantageous position. Game length Game length varies. A match may last a set amount of time such as 10 points or until the end of a class period in school. A match is often played until someone attains 21 points. Games are generally played quite quickly, especially when played on shorter tables. Various methods in turn or in combination can be used to break ties. One is \\"sudden death\\" - if the game is tied in a timed game, the match goes into sudden death, and the player who scores first wins the game. Variations * The game was known to be played with matchbooks as footballs in the 1950s in the American Midwest. * Players are allowed only one chance to advance the ball over the goal line per turn (instead of the aforementioned four tries). If a player pushes the ball off of their opponent's end of the table a \\"strike\\" is awarded and their opponent gets to kick the ball back into play. After 3 strikes a player's opponent has the option of kicking a field goal for 3 points. * Tabletop football was played in Connecticut in the 1950s using an American quarter. Each player had 4 downs to advance the quarter up the field, and hang it over the edge of the table for a touchdown. If the quarter fell off the edge or the player failed to hang it within 4 downs, the opponent was given possession. The shooting player could try a field goal at any time by hanging the quarter over his own edge of the table, and \\"kicking\\" it with his index finger toward the opponents field goal \\"posts.\\" The player with the highest score won the opponent's quarter. Due to the excessive noise of the quarter during play, the quarter variation was often avoided in school. * As the length of the paper football and the length of the table vary, the probability of the football hanging off the edge varies. * One classroom variation incorporates a study guide or test into the game. Each player in turn answers the next question on the quiz, and may only take possession of the ball with a correct answer, playing the ball from its current position on the table.

The higher the Q Score, the more highly regarded the item or person is, among those who are aware of the subject. Q Scores and other variants are primarily used by the advertising, marketing, media, and public relations industries. Usage The Q Score is a metric that determines a \\"quotient\\" (\\"Q\\") factor through mail and online panelists who make up representative samples of the population. The score identifies the familiarity of an athlete, brand, celebrity, poet, entertainment offering (e.g., television show), or licensed property, and measures the appeal of each among people familiar with the entity being measured. Other popular synonyms include Q rating, Q factor, and simply Q. The Q Score was developed in 1963 by Jack Landis and is owned by Marketing Evaluations, Inc, the company he founded in 1964. Q Scores are calculated for the population as a whole as well as by demographic groups such as age, education level, gender, income, or marital status. Q Score respondents are given choices for each person or item being surveyed: > A. One of my favorites. B. Very Good C. Good D. Fair E. Poor F. > Never heard of The positive Q Score is calculated by counting how many respondents answered A divided by the number of respondents answering A-E, and calculating the percentage. (that is, multiplying the fraction by 100). Put another way, Q_+ = \\\\frac{\\\\text{favorites}}{\\\\text{known}} \\\\times 100 Similarly, the negative Q Score is calculated by calculating the percentage of respondents who answered D or E relative to respondents who answered A to E. Q_- = \\\\frac{\\\\text{disliked}}{\\\\text{known}} \\\\times 100 Other companies have created alternative measures and metrics related to the likability, popularity, and appeal of athletes, brands, celebrities, entertainment offerings, or licensed properties. Marketing Evaluations claims the Q Score is more valuable to marketers than other popularity measurements, such as the Nielsen ratings, because Q Scores indicate not only how many people are aware of or watch a show but also how those people feel about the entity being measured. A well- liked television show, for example, may be worth more as a commercial vehicle to an advertiser than a higher-rated show that people don‚Äôt like as much. Emotional bonding with a show means stronger viewer involvement and audience attention, which are very desirable to sponsors. Viewers who regard the show as a \\"favorite\\" have higher awareness of the show's commercial content. Forms Marketing Evaluations regularly calculates Q Scores in eight categories: * Brand Attachment Q rates brand and company names * Cable Q rates cable television programs * Cartoon Q rates cartoon characters, video games, toys and similar products * Dead Q rates the current popularity of deceased celebrities * Kids Product Q rates children's responses to brand and company names * Performer Q rates living celebrities * Sports Q rates sports figures * TVQ rates broadcast television programs Cable Q and TVQ scores are calculated for all regularly scheduled broadcast and cable shows. Other Q Scores are calculated to order for clients who want to research public perception of a brand or celebrity. For example, in 2000, IBM hired Marketing Evaluations to calculate the Q Score for Deep Blue, the supercomputer that defeated chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov. Deep Blue‚Äôs Q Score was 9, meaning the computer was as familiar and appealing at the time as Carmen Electra, Howard Stern, and Bruce Wayne. In contrast, Albert Einstein‚Äôs Q Score at the time was 56, while Larry Ellison and Scott McNealy each received a Q Score of 6.

Of rivers flowing in from its Siberian side, the Amguyema, Ioniveyem, and the Chegitun are the most important. =Extent= The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the \\"Chuckchi Sea\\" as follows: Common usage is that the southern extent is further south, at the narrowest part of the Bering Strait which is on the 66th parallel north. =Chukchi Sea Shelf= The Chukchi Sea Shelf is the westernmost part of the continental shelf of the United States and the easternmost part of the continental shelf of Russia. Within this shelf, the Chukchi Corridor acts as a passageway for one of the largest marine mammal migrations in the world. Species that have been documented migrating through this corridor include the bowhead whale, beluga whale, Pacific walrus, and bearded sealsQuakenbush L., R. Small, and J.

In 1648, Semyon Dezhnyov sailed from the Kolyma River on the Arctic to the Anadyr River on the Pacific, but his route was not practical and was not used for the next 200 years. In 1728, Vitus Bering and in 1779, Captain James Cook entered the sea from the Pacific. On 28 September 1878, during Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld's expedition that made the whole length of the Northeast passage for the first time in history, the steamship Vega got stuck in fast ice in the Chukchi Sea. Since further progress for that year was impossible, the ship was secured in winter quarters. Even so, members of the expedition and the crew were aware only a few miles of ice-blocked sea lay between them and the open waters. The following year, two days after Vega was released, she passed the Bering Strait and steamed towards the Pacific Ocean. In 1913, Karluk, abandoned by expedition leader Vilhjalmur Stefansson, drifted in the ice along the northern expanses of the Chukchi Sea and sank, crushed by ice near Herald Island. The survivors made it to Wrangel Island, where they found themselves in a hopeless situation. Then Captain Robert Bartlett walked hundreds of kilometers with Kataktovik, an Inuit man, on the ice of the Chukchi Sea in order to look for help. They reached Cape Vankarem on the Chukotka coast, on April 15, 1914. Twelve survivors of the ill-fated expedition were found on Wrangel island nine months later by the King & Winge, a newly built Arctic fishing schooner. In 1933, the steamer Chelyuskin sailed from Murmansk, east bound to attempt a transit of the Northern Sea Route to the Pacific, in order to demonstrate such a transit could be achieved in one season. The vessel became beset in heavy ice in the Chukchi Sea, and after drifting with the ice for over two months, was crushed and sank on 13 February 1934 near Kolyuchin Island. Apart from one fatality, her entire complement of 104 was able to establish a camp on the sea ice. The Soviet government organized an impressive aerial evacuation, under which all were rescued. Captain Vladimir Voronin and expedition leader Otto Schmidt became heroes. Following several unsuccessful attempts, the wreck was located on the bed of the Chukchi Sea by a Russian expedition, Chelyuskin-70, in mid-September 2006. Two small components of the ship's superstructure were recovered by divers and were sent to the ship's builders, Burmeister & Wain of Copenhagen, for identification. In July 2009, a large mass of organic material was found floating in the sea off the northwest Alaskan coast. Analysis by the U.S. Coast Guard has identified it as a large body of algal bloom. On 15 October 2010, Russian scientists opened a floating polar research station in the Chukchi Sea at the margin of the Arctic Ocean. The name of the station was Severny Polyus-38 and it was home to 15 researchers for a year. They conducted polar studies and gathered scientific evidence to reinforce Russia's claims to the Arctic.Russian Drifting Polar Station SP-38 Opens In Chukchi Sea, RIA Novosti, 8 November 2010 Fauna Defense Mapping Agency topographical map of the Chukchi Sea, 1973 The polar bears living on the pack ice of the Chukchi Sea are one of the five genetically distinct Eurasian populations of the species.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Polar Bear: Ursus maritimus, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Phytoplankton In 2012, scientists from the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory published findings describing the discovery of the largest-known oceanic phytoplankton algal bloom in the world. The findings were unexpected as it was previously believed that the plankton grows only after the seasonal ice melt, yet some algae was discovered under several metres of intact sea ice.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/Huge- algae-blooms-discovered-beneath-Arctic-ice/articleshow/13923949.cms Oil and gas resources The Chukchi shelf is believed to hold oil and gas reserves as high as . Several oil companies have competed for leases on the area, and on 6 February 2008, the U.S. government announced the successful bidders would pay US$2.6 billion for extraction rights. The auction drew considerable criticism from environmentalists. In 2015, the Obama administration's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management gave a conditional approval for Shell Oil to drill in shallow ( deep) Chukchi Sea waters. In September 2015, Shell announced that it was ending its oil exploration in the region, citing tremendous cost and declining oil prices.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/business/international/royal-dutch- shell-alaska-oil-exploration-halt.html?_r=0 Shell vowed to return, but eventually gave up all but one of the corporation's leases in the Arctic.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy- environment/wp/2016/05/10/as-oil-and-gas-firms-abandon-arctic-drilling-obama- comes-under-pressure-to-do-more-to-avert-dangerous-warming-there/ See also * Arctic Alaska-Chukotka terrane * Continental shelf of Russia * List of seas * Seven seas ReferencesFurther reading * Polyak, Leonid, Dennis A Darby, Jens F Bischof, and Martin Jakobsson. 2007. \\"Stratigraphic Constraints on Late Pleistocene Glacial Erosion and Deglaciation of the Chukchi Margin, Arctic Ocean\\".

Life Richardson was born at Nith Place in Dumfries the son of Gabriel Richardson, Provost of Dumfries, and his wife, Anne Mundell. He was educated at Dumfries Grammar School. He was then apprenticed to his maternal uncle, Dr James Mundell, a surgeon in Dumfries. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and became a surgeon in the navy in 1807. He traveled with John Franklin in search of the Northwest Passage on the Coppermine Expedition of 1819‚Äì1822. Richardson wrote the sections on geology, botany and ichthyology for the official account of the expedition. Franklin and Richardson returned to Canada in 1825 and went overland by fur trade routes to the mouth of the Mackenzie River. Franklin was to go as far west as possible and Richardson was to go east to the mouth of the Coppermine River. These were the only known points on the central coast and had been reached in 1793 and 1771 respectively. He had with him two specially-built boats which were more ocean-worthy than the voyageur canoes used by Franklin on his previous expedition. They gave their names to the Dolphin and Union Strait near the end of his route. His journey was successful and he reached his furthest east the same day that Franklin reached his furthest west (16 August 1826). He abandoned his boats at Bloody Falls and trekked overland to Fort Franklin which he reached three weeks before Franklin. Together they had surveyed 1,878 miles of previously unmapped coast. The natural history discoveries of this expedition were so great that they had to be recorded in two separate works, the Flora Boreali-Americana (1833‚Äì40), written by William Jackson Hooker, and the Fauna Boreali-Americana (1829‚Äì37), written by Richardson, William John Swainson, John Edward Gray and William Kirby. At the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in 1842, Richardson described the diving apparatus and treatment of diver Roderick Cameron following an injury that occurred on 14 October 1841 during the salvage operations on . Richardson was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1846. He traveled with John Rae on an unsuccessful search for Franklin in 1848‚Äì49, describing it in An Arctic Searching Expedition (1851). He retired to the Lake District in 1855. He died at his home Lancrigg House north of Grasmere on 5 June 1865, and is buried at St Oswald's Church, Grasmere. Family He married three times: firstly in 1818 to Mary Stiven; secondly in 1833 to Mary Booth; and finally in 1847 to Mary Fletcher. Works He also wrote accounts dealing with the natural history, and especially the ichthyology, of several other Arctic voyages, and was the author of Icones Piscium (1843), Catalogue of Apodal Fish in the British Museum (1856), the second edition of Yarrell's History of British Fishes (1860), The Polar Regions (1861). and Arctic Ordeal: The Journal of John Richardson Edited by C. Stuart Houston (1984). The National Marine Biological Library at the Marine Biological Association retains some original illustrations used by Richardson in preparation for the second edition of Yarrell's book. Eponyms Richardson is commemorated in the scientific names of four species of reptiles: Eremiascincus richardsonii, Hemidactylus richardsonii, Myron richardsonii, and Sphaerodactylus richardsonii.

The area is part of the Pomeranian coast. The Zingst Peninsula forms an eastward-running spit, nearly in length, and has a width of just . Zingst separates the Baltic Sea from the lagoon of Barther Bodden, which is part of the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain, a large estuary. The shallow waters of the inlet are a major stopover for the migratory European crane. In spring and autumn, up to 3,000 birds gather here on their migration route to and from Spain. Most of the estuary and the eastern end of the peninsula are part of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park. Until the early 1870s, Zingst was an island, separated from Dar√ü by the Prerowstrom, a narrow inlet. A storm tide in 1874 closed the inlet, which had connected the bodden with the Baltic Sea. A road now connects Zingst and Dar√ü, running along a -wide isthmus. The soils of Zingst consist almost entirely of sand. The sand is white in colour, which makes it popular with sunbathers and tourists. Dunes border the Baltic Sea and enclose low ground about half a metre below sea level. The low-lying land results in boggy conditions in the interior of the peninsula, and these bogs offer habitat to a wide variety of wildlife. The ruins of a Slavic fort, the 'Hertesburg,' are on the Zingst peninsula near Zingst municipality.  Geology, climate and natural region  The peninsula of Zingst or the Zingst is the easternmost part of the Fischland-Dar√ü-Zingst peninsula that lies between the city of Rostock and town of Stralsund on the southern Baltic Sea coast. With a length of just under 20 km and a width of the Zingst stretches aways eastwards from the adjacent peninsula of Dar√ü. It is bounded to the north by the Baltic and to the south by the lagoons of Barther Bodden und Grabow, that belong to the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain. The island of Gro√üer Werder, which once lay off the eastern coast of Zingst, has now become attached as a peninsula as a result of sanding up. The land bridge to Dar√ü to the west is only about wide and right on the Baltic Sea. At this spot in 1874 the inlet of Prerower Strom, which had hitherto lined the lagoon and the Baltic, was artificially closed following the 1872 Baltic Sea flood. Only since that time has Zingst no longer been an island. The settlement heart of the village of Zingst lies between the Freesenbruch in the west, the Baltic in the north, the Alte Straminke, an old sea inlet with its surrounding marshes, in the east, and the channel of Zingster Strom in the south. The village is barely above sea level, so that it has to be protected from storm floods by dykes. Further east, on the Zingster Strom, is the village of M√ºggenburg. East of the village of Zingst lies a large forest, very rich in wildlife, called the Osterwald. Beyond that are the Sund Meadows (Sundischen Wiesen) named after Stralsund. The easternmost point of the peninsula is Pramort. = Geology = The original island of Zingst is, geologically, a very young landscape. Its formation process began with the end of Weichselian glaciation, about 12,000 years ago. This left behind a Young Drift landscape. As a result of the melting ice sheet, the underlying land lifted and the hollows were filled with water and the predecessor to the Baltic Sea, Lake Ancylus, was created. The tops of the ridges remained exposed as islands. The major outline of the coasts in the southern area of the Baltic Sea were formed by the Littorina transgression, about 7,000 to 2,500 years ago. About 5,000 years ago, the sea reached its present level and the cores of today's Dar√ü and Zingst became islands. 4,500 years ago, the salt water inflow from the North Sea reduced greatly and, since then, the Baltic Sea has slowly become less salty. Coastal erosion (abrasion, dispersal and deposition) has extended the original islands in the course of time to their present form. About 1,500 years ago, the ever-lengthening spits cut off the bays lying behind them, forming a string of lagoons known as the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain. Finally, in 1874, the Prerower Strom channel between the Dar√ü and Zingst was artificially closed. Towards the end of the 20th century the former island of Great Werder became connected to the Zingst as the strait between them silted up. This area is a windwatt. The process of land formation continues at the eastern end of the peninsula today. Zingst lies between the accretion zones of Dar√üer Ort and Bock. Sediment is transported in a west-to-east direction, and the beach at Zingst loses 40 cm annually. The loss was mainly caused by storm surges, so this process is now severely weakened. = Climate = Climatic diagram for Barth Zingst exhibits a North Mecklenburg coastal climate. The annual average temperature is . The number of frosty days is 11.1 and the number of hot summer days (temperatures over ) is 7.9. Precipitation is a relatively low per year. The average humidity is very high as a result of its coastal location. As a result the number of dull days is 146. = Flora and fauna = The Osterwald forest is the only raised bog in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, but it has been partially dried out as a result of human intervention. The tree species here include birch, English oak, beech and pine. Other trees introduced by humans include alder, spruce and firs. A feature is the redwoods, planted in 1955. Amongst the animal population are tawny owl, red kite and short-eared owl. Pine martens are also common. Settlement Zingst aerial view East of the Prerowstrom, surrounded by countryside and the Freesenbruch, is the town of Barth (population 8,000), which was created by the unification of the settlements of Pahlen, Hanshagen and Rothem ho. Hanshagen and Pahlen date to the 13th century. The nearby town of Zingst has a population of about 3,200. Rocket experiments At the former National People's Army training area in the Sundisch meadows from 1970-1992 various experiments were conducted using high-altitude research rockets. In the early 1970s, five Polish Meteor 1E missiles were launched from here. From 21 October 1988, Russian MMR06-M missiles were launched. Even after the Wende, trials continued. Between 14 February 1992 and 10 April 1992, 19 Russian MMR06-M missiles were fired from Zingst. Although further rockets were available, the launch of MMR06-M missiles on Zingst had to be stopped in April 1992 because the army needed to clear the site to make the out of bounds area safe.

It published articles advocating for women's suffrage and plural marriage, in addition to poetry and other writings. Lula Greene Richards and Emmeline B. Wells were its editors until 1914, when the Exponent was dissolved. It was \\"the first long-lived feminist periodical in the western United States.\\" While it had no direct successor, the Relief Society did launch its own magazine, the Relief Society Magazine, in 1915. A new publication, independent of the church but partially inspired by the earlier magazine, was launched by a women's group in Massachusetts in 1974, entitled Exponent II, and continues to the present day, along with a program of annual retreats, and latterly a semi-autonomous blog site, The Exponent. Goals and approach The Woman's Exponent (A Utah Ladies' Journal) was a periodical published from 1872 until 1914 in Salt Lake City with the stated aims of defending and inculcating right principles, and sharing useful knowledge, and to \\"discuss every subject interesting and valuable to women.\\" Its goals have been summarized by later commentators as uplifting and strengthening women of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and educating those not of the faith about the women of the Church. The prospectus of The Woman's Exponent cited grievances with the portrayal of Utah women in the press as a reason for the paper's creation, asserting: \\"Who are so well able to speak for the women of Utah as the women of Utah themselves? 'It is better to represent ourselves than to be misrepresented by others!'\\" Though not an official LDS Church publication, the Exponent was owned, operated and edited by LDS Church members in a private capacity. The periodical was closely tied to the Church's women's organizations, the Female Relief Societies, unified as the Relief Society. It was approved by the General Authorities of the Church, and often published news of Church events and essays relating to doctrine, but was editorially independent. Throughout the time of its publication, the newspaper, as it was generally described, covered many topics and featured conflicting points of view. It was a strong voice in support of woman's suffrage. It also actively supported plural marriage, which was a religious practice of the Church at the time. Home, family, and the overall role of women were also frequent topics. The Exponent both expressed that the \\"woman's sphere\\" in the home was a noble construct of society and encouraged women to expand beyond it; education for women was often urged to the audience. Lucinda Lee Dalton, an early Mormon feminist, was a frequent contributor. The Exponent also published excerpts from Elizabeth Cady Stanton's The Woman's Bible and passages on the Mormon doctrine of Heavenly Mother. In addition to these religious, social, and political topics, the Exponent included poems and stories, tidbits of humor or wisdom, and current news. Recipes and other housekeeping tips and notes on dress were also published. To promote a more financially-independent Utah, the Exponent \\"constantly exhorted women to consume only locally made products.\\" Reports from meetings of Relief Society bodies and other auxiliary organizations, such as young women‚Äôs and primary groups, were often included. Though it was a private publication, women of the Relief Society were actively encouraged to subscribe, as well as contribute to the paper. Format and circulation The newspaper was generally issued semi-monthly at first and later monthly, on quarto paper in three columns. Each edition was eight pages long. The Exponent was described as \\"well filled with reading matter.\\" Its circulation was estimated by the Pacific States Newspaper Directory to be 4,000 in 1888, and its readership likely exceeded that number; the Exponent was used in women's meetings and exchanged with papers outside of Utah. It was credited with considerable influence in Utah, and was quoted in other journals. History The editor of the Salt Lake Herald, Edward L. Sloan, originally intended to create a woman's column in the Herald itself. When the staff refused to support his idea, and having heard of the idea of a journal for women circulating in the Relief Society, Sloan decided to start the Exponent as a separate publication. He recruited Louisa Lula Greene as editor, and she accepted the position after she secured the approval of her great uncle, Brigham Young, the president of the LDS Church, who assigned it to her as a mission. Greene moved to Salt Lake City in April 1872, and originally worked from a room in the house of another great uncle, but later moved to a purpose-built office with living quarters. The first issue was published on June 1, 1872. Emmeline B. Wells, second editor of the Woman's Exponent Emmeline B. Wells, who would later become general president of the Relief Society, joined Greene as co-editor in the 1 December 1875 issue. They are both listed as editors on page 100 of vol. 4 no. 13; The two worked together to edit the magazine until Greene decided to take some time for her family in July 1877. She is last listed as editor on page 28 of vol. 6 no. 4; Wells was later joined by her daughter, Annie Wells Cannon, as associate editor, in June 1905. Her name first appears on page 4 of vol. 34 no. 1. Both continued to serve as the publication's editors until it folded. The periodical faced increasing financial pressures from the late 1800s or early 1900s, and Wells unsuccessfully lobbied the Relief Society General Board to adopt the newspaper as its official publication. The paper was forced to close in February 1914. That month, The Salt Lake Tribune recorded that the Exponent was \\"to give way to what is hoped to be a larger and more modern [publication], but as yet nothing has been done.\\" The Relief Society Magazine, a separate magazine and an official publication of the LDS Church, began in January 1915. Exponent II Described by its production team as a \\"spiritual descendant\\" of the Woman's Exponent, a new independent publication, Exponent II, was launched by a women's group in the Cambridge area of Massachusetts in 1974. A quarterly periodical, it is now the longest-running independent publication for Latter- day Saint women.

The magazine was first issued in January 1971, along with the correlated New Era (for youth) and the Friend (for children).Taylor, Scott. \\"LDS magazine Ensign to discontinue monthly 'First Presidency Message'\\", Deseret News, 19 March 2018. Retrieved on 24 March 2020. Each of these magazines replaced the older church publications Improvement Era, Relief Society Magazine, The Instructor, and the Millennial Star. Unlike some of its predecessors, the Ensign contains no advertisements. As an official church publication, the Ensign contains faith-promoting and proselytizing information, stories, sermons, and writings of church leaders. The May and November editions of the Ensign provide reports of the proceedings of the church's annual and semi-annual general conferences. These issues contain the full sermons and business of the conferences, as well as a current photographic list of the church's general authorities and general officers. The text of every issue of the magazine is available on the church's web site. Each issue since January 2001 is also available in PDF format. In April 2018, the magazine discontinued its First Presidency message, an article traditionally found at the front of the magazine written by a member of the church's First Presidency. This message was traditionally used by home teachers for a lesson as they visited their assigned families. This change coincided with the church's revamping of the home teaching program into ministering. In August 2020, the LDS Church announced that the Ensign would cease publication in 2021 and would be replaced by the English-language version of Liahona.McKenzie Stauffer, \\"LDS Church to replace 'Ensign,' 'New Era' with global magazines\\", kutv.com, August 15, 2020.

Their lyrics and Child's studies of them were published as The English and Scottish Popular Ballads. The tunes of most of the ballads were collected and published by Bertrand Harris Bronson in and around the 1960s. History=Age and source of the ballads= Vernon Hill of Child Ballad 2, The Elfin Knight The ballads vary in age; for instance, the manuscript of \\"Judas\\" dates to the thirteenth century and a version of \\"A Gest of Robyn Hode\\" was printed in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. The majority of the ballads, however, date to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Although some are claimed to have very ancient influences, only a handful can be definitively traced to before 1600. Moreover, few of the tunes collected are as old as the words. Nevertheless, Child's collection was far more comprehensive than any previous collection of ballads in English. Many of Child's ballads were obtained from printed broadsides, but he generally distinguished the \\"traditional\\" ballads that interested him from later broadside ballads. As Child died before writing a commentary on his work, it is uncertain exactly how and why he selected some ballads and discounted others.T. A. Green, Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 352. =Editorial history= Francis James Child collected the words to over 300 British folk ballads. Illustration by Arthur Rackham of Child Ballad 26, \\"The Twa Corbies\\" Child's collection was not the first of its kind; there had been many less scholarly collections of English and Scottish ballads, particularly from Bishop Thomas Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765) onwards.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 45. There were also \\"comprehensive\\" ballad collections from other countries. Child modelled his work on Svend Grundtvig's Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, classifying and numbering the ballads and noting different versions, which were placed side by side to aid comparison.A. N. Bold, The Ballad (Routledge, 1979), p. 5. As a result, one Child number may cover several ballads, which Child considered variants of the same story, although they may differ in many ways (as in \\"James Hatley\\"). Conversely, ballads classified separately may contain turns of phrase, and even entire verses, that are identical. The editorial history of Child's publication received a monograph study by Mary Ellen Brown in 2011.Mary Ellen Brown, Child's Unfinished Masterpiece: The English and Scottish Popular Ballads (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2011). =Bibliographic history= In 1860, Child published an eight-volume collection entitled English and Scottish Ballads, generally presenting just one variant of each ballad, via Little, Brown and Company.English and Scottish Ballads. ed. by Francis James Child (Boston: Little, Brown and company, 1860). However, as a scholarly edition this was superseded by his later and similarly named The English and Scottish Popular Ballads. The first edition of Child's book was, once complete, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, ed. by Francis James Child, 5 vols (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, [1882‚Äì98]).http://search.lib.cam.ac.uk/?itemid=cambrdgedb 3400905] It was printed in one thousand copies, and issued in ten parts, each with a half-title and title page. The final title pages for each of the five volumes, printed in red and black, were issued with part 10. Part 10 emerged after Child's death, and was edited by George Lyman Kittredge. Volume 5 contained a variety of scholarly apparatuses: the \\"Glossary\\" (V, pp. [309]-396); \\"Sources of the texts of the English and Scottish ballads\\" (V, pp. [397]-404); \\"Index of published airs of English and Scottish popular ballads, with an appendix of some airs from manuscript\\" (V, pp. [405]-424); \\"Index of ballad titles\\" (V, pp. [425]-453); \\"Titles of collections of ballads, or of books containing ballads\\" (V, pp. [455]-468); and \\"Index of matters and literature\\" (V, pp. [469]-502). The book was reprinted, this time physically in three volumes, in 1957 by the New York-based Folklore Press, in association with the Pageant Book Company.cambrdgedb 3330807 It was reprinted again in 1965 in New York by Dover, this time with an essay by Walter Morris Hart entitled 'Professor Child and the Ballad' (reprinted from Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, vol. 21 [N.S. Vol. 14, no. 4]).collpwdb 107150 Child's edition was also the basis for a number of shorter, popular editions, prominently including English and Scottish Popular Ballads Edited from the Collection of Francis James Child, ed. by Helen Child Sargent and George Lyman Kittredge (Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1904). Subjects of the ballads Child Ballads are generally heavier and darker than is usual for ballads. Some of the topics and other features characteristic enough of Child Ballads to be considered Child Ballad motifs are these: romance, enchantment, devotion, determination, obsession, jealousy, forbidden love, insanity, hallucination, uncertainty of one's sanity, the ease with which the truth can be suppressed temporarily, supernatural experiences, supernatural deeds, half-human creatures, teenagers, family strife, the boldness of outlaws, abuse of authority, betting, lust, death, karma, punishment, sin, morality, vanity, folly, dignity, nobility, honor, loyalty, dishonor, riddles, historical events, omens, fate, trust, shock, deception, disguise, treachery, disappointment, revenge, violence, murder, cruelty, combat, courage, escape, exile, rescue, forgiveness, being tested, human weaknesses, and folk heroes. On one extreme, some Child Ballads recount identifiable historical people, in known events, embellished for dramatic effect. On the other, some differ from fairy tales solely by their being songs and in verse; some have been recast in prose form as fairy tales. A large part of the collection is about Robin Hood; some are about King Arthur. A few of the ballads are rather bawdy.J. E. Housman, British Popular Ballads (1952, Ayer Publishing, 1969). Modern recordings Illustration by Katharine Cameron of a retelling of the story of Child Ballad 37, Thomas Rymer and Queen of Elfland Illustration by Alexander George Fraser of Child Ballad 275, Get Up and Bar the Door Many Child Ballads have subsequently appeared in contemporary music recordings. Burl Ives's 1949 album, The Return of the Wayfaring Stranger, for example, includes two: \\"Lord Randall\\" and \\"The Divil and the Farmer\\". In 1956 four albums (consisting of eight LPs) of 72 Child Ballads sung by Ewan MacColl and A.L. Lloyd were released: The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, Vols. 1‚Äì4. In 1960 John Jacob Niles published The Ballad Book of John Jacob Niles, in which he connects folk songs which he collected throughout the southern United States and Appalachia in the early 20th century to the Child Ballads. Many of the songs he published were revived in the Folk music revival, for example \\"The Riddle Song\\" (\\"I gave my love a Cherry\\"), which he connects with Child No. 1, \\"Riddles Wisely Expounded\\". Joan Baez sang ten Child ballads distributed among her first five albums, the liner notes of which identified them as such.Baez's first, second, third and fifth albums (released in 1960‚Äì64) included these ten Child ballads, in this order: 173, 250, 54, 84, 113, 81, 209, 243, 78, 170. British folk rock groups such as Fairport Convention, Pentangle and Steeleye Span drew heavily on the Child Ballads in their repertoires, and many other recording artists have recorded individual ballads. Harry Smith included a number of them into his Anthology of American Folk Music. In 2003 English folk singer June Tabor recorded the album An Echo of Hooves consisting entirely of Child ballads (210, 212, 161, 195, 191, 106, 74, 215, 88, 20, 58). Child ballad 95, The Maid Freed from the Gallows has appeared in several recordings of blues and rock bands, notably by Lead Belly as \\"Gallis Pole\\" and on the album Led Zeppelin III under the name \\"Gallows Pole.\\" Child ballads also occasionally occur in the work of musical groups not usually associated with folk material, such as Ween's recording of \\"The Unquiet Grave\\" (Child 78) under the title \\"Cold Blows the Wind\\" and versions of \\"Barbara Allen\\" (Child 84) recorded by the Everly Brothers, Art Garfunkel, and (on the soundtrack of the 2004 film A Love Song for Bobby Long) John Travolta. In 2009, Fleet Foxes included \\"The Fause Knight Upon the Road\\" as the b-side to the 7\\" release of \\"Mykonos\\" (as \\"False Knight on the Road\\"). In 2013 US singer-songwriter Ana√Øs Mitchell and Jefferson Hamer released Child Ballads comprising seven songs from the Francis James Child collection. Child Ballads are also referenced heavily in James A. Michener's novel The Drifters. Print and electronic editions of Child's two collections The two collections have about 200 ballads in common. Each of the two collections includes about a hundred ballads that the other does not.In the first collection there are 115 ballads that are not in the second collection. In the second collection there are 90 ballads that are not in the first collection. The first collection has 369 ballads (219 plus 150 that come under the eight volumes' \\"Appendix\\" heading). The number of ballads in the second collection is nominally 305 but actually much higher because hundreds of the ballads that Child presented as versions of another ballad (because their story is basically the same or similar) are very different from that other ballad, in many cases sharing not even one stanza. =Digitisations of The English and Scottish Popular Ballads (1882‚Äì98)=Volume 1 * Part 1, ballads 1‚Äì28 * Part 2, ballads 29‚Äì53 Volume 2 * Part 3, ballads 54‚Äì82 * Part 4, ballads 83‚Äì113; another scan of part 4 Volume 3 * Part 5, ballads 114‚Äì155 * Part 6, ballads 156‚Äì188 Volume 4 * Part 7, ballads 189‚Äì225 * Part 8, ballads 226‚Äì265 Volume 5 * Part 9, ballads 266‚Äì305; another scan of part 9 * Part 10 (glossary, ballad airs, bibliography, etc) All the variants contained in Child's edition are digitised, without apparatus, at http://www.sacred- texts.com/neu/eng/child/ and http://www.peterrobins.co.uk/ballads/. =Digitisations of English and Scottish ballads (1860)= Volume 1; Volume 2; Volume 3; Volume 4; Volume 5; Volume 6; Volume 7; Volume 8.

Thomas Rymer (c. 1643 ‚Äì 14 December 1713) was an English poet, critic, antiquary and historian. His most lasting contribution was to compile and publish 16 volumes of the first edition of Foedera, a work in 20 volumes containing agreements made between The Crown of England and foreign powers since 1101. He held the office of English Historiographer Royal from 1692 to 1714. He is credited with coining the phrase \\"poetic justice\\". Early life and education Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where Rymer studied Thomas Rymer was born at Appleton Wiske, near Northallerton in the North Riding of Yorkshire in 1643, or possibly at Yafforth. He was the younger son of Ralph Rymer, lord of the manor of Brafferton in Yorkshire, described by Clarendon as possessed of a good estate. The son studied at Northallerton Grammar School, where he was a classmate of George Hickes. There he studied for eight years under Thomas Smelt, a noted Royalist. Aged 16, he went to study at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, matriculating on 29 April 1659. Although Rymer was still at Cambridge in 1662 when he contributed Latin verses to a university volume celebrating the marriage of Charles II and Catherine of Braganza, there is no record of his taking a degree. This may have been owing to the financial problems his father was suffering at the time, or to his father's arrest on 13 October 1663 ‚Äì he was executed the following year for involvement in the Farnley Wood Plot, an intended uprising in Yorkshire against Charles II. Although Thomas's elder brother Ralph was also arrested and imprisoned, Thomas himself was not implicated. On 2 May 1666 he became a member of Gray's Inn. He was called to the bar on 16 June 1673. Career Rymer's first appearance in print was as translator of Ren√© Rapin's Reflections on Aristotle's Treatise of Poesie (1674), to which he added a preface in defence of the classic rules for unity in drama. Following the principles set there, he composed a tragedy in verse, licensed on 13 September 1677, called Edgar, or the English Monarch, which was a failure. It was printed in 1678, with a second edition in 1693. Rymer's views on drama were again given to the world in a printed letter to Fleetwood Shepheard, the friend of Matthew Prior, entitled The Tragedies of the Last Age Consider'd (1678). Here, in discussing Rollo Duke of Normandy by John Fletcher, Philip Massinger, Ben Jonson, and George Chapman, Rymer coined the term \\"poetical justice\\". To Ovid's Epistles Translated by Several Hands (1680), with a preface by Dryden, Rymer contributed Penelope to Ulysses. He was also one of those who Englished the so-called 'Dryden's Plutarch' of 1683‚Äì1686 (5 vols.): the life of Nicias fell to his share. Rymer wrote a preface to Whitelocke's Memorials of English Affairs (1682), and in 1681 A General Draught and Prospect of the Government of Europe, reprinted in 1689 and 1714 as Of the Antiquity, Power, and Decay of Parliaments, where ignorant of the future dignity that would be his, the critic had the misfortune to observe, \\"You are not to expect truth from an historiographer royal.\\" Monument to Edmund Waller with poetical inscriptions by Rymer in Beaconsfield churchyard Rymer contributed three pieces to the collection of Poems to the Memory of Edmund Waller (1688) (afterwards reprinted in Dryden's Miscellany Poems), and wrote the Latin inscription on all four sides of Edmund Waller's monument in Beaconsfield churchyard. The preface (\\"Lectori salutem\\") to the posthumous Historia Ecclesiastica (1688) of Thomas Hobbes seems to have been written by Rymer. An English translation was published in 1722. The Life of Hobbes (1681) sometimes ascribed to him was written by Richard Blackburne. He produced a congratulatory poem upon the arrival of Queen Mary in Westminster with William III on 12 February 1689. Rymer's next piece of authorship was to translate the sixth elegy of the third book of Ovid's Tristia for Dryden's Poetical Miscellanies. The only version to contain Rymer's rendering seems to be the 2nd edition of the Second Part of the Miscellanies, subtitled Silvae (1692). On the death of Thomas Shadwell in 1692, Rymer received the appointment of historiographer royal at a yearly salary of ¬£200. Immediately after this, there appeared his much-discussed A Short View of Tragedy (1693), criticising Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, which gave rise to The Impartial Critick (1693) of John Dennis, the epigram of Dryden. Foedera Rymer's most lasting contribution to scholarship was the Foedera, a collection of \\"all the leagues, treaties, alliances, capitulations, and confederacies, which have at any time been made between the Crown of England and any other kingdoms, princes and states.\\" Documents were presented in Latin with summaries in English. Begun under a royal warrant in 1693, it was \\"an immense labour of research and transcription on which he spent the last twenty years of his life\\".. The quote is from page xviii. The first edition of the Foedera consisted of 20 volumes dated 1704‚Äì1735. Sixteen were prepared by Rymer, of which the last two were published posthumously by his assistant Robert Sanderson, who himself compiled the remaining volumes, the last three being supplementary. George Holmes revised the first 17 volumes, published from 1727 to 1735, and a single folio in 1730 of corrections to the first edition. The \\"Hague edition\\" was published from 1737 to 1745 in \\"ten closely-printed folio volumes\\". The first nine reprinted the London edition, with the tenth combining Paul de Rapin's French-language synopsis and an index to the Foedera. Rapin's text had been translated into English in 1733. The Record Commission in 1800 proposed a \\"Supplement and Continuation\\" to the Foedera; in 1809 it decided instead to make a complete revision. Seven parts were prepared before the project was abandoned due to dissatisfaction with the editing by Dr Adam Clarke and others. Six parts in three volumes were published from 1816 to 1830, and the seventh in 1869, along with miscellaneous notes. The work was thus revised up to the year 1383. A three-volume English-language summary and index of the complete Foedera by Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy followed. The Victoria County History recommends citing the Record Commission (RC) edition where available and the Hague edition otherwise. Death Rymer died on 14 December 1713 and was buried four days later in St Clement Danes Church in the Strand. He appears not to have left any immediate family.

The characters, though disguised as shepherds and shepherdesses, represent real people for whose identification the author himself provides a key.

One of many small towns chosen as a site for mining development during Peru's mining boom in 1999, Tambogrande achieved prominence for successfully opposing the Manhattan Minerals mining development in the area. Compared to other regions, San Lorenzo has some significant advantages over its neighbors, including access to water and its location near the port of Paita. The city's main industry is the production of lemons and mangoes on the fertile land that surrounds the town, producing almost 40% of lemons in Peru and employing 65% of the population in its agricultural industry. Within the region, 70,000 inhabitants occupy it, and 16,000 inhabitants live in the town. Although there is no data that reports the poverty rate in Tambogrande, it is reported that in cities along the rural coastal area of Peru‚Äî such as Tambogrande‚Äî64% of inhabitants live on less than a dollar a day.Zeller, Manfred and et al. \\"Developing and testing poverty assessment tools: Results from accuracy tests in Peru.\\" Accelerated Microenterprise Advancement Project. March 2005. In 1996, Manhattan Minerals, a Canadian mining company, bought the mineral rights below the town and had found a large copper and gold deposit, from which Manhattan Minerals sought to \\"extract US$1 billion worth of minerals\\".Li, Fabiana, 1976. Unearthing Conflict: Corporate mining, activism, and expertise in Peru. London, Durham : Duke University Press. Upon this discovery, the Canadian mining company made a formal proposal to the Peruvian government, which would require the displacement of thousands and involve some harmful environmental risks to the town. The Peruvian government agreed to the proposal to mine the 10,000 hectares of land in Tambogrande for four years. Despite the promise of jobs and improved infrastructure, the population balked at the proposal. The community did not want to see the town replaced with a kilometer-wide pit because they were concerned that the mining operation could generate enough pollution to destroy the region's agriculture and limited water supply. An unprecedented protest resulted, led by local leaders of the town and the local Roman Catholic Church as well as international NGOs. In 2002, in a referendum, organized by the NGOs, on the fate of the mining project‚Äî\\"No\\" or \\"yes\\"‚Äî1.28% of the population voted in favor of it. The government would acknowledge the legitimacy of the project and called for Manhattan Minerals to end all operations.  Town Concerns  \\"En Piura somos agricultores. (Con la miner√≠a) podr√≠amos ver c√≥mo todo ser√≠a destruido para siempre: el suelo, el agua, la cosecha.\\" This farmer from Tambogrande says that in Piura, they are all farmers; with mining, it could bring great destruction to the soil, the ground, our water, and the harvest. He acutely captures the residents‚Äô sentiments toward the proposed mining project. Agriculture not only was their main source of revenue, but it also represented their way of life, their culture, and their identity as people of Tambogrande. A mining project would force them to leave in parts of the region, leaving a place they knew as a home for so many decades. Mine protest poster in Tambogrande. According to Several mining projects in Peru‚Äîsuch as Yanacocha, La Oroya, Cerro de Pasco, Huarmey‚Äîhave experienced immense environmental damage. There were some cases \\"of heavy pollution and human intoxication due to accidentals or mismanagement of private or state mining enterprises.\\" Residents are concerned that this could happen to Tambogrande and cause \\"irreversible damage.\\" Piura Life and Agriculture and NGOs partnered together to form some counterarguments against the Canadian mining company's claims that it would cause little or none environmental damage. They stated that the mining project could cause deforestation because of the immense amount of water and needed to mine; pollution that may affect the water supply and nearby rivers, such as El Ni√±o and Piura, that could be consummated; and farming production would suffer because of the environmental effects incurred. They deemed these environmental risks \\"too high to be ‚Äòacceptable.\\" Skeptical about the environmental study of the project the government would produce, OXFAM commissioned its own report and came to the same, aforementioned conclusions and described how the government's methodology and approach was wrong. Concerns were also raised about the government's neutrality in the course of dispute between Tambogrande and Manhattan Minerals, as the government owned 25% of Manhattan Minerals.  Manhattan Minerals Push  \\"Our company has a concrete proposal for development in Tambogrande. It's a proposal with three concrete social and economic aspects that will resolve many of the problems affecting thousands of children and adults in Tambogrande,\\" said Americo Villafuerte, the president of Manhattan Minerals, to the BBC in 2003 explaining how this mining project would improve the lives of the people in Tambogrande. This would be the \\"narrative\\" the Canadian mining company pushed in the public dialogue. It commissioned a report that studied the impact of the mining project and the economic situation in Tambogrande, in an attempt to demonstrate to the public to support it. In its report, the company noted the low standard of living compared to others parts of Peru, the degradation of the soil, the median income and infant mortality rate, which all suggested there needed to be a change in Tambogrande. This change, as the report would point out, would be mining which would dramatically change Tambogrande's economy for the better. The mining project would bring more foreign investment not just to this region, but to the country as a whole. Manhattan Minerals promised it would provide housing to the people who lose their houses and jobs so it would minimize any negative effects on the residents.  NGO Involvement  Protesters formed the Tambogrande Defense Front (\\"The Front\\") to garner more support among the people and to organize themselves and be unified in their direction and opposition against Manhattan Minerals. It was composed of local leaders of Tambogrande. The Front was limited, however, its outreach, organization, and resources as it was only composed of the farmers and residents. Though, with partnering with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), their voices were amplified, and the NGOS each played their different roles in the organization. Some provided financial assistance and their contacts around the world, and others helped the community strategize their future steps as they oppose the mining project. They all strengthened this \\"narrative\\" that the mining project would only bring destruction to Tambogrande's environment and identity and way of life. Some organizations that were a part of this coalition were OXFAM, CONACAMI, Piura Life and Agriculture, CREA Pueblo, the local Catholic Church, and some NGO environmental groups such as the Mineral Policy Center and Friends of the Earth from Costa Rica and Ecuador. The National Confederation of Communities Affected by Mining of Peru (CONACAMI) organized \\"up to million people\\" in protesting the \\"mining boom since the 1990s\\" because these mining companies, they believed, would exploit the mining resources of \\"Peruvian peasant communities\\" and pose a great danger to their health and well-being for generations In partnership with the community, CONACAMI launched a campaign \\"under the slogan 'without limes there is no ceviche. CONACAMI helped relayed information back to farmers from the Front. OXFAM, an organization dedicated to eradicating poverty, helped pushed the narrative further, internalized the conflict. It examined the governmental process that accompanied mining projects such as an environmental study. Before OXFAM joined, no one was aware that such a study existed, and OXFAM noted some of the flaws associated with the study and commissioned its own to give its own analysis of the project which laid out the environmental risks and the conflicts that previous countries have had with mining. It shared this knowledge with residents and international organizations that would come forth and oppose the mining project. As one member said \\"Sin las ONG habr√≠a sido dif√≠cil que [los tambograndinos] se opongan a √©l. No ten√≠an ex- periencia, la mayor parte de ellos apenas alcanz√≥ a acabar educaci√≥n primaria.\\" Without them, he says, it would have been much difficult for them to organize against a big corporation like Manhattan Mineral. Most of the members had a primary education, he says, which would only help them to a certain point. With their help, however, it enabled them to focus on their voices and spread their message and narrative. Because of the success in Tambogrande, the community's success in preventing the mining project would inspire other waves of protests throughout Peru.  Future of Mining of Peru  Peru still remains a hot spot for mining developments, having one of the largest gold deposits in the world. Mining makes up 29% of all revenue in Peru, and the mining industry wields great power in Peru. The Economist argues there is a path forward for sustainable development in Latin America and for mining corporations to work together with communities, and these corporations deserve more credit than critics give them. It notes that the poverty rate in Peru has reduced gradually with newfound development, and if mining corporations model Gold Field's practices, both the corporation and the people will benefit from cooperation. In the case of Tambogrande, it seems Manhattan Minerals did not model of Gold Field's practices or engage the community with their work which could have built trust between them and the community. Different actors in these mining development projects in Peru different perspectives. The Economist writes that Gold Field's plans to start a new mining project in Yanacocha provoked massive protests in 2004, but they ultimately were successful in garnering support for their project because Gold Fields ensured it \\"listen[ed] more than talk and ensure[ed] that living standards improve for people in the surrounding area.\\"  References  Mining in Peru Populated places in the Piura Region ","title":"Tambogrande"},{"id":"625493","text":"Magglio Jos√© Ord√≥√±ez Delgado (; born January 28, 1974) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball right fielder. He played for the Chicago White Sox (1997‚Äì2004) and Detroit Tigers (2005‚Äì2011). Ord√≥√±ez is tall and weighs . Having posted a career .309 batting average over 15 seasons, Ord√≥√±ez retired from the major leagues as a Tiger on June 3, 2012, in a ceremony at Comerica Park prior to the afternoon game. In 2013, he announced that he would be running for public office in his native country of Venezuela and was elected mayor of the Juan Antonio Sotillo Municipality on December 8, 2013. Professional career In a 15-year major league career (through the end of the 2011 season), Ord√≥√±ez was a .309 hitter with 294 home runs and 1,236 RBIs in 1,848 games. He was selected for the All-Star Game six times (1999‚Äì2001, 2003, and 2006‚Äì07) and won three Silver Slugger awards (2000, 2002, and 2007). In 2007, he won the American League batting title with an average of .363. He also established a career high with 139 runs batted in, and finished runner-up to Alex Rodriguez in the AL Most Valuable Player award voting. =Chicago White Sox (1997‚Äì2004)= Ord√≥√±ez bats for the White Sox, 1999 Ord√≥√±ez spent the first eight years of his major league career playing with the Chicago White Sox. In the five seasons prior to 2004, Ord√≥√±ez hit at least .300 with 29 home runs and 99 RBI, and reached the 30-home run, 100-RBI plateau in four of those seasons. He also collected over 70 extra-base hits from 2001 to 2003, but a collision with second baseman Willie Harris on Omar Vizquel's popup to right field during a May 19, 2004 game against the Cleveland Indians, cost him two trips to the disabled list and two surgeries on his left knee. He finished with .292, 9 home runs, and 37 RBI in 52 games. During the 2001 season when Ord√≥√±ez was teammates with Jose Canseco, Canseco claims he injected Ord√≥√±ez with steroids. During the 2003 off-season, Ordonez was almost traded to the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox and Texas Rangers had been in discussions for weeks about Boston acquiring the reigning American League MVP, SS Alex Rodriguez for outfielder Manny Ramirez. The Red Sox then agreed in principle to trade its incumbent SS Nomar Garciaparra to the White Sox for Ordonez. When the Rodriguez-for-Ramirez trade fell through, the Red Sox decided to not trade Garciaparra and the Ordonez trade was called off as well. =Detroit Tigers (2005‚Äì2011)= Ord√≥√±ez signed with the Detroit Tigers as a free agent on February 7, 2005. His five-year, $85 million contract was the second largest the Tigers had ever paid a player. Because of Ord√≥√±ez's knee injury from the 2004 season, the contract included a clause stating that if he were to spend more than 25 days on the disabled list due to the same injury, the contract could be bought out for $3 million at the discretion of the Tigers' management. After he signed with Detroit, a minor war of words occurred between Ord√≥√±ez and Ozzie Guill√©n, his former manager and teammate in Chicago. Their apparent mutual dislike for each other was a contributing factor to Ord√≥√±ez's departure from the White Sox. However, the rivalry appears to have cooled, as Guill√©n actually requested Ord√≥√±ez for the 2006 All-Star Game. In 2005, Ord√≥√±ez's first season for Detroit, he strained an abdominal muscle during the first week of the season and spent the next three months on the disabled list, as the strain turned out to be a hernia. This caused him to rest after corrective surgery for two months following the injury, after which he began a rehabilitation assignment at the Tigers' AAA minor league team in Toledo. He returned to the Tigers' lineup in early July, and once again became a star by hitting consistently over .300 while batting clean-up. In 2006, Ord√≥√±ez returned to All-Star form. He was selected to the 2006 All-Star game as an injury replacement for Red Sox Left Fielder Manny Ram√≠rez. At the All- Star break, Ord√≥√±ez was hitting .312 with 16 HR and 62 RBI, and was a mainstay for a Tigers team that was a major-league best 59‚Äì29 at the break. Ord√≥√±ez in May 2010 On October 14, 2006, Ord√≥√±ez completed the Tigers' sweep of the ALCS with a three-run homer against Huston Street of the Oakland Athletics, with two outs on a 1‚Äì0 count in the bottom of the 9th, the 8th time in MLB history that a post-season series has ended with a home run. The win sent the Tigers to their first World Series appearance since 1984. Coincidentally, it also happened 22 years to the day from when the Tigers won the World Series in that year. Ord√≥√±ez had the best season of his career in 2007, finishing second in the American League MVP race behind Alex Rodriguez. His .363 batting average, 28 home runs and 139 RBIs could be considered one of the best seasons ever by a Detroit Tigers outfielder. Magglio's records and accomplishments in 2007 include: *His .363 batting average was the highest in Major League Baseball. He finished the season as the AL batting champion, and was the first Tiger player to accomplish the feat since Norm Cash in 1961. The last Tiger to hit for a higher average was Charlie Gehringer in 1937 (.371). *His 54 doubles was the most in Major League Baseball. It was the most by a Tiger since George Kell hit 56 in 1950. *His 139 RBIs was the highest by a Tiger since Rocky Colavito had 140 in 1961. Colavito is the only Tiger batter with more RBIs than Ord√≥√±ez in the past 60 years. *On August 12, 2007, Ord√≥√±ez hit two home runs in an eight-run second-inning of an 11‚Äì6 win over the Oakland Athletics, becoming the second batter in Tigers' history to achieve this feat; Al Kaline had done so on April 17, 1955 in a 16‚Äì0 win over the then-Kansas City Athletics. *Ord√≥√±ez had an on-base percentage of .434; only two other Tiger batters in the past 60 years have posted a higher on-base percentage: Tony Phillips in 1993 (.443) and Norm Cash in 1961 (.487). *Only one Tiger in the past 60 years has had a higher slugging percentage than Magglio's .595: Norm Cash in 1961 had a slugging percentage of .662. On April 29, 2010, Ord√≥√±ez got his 2000th career hit against the Minnesota Twins' Carl Pavano. On July 24 Ord√≥√±ez hurt his ankle sliding into home. X-rays revealed a fracture that was expected to heal in six to eight weeks, but some weeks after the injury it was reported Magglio would miss the rest of the season.Magglio fractures ankle, out 6‚Äì8 weeks MLB.com July 24, 2010 Following the season, the Tigers declined Ord√≥√±ez's $15 million option for 2011.

On November 1, 2011, Tigers general manager David Dombrowski announced that the Tigers would \\"most likely\\" not offer Ord√≥√±ez a contract for the 2012 season, which makes Ord√≥√±ez a free agent. On May 29, 2012 it was reported that Ordonez would announce his retirement within the week. On June 3, 2012, Ord√≥√±ez officially retired from major league baseball in a ceremony at Comerica Park. In 2013, Ord√≥√±ez became co-owner of the Venezuelan professional baseball team Caribes de Anzo√°tegui, a team he briefly played for before coming to the United States. Nicknames and family In Detroit's Comerica Park, some Tiger fans sported curly black wigs underneath their baseball caps in support of their long-haired right fielder. This ended in mid-2009 when he cut his hair. He is also sometimes referred to affectionately as \\"Maggs\\". In mid-2006, a group of bloggers began referring to Magglio as \\"The Big Tilde\\". This nickname has been referenced on Deadspin, MLB.com, and during a Fox Sports broadcast. Ord√≥√±ez has three children with his wife Dagly, a son named Magglio Jr. and two daughters, Maggliana and Sophia. Ord√≥√±ez' son, Magglio Ord√≥√±ez Jr. was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. Political views Ord√≥√±ez was a supporter of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez, and in early 2009 appeared in a televised political ad which assured the Venezuelan people that \\"the best of the revolution is yet to come.\\" He also joined Ch√°vez on the campaign trail. As a result, during the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Ord√≥√±ez was booed by anti- Ch√°vez Venezuelan fans, during his at bats, and while he was on the field. In August 2013, Ord√≥√±ez announced that he would run for the office of mayor in the Juan Antonio Sotillo Municipality in Venezuela, on the ticket of the late Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela. It was announced on December 9, 2013 that he had been elected Mayor.

The home team and primary tenant is the New York Mets-affiliated Brooklyn Cyclones of the New York-Penn League. The stadium has also hosted other teams as well. The NYU Violets Baseball team began playing at MCU Park in 2015, and the New York Cosmos soccer team of the NASL played the 2017 NASL season there. Rugby United New York of Major League Rugby began play in 2019 with MCU Park as its home field. The official seating capacity at MCU Park is 7,000, though the Cyclones sell up to 2,500 more standing-room tickets. Prior to 2016, the capacity was 7,500 plus 2,500 standing room. Features include a concourse with free- standing concession buildings and overhanging fluorescent lamps in different colors, evoking an amusement park atmosphere. In addition, the park overlooks the Atlantic Ocean as well as the Parachute Jump in right field, and the Wonder Wheel and Coney Island Cyclone in left field.  Site  MCU Park stands on the old site of Steeplechase Park, an old-time Coney Island amusement park that closed in 1964 amid crime and general deterioration of Coney Island and of the subway routes that run to the area. MCU Park is accessible via the New York City Subway at the Coney Island‚ÄìStillwell Avenue station, served by the .  History  The stadium as KeySpan Park in 2001Part of a general reinvestment in the Coney Island neighborhood, the stadium opened in 2001 as KeySpan Park, which had a capacity of 6,500. The opening of the park, and the Cyclones' permanent move there from their prior temporary home in Queens, marked the return of professional baseball to Brooklyn‚Äîalbeit on a minor-league level‚Äîfor the first time since MLB's Brooklyn Dodgers had played their last game at Ebbets Field in 1957 before moving to California the following season. Demand for Cyclones tickets was so great that the team added 1,000 seats in a right-field bleacher pavilion within three weeks after the park opened. MCU Park and the Staten Island Yankees' Richmond County Bank Ballpark were paid for with public money, part of a deal that involved both the Mets and Yankees. The Yankees had to approve the arrival of the Cyclones, and the Mets had to approve a Yankee farm team in Staten Island. The two teams share MLB territorial rights to the New York City market, and have veto power over each other (and any other MLB organization). In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit Brooklyn and caused extensive damage to the ballpark, including the front office, clubhouses & team store. The entire playing surface, previously a natural grass field, had to be replaced with synthetic FieldTurf before the 2013 season. = Naming rights = The park's original name was part of a naming rights deal with KeySpan Energy, a utility company whose primary holding is the former Brooklyn Union Gas, until 2020. However, in 2007, KeySpan was acquired by United Kingdom-based National Grid plc, who retired the KeySpan name. On January 29, 2010, the Cyclones announced that they had ended the deal with National Grid, because the KeySpan name no longer existed. On February 4, 2010, it was announced that the Municipal Credit Union, the city's largest credit union, signed an agreement for the ballpark to be called MCU Park in an eleven-year naming rights deal.  Policies  MCU Park prohibits fans from bringing outside food into the stadium, a policy in every minor league stadium, but not in effect at Citi Field and Yankee Stadium. Baseball World Baseball Classic Qualifiers in 2016, after it was resurfaced with artificial turf The 2014 season saw MCU Park host the New York‚ÄìPenn League All Star Game. In early 2015, the New York University Violets moved in and made MCU Park their home stadium. In the process, they forced the St. Joseph's College Bears to move out. Baruch College plays a few games at MCU Park, as do a few high school teams. Following the 2015 season, a set of bleachers were removed, removing 500 seats from the ballpark. The area which housed the bleachers was turned into a picnic area. MCU Park hosted a qualifying round for the 2017 World Baseball Classic in September 2016. Israel won the Qualifier over Great Britain, Brazil & Pakistan.

Agnes Scott also owns off-campus apartments one block from campus called Avery Glen. Winship and Walters are traditionally reserved for first-year students. Upperclasswomen participate in a numeric room selection process, where students choose to live in loft-style dorms, tower rooms, or apartments with their friends. Single rooms are available in Inman, Main and Rebekah, while triple rooms are available exclusively in Main. Beginning in August 2014, Campbell offers students suite-style rooms for four, with two students per room and a shared restroom. Hopkins Hall was retired as a residence hall after the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year due to increased need for office space on campus. =Campus organizations= There are over 50 student organizations on campus. Sororities are prohibited. Publications The Silhouette is the yearbook published by the students of Agnes Scott College. All students are invited to join the staff. Aurora is the Agnes Scott literary magazine. The magazine is published once a year and includes student poetry, prose, and artwork. The magazine has also considered publishing musical compositions. Psychobabble is the student-run newsletter of Agnes Scott's Department of Psychology. The newsletter's goal is to create an informed and united community within the discipline by promoting coordinated activities and facilitating communication and relationships among faculty, students and staff. Psychobabble gives psychology majors and minors an opportunity to involve themselves in their interest and form an identity as undergraduate students, while benefiting the department as a whole and supporting the educational experience of their peers. The Profile, the college's independent student newspaper, is published bi-weekly during the academic year. All students interested in writing, photography, editing, layout and design, cartoons, advertising or circulation are encouraged to join the staff. =Athletics= Agnes Scott is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III which fields six sports teams including basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball. All teams compete in the USA South Athletic Conference (USA South). The tennis team is arguably Agnes Scott's most successful team, having won the conference championship and advanced to the NCAA national tournament six times: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015. The newest team is cross country, which was restarted in 2014 after being cut during the 2008 school year. Agnes Scott uses the tune of the Notre Dame Victory March as their fight song and to rally the students together during the annual Black Cat Spirit Week. The Agnes Scott mascot is a \\"Scottie\\", a Scottish Terrier named Victory. Traditions Mascot and School Colors The school colors of Agnes Scott are purple and white and the school mascot is the Scottie, a Scottish Terrier. Class Colors Each incoming class is assigned a class color‚Äîred, yellow, blue, or green‚Äîand votes on a class mascot that correlates with that color. The colors and mascots are intended to establish class pride, particularly during one week of activities called Black Cat. Black Cat Black Cat occurs every fall and is Agnes Scott's version of homecoming week. The week includes a number of class-focused games and activities and culminates in a series of skits written, directed, and performed by the junior class. Each class has the opportunity to showcase its mascot that features the class color. If there is dissatisfaction with a class mascot, the class is given the option to revote and choose a different mascot their second year. Pestle Board A senior-only social and philanthropic society created to lampoon the campus chapter of the academic honor society Mortar Board. Whereas Mortar Board has strict GPA and extracurricular prerequisites for membership, Pestle Board's only entry requirement is the completion of a humorous initiation process known as \\"capping\\" that pairs junior \\"cappees\\" with graduating senior \\"cappers\\". Capping also involves Pestle Board's largest philanthropic fundraiser of the year. Class Ring The class ring is given to students during the spring of their sophomore year in a special ceremony. The ring is very distinctive with a rectangular engraved black onyx stone inscribed ASC and has remained essentially the same since its introduction in the 1920s with choices only in metal (white or yellow gold) and antiquing. Alumnae who wear the ring are recognizable to one another or those familiar with the college's tradition. Students and Alumnae alike dub themselves the \\"Black Ring Mafia\\". Honor Code The honor code is held in high regard among Agnes Scott students and faculty. At the beginning of every academic year, new students must sign the honor code and recite a pledge promising to uphold the high academic and social standards of the institution. Students self govern and ask violators of the code to turn themselves in to Honor Court. The trust the Honor Code builds between faculty and students allows for students to take self scheduled, unproctored, exams. Senior Investiture Senior Investiture is one of the college's most cherished traditions. During the investiture ceremony in the fall of students' senior year, each student is capped with an academic mortar board as a symbol of her senior status at the college by the Dean. Bell Ringers Seniors at Agnes Scott traditionally ring the bell in Agnes Scott Hall's bell tower upon acceptance to graduate school or a job offer. This tradition dates from the early 1990s after the tower acquired its bell during the administration of President Ruth Schmidt. Students who ring the bell sign their names on the walls of the tower. Alumnae Pond Tradition dictates that students who get engaged are thrown into the alumnae pond by their classmates.

He was born at Besan√ßon, where his family had supplied many notable members of the legal profession. Droz's own legal studies led him to Paris in 1792; he arrived the day after the dethronement of King Louis XVI of France, and was present during the massacres of September. On the declaration of war he joined the volunteer battalion of the Doubs, and for the next three years served in the Army of the Rhine. Discharged on health grounds, he obtained a much more congenial post in the newly founded √©cole centrale of Besan√ßon; and in 1799 he made his first appearance as an author by an Essai sur l'art oratoire (Paris, Fructidor, An VII.), in which he acknowledges his indebtedness more especially to Hugh Blair. Moving to Paris in 1803, he became friendly not only with the like-minded Ducis, but also with the sceptical Cabanis; and it was on this philosopher's advice that, in order to catch the public ear, he produced the romance of Lina, which Sainte-Beuve has characterized as a mingled echo of Florian and Werther. Like several other literary men of the time, he obtained a post in the revenue office known as the Droits runis; but from 1814 he devoted himself exclusively to literature and became a contributor to various journals. Already favorably known by his Essai sur l'art d'√™tre heureux (Paris, 1806), his √âloge de Montaigne (1812), and his Essai sur le beau dans les arts (1815), he not only gained the Montyon Prize in 1823 by his work De la philosophie morale ou des diff√©rents syst√®mes sur la science de la vie, but also in 1824 obtained admission to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. The main doctrine that this treatise seeks to inculcate is that society will never be in a proper state until men have been educated to think of their duties and not of their rights. It was followed in 1825 by Application de la morale √† la politique, and in 1829 by L'√©conomie politique ou principes de la science des richesses, a methodical and clearly written treatise, which was edited by Michel Chevalier in 1854. His next and greatest work was a Histoire du r√®gne de Louis XVI in three volumes (Paris, 1839 1842). As he advanced in life, Droz became more and more decidedly religious, and the last work of his prolific pen was Pens√©es sur le christianisme (1842). In the words of Sainte-Beuve, \\"he was born and he remained all his life of the race of the good and the just.\\" He died in Paris.

It was discovered on 3 May 1984, by American astronomer Brian Skiff at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station, Arizona, in the United States. The asteroid was named TARDIS, a fictional time machine and spacecraft from the sci-fi TV series Doctor Who.  Orbit and classification  TARDIS is a member of the Alauda family (), a large family of typically bright carbonaceous asteroids and named after its parent body, 702 Alauda. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 3.1‚Äì3.2 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,076 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.01 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. In 1958 it was first identified as at the Goethe Link Observatory, extending the body's observation arc by 26 years prior to its official discovery at Anderson Mesa.  Naming  It is named after the acronym TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space), the space and time travel vehicle used by the Doctor in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. The fictional time machine looks like a London police telephone box from the 1960s. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 11 March 1990 ().  Physical characteristics  According to the survey carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS and NASA's NEOWISE mission, TARDIS measures 28.2 and 29.7 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has a low albedo of 0.055 and 0.067, respectively. An albedo between 0.05 and 0.06 is typical for carbonaceous asteroids of the outer main-belt. As of 2016, no rotational lightcurves have been obtained and the asteroid's period and shape still remains unknown.

The group was active first from 1965 to 1966 as \\"Les Probl√®mes\\", under which name they made an album with the French singer Antoine. They renamed themselves Les Charlots and remained active from 1966 to 1997, then again briefly from 2008 to 2011 (as a duo). Charlots is slang for \\"clowns\\" or \\"idiots\\"Definition of the word \\"charlot\\" on L'internaute.com : a person who lack of seriousness, a \\"clown\\". rather than being a direct reference to Charlie Chaplin, who was generally called Charlot in France.Charlot on Larousse.fr. Their light-hearted comedy style was influenced by the style of popular Italian group Brutos and by the anarchist humor of the Marx Brothers. The five members were G√©rard Rinaldi (vocals / saxophone / accordion), Jean Sarrus (bass / backing vocals), G√©rard Filipelli, a.k.a. \\"Phil\\" (guitar / backing vocals), Luis Rego (rhythm guitar / piano / backing vocals) and Jean-Guy Fechner (drums / backing vocals). Filipelli was nicknamed \\"Phil\\" as there were two \\"G√©rard\\" in the group.  Creation of Les Probl√®mes  Rinaldi and Sarrus were musicians in various short-lived groups (\\"Les Rebelles\\" and \\"Les Tar√©s\\", for Sarrus) and they first met in 1963. They became friends and decided to form a rock band, even though at the time, Rinaldi was more into jazz than rock. In 1964, they were joined by Luis Rego, then in 1965 by G√©rard Filipelli and Donald Rieubon on drums. In 1965, they became the backing band for singer Antoine under the name of \\"Les Probl√®mes\\" (\\"The Problems\\") or sometimes \\"Antoine et les Probl√®mes\\" (\\"Antoine and the Problems\\"). They backed him on two his greatest hits, \\"Les Elucubrations d'Antoine\\" and \\"Je Dis ce que je pense, je vis comme je veux\\". In 1965, while he was vacationing in Portugal (his home country), Luis Rego was imprisoned for a few months under the Salazar regime, for desertion and rebellion. During Luis' incarceration, Rinaldi wrote \\"Ballade √† Luis Rego, Prisonnier Politique\\" (\\"Ballad to Luis Rego, Political Prisoner\\"), a popular song that the group often played on stage. He was replaced on stage and in the studio by guitarist Jacques Dautriche (also a singer under the alias Sullivan). Rego rejoined the band as soon as he was released. In 1966, drummer Rieubon was called up for military service and left the band. He was replaced by William Ollivier until the band became Les Charlots.  Success as Les Charlots  After a spoof of Antoine's \\"Je Dis ce que je pense, je vis comme je veux\\" released under the alias \\"Les Charlots\\" became a novelty hit, their manager convinced them to stick to comedy and switch names for good. Except for drummer Ollivier who chose to stay with Antoine. He was replaced by Jean-Guy Fechner, brother of the group's manager Christian Fechner. For their first tour they hired Dautriche and Ollivier as back-up musicians. They became instantly extremely popular for their humoristic / parodic songs like \\"Si tu ne veux pas payer d'imp√¥ts\\", \\"Merci Patron\\", \\"On n'est Pas l√† Pour se Faire Engueuler\\", \\"Paulette la Reine des Paupiettes\\", \\"Berrystock\\", \\"Sois Erotique\\" (a parody of Serge Gainsbourg's \\"Je t'aime Moi Non Plus\\"), \\"Je Suis Trop Beau\\" (a parody of Jacques Dutronc), \\"Berry Blues\\", \\"Albert le Contractuel\\",, \\"Cet √©t√© c'√©tait toi\\", \\"Ouvre la Fen√™tre\\", \\"P√©tronille Tu Sens la Menthe\\", \\"Elle Avait du Poil au Ventre\\", \\"Hey Max\\" (a parody of Johnny Halliday's cover of \\"Hey Joe\\"), \\"Elle a Gagn√© le Yoyo en Bois du Japon (avec la Ficelle du M√™me M√©tal)\\", \\"Le Trou de Mon Quai\\", \\"La Biguine au Biniou\\", \\"Le Chou Farci\\", \\"Histoire Merveilleuse\\", \\"Chagrin d'labour\\", \\"C'est trop, c'est trop\\", \\"Ah Viens!\\", \\"Derri√®re Chez Moi\\" and \\"L'Ap√©robic\\". Most of the songs were written by Rinaldi, Sarrus or Rego. Rinaldi was the main singer and the four others sang backing vocals. After they left Antoine, they toured a lot from 1966 to 1970, first as the opening act of prestigious artists like Johnny Hallyday, Fran√ßoise Hardy, Sylvie Vartan, Claude Fran√ßois and even The Rolling Stones. One day, as The Rolling Stones were late for their gig, Les Charlots started playing \\"Satisfaction\\". Later in the evening, Sarrus said to Mick Jagger that, if they wanted, the Rolling Stones could play \\"Paulette la Reine des Paupiettes\\". Jagger politely refused. In the late '60s, Les Charlots began to appear in comedy sketches on French television, most notably in an episode of satirical television cartoon Les Shadoks, with Jean Yanne and popular sitcom Les Saintes Ch√©ries. In 1968, Rolling Stone magazine named them the best French rock musicians. In 1969, they recorded a cover album of songs by Boris Vian.  Film career  With their increasing popularity as a genuine rock / comedy group, they received many offers to appear in films. Producer Michel Ardan hired them for their first film \\"because his children had seen them on television and found them very funny...\\" Their first film, released in 1970, was La Grande Java with comedian Francis Blanche. They played five members of a rugby team whose manager stole the money. The film wasn't very good, mostly due to the fact that Les Charlots weren't actors and didn't get along with director Philippe Clair (often considered to be one of the worst French directors ever). But surprisingly, La Grande Java was a hit with teen audiences. On the set, Les Charlots met a first AD named Claude Zidi, who later directed them in their best films. The following films, Les Bidasses en folie (1971), Les Fous du Stade (1972), Les Charlots Font l'Espagne (1972), Le Grand Bazar (1973), Les Bidasses s'en vont en Guerre (1974) were all superior and very funny comedies. All their films from 1971 to 1976 (8 films) became phenomenal hits in France and all around the world (especially in India) thanks to the fact that (according to Rinaldi) \\"you didn't need to speak french to understand the plots!\\"... About their films, Les Charlots have often said that their only criteria were the glamorous locations, warm weather and good food. None of them originally intended to become actors and they didn't think their movie career would last. They just started out of curiosity, with no ambition to become actors whatsoever. Acting in films was just the icing on the cake. But they had this youthful energy that young people of the time connected to, and after their first film became a hit, they caught the acting bug. Years after their acting debuts with Les Charlots, G√©rard Rinaldi and Luis Rego pursued successful solo acting careers outside of the band. They continued to appear on stage and record albums but movies became their main activity in the '70s. Les Charlots wrote and performed the songs and music for most of their films. The films focused on the group's anti-authoritarian lifestyle and free-spirited youthfulness, their friendship, freedom, love of music and pretty girls, their laziness towards work, their numerous blunders and their hatred of authority figures like the army. The films depicted the members in absurd situations and visual gags. In Les Bidasses en Folie (1971) and sequel Les Bidasses s'en vont en Guerre (1974), they played young musicians drafted in the army, trying their best to be sent to the regiment jail rather than taking part in the manoeuvres. Their nemesis was a bald and severe sergeant named Bellec (played by character actor Jacques Seiler) who had to endure his new recruits' blunders and was ultimately always ridiculed by the boys. In their biggest hit, Les Fous du Stade (1972) they played reluctant athletes in the Olympics. In Le Grand Bazar (1973), they were factory workers, helping their shopkeeper friend Emile (Michel Galabru) fight against a brand new modern supermarket. In the big budget parody From Hong Kong with Love (1975), they reluctantly replaced a recently deceased 007 when Queen Elizabeth II is abducted by villain Mickey Rooney... For the occasion, actors Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell, cameoed in their roles from the 007 franchise as M and Miss Moneypenny respectively. In Les Charlots Contre Dracula (1980), they became vampire hunters. Rinaldi usually played the straight good-looking guy and the others were his goofy, faithful friends. Supporting actors like Jacques Seiler, Pierre Gualdi, Andr√© Badin, Paul Pr√©boist, Roger Carel, G√©rard Croce and renowned accordionist Aimable appeared in many of their films. They were directed four times by Claude Zidi who started his directing career with them. They usually kept their real-life first names (G√©rard, Jean, Phil, Luis and Jean-Guy) in the movies, except in the big-budget musketeers parody Les Quatre Charlots-Mousquetaires (1974) and sequel Les Charlots en Folie : A Nous Quatre Cardinal! (1974) in which they played the famous musketeers' valets, who were revealed to be the true heroes of the classic Alexandre Dumas story.  Departures of Rego and Fechner  At the height of their success, Rego left the band in 1971, just before the release of their second film, Les Bidasses en Folie to focus on a (successful) solo career as an actor. The split was amicable and Rego later rejoined his friends for two movies : Le Retour des Bidasses en Folie (1983) and Le Retour des Charlots (1992). Years later, Rego said he regretted his decision because the following Charlots films were extremely successful. His main reason for leaving was that he felt the scripts for their films or for their sketches on television worked better with a four men team than with five and he sometimes felt a little lost or underappreciated in the middle of the others. He appeared in massive hit Les Bronz√©s in 1978. Jean-Guy Fechner left the band in June 1976, a few months after the release of the expensive Bond parody From Hong Kong with Love. Following a dispute about unpaid royalties and disagreements about artistic choices, Les Charlots decided not to renew their contract with producer / manager Christian Fechner (Jean-Guy's brother). Les Charlots wanted to star in a satirical film written for them by auteur Bertrand Blier, named \\"Charlots, Charlottes\\", but Christian Fechner bought the rights to the script and threw it in the trash. Jean-Guy was torn between staying in the band or loyalty to his brother. He ultimately left the band. At the time of the split with Fechner, Les Charlots were supposed to appear alongside comedy legend Louis De Fun√®s in another film by Claude Zidi. The project was to be called \\"Merci Patron\\", after their hit song of the same name. Following their acrimonious split with Christian Fechner, the film was rewritten for emerging comedian Coluche (who had appeared with them in a small part in Le Grand Bazar), renamed L'Aile ou la Cuisse and became a huge hit, launching Coluche's film career. With no producer and their legal issues with Christian Fechner unresolved, the band went on hiatus until 1978 and the release of their first film as a trio, the mediocre Et Vive la Libert√©!  Les Charlots as a trio  Rinaldi, Sarrus and Filipelli went on as a trio from 1976 to 1986, but their five subsequent films, with the lack of a decent producer, lesser budgets, mediocre scripts and directors, were less successful. Only the mediocre Et Vive la Libert√©! (1978) and the camp vampire parody Les Charlots Contre Dracula (1980) were minor hits. Les Charlots Contre Dracula is the only film of the band that they wrote themselves. All of their other films as a trio misfired. In 1983, former member Rego joined his former bandmates in a supporting part in Le Retour des Bidasses en Folie, a very bad film that tried to capitalize on their 1971 hit film Les Bidasses en Folie, but where they played different characters. Years later, Filipelli acknowledged that \\"if you're a fan of Les Charlots, it's best that you don't watch our last films...\\" In 1979, the trio appeared in their first theatre play, \\"La Cuisine des Anges\\", a very successful experience. In the late seventies and early eighties, the three remaining Charlots focused on new songs and albums, releasing \\"Fesse en Rut Majeur\\" (1985), an album composed of dirty lyrics, and also some of their biggest hits : \\"Chagrin d'labour\\", \\"La Bouche Camembert\\" and the very popular \\"L'Ap√©robic\\". They still made a lot of television appearances and despite the lesser success of their films, the trio was still very popular.  Rinaldi's departure  Two years after the release and lack of success of their 14th film, Charlots Connection (1984), Rinaldi decided to leave the band to focus on his solo acting career in films, TV and on stage. Rinaldi achieved great success with sitcom Marc & Sophie from 1987 to 1991. Sarrus and Rinaldi didn't speak to each other for twenty years after Rinaldi left the band. Sarrus and Filipelli were the only two remaining members.  The Richard Bonnot era : the beginning of the end  For Les Charlots, 1986 was the beginning of the end. After a hiatus following Rinaldi's departure, he was replaced in 1987 by a friend of Sarrus, small-time singer / comedian Richard Bonnot, who had been the opening act for the band a few times in the early '80s. In the following years, the three of them recorded a few more songs (including \\"Pour pas qu'l'amour Capote\\", written for an AIDS awareness campaign) but not enough material to produce a new album. They toured very sporadically in smaller venues with little or no success, playing their old hits. But without Rinaldi's immediately recognizable voice (replaced by Bonnot's), they almost sounded like a cover band. In 1988, their old friend Antoine invited Sarrus, Filipelli, Rego and drummer Donald Rieubon to play on his latest album, Antoine Retrouve Les Probl√®mes (Antoine and The Problems Back Together) and on stage to promote it. It marked the first time that Les Charlots performed under the name Les Probl√®mes since 1966. Rinaldi was also invited but he was filming his hit TV series and couldn't appear on the album. In 1992, the reformed trio (Sarrus, Filipelli and Richard Bonnot) appeared in the group's fifteenth and final film, the embarrassing Le Retour des Charlots, reluctantly directed by Sarrus himself because they couldn't find another director. Once again, the trio was joined by former member Luis Rego in a supporting part. It was their first film in eight years. Years later, Filipelli jokingly declared that \\"that last film with Richard Bonnot was a joke, it was nothing more than an opportunity for us to go on a paid vacation.\\" (The film was shot in Portugal.) On the poster, Richard Bonnot's face was intentionally blurred to create a confusion with the more popular Rinaldi, who wasn't in the film. With almost no press and a limited release, Le Retour des Charlots was a critical and box office failure. At that time, Sarrus and Rinaldi were not on speaking terms. Jean-Guy Fechner was asked to appear in the film but a scheduling conflict prevented the reunion. The film was sunk by Rinaldi's absence, lame gags and a mediocre script. Now much too old to play young dreamers, burdened with the presence of Richard Bonnot who couldn't act or sing to save his life, the band split shortly after that. Having appeared in the least successful of all their films and barely remembered for his contributions on the last songs, Bonnot is not considered by fans of Les Charlots as a true member of the band. After the group officially split in 1997 (but with almost no noticeable activities between 1992 and 1997), he made a few appearances as a comedian on television but his career remains pretty obscure. Jean Sarrus and G√©rard Filipelli are the only members who appeared in every one of the band's 15 films. G√©rard Rinaldi appeared in 14 of them, Jean-Guy Fechner in 9 and Luis Rego in 4.  Reunions and reformation as a duo  The five original members (Rinaldi, Sarrus, Filipelli, Rego and Fechner) reunited on television in Michel Drucker's show, Vivement Dimanche in 2009. They spoke at length about their career. It was the first time since Rego's departure in 1971, that they got together in the same room. From 2008 to 2011, at the initiative of Jean Sarrus (who's always tried to keep the spirit of the band alive), Rinaldi and Sarrus reunited and toured as Les Charlots, singing medleys of the group's biggest hits for the nostalgia tour \\"Age Tendre et T√™tes de Bois\\", featuring other French artists from the '60s and '70s. On that tour and the album that followed, Rinaldi and Sarrus didn't play any instruments, they only sang. They released an album of covers from their hits from the '60s and '70s named (Les Charlots 2008). G√©rard Rinaldi died of Hodgkin's disease on March 2, 2012. He was 69. Starting in 2013, Jean Sarrus, Jean-Guy Fechner and Richard Bonnot started touring as Les Charlots again in various festivals, but very sporadically. Fechner hadn't performed on stage since 1976.  After Les Charlots  * G√©rard Rinaldi achieved great success with French sitcom Marc et Sophie, from 1987 to 1991. He continued to appear in films and television (more than 50 TV movies) and dubbed many cartoons for cinema and television, most notably the French version of The Simpsons. He was the French voice of Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum and Mr. Burns. He was also the french voice of various actors like Steve Martin, Ben Kingsley, John Malkovich, Kelsey Grammer, Burt Reynolds, Dustin Hoffman and Pete Postlethwaite. At the time of his death, Rinaldi was working on \\"Un P'tit Air de Crooner\\", a solo album with covers of popular French songs. The album was released posthumously on July 23, 2012. A few days after Rinaldi's death, holding back his tears Jean Sarrus paid homage to his friend and had this to say about him : \\"G√©rard was the soul of Les Charlots. He excelled in everything he did : he had this wonderful singing voice, but he saw himself mostly as a writer, that's what he liked to do above everything else : writing songs. I admired his great sense of humor and his ability to laugh about everything, all the time. As he was dying, he even made me laugh about his illness. I saw him on his hospital bed a few days before he died, and he just tried to make me laugh in spite of the morphine kicking in. I'm going to miss him a lot.\\" Jean-Guy Fechner called him \\"a most charming and talented man\\". Luis Rego also reacted to his friend's death, saying that he was very sad and had a lot of admiration for G√©rard Rinaldi : \\"he was so gifted that he would have had a great career even without the rest of the us\\". * After a lot of financial problems in the 80s and 90s, Jean Sarrus briefly became a TV host (most notably as the host of a show about country music in the 90's), wrote and directed Les Charlots' last film in 1992 (basically as a late replacement because they found no other director to do it) and published \\"100% Charlots\\", a biography of the group in 2007. He appeared in Josiane Balasko's Un Grand Cri d'Amour in 1998 and in a few television films. He reunited with Rinaldi from 2008 to 2011. In 2012, after Rinaldi's death, he published a revised version of \\"100% Charlots\\" called \\"D√©finitivement Charlots\\". * G√©rard Filipelli retired from public life in 1997 but is still a musician and a philanthropist. He's working with underprivileged kids, teaching them music. He often jams with his friend Luis Rego on the weekends. In 2011, at 68, he created and headlined a new rock'n roll band called King Biz. * Jean-Guy Fechner never acted again but worked as a publicist for his late brother Christian Fechner, one of France's most prominent producer. He worked on the releases of many important films such as Les Bronz√©s 3 in 2006, supervising trailers, posters and marketing campaigns. He appeared (in cameos only) in films produced by his brother or by his son, S√©bastien Fechner who is also a producer / screenwriter. His brother Christian died in 2008. Jean-Guy owns an impressive drums collection. * Luis Rego is a popular and respected character actor and playwright, appearing in huge hit Les Bronz√©s in 1978 and with comedian Pierre Desproges in Le Tribunal des Flagrants D√©lires on television. In 1987, he directed his first and only film, Poule et Frites. After his departure from the group in 1971, he rejoined Les Charlots for two more films in 1983 (Le Retour des Bidasses en Folie) and 1992 (Le Retour des Charlots), in supporting parts. Recently, he appeared in Bertrand Bonello's Nocturama (2016).

The phrase is usually only used with respect to disputed or unresolved land claims. Some types of land claims include aboriginal land claims, Antarctic land claims, and post- colonial land claims. Land claims is sometimes used as a term when referring to disputed territories like Western Sahara or to refer to the claims of displaced persons. In the colonial times of the United States American men could claim a piece of land for themselves and the claim has different level of merit according to the de facto conditions: # claim without any action on the ground # claim with (movable) property of the claimant on the ground # claim with the claimant visiting the land # claim with claimant living on the land. Today, only small areas of unclaimed land remain, yet large plots of land with little economical value (e.g., in Alaska) can still be bought for very low prices. Also, in certain parts of the world, land can still be obtained by making productive use of it. Mining claim (United States) A mining claim is the claim of the right to extract minerals from a tract of public land. In the United States, the practice began with the California gold rush of 1849. In the absence of effective government, the miners in each new mining camp made up their own rules, and chose to essentially adopt Mexican mining law then in effect in California. The Mexican law gave the right to mine to the first one to discover the mineral deposit and begin mining it. The area that could be claimed by one person was limited to that which could be mined by a single individual or a small group. The US system of mining claims is an application of the legal theory of prior appropriation, by which public property is granted to the first one to put it to beneficial use. Other applications of appropriation theory were the Homestead Act, which granted public land to farmers, and water rights in the west. The California miners spread the concept of mining claims to other mining districts all over the western United States. The US Congress legalized the practice in 1866, and amended it in the Mining Act of 1872. All land in the public domain, that is, federal land whose use has not been restricted by the government to some specific purpose, was subject to being claimed. The mining law has been changed numerous times, but still retains some features similar to those settled on by the California 49ers. The concept was also used in other countries, for example during the Australian gold rushes which occurred at a similar time starting from the 1850s, and included similar groups of people including miners that migrated from the American gold rushes. The Oriental Claims in Victoria are one example of this. =Staking a claim= Corner post of the claim of the Blue Ribbon Mine in Alaska Staking a claim involves first the discovery of a valuable mineral in quantities that a \\"prudent man\\" (the Prudent Man Rule) would invest time and expenses to recover. Next, marking the claim boundaries, typically with wooden posts or capped steel posts, which must be four feet tall, or stone cairns, which must be three feet tall. Finally, filing a claim with both the land management agency (USFS or BLM), and the local county registrar. There are four main types of mining claims: # Placer (minerals free of the local bedrock, and deposited in benches or streams) # Lode (minerals in place in the mother rock), # Tunnel (a location for a proposed tunnel which claims all veins discovered during the driving of it) # Millsite (a maximum five acre site for processing ore) A mining claim always starts out as an unpatented claim. The owner of an unpatented claim must continue mining or exploration activities on an unpatented claim, or he may pay a fee to the land management agency by September 1 of each year, or it is considered abandoned and becomes null. Activities on unpatented claims must be restricted to those necessary to mining. A patented claim is one for which the federal government has issued a patent (deed). To obtain a patent, the owner of a mining claim must prove to the federal government that the claim contains locatable minerals that can be extracted at a profit. A patented claim can be used for any purpose desired by the owner, just like any other real estate. However, Congress has ceased funding for the patenting process, so at this time a claim cannot be patented. =Claim jumping= A dispute when one party (a \\"claim jumper\\") attempts to seize the land on which another party has already made claim is known as \\"claim jumping\\".

Life  He was born in Ostel, Picardy. He was educated for the bar, but after finishing his studies adopted a literary career, ultimately devoting his chief attention to history. He was already a member of the Academy of Inscriptions and, Belles-lettres (1760), when, after the publication of the three first volumes of his Histoire de la rivalit√© de la France et d'Angleterre, he was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise (1771); and when Napoleon created the Institute he was admitted into its third class (Acad√©mie fran√ßaise) in 1803. For forty years he was the intimate friend of Malesherbes, whose life (1805) he wrote. He died at St Firmin, near Chantilly, on 13 February 1806. Gaillard is painstaking and impartial in his statement of facts, and his style is correct and elegant, but the unity of his narrative is somewhat destroyed by digressions, and by his method of treating war, politics, civil administration, and ecclesiastical affairs under separate heads. His most important work is his Histoire de la rivalit√© de la France et de l'Angleterre (in 11 vols., 1771‚Äì1777); and among his other works may be mentioned: *Essai de la rh√©torique fran√ßaise √† l'usage des demoiselles (1745), often reprinted, and in 1822 with a life of the author *Histoire de Marie de Bourgogne (1757) *Histoire de Fran√ßois I (5 vols., 1776‚Äì1779) *Histoire des grandes querelles entre Charles V. et Fran√ßois II (2 vols., 1777) *Histoire dc Charlemagne (2 vols., 1782) *Histoire de la rivalit√© de la France et de l'Espagne (8 vols., 1801) *Dictionnaire historique (6 vols., 1789‚Äì1804), making part of the Encyclop√©die methodique *M√©langes litt√©raires, containing √©loges on Charles V, Henry IV, Descartes, Corneille, La Fontaine, Malesherbes and others.

However, the word is commonly simplified to pho in English-language text. (, , ; ) is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, rice noodles (), herbs, and meat (usually beef) (), sometimes chicken (). Pho is a popular food in Vietnam where it is served in households, street stalls and restaurants countrywide. Pho is considered Vietnam's national dish.History of Pho, the National Dish of the Vietnamese Pho originated in the early 20th century in northern Vietnam, and was popularized throughout the world by refugees after the Vietnam War. Because Pho's origins are poorly documented, there is disagreement over the cultural influences that led to its development in Vietnam, as well as the etymology of the name. The Hanoi (northern) and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs. History Pho likely evolved from similar noodle dishes. For example, villagers in say they ate pho long before the French colonial period. The modern form emerged between 1900 and 1907 in northern Vietnam, southeast of Hanoi in Nam ƒê·ªãnh Province, then a substantial textile market. The traditional home of pho is reputed to be the villages of and (or ) in ƒê√¥ng Xu√¢n commune, Nam Tr·ª±c District, Nam ƒê·ªãnh Province. Cultural historian and researcher Tr·ªãnh Quang D≈©ng believes that the popularization and origins of modern pho stemmed from the intersection of several historical and cultural factors in the early 20th century. These include improved availability of beef due to French demand, which in turn produced beef bones that were purchased by Chinese workers to make into a dish similar to pho called . The demand for this dish was initially the greatest with workers from the provinces of Yunnan and Guangdong, who had an affinity for the dish due to its similarities to that of their homeland, which eventually popularized and familiarized this dish with the general population. Pho was originally sold at dawn and dusk by itinerant street vendors, who shouldered mobile kitchens on carrying poles (). From the pole hung two wooden cabinets, one housing a cauldron over a wood fire, the other storing noodles, spices, cookware, and space to prepare a bowl of pho. The heavy was always shouldered by men. They kept their heads warm with distinctive, disheveled felt hats called . Hanoi's first two fixed pho stands were a Vietnamese-owned C√°t T∆∞·ªùng on C·∫ßu G·ªó Street and a Chinese-owned stand in front of B·ªù H·ªì tram stop. They were joined in 1918 by two more on Qu·∫°t Row and ƒê·ªìng Row. Around 1925, a V√¢n C√π villager named V·∫°n opened the first \\"Nam ƒê·ªãnh style\\" pho stand in Hanoi. declined in number around 1936‚Äì1946 in favor of stationary eateries. =Development= In the late 1920s, various vendors experimented with , sesame oil, tofu, and even Lethocerus indicus extract (). This \\"\\" failed to enter the mainstream. , served with rare beef, had been introduced by 1930. Chicken pho appeared in 1939, possibly because beef was not sold at the markets on Mondays and Fridays at the time. Southern- style pho served with basil and Mung bean sprouts With the partition of Vietnam in 1954, over a million people fled North Vietnam for South Vietnam. Pho, previously unpopular in the South, suddenly became popular. No longer confined to northern culinary traditions, variations in meat and broth appeared, and additional garnishes, such as lime, mung bean sprouts (), culantro (), cinnamon basil (), Hoisin sauce (), and hot chili sauce () became standard fare. also began to rival fully cooked in popularity. Migrants from the North similarly popularized sandwiches. Meanwhile, in North Vietnam, private pho restaurants were nationalized () and began serving pho noodles made from old rice. Street vendors were forced to use noodles made of imported potato flour. Officially banned as capitalism, these vendors prized portability, carrying their wares on and setting out plastic stools for customers. Northern-style pho served with (fried bread) During the so-called \\"subsidy period\\" following the Vietnam War, state-owned pho eateries served a meatless variety of the dish known as \\"pilotless pho\\" (), in reference to the U.S. Air Force's unmanned reconnaissance drones. The broth consisted of boiled water with MSG added for taste, as there were often shortages on various foodstuffs like meat and rice during that period. Bread or cold rice was often served as a side dish, leading to the present-day practice of dipping in pho. Pho eateries were privatized as part of ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi. Many street vendors must still maintain a light footprint to evade police enforcing the street tidiness rules that replaced the ban on private ownership. =Globalization= A pho and restaurant in Paris In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Vietnamese refugees brought pho to many countries. Restaurants specializing in pho appeared in numerous Asian enclaves and Little Saigons, such as in Paris and in major cities in the United States, Canada and Australia. In 1980, the first of hundreds of pho restaurants opened in the Little Saigon in Orange County, California. In the United States, pho began to enter the mainstream during the 1990s, as relations between the U.S. and Vietnam improved. At that time Vietnamese restaurants began opening quickly in Texas and California, spreading rapidly along the Gulf and West Coasts, as well as the East Coast and the rest of the country. During the 2000s, pho restaurants in the United States generated US$500 million in annual revenue, according to an unofficial estimate. Pho can now be found in cafeterias at many college and corporate campuses, especially on the West Coast. The word \\"pho\\" was added to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in 2007. Pho is listed at number 28 on \\"World's 50 most delicious foods\\" compiled by CNN Go in 2011. The Vietnamese Embassy in Mexico celebrated Pho Day on April 3, 2016, with Osaka Prefecture holding a similar commemoration the following day. Pho has been adopted by other Southeast Asian cuisines, including Lao and Hmong cuisine. It sometimes appears as \\"Ph√¥\\" on menus in Australia. Etymology and origins Reviews of 19th and 20th century Vietnamese literature have found that pho entered the mainstream sometime in the 1910s. Ph·∫°m ƒê√¨nh H·ªï's 1827 H√°n-N√¥m dictionary Nh·∫≠t d·ª•ng th∆∞·ªùng ƒë√†m includes an entry for rice noodles () with the definition ÁæÖ©õÑÊôÆ§ô≠ (), borrowing a character ordinarily pronounced \\"ph·ªï\\" or \\"ph∆°\\" to refer to pho. Georges Dumoutier's extensive 1907 account of Vietnamese cuisine omits any mention of pho, while Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Hoan recalls its sale by street vendors in 1913. A 1931 dictionary is the first to define as a soup: \\"from the word . A dish consisting of small slices of rice cake boiled with beef.\\" Translated into the English: Possibly the earliest English-language reference to pho was in the book Recipes of All Nations, edited by Countess Morphy in 1935: In the book, pho is described as \\"an Annamese soup held in high esteem ... made with beef, a veal bone, onions, a bayleaf, salt, and pepper, and a small teaspoon of nuoc-mam'.\\" There are two prevailing theories on the origin of the word and, by extension, the dish itself. As author Nguy·ªÖn D∆∞ notes, both questions are significant to Vietnamese identity. =From French= French settlers commonly ate beef, whereas Vietnamese traditionally ate pork and chicken and used cattle as beasts of burden. Gustave Hue (1937) equates to the French beef stew (literally, \\"pot on the fire\\"). Accordingly, Western sources generally maintain that is derived from in both name and substance.Bloom, Dan, \\"What's that Pho? - French loan words in Vietnam hark back to the colonial days\\" Taipei Times, May 29, 2010. However, several scholars dispute this etymology on the basis of the stark differences between the two dishes. Another suggestion of a separate origin is that pho in French has long been pronounced rather than : in Jean Tardieu's Lettre de Hano√Ø √† Roger Martin Du Gard (1928), a soup vendor cries \\"Pho-√¥!\\" in the street. Many Hanoians explain that the word derives from French soldiers' ordering \\"\\" (fire) from , referring to both the steam rising from a bowl of pho and the wood fire seen glowing from a in the evening. Food historian Erica J. Peters argues that the French have embraced pho in a way that overlooks its origins as a local improvisation, reinforcing \\"an idea that the French brought modern ingenuity to a traditionalist Vietnam\\". =From Cantonese= Hue and Eug√®n Gouin (1957) both define by itself as an abbreviation of . Elucidating on the 1931 dictionary, Gouin and L√™ Ng·ªçc Tr·ª• (1970) both give as a corruption of (), which was commonly sold by Chinese immigrants in Hanoi. ( is an allophone of in some northern dialects of Vietnamese.) Some scholars argue that pho (the dish) evolved from , a Vietnamese dish common in Hanoi at the turn of the century. Originally eaten by commoners near the Red River, it consisted of stir-fried strips of water buffalo meat served in broth atop rice vermicelli. Around 1908‚Äì1909, the shipping industry brought an influx of laborers. Vietnamese and Chinese cooks set up to serve them but later switched to inexpensive scraps of beef set aside by butchers who sold to the French. Chinese vendors advertised this by crying out, \\"Beef and noodles!\\" (). Eventually the street cry became \\"Meat and noodles!\\" (), with the last syllable elongated. Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc B√≠ch suggests that the final \\"n\\" was eventually dropped because of the similar- sounding (). The French author Jean Marquet refers to the dish as \\"!\\" in his 1919 novel Du village-√†-la cit√©. This is likely what the Vietnamese poet T·∫£n ƒê√† calls \\"\\" in \\"\\" (\\"Gambling\\"), written around 1915‚Äì1917. Ph·ªü uses a common Chinese Rice noodle called () which is believed to have originated in Shahe, Guangdong, China.Shahe fen The Cantonese also use the word () as well as () to describe Ph·ªü. The two words share close approximation and could be a cognate of one another when considering varying regional and dialectical pronunciation differences. Ingredients and preparation Pho is served in a bowl with a specific cut of flat rice noodles in clear beef broth, with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket). Variations feature slow-cooked tendon, tripe, or meatballs in southern Vietnam. Chicken pho is made using the same spices as beef, but the broth is made using chicken bones and meat, as well as some internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs, and the gizzard. When eating at ph·ªü stalls in Vietnam, customers are generally asked which parts of the beef they would like and how they want it done. Beef parts including: *T√°i bƒÉm: Rare beef patty, beef is minced by a chopping knife right before serving *T√°i: Medium Rare Meat *T√°i s·ªëng: Rare meat *T√°i ch√≠n: Mixture of medium rare meat and pre-cooked well- done meat, the default serving in most pho restaurants *T√°i lƒÉn: Meat is sauteed before adding to the soup *T√°i n·∫°m: Mix of medium rare meat with flank *N·∫°m: Flank cut *N·∫°m g·∫ßu: Brisket *G√¢n: Tendons *S√°ch: Beef tripe *Ti·∫øt: Boiled beef blood *B√≤ vi√™n: Beef ball *Tr·ª©ng t√°i: Poached chicken egg (served in a separated bowl) For chicken ph·ªü, options might include: *G√† ƒë√πi: Chicken thigh *G√† l∆∞·ªùn: Chicken breast *L√≤ng g√†: Chicken innards *Tr·ª©ng non: Immature chicken eggs =Noodles= Bags of at an American grocery store The thick dried rice noodle that is usually used is called , but some versions may be made with freshly made rice noodles called in Vietnamese or kuay tiao. These noodles are labeled on packaging as (fresh pho noodles) in Vietnamese, (fresh Chaozhou kuy teav) in Chinese, (Vietnamese rice noodle) in Korean, and (thin kuy teav) in Thai. The pho noodle are usually medium-width, however, people from different region of Vietnam will prefer different widths. =Broth= Pho served with beef brisket The soup for beef pho is generally made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones may still have beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef. A typical pho spice packet, sold at many Asian food markets, containing a soaking bag plus various necessary dry spices. The exact amount differs with each bag. The spices, often wrapped in cheesecloth or a soaking bag to prevent them from floating all over the pot, usually contain cloves, star anise, coriander seed, fennel, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger, and onion. Careful cooks often roast ginger and onion over an open fire for about a minute before adding them to the stock, to bring out their full flavor. They also skim off all the impurities that float to the top while cooking; this is the key to a clear broth. (fish sauce) is added toward the end. =Garnishes= culantro, lime, bean sprouts, and Thai basil. Vietnamese dishes are typically served with many greens, herbs, vegetables, and various other accompaniments, such as dipping sauces, hot and spicy pastes such as Sriracha, and a squeeze of lime or lemon juice; it may also be served with hoisin sauce. The dish is garnished with ingredients such as green onions, white onions, Thai basil (not to be confused with sweet basil), fresh Thai chili peppers, lemon or lime wedges, bean sprouts, and cilantro (coriander leaves) or culantro. Fish sauce, hoisin sauce, chili oil and hot chili sauce (such as Sriracha sauce) may be added to taste as accompaniments. Several ingredients not generally served with pho may be ordered by request. Extra-fatty broth (n∆∞·ªõc b√©o) can be ordered and comes with scallions to sweeten it. A popular side dish ordered upon request is h√†nh d·∫•m, or vinegared white onions. Styles of pho=Regional variants= Chicken pho at a typical street stall in Hanoi. The lack of side garnishes is typical of northern Vietnamese-style cooking. The several regional variants of pho in Vietnam, particularly divided between \\"Northern pho\\" (') and \\"southern pho\\" or \\"Saigon pho\\" ('). Northern pho by the use of fatty stock, blanched whole green onion, and garnishes offered generally include only diced green onion and cilantro, garlic, chili sauce and qu·∫©y. On the other hand, southern Vietnamese pho broth is a clearer stock and is consumed with bean sprouts, fresh sliced chili, hoisin sauce and a greater variety of fresh herbs. Pho may be served with either pho noodles or kuy teav noodles (). The variations in meat, broth, and additional garnishes such as lime, bean sprouts, ng√≤ gai (Eryngium foetidum), h√∫ng qu·∫ø (Thai/Asian basil), and t∆∞∆°ng ƒëen (bean sauce/hoisin sauce), t∆∞∆°ng ·ªõt (hot chili sauce, e.g., Sriracha sauce) appear to be innovations made by or introduced to the South. Another style of northern ph·ªü is Ph·ªü Nam ƒê·ªãnh from Nam ƒê·ªãnh city. Other provincial variations exist where pho is served with delicacy meats other than beef or chicken such as duck, buffalo, goat or veal. =Other ph·ªü dishes= Ph·ªü has many variants including many dishes bearing the name \\"ph·ªü\\", many are not soup-based: *Hanoi specialties: Ph·ªü s·ªët vang: Wine-sauced pho, with beef stewed in red wine. Ph·ªü x√†o: sauteed pho noodles with beef and vegetables. Ph·ªü √°p ch·∫£o: similar to ph·ªü x√†o but stir-fried with more oil and gets more burned. Ph·ªü cu·ªën: ph·ªü ingredients rolled up and eaten as a g·ªèi cu·ªën. Ph·ªü tr·ªôn (mixed Pho): pho noodles and fresh herbs and dressings, served as a salad. *Other provinces: Ph·ªü chua: meaning sour ph·ªü is a delicacy from L·∫°ng S∆°n city. Ph·ªü kh√¥ Gia Lai: an unrelated soup dish from Gia Lai. Ph·ªü s·∫Øn: a tapioca noodle dish from Qu·∫ø S∆°n District, Qu·∫£ng Nam. It is closer to m√¨ Qu·∫£ng. Ph·ªü sa t·∫ø: pho noodles with chili and peanut sauce, came from Teochew immigrants in southern Vietnam. Ph·ªü v·ªãt: duck pho, a specialty of Cao Bang province. Ph·ªü gan ch√°y: meaning grilled liver pho, a specialty found in B·∫Øc Ninh city. International variants include pho made using unconventional ingredients such as seafood, tofu and vegetable broth for vegetarians (), and a larger variety of vegetables, such as carrots and broccoli. Vietnamese beef soup can also refer to , which is a spicy beef noodle soup, is associated with in central Vietnam. Notable restaurants Tables at pho restaurants abroad are set with a variety of condiments, including Sriracha sauce, and eating utensils. Famous pho shops in Hanoi are Ph·ªü Gia Truy·ªÅn, Ph·ªü Th√¨n, Ph·ªü L√Ω Qu·ªëc S∆∞. Famous pho shops in Saigon included , , , , and . Pasteur Street () was a street famous for its beef pho, while Hien Vuong Street () was known for its chicken pho. At Ph·ªü B√¨nh, American soldiers dined as Vi·ªát C·ªông agents planned the T·∫øt Offensive just upstairs. Nowadays in Ho Chi Minh City, well known restaurants include: Ph·ªü H√πng, Ph·ªü H√≤a Pasteur and Ph·ªü 2000, which U.S. President Bill Clinton visited in 2000. One of the largest pho chain in Vietnam is Pho 24, a subsidiary of Highlands Coffee, with 60 locations in Vietnam and 20 abroad. The largest pho chain in the United States is Ph·ªü H√≤a, which operates over 70 locations in seven countries. A similar restaurant named Pho 75 serves in the Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania areas in the United States.. Many pho restaurants in the United States offer oversized helpings with names such as \\"train pho\\" (), \\"airplane pho\\" (), or \\"California pho\\" (). Some restaurants have offered a pho eating challenge, with prizes for finishing as much as of pho in one sitting, or have auctioned special versions costing $5,000.

Missing lyric The full lyrics were a subject of speculation for several years until they were revealed to fans by band members and cast members of the show.

The terms were later confirmed by the March 1801 Treaty of Aranjuez. Background For much of the 18th century, France and Spain were allies, but after the execution of Louis XVI in 1793, Spain joined the War of the First Coalition against the French Republic but was defeated in the War of the Pyrenees. In August 1795, Spain and France agreed to the Peace of Basel, with Spain ceding its half of the island of Hispaniola, the modern Dominican Republic. Charles Talleyrand, long-serving French Foreign Minister; the Treaty was part of a complex web of related agreements In the 1797 Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain allied with France in the War of the Second Coalition and declared war on Britain. This resulted in the loss of Trinidad and, more seriously, Menorca, which Britain occupied from 1708‚Äì1782 and whose recovery was the major achievement of Spain's participation in the 1778‚Äì1783 Anglo-French War. Its loss damaged the prestige of the Spanish government, while the British naval blockade severely impacted the economy, which was highly dependent on trade with its South American colonies, particularly the import of silver from Mexico. The effect was to place the Spanish government under severe political and financial pressure, the national debt increasing eightfold between 1793 and 1798. Louisiana was only part of Spain's immense empire in the Americas, which it received as a result of the 1763 Treaty of Paris, when France ceded it as compensation for Spanish concessions to Britain elsewhere. Preventing encroachment by American settlers into the Mississippi Basin was costly and risked conflict with the U.S., whose merchant ships Spain relied on to evade the British blockade. Colonies were viewed as valuable assets; the loss of the sugar-producing colonies of Haiti (Saint-Domingue), Martinique, and Guadeloupe between 1791‚Äì1794 had a huge impact on French business. Restoring them was a priority, and when Napoleon seized power in the November 1799 Coup of 18 Brumaire, he and his deputy Charles Talleyrand stressed the need for French expansion overseas. Their strategy had a number of parts, one being the 1798‚Äì1801 Egyptian campaign, intended in part to strengthen French trading interests in the region. In South America, Talleyrand sought to move the border between French Guiana and Portuguese Brazil south to the Araguari or Amap√° River, taking in large parts of Northern Brazil. Terms were contained in the draft 1797 Treaty of Paris which was never approved although similar conditions were imposed on Portugal in the 1801 Treaty of Madrid. A third was the restoration of New France in North America, lost after the 1756‚Äì1763 Seven Years' War, with Louisiana providing raw materials for French plantations in the Caribbean. The combination of French ambition and Spanish weakness made the return of Louisiana attractive to both, especially as Spain was being drawn into disputes with the U.S. over navigation rights on the Mississippi River. Talleyrand claimed French possession of Louisiana would allow them to protect Spanish South America from both Britain and the U.S. Provisions Mariano Luis de Urquijo, Spanish signatory The Treaty was negotiated by French general Louis-Alexandre Berthier and the Spanish former Chief Minister Mariano Luis de Urquijo. In addition to Louisiana, Berthier was instructed to demand the Spanish colonies of East Florida and West Florida, plus ten Spanish warships. Urquijo rejected the request for the Floridas but agreed to Louisiana plus \\"...six ships of war in good condition built for seventy-four guns, armed and equipped and ready to receive French crews and supplies.\\" In return, Charles IV wanted compensation for his son-in-law Louis, Infanta Duke of Parma, since France wanted to annex his inheritance of the Duchy of Parma. Details were vague, Clause II of the Treaty simply stating \\"it may consist of Tuscany...or the three Roman legations or of any other continental provinces of Italy which form a rounded state.\\" Urquijo insisted Spain would hand over Louisiana and the ships only once France confirmed which Italian territories it would receive in return. Finally, the terms reaffirmed the alliance between France and Spain agreed upon in the 1796 Second Treaty of San Ildefonso. Aftermath On 9 February 1801, France and the Austrian Emperor Francis II signed the Treaty of Lun√©ville, clearing the way for the Treaty of Aranjuez in March 1801. This confirmed the preliminary terms agreed at Ildefonso and created the short-lived Kingdom of Etruria for Maria Luisa's son-in-law Louis. Spain's Chief Minister Manuel Godoy was excoriated for the terms, which were seen as excessively benefiting France; he later justified it at length in his Memoirs. Modern historians are less critical, since Spain exercised effective control only over a small part of the territory included in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase while an attempt to control U.S. expansion into Spanish territories by the 1795 Pinckney's Treaty proved ineffective. Louis Berthier, French signatory From 1798‚Äì1800, France and the U.S. waged an undeclared war at sea, the so-called Quasi-War, which was ended by the Convention of 1800 or Treaty of Mortefontaine. With an already hostile British Canada to the north, the U.S. wanted to avoid an aggressive and powerful France replacing Spain in the south. For commercial reasons, Napoleon wanted to reestablish France's presence in North America, the November 1801 Saint-Domingue expedition being the first step. The March 1802 Treaty of Amiens ended the War of the Second Coalition and in October, Spain transferred Louisiana to France. While the presence of 30,000 French troops and sailors in the Caribbean initially caused great concern in the U.S., by October 1802 it was clear the expedition was a catastrophic failure; its leader, General Charles Leclerc died of yellow fever, along with an estimated 29,000 men by mid-summer. Without Saint- Domingue, Napoleon concluded Louisiana was irrelevant, and with France and Britain once again on the verge of hostilities, he decided to sell the territory to prevent it from being annexed by British forces garrisoned in nearby Canada. In April 1803, the U.S. purchased the territory for $15 million, or 80 million francs. The elaborate shuffling of Italian territories was ultimately futile. Etruria was dissolved and incorporated into France in 1807, while much of pre-Napoleonic Italy was restored by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, including the Grand Duchies of Tuscany and Parma.

He was born in Altona (near Hamburg) on 27 August 1862. He came from a prominent Jewish family that had lived in the vicinity of Hamburg for generations; his grandfather, Akiba Wertheimer, was chief Rabbi of Altona and Schleswig-Holstein. Brunner studied philosophy under a number of prominent scholars, but never completed his doctorate. He established himself as a literary critic, and enjoyed a wide celebrity. In the 1890s, he withdrew from public life to devote himself to writing. He lived in Germany until 1933, when, with the rise to power of the Nazi party, he moved to The Hague, where he died on 27 August 1937. Doctrine Central to Brunner's theory is the characterization of three different modes of mental activity: Schema of Brunner's doctrine # Practical reason, which every human possesses, and which serves one's normal needs # Spiritual/intellectual (geistig) thought, which rises above the relative truth residing in experience and in science, and strives toward a perception of the one eternal and absolute essence. # \\"Superstition\\"‚Äîpseudo- contemplation, which is the mode of contemplation of most ordinary men. Unfounded belief is a distortion of the spiritual faculty. While practical reason recognizes that the \\"relative\\" is only \\"relative,\\" superstition elevates what is relative to the status of the absolute. Each of the three modes of thought consists of three specificates. In the practical understanding, the specificates are feeling, knowing and willing. In spiritual life, these are modified to become, respectively, art, philosophy and mysticism (love). Superstition distorts the specificates of spiritual life, transforming them into religion, metaphysics and moralism. Brunner's intention is to contrast popular thought with spiritual/intellectual thought. His work Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volke is a survey of the whole of human intellectual history seen from the point of view of this doctrine. Brunner's ultimate objective was to prepare the way for the establishment of a community centered on the life of the mind, which would in turn open the way to the expansion of democracy. Brunner and Judaism The opposition between the spiritual and the religious is a major theme in Brunner's work. He contends that Judaism is essentially anti-religious, stating in Our Christ that \\"Judaism as a spiritual doctrine is the opposite of religion and a protest against it\\", and culminates his argument with his own translation of the Shema: \\"Hear O Israel, Being is our god, Being is one\\". He juxtaposes priestly/pharisaic/rabbinic to prophetic Judaism, stating that the latter represents the true mystical essence in opposition to the former which distorts that essence. Brunner and Christianity For Brunner, Jesus was both a mystic and a genius, whereas Christian religion is largely a distortion of his thought. Brunner and Israel Throughout his life, Brunner was anti- Zionist. However, there is evidence that, toward the end of his life in light of events in Europe, he was reconsidering his opposition to the founding of the state of Israel (see Assimilation und Nationalismus: ein Briefwechsel mit Constantin Brunner / Willy Aron). Brunner and the history of philosophy According to Brunner, the authentic philosophy presented by Spinoza has its antithesis in scholasticism which reaches its highest expression in Immanuel Kant. Thus Spinoza and Kant represent opposite poles in the dialectical idealism by which Brunner organizes the whole of intellectual history. Brunner and science Brunner maintains that the foundation of all science is the doctrine of universal all-motion. His elaboration of this doctrine has had a decisive effect on a number of medical practitioners and researchers. Brunner and evolution Brunner's position is that the fixity of the genus is a scientific principle that needs to be preserved if meaningful work is to be undertaken with biological systems. He argued that because the theory of evolution undermined the notion of genus, it would be detrimental to practical scientific endeavor. Influence and relevance In Confessions of a European Intellectual, Franz Schoenberner describes Brunner as \\"one of the more important figures\\" in Europe. Brunner corresponded with Walther Rathenau, Martin Buber, Gustav Landauer and Lou Andreas-Salom√©. Albert Einstein read Brunner but, while appreciating his critical insight and sharing his devotion to Spinoza, rejected his philosophy, particularly where it stood opposed to Immanuel KantEinstein to W. Aron, 14 January 1943. Einstein Archive, reel 33-296 Einstein-Aron correspondence, Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew University, Jerusalem Brunner attracted a large and devoted following among the Jewish youth in Czernowitz. The best known of his disciples in this group is the poet, Rose Ausl√§nder. With the Second World War, Brunner's books were burned and his devotees scattered. His German disciple Magdalena Kasch managed to save the bulk of Brunner's writing from destruction by the Nazis. In 1948, she, with the help of some of Brunner's other surviving friends, founded the \\"Internationaal Constantin Brunner Institut\\" (ICBI) in the Hague. However, there has been no major revival of interest in his work, despite the efforts of such luminaries as Yehudi Menuhin and Andr√© Breton. Brunner in English Brunner's works available in English include *Science, Spirit, Superstition, which is a compilation of material from his other books. There are extracts from many of Brunner's works, including large sections from Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volk, covering the doctrine and history of science. There are also important sections from Materialismus und Idealismus, a dialogue presentation of Brunner's understanding of philosophy and its history. It includes his writing on a variety of subjects. *Our Christ. A translation, with an introduction and editorial notes. *The Tyranny of Hate: The Roots of Antisemitism, an abridgement of one of Brunner's works on antisemitism. There is relatively abundant secondary literature available in English, notably To live is to think : the thought of twentieth-century German philosopher Constantin Brunner by Hans Goetz (1995). Brunner in French Several works by Brunner are available in French. L'amour is the first part of Brunner's work on sexual relationships. Spinoza contre Kant contains Brunner's sketch of the history of modern philosophy. Le malheur de notre peuple allemand et nos \\" V√∂lkisch \\" (orig. 1924) warns against the dangers of Nazism. The Sorbonne has an archive of several French translations of Brunner's work by Henri Luri√©. There is abundant secondary material in French as well, notably a recent work by Martin Rodan entitled Notre culture europ√©enne, cette inconnue (Peter Lang, 2009).

The son of a powerful bishop, Roger owed his position to his family connections. He lost his office when his father and other relatives lost power. Arrested along with his father, Roger was used to secure the surrender of a castle held by his mother and then disappeared from history. Background and early life Roger was the son of Roger of Salisbury, Lord Chancellor for King Henry I of England and Bishop of Salisbury,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 4: Salisbury: Bishops and Matilda of Ramsbury. It is possible that Roger of Salisbury was married to Matilda prior to his elevation to the episcopate, but this is unlikely. Because their son Roger le Poer was described as \\"young\\" in 1139, it is most likely that he was born after his father's consecration as bishop in 1107. A biographer of Roger of Salisbury, Edward Kealey, has argued that Roger le Poer is the same person as Roger, the archdeacon of Berkshire who died in the 1160s. Another possibility, that the younger Roger was the same as Roger of Ramsbury, archdeacon of Wiltshire, is less likely, as it is known that Roger of Ramsbury was not closely related to Adelelm, the nephew or son of Roger of Salisbury.Kealey Roger of Salisbury pp. 272‚Äì274 The historian Diana Greenway in the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300 takes this view.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 4: Salisbury: Archdeacons: Berkshire] Chancellor The younger Roger's family was a powerful one in EnglandHuscroft Ruling England p. 73 \\\\- not only was his father the Bishop of Salisbury, but he also held the administration of the government in his hands. The older Roger had the powers of the office of justiciar, without having actually been appointed to that office, as a continuation of the power he had held during the second part of the reign of Henry I.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology pp. 70‚Äì71 The elder Roger's two nephews Nigel, who was Bishop of Ely and had previously been Lord Treasurer, and Alexander, who was Bishop of Lincoln - both held important bishoprics, and another nephew or son held the Treasurership from 1136.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 103 This was Adelelm, who may have been a full brother to Roger le Poer. The family also controlled a number of castles throughout England. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the younger Roger's appointment as chancellor was the price demanded by the elder Roger for the bishop's support of Stephen as king after the death of King Henry I.Keats- Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 203 Roger served as chancellor from 1135 until 24 June 1139.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 83 Roger travelled with the king, often accompanying him in the royal progresses around England.Karn \\"Robert de Sigillo\\" English Historical Review p. 11 In late 1136 or 1137, Roger was with the king at a court called at Westminster which heard a complaint by the Holy Trinity Priory in London that Hasculf de Tany, the castellan of the Tower of London, had taken land that belonged to the priory. In the end, the priory regained custody of their land.King King Stephen pp. 68‚Äì69 In March 1137 Roger was with the king right before the king sailed to Normandy, as the chancellor witnessed a charter of the king just prior to his departure.King King Stephen p. 70 and footnote 159 As chancellor, Roger was a witness on over 60 royal writs. Arrest and exile In the middle of 1139, rumours were current that the family was going to defect to Stephen's rival for the throne, the Empress Matilda. These rumours appear to have been started by a group of nobles led by twin brothers Waleran de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan, and Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, with Alan of Brittany. Whether Roger and his family really intended to switch their support to Matilda is unclear, but unlikely.Yoshitake \\"Arrest of the Bishops\\" Journal of Medieval History p. 98 In late June, a fight broke out between some of the retainers of Alan and men in the service of Roger's family. This fight was the excuse for the king moving against Roger's family.Crouch Reign of King Stephen pp. 95‚Äì98 Both the elder and younger Roger were arrested, along with Alexander, but Nigel escaped. Matilda of Ramsbury, who held out in Devizes Castle against the king, was persuaded to surrender the castle to Stephen when the king threatened to hang the younger Roger if she did not yield. The younger Roger was restrained with chains and put on a high platform in view of the castle with a noose around his neck.Kealey Roger of Salisbury pp. 185‚Äì187 The name le poer, or pauperus, means \\"pauper\\" and was not given to Roger until after his and his father's fall from power in 1139. It is possible the new name was bestowed because he could have expected to receive a bishopric after his time as chancellor, which did not happen because of his family's disgrace. Another possible reason for the name was to contrast with his father's wealth. It is unlikely that he was actually poor, as his family was wealthy and powerful. The historian Francis West described the base of the family's power as \\"control of the important offices of royal government\\".West Justiciarship p. 24 Roger was sent into exile after his family's disgrace. If he is the same person as the archdeacon of Berkshire, he died in the middle of the 1160s, but no other sure information is known about him after his exile.

Their innovative approach to heavy- sounding blues, rhythm and blues and rock was a major influence on popular music.  First group  The first Jeff Beck Group formed in London in early 1967 and included guitarist Jeff Beck, vocalist Rod Stewart, and rhythm guitarist Ronnie Wood, with bass players and drummers changing regularly. Early bass players were Jet Harris and Dave Ambrose, with Clem Cattini and Viv Prince trying out on drums. The line-up went through months of personnel changes, notably no fewer than four drummers before settling on Aynsley Dunbar and switching Wood to bass. This line-up spent most of 1967 playing the UK club circuit and appeared several times on BBC Radio. Beck signed a personal management contract with record producer and manager Mickie Most, who had no interest in the group, only in Beck as a solo artist. During 1967 the band released three singles in Europe and two in the United States, the first, \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\", being the most successful, reaching No. 14 on the UK singles chart; it included the instrumental \\"Beck's Bolero\\" as the B side, which had been recorded several months earlier. The line-up for that session included guitarist Jimmy Page on rhythm guitar, John Paul Jones on bass, Keith Moon on drums, and Nicky Hopkins on piano. Frustrated that the band were not playing a strict enough blues set for his taste, drummer Dunbar left and was replaced by Roy Cook for one show, before Stewart recommended Micky Waller, a bandmate of his from Steampacket. Waller went on to play with the band all through 1968 and early 1969, and was their longest-lasting drummer. Peter Grant, a road manager at the time, had been to the US with the New Vaudeville Band, and was aware of the new concert and album-oriented rock FM radio format developing there. It was now possible to break out a band without using the \\"hit single\\" formula. Grant realised that Beck's band was ideal for this market and tried several times to buy Beck's contract from Mickie Most, who refused to let Beck go. By early 1968 the band was ready to throw in the towel, and again to his credit, Grant convinced them not to break up, and booked a short US tour for them. Beck is quoted as saying \\"We were literally down to one change of clothing each\\". Grant's first stop for them was in New York City, for four shows at Fillmore East, where they played second on the bill to the Grateful Dead. They apparently took the town by storm. The New York Times ran the Robert Shelton article: \\"Jeff Beck Group Cheered in Debut\\", with the byline \\"British Pop Singers Delight Fillmore East Audience\\" proclaiming that Beck and his group had upstaged the Grateful Dead. The reviews from The Boston Tea Party were as good or better: \\"By the time he got to his last number... (the fans) were in a state of pandemonium the likes of which hadn't been witnessed since the Beatles hit town.\\" By the time they wrapped up the tour at San Francisco's Fillmore West, Peter Grant had secured them a new album contract with Epic Records. Beck with the Jeff Beck Group, 1968 The band quickly returned to England to record the album Truth, which reached No. 15 in the US charts. The tracks were recorded within two weeks, with overdubs added the following month. Most was busy with other projects at the time and delegated most of the work to Ken Scott, who basically recorded the band playing their live set in the studio. Beck's amplifier was apparently so loud, it was recorded from inside a closet. The extra line-up for these sessions included John Paul Jones on Hammond organ, drummer Keith Moon and Nicky Hopkins on piano. The core group, billed as the \\"Jeff Beck Group\\", returned to the US for a tour to promote the release of Truth. Long-time Beck fan Jimi Hendrix jammed with the band at Cafe Wha during this and their following tours. They embarked on their third tour in December 1968 with Hopkins who, although in poor health, decided he wanted to play live. He accepted Beck's invitation, even though he had been offered more money by Led Zeppelin. Later, he lamented that \\"We lost one of the greatest bands in Rock history.\\" Even with his best intentions, the last leg of the tour was curtailed by illness. Beck then postponed a fourth, February 1969 US tour. This was also because he felt they shouldn't keep playing the same material with nothing new to add to it. New material was written, Waller was replaced by power drummer Tony Newman and Wood was dismissed, only to be re-hired almost immediately. The success of Truth ignited new interest from Most and they recorded an album: Beck-Ola at De Lane Lea Studios, engineered by Martin Birch. They released the single \\"Plynth\\" and laid down three Donovan backing tracks as a favour to Most. Two of them were used for his single \\"Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\\". In May 1969, the Jeff Beck Group embarked on their fourth U.S tour, this time with Hopkins as a full-fledged member. The tour went smoothly, Beck-Ola was received extremely well, reaching No. 15 on the Billboard 200 album chart, but it was reported that there was now terrible in-fighting within the band.Rolling Stone Magazine, \\"Rod: The Autobiography\\" excerpt To illustrate, Rod Stewart's plans to leave the band may have been under consideration by this time; in July 1969, he brought current bandmate Wood and former bandmate Waller into the studio to record his debut full-length solo album, An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down for Mercury Records. The Jeff Beck Group finished the tour and returned to England, only to return to the States in July 1969 for their fifth and final time. It was a short tour, mostly along the East Coast, including Maryland, their final Fillmore East appearance, and the Newport Jazz Festival. Beck broke up the band on the eve of the Woodstock Music Festival, at which they had been scheduled to perform, a decision Beck later stated that he regretted.  Second group  Jeff Beck with Fender Stratocaster Late in 1970, Jeff Beck reformed the Jeff Beck Group with vocalist Alex Ligertwood, keyboardist Max Middleton, drummer Cozy Powell and bassist Clive Chaman. During June 1971, Beck signed a record deal with CBS and was looking for a new singer. After hearing Bobby Tench perform with his band Gass, \\"Upstairs\\" at Ronnie Scott's club in Soho London, Beck employed him as vocalist and second guitarist. Tench was given only a few weeks to write new lyrics and add his vocals to the album Rough and Ready, before mixing resumed on tracks previously recorded in London by Beck and the other band members. The album was finished in July 1971 and they toured Finland, Holland, Switzerland and Germany. Rough and Ready was released in UK on 25 October 1971, with the US release following during February 1972. A sixteen-day promotional tour in the US followed and the album eventually reached No. 46 in the album charts. In January 1972, the band travelled to US to join Beck at TMI studios in Memphis, Tennessee. This is where they recorded the album Jeff Beck Group, using Steve Cropper as producer. Jeff Beck Group was released in UK on 9 June 1972. The promotional tour which followed included an appearance on the BBC Radio 1 \\"In Concert\\" series, which was recorded on 29 June 1972. During this session they played \\"Definitely Maybe\\" which featured Bobby Tench playing guitar, a rare occasion whilst Tench was associated with Beck. On 24 July 1972, the Jeff Beck Group was officially disbanded and Beck's management put out this statement: \\"The fusion of musical styles of the various members has been successful, within the terms of individual musicians, but they didn't feel it had led to the creation of a new musical style with the strength they had originally sought.\\"  Timeline  ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:0 right:20 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1967 till:24/07/1972 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:1 start:1967 Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Piano value:purple legend:Piano/Keyboards id:lines value:black legend:Studio_albums BarData = bar:Rod text:Rod Stewart bar:Alex text:Alex Ligertwood bar:Bobby text:Bobby Tench bar:Jeff text:Jeff Beck bar:Ron text:Ronnie Wood bar:Jet text:Jet Harris bar:Dave text:Dave Ambrose bar:Clive text:Clive Chaman bar:Clem text:Clem Cattini bar:Viv text:Viv Prince bar:Ayn text:Aynsley Dunbar bar:Roy text:Roy Cooke bar:Micky text:Micky Waller bar:Tony text:Tony Newman bar:Cozy text:Cozy Powell bar:Nicky text:Nicky Hopkins bar:Max text:Max Middleton PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Jeff from:start till:15/08/1969 color:guitar bar:Jeff from:01/06/1970 till:end color:guitar bar:Rod from:start till:15/08/1969 color:vocals bar:Ron from:start till:01/08/1967 color:guitar bar:Ron from:01/08/1967 till:15/08/1969 color:bass bar:Jet from:start till:01/04/1967 color:bass bar:Dave from:01/04/1967 till:01/08/1967 color:bass bar:Clem from:start till:01/02/1967 color:drums bar:Viv from:01/02/1967 till:01/04/1967 color:drums bar:Ayn from:01/04/1967 till:01/06/1967 color:drums bar:Roy from:01/06/1967 till:01/08/1967 color:drums bar:Micky from:01/08/1967 till:01/04/1969 color:drums bar:Nicky from:01/01/1968 till:15/08/1969 color:piano bar:Tony from:01/04/1969 till:15/08/1969 color:drums bar:Alex from:01/06/1970 till:31/12/1970 color:vocals bar:Max from:01/06/1970 till:end color:piano bar:Clive from:01/06/1970 till:end color:bass bar:Cozy from:01/06/1970 till:end color:drums bar:Bobby from:01/06/1971 till:end color:vocals bar:Bobby from:01/06/1971 till:end color:guitar width:3 LineData = at:01/08/1968 color:black layer:back at:01/06/1969 color:black layer:back at:25/10/1971 color:black layer:back at:01/05/1972 color:black layer:back  Discography  * Truth (1968) * Beck-Ola (1969) * Rough and Ready (1971) * Jeff Beck Group (1972)  Notes  References  * Bob Brunning (1986) Blues: The British Connection, London: Helter Skelter, 2002, * Bob Brunning (2004) The Fleetwood Mac Story: Rumours and Lies ‚Äì Omnibus Press, foreword by B.B.King *Annette Carson Jeff Beck ‚Äì Crazy Fingers Backbeat Books * Dick Heckstall-Smith (2004) The safest place in the world: A personal history of British Rhythm and blues, Clear Books, ‚Äì First Edition : Blowing The Blues ‚Äì Fifty Years Playing The British Blues * Christopher Hjort (2007) Strange Brew: Eric Clapton and the British blues boom, 1965‚Äì1970, foreword by John Mayall, Jawbone *Chris Hjort and Doug Hinman (2000) Beck's Book: A Chronology of Jeff Beck's Career 1965‚Äì1980: From the Yardbirds to Jazz-Rock, Rock 'n' Roll Research Press. 2000 and * Paul Myers Long John Baldry and the Birth of the British Blues, Vancouver 2007 ‚Äì GreyStone Books * Harry Shapiro Alexis Korner: The Biography, Bloomsbury Publishing, London 1997, Discography by Mark Troster Musical groups established in 1966 English blues rock musical groups Epic Records artists English hard rock musical groups Rod Stewart 1966 establishments in England ","title":"The Jeff Beck Group"},{"id":"625574","text":"CSCE may refer to * Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange which merged to form the New York Board of Trade * Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe * Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which preceded the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe * Canadian Society for Civil Engineering * Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination, used to record results of U.S. amateur radio tests administered by agents of a Volunteer Examiner Coordinator.

Background Wagner composed the Siegfried Idyll as a birthday present to his second wife, Cosima, after the birth of their son Siegfried in 1869. It was first performed on Christmas morning, 25 December 1870,Cosima's actual birthday was 24 December, but she always celebrated it on Christmas Day by a small ensemble of the Tonhalle Orchester Z√ºrich on the stairs of their villa at Tribschen (today part of Lucerne), Switzerland. Cosima awoke to its opening melody. Conductor Hans Richter learned the trumpet in order to play the brief trumpet part, which lasts only 13 measures, in that private performance, reportedly having sailed out to the centre of Lake Lucerne to practise, so as not to be heard. The original title was Triebschen Idyll with Fidi's birdsong and the orange sunrise, as symphonic birthday greeting. Presented to his Cosima by her Richard. \\"Fidi\\" was the family's nickname for their son Siegfried. It is thought that the birdsong and the sunrise refer to incidents of personal significance to the couple. Wagner's opera Siegfried, which was premiered in 1876, incorporates music from the Idyll. Wagner adapted the material from an unfinished chamber piece into the Idyll before giving the theme, to Br√ºnnhilde in the opera's final scene, the \\"Ewig war ich\\" love duet between Br√ºnnhilde and Siegfried. This theme, Wagner claimed, came to him during the summer of 1864 at the Villa Pellet, overlooking Lake Starnberg, where he and Cosima consummated their union. He is contradicted, however, by his own obsessive record keeping: the melody was composed that November 14, when he was alone in Munich. The work also uses a theme based on the German lullaby, \\"Schlaf, Kindlein, schlaf\\", which was jotted down by Wagner on New Year's Eve 1868 and introduced by a solo oboe.ibid. Ernest Newman discovered it was linked to the Wagners' older daughter Eva. This and other musical references, whose meaning remained unknown to the outside world for many years, reveal the idyll's levels of personal significance for both Wagner and Cosima. Wagner originally intended the Siegfried Idyll to remain a private piece. However, due to financial pressures, he decided to sell the score to publisher B. Schott in 1878. In doing so, Wagner expanded the orchestration to 35 players to make the piece more marketable. The original piece is scored for a small chamber orchestra of 13 players: flute, oboe, two clarinets, bassoon, two horns, trumpet, two violins, viola, cello and double bass.

The younger son of a nobleman, Robert was probably a member of the cathedral chapter of York before his selection as chancellor by King Stephen of England in the mid-1140s. He is not mentioned often in documents from his time as chancellor, but why this is so is unknown. He became dean at York Minster around 1147. Robert was slightly involved in the disputes over who would be Archbishop of York in the late 1140s and 1150s, but it is likely that his chancellorship prevented his deeper involvement in diocesan affairs. He was no longer chancellor after the death of Stephen, but probably continued to hold the office of dean until his death around 1157 or 1158. Early life Robert was probably one of the sons of Gilbert de Gant, who is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Gilbert was from Flanders and came to England during 1069.Sherman \\"Robert de Gant\\" Haskins Society Journal pp. 99‚Äì100 Gilbert, who died around 1095, was married to Alice, daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert's conjectured siblings were Emma ‚Äì wife of Alan de Percy,Keats-Rohan Domesday People pp. 210‚Äì211 Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, Gilbert de Gant ‚Äì who died before his father, and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of Gilbert, he was a younger son, probably the youngest of the four brothers, and probably was born sometime around 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there were older siblings. Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter. Robert was probably also the uncle of Gilbert de Gant, later Earl of Lincoln. Robert's first appearance in the historical record is at Ramsey Abbey sometime between 1114 and 1123, where he appears as a witness to a charter. A further appearance is in a document of his brother Walter dating between 1130 and 1139. It is likely that Robert was a canon of York Cathedral before 1147.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Prebends Unidentified He is also claimed to have held the office of Provost of Beverley Minster as the immediate predecessor to Thomas Becket, but this is unlikely, as Becket did not become provost until 1154, long after Robert had become Dean of York.Sherman \\"Robert de Gant\\" Haskins Society Journal pp. 101‚Äì102 Chancellor Robert was Lord Chancellor from spring 1140 to summer 1154, serving King Stephen of England.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology pp. 83‚Äì84Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 160 It is not known exactly when Stephen appointed Robert chancellor nor why Stephen choose him for the office. The historian Richard Sherman speculated that Stephen appointed Robert as a favour to Walter de Gant, perhaps because of Walter's presence at the Battle of Cowton Moor in 1138. Three charters which date from March 1140 to January 1141 and are supposed to be witnessed by Robert all have difficulties with either the dating or whether the signature attributed to Robert is actually Robert, so exact dating of his term of office isn't possible from charter evidence. For a brief period in 1141, Stephen's rival Empress Matilda also appointed two chancellors ‚Äì William de Vere and William fitzGilbert ‚Äì but they did not interrupt Robert's term of service. Robert was with Stephen at Caistor during the middle of 1143, where he was a witness on charters.King King Stephen p. 191 Throughout his approximately 14 years as chancellor, Robert only witnessed 20 charters certainly and perhaps another 13 that are not securely attributed to Robert. Stephen's two previous chancellors, Roger le Poer and Philip de Harcourt, had a much higher rate of attesting charters ‚Äì 62 in 3.5 years for Roger and 12 in 9 months for Philip. Even Baldric, Robert's subordinate and holder of the office of keeper of the royal seal, attested 17 charters during Stephen's reign.Kealey \\"King Stephen\\" Albion p. 208 and footnote18 Various reasons have been put forward for why Robert attested at a lower rate than the earlier chancellors, including indifference to his office, deputising the duties to another clerk, or difficulty in following the itinerant court due to age.Sherman \\"Robert de Gant\\" Haskins Society Journal pp. 102‚Äì103 Robert's last secure appearance as chancellor as a witness to a charter is one dated to the summer of 1154 at Lincoln.Sherman \\"Robert de Gant\\" Haskins Society Journal pp. 104‚Äì105 It is possible that Robert had a falling out with Stephen in the last months of the king's reign ‚Äì Stephen died in October 1154. Stephen besieged Drax Castle in the summer of 1154, which had earlier been given to Robert's nephew Robert. The younger Robert may have objected to giving up his castle to the previous owners and the elder Robert may have taken offence at these events. This would explain why Robert does not appear on Stephen's charters after the Lincoln charter of 1154, but this theory is just speculation by one of Robert's biographers. Robert was replaced as chancellor by Becket shortly after Henry II's coronation on 19 December 1154 and before January 1155. Dean of York Robert held the office of Dean of York from at least 1147, but may have occupied the office as early as 1142. He may have been still alive as late as 1157, as it is possible he was the addressee of a letter from the papacy in January 1157. His last secure attestation as dean is in October 1154.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Deans Although Keats-Rohan states in Domesday Descendants that Robert was also Archdeacon of York,Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 472 he is not so listed in the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae under any of the archdeaconries.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Introduction ArchdeaconsGreenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Archdeacons: YorkGreenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Archdeacons: ClevelandGreenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Archdeacons: East RidingGreenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Archdeacons: NottinghamGreenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 6: York: Archdeacons: Richmond In 1147 William fitzHerbert, the Archbishop of York, was deposed, and a new election for the archbishopric was ordered by Pope Eugenius III on 11 May 1147. The election took place on 24 July 1147 at Richmond rather than York, due to the opposition of William of Aumale, the Earl of York, who supported the ousted archbishop.Sherman \\"Robert de Gant\\" Hastings Society Journal pp. 106‚Äì107 Robert, along with Hugh de Puiset and some of the cathedral chapter, favoured Hilary, a canon lawyer. Most of the rest of the archdiocese's officials and the chapter favoured Henry Murdac. The disputed election was decided by the pope, who declared Murdac the new archbishop and gave the vacant bishopric of Chichester to Hilary.Norton St William pp. 121‚Äì122 Murdac was consecrated by Eugenius on 7 December 1147, and Robert appears to have supported the new archbishop, or at least not to have actively opposed him. But others among the cathedral chapter and suffragan bishops of York continued to actively agitate against Murdac, including refusing him entry to York for three years. Robert took little other part in the disputes at York during Murdac's archiepiscopate. Probably, it was Robert's involvement in secular office as chancellor that restricted his activities with his ecclesiastical office.Norton St William p. 136 Robert may have become a supporter of Murdac's during this time, as the archbishop addressed at least six confirmation grants to Robert. William was re-elected to York after Murdac's death in 1153. When William attempted to enter York on 9 May 1154, Robert, along with Osbert de Bayeux, tried to prevent his entry, but their attempt was unsuccessful and they then went to Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and appealed in vain against William's actions.Norton St William pp. 140‚Äì142 It is possible that Robert feared that William would remove Robert from the deanship. After William's death, Robert, once more acting with Osbert, pressured the cathedral chapter of York to elect Stephen's choice of Roger de Pont L'√âv√™que as the new Archbishop of York.Norton St William p. 139 Osbert was later accused of poisoning William, and was deprived of his office and clerical status when he could not clear himself from the accusation. Although Robert was associated with Osbert's opposition to William, there is no evidence that Robert was ever thought to have been involved in the possible poisoning of William.Sherman \\"Robert de Gant\\" Haskins Society Journal pp. 108‚Äì110 Death The historian Katharine Keats-Rohan records his death as occurring in 1157 or 1158. Robert's successor as dean, Robert Butevilain, is first securely attested as dean on 6 May 1158, and the last secure date for his holding his previous office is 13 December 1157, which suggests that Robert of Ghent died in between those dates, or shortly before the earlier date.

All functions, except for the buying of songs and full length song previews, are available to unregistered users (and full length preview of songs is restricted to individuals who have spent a total of $50 or more on the website). Registration is free. The store maintains an account balance for each user; while a user's account has a positive balance, he or she can continue downloading music. To do so, the user selects the files for download from the store's catalog. =Pricing model= Unlike some US- based music stores such as Apple's iTunes Store, MediaServices' sites charge for the volume of data downloaded, not for individual songs. This price is often reduced by a complicated system of discounts based on cumulative usage, promotions, and type of payment. These discounts can reduce the effective price of downloads by up to one third of the original cost. =Payment methods= The sites operate using a pre-paid balance method. Users fund their account using a credit or debit card, in increments of US$10 or more. However, action taken in late 2006 by Visa and MasterCard\\"Visa halts its service for allofmp3.com\\" CNET, October 18, 2006\\"Blacklisted AllofMP3 slams 'capricious' Visa and Mastercard\\" The Register, October 19, 2006 made it impossible for users to fund their accounts at the main AllOfMP3 site.

ChronoPay had announced on March 20, 2007 that they would no longer be processing payments from online Russian music stores that only hold a ROMS license (e.g. AllOfMP3), but this does not apply to MP3Sparks which has an NP FAIR license.\\"JSC ChronoPay accepts Russian music stores with NP FAIR license only\\" (ChronoPay press release) Between April and June 2007, it had become difficult for users to fund their AllOfMP3 accounts themselves, and a number of users and sites began selling AllOfMP3 gift vouchers on the Internet. However, in May 2007 a man who had been selling vouchers was arrested in London,\\"AllofMP3 voucher operation shut down in Europe\\" Ars Technica, May 21, 2007 and this led many other voucher sellers to shut down their operations. =Download formats= AllOfMP3 (and now MP3Sparks) allows users to choose from a variety of audio codecs for audio files. Lossy formats are offered in constant bitrates up to 320kbit/s or variable bitrates up to maximum quality in the following formats: *MP3 *WMA *Ogg Vorbis *MPEG4-AAC *MPC Select albums are also being made available in Lossless audio codecs in the following formats: *FLAC *PCM *Monkey's Audio *OptimFROG *WMA Lossless Most music is encoded straight from source, which is dubbed Online Encoding Exclusive, so gapless albums could provide gapless playback, unlike most other music services. There is no extra charge for using the Online Encoding Exclusive service. The user sets the codec parameters, including the desired bitrate, allowing for superior quality over other music download services such as iTunes and Napster. Downloaded files do not contain digital rights management information, allowing unrestricted use between multiple computers and digital audio players. This differentiates AllOfMP3 from many other music download services, which limit the use of the music the user may purchase and the platforms on which it may be played. The websites also offer free, full album previews, streamed at a bitrate of 24 kilobits per second (roughly equivalent to analog telephone audio quality). Registered users who have spent less than $50 have access to 90 second samples, and unregistered users have access to 30 second samples.  Music for Masses  In late 2006, AllOfMP3 experimented with a feature called \\"Music for Masses\\" which allowed users to download DRM- protected music for free.\\"Moscow Music Site Defends Free Downloads\\" The New York Times October 18, 2006 The files were encoded in a proprietary MP3 format (.mp3x) that could only be played in the Music for Masses player, and could not be transferred to a portable media device. However, the DRM protection was cracked within a week.\\"MusicForMe cracks AllOfMP3's DRM, hilarity ensues\\" Engadget, October 25, 2006 Although AllOfMP3 released a compulsory update to the player software which rendered the original crack unusable, they eventually removed the service in December 2006. =Download methods= The standard method of downloading purchased music is directly from the services' \\"My Downloads\\" pages. Files can be downloaded from the links on this page using a web browser, or alternatively a download manager or a command-line utility such as wget (the site offers a \\"list of links\\" which can be written to a file and used as input for such tools). Download speeds vary but typically hover around 40-120 kilobytes per second on broadband connections.

Biography The son of Aubrey de Vere II and Adeliza of Clare, probably the fourth of five sons,Barrow \\"Vere, William de\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and brother of Aubrey de Vere III first earl of Oxford, de Vere spent part of his youth at the court of King Henry I of England and his second wife, Queen Adeliza of Leuven. Little is known of his education, but he had received minor ecclesiastical orders before 1141. He was a friend of Bishop Arnulf of Liseux, and may have studied in Paris.Arnulf of Lisieux Letters of Arnulf of Lisieux p. 36, no. 26 William de Vere was promised the chancellorship of England by the Empress Matilda in the 1141 charter by which his brother was made earl, but given the political and military setbacks she suffered in that and subsequent years, it is not surprising that there is no record that he served as her chancellor.Cronne, et al. Regesta Regum Anglo- normannorum no. 634 He later entered the household of Archbishop Theobald of Bec of Canterbury (d. 1163). He served in the archbishop's household with near-contemporaries Thomas Becket and John of Salisbury in the 1150s.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 31 Theobald sent him on diplomatic errands to France in the early 1160s. He is thought to have served briefly as a secular canon of St. Paul's, London, about 1163, but that William de Vere may have been a member of an unrelated Ver family associated with the bishop of London in Domesday Book. William became an Augustinian canon at St Osyth's Priory at Chich, Essex, for from that monastery he was recruited in 1177 by King Henry II to supervise the rebuilding of Waltham Abbey in Essex to house an Augustinian canonry. His name is one of two listed in the Pipe rolls as receiving monies toward that project. King Henry later employed de Vere as an itinerant justice,Saltman Theobald p. 165 footnote 3 then nominated him as Bishop of Hereford on 25 May 1186. He was consecrated on 10 August 1186.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 250 In that office he occasionally continued to serve as a royal justice under Richard I. Bishop William is credited with having extended the east end of Hereford Cathedral, constructing the transitional retrochoir, two transept chapels, and possibly a lady chapel (the latter two areas replaced by his successors). He is also thought to have constructed the bishop's palace at Hereford.Blair \\"Twelfth-century Bishop's Palace\\" Medieval Archaeology p. 59 He expanded the work of his predecessors in the administration of the diocese and employed Gerald of Wales and Robert Grosseteste.Barrow \\"Athelstan to Aigueblanche\\" Hereford Cathedral pp. 42‚Äì43 As a canon at St. Osyth's, de Vere wrote a Latin life of that saint, which now exists only in fragments recorded by antiquarian John Leland in the sixteenth century. In that work he made references to his family. He donated a relic of St. Osyth to Waltham Abbey, and promoted the cult of that saint at Hereford Cathedral. He may have visited Palestine, perhaps in 1178 or in 1182‚Äì1185. De Vere was one of several bishops who excommunicated Prince John and his supporters in 1194, and was present at Winchester Cathedral for the recoronation of King Richard I in April 1194. William de Vere died in December 1198 and is buried in Hereford Cathedral, where his tomb with an effigy can be found.

Synopsis  A bilingual edition of satires, skits and grotesqueries conveying the maddening humdrumness of the ultimate police state.  Summary  \\"The world Berlin author Lutz Rathenow depicts is the colorless, flat, thuddingly dull DDR ‚Äî the German Democratic Republic, as it called itself, or Communist East Germany, as we knew it: a sub-Soviet, sub-standard, bureaucratic parody of a society (1949-1990). And he depicts it very well, only not from the outside, with detailed descriptions, historical costumes and polemical plots, but rather from the inside, dropping in on the mind of one or another of its characters. Here is the little man starved of human contact and longing for romance ('The Girl in Finland'), the timid bureaucrat standing in front of an office door and wondering how to knock ('Mr. Breugel), the writer facing the blank page and fearing both to write and not to write ('The Blank Page'). Here, in other words, is Angst, paralysis, a funnel of doubt and indecision. Out of it comes murderous resentment ('Professor Dr. Mitzenleim'), mocking defiance ('Reasons for Refusing to Make a Statement'), ironic futility ('Meditations on Peace'). People who are emotionally starved, anxious and futile develop a perverse sense of humor ('The Phone Call'); they find grim little pleasures in their living death ('Obituary'). \\"Rathenow's works crystallize not only a past, but also a present and recurring assault on the mind. The government, the political party, the church, the organization, the television program, the newspaper, the company, the office, the boss all want you to think the same way, their way, whatever the country and whatever the time. And if you do, this is what results: reduced capacity, distorted thought, fragmented language, inverted feelings, a sense of unreality, a drabness unto death. The Fantastic Ordinary World of Lutz Rathenow draws this lesson and thus the pleasure out of the painful republic. ~ From the Introduction by Karl Kvitko  Editions  *Translated from the German by Boria Sax & Imogen von Tannenberg, with an Introduction by Boria Sax; illustrations by Robyn Johnson-Ross & Boris Mukhametshin.

He starred in his own television series Cool It (1985‚Äì1990), Cool Head (1991) and Phil Cool (1992), and performed as a touring comedian until his retirement in 2013. Early life Born in Chorley, Lancashire,John Anson, \\"Funnyman Phil Cool to bid farewell to fans on final tour\\", Lancashire Telegraph, 22 February 2013; retrieved 19 May 2013. Cool discovered that he had a skill for pulling faces when he was a 12-year-old at school. Once he left school he worked briefly in a warehouse and as an electrician before turning professional as a comedian and impressionist. Career Whereas many of his impressionist peers concentrated on mimicking the voice of the target and changing in and out of a succession of make-up and costumes, Cool instead placed an emphasis on thrusting his eyebrows, lips and even, seemingly, his ears into the positions required of the part.Phil Cool biography, imdb.com; accessed 26 May 2017. Cool's debut television appearance was in the short-lived comedy show Rock With Laughter, it was round about this time that he made a career-defining performance at Jasper Carrott's Folk Club \\"The Boggery\\". Carrott was impressed with Cool's act and decided to take an active hand in furthering his career. In 1983 he appeared as a regular on the O.T.T. spin-off Saturday Stayback and, in 1984, he became one of the voice artists for the satirical show Spitting Image, impersonating Boy George, Holly Johnson and Mick Jagger for the first two series. It was during his time on Spitting Image that a producer for the BBC spotted him, and got him work on Pebble Mill at One. After the success of these appearances, he was given his own series called Cool It (BBC). The first series of Cool It was repeated within a matter of months. There was a tie-in video release of the best moments of Cool It. The second series aired in 1986 and was also produced by Jasper Carrott. The BBC released another video Cool It Too. Cool recorded an album on Virgin Records called Not Just a Pretty Face, and a book titled Cool's Out. In 1987, he performed at The Secret Policeman's Third Ball. The third and final series was broadcast in 1988. In 1989 he appeared in the mini-film Night of the Comic Dead alongside Frank Carson, Karl Howman and Howard Lew Lewis as part of A Night of Comic Relief 2. His third video, Cool 'N' Hot, was filmed live at the Royal Leamington Spa Centre in 1989. In 1991 he moved to ITV and made a series called Cool Head (Central Television). In the same year Central released a video showcasing some of the best moments of Cool Head. A year later he made another series for Central that was entitled Phil Cool, recorded at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry. This turned out to be Cool's last series for television. In 1992 Cool teamed up with Jasper Carrott and toured the country with their \\"Carrott & Cool\\" show. The \\"Carrott & Cool\\" tour was the subject for one episode of A Day in the Life for Channel 4 in 1993. The episode took a behind-the-scenes look at the show and tour. He had a brief comeback in 1997 when he released his fifth official video, Classic Cool (this has been reissued on DVD), but in August 2000 his career had to be put on hold when he suffered a heart attack, which left him in hospital for eight months. After making a full recovery he returned to the stage with a new show in 2002, and in 2003 he revived his touring partnership with Carrott. He is now a resident in Chipping, Lancashire. In addition to his solo gigs, Cool toured in 2008 with Ken Nicol, performing as Nicol and Cool, providing a blend of music and comedy impressions. Nicol and Cool toured with folk rock group Fairport Convention as a support act for Fairport's 2009 winter tour. They released an album, also called Nicol & Cool. Cool's most recent television and film work has been an appearance on Today with Des and Mel in 2006, being interviewed as part of the BBC's The Story of Light Entertainment and appearing in the movies Upstaged (2005) and The School That Roared (2009). Cool's autobiography, Phil Cool Died Here (And Lived To Tell The Tale), was followed by a book of 'Art Brut'-inspired sketches of children. In 2013 Cool began a farewell nationwide tour, declaring it would be his last because he had \\"just had enough of all the travelling\\". Legacy Writing for the BBC in 2003, author Mark Lewisohn said: \\"Cool was an amazing talent... able to contort his features into a caricature semblance of the intended victim. Sometimes so uncanny was this facial transformation that he didn't need traditional sketch material.\\" In a 2013 interview, comedian and director Stephen Merchant remarked: \\"Cool could genuinely contort his face; he was kind [of] extraordinary as an impressionist because he would actually change his face, without makeup, to look like the people he was doing.

B. Yeats. It is generally considered one of the composer's finest works. It was written between 1920 and 1922 for singer and an unusual accompanying group of flute, cor anglais and string quartet (two violins, viola and cello). Warlock completed the work in Cefn Bryntalch, his family home in Llandyssil, near Montgomery in Wales. There are four songs, with a short instrumental interlude. The poems they are based on (with the first line in parentheses) are: #\\"He Reproves the Curlew\\" (\\"O Curlew, cry no more in the air\\") #\\"The lover mourns for the loss of love\\" (\\"Pale brows, still hands and dim hair\\") #\\"The Withering of the Boughs\\" (\\"I cried when the moon was murmuring to the birds:\\") #Interlude #\\"He Hears the Cry of the Sedge\\" (\\"I wander by the edge of this desolate lake\\") \\"The Withering of the Boughs\\" was taken from In the Seven Woods, while the other poems were taken from The Wind Among the Reeds. There is a lengthy instrumental introduction to the first song, in which the cry of the curlew is represented by the cor anglais and the peewit by the flute. The songs, which concern lost love, are melancholy in mood. A number of motif elements recur throughout the songs dependent on the point in the text ‚Äì a structural technique also found in many others of Warlock's songs.

Its red-varnished, kidney-shaped cap and peripherally inserted stem gives it a distinct fan-like appearance. When fresh, the lingzhi is soft, cork-like, and flat. It lacks gills on its underside, and instead releases its spores via fine pores. Depending on the age, the pores on its underside may be white or brown. The lingzhi mushroom is used in traditional Chinese medicine, but there is insufficient evidence that it is effective for treating any disease. In nature, it grows at the base and stumps of deciduous trees, especially that of the maple. Only two or three out of 10,000 such aged trees will have lingzhi growth, and therefore its wild form is rare. Lingzhi may be cultivated on hardwood logs, sawdust or woodchips.  Taxonomy and ecology  Lingzhi, also known as reishi, is the ancient \\"mushroom of immortality\\", revered for over 2,000 years. Uncertainty exists about which Ganoderma species was most widely utilized as Lingzhi mushroom in ancient times, and likely a few different common species were considered interchangeable. However, in the most famous book of herbal medicine in China, the Bencao Gangmu (1578), a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms were used for different purposes and defined by color. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient Lingzhi for certain, but according to Dai et al. (2017), as well as other researchers and based on molecular work, red reishi is most likely to be Ganoderma lingzhi (Sheng H. Wu, Y. Cao & Y.C. Dai, 2012). This is the species that is most widely found in Chinese herb shops today, and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7-10 other Ganoderma species are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names and are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are based on concentrations of triterpenes such as ganoderic acid and its derivatives which vary widely among species. Research on the genus is on-going, but a number of recent phylogentic analyses have been published in the last number of years. = Nomenclature = Petter Adolf Karsten named the genus Ganoderma in 1881. English botanist William Curtis gave the fungus its first binomial name, Boletus lucidus, in 1781. The lingzhi's botanical names have Greek and Latin roots. Ganoderma derives from the Greek ganos (Œ≥Œ±ŒΩŒøœÇ; \\"brightness\\"), and derma (Œ¥ŒµœÅŒºŒ±; \\"skin; together; shining skin\\"). The specific epithet, lingzhi, comes from Chinese, meaning \\"divine mushroom.\\" With the advent of genome sequencing, the genus Ganoderma has undergone taxonomic reclassification. Prior to genetic analyses of fungi, classification was done according to morphological characteristics such as size and color. The internal transcribed spacer region of the Ganoderma genome is considered to be a standard barcode marker. = Varieties = It was once thought that Ganoderma lingzhi generally occurred in two growth forms: a large, sessile, specimen with a small or nonexistent stalk, found in North America, and a smaller specimen with a long, narrow stalk found mainly in the tropics. However, recent molecular evidence has identified the former, stalkless, form as a distinct species called G. sessile, a name given to North American specimens by William Alfonso Murrill in 1902. Environmental conditions play a substantial role in the lingzhi's manifest morphological characteristics. For example, elevated carbon dioxide levels result in stem elongation in lingzhi. Other formations include antlers without a cap, which may also be related to carbon dioxide levels. The three main factors that influence fruit body development morphology are light, temperature, and humidity. While water and air quality play a role in fruit body development morphology, they do so to a lesser degree. = Habitat = Ganoderma lingzhi is found in Asia growing as a parasite or saprotroph on a variety of treesLoyd AL, Richter BS, Jusino MA, et al.

In the wild, lingzhi grows at the base and stumps of deciduous trees, especially that of the maple. Only two or three out of 10,000 such aged trees will have lingzhi growth, and therefore it is extremely rare in its natural form. Today, lingzhi is effectively cultivated on hardwood logs or sawdust/woodchips. File:Jreishi2.jpgGrown lingzhi Mushroom File:Hokkaido_Reishi's_Deer_Horn_Shape_Reishi.JPGDepending on environmental or cultivation conditions lingzhi may resemble antlers, with no umbrella cap.  History  Man holding ganoderma by Chen Hongshou The word lingzhi (ÈùàËäù) was first recorded in a fu (Ë≥¶; \\"rhapsody; prose-poem\\") by the Han dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (CE 78‚Äì139). His Xijing fu (Ë•ø‰∫¨Ë≥¶) (Western Metropolis Rhapsody) contains a description of the 104 BCE Jianzhang Palace of Emperor Wu of Han that parallels lingzhi with shijun (Áü≥Ëèå; \\"rock mushroom\\"): \\"Raising huge breakers, lifting waves, That drenched the stone mushrooms on the high bank, And soaked the magic fungus on vermeil boughs.\\" The commentary by Xue Zong (d. 237) notes that these fungi were eaten as drugs of immortality. The Shennong bencao jing (Divine Farmer's Classic of Pharmaceutics) of c.200‚Äì250 CE, classifies zhi into six color categories, each of which is believed to benefit the qi, or \\"life force\\", in a different part of the body: qingzhi (ÈùíËäù; \\"Green Mushroom\\") for the liver, chizhi (Ëµ§Ëäù; \\"Red Mushroom\\") for the heart, huangzhi (ÈªÉËäù; \\"Yellow Mushroom\\") for the spleen, baizhi (ÁôΩËäù; \\"White Mushroom\\") for the lungs, heizhi (ÈªëËäù; \\"Black Mushroom\\") for the kidneys, and zizhi (Á¥´Ëäù; \\"Purple Mushroom\\") for the Essence. Commentators identify the red chizhi, or danzhi (‰∏πËäù; \\"cinnabar mushroom\\"), as the lingzhi. Chinese texts have recorded medicinal uses of lingzhi for more than 2,000 years, a few sources erroneously claim its use can be traced back more than 4,000 years. The (1596) Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica) has a Zhi (Ëäù) category that includes six types of zhi (calling the green, red, yellow, white, black, and purple mushrooms of the Shennong bencao jing the liuzhi (ÂÖ≠Ëäù; \\"six mushrooms\\") and sixteen other fungi, mushrooms, and lichens, including mu'er (Êú®ËÄ≥; \\"wood ear\\"; \\"cloud ear fungus\\", Auricularia auricula-judae). The author Li Shizhen classified these six differently colored zhi as xiancao (‰ªôËçâ; \\"immortality herbs\\"), and described the effects of chizhi (\\"red mushroom\\"): {{Quotetext=It positively affects the life-energy, or Qi of the heart, repairing the chest area and benefiting those with a knotted and tight chest. Taken over a long period of time, the agility of the body will not cease, and the years are lengthened to those of the Immortal Fairies. Stuart and Smith's classic study of Chinese herbology describes the zhi. The Bencao Gangmu does not list lingzhi as a variety of zhi, but as an alternate name for the shi'er (Áü≥ËÄ≥; \\"stone ear\\", Umbilicaria esculenta) lichen. According to Stuart and Smith, In Chinese art, the lingzhi symbolizes great health and longevity, as depicted in the imperial Forbidden City and Summer Palace. It was a talisman for luck in the traditional culture of China, and the goddess of healing Guanyin is sometimes depicted holding a lingzhi mushroom.  Regional names = Chinese = The name of the lingzhi fungus has a two thousand-year-old history. The Old Chinese name was first recorded during the Han dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì 9 AD). In the Chinese language, () is a compound. It comprises (); \\"spirit, spiritual; soul; miraculous; sacred; divine; mysterious; efficacious; effective)\\" as, for example, in the name of the Lingyan Temple in Jinan, and (); \\"(traditional) plant of longevity; fungus; seed; branch; mushroom; excrescence\\"). Fabrizio Pregadio notes, \\"The term zhi, which has no equivalent in Western languages, refers to a variety of supermundane substances often described as plants, fungi, or 'excrescences'.\\" Zhi occurs in other Chinese plant names, such as (; \\"sesame\\" or \\"seed\\"), and was anciently used a phonetic loan character for (; \\"Angelica iris\\"). Chinese differentiates Ganoderma species into (; \\"red mushroom\\") G. lingzhi, and (; \\"purple mushroom\\") Ganoderma sinense. Lingzhi has several synonyms. Of these, (; \\"auspicious plant\\") ( ; \\"auspicious; felicitous omen\\" with the suffix ; \\"plant; herb\\") is the oldest; the Erya dictionary (c. 3rd century BCE) defines , interpreted as a miscopy of (; \\"mushroom\\") as (; \\"mushroom\\"), and the commentary of Guo Pu (276‚Äì324) says, \\"The [zhi] flowers three times in one year. It is a [ruicao] felicitous plant.\\" Other Chinese names for Ganoderma include (; \\"auspicious mushroom\\"), (; \\"divine mushroom\\", with shen; \\"spirit; god' supernatural; divine\\"), () (with \\"tree; wood\\"), (; \\"immortality plant\\", with xian; \\"(Daoism) transcendent; immortal; wizard\\"), and () or (; \\"mushroom plant\\"). Since both Chinese ling and zhi have multiple meanings, lingzhi has diverse English translations. Renditions include \\"[zhi] possessed of soul power\\", \\"Herb of Spiritual Potency\\" or \\"Mushroom of Immortality\\", \\"Numinous Mushroom\\", \\"divine mushroom\\", \\"divine fungus\\", \\"Magic Fungus\\", and \\"Marvelous Fungus\\". = English = In English, lingzhi or ling chih (sometimes spelled \\"ling chi\\", using the French EFEO Chinese transcription) is a Chinese loanword. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) gives the definition, \\"The fungus Ganoderma lucidum (actually Ganoderma lingzhi, see Ganoderma lucidum for details], believed in China to confer longevity and used as a symbol of this on Chinese ceramic ware.\\", and identifies the etymology of the word as Chinese: l√≠ng, \\"divine\\" + zhƒ´, \\"fungus\\". According to the OED, the earliest recorded usage of the Wade‚ÄìGiles romanization ling chih is 1904, (Victoria and Albert Museum); This context describes the lingzhi fungus and ruyi scepter as Daoist symbols of longevity on a jade vase. and of the Pinyin lingzhi is 1980. In addition to the transliterated loanword, English names include \\"glossy ganoderma\\" and \\"shiny polyporus\\". = Japanese = The Japanese word () is a Sino-Japanese loanword deriving from the Chinese (; ). Its modern Japanese kanji, , is the shinjitai (\\"new character form\\") of the ky≈´jitai (\\"old character form\\"), . Synonyms for reishi are divided between Sino-Japanese borrowings and native Japanese coinages. Sinitic loanwords include literary terms such as (, from ; \\"auspicious plant\\") and (, from ; \\"immortality plant\\"). The Japanese writing system uses or () for \\"grass; lawn; turf\\", and take or () for \\"mushroom\\" (e.g., shiitake). A common native Japanese name is (; \\"10,000-year mushroom\\"). Other Japanese terms for reishi include (; \\"departure mushroom\\"), (; \\"sage mushroom\\"), and (; \\"grandchild ladle\\"). = Korean = The Korean name, (; ) is also borrowed from, so a cognate with, the Chinese word (; ). It is often called yeongjibeoseot (; \\"yeongji mushroom\\") in Korean, with the addition of the native word () meaning \\"mushroom\\". Other common names include (, ; \\"elixir grass\\") and (; ). According to color, yeongji mushrooms can be classified as (; ) for \\"red\\", (; ) for \\"purple\\", (; ) for \\"black\\", (; ) for \\"blue\\" or \\"green\\", (; ) for \\"white\\", and (; ) for \\"yellow\\". = Thai = The Thai word () is a compound of the native word () meaning \\"mushroom\\" and the loanword () from the Chinese (; ). = Vietnamese = The Vietnamese language word is a loanword from Chinese. It is often used with , the Vietnamese word for \\"mushroom\\", thus is the equivalent of \\"lingzhi mushroom\\".  Use = Phytochemistry and research = Ganoderic acid A, a compound isolated from lingzhi Ganoderma lucidum contains diverse phytochemicals, including triterpenes (ganoderic acids), which have a molecular structure similar to that of steroid hormones. It also contains phytochemicals found in fungal materials, including polysaccharides (such as beta-glucan), coumarin, mannitol, and alkaloids. Sterols isolated from the mushroom include ganoderol, ganoderenic acid, ganoderiol, ganodermanontriol, lucidadiol, and ganodermadiol. A 2015 Cochrane database review found insufficient evidence to justify the use of G. lucidum as a first-line cancer treatment. It stated that G. lucidum may have \\"benefit as an alternative adjunct to conventional treatment in consideration of its potential of enhancing tumour response and stimulating host immunity.\\" Existing studies do not support the use of G. lucidum for treatment of risk factors of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ganoderma lucidum extract has a counteracting effect on ageing and significantly prolongs the lifespan of the laboratory nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Ganoderma lucidum extract administered to laboratory mice has modulated the immune system of these animals, improving the phagocytic function of macrophages and the activity of natural killer cells. = Medicinal = Coffee with Lingzhi Extract Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is traditionally prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) is added to boiling water which is then reduced to a simmer, covered, and left for 2 hours. The resulting liquid is dark and fairly bitter in taste. The red lingzhi is often more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated to increase the concentration. Alternatively, it can be used as an ingredient in a formula decoction, or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). Lingzhi is now commercially manufactured and sold. Since the early 1970s, most lingzhi is cultivated. Lingzhi can grow on substrates such as sawdust, grain, and wood logs.

The language was designed by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie for the original versions of UNIX. It is an extension of an earlier macro processor m3, written by Ritchie for an unknown AP-3 minicomputer.Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. The m4 macro processor. Technical report, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA, 1977. pdf The macro preprocessor operates as a text-replacement tool. It is employed to re-use text templates, typically in computer programming applications, but also in text editing and text-processing applications. Most users require m4 as a dependency of GNU autoconf. History Macro processors became popular when programmers commonly used assembly language. In those early days of programming, programmers noted that much of their programs consisted of repeated text, and they invented simple means for reusing this text. Programmers soon discovered the advantages not only of reusing entire blocks of text, but also of substituting different values for similar parameters. This defined the usage range of macro processors. In 1960s, an early general-purpose macro processor M6 was in use at AT&T; Bell Laboratories, which was developed by Douglas McIlroy, Robert Morris and Andrew Hall. Kernighan and Ritchie developed m4 in 1977, basing it on the ideas of Christopher Strachey. The distinguishing features of this style of macro preprocessing included: * free-form syntax (not line-based like a typical macro preprocessor designed for assembly-language processing) * the high degree of re-expansion (a macro's arguments get expanded twice: once during scanning and once at interpretation time) The implementation of Rational Fortran used m4 as its macro engine from the beginning; and most Unix variants ship with it. many applications continue to use m4 as part of the GNU Project's autoconf. It also appears in the configuration process of sendmail (a widespread mail transfer agent) and for generating footprints in the gEDA toolsuite. The SELinux Reference Policy relies heavily on the m4 macro processor. m4 has many uses in code generation, but (as with any macro processor) problems can be hard to debug.Kenneth J. Turner. Exploiting the m4 macro language. Technical Report CSM-126, Department of Computing Science and Mathematics, University of Stirling, Scotland, September 1994. pdf Features m4 offers these facilities: * a free-form syntax, rather than line based syntax * a high degree of macro expansion (arguments get expanded during scan and again during interpretation) * text replacement * parameter substitution * file inclusion * string manipulation * conditional evaluation * arithmetic expressions * system interface * programmer diagnostics * programming language independent * human language independent * provides programming language capabilities Unlike most earlier macro processors, m4 does not target any particular computer or human language; historically, however, its development originated for supporting the Ratfor dialect of Fortran. Unlike some other macro processors, m4 is Turing-complete as well as a practical programming language. Unquoted identifiers which match defined macros are replaced with their definitions. Placing identifiers in quotes suppresses expansion until possibly later, such as when a quoted string is expanded as part of macro replacement. Unlike most languages, strings in m4 are quoted using the backtick (\`) as the starting delimiter, and apostrophe (') as the ending delimiter. Separate starting and ending delimiters allows the arbitrary nesting of quotation marks in strings to be used, allowing a fine degree of control of how and when macro expansion takes place in different parts of a string. Example The following fragment gives a simple example that could form part of a library for generating HTML code. It defines a commented macro to number sections automatically: divert(-1) m4 has multiple output queues that can be manipulated with the \`divert' macro. Valid queues range from 0 to 10, inclusive, with the default queue being 0. As an extension, GNU m4 supports more diversions, limited only by integer type size. Calling the \`divert' macro with an invalid queue causes text to be discarded until another call. Note that even while output is being discarded, quotes around \`divert' and other macros are needed to prevent expansion. # Macros aren't expanded within comments, meaning that keywords such # as divert and other built-ins may be used without consequence. # HTML utility macro: define(\`H2_COUNT', 0) # The H2_COUNT macro is redefined every time the H2 macro is used: define(\`H2', \`define(\`H2_COUNT', incr(H2_COUNT)) ## H2_COUNT. $1 ') divert(1)dnl dnl dnl The dnl macro causes m4 to discard the rest of the line, thus dnl preventing unwanted blank lines from appearing in the output. dnl H2(First Section) H2(Second Section) H2(Conclusion) dnl divert(0)dnl dnl undivert(1)dnl One of the queues is being pushed to output. Processing this code with m4 generates the following text: ## 1\\\\. First Section ## 2\\\\. Second Section ## 3\\\\. Conclusion Implementations FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD provide independent implementations of the m4 language. Furthermore, the Heirloom Project Development Tools includes a free version of the m4 language, derived from OpenSolaris. M4 has been included in the Inferno operating system. This implementation is more closely related to the original m4 developed by Kernighan and Ritchie in Version 7 Unix than its more sophisticated relatives in UNIX System V and POSIX.

The appellation also refers to that prophet which will induce mankind to turn back to God. Islam The phrase Khatamu ‚Äôn-Nabiyyƒ´n (\\"Seal of the Prophets\\") is a title used in the Quran to designate the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It is generally regarded to mean that Muhammad is the last of the prophets sent by God. =Ahmadiyya movement= The Ahmadiyya movement was founded in India in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who claimed to be the promised Messiah (\\"Second Coming of Christ\\"), the Mahdi awaited by the Muslims and a \\"subordinate\\" prophet to Muhammad whose job was to restore the original Sharia given to Muhammad by guiding or rallying disenchanted Ummah back to Islam and thwart attacks on Islam by its opponents. The followers are divided into two groups, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam, the former believing that Ghulam Ahmad was a non-law bearing prophet and the latter believing that he was only a religious reformer though a prophet in an allegorical sense. Ahmadis consider themselves Muslims and claim to practice the pristine form of Islam as re- established with the teachings of Ghulam Ahmad. In many Islamic countries, however, the Ahmadis have been defined as heretics and non-Muslim and subjected to persecution and often systematic oppression. Christianity Most Christian churches deny that there was or will be a definite last prophet, although the cessationist perspective is held by much of Protestantism. Others, called \\"continuationists\\", hold that prophecy continues, and a debate continues. The Eastern Orthodox Church holds that Malachi was the \\"Seal of Prophets\\" - meaning that he was the last prophet before the coming of Jesus Christ The Iglesia ni Cristo, an independent, nontrinitarian Christian religion based in the Philippines, professes that founder Felix Manalo was the last messenger sent by God to reestablish the original church founded by Jesus. Others In Hinduism, the history of mankind is described in four religious (dharmic) ages (yugas), which depict a gradual decline in religious activities, only to be renewed at the end to start a new cycle of the four ages. At the end of Kali Yuga, the current and last age in a cycle, Kalki, the 10th avatar of Vishnu, is prophesied to appear to punish the wicked, reward the good, and inaugurate Satya Yuga of the next cycle. Kalki is the last avatar in the current cycle. Other religious traditions have used this or similar terms. Mani, founder of the Persian faith Manichaeism, also claimed to be the Seal of the Prophets and the last prophet. Judaism considers Malachi to be the last of the biblical prophets, but believes that the Messiah will be a prophet and that there will possibly be other prophets alongside him. In Mandaeanism, John the Baptist is considered the last prophet.

The company started in the 1950s, producing confectionery, evolved into Donruss and started producing trading cards. During the 1960s and 1970s Donruss produced entertainment-themed cards. Its first sports theme cards were produced in 1965, when it created a series of racing cards sponsored by Hot Rod Magazine. Its next series of sports products came in 1981, when it produced baseball and golf trading cards. It was one of three manufacturers to produce baseball cards from 1981 through 1985, along with Fleer and Topps. In 1986, Sportflics (Major League Marketing) entered the market as the fourth fully licensed card producer, followed by Score in 1988, and Upper Deck in 1989. Since entering the trading card market, it has produced a variety of sports trading cards, including American football, baseball, basketball, boxing, golf, ice hockey, racing and tennis; and has acquired a number of brand names. In 1996 Donruss was acquired by rival Pinnacle Brands, makers of Score and Sportflix. Donruss produced baseball cards from 1981 to 1998, when then-parent company Pinnacle Brands filed for bankruptcy. Baseball card production resumed in 2001, when then- parent company Playoff Corporation acquired the rights to produce baseball cards. From 2007 to 2009, Donruss released baseball card products featuring players that were no longer under MLB contract after MLB decided to limit licensing options in 2005. Company history=1954 to 1998, Donruss= Douglas Thomas, Donald, and Russel Wiener founded the original Donruss company in 1954. At first, they were the owners of the Thomas Wiener Company located in Memphis, Tennessee. They manufactured hard candy, suckers and Super Bubble gum. Combining their first names, Douglas, Don, and Russ, they renamed their company Donruss and continued to produce candy and gum. Donruss produced several entertainment-themed trading cards, from such television shows as The Addams Family, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, The Monkees and The Flying Nun from 1961 until 1969. That same year, Donruss made national news with a $30,000 surtax dispute. Donruss paid its surtax but sued to get the money back. It won in U.S. Circuit Court but lost in U.S. Supreme Court. Donruss claimed its earnings did not pass the \\"purpose test\\" to avoid paying the taxes, and having lost it prevented any other corporation from using the purpose test. Later that year, Donruss was purchased by General Mills. Donruss continued making entertainment-themed cards throughout the 1970s, adding titles like The Dukes of Hazzard, Elvis Presley, Kiss and Saturday Night Fever to its product lines. Producing these cards was profitable; however, Donruss, looking for additional avenues of income, desired to enter the baseball card market. Unfortunately, Topps had exclusive rights and Donruss would have to wait until Fleer's lawsuit against Topps. In 1975, Fleer sued Topps over its exclusive baseball rights. After five years a federal judge ruled that Topps illegally obtained Major League Baseball Players Association rights. Donruss and Fleer negotiated deals with Major League Baseball and by late 1980 Donruss had acquired the rights to produce baseball cards. Its first baseball card set was produced and ready in time for the 1981 season. In August of that year, an appellate court overturned the judge's ruling. Quick to react, Fleer's lawyers found a loophole in Topps' contract that stated it had exclusive rights to sell baseball cards with gum or candy. So, Fleer started distributing its baseball cards with stickers, and Donruss started distributing its cards with puzzle pieces. Overproduction and distribution was an early problem for Donruss. In 1983 Huhtam√§ki Oyj purchased Beatrice US Confections, Donruss and Leaf Candy Company, merging the three companies into \\"Leaf, Inc.\\" The company continued to use the \\"Donruss\\" name on baseball cards, which now benefited from Leaf's established distribution network. The Leaf brand was used from 1985 through 1988 on specially made baseball cards distributed in Canada, and in 1990 on a premium series of cards distributed in the U.S. Donruss expanded its Memphis plant from to nearly 400,000, grew from 550 employees to 720 and continued to make trading cards and bubble gum at the facility throughout 1991. In 1992 demand for higher-quality cards rose, and standard card sales dropped. Donruss responded by reducing production, increasing price, upgrading card quality and randomly inserted limited edition and autographed insert cards to its new foil packaged cards. Donruss also partnered with Coca-Cola, Cracker Jack and McDonald's to create special card series, and created a less expensive line of cards called \\"Triple Play\\" targeted at young collectors. In 1993 Donruss acquired the rights to produce hockey cards. With poor sales in 1994, due in part to a Major League Baseball strike and National Hockey League lockout, Donruss began producing new lines of entertainment cards, and a football collectible card game under license from NXT Games, in 1995. In 1996, Pinnacle Brands acquired the Donruss/Leaff brands, as well as their baseball and hockey licenses, from Huhtam√§ki Oyj for about $41 million.Pinnacle Brands to Acquire Donruss Trading Cards on AP News, 18 Apr 1996 The entertainment line was sold to United States Playing Card Company. Pinnacle used the Donruss and Leaf brands on baseball, football and hockey cards. In July 1998 Pinnacle Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. =1970 to 2001, Playoff Corp.= Playoff Corp. can be traced back to as early as 1970 with a company called Optigraphics. At the time, Optigraphics specialized in advanced printing technology. Its first sports work was seen in 1983 when 7-Eleven began distributing multiple-image discs utilizing the lenticular printing process which gave an appearance as though the image were moving, or changing ‚Äìwith purchases of Slurpee drinks. In 1985 the company obtained baseball licenses and started producing its unique style of cards under the name \\"Sportflics\\". This also marked the first time any company used full-color photography on the back of sports cards. Minus \\"Magic Motion\\", but using the same style as its Sportflics cards, it released baseball cards under the Score brand in 1988 and football cards under the Score brand in 1989. In 1992 founders and owners Ann Blake and John Flavin divorced. Flavin maintained the Score brand. Blake left and founded a new company called Cardz Distribution, which later developed into Playoff Corp. and ultimately gained control of the Score brand, along with Donruss and Leaf, in 1998 when then parent company Pinnacle Brands, Inc. was under bankruptcy. Playoff could not obtain Pinnacle/Donruss' baseball and hockey licenses, however. Playoff was producing high-end lines of football cards, generating some $25 million in annual revenues. With its Pinnacle Brands purchase, Playoff began producing trading cards under the Donruss Elite, Leaf and Score brand names. Playoff expanded its business in 2000 by adding a distribution facility, and developed its Score Entertainment subsidiary to produce Dragonball Z trading cards. =1988 to 1997, Action Packed= Action Packed manufactured trading cards from 1988 to 1997. Complete sets consisted of few cards to keep collectors happy when opening packages. Action Packed created a 6-card embossed set in 1988 to show its technique to Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association. It was not awarded a license. Action packed created a single set of basketball cards in 1995, produced football cards from 1990 to 1997, produced hockey cards in 1993 and 1995, produced racing cards in 1990 and from 1992 to 1997, and World Wrestling Federation cards in 1994 and 1995. Pinnacle Brands acquired the brand in 1995. =2001 to 2009, Donruss Playoff L.P.= In 2001 Playoff Corp. became Donruss Playoff L.P., acquired the rights to produce baseball cards and established its headquarters in Arlington, Texas. Donruss Playoff expanded its entertainment lines in 2002, with such trading cards as Buffy, The Vampire Slayer through its new Score Entertainment division. Donruss also produced the first Spanish-only baseball card set. In 2003, Donruss Playoff stirred up controversy when it paid $264,210 at auction for a rare game-worn Babe Ruth jersey, which it then cut up and turned into 2,100 memorabilia cards. In 2004, Donruss Playoff acquired the rights to Pacific Trading Cards Inc., a Lynnwood, Washington‚Äîbased company, that had a major impact on sports cards in the mid-1990s and early 2000s.http://collectibles.about.com/od/manufacturersreleases/a/blPRdonr100504.htm From 2007 to 2009, Donruss has released baseball card products featuring players that are no longer under MLB contract. =2009 and beyond= On March 13, 2009, Panini s.p.a. of Italy (which had previously acquired the exclusive license to produce NBA trading cards beginning with the 2009‚Äì10 season), announced that it had purchased Donruss Playoff. Effective immediately, the company was renamed Panini America, Inc. However, the company continued to operate out of Irving, Texas, with much of the existing upper management. During the 2010 Industry Summit Collectibles (a gathering where retailers can meet leaders in the trading cards industry, and listen to discussions about card collecting), held in Las Vegas on April 11, Panini America announced changes to the company's distribution network. Vice president Mike Anderson and sales director Rodney Alsup outlined their goals to address retail store concerns over profit margins, and how online sellers are having a negative impact. Only retail stores would be authorized to sell Panini products directly to consumers, and any retailer attempting to wholesale would lose its authorization. Only wholesalers would be authorized to sell Panini products directly to retailers, and any wholesaler attempting to retail would lose its authorization. ‚ÄúYou are one, or you are the other,‚Äù Anderson said. Alsup noted they would reduce the current number of wholesalers from fifty to about four nationally. Under Donruss Playoff the company sold to anyone. ‚ÄúWe turned a blind eye toward those things, because, honestly, we had to. Our ownership needed the money, and we perpetuated the industry‚Äôs problem,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúBut under Panini ownership, we work for a CEO who is allowing us to do what should‚Äôve been done 10 years ago. We are well structured, well financed and committed to doing what is best for the brick-and-mortar stores who are the lifeblood of this hobby.‚Äù Panini also outlined other initiatives: will continue to destroy returned NBA trading cards to protect \\"collectibility\\", willing to implement minimum advertised price if needed, formation of a brick- and-mortar standards committee, upgraded ordering systems and schedules, new football and hockey trading cards and other products featuring autographs and memorabilia swatches from sports, history and pop culture. Baseball cards=1981 to 1989= Logo from 1980 to 1985. It was revived for the 2002 retro- themed Donruss Originals set. In the winter of 1980, on the heels of Fleer's historic court victory over Topps, Donruss rushed into production a 605-card set for the 1981 season. The first printings were riddled with errors (though Fleer's first set was even worse in this regard), most of which were fixed in subsequent runs. They were also printed on flimsy card stock and there were no factory sets; rather, the cards were shipped to dealers in 100-count lots and were then collated by hand. TCMA of Amawalk, New York handled dealer business. TV personality Keith Olbermann was a photographer for some of the cards that were part of the 1981 Donruss set.http://petapixel.com/2016/01/25/keith- olbermann-was-the-photographer-behind-bad-photos-on-1981-baseball-cards/ With an entire offseason to prepare, Donruss shipped a much improved, more polished set for 1982. The 1982 offering also saw the introduction of the Diamond Kings, the first 26 cards of the 660-card set, made up of oil paintings by noted sports artist Dick Perez. Another Donruss innovation for 1982 was the inclusion of jigsaw puzzle pieces with a pack of cards in place of gum. Babe Ruth was pictured as \\"Hall of Fame Diamond King\\" when the 63-piece puzzle was assembled. (An appeal of the 1978 Fleer v. Topps ruling in 1981 barred the two new card companies from using gum premiums; Fleer switched to team logo stickers in 1982). Donruss also began selling to dealers directly, the first of the major card companies to offer factory sets for those buying in bulk. Notable card in this set is Cal Ripken's rookie card. Donruss released three baseball card sets in 1983. Its standard 660-card set (with only minimal changes; a glove replacing the ball on the front and the back switching from blue to yellow), a 60-card \\"Action All-Star\\" set and a 44-card \\"Hall of Fame Heroes\\" set. \\"Action All-Star\\" were not the standard 2¬Ω\\" by 3¬Ω\\" card size, rather 3¬Ω\\" by 5\\" and included a 63-piece Mickey Mantle puzzle (eight cards per pack and three pieces on one card per pack). The \\"Hall of Fame Heroes\\" set were standard sized cards issued in the same packs as the \\"Action All-Star\\" cards, but rather than picturing photographs of the players Donruss used its Diamond King style and showed Dick Perez oil paintings. Notable rookie cards in their standard set include Ryne Sandberg, Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs. Another card of note is an error card of Ron Jackson where Donruss claimed he played for the A's rather than the Angels. Donruss did issue a card to correct the error. This year's jigsaw puzzle inserted in wax packs featured Ty Cobb. The 1984 660-card base set was among the company's most successful; however, only 658 are numbered. A new feature introduced this year were two \\"Living Legend\\" cards designated A (featuring Gaylord Perry and Rollie Fingers) and B (featuring Johnny Bench and Carl Yastrzemski). These were issued as bonus cards in wax packs but not issued in the factory set. Another new feature among the base set were labeling cards 27 through 46 as Rated Rookies (chosen by Bill Madden). This year's jigsaw puzzle inserted in wax packs is Duke Snider. Notable card in this set is Don Mattingly's rookie card. Donruss, again, produced the 60-card \\"Action All-Star\\" set, with this year's 63-piece puzzle featuring Ted Williams, and created another 3¬Ω\\" by 5\\" 60-card set called \\"Champions\\". The \\"Champions\\" featured the artwork of Dick Perez and were issued in cello packs along with pieces of the Duke Snider puzzle. Donruss released six baseball card sets in 1985. The standard 660-card set, 60-card \\"Action All-Stars\\", 56-card \\"Highlights\\", 8-card \\"Hall of Fame Sluggers\\", 28-card \\"Super Diamond Kings\\" and 263-card \\"Leaf\\" set. The standard set contained last year's features, the first 26 cards are Diamond Kings with artwork by Perez-Steele Galleries and cards 27 through 46 as Rated Rookies. Lou Gehrig puzzle pieces were inserted in this year's wax packs. Notable card in this set is Roger Clemens' rookie card. The wax boxes, which held the wax packs, of the standard issue set featured four standard-size cards, styled the same as the standard set, on the bottom of the box and are numbered with a PC prefix. \\"Action All-Stars\\" measured the usual 3¬Ω\\" by 5\\", but rather than using a different puzzle for this set Donruss issued the standard set's Lou Gehrig puzzle pieces with the cards. The \\"Highlights\\" set, as the name would suggest, features 54 highlights of players and pitchers of the month for the American League and National League. The final two cards of the set were devoted to American League and National League Rookies of the Year (chosen by Donruss). Dick Perez provided the artwork for the 3¬Ω\\" by 6¬Ω\\" \\"Hall of Fame Sluggers\\" set. Players for this set were chosen by their career slugging percentage, and the cards are numbered by the percentages. This is the first and last time Donruss would make this type of set. The \\"Super Diamond Kings\\" are enlarged, measuring approximately 4 15/16 by 6¬æ\\", versions of the first 26 cards of the standard set, and were obtained through mail-order. The other two cards featured a checklist card and one of artist Dick Perez. A Lou Gehrig puzzle piece was also included in the mail-order. Donruss produced a \\"Leaf\\" set to establish themselves in the Canadian baseball card market along with rival Topps' affiliate O-Pee-Chee. These cards are similar in appearance to the standard set, but are numbered differently and the backs are in both French and English. Card numbers 251 and 252 feature Dick Perez artwork of Dave Stieb and Tim Raines, respectively, and are not found in the standard set. Wax packs of this set also contained Lou Gehrig puzzle pieces. Donruss released this set at a later date in the U.S. Arguably Donruss' most-recognizable logo, used from 1986 to 1995 Donruss' 1986 baseball card sets didn't deviate much from 1985. The standard 660-card set featured Hank Aaron puzzle pieces inserted into wax packs. Again, Donruss issued cards on the bottom of wax boxes. The 60-card \\"Action All-Stars\\" changed slightly. The set was now called \\"All- Stars\\" and featured players that were involved in the 1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Cards were very similar to the standard set, and backs of the cards displayed each players All-Star game statistics. Similar to the 1985 and 1986 wax boxes, the All-Star Boxes featured four standard-size cards, styled the same as the standard set, on the bottom of the box. The 56-card \\"Highlights\\" set were given a glossy-coating on the front side of the card. Again, the \\"Super Diamond Kings\\" set was available by mail-order and is an enlarged versions of the regular set. This year's set featured an extra card, however. Card 27 is Pete Rose \\"King of Kings\\". The other two cards featured a no numbered checklist card and a no numbered card depicting the complete Hank Aaron jigsaw puzzle. The 264-card \\"Leaf\\" set had the same differences as the previous year's set. However, this year card numbers 214 and 254 feature Dick Perez artwork of Jeff Reardon and Jesse Barfield, respectively, and are not found in the standard set. Two new sets were introduced in 1986. 18-card \\"Pop- Ups\\" and 56-card \\"Rookies\\". The \\"Pop-Ups\\" measured 2¬Ω\\" by 5\\" and features the first 18 players of the \\"All-Star\\" set. The cards were die-cut and folded in a manner that when we unfolded, or \\"popped up\\", could stand on its own and give the appearance of a player in action in front of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome ballpark background. For the cards to remain in mint condition, card collecting guides recommend not unfolding the cards. The \\"Rookies\\" were issued in factory set form and came with 15-piece jigsaw puzzle of Hank Aaron. All of the 1986 sets were used again in 1987, with a few differences. The standard set put a checklist card at #27, so the Rated Rookie cards now occupied 28 through 47. Roberto Clemente debuted as the jigsaw puzzle pieces inserted into wax packs, and the 1987 factory sets contained a complete puzzle set. Perez- Steele Galleries started using repeats of the Diamond King (1-26) sections, to avoid depleting their limited pool of available players. There was no change to the \\"All-Stars\\" set. 1987 marked the last year Donruss issued cards on the bottom of the regular set and \\"All-Stars\\" boxes, and the last year Donruss released a \\"Highlights\\" set. \\"Pop-Ups\\" increased from an 18-card to 20-card set. \\"Rookies\\" replaced last year's 15-piece jigsaw puzzle with Roberto Clemente. \\"Super Diamond Kings\\" decreased from a 29-card set to a 28-card set, excluding card 27 this time. Again, the other two cards featured a no numbered checklist card and a no numbered card depicting the complete Roberto Clemente jigsaw puzzle. This year's \\"Leaf\\" set featured artwork by Dick Perez on card numbers 65 and 173, Floyd Youmans and Mark Eichhorn, respectively. Again, those cards were not in the U.S. set. 1987 was the last year Donruss released enlarged versions of the \\"All-Stars\\" and \\"Pop-Ups\\" sets. Donruss introduced one new 272-card set this year called \\"Opening Day\\". The set featured a card for every player in the starting line up on Opening Day. Like the \\"Rookies\\" set, the \\"Opening Day\\" set contained a 15-piece jigsaw puzzle of Roberto Clemente. Notable card in this set is a Barry Bonds' error card with Johnny Ray pictured instead of Bonds. Donruss did issue a card to correct the error. 1987 was the only year Donruss issued an \\"Opening Day\\" set. In 1988 Donruss started distributing a new set within its standard 660-card set. In addition to finding the usual jigsaw puzzle piece, this year's being Stan Musial, bonus cards, numbered with a BC prefix, were randomly inserted into wax packs. These cards had an MVP logo on the face of the card to distinguish them from the regular set; and created a new 26-card \\"Bonus MVP\\" set, featuring the most valuable player from each Major League Baseball team. This did, however, create a problem for both sets. Rather than producing extra packaging materials to ship the extra cards, Donruss pulled cards from both sets to make room. This meant 26 cards from the regular set were in shorter print, cards 648 through 660 more so than the other thirteen; and cards BC14 through BC26 were in shorter print from the \\"Bonus MVP\\" set. The short printed cards did not have a significant effect on the cards values. Also new to 1988 is a 336-card set called \\"Baseball's Best\\" and 27-card \\"Team Books\\" of the A's, Cubs, Mets, Red Sox and Yankees. \\"Baseball's Best\\" was issued late in the season and sold in big-box stores as a complete factory set. Six 15-piece jigsaw puzzles of Stan Musial are included in every factory set. Each \\"Team Book\\" was issued with 27-cards (3 pages with 9 cards) and a large, perforated full-page puzzle of Stan Musial. These cards are identical to the standard set cards, but copyrighted 1988 rather than 1987, distinguishing the cards from the regular set. Donruss did not issue \\"Team Books\\" again. Donruss produced their \\"All-Stars\\", \\"Pop-Ups\\", \\"Rookies\\", \\"Super Diamond Kings\\" and \\"Leaf\\" sets again in 1988 with a few differences. Previous years \\"All-Stars\\" and \\"Pop-Ups\\" enlarged sets were now produced in the standard 2¬Ω\\" by 3¬Ω\\" card size. \\"All- Stars\\" increased from a 60-card set to a 64-card set. No other changes to the \\"Pop-Ups\\" set. The \\"Rookies\\" set replaced this year's 15-piece jigsaw puzzle with Stan Musial. Donruss did not include extra cards in \\"Super Diamond Kings\\", making this a 26-card set. Dick Perez artwork is used, again, in the \\"Leaf\\" set on two cards, George Bell (213) and Tim Wallach (255), which were not issued in the U.S. set. Two \\"Bonus MVP\\" cards, Tim Raines (211) and George Bell (214), were issued in both the Canadian and U.S. versions of the \\"Leaf\\" set. 1988 was also the last year Donruss issued a \\"Leaf\\" set produced specifically for a Canadian, and later U.S., release. Donruss released many of the same sets in 1989, and three new sets. The base set remained 660-cards. Again, Donruss released \\"Bonus MVP\\" cards randomly inserted into regular set wax packs, along with a jigsaw puzzle piece of Warren Spahn. Donruss did not short print any cards this year. The factory set contained 672-cards. A 12-card \\"Grand Slammers\\" set accompanies the regular 660-card set as an added incentive to purchase a factory set. The \\"Grand Slammers\\" set contained players who hit one or more grand slams in 1988. \\"Grand Slammers\\" were also found in cellophane-wrapped packaged (cello pack) cards. The other new sets for 1989 were a 12-card \\"Blue Chips\\" and a 56-card \\"Traded\\" set. The 12-card \\"Blue Chips\\" set is identical to the \\"Grand Slammers\\" set, except in the place of the \\"Grand Slammers\\" logo is a \\"Blue Chips\\" logo with a Donruss or Leaf trademark. These cards were not issued in factory sets, and are not commonly found among collectors. The \\"Traded\\" set was issued in factory form, featured players that traded teams and card numbers began with a T prefix. 1989 was the first and last time \\"Blue Chips\\" and \\"Traded\\" sets were produced. \\"All-Stars\\", \\"Baseball's Best\\", \\"Pop-Ups\\", \\"Rookies\\" and \\"Super Diamond Kings\\" were produced again in 1989, with a few items of note. No changes to the \\"All- Stars\\" set, but Donruss would not make this particular set again until 1995. Once again, \\"Baseball's Best\\" was sold in big-box stores as a complete factory set. Notable card in this set is Sammy Sosa, Donruss was the only company to release a licensed major league baseball card of him in 1989. Donruss would not produce a \\"Baseball's Best\\" set again until 2001. \\"Pop-Ups\\" increased from a 20-card to 42-card set, and was the last year Donruss produced the set. The \\"Rookies\\" set replaced this year's 15-piece jigsaw puzzle with Warren Spahn. There were no changes to the \\"Super Diamond Kings\\" set. =Increased competition and market saturation= Throughout the 1980s, the baseball card market boomed, with new collectors getting into the hobby as well as speculators hoarding cards in hopes of selling them off later for a tidy profit. Unfortunately, as the \\"Big Three\\" ramped up their production numbers, new brands like Sportflics, Score and Upper Deck crowded the marketplace. Donruss baseball cards were produced continuously from 1981 to 1998, when its then-parent Pinnacle Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Playoff Inc. then purchased the Donruss name and produced Major League Baseball sets again from 2001 to 2005, when Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association revoked the company's production license. It also produced NHL hockey cards from 1992 until 1998, and NFL football cards since 1996. Today, Donruss Playoff LP produces NFL football cards and NBA basketball cards, along with a line of baseball draft picks products and entertainment cards. =End of an era= In the late summer of 2005, Major League Baseball created new license criteria for cardmakers in response to collectors' complaints that: 1) the market had become too fragmented and confusing; and 2) rookie cards were becoming too scarce, with diminished importance due to the race between makers to feature unknown players first. MLB chose to renew only its licenses with Topps and Upper Deck, tacitly sealing the fate of Donruss and Fleer. The last baseball product shipped by the company was the third series of the Playoff- branded Prime Cuts memorabilia cards. Today, Donruss is exclusively a football and basketball card producer. The Score brand was revived in 2005 for the flagship set, while Donruss and Leaf exist as premium brands and Playoff as a memorabilia-oriented brand. In late 2007 however, Donruss did release Donruss Elite Extra Edition, which is its first product outside of the NFL. This product was a multisport release that included cards of the top 30 picks in the 2007 MLB Amateur Draft. Since this product was not licensed by Major League Baseball, the players from the 2007 MLB Amateur Draft were pictured in their high school or college Uniforms and existing Minor Leaguers had their uniforms airbrushed to remove all marks. In addition, there are a number of collegiate themed cards as well as soccer themes. In October 2008, Donruss released Donruss Threads Baseball, featuring a balance of Hall of Famers and young stars. Again, players were either featured in their high school/college uniforms or were photographed so as to make the team logo not visible. The cards also included only the city of the ballplayer, with no mention of the team associated. Donruss used its advantage of not having an MLB license to include baseball cards of both Joe Jackson and Pete Rose, who were banned from baseball for allegedly throwing the World Series in the Black Sox Scandal and betting on the game, respectively. The product included game-used bat cards for Jackson as well as autographed and memorabilia cards from Rose. As of September 28, 2008, Donruss had completely sold out the product to distributors.Donruss Threads Sold Out Summary of baseball cards=Donruss Hall of Fame Diamond King puzzle inserts (1982‚Äì92)= * 1982 Donruss: Babe Ruth * 1983 Donruss: Ty Cobb * 1983 Donruss Action All-Stars: Mickey Mantle * 1984 Donruss: Duke Snider * 1984 Donruss Action All-Stars: Ted Williams * 1985 Donruss: Lou Gehrig * 1986 Donruss: Hank Aaron * 1987 Donruss: Roberto Clemente * 1988 Donruss: Stan Musial * 1989 Donruss: Warren Spahn * 1990 Donruss: Carl Yastrzemski * 1990 Leaf: Yogi Berra * 1991 Donruss: Willie Stargell * 1991 Leaf: Harmon Killebrew * 1992 Donruss: Rod Carew =Donruss \\"King of Kings\\"= In addition to their trademark Diamond Kings subset/insert set, Donruss recognized several \\"King of Kings\\" for extraordinary achievements.

Some consider it to be a political petition designed for disinforming and confusing the public about the scientific results and the consensus of climate change research.Sander van der Linden et al.: Inoculating the Public against Misinformation about Climate Change. In: Global Challenges. Band 1, 2017, doi:10.1002/gch2.201600008 History and signatories The petition was organized and circulated by Arthur B. Robinson, president of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (described as \\"a small independent research group\\") in 1998, and again in 2007. Frederick Seitz, then chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute, wrote a supporting cover letter, signed as \\"Past President National Academy of Sciences USA, President Emeritus Rockefeller University\\".Letter from Frederick Seitz Global Warming Petition Project,Gary J.

The list has been criticized for its lack of verification, with pranksters successfully submitting the names of Charles Darwin, a member of the Spice Girls and characters from Star Wars, and getting them briefly included on the list. Petition text The text of the Global Warming Petition Project reads, in its entirety: > We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement > that was written in Kyoto, Japan in December, 1997, and any other similar > proposals. The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the > environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the > health and welfare of mankind. > There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon > dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the > foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and > disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific > evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many > beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the > Earth. Along with the cover letter from Seitz (see above), the petition was circulated with a manuscript plus a reprint of a December 1997 Wall Street Journal op-ed (\\"Science Has Spoken: Global Warming Is a Myth\\") by Arthur and Zachary Robinson. The current version of Seitz's letter describes the summary as \\"a twelve page review of information on the subject of 'global warming'.\\" The article is titled \\"Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide\\" by Arthur B. Robinson, Noah E. Robinson, Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon. As of October 2007, the petition project website includes an article by Arthur Robinson, Noah E. Robinson and Willie Soon, published in 2007 in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons.Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide by Arthur B. Robinson, Noah E. Robinson, and Willie Soon. Published in The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, 2007; 12(3), 79. The Journal of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is associated with the Oregon Institute, which sponsored the petition. The publication, which is not indexed alongside peer-reviewed journals, is the outlet of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which is a libertarian political organization.Oreskes & Conway, pp. 232 & 245. Signatories The Oregon Petition Project clarified their verification process as follows: *The petitioners could submit responses only by physical mail, not electronic mail, to limit fraud. Older signatures submitted via the web were not removed. The verification of the scientists was listed at 95%, but the means by which this verification was done was not specified. *Signatories to the petition were requested to list an academic degree.OISM Mail-in Petition The petition sponsors stated that approximately two thirds held higher degrees. As of 2013, the petition's website states, \\"The current list of 31,487 petition signers includes 9,029 PhD; 7,157 MS; 2,586 MD and DVM; and 12,715 BS or equivalent academic degrees. Most of the MD and DVM signers also have underlying degrees in basic science.\\" *Petitioners were also requested to list their academic discipline. As of 2007, about 2,400 people in addition to the original 17,100 signatories were \\"trained in fields other than science or whose field of specialization was not specified on their returned petition.\\" The petition sponsors state the following numbers of individuals from each discipline: Atmospheric, Environmental and Earth sciences: 3,805 (Climatology: 39) Computer and Mathematical sciences: 935 Physics & Aerospace sciences: 5,812 Chemistry: 4,822 Biochemistry, Biology, and Agriculture: 2,965 Medicine: 3,046 Engineering and General Science: 10,102 =Credentials and authenticity= The credentials, verification process, and authenticity of the signatories have been questioned. Jeff Jacoby promoted the Oregon Institute petition as delegates convened for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1998. Jacoby, a columnist for The Boston Globe, said event organizers \\"take it for granted\\" that global warming is real when scientists do not agree \\"that greater concentrations of CO2 would be harmful\\" or \\"that human activity leads to global warming in the first place.\\"Jeff Jacoby. Scientists don't agree on global warming, The Boston Globe. 5 November 1998. George Woodwell and John Holdren, two members of the National Academy of Sciences, responded to Jacoby in the International Herald Tribune, describing the petition as a \\"farce\\" in part because \\"the signatories are listed without titles or affiliations that would permit an assessment of their credentials.\\"George Woodwell and John Holdren. Climate-Change Skeptics Are Wrong New York Times. November 14, 1998. Myanna Lahsen said, \\"Assuming that all the signatories reported their credentials accurately, credentialed climate experts on the list are very few.\\" The problem is made worse, Lahsen notes, because critics \\"added bogus names to illustrate the lack of accountability the petition involved\\". Spurious names on the list included fictional characters from the television show M*A*S*H,Joseph H. Hubert Odd Names Added to Greenhouse Plea Associated Press. (abridged version) 1 May 1998. the movie Star Wars, Spice Girls group member Geri Halliwell, English naturalist Charles Darwin (d. 1882) and prank names such as \\"I. C. Ewe\\".David McNeely. It‚Äôs easy for pseudoscientists to mislead people, Edmond Sun. February 22, 2006. When questioned about the pop singer during a telephone interview with Joseph Hubert of the Associated Press, Robinson acknowledged that her endorsement and degree in microbiology was inauthentic, remarking \\"When we're getting thousands of signatures there's no way of filtering out a fake\\". A cursory examination by Todd Shelly of the Hawaii Reporter revealed duplicate entries, single names lacking any initial, and even corporate names. \\"These examples underscore a major weakness of the list: there is no way to check the authenticity of the names. Names are given, but no identifying information (e.g., institutional affiliation) is provided.\\"Todd Shelly. Bashing the Scientific Consensus on Global Warming, Hawaii Reporter. 14 July 2005. According to the Petition Project website, the issue of duplication has been resolved. Kevin Grandia offered similar criticism, saying that, although the Petition Project website provides a breakdown of \\"areas of expertise\\", it fails to assort the 0.5% of signatories who claim to have a background in Climatology and Atmospheric Science by name, making independent verification difficult. \\"This makes an already questionable list seem completely insignificant\\".Kevin Grandia. The 30,000 Global Warming Petition Is Easily- Debunked The Huffington Post. October 27, 2012.

NAS incident  A manuscript accompanying the petition was presented in a near identical style and format to contributions that appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific journal, but upon careful examination was distinct from a publication by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Raymond Pierrehumbert, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Chicago, said the presentation was \\"designed to be deceptive by giving people the impression that the article ‚Ä¶ is a reprint and has passed peer review.\\" Pierrehumbert also said the publication was full of \\"half-truths\\". F. Sherwood Rowland, who was at the time foreign secretary of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the Academy received numerous inquiries from researchers who \\"are wondering if someone is trying to hoodwink them.\\" After the petition appeared, the National Academy of Sciences said in a 1998 news release that \\"The NAS Council would like to make it clear that this petition has nothing to do with the National Academy of Sciences and that the manuscript was not published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences or in any other peer-reviewed journal.\\" It also said \\"The petition does not reflect the conclusions of expert reports of the Academy.\\" The NAS further noted that its own prior published study had shown that \\"even given the considerable uncertainties in our knowledge of the relevant phenomena, greenhouse warming poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses. Investment in mitigation measures acts as insurance protection against the great uncertainties and the possibility of dramatic surprises.\\" Robinson responded in a 1998 article in Science, \\"I used the Proceedings as a model, but only to put the information in a format that scientists like to read, not to fool people into thinking it is from a journal.\\" A 2006 article in the magazine Vanity Fair stated: > Today, Seitz admits that \\"it was stupid\\" for the Oregon activists to copy > the academy's format. Still, he doesn't understand why the academy felt > compelled to disavow the petition, which he continues to cite as proof that > it is \\"not true\\" there is a scientific consensus on global warming.

It is located west of Bloomington in Owen County. History The park was named after the area's first settler, John McCormick, who settled on there in 1816, along the canyon by the waterfalls. Up to that time, the land had been hunted by Miami Indians. McCormick's Creek Falls is the main attraction at McCormick's Creek State Park. On May 12, 1916, a local newspaper editor suggested to an Indiana state legislator that the McCormick's Creek area would be a suitable location for a state park. German-born Indianapolis businessman Richard Lieber championed the idea of establishing a system of state parks for Indiana, and, after winning the property at auction with a bid of $5,250, received it from the Dr. Frederick Denkewalter estate.Indiana and Indianans: A History of Aboriginal and Territorial Indiana and the Century of Statehood By Jacob Piatt Dunn pg.51 McCormick's Creek was formally opened on December 11, 1916; the centennial birthday of Indiana. In 1927 a naturalist program was started, a first for Indiana and the United States.http://www.in.gov/dnr/3245.htm Official (Indiana) DNR Historical Timeline Much of the infrastructure of the park was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal era, and many of the CCC-built structures, retaining walls, and elegant, arched limestone bridges remain in use today. The park entrance gatehouse, former nature center, and a stone arch bridge over McCormick's Creek were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. There are eight numbered hiking trails in the park, accessing features and park attractions, which include a fire tower, a scenic ravine and waterfall, small cave, sinkhole formations, and towering stands of second-growth Midwestern hardwoods. The park also features a fine system of equestrian paths. Also on site is The Canyon Inn, a former sanitarium that now hosts guests for the night. It has an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Overnight camping is also available. In addition, the Old State House quarry is a source of the Indiana limestone used in the Indiana State Capitol building. Canyon McCormick's Creek fallsThe heart of the park is McCormick's Creek Canyon. The upper levels of the canyon are around above sea levels, dropping to the West Fork of the White River which is near . Waterfall The McCormick's Creek waterfall is a primary attraction of the park, as Indiana has few waterfalls due to the relatively flat topography of the state. Hiking Trails Wolf Cave Trail Wolf Cave Nature Preserve Trail #5. The Wolf Cave Trail is considered to be of MODERATE difficulty. The trail is long, and it loops through the Wolf Cave Nature Preserve. It is relatively level with a drop into a shallow valley. The trail begins at the Wolf Cave Parking Area. The forest along the route is a Beech-Maple forest. Wolf Cave was formed by the collapse of a cave, leaving only the middle section 'the cave' still roofed.McCormick's Creek State Park Map, Indiana Dept of Natural Resources McCormick's Creek Falls Trail Trail #3. This short is considered RUGGED. The trail begins across from Canyon Inn and drops down before rising at the edge of McCormick's Creek Canyon.

The college has two campuses, Lansdowne and Interurban, with a total enrollment of ~20,000 students (including Continuing Education). Camosun College also provides contract training for local business; research, innovation and prototyping services for industry; and trained co-op students for employers. The Lansdowne campus provides University transfer and access programs, as well as career, technical and vocational programs in the fields of the arts, sciences, business, health and human services. The Interurban campus delivers programs in the trades, technologies, business, sport and exercise education, and access programs. The college also hosts a student paper, The Nexus. The enabling legislation is the College and Institute Act.http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/C/96052_01.htm College and Institute Act Student body As of the 2013‚Äì14 fiscal year, Camosun had more than 19,000 full-time and part-time students (9,793 full-time equivalents [FTEs]) between its Lansdowne and Interurban campuses. About 1,000 Aboriginal students from 50 First Nations including M√©tis and Inuit groups, and over 1,100 international students from 60 different countries attend the college each year. History The Young Building at Lansdowne Campus The roots of the college began in 1914 when the Young Building was built as Victoria's first Normal School on part of a plot belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company, now part of the Lansdowne Campus. The school's enrollment at the time was about 275. During the Second World War, the Young Building was converted into a military hospital. In 1946, the building was returned to its original function as an educational institution shared between the Normal School and Victoria College, which were united in 1956. In 1967, the Normal School and Victoria College moved to the site of the Gordon Head Campus of the University of Victoria and the Institute of Adult Studies was established by the Greater Victoria School Board. The Institute of Adult Studies was located in what is currently the Ewing Building, and was the first centre in Canada to offer daytime courses for adults wishing to upgrade to high school graduation. Local interest in a community college grew, and on October 9, 1970, Victoria residents voted in favour of establishing a college. Plans for \\"Juan de Fuca\\" College were followed. The provincial government formally approved the college on October 27, 1970. In 1971 the college councillors voted on a name change, and \\"Camosun\\" (pronounced Cam-≈å-sun) was chosen, as it had been an early name for Victoria. It is originally a Lkwungen (Songhees) name for an area of Victoria where different waters meet and are transformed. By September 1971, the final steps toward the realization of a college were taken when Camosun (Lansdowne campus) and the BC Vocational School (Interurban campus) merged to become BC's ninth community college. The trade-mark with the words 'Camosun College' was filed with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office Canadian Trade-marks database on 2008-02-22.http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic- cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do;jsessionid=0001nQO0GxekC2eNmFOKWl6CdPN:1LNLUVUR73?lang=eng&status;=&fileNumber;=1384577&extension;=0&startingDocumentIndexOnPage;=1 trade-mark Camosun College enrolled its first students in September 1971 when it opened as a two-year institution offering university transfer, vocational and upgrading courses to the residents of southern Vancouver Island.

The domed ceiling The London Coliseum (also known as the Coliseum Theatre) is a Wrenaissance theatre in St Martin's Lane, Westminster, built as one of London's largest and most luxurious \\"family\\" variety theatres. Opened on 24 December 1904 as the London Coliseum Theatre of Varieties, it was designed by the theatrical architect Frank Matcham for the impresario Oswald Stoll. Their ambition was to build the largest and finest music hall, described as the \\"people's palace of entertainment\\" of its age. At the time of construction, the Coliseum was the only theatre in Europe to provide lifts for taking patrons to the upper levels of the house, and was the first theatre in England to have a triple revolve installed on its stage. The theatre has 2,359 seats making it the largest theatre in London. After being used for variety shows, musical comedies, and stage plays for many years, then as a cinema screening films in the Cinerama format between 1963 and 1968, the Sadler's Wells Opera Company moved into the building in 1968. The Sadler's Wells company changed its name to the English National Opera in 1974 and today it is used primarily for opera as well as being the London home of the English National Ballet.  History  The London Coliseum was built by the theatrical architect Frank Matcham who intended it to be one of London's largest and most luxurious \\"family\\" variety theatres. Construction began in 1903 and the venue opened on 24 December the following year as the London Coliseum Theatre of Varieties. It is located in St Martin's Lane, London.\\"History of the Coliseum\\" , English National Opera, accessed 26 July 2015. Matcham built the theatre for the theatrical impresario Sir Oswald Stoll and had the ambition of it being the largest and finest \\"People‚Äôs palace of entertainment\\" of the age. Matcham wanted a Theatre of Variety ‚Äì not a music hall but equally not highbrow entertainment. The resulting programme was a mix of music hall and variety theatre, with one act - a full scale revolving chariot race - requiring the stage to revolve. The theatre's original slogan was PRO BONO PUBLICO (For the public good). It was opened in 1904 and the inaugural performance was a variety bill on 24 December that year. English Heritage, in its description of the theatre when it was given listed status in 1960 notes that it is \\"exuberant Free Baroque ambitious design, the Edwardian \\"Theatre de Luxe of London\\" with richly decorated interiors and a vast and grandiose auditorium.\\" The description continues: \\"Lavish foyer and circulation areas with marble facings, culminating in vast 3-tier auditorium with wealth of eclectic classical detail of Byzantine opulence, some motifs such as the squat columns dividing the lowest tier of slip boxes, backing the stalls, almost Sullivanesque; pairs of 2-tiered bow fronted boxes with domed canopies at gallery level and semi-domed, Ionic-columned pairs of 2 tiered orchestra boxes, contained in arched and pedimented frames surmounted by sculptural groups with lion-drawn chariots. Great, semi-circular, blocked architrave proscenium arch with cartouche- trophy keystone.\\" The inaugural performance was a variety bill on 24 December 1904, but it \\"was a total failure and closed down completely only two years after opening in 1906 and remained closed until December of 1907 when it was reopened and at last became successful.\\" In 1908, the London Coliseum was host to a cricket match between Middlesex and Surrey. In 1911, dramatist W. S. Gilbert produced his last play here, The Hooligan. The theatre changed its name from the London Coliseum to the Coliseum Theatre between 1931 and 1968 when a run of 651 performances of the musical comedy White Horse Inn began on 8 April 1931. Additionally, Arthur Lewis notes that: :Pantomimes began in 1936 with Cinderella and continued regularly until 1946. In 1947 the musical Annie Get Your Gun was staged at the Coliseum and had a staggeringly successful run for the time, of 1,304 performances and three continuous years which was the longest run in theatrical history. There then followed a long run of major American hits beginning with Kiss Me, Kate in 1951, Guys And Dolls in 1953, Pajama Game in 1955, and Damn Yankees in 1957. But this exceptional period did at last come to an end in 1957 when the production of The Bells Are Ringing failed to enthrall anyone. The Coliseum reverted to the original name when the Sadler's Wells Opera Company moved there in 1968 and, in 1974, the Company changed its name to become the English National Opera; it bought the freehold of the building for ¬£12.8 million in 1992. The Coliseum hosted both the 2004 and 2006 Royal Variety Performances and is also the London base for performances by English National Ballet, which perform regular seasons throughout the year when not on tour. The Who performed there and recorded their concert, on 14 December 1969.  Technical aspects  While its wing space is limited due to the constricted site on which the theatre was built, as Lloyd notes, \\"the stage of the London Coliseum was also on a vast scale; 55 feet wide by 92 feet deep\\". The stage is not raked. It has the widest proscenium arch in London and was one of the first to have electric lighting. It was built with a triple revolving stage, although this was rarely used. The Coliseum was designed to seat 2,358 people on four levels. As such it is the largest of all London's theatres. The theatre retains many of its original features and was given a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage in September 1960. Prior to Sadler's Wells Opera Company taking over the Coliseum in 1968, the house was \\"fully restored, redecorated, and a large orchestra pit installed\\". It reopened on 21 August 1968, with a production of the opera Don Giovanni. Another extensive renovation took place between 2000 and 2004. when the design team included the architects RHWL and Arup as acousticians and building engineers. The London Coliseum has two lifts which provide step-free access for disabled patrons to all levels, except the Upper Circle. Use as a cinema Periodically, the Coliseum was used to show films and, when the \\"'talkies' arrived at the Coliseum in 1933, films were run at the theatre for a year. The greatest sensation at this time was the showing of King Kong which ran at the Coliseum for months with 10,000 people seeing the film there every day.\\" After a lacklustre period of poorly received musicals came to an end, in June 1961 the theatre was leased by MGM for use as a cinema during the period that the Empire, Leicester Square was closed for rebuilding. The initial presentation, from 6 June, was a revival of Gone With the Wind which ran for 3 months. On 2 November the World Premiere of Bachelor in Paradise took place in the presence of the film's star, Bob Hope, and following this, on 15 November, was the UK premiere of Samuel Bronston's epic King of Kings. MGM continued to use the theatre even after the new Empire, Leicester Square reopened in December 1962, but MGM's lease expired on 19 May 1963 and the theatre was then leased by the Cinerama Corporation to become the second of London's Cinerama locations (after the Casino Cinerama). Conversion to three-strip projection which used three projectors was undertaken, and an 80 ft wide, 30 ft tall deeply curved screen was installed. Beginning on 16 July 1963, the theatre was renamed the Coliseum Cinerama, with the UK premiere of The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm. This film transferred to the third of London's Cinerama houses, the Royalty Theatre on 27 November and the Coliseum was converted for single-projector Cinerama using 70mm film for the Gala UK Premiere of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World on 2 December 1963. Other 70mm films followed, The Magnificent Showman (the UK Title of Circus World), The Great Race (a 35mm \\"blow up\\") and The Bible. With fewer films made in the format, it later became difficult to programme the theatre. It resorted to revivals of old 70mm movies before opening The Comedians on January 18, 1968 (a 70mm Panavision blow up). This ran for nine weeks and was followed by a revival of the 1956 Todd-AO epic Around the World in 80 Days, the first time this film had been shown in 70mm in London. This ran until 22 May 1968 when Cinerama pulled out and the theatre reverted to live use.

The was a diplomatic intervention by Russia, Germany, and France on 23 April 1895 over the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki signed between Japan and Qing dynasty China that ended the First Sino-Japanese War. The goal was to stop Japanese expansion in China. The Japanese reaction against the Triple Intervention was one of the causes of the subsequent Russo-Japanese War.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 375. Treaty of Shimonoseki Per the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Japan was awarded the Liaodong Peninsula including the harbor city of Port Arthur, which it had conquered from China. Immediately after the terms of the treaty became public, Russia‚Äîwith its own designs and sphere of influence in China‚Äîexpressed concern about Japanese acquisition of the Liaodong Peninsula and the possible impact of the terms of the treaty on the stability of China. Russia persuaded France and Germany to apply diplomatic pressure on Japan for return of the territory to China in exchange for a larger indemnity.Marius B. Jansen, Japan and China: From War to Peace, 1894-1972 (1975) pp 17-29, 66-77. The European powers Russia had the most to gain out of the Triple Intervention. In the preceding years, Russia had been slowly increasing its influence in the Far East. The construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the acquisition of a warm-water port would enable Russia to consolidate its presence in the region and further expand into Asia and the Pacific. Russia had not expected that Japan would be victorious against China. Port Arthur falling into Japanese hands would undermine its own desperate need for a warm-water port in the East. Frank W. Ikle, \\"The Triple Intervention. Japan's Lesson in the Diplomacy of Imperialism.\\" Monumenta Nipponica 22.1/2 (1967): 122-130. France was obligated to join Russia under the 1892 treaty. Although French bankers did have financial interests in Russia (especially railroads), France had no territorial ambitions in Manchuria, since its sphere of influence was in southern China (see Sino-French War). The French actually had cordial relations with the Japanese: French military advisors had been sent to train the Imperial Japanese Army and a number of Japanese ships had been built in French shipyards. However, France did not wish to be diplomatically isolated, as it had been previously, especially given the growing power of Germany. Urs Matthias Zachmann, \\"Imperialism in a Nutshell: Conflict and the Concert of Powers' in the Tripartite Intervention, 1895.\\" Japanstudien 17.1 (2006): 57-82. Germany had two reasons to support Russia: firstly, its desire to draw Russia's attention to the east and away from itself and secondly, to enlist Russia's support in establishing German territorial concessions in China. Germany hoped that support for Russia would encourage Russia, in turn, to support Germany's colonial ambitions, which were especially vexed since Germany had only recently formed itself into a unified nation and had arrived late in the colonial \\"game.\\" Conclusion The Japanese government reluctantly acceded to the intervention, as British and American diplomatic intercession was not forthcoming, and Japan was in no position to militarily resist three major European powers simultaneously. The three powers had 38 warships with a displacement of 95,000 tons already deployed in East Asia, whereas the Imperial Japanese Navy had only 31 warships in total with a displacement of 57,000 tons. After futile diplomatic efforts to enlist the support of the United States and Great Britain, on 5 May 1895, Prime Minister It≈ç Hirobumi announced the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for an additional indemnity of 30 million kuping taels (450 million yen). The last Japanese troops departed in December. Much to Japan's astonishment and consternation, Russia moved almost immediately to occupy the entire Liaodong Peninsula and especially to fortify Port Arthur. Germany secured control over concessions in Shandong Province, and France, and even Great Britain took advantage of the weakened China to seize port cities on various pretexts and to expand their spheres of influence. Japan's government felt it had been cheated of its deserved spoils of war by this intervention. This humiliation at the hands of the European powers helped lead to the movement. Figuratively translated as \\"Persevering through Hardship (for the sake of revenge)\\", the saying is derived from the Chinese chengyu of w√≤xƒ´nch√°ngd«én (), literally meaning \\"sleeping on sticks and tasting gall\\", that alludes to the perseverance of King Goujian of Yue (reigned 496‚Äì465 BC) in the War between Wu and Yue. For modern Japan, this ideology meant an increase in heavy industry and strength of the armed forces, especially the navy, at the expense of individual wants and needs. The Triple Intervention had a profound effect on Japanese foreign relations, as Japanese diplomacy sought to avoid a reconstitution of a combination of European Powers against Japan. It led directly to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 which was explicitly intended to shield Japan from interference from other European Great Powers, and from Russia in particular.

The web site was founded in 2007, expanding on PFAW's earlier practice of VHS recording controversial clips from conservative television programs, such as Pat Robertson's 700 Club, for distribution to news media. In 2013, evangelist and politician Gordon Klingenschmitt sent DMCA takedown notices for Right Wing Watch's using clips of his program, in which Right Wing Watch was defended by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In 2014, Jason and David Benham lost the opportunity to host their own HGTV television show after Right Wing Watch labeled the brothers as \\"anti-gay, anti-choice extremists\\" because of their statements at various events about homosexuality. In 2018, Jared Holt, a Right Wing Watch researcher, was credited for getting conservative radio show host Alex Jones's InfoWars program removed from multiple content distribution sites, including Apple, Inc, YouTube, Facebook, and Spotify.

It engages the use of prayer, forgiveness, repentance, rejecting lies and replacing them with truth, and processing painful memories to bring emotional and spiritual healing. History and description Practitioners in the Inner Healing Movement may not always have formal training in counseling or psychology. Christian psychologist and academic Fernando Garzon views this in a positive light, saying: \\"it may serve people who might not get help otherwise, cannot afford professional therapy, do not wish to use insurance, or have access to counseling limited by managed care. Others belong to churches in which the pastor is either are not trained, not interested, or not available (due to having too many other pastoral duties) to meet the needs for pastoral counseling. Still others simply may trust lay people, whom they know, more than a therapist, whom they do not know. In addition, the training itself may benefit the lay counselors spiritually and emotionally.\\"Lay Christian Counseling and Client Expectations for Integration in Therapy Journal of Psychology and Christianity (in press) Garzon et al, Liberty University = How the Inner Healing Movement started = Agnes Sanford (1897‚Äì1982) is considered to be the mother of the inner healing movement, and with her husband founded The Agnes Sanford School of Pastoral Care in 1958. She was the daughter of a Presbyterian missionary in China, and the wife of an Episcopal rector. In the early 1900s, she was part of the healing revivals and charismatic renewal in the United States. As she saw miraculous healings in the physical, with big tent meetings ministering to large groups, she began to see the need for more individualized ministry and addressing emotional and spiritual wounds as well as the physical. She worked with churches as early as the 1930s teaching them to pray for mental and emotional issues before inner healing was even a term they would have used. Her first book, The Healing Light, is considered classic in its field. Agnes was the mother of Jungian analyst Jack Sanford. The inner healing movement is also often compared and associated with Inner Healing and Healing of Memories. Other people who feature prominently in its history are Ruth Carter Stapleton,Time Magazine Obituary: Monday, Oct. 10, 1983 Ruth Carter Stapleton Leanne Payne, Francis MacNutt and Charles Fillmore. A number of organizations are currently active, including Elijah House,Elijah House Ministries of Pastoral Care,Ministries of Pastoral Care and Sozo Ministries.Sozo Ministries Another important part of Christian Inner Healing Methods is the active involvement of God in the healing work taking place. The belief that God heals both physical and mental problems is a long-standing Christian belief, originating in traditional Jewish beliefs.  Key figures in the Inner Healing Movement  John and Paula Sandford the founders of Elijah House were heavily influenced by Agnes Sanford (no relation) and served to clarify and further her teachings. In 1958 the Sandfords encountered the charismatic revivals and were filled with the Holy Spirit. After several years of learning in ministry, the Sandfords founded Elijah House in 1975. Their ministry has grown over the decades and continues to thrive both in the United States and internationally through their partner ministries. Paula Sandford passed away in 2012 and John followed in 2018. Elijah House ministries is carried on by their son Mark and other ministry partners they gained over the years. Leanne Payne is considered the mother of listening prayer. In the late '80s and early '90s she released several books that teach listening prayer and how it can be applied to a variety of issues. Rusty Rustenbach is the most prominent current teacher of this method. His book A Guide for Listening and Inner Healing Prayer draws from Payne‚Äôs work and leads the reader through personal inner healing and journaling. Many inner healing approaches now incorporate some aspect of listening prayer. While the listening prayer approach is rather basic, it was revolutionary for its time. The idea that you could listen in prayer and hear from God, not just by reading scripture, but hear real relevant answers to the deep hurts and questions you carry, was a paradigm-shifting concept in the church. Ed Smith, a pastoral counselor, founded Theophostic Prayer Ministry in 1996. In his work with clients Smith became frustrated seeing his clients get better at symptom management, but never finding lasting change and the freedom they longed for. Ultimately Smith realized that it wasn‚Äôt just the past traumas of his clients that were holding them back, it was the beliefs they had come under in light of those traumas. These lenses of belief were shading everything in the clients‚Äô lives and driving the relentless emotional pain and struggle. As Smith determined, ‚ÄúIf the past is the problem, then there is no present solution. were true that our past is the root of our current problem then there is no remedy, since the past cannot be changed. However, if our current trouble is rooted in what we currently believe -even though we learned it in an earlier life experience- the belief is changeable even though the past is not.‚Äù Yet simply knowing the truth wasn‚Äôt setting his clients free either. One day Smith had a client that was having strong memories of a past abuse, she was wrestling with the belief that it was all her fault, even though she knew that wasn‚Äôt true. Out of ideas, Smith prayed out-loud, ‚ÄúJesus is there anything you want her to know about this memory?‚Äù After a few moments the woman reported that Jesus had met her in that memory and told her it was not her fault. Hearing it straight from God is what she needed for her head and heart to finally agree on the truth and release the lies she had believed. After this client session, Smith began to try this technique with other clients, asking Jesus to show them where he was in their memories of trauma and letting him tell them the truth they needed to hear. This process became the core tool of Theophostic and the foundation for the method Smith developed and trained others in. The name Theophostic comes from the Greek words theos meaning God, and phos meaning light. The goal of Theophostic is to shine God‚Äôs light on our dark and hurting places. In 2016 Theophostic rebranded as Transformation Prayer Ministry and totally redid their training material and re-launched it as an online training. They changed names to emphasize the transformation clients go through when God‚Äôs truth lights up their dark places. And streamlined the training to make it easier to learn. Dawna DeSilva and Teresa Liebscher are the founders of Sozo ministry, developed in the late 90s. In 1997 they learned a deliverance tool from Argentina called the Four Doors. As they served together on the prayer line at Bethel Church in Redding, California, they began experimenting with this tool and found that these four doors that the demonic can gain access to our lives through were a very effective tool for releasing inner healing even in short prayer sessions. Over the years they picked up more tools such as the Father Ladder and more advanced tools from teachings by Aiko Hormann and their own personal discovery as they have worked with people over the years. ‚ÄúIn 1998 other churches and organizations requested the Sozo Ministry to share what God had started. Thus, the Bethel Sozo Ministry started traveling to train and equip other churches and organizations to start their own Sozo Ministry. We have traveled international and to numerous states for this training and equipping. In 2005, the Bethel Sozo Ministry so covered the globe, that the International Bethel Sozo Organization was created to aid and support all the Bethel Sozo Ministry Teams around the world.‚Äù - From the Bethel Sozo website The Bethel Sozo network now has practitioners in over twenty-two countries and in most US states. Chester and Betsy Kylstra founded Restoring the Foundations in 1992. While they were working in ministry God revealed to them four areas of healing that needed to be addressed to bring true freedom. These four areas became the fundamental structures of Restoring the Foundations. By 2000, the Kylstras had more than sixteen team members ministering along with them and in 2001 they established the Healing House Network to expand their training and ministry covering. In 2004 they purchased an inn in North Carolina that became their headquarters and training center, where they also offered retreats. In 2014 the Kylstras transitioned the ministry leadership to their successors, Lee and Cindi Whitman. The Whitman‚Äôs have continued the mission and vision of Restoring the Foundations and in 2018 were led by the Lord to move the headquarters to Nashville, TN. Timothy Davis started Cleansing Streams in the late 80s first as a deliverance and discipleship ministry out of Church on the Way. It began as a couples Bible study but the requests for it were so great they expanded it into a group class format. They wanted to avoid pitfalls of previous deliverance ministries. And so discipleship was always the focus along with deliverance ministry. Over time it evolved from just a deliverance ministry into an inner healing ministry as well, gaining insight from RTF ministry. Jack Hayford, lead pastor at Church on the Way became a prominent supporter of Cleansing Streams and still sits on their board. In the late '90s Davis experienced a personal breakdown that resulted in him parting ways with Cleansing Streams. The ministry continued under the leadership of Hayford and the Church on the Way and is now led by Chris Hayward and his wife, Karen. Dr. Karl Lehman developed the Immanuel Approach over decades of working with clients. As a psychiatrist, he has worked hard to integrate Christian faith- based approaches with scientifically backed psychological and neurological research. In the early 90s, Dr. Lehman was very simply praying with clients and inviting Jesus into the counseling process. In 1995 he learned about trauma processing from EMDR (a trauma counseling approach). He began incorporating some tools from EMDR with his counseling and prayer tools and gained a greater agility in troubleshooting when a client would get stuck. In 1998 Dr. Lehman learned about Theophostic and was impressed with how it combined the foundational principles of everything he knew at the time about trauma processing. He began to incorporate tools from Theophostic into his counseling. As he worked with clients using these new tools, Dr. Lehman found that there was a cap on the capacity for some clients to engage with their trauma memories and get free. Despite the client‚Äôs desire to process the memories they often would get stuck and either shut down when they got to a certain point or struggle to connect with the memory at all. In the early 2000s, frustrated and longing to see his clients totally free, Dr. Lehman prayed asking God to show him what he was missing. It then dawned on him that this whole time the focus had been on the traumatic memories themselves and then bringing Jesus into them. He wondered what would happen if instead he began the session focused on Jesus and made the goal of each session connecting with Jesus and removing anything blocking that connection, rather than having the primary goal of removing the trauma. He found this approach to be extremely effective and developed into what is now known as the Immanuel Approach. In the 1990s, Father Andrew, an evangelical episcopal priest and licensed social worker, began developing tools for healing the brokenhearted and in 2010 officially launched HeartSync as a ministry and began training others. In 2018 HeartSync ministries established their official training requirements for being certified as a HeartSync minister. Teresa Liebscher, co-founder of Sozo, founded Shabar ministry in 2002. It developed out of the Sozo ministry when they had clients that struggled to hold onto their healing despite extensive inner healing work. It gets its name from Isaiah 61:1 from the Hebrew word Shabar, meaning ‚Äúbroken-hearted‚Äù or ‚Äúshattered‚Äù. Their mission is to bring knowledge, hope, and wholeness to ‚Äúshattered‚Äù individuals. Both Shabar and HeartSync are designed to work with ‚Äúbroken-hearted‚Äù or ‚Äúshattered‚Äù individuals - what the mental health world may identify as dissociative identity disorder or multiple personality disorder. (DID and MPD are mental health diagnosis terms. We do not diagnose or treat mental health issues in inner healing.) Both of these approaches work by guiding the client to speak with God and allow various parts of themselves to join the conversation.  Mind-body work with inner healing  More recent inner healing models have combined mind-body work with traditional inner healing prayer structures. Such models incorporate meridian-based energy healing from a Christian perspective and within the bounds of traditional Evangelical theology. Splankna is a model developed by Christian professional counselor, Sarah Thiessen. Starting in 1997, Thiessen had several encounters with chiropractic and alternative healing that sent her on a researching journey. At first she was concerned these methods of healing were New Age, but as God kept bumping her into it, she finally decided to see what he was trying to show her. Through a seven year process of development Thiessen got trained in TFT, EFT, and another energy healing model called NET (neuro-emotive technique) which is primarily used by chiropractors. With these trainings she examined what was good that worked because God made it to work, and what were views attached to what worked that could be stripped away and replaced with God‚Äôs truth about it. This journey of development resulted in what is now called Splankna - the first Christian approach to energy healing. In the early 2000s Thiessen began training others in Splankna and the Splankna Therapy Institute now has over 2,000 practitioners trained worldwide. Christian EFT Sherrie Rice Smith, RN has written several books on using EFT from a Christian perspective and has trained many EFT practitioners in this faith based approach. She is a pioneer in Christian approaches to mind-body work and her books provide a scientific basis for EFT as well as ways to incorporate scripture with tapping. Thought Therapy (CTT) was developed in 2016, by Leah Lesesne, an inner healing practitioner with a counseling masters. Lesesne started out in the inner healing world with the Elijah House School of Prayer Ministry, and got trained in Splankna and TFT as she completed her masters. After working for a few years in the mental health world of counseling, Lesesne became frustrated with the current options for helping clients with trauma and the lack of inner healing applications even in Christian settings. She knew that Splankna, EFT, and TFT had solutions that worked, but she saw how Christians sometimes rejected these models of healing, even Splankna a Christian approach, often because of concerns around the use of muscle testing (a method of applied kinesiology to allow the subconscious to confirm emotional content). While she saw value to muscle testing, Lesesne saw the opportunity for a listening prayer approach to be used instead to identify emotional content. She began using the information she knew from TFT and Splankna about the meridian system combined with listening prayer to walk her clients through inner healing that addresses body, mind, and spirit and found just as much success with this method as with using the muscle testing. In addition to her own practice and CTT trainings, she now runs The Inner Healing School to train up the next generation of inner healing practitioners.  Concerns about memory work  Theophostic Prayer Ministry (TPM) techniques and other inner healing models that incorporate memory work have become popular. However, some have concerns about these approaches with some of their underlying principles being compared with those of Recovered Memory Therapy (RMT).Controversial international ministry operates from Campbellsville ‚Äì Central Kentucky News Journal, July 2, 2003 by Jan Fletcher In the Journal of Psychology and Theology, Spring 2004, Christian psychologist David Entwistle summarized some concerns associated with Theophostic methods: 'TPM follows in the lineage of \\"healing of memory\\" techniques, though it departs from that lineage in a number of important respects. Numerous concerns exist surrounding insufficient attempts to ground TPM in biblical concepts; inadequate and often flawed explanations of basic psychological processes; dubious claims about the prevalence of DID, SRA, and demonic activity; estimates of traumatic abuse that exceed empirical findings; and the failure to sufficiently appreciate the possibility of iatrogenic memory contamination.'Shedding light on Theophostic Ministry 1: practice issues ‚Äì Journal of Psychology and Theology, Spring 2004, by David N. Entwistle It is important to note that TPM and others such as Da Silva and Liebscher of Sozo ministry, denounce used of memory recovery as described in the above concerns. Practitioners of their methods that have strayed from the standard teaching seem to be the source of these concerning practices. Christians across multiple denominations have various concerns about \\"inner healing\\" in general as well as specific ministries listed in this article as to if they are biblical (in alignment with scripture). Practices tend to rely on testimonials to promote and came about by \\"revelation\\" exclusively. Agnes Sanford's book, \\"The Healing Light\\" has descriptions of God and the Holy Spirit that could be read as coming from a universalist perspective or eastern mysticism.

The film is adapted from the 1992 play Hospitality Suite, written by Roger Rueff, who also wrote the screenplay. John Swanbeck makes few attempts to lessen this film's resemblance to a stage performance: the majority of the film takes place in a single hotel room, and nearly every single line of dialogue is spoken by one of the three actors. The famous 1997 essay Wear Sunscreen is featured at the end of the film. Plot Larry Mann (Kevin Spacey) and Phil Cooper (Danny DeVito), who are both experienced marketing representatives working for an industrial lubricants company, attend a trade convention in Wichita, Kansas, in the American Midwest. They are joined in their hospitality suite by Bob Walker (Peter Facinelli), a young man from the company's research department. Larry and Phil are close friends with a long history together. Larry faces urgent financial difficulties that he alludes to only obliquely; Phil has recently come through a recovery program for alcoholism. Bob, an earnest young Baptist, has few if any regrets. Larry explains that their single goal is to arrange a meeting with Dick Fuller, the CEO of a large company (\\"the Big Kahuna\\"). While the three wait in their suite for the convention downstairs to finish, Larry and Phil explain to Bob how to develop and discern character. They also make Bob the bartender for the evening even though he drinks infrequently. Larry remarks that as he has quit smoking, Phil has quit drinking and Bob is religious, it makes them \\"practically Jesus\\". Even though he makes a poor bartender, Bob spends the evening talking to people. In doing so, he inadvertently chats with the Big Kahuna, who invites him over to a private party at another hotel. Larry and Phil excitedly coach Bob through their pitch on industrial lubricants down to an amount of information Bob can handle and supply him with their business cards. As the pair wait for Bob, they reflect on the nature of human life. However, Bob returns to drop a bombshell: he used the time to discuss religion rather than pitch the company's product. Larry, dumbfounded, challenges Bob and leaves the room devastated. Phil explains to Bob that proselytizing is just another kind of sales pitch. He explains that making real human-to-human contact requires honesty and a genuine interest in other people. Phil gives his reason why he and Larry have a friendship: trust. He then tells Bob that until he can recognize what he should regret, he will not grow in character. The next morning Phil packs his things. As Larry checks out, he sees Bob talking again to the \\"Big Kahuna\\" in the lobby. They exchange a knowing smile as Bob appears to continue to push his own agenda of preaching God instead of selling lubricants. The soundtrack during the credits is \\"Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen)\\", a setting of an essay by Mary Schmich.

The Pirate Republic of Sal√©, in 17th century Morocco, was a micronation with its own seaport argot known as \\"Franco,\\" since like other pirate states, it from time to time made treaties with European governments, agreeing not to attack their fleets. The United States Navy was founded, in part, to counter the activities of the Barbary pirates, and the United States fought the First and Second Barbary Wars (1801‚Äì1805, 1815) to end this threat to its shipping. Some pirate havens were supposed to have formed anarchist societies called pirate utopias. On the Somali Coast In the early 2000s piracy became common place off the coast of Somalia. During this period, pirate havens included Eyl, in the Puntland region of northern Somalia, and Harardhere (Xarard-heere), in the Mudug province of Somalia. During the same time period Transitional Federal Government of Somalia was believed to unable to enforce maritime laws. Other modern havens included Garaad and Hobyo in central Somalia.http://www.tiede.fi, the Finnish science magazine Tiede, no 5/2011 List of examples *Barataria Bay in the United States *Campeche in Mexico *Porto Farina in Tunis *Harardhere in Somalia *Libertatia in Madagascar *Matanzas in Cuba *New Providence (Republic of Pirates) in the Bahamas *Port Royal in Jamaica *Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands *Tortuga in Haiti *Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands See also *Tax haven References *Peter Lamborn Wilson, Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs & European Renegadoes (Autonomedia, 1996) *Peter Ludlow, Crypto Anarchy, Cyberstates, and Pirate Utopias (2001) *Hakim Bey, TAZ - The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (Autonomedia, 2003) *Hannu Pesonen, Somalian merirosvot kukistuvat kuten kaikki edelt√§j√§ns√§ Tiede (Finnish science magazine) no. 5/2011, pp. 44‚Äì49 (Sanoma magazines, 2011) External links *Pirate Utopias - From \\"Temporary Autonomous Zone\\" Utopias Barbary Wars Political philosophy Social philosophy es:Utop√≠a pirata ","title":"Pirate haven"},{"id":"625717","text":"Story of the Year is an American rock band formed in St. Louis, Missouri,[ Story of the Year at Allmusic.com] Accessed May 17, 2007. in 1995 under the name 67 North. The band eventually changed their name to Big Blue Monkey in 1998, and then subsequently changed it again to Story of the Year in 2002 after the release of their EP titled Story of the Year on the indie label Criterion Records, after they realized a blues group of the name Big Blue Monkey had already existed. It would not be until three years after forming that Story of the Year saw its first piece of commercial success in its major label debut, Page Avenue, containing the popular singles \\"Until the Day I Die\\" and \\"Anthem of Our Dying Day\\". A second album, In the Wake of Determination, followed in 2005, but did not achieve the commercial success of its predecessor. The band released their third album, The Black Swan, on April 22, 2008, which was their first release on Epitaph Records, followed by 2010's The Constant. On August 11, 2017, Story of the Year teased a 90-second clip of a new song off their crowd-funded fifth studio album. The pledge campaign began in November 2016 and was completely funded in less than 3 days. The band used high-profile producer Aaron Sprinkle and mixers Tom Lord Alge & J Hall to complete their fifth studio album. They confirmed via the pledge site that the new album will be titled Wolves, which was released on PledgeMusic on December 1, 2017. The album's wide release was on December 8, 2017. On February 2, 2019 Story of the year had their annual hometown show at the Pageant in St. Louis. Missouri for their new album Wolves. History=67 North & Big Blue Monkey (1995‚Äì2002)= The band were formed in 1995 under the name \\"67 North\\" by guitarist Ryan Phillips of the bands Means Well and Locash, drummer Dan Marsala, vocalist John Taylor and bassist Perry West. They changed their name to \\"Big Blue Monkey\\" in 1998 before releasing the first EP Three Days Broken that same year. In 1999, they released another EP called Truth in Separation, their last under the line-up. In 2000, West and Taylor would both depart from the group, leading to Marsala moving to vocal duties, and the recruitment of Means Well drummer Josh Wills as well as the members' long time friend Adam Russell on bass duties, despite him never having played bass prior (previously a guitarist prior to joining the band). It was at this point that the band relocated to Orange County, California, where the final Big Blue Monkey EP was released in 2002 titled Story of the Year, which they would then change their name to later that year. =Page Avenue (2002‚Äì2004)= After spending many years as a local band with different line-ups, recording three EPs and multiple demos, Story of the Year signed a deal with Maverick Records in 2002, then recorded and released their first album, Page Avenue, in September 2003. The first single from that album was \\"Until The Day I Die\\". It first received radio airplay around July‚ÄìAugust 2003 on stations like KPNT. The second single, \\"Anthem of Our Dying Day\\", featured a music video directed by Joe Hahn of Linkin Park. MTV News reported on their website that during a radio show in May 2004, the band members of Story of the Year got into a fight with the roadies of metal band Godsmack.Story of the Year Say Godsmack's Crew Kicked Their Asses. MTV News, June 2, 2004 Accessed February 6, 2007 Pictures of the band members' bruised faces were posted on their homepage. The members of Godsmack were not involved in the fight. Live in the Lou/Bassassins (a CD/DVD combo of live performances and touring video) was released on May 10, 2005. It was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 2005, indicating shipment of over 50,000 units as it is video longform format.Gold and Platinum Database Search Type in \\"Story of the Year\\" =In the Wake of Determination (2004‚Äì2006)= After the Page Avenue tour ended in late 2004, Story of the Year returned to the studio with producer Steve Evetts in 2005, to record their second studio album. In the Wake of Determination, released on October 11, 2005, is much heavier sounding than the previous album. As of March 2006, that album had only sold 150,698 units and has failed to achieve the gold certification that the band's two previous releases had, per the RIAA website. Although not as successful as its predecessor, the album debuted at No. 19 on the Billboard 200. =The Black Swan (2007‚Äì2009)= Story of the Year released The Black Swan in 2008. For the album, they brought back producer John Feldmann and Elvis Baskette. The album received praise from music critics and achieved decent commercial success, more so than the previous album.

For the recording of The Black Swan, Story of the Year decided to end their five-year relationship with Maverick and signed with Epitaph Records. Story of the Year played on 2008's Taste of Chaos International tour with Atreyu. =The Constant (2009‚Äì2010)= In May 2009, Story of the Year began work on another album.

It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems. Unlike Windows, Mac OS, Unix, or Unix-like systems which are primarily written in the C programming language, JavaOS is primarily written in Java. It is now considered a legacy system.  History  The Java programming language was introduced by Sun in May 1995. Across the following six months, the Java platform and its ideas propagated through the world. Jim Mitchell and Peter Madany at JavaSoft designed a new operating system, codenamed Kona, written completely in Java. In March 1996, Tom Saulpaugh joined the now seven-person Kona team to design an I/O architecture, having come from Apple as Mac OS engineer since June 1985 and co-architect of Copland. JavaOS was first evangelized in a Byte article. In 1996, JavaSoft's official product announcement described the compact OS designed to run \\"in anything from net computers to pagers\\". In early 1997, JavaSoft transferred JavaOS to SunSoft. In late 1997, Bob Rodriguez led the team to collaborate with IBM who then marketed the platform, accelerated development, and made significant key architectural contributions to the next release of JavaOS, eventually renamed JavaOS for Business. IBM indicated its focus was more on network computer thin clients, specifically to replace traditional \\"green screen\\" and UNIX terminals, and to implement single application clients. The Chorus distributed real-time operating system was purchased for its microkernel technology. JavaSoft has granted licenses to more than 25 manufacturers, including Oracle Corp, Acer Inc., Xerox, Toshiba Corp, and Nokia. IBM and Sun announced the cooperation for JavaOS for Business at the end of March 1998. In 1999, Sun and IBM announced the discontinuation of the JavaOS product. As early as 2003, Sun materials referred to JavaOS as a \\"legacy technology\\", recommending migration to Java ME, leaving the choice of specific OS and Java environment to the implementer.  Overview  JavaOS is based on a hardware architecture native microkernel, running on platforms including ARM, PowerPC, SPARC, StrongARM, and IA-32 (x86). The Java virtual machine runs on top of the microkernel. All device drivers are written in Java and executed by the virtual machine. A graphics and windowing system implementing the AWT API is also written in Java. JavaOS was designed to run on embedded systems and has applications in devices such as set-top boxes, networking infrastructure, and ATMs. It comes with the JavaStation.

Comics Born in Brookline, Massachusetts, McManus entered the comics field in the early 1980s with work for Heavy Metal and DC Comics. For the June 1983 issue of Heavy Metal he collaborated with Bhob Stewart and John Coffey on \\"Zenobia\\". Six months later, McManus and Stewart teamed with Jim McDermott on \\"Symbiosis\\", also in Heavy Metal (December 1983). He drew the Green Arrow backup feature in Detective Comics in 1983-1984. McManus gained wider attention when he illustrated two issues of The Saga of the Swamp Thing written by Alan Moore. McManus worked with writer Todd Klein on Omega Men, creating Zirral and other characters for that series. He has drawn issues of Doctor Fate and Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight. He collaborated with Neil Gaiman on the \\"Fables & Reflections\\" and \\"A Game of You\\" story arcs in The Sandman. McManus' other Sandman credits include The Sandman Presents: Taller Tales and a pair of limited series about the witch Thessaly written by Bill Willingham. McManus' artwork for Marvel Comics includes Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual '97 and Daredevil #351. In an interview, John Rozum, who scripted that issue of Daredevil, recalled: :I thought Shawn McManus's art was great. I'd like to work with him again sometime, though we didn't really work together here. At the time I wrote it, I had no idea who'd be drawing it. Shawn and I have never even met or spoken with each other. I always write full script though, and unlike some other artists, Shawn actually pays attention to the script. I think his artwork was a nice pairing with the story. McManus has contributed to titles from a variety of other publishers, including Atomeka Press (A1), Dark Horse Comics (Cheval Noir), Exhibit A Press (Wolff & Byrd: Counselors of the Macabre), First Comics (Grimjack), Image Comics (Supreme), Malibu Comics (The Man Called A-X), and DC Comics' Paradox Press (The Big Book Of Freaks). He worked on Leah Moore and John Reppion's Wild Girl (Wildstorm, 2004‚Äì2005) with J. H. Williams III, about 13-year-old Rosa Torez who discovers that she can communicate with animals. In 2007, he did an eight-issue run on Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis and an issue of The Creeper for DC. He illustrated Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love in 2010 and Cinderella: Fables Are Forever the following year. He was one of several artists to contribute to the Fairest in All the Land graphic novel. Children's art Writer-illustrator and lecturer Mark McKenna, creator of the Banana Tail children's book series, described his long association with McManus that led to their Banana Tail: The Early Years (2009) color print: :I met Shawn McManus in the DC Comics offices back in late 1985. I was up at DC Comics to meet with an editor or show samples, I forget, the old brain is failing me here. But I do recall Shawn sitting in with the editor who I was about to have a meeting with. At the time, Shawn was drawing Swamp Thing, and I was delighted to see his lively, bouncy and very refreshing art style. Little did I know that within a year we would be an art team along with writer J. M. DeMatteis on DC's Doctor Fate series... We worked together for six months on Doctor Fate until the DC editor moved me to another book. I haven't had any creative contact with Shawn since that time in 1987. We really never spoke during the time we worked together. I was still very new to the business and didn't think to call and collaborate with Shawn to get his sensibilities about direction and vision for the book. No contact with Shawn until a few brief comic con \\"how ya doing's?\\", and an eventual reconnect through our mutual art rep, Bob Shaw... Bob had this idea that Shawn should work with me and create some ultra cool Banana Tail painting... Seeing Bob Shaw's excitement, Shawn then saw the potential in Banana Tail. Television In 1987, McManus worked on the animated series Dinosaucers. For the TV series Tales from the Crypt, McManus and Mike Vosburg illustrated comic book covers designed to look like the original 1950s comics. The McManus Crypt cover is seen in the first episode (\\"The Man Who Was Death\\"). Awards 1985 Jack Kirby Award nomination with Alan Moore for Best Single Issue (\\"Pog\\" in The Saga of the Swamp Thing #32).

He was the son and successor to Hiempsal II.  Biography  Juba I's bust Coin portraying Juba I In 81 BC Hiempsal had been driven from his throne; soon afterwards, Pompey was sent to Africa by Sulla to reinstate him as king in Numidia, and because of this Hiempsal and later Juba became Pompey's allies. This alliance was strengthened during a visit by Juba to Rome, when Julius Caesar insulted him by pulling on his beard during a trial when Caesar was defending his client against Juba's father, and still further in 50 BC, when the tribune Gaius Scribonius Curio openly proposed that Numidia should be sold privately. In August 49 BC, Caesar sent Curio to take Africa from the Republicans. Curio was overconfident and held Publius Attius Varus (Varus), the governor of Africa, in low esteem. Curio took fewer legions than he had been given. In the Battle of the Bagradas the same year, Curio led his army in a bold, uphill attack which swiftly routed Varus's army and wounded Varus. Encouraged by this success, Curio acted on what proved to be faulty intelligence, and attacked what he believed to be a detachment of Juba's army. In fact, the bulk of the king's forces were there and, after an initial success, Curio's forces were ambushed and virtually annihilated by Saburra (Juba's military commander). Curio was surrounded with the remnants of his troops on a hilltop and died in the fighting. Only a few escaped on their ships, and King Juba took several senators captive back to Numidia for display and execution. With the arrival of Caesar in Africa, Juba originally planned to join Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica, but his kingdom was invaded from the west by Caesar's ally Bocchus II and an Italian adventurer, Publius Sittius. He therefore left only 30 elephants behind and marched home to save his country. Scipio knew he could not fight without more troops, and sent a desperate message to Juba for assistance. Juba immediately left the command of his kingdom's defence with Saburra, and joined Scipio with three legions, around 15,000 light infantry, 1000 cavalry and 30 elephants for the Battle of Thapsus. However, he camped away from Scipio's main lines. Seeing the certain defeat of Scipio's army, Juba did not take part in the battle and fled with his 30,000 men. Having fled with the Roman general Marcus Petreius and finding their retreat cut off, they made a suicide pact and engaged in one on one combat. The idea was that one would meet an honourable death. Sources vary on the outcome, but it is most likely that Petreius killed Juba and then committed suicide with the assistance of a slave.  Family  Juba I was the father of King of Numidia and later Mauretania, Juba II (50/52 BC ‚Äì AD 23), father-in-law of Juba II‚Äôs wives Greek Ptolemaic princess Cleopatra Selene II (40 BC ‚Äì 6 BC), Cappadocian princess Glaphyra and paternal grandfather to King Ptolemy of Mauretania (1 BC ‚Äì 40 AD) and the princess Drusilla of Mauretania the Elder (born 5 AD).

The conspiracy may have been instigated by members in the Congress of the Confederation, who circulated an anonymous letter in the army camp at Newburgh, New York, on March 10, 1783. Soldiers were unhappy that they had not been paid for some time and that pensions that had been promised remained unfunded. The letter suggested that they should take unspecified action against Congress to resolve the issue. The letter was said to have been written by Major John Armstrong, aide to General Horatio Gates, although the authorship of its text and underlying ideas is a subject of historical debate. Commander-in-Chief George Washington stopped any serious talk of rebellion when he successfully appealed on March 15 in an emotional address to his officers asking them to support the supremacy of Congress. Not long afterward, Congress approved a compromise agreement it had previously rejected: it funded some of the pay arrears, and granted soldiers five years of full pay instead of a lifetime pension of half pay. The motivations of numerous actors in these events are the subject of debate. Some historians allege that serious consideration was given within the army to some sort of coup d'√©tat, while others dispute the notion. The exact motivations of congressmen involved in communications with army officers implicated in the events are similarly debated. Background After the British loss at the Siege of Yorktown in October 1781, the American Revolutionary War died down in North America, and peace talks began between British and American diplomats. The American Continental Army, based at Newburgh, New York, monitored British-occupied New York City. With the end of the war and dissolution of the Continental Army approaching, soldiers who had long been unpaid feared that the Confederation Congress would not meet previous promises concerning back pay and pensions. General Alexander McDougall Congress had in 1780 promised Continental officers a lifetime pension of half their pay when they were discharged.Kohn, Inside History, p 189 Financier Robert Morris had in early 1782 stopped army pay as a cost-saving measure, arguing that when the war finally ended the arrears would be made up.Rappleye, p 288 Throughout 1782 these issues were a regular topic of debate in Congress and in the army camp at Newburgh, and numerous memos and petitions by individual soldiers had failed to significantly affect Congressional debate on the subject.Kohn, Inside History, p 190 A number of officers organized under the leadership of General Henry Knox and drafted a memorandum to Congress. Signed by enough general officers that it could not be readily dismissed as the work of a few malcontents,Rappleye, pp 332‚Äì333 the memo was delivered to Congress by a delegation consisting of General Alexander McDougall and Colonels John Brooks and Matthias Ogden in late December 1782. It expressed unhappiness over pay that was months in arrears, and concern over the possibility that the half pay pension would not be forthcoming. In the memo they offered to accept a lump sum payment instead of the lifetime half pay pension. It also contained the vague threat that \\"any further experiments on their [the army's] patience may have fatal effects.\\" The seriousness of the situation was also communicated to Congress by Secretary at War Benjamin Lincoln. Actions of Congress Congress was politically divided on the subject of finance. The treasury was empty, and Congress lacked the power to compel the states to provide the necessary funds for meeting its obligations.Fleming, pp 250‚Äì252, 262 An attempt to amend the Articles of Confederation to allow Congress to impose an import tariff known as an \\"impost\\" was decisively defeated by the states in November 1782,Kohn, Inside History, p 191 and some states had enacted legislation forbidding their representatives from supporting any sort of lifetime pension.Kohn, Inside History, p 195 Members of the \\"nationalist\\" faction in Congress who had supported the tax proposal (including Robert Morris, Gouverneur Morris, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton) believed that the army funding issues could be used as a lever to gain for Congress the ability to raise its own revenue.Kohn, Inside History, pp 191‚Äì193Fleming, p 261 Gouverneur Morris (left) and Robert Morris (right), portrait by Charles Willson Peale, 1783 The army delegation first met with Robert Morris and other nationalists. The politicians convinced McDougall that it was imperative for the army to remain cooperative while they sought funding. The hope they expressed was to tie the army's demands to those of the government's other creditors to force opposing Congressmen to act.Kohn, Inside History, p 192 On January 6 Congress established a committee to address the army's memo. It first met with Robert Morris, who stated that there were no funds to meet the army's demands, and that loans for government operations would require evidence of a revenue stream.Kohn, Inside History, pp 193‚Äì194 When it met with McDougall on January 13, the general painted a stark picture of the discontent at Newburgh; Colonel Brooks opined that \\"a disappointment might throw [the army] into blind extremities.\\"Kohn, Inside History, p 194 When Congress met on January 22 to debate the committee's report, Robert Morris shocked the body by tendering his resignation, heightening tension. The Congressional leadership immediately moved to keep Morris's resignation secret.Fleming, p 263 Debate on a funding scheme turned in part on the issue of the pension. Twice the nationalists urged the body to adopt a commuted pension scheme (one that would end after a fixed time, rather than lifetime), but it was rejected both times. After the second rejection on February 4, a plot to further raise tensions began to take shape. Four days later, Colonel Brooks was dispatched back to Newburgh with instructions to gain the army leadership's agreement with the proposed nationalist plan. The army leadership was also urged by Gouverneur Morris to use its influence with state legislatures to secure their approval for needed changes. On February 12, McDougall sent a letter (signed with the pseudonym Brutus) to General Knox suggesting that the army might have to mutiny by refusing to disband until it was paid. He specifically told Knox to not make any direct steps, but that he should \\"not lose a moment preparing for events.\\"Kohn, Inside History, p 196 Historian Richard Kohn is of the opinion that the purpose of these communications was not to foment a coup or military action against Congress or the states, but to use the specter of a recalcitrant army's refusal to disband as a political weapon against the antinationalists. The nationalists were also aware of a significant cadre of lower-level officers who were unhappy with General Washington's leadership and had gravitated to the camp of Major General Horatio Gates, a longtime Washington rival. These officers, Kohn believes, could be used by the nationalists to stage something that resembled a coup if necessary.Kohn, Inside History, pp 198‚Äì199 Colonel John Brooks, 1820 portrait by Gilbert Stuart The arrival on February 13 of rumors that a preliminary peace agreement had been reached in Paris heightened the sense of urgency among the nationalists.Kohn, Inside History, p 201 Alexander Hamilton wrote a letter to General Washington the same day, essentially warning him of the possibility of impending unrest among the ranks, and urging him to \\"take the direction\\" of the army's anger.Kohn, Inside History, p 202 Washington responded that he sympathized both with the plight of his officers and men and with those in Congress, but that he would not use the army to threaten the civil government. Washington believed such a course of action would violate the principles of republicanism for which they had all been fighting.Fleming, p 266 It was unclear to the Congressional nationalists whether Knox, who had been a regular supporter of army protests to Congress, would play a role in any sort of staged action. In letters written February 21, Knox unambiguously indicated he would play no such part, expressing the hope that the army's force would only be used against \\"the Enemies of the liberties in America.\\"Kohn, Inside History, p 203 On February 25 and 26 there was a flurry of activity in Philadelphia, which may have been occasioned by the arrival of Knox's letters. The nationalists had had little success in advancing their program through Congress, and continued to use rhetoric repeating concerns over the army's stability.Kohn, Inside History, p 204 On March 8 Pennsylvania Colonel Walter Stewart arrived at Newburgh. Stewart was known to Robert Morris; the two had previous dealings when Stewart proposed coordinating activities of private creditors of the government,Rappleye, p 302 and he was aware of the poor state of affairs in Philadelphia.Fleming, p 267 His movement to Newburgh had been ordered by Washington (he was returning to duty after recovering from an illness) and would not necessarily draw notice. Although his movements at camp are not known in detail, it appears likely that he met with General Gates not long after his arrival. Within hours rumors began flying around the Newburgh camp that the army would refuse to disband until its demands were met.Kohn, Inside History, p 206 Call for meeting On the morning of March 10 an unsigned letter began circulating in the army camp. Later acknowledged to be written by Major John Armstrong, Jr., aide to General Gates, the letter decried the army's condition and the lack of Congressional support, and called upon the army to send Congress an ultimatum. Published at the same time was an anonymous call for a meeting of all field officers for 11 a.m. the next day. The Newburgh Address. Washington reacted with dispatch. On the morning of the 11th in his general orders he objected to the \\"disorderly\\" and \\"irregular\\" nature of the anonymously called meeting, and announced that there would be a meeting of officers on the 15th instead. This meeting, he said, would be presided over by the senior officer present, and Washington requested a report of the meeting, implying that he would not attend. On the morning of the 12th a second unsigned letter appeared, claiming Washington's agreement to a meeting as an endorsement of the conspirators' position.Kohn, Inside History, p 208 Washington, who had initially thought the first letter to be the work of individuals outside the camp (specifically citing Gouverneur Morris as a likely candidate), was compelled to admit this unlikely given the speed at which the second letter appeared.Skeen and Kohn, pp 286‚Äì287 The March 15 meeting was held in the \\"New Building\\" or \\"Temple\\", a 40 by 70-foot (12 by 21 m) building at the camp. After Gates opened the meeting, Washington entered the building to everyone's surprise. He asked to speak to the officers, and the stunned Gates relinquished the floor. Washington could tell by the faces of his officers, who had not been paid for quite some time, that they were quite angry and did not show the respect or deference as they had toward Washington in the past.Fleming, pp 269‚Äì270 Washington then gave a short but impassioned speech, now known as the Newburgh Address, counseling patience. His message was that they should oppose anyone \\"who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood.\\"Chernow, ch 35 at note 56 He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers. He gazed upon it and fumbled with it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them.Hubbard, Robert Ernest. General Rufus Putnam: George Washington's Chief Military Engineer and the \\"Father of Ohio,\\" p. 88, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina. . He then said: This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a great deal for the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years. Many of those present were moved to tears, and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter. He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty. Knox and Colonel Brooks were then appointed to a committee to draft a suitable resolution. Approved by virtually the entire assembly, the resolution expressed \\"unshaken confidence\\" in Congress, and \\"disdain\\" and \\"abhorrence\\" for the irregular proposals published earlier in the week.Kohn, Inside History, p 211 Historian Richard Kohn believes the entire meeting was carefully stage-managed by Washington, Knox, and their supporters. The only voice raised in opposition was that of Colonel Timothy Pickering, who criticized members of the assembly for hypocritically condemning the anonymous addresses that only days before they had been praising.Fleming, p 272 Aftermath General Washington had sent copies of the anonymous addresses to Congress. This \\"alarming intelligence\\" (as James Madison termed it) arrived while Congress was debating the pension issues. Nationalist leaders orchestrated the creation of a committee to respond to the news, which was deliberately populated with members opposed to any sort of pension payment. The pressure worked on Connecticut representative Eliphalet Dyer, one of the committee members, and he proposed approval of a lump sum payment on March 20. The final agreement was for a five years' full pay instead of the lifetime half pay pension scheme originally promised.Fleming, pp 272‚Äì273 They received government bonds which at the time were highly speculative, but were in fact redeemed 100 cents on the dollar (i.e., at full value) by the new government in 1790.Kohn, Eagle and Sword, p 33 John Armstrong, the author of the Newburgh letters The soldiers continued to grumble, with the unrest spreading to the noncommissioned officers (sergeants and corporals). Riots occurred and mutiny threatened. Washington rejected suggestions that the army stay in operation until the states found the money for the pay. On April 19, 1783, his General Orders of the day announced the end of hostilities against Great Britain. Congress thereafter ordered him to disband the army, since everyone agreed that a large army of 10,000 men was no longer needed, and the men were eager to go home. Congress gave each soldier three months pay, but since they had no funds Robert Morris issued $800,000 in personal notes to the soldiers. Many soldiers sold these notes to speculators, some even before they left camp, in order to be able to make their way home.Fleming, p 288 Over the next several months, much of the Continental Army was furloughed, although many of the rank and file realized it was effectively a disbandment. The army was formally disbanded in November 1783, leaving only a small force at West Point and several scattered frontier outposts.Merrill Jensen, The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation 1781‚Äì1789 (1950) pp 54‚Äì84 Discontent related to pay had resurfaced in Philadelphia in June 1783. Due in part to a critical miscommunication, troops in eastern Pennsylvania were led to believe that they would be discharged even before Morris' promissory notes would be distributed, and they marched to the city in protest. Pennsylvania President John Dickinson refused to call out the militia (reasoning they might actually support the mutineers), and Congress decided to relocate to Princeton, New Jersey. There is circumstantial evidence that several participants in the Newburgh affair (notably Walter Stewart, John Armstrong, and Gouverneur Morris) may have played a role in this uprising as well. The main long-term result of the Newburgh affair was a strong reaffirmation of the principle of civilian control of the military, and banishing any possibility of a coup as outside the realm of republican values. It also validated Washington's stature as a leading proponent of civilian control.Kohn, Eagle and Sword pp 34‚Äì39 Historical analysis Historian Richard Kohn writes that a number of key details about the individuals and their motivations are not known, and probably never will be. For example, it is unclear exactly how much Colonels Brooks and Stewart, the principal messengers in the affair, knew.Kohn, Inside History, p 220 The intent of the Gates group has been the subject of some debate: Kohn argues that they were intent on organizing some form of direct action (although he disclaims the idea that this would necessarily take the form of a traditional coup d'√©tat), while historian Paul David Nelson claims Kohn's thesis is circumstantial and poorly supported by primary materials.Nelson and Kohn, pp 145‚Äì150 A letter written by General Gates in June 1783 illustrates the disagreement: in the letter Gates writes that the purpose of the events was to pressure Congress. Kohn argues that Gates is writing after the fact to cover his tracks, while Nelson claims Gates is giving a candid account of the affair.Nelson and Kohn, pp 149‚Äì150 Historian C. Edward Skeen writes that Kohn's case is weak because it relies heavily on interpretation of written statements and is not well supported by the actions of the alleged conspirators. He notes, for example, that there is ample evidence suggesting mutinous sentiments were not obviously circulating in the Newburgh camp between the arrivals of Brooks and Stewart;Skeen and Kohn, p 279 Kohn counters that the relative quiet in camp masked significant undercurrents of unhappiness.Skeen and Kohn, p 292 David Cobb, who served on Washington's staff during the affair, wrote in 1825, \\"I have ever considered that the United States are indebted for their republican form of government solely to the firm and determined republicanism of George Washington at this time.\\"Skeen and Kohn, p 288 Skeen notes that the event has served to significantly burnish Washington's reputation.

It is part of the state-owned France T√©l√©visions group, along with France 3, France 4, and France 5. France T√©l√©visions also participates in ARTE and EuroNews. Since 3:20 CET on 7 April 2008, all France 2 programming has been broadcast in 16:9 widescreen formatFrance 2 goes 16:9 widescreen : Broadband TV News over the French analogue and digital terrestrial television. An HD simulcast feed of France 2 has been broadcasting on satellite provider CanalSat since 1 July 2008 and on digital terrestrial television since 30 October 2008.France 2 HD launches on CanalSat : Broadband TV News History Originally under the ownership of the RTF, the channel went on the air for the first time on 18 April 1964 as RTF T√©l√©vision 2. Within a year, ORTF rebranded that channel as La deuxi√®me cha√Æne (The Second Channel). Originally, the network was broadcast on 625-line transmitters only in preparation for the discontinuation of 819-line black & white transmissions and the introduction of colour. The switch to colour occurred at 14:15 CET on 1 October 1967, using the SECAM system. La deuxi√®me cha√Æne became the first colour television channel in France although TF1 would not commence colour broadcasting on 625-lines until 1 September 1975. Such technology later allowed the network to air programming in NICAM stereo (compatible with SECAM). The present channel is the direct successor of Antenne 2, established under a 1974 law that mandated the breakup of ORTF into seven distinct organisations. Three television \\"programme corporations\\" were established on 6 January 1975 ‚Äì TF1, Antenne 2 and FR3, now France 3 ‚Äì alongside Radio France, the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de production, the public broadcasting agency T√©l√©diffusion de France and the Institut national de l'audiovisuel (INA). Antenne 2 and the other corporations were constituted as limited companies with the state controlling 100% of their capital. Although the three channels were set up as competitors vying for advertisers, they retained a collective monopoly over television broadcasting in France that was not repealed until 1981. Privately owned channels such as Canal+ and La Cinq (now superseded by France 5) soon became major competitors to the state-owned channels after the state monopoly was lifted.Rigourd, Serge. \\"France\\", in Western Broadcasting at the Dawn of the 21st Century, pp. 255, 270. Eds. Haenens, Leen; Saeys, Frieda. Walter de Gruyter, 2001. The breakup of ORTF had been intended to stimulate competition between the public channels but failed in this aim; both TF1 and Antenne 2 came to rely on a diet of popular entertainment shows alongside cheap American imports, seeking to maximise ratings and attract advertisers.Looseley, David. Popular Music in Contemporary France: Authenticity, Politics, Debate, p. 122. Berg Publishers, 2003. TF1 was privatised in 1987, radically affecting the balance of the French television market. The remaining state-owned channels came under severe pressure from their private competitors and lost 30% of their market share between 1987 and 1989.Rollet, Brigitte. \\"Television in France\\", in Television in Europe, pp. 39‚Äì40. Eds. Coleman, James A.; Rollet, Brigitte. Intellect Books, 1997. In an effort to save them, a single director-general was appointed to manage both Antenne 2 and FR3 and the two channels merged to form the France T√©l√©visions group. They were renamed on 7 September 1992 as France 2 and France 3 respectively.Hart, Jeffrey A. Technology, Television, and Competition: The Politics of Digital TV, p. 46. Cambridge University Press, 2004. By 1995, the combined audience share of the two state-owned channels was 41%, with France 2 in particular being heavily dependent on advertising and sponsorship revenues, which comprised 43.8% of its budget by 1996. The focus on ratings led to strong rivalry with TF1, for instance prompting the two channels to broadcast popular shows and news programmes in the same timeslots. TF1 and France 2 compete for the same demographics; dramas (including American imports), game shows and light entertainments form the dominant mix on both channels.Scriven, Michael; Lecomte, Monia.

Since 11 December 2006, France 2 was again made available across Italy on Digital terrestrial television until 7 June 2007, when it was replaced by all-news French TV network France 24. France 2 is now only available in Aosta Valley due to Italian self-government laws, and in the border zones because of natural spillover. Controversy=Lebanese Civil War kidnapping of Antenne 2 news team= In March 1986, an Antenne 2 news team was kidnapped in Beirut while reporting on the Lebanese Civil War. Philippe Rochot, Georges Hansen, Aurel Corn√©a and Jean-Louis Normandin were four of many Western hostages held by terrorists during the conflict. During the opening sequences of Antenne 2 news bulletins, the headlines would be followed by a reminder of the French hostages held in Lebanon, including others such as Michel Seurat and Jean-Paul Kaufman, with names, photos and the length of their captivity. Within a year, most of the news team had been released and returned to France, but the reminders continued until all the hostages had been freed. =Muhammad al-Durrah shooting= On 30 September 2000, France 2 aired the famous footage of the shooting of Muhammad al-Durrah in the Gaza Strip. The scene was filmed by a Palestinian journalist, Talal Abu Rahma, who worked for the station.The Rory Peck Trust: Awards 2001 The voiceover, blaming the killing on fire from the Israeli Defence Forces, was provided by the channel's reporter Charles Enderlin. Subsequently, that account was put in doubt, with others suggesting that the fatal shots could not have come from the IDF position.Who Shot Mohammed al-Dura? France 2 later launched libel actions against commentators who alleged that the incident was staged.

On 7 March 2013, France 2 aired an eight-minute investigative report purporting to expose a weapons smuggling channel from Serbia to France. The report authors, journalists Franck Genauzeau and R√©gis Math√©, traveled to Serbia in February 2013 where they filmed a story claiming that Serbia is a hub for international weapons smuggling. Among its footage, the report showed two masked men ‚Äì identified as Serbian weapons smugglers ‚Äì who talked about their supposed illegal activity while showing off some of the weaponry: in particular two hand guns and one AK-47 Kalashnikov. They're also shown firing off rounds in the woods.Sur la piste des trafiquants de kalachnikovs, de la Serbie √† la France;France 2, 8 March 2013 After the report aired, the Serbian police's criminal department (UKP) conducted a month-long investigation, revealing its findings in May 2013 that parts of the French news story were staged with full knowledge of the two France 2 journalists.Name≈°tena reporta≈æa: Francuska nacionalna televizija izmislila da je Srbija centar ≈°verca oru≈æja;Blic, 26 May 2013 According to the police report, Genauzeau and Math√© arrived in Belgrade where they hired a local media fixer named Aleksandar M. who was employed at a Serbian news agency, giving him the task of finding weapons smugglers willing to go before a camera. Aleksandar M. apparently contacted his cousin Nenad Mirkoviƒá and told him that the French were willing to pay ‚Ç¨800 for weapons smugglers. At this point Mirkoviƒá decided that he himself will appear on camera and also contacted his friend ≈Ωarko Blagojeviƒá to do the same. In order to make their act more credible, they then obtained two handguns ‚Äì Zastava 9mm and 7.56mm ‚Äì from Blagojeviƒá's father-in-law and father respectively. They also decided to get an automatic weapon by buying it from certain Milorad Novakoviƒá, a resident of Umka. Apparently, the two first offered him ‚Ç¨200, but Novakoviƒá wanted ‚Ç¨350, at which point they went back to two French journalists asking for more money and getting it. Coached by Genauzeau and Math√©, the footage featuring masked Blagojeviƒá and Mirkoviƒá was shot at a house owned by Blagojeviƒá's friend in Umka. Afterwards, they went into the nearby woods in Duboko near Umka where they fired off a few rounds for the cameras. They then returned the two handguns to Blagojeviƒá's father and father in law before selling the Kalashnikov for ‚Ç¨100. According to the Serbian police report, Aleksandar M. was paid ‚Ç¨300 by the French journalists while Mirkoviƒá and Blagojeviƒá split the ‚Ç¨800 between themselves. Serbian foreign minister Ivan Mrkiƒá reacted to the police report by \\"seeking explanations from France as the ministry looks to make sure the untruths from the report are clarified\\".French national TV fabricates story about weapons smuggling;B92, 27 May 2013  References  External links   France T√©l√©visions Corporate site 02 Television channels and stations established in 1964 French- language television stations Television stations in France ","title":"France 2"},{"id":"625808","text":"Chadlington is a village and civil parish in the Evenlode Valley about south of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.

Churches and chapel=Church of England= The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas was originally Norman, and the blocked head of a Norman window above the north arcade show that the building had a clerestory in Norman times. In the 13th century Early English Gothic north and south aisles were added, with four-bay arcades linking the aisles with the nave. Both aisles still retain some lancet windows from this period. The bell tower was built early in the 14th century in the Decorated Gothic style. A chapel was added at the east end of the north aisle. The chapel's east and north windows in the Transitional style between Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic date it to of the chancel about the middle of the 14th century. Later pure Perpendicular Gothic additions include the windows and north door in the north aisle, the present clerestory and nave roof and the chancel arch. In 1870 the Gothic Revival architect Charles Buckeridge completely rebuilt the chancel. St. Nicholas' church is a Grade II* listed building. The tower has a ring of six bells.

Records). History=Beginnings= The label was founded in 1966 as Sire Productions by Seymour Stein and Richard Gottehrer, each investing ten thousand dollars into the new company. Its early releases, in 1968, were distributed by London Records. From the beginning, Sire introduced underground, progressive British bands to the American market. Early releases included the Climax Blues Band, Barclay James Harvest, Tomorrow, Matthews Southern Comfort and proto-punks The Deviants. When distribution by London Records ended after two years, distribution was handled by various companies: Polydor Records in 1970 and 1971, during which time Sire's famous logo was introduced; by Famous Music from 1972 to 1974, during which time the progressive rock band Focus charted with their 1972 hit \\"Hocus Pocus\\"; and by ABC Records in the U.S., which inherited Sire's distribution deal when it acquired Famous Music; and Phonogram Inc. in Europe from 1974 to 1977. In the 70s, Sire released a number of compilation albums, including the 3 volume \\"History Of British Rock\\" series, and acts such as Renaissance, The Turtles, Duane Eddy, the Small Faces, and Del Shannon. The UK signing policy was vindicated when Climax Blues Band scored a Top 40 hit in 1977 with \\"Couldn't Get It Right\\". Also in 1977, Stein, who had previously worked with the Shangri-Las in the 1960s, convinced the group to reform and return to the studio. But the trio working together again proved to be short-lived and they asked to be let out of their contract; the new songs they had recorded were not released by the label. =Acquisition by Warner= In the mid-1970s, Sire transformed itself into a successful independent record label and went on to sign artists from the burgeoning punk rock and new wave scenes, including the Ramones, the Dead Boys, the Undertones, and the Talking Heads. Sire returned to major label distribution in 1977 with a new deal with Warner Bros. Records. The following year Warner Bros. and Sire entered negotiations whereas Warner Bros. would purchase Sire Records outright, making Sire one of Warner Bros. subsidiary labels. Over the next several years, Sire saw success with the signings and releases of acts such as the Pretenders, Madonna (their biggest act), Soft Cell, the Cure, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, and Echo & the Bunnymen to North America. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the label had continued success with a roster that included Ministry, k.d. lang, Ice-T, Seal, and Tommy Page. In 1994, Sire switched distribution from Warner Bros. Records to sister label Elektra Records, also part of parent company Warner Music Group (WMG). Stein had been appointed president of Elektra Records under Elektra's newly appointed CEO Sylvia Rhone, so Stein would also be overseeing distribution of Sire releases by Elektra as well as running Elektra day-to-day. Sire left Elektra distribution in 1997 as it became a stand-alone label. But in 2000, Sire and the US division of London Records were merged to become one label, London-Sire Records. This partnership, however, was dissolved in April 2003, at which point the company went back to being called Sire Records, and it returned to distribution with Warner Bros. Records once again. In 1998, Sire signed a deal with the band The Tragically Hip to distribute their music outside of Canada. Currently, it signs newcomers, including the Ready Set and Lights. In 2009, official music videos displayed on the Sire Records website were taken down because of a copyright claim by parent Warner Music Group, after royalty negotiations between WMG and YouTube (which Sire had been using to host the videos) broke down in December 2008. In September 2009, both parties came to terms, with Warner Music restoring its music onto YouTube. In July 2017, Rani Hancock was named the new President of Sire Records. Label co-founder Seymour Stein remained on as Chairman. Hancock had previously been the Executive Vice President and Head of A&R; at Island Records. In July 2018, Stein departed from Sire Records after a total of 51 years involved at Sire or it's parent WMG.

A first refusal right must have at least three parties: the owner, the third party or buyer, and the option holder. In general, the owner must make the same offer to the option holder before making the offer to the buyer. The right of first refusal is similar in concept to a call option. An ROFR can cover almost any sort of asset, including real estate, personal property, a patent license, a screenplay, or an interest in a business. It might also cover business transactions that are not strictly assets, such as the right to enter a joint venture or distribution arrangement. In entertainment, a right of first refusal on a concept or a screenplay would give the holder the right to make that movie first while in real estate, a right of first refusal would create incentive for the tenant to take better care of their leased apartment in case the opportunity to purchase arises in the future. Only if the holder turns it down may the owner then shop it around to other parties. Because an ROFR is a contract right, the holder's remedies for breach are typically limited to recovery of damages. In other words, if the owner sells the asset to a third party without offering the holder the opportunity to purchase it first, the holder can then sue the owner for damages but may have a difficult time obtaining a court order to stop or reverse the sale. However, in some cases, the option becomes a property right that may be used to invalidate an improper sale. ROFR also arises in visitation agreements/orders in divorce cases. In such cases, an ROFR may require a custodial parent to offer parenting time to the non-custodial parent (rather than having a child supervised by a third party) any time that the custodial parent or his/her family is unable to exercise his/her right to parenting time (such as the custodial parent needs to travel out of town). Under these circumstances a breach may result in a finding of contempt and any remedies for contempt. An ROFR differs from a Right of First Offer (ROFO, also known as a Right of First Negotiation) in that the ROFO merely obliges the owner to undergo exclusive good faith negotiations with the rights holder before negotiating with other parties. A ROFR is an option to enter a transaction on exact or approximate transaction terms. A ROFO is merely an agreement to negotiate. Examples ROFR: Abe owns a house and Bo offers to buy that house for $1 million. However, Carl holds a right of first refusal to purchase the house. Therefore, before Abe can sell the house to Bo, he must first offer it to Carl for the $1 million that Bo is willing to buy it for. If Carl accepts, he buys the house instead of Bo. If Carl declines, Bo may now buy the house at the proposed $1 million price. ROFO: Carl holds a ROFO instead of an ROFR. Before Abe can negotiate a deal with Bo, he must first try to sell the house to Carl on whatever terms Abe is willing to sell. If they reach an agreement, Abe sells the house to Carl. However, if they fail, Abe is free to start fresh negotiations with Bo without any restriction as to price or terms. Variations The following are all variations on the basic ROFR: *Duration: The ROFR is limited in time. For example, Abe must make the offer to Carl for any proposed sale only in the first five years. After that, the right expires and Abe has no further obligation to Carl. *Exceptions include certain transactions. Abe may sell or transfer the property to a holding company, a trust, family members, etc. without first offering it to Carl. However, the new owners remain subject to the right. *Transferability: Carl may assign his ROFR to Dave. Abe must now offer Dave an option to purchase the property instead of Carl. Not every ROFR is transferable; some are personal to the original holder. *Extinguished on first sale: if Abe sells the property to Bo because Carl declines the right, the property is no longer subject to the right. Bo may resell it free of the ROFR. *Extinguished on declined/failed exercise: if Abe proposes to sell the property to Bo and Carl declines, or if Carl accepts but is unable to complete the transaction, the right is extinguished whether or not Abe ultimately sells the property. *Persistent: in contrast to the above two, in this case, the right runs with the property and binds the new purchaser. If Abe sells the property to Bo, Bo must offer the property to Carl first, just like Abe if Bo wishes to re-sell it. *Offer and acceptance terms: specific deadlines, procedures, and forms may be required. For example, Abe must give Carl a \\"notice of sale.\\" Carl has 30 days to accept or reject, with failure to respond counting as rejection. Carl must then close the transaction within that time, or that counts as a failed attempt to exercise. *Limited time period to close transaction: Abe offers the property to Carl under the ROFR, and Carl declines. Abe now has 60 days to close the transaction with Bo. If it cannot close within 60 days, Abe must offer it again to Carl before proceeding further with Bo. *Substitute purchaser allowed: Abe offers the property to Carl, who declines. Abe is then free to sell it to Bo but fails to do so. Abe may sell the property under the same terms to Erin instead without reoffering it to Carl. *No pending transaction required: Abe wishes to sell the house for $1 million but has not yet identified a purchaser. He prepares proposed sales terms and offers it to Carl on those terms. If Carl declines, Abe may then shop around for a purchaser. *Slight variations allowed in exercise: Abe enters an agreement with Bo calling for Bo to put down a 30% down payment, conduct certain inspections, and close the transaction in 20 days. He offers it to Carl at those terms. Carl accepts but is entitled to insist on a 20% down payment and a 30-day closing period. *Slight variations allowed in sale: Abe offers the house for $1 million to Carl, who declines. Abe then enters a transaction with Bo but during the escrow, Bo discovers a flaw in title and several defects. Abe is entitled to discount the price by $20,000 to close the sale with Bo without having to reoffer the house to Carl at $980,000. *Continuous: a continuous right of first refusal can be worded to continue to live, even upon infinite opportunities that are declined. Many other variations are possible. A fully drafted ROFR addresses all of the types of issues and more, and in the case of valuable or complex transactions it is subject to negotiation and review by business transaction attorneys. However, many ROFR are not completely specified. Even the best drafted ROFR agreements suffer a high risk of dispute and litigation because they are anticipating future transactions and contingencies that are unknowable when the ROFR originates. In venture capital In venture capital deals, the right of first refusal is a term sheet provision permitting existing investors in a company to accept or refuse the purchase of equity shares offered by the company, before third parties have access to the deal. The main goal of the provision is to allow investors to prevent ownership dilution as the company raises additional capital. Typically, the provision will exempt certain types of shares, such as those in an employee pool, or shares issued to equipment loaners or lessors. Startup companies are advised to attempt negotiating out this right, because it enables existing investors to send stronger (potentially negative) signals to new investors, and consequently drive down the company's valuation.

Doonside is located 40 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Featherdale Wildlife Park and the Nurragingy Nature Reserve are popular local tourist attractions. History The traditional owners and early settlement The Duruk people were once the owners of local land. The area now known as Doonside was named 'Bungarribee' (Bung meaning the 'creek' and garribee meaning 'cockatoo'). In 1802, Governor Philip Gidley King reserved a large proportion of land for a Government Stock Reserve. For the next twenty years the land was used as grazing land for cattle and sheep by convict herdsmen. In 1822 part of the Government stock run was granted by Governor Thomas Brisbane to Scottish immigrant, Robert Crawford. Robert first named his 1,000 acre (4 km¬≤) \\"Hill End\\". Crawford likely named this Doonside. The region had various names, including Crawford, before officially becoming Doonside.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia Robert James Crawford (1799-1848) had four children with Mary Campbell (d. 1832): Mary Crawford (b. 1826), Robert Crawford (1827-1906), George Canning Crawford (b. 1828), and Agnes C. Crawford (b. 1831). (Robert Crawford's four children's names are used today at Crawford Public School as sporting house teams). The elder Robert Crawford married Miss Jones of Bligh Street, Sydney, in 1832. Robert Crawford (1827-1906) married Victoria Margaret Smyth in 1868. Their son, Robert (1868-1930), born in the same year became a published poet.Acms.sl.nsw.gov.au Bungarribee House Bungarribee Homestead, 1954 Doonside In 1822 the area south of Hill End (Doonside) was granted to a Scottish-born settler named John Campbell (1771-1827).Blacktownaustralia.com.au The property and house had a series of owners and tenants in the 19th and 20th centuries until acquired by the Commonwealth Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) in 1949. The newly formed National Trust had been trying to secure a lease from OTC but was unable to come to an agreement citing unworkable lease conditions. A Local Historian John Lawson offered to restore the house but was rejected by O.T.C. Wolkara The Doonside name was changed briefly in 1921 to an Aboriginal name ‚ÄòWolkara‚Äô When the new railway station was being constructed, Wolkara was also the name of the post office that opened here in 1921, but in April 1929 it was changed back to Doonside, after local residents protested at the name change.Trove.nla.gov.au At the time of World War 1 Prior to 1916, the only development at Doonside was confined to the Crawford family. The Crawford homestead and acreage block was on the south side of the railway line facing Doonside Road. Kelburn Crawford's daughters house, was between the homestead and Bungarribee. North of the line on the corner of Hillend Road and Doonside Crescent, was a brick cottage owned by the Italian family, Luparno. Opposite was a small gatekeepers cottage. A brick home, owned by another Crawford daughter, was in Doonside Crescent. Properties fronted Hillend Road and were owned by Crawford children. Another cottage in Hillend Road was owned by the family named Harrison, in-laws to Crawford children. A workman's timber cottage was on the hill towards the tileworks' site. The only road into Doonside was Doonside Road, running from Western Highway. Hillend Road only went as far as Power Street after which there was a track to Richmond Road ending in a gate. Power Street went to Plumpton with the crossing over Eastern Creek being rough and dangerous in wet weather. After the war (1914-1918), the company of Porter and Galbraith bought property from Crawford and erected a tileworks (PGH) in an area which is now the suburb of Woodcroft. A soldier's settlement of about twenty poultry farms was established between the railway line and Bungarribee Road. Part of this land, during the 1930s depression, became a woman's settlement. Early Doonside There was no electricity until 1929 and water was drawn from wells. Horse-drawn carts would deliver bread and meat. Blacktown was accessed by train as there were not any buses or schools. Parramatta and Penrith, were the nearest high schools. A store and post office were opened unofficially in 1926 by Bill Francis on the corner of Hillend Road and Cross Street. For some years his nephew Jack Francis operated the post office on the other side of the railway line but once it was made official it returned to its original site until 1987. In 1955 electric trains came to Doonside and Edith Crawford from the founding family, also being the oldest inhabitant, was given the privilege of 'cutting the ribbon'. Her death was in 1956.  Heritage listings  Doonside has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Doonside Road: Bungarribee Homestead Site People Doonside's population was 13,451 in the 2016 Australian census. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 5.3% of the population. There was a mix of housing tenures in the suburb with 21.6% of properties owned outright, 30.6% being purchased and 43.6% being rented. The median household income of $1,340 per week was slightly lower than average and while the median rent ($310 per week) was also lower than average, the median mortgage repayment of $1,950 per month was higher. The most common industry of employment was hospitals (4.3%). 52.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Philippines 9.3%, India 4.6%, Fiji 3.3%, New Zealand 2.9% and England 1.3%. The most common ancestries were Australian 18.2%, English 15.4%, Filipino 9.2%, Indian 6.2% and Irish 4.0%. 52.8% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Tagalog 6.1%, Arabic 4.1%, Hindi 3.9%, Filipino 2.6% and Punjabi 2.3%.

Doonside Railway Platforms Transport Doonside railway station is on the North Shore & Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. It provides direct links east to Blacktown, Parramatta and Sydney CBD and west to Mount Druitt and Penrith. The Great Western Highway runs along the southern border and the M4 (Sydney) is just to the south. Busways offers a number of bus services in the suburb including: * route 753 from Doonside station to Blacktown Interchange through the north of the suburb; * routes 725/726 from Doonside to Blacktown through the south of the suburb. * route 756 from Blacktown to Mount Druitt, passing through the north of Doonside and providing connections with suburbs such as Woodcroft, Glendenning, Plumpton and Rooty Hill. Doonside Station 1880 A single line opened from Blacktown to Rooty Hill on 23 December 1861. The construction contract for the Blacktown to Kingswood section was awarded to Peto, Brassey & Betts in August 1859. The line was duplicated in 1886 and the station opened on 27 September 1880. The station was renamed Wolkara on 1 February 1921, and was subsequently renamed again to Doonside on 12 February 1921. The line was electrified on 9 October 1955. The present station was upgraded in 1955, replacing the original buildings. The design of the station buildings applied the railway Stripped Functionalist style, as was done at other stations between Lidcombe and St. Mary's. The station was one part of a much larger scheme to increase the tracks to four main lines between Lidcombe and St. Mary's during World War II in order to provide maximum track capacity to the American ammunition and general store built at Ropes Creek. Quadruplication was completed in 1981. A signal box was incorporated into the 1955 building but was closed in 1963 when automatic boom gates were provided at an adjacent level crossing which was itself removed in 1980. The signal box equipment has been removed. The pedestrian bridge that provides access to the platforms was built in 1958. Its twin beam construction is typical of 1940's footbridges on the Western line quadruplication. Since 1990, every component of the bridge, except the steel structure, has been replaced.Environment.nsw.gov.au Schools Doonside is home to two government run primary schools, Doonside Public School, near the station, and Crawford Public School, on Power Street in the north of the suburb. Not far from Crawford is Doonside Technology High School, a government run high school. There are two non-government schools in Doonside. Mountain View Adventist College, on Doonside Road south of the railway line, is run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and caters for students from Kindergarten to Year 12. St John Vianneys Primary School is a diocesan Catholic school associated with the neighbouring church, also called St John Vianney's Doonside Public School A 'Provisional' school was opened in 1903 but closed due to lack of support. It was reopened again in 1911 for two years. In 1937 Doonside Primary School was opened. The first application for the school was made to Blacktown Shire Council on 28 May 1934. It was unsuccessful because Council felt that Blacktown School was big enough to accommodate students and that there was a train service from Doonside to Blacktown. In March and November 1935 it was again applied for but declined for the same reasons. But after much consideration, approval was finally given on 14 July 1936 for a public school. An area of 4 acres 3 perches had been resumed for this purpose. The government Architect prepared plans and invited tenders (quote) for building the school. Mr S W Brown was accepted with the quote of 1,850 pounds. The building was completed and opened on 22 November 1937 with Mr Oscar Swanson as teacher. The first weeks enrolment was 53 by the end of term there were 58. 1939 saw the number of pupils increase to 94. By 1956 there were 202 and in 1962 the number had reached 600. The numbers continued to grow due to the development of the area as new estates and housing were established. Doonside Technology High School The High School was opened in 1964 as Doonside High School.http://www.westernsydneylibraries.nsw.gov.au/blacktown/education.html The School became a Technology High School in 1989. Crawford Public School Opened 1977 St John Vianneys Primary School Opened 1986 Recreation On the western edge of Doonside lies the Nurragingy Reserve, which is situated in the Western Sydney Regional Parklands. The Reserve is a 90ha park featuring picnic grounds and original bushland. It was established a nature reserve in 1981 and named after Nurragingy, a Darug man given a land grant in the Blacktown area in 1819. Just south of the railway line is the Featherdale Wildlife Park, a private zoo established in 1953 and specialising in Australian native animals and birds. Across the railway line from Nurragingy is Kareela Reserve, a sporting complex, home to a number of local sporting teams including the Doonside Roos rugby league team, Doonside Cricket Club and Doonside Little Athletics. The Doonside Hawks soccer club, the junior club of former Socceroos Captain Craig Moore, plays out of Glendenning Reserve in neighbouring Glendenning while the Doonside Diamonds Netball Club play all their games (home and away) at the Blacktown City Netball Association complex in Blacktown. All these clubs use maroon and white as their colours. = Doonside Junior Rugby League Club = The Rugby League Club Doonside Roos was founded in 1967 and its first committee meeting was held at the Doonside Hotel. The Colours of maroon and white and an embolem of a leaping Kangaroo were choosing to represent the club. The first games were played in the season of 1968 at Doonside High School's oval until a permanent home ground of Kareela Reserve (Kareela East Reserve) was completed. Games were played on Bert Sanders Reserve near Feathedale Wildlife Park one year due to the amenities at Kareela being destroyed in a fire. 1971 the club won its first premership. = Doonside Cricket Club = Doonside Cricket Club was established in 1975. Games are played on Kareela Reserve (Kareela East Reserve). = Doonside Hawks Soccer Club = The soccer club was founded in 1981. The club's first home ground was to be Kareela West Reserve Doonside (today Charlie Bali Reserve) but was not completed in time for the inaugural season, so game were played at Mt Druitt Sports Centre until it was finished. Today the club's home ground is Glendenning Reserve of Richmond Road Glendenning.

The group gained popularity in the early 1990s. They were founded in 1989, before they had the current lineup of Rub√©n Isaac Albarr√°n Ortega (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Emmanuel del Real D√≠az (keyboards, piano, programming, rhythm guitar, melodica, vocals), Jos√© Alfredo \\"Joselo\\" Rangel Arroyo (lead guitar, vocals), and Enrique \\"Quique\\" Rangel Arroyo: (bass guitar, electric upright bass, vocals), their friend Roberto Silva played the keyboards for a short period of time. Mexican folk music player Alejandro Flores was for a time considered the 5th tacubo, as he played the violin in almost every Caf√© Tacvba concert for many years. Since the Cuatro Caminos World Tour, Luis \\"El Children\\" Ledezma has played the drums in every concert but is not considered an official member of the band.  History = Formation (1989‚Äì90) = el Caf√© de Tacuba Previously known as \\"Alicia ya no vive aqu√≠\\" (a tribute to Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore), the band took its final name from a coffee shop (el Caf√© de Tacuba) located in downtown Mexico City. The cafe, which opened in 1912 and had its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s, was representative of the Pachuco scene at the time, something the band would later acknowledge as an influence. The Caf√© de Tacuba is still in operation as a coffee shop and restaurant on Tacuba Street, in Mexico City's Historic Center. The band changed its name to Caf√© Tacvba (changing the u for a v) in order to avoid legal issues with the coffee shop. Singer Rub√©n Albarran and guitarist Jos√© Alfredo Rangel met while studying graphic design at Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City. Rangel's brother, Enrique, completed the band's lineup in 1989. The group began playing music in the garage of a house in their neighborhood, Sat√©lite, an upper-middle-class suburban area in the Naucalpan municipality, in the northern region of the Mexico City metropolitan area. Caf√© Tacvba was principally influenced by alternative rock bands of the 1980s such as The Cure, The Clash, The Smiths, and Violent Femmes. Despite their English-language influences, the band members wanted to represent their native culture, so they incorporated Mexican influences into their music. The group began singing primarily in Spanish and changed their name to Caf√© Tacvba. Caf√© Tacvba went from being a garage band to a concert act in 1989, when they joined the scene surrounding El Hijo del Cuervo, a cultural club in Coyoac√°n featuring writers and musicians. As they performed in various venues around Mexico City, they were discovered by Argentinian music producer Gustavo Santaolalla, who at the time was producing albums for leading bands of the burgeoning Rock en Espa√±ol movement of the time. Santaolalla arranged a contract for the band with Warner Music Latina (WEA), with plans to produce its debut album himself. Caf√© Tacvba in turn proceeded to record their first song for commercial release, \\"Tamales de Iguanita,\\" which WEA released as part of a Christmas-themed rock en espa√±ol compilation, Diciembre 25, in 1990. = Early success (1991‚Äì96) = Caf√© Tacvba performing in Pontevedra, Spain. The group's debut album, Caf√© Tacvba, was released in 1992 and was extremely popular in Mexico. The group experimented with many different musical styles, from punk and ska, to electronica and hip hop, to regional Mexican varieties such norte√±o, bolero, and ranchera. However, the band was taken aback by the stark difference between the sound on the album and group's \\"rawer\\" live sound, likening the recording to \\"a pasteurized version of ourselves\\". Caf√© Tacuva released five singles from the album ‚Äì \\"Maria,\\" \\"Rarotonga\\", \\"Las Persianas\\", \\"La Chica Banda\\" and \\"Las Batallas\\" ‚Äì with a music video filmed for each, with the exception of the latter. \\"Mar√≠a\\", directed by Gustavo Garz√≥n, was nominated for Video of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards of 1993. Two years later, the band released a follow-up album, Re, in 1994. The singles \\"La Ingrata\\" (which had a music video directed by Fernando De Garay), \\"Las Flores\\" (which had a music video directed by Carlos Somonte) and \\"El Cicl√≥n\\" were also commercially successful. On the album, collaborators included Luis Conte and Alejandra Flores, while unconventional rock instrumentation such as jarana, guitarr√≥n, melodeon, and drum machines were employed. The album's mixture of genres such as alternative rock, punk, and metal with traditional Latin American styles helped the group develop a dedicated cult following. During the promotion of the album, the band's attendance at the 1995 New Music Seminar in New York helped garner some media attention in the United States. In 1996, Caf√© Tacvba released Avalancha de √âxitos, meaning \\"Avalanche of Hits\\", a covers album in which the band performed songs by other Spanish-speaking artists. The tracks were recorded while the band was in the studio working on Re and grew tired of recording new material. Avalancha de √âxitos marked Caf√© Tacvba's first appearance on Billboard's album charts (number 12 on the Latin Pop chart, 28 on Top Latin Albums), and the band commenced an international tour to promote the album. In 1996, the band also contributed to the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin produced by the Red Hot Organization performing along with David Byrne. The music video for the single \\"Como Te Extra√±o\\" was nominated for a Lo Nuestro Award. = Rev√©s/Yo Soy (1997‚Äì99) = In the wake of the group's international tour, Caf√© Tacvba withdrew from music for a while. When they returned to work, they gathered in their own studio and spent roughly a half-year working on experimental music that encompassed ambient electronica and musique concr√®te, as well as collaborative work with the Kronos Quartet, an American string quartet. Santaolalla liked the resulting music and deemed it ready for release. WEA, however, did not like the idea releasing an entirely instrumental album of experimental music, after the group had gained success with their more accessible style of music. In the end, WEA and Caf√© Tacvba reached a compromise: if the band would record a second album of more conventional material, the label would release both as a double-disc package and sell it for the cost of a standard single-disc album. As promised, the group returned to the studio to record an album of previously written material, and released Rev√©s/Yo Soy in 1999. The album was a double- disc set, featuring both the band's instrumental music and the newly recorded album. The album is notable for its unconventional packaging style, designed by vocalist Rub√©n Isaac Albarr√°n. In addition, the album titles Rev√©s (which translates to \\"reverse\\") and Yo Soy (a palindrome), exemplify the band's eccentricity. The album also featured two popular singles, \\"La Locomotora\\" and \\"La Muerte Chiquita,\\" and a music video for \\"Rev√©s,\\" directed by Adolfo D√°vila. The album won a Latin Grammy for Best Rock Album. = Hiatus and signing with MCA (2000‚Äì02) = After Rev√©s/Yo Soy, the group would not release another album for four years. In the meantime, Caf√© Tacvba contributed recordings to various projects such as the Amores Perros (2000) and Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n (2002) soundtracks as well as the tribute album El Mas Grande Homenaje a Los Tigres del Norte (2001), which included a cover of \\"Futurismo y Tradici√≥n.\\" In addition, guitarists Emmanuel del Real D√≠az and Joselo Rangel produced a couple songs for Julieta Venegas: \\"Me Van a Matar\\" and \\"Disco Eterno\\". Rangel also began work on a solo album, Oso, in 2003, which was produced by Albarr√°n. While Caf√© Tacvba pursued these various projects, they were looking for a new recording contract; the WEA relationship had come to an end after a trio of compilations released in 2001: Tiempo transcurrido: The Best of Caf√© Tacvba; a videos collection of the same name; and Lo Esencial de Caf√© Tacvba, a triple-disc package containing the band's first three albums. Maverick Records, Madonna's label, reportedly attempted to sign Caf√© Tacvba during this time; however, the band decided ultimately to sign with MCA Records in 2002. = Cuatro Caminos (2003‚Äì06) = When Caf√© Tacvba began work on Cuatro Caminos, the band took a different approach than in the past. They decided to work with a live drummer, and recruited Victor Indrizzo and Joey Waronker. Secondly, they wanted to work with a couple choice producers besides Santaolalla and Kerpel; they recruited Dave Friedman and Andrew Weiss. Released in June 2003, Cuatro Caminos was met with commercial and critical success. The album won a Grammys for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album as well as two Latin Grammys for Best Alternative Album and Best Rock Song (\\"Eres\\"). The group toured extensively after the release of Cuatro Caminos, and released a live album of a performance in front of 20,000 people in Mexico City at El Palacio de los Deportes in October 2004. The album was called Un Viaje, and was a double-disc set. After the release of the album, the group took a three- year break from releasing music. = Sino (2007‚Äì2010) = Caf√© Tacvba performing in Buenos Aires, Argentina on February 22, 2008 In 2007 Caf√© Tacvba returned with a new studio album, Sino. The album has been compared to classic rock groups such as The Who and the Beach Boys, a departure from their previous techno and funk-influenced sound. The band also performed on the main stage at Lollapalooza that summer. On September 10, 2008, Caf√© Tacvba became the leading nominee at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2008 with a total of six nominations: Album of the Year and Alternative Music Album, for Sino. The lead single \\"Volver a Comenzar\\" was shortlisted for Record of the Year and Best Alternative Song, the second single \\"Esta Vez\\" received nominations for Best Rock Song and Song of the Year. The band took the record for most Latin Grammys won in one night. The inclusion of the song \\"Volver a Comenzar\\" in LittleBigPlanet projected the band internationally. In 2008, the band collaborated with Puerto Rican duo Calle 13 on the song \\"No Hay Nadie Como T√∫\\".

Members = Rub√©n Isaac Albarr√°n Ortega = Rub√©n Isaac Albarr√°n Vocalist and guitar player. Previously, until 2001, he played in an alternative band called Villa Jard√≠n. In 2006 he announced his solo debut, Bienvenido al sue√±o (Welcome to the Dream), it consists of electronic instruments with Buddhist influences and Prehispanic Mexican which he describes as \\"m√∫sica prot√≥nica por no limitarlo o estereotiparlo\\" (protonic music so as not to limit or stereotype it). He is also known as \\"Juan\\", \\"Cosme\\", \\"Masiosare\\", \\"An√≥nimo\\" (Anonymous), \\"Nr√º\\" (pronunciation given as \\"Dshiu\\" in Spanish; perhaps intended to be ), \\"Amparo Tonto Medardo In Lak‚Äôech\\" or \\"At Medardo ILK\\", \\"G3\\", \\"Gallo Gasss\\" (Gasss Rooster), \\"√âlfego Buend√≠a\\", \\"Rita Cantalagua\\", \\"Sizu Yantra\\", \\"Ixaya Mazatzin Tley√≥tl\\", \\"Ixxi Xoo\\" and now \\"Cone Cahuitl\\". He lived the first four years of his life in Monterrey. Studied at UAM (Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana) where he received a bachelor's degree in Design and Graphic Communication. Rub√©n, or however he is now known, has always pushed gender norms through provocative lyrics, and the occasional skirt worn on stage at concerts. In the shows prior to the release of their first album, people would yell \\"Juan!\\" (the name of one of the band's first underground hits) to Rub√©n, so he kept the name for the release of the first album. Two years later he got bored and changed it to \\"Cosme\\" for the release of \\"Re\\". Since then, he has changed his name for every album and world tour. In 2010, while on break from Caf√© Tacvba, Rub√©n Albarr√°n formed a side project called HopPo!Contreras, Felix. \\"Cafe Tacuba Lead Singer Launches New Band\\", National Public Radio (NPR), October 23, 2010.

Hoppo's self-titled debut album consists of Latin American folk cover songs, and no original material. This particular type of folk music, also known as Nueva Canci√≥n, was originally written in the 1960s and 1970s during a social movement of protest and anti-establishment sentiment by South American singer-songwriters and social activists. The album contains three songs written by Violeta Parra, including \\"Gracias a la Vida\\".Autobombo. \\"Hoppo!, la nueva banda del cantante de Caf√© Tacuba\\", Zona Indie, October 12, 2010.

For a long time he only sang backup, but since the release of Re in 1992, he began singing lead on songs like El Borrego (The Lamb) or Pez (Fish), he also began playing the guitar more than before. On the covers album Avalancha de √âxitos he plays guitar on No Controles (Don't Control). Since then he's also been known to play the jarana. Del Real has written some of the band's biggest hits such as La Ingrata (The Ingrate), Las Flores (The Flowers), Avi√©ntame (Throw Me) and Eres (You Are). He is known in the Mexican electronica scene as \\"DJ Angustias\\"; is part of the Noiselab collective; and released a solo album in late 2005. Del Real has also produced songs for many Mexican artists like Julieta Venegas, Natalia Lafourcade, Ely Guerra, and Liquits, among others. = Jos√© Alfredo Rangel Arroyo = Joselo Rangel Jos√© \\"Joselo\\" Alfredo Rangel, spent the first 9 years of his life in Minatitl√°n, Veracruz, until his family moved to Mexico DF where he studied industrial design in the UAM. During his youth he had various hobbies like comic books and design even though he decided music was his major passion. While in college he met a person with a peculiar voice and extravagant ideas: Albarr√°n. They became best friends and with his brother, Enrique \\"Quique\\" Rangel and they formed a band called Alicia Ya No Vive Aqu√≠. Later on he started working on a new project called \\"Cafe Tacuba\\" with Ruben Albarran on the vocals, Enrique \\"Quique\\" Rangel on the bass (contrabajo) and Roberto Silva on the keyboards. Emmanuel del Real took the place of Roberto when he left before the band became famous. After 13 years with the band Rangel decided to launch a solo side project. He has released two albums: the first, 2001's \\"Oso\\" (Bear), named after Joselo's childhood nickname; the second, titled \\"Lejos\\" (Far) in 2005. He wrote four books, CRock√≥nicas Marcianas (a compilation of chronicles, 2011), the collection od stories One hit wonder (2015), the novel Los desesperados (2018) and Cuba Stone (2016), a review about The Rolling Stones' concert in Cuba, in collaboration with Javier Sinay and Jerem√≠as Gamboa. Quique Rangel = Enrique Rangel Arroyo = Enrique Rangel Arroyo ‚Äì Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre. Es.wikipedia.org. Retrieved on 2013-05-31. Enrique \\"Quique\\" Rangel Arroyo was a designer whose interest in music was influenced by his brother Joselo. He was introduced to Albarr√°n by Joselo and together, along with Beto Silva, formed \\"Cafe Tacuba\\". He abandoned his career as a designer when he brought the band De Real in the late 80s and they changed their name to Caf√© Tacvba. He designs album art for other bands and, like De Real, composes melodies for other groups. He is also a member of a side project called Los Odio. = Alejandro Flores = Folk musician Alejandro Flores plays violin and is considered the fifth Tacubo. He has played with the band since 1994. He has also participated on two LPs by San Pascualito Rey. = Luis Ledezma = Also known as \\"El Children\\", Ledezma is the band's live drummer but is not considered an official band member.  Genre  Their musical style covers a wide variety of genres, though it is most commonly labeled as Latin Alternative/Rock en Espa√±ol. Their music has been heavily influenced by Mexico's indigenous population and folk music traditions, but also by punk and electronic music and other bands on the Mexico City scene. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of their music is Albarr√°n's nasal voice, which, combined with his impressive lung capacity (as demonstrated on \\"La Ingrata\\", a homage of norte√±o music), makes for a very distinctive sound. They sing entirely in Spanish but have a significant Anglophone following regardless. The song \\"Chilanga Banda\\" has a hip-hop beat under a stream of Mexico City slang originally written by Jaime L√≥pez, \\"Mar√≠a\\" is a 'bolero' ballad about a ghost, \\"El Fin de la Infancia\\" a brass-heavy 'banda ranchera' sound that reflects the influence of 'banda sinaloense', \\"Despert√©\\" has a tango-driven melody while \\"El Borrego\\" mocks speed metal.

His eclectic style of music was often difficult to classify, encompassing the rockabilly, jazz, blues, country, soul, and gospel genres. In the later part of his life, Rich acquired the nickname the Silver Fox. He is perhaps best remembered for a pair of 1973 hits, \\"Behind Closed Doors\\" and \\"The Most Beautiful Girl\\". \\"The Most Beautiful Girl\\" topped the U.S. country singles charts, as well as the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles charts and earned him two Grammy Awards. Rich was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015. Early life Rich was born in Colt, Arkansas, United States, to rural cotton farmers. He graduated from Consolidated High School in Forrest City, where he played saxophone in the band. He was strongly influenced by his parents, members of the Landmark Missionary Baptist Church in Forrest City, as his mother, Helen Rich, played piano and his father sang in gospel quartets. A black sharecropper on the family land named C. J. Allen taught Rich blues piano. He enrolled at Arkansas State College on a football scholarship and then transferred to the University of Arkansas as a music major after a football injury. He left after one semester to join the United States Air Force in 1953. While stationed in Enid, Oklahoma, he formed \\"the Velvetones,\\" playing jazz and blues and featuring his wife, Margaret Ann, on vocals. He and Margaret Ann Greene married in 1952. Upon leaving the military in 1956, they returned to the West Memphis area to farm 500 acres. He also began performing in clubs around the Memphis area, playing both jazz and R&B.; During these times, he began writing his own material. Career After recording some demonstration songs for Sam Phillips at Sun Records that Phillips considered not commercial enough and \\"too jazzy\\", he was given a stack of Jerry Lee Lewis records and told: \\"Come back when you get that bad.\\" In a September 6, 2010, NPR airing of a 1992 interview with Fresh Air host Terry Gross, Charlie Rich tells the story, himself, of Bill Justis telling Rich's wife those words. In 1958, Rich became a regular session musician for Sun Records, playing on a variety of records by Lewis, Johnny Cash, Bill Justis, Warren Smith, Billy Lee Riley, Carl Mann, and Ray Smith. He also wrote several songs for Lewis, Cash, and others. His third single for the Sun subsidiary, Phillips International Records, was the 1960 Top 30 hit, \\"Lonely Weekends\\", which was notable for its Presley-like vocals. It sold more than one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America. None of his seven follow-up singles was a success, however, though several of the songs became staples in his live set, including \\"Who Will the Next Fool Be\\", \\"Sittin' and Thinkin'\\", and \\"No Headstone on My Grave\\". These songs were often recorded by others to varying degrees of success, such as the Bobby Bland version of \\"Who Will the Next Fool Be\\". Rich's career then stalled and he left the struggling Sun label in 1963, signing with Groove, a subsidiary of RCA Victor. His first single for Groove, \\"Big Boss Man\\", was a minor hit, but once again, his Chet Atkins-produced follow-up records all failed. Rich moved to Smash Records in 1965. Rich's new producer, Jerry Kennedy, encouraged the pianist to emphasize his country and rock n' roll leanings, although Rich considered himself a jazz pianist and had not paid much attention to country music since childhood. His first single for Smash was \\"Mohair Sam\\", an R&B-inflected; novelty-rock number written by Dallas Frazier, and it became a top 30 pop hit. Unfortunately again for Rich, none of his follow-up singles were successful. Rich again changed labels, moving to Hi Records, where he recorded blue-eyed soul music and straight country, but once more, none of his singles for Hi made a dent on the country or pop charts. One Hi Records track, \\"Love Is After Me\\", from 1966, belatedly became a white soul favorite in the early-1970s. =Career peak in the 1970s= Despite his lack of consistent commercial success, Epic Records signed Rich in 1967, mainly on the recommendation of producer Billy Sherrill. Sherrill helped Rich refashion himself as a Nashville Sound balladeer during an era when old rock 'n' roll artists like Jerry Lee Lewis and Conway Twitty were finding a new musical home in the country and western format. This new \\"countrypolitan\\" Rich sound paid off in the summer of 1972, when \\"I Take It on Home\\" went to number six on the country charts. The title track from his 1973 album Behind Closed Doors became a number-one country hit early in that year, then crossing over into the top 20 on the pop charts. This time, his follow-up single did not disappoint, as \\"The Most Beautiful Girl\\" spent three weeks at the top of the country charts and two weeks at the top of the pop charts. Now that he was established as a country music star, Behind Closed Doors won three awards from the Country Music Association that year: Best Male Vocalist, Album of the Year, and Single of the Year. The album was also certified gold. Rich won a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, and he took home four Academy of Country Music awards. One of RCA Victor's several resident songwriters, Marvin Walters, co-wrote for three years with Charlie, producing four recordings including the popular \\"Set Me Free\\". After \\"The Most Beautiful Girl,\\" number-one hits came quickly, as five songs topped the country charts in 1974 and crossed over to the pop charts. The songs were \\"There Won't Be Anymore\\" (pop number 18), \\"A Very Special Love Song\\" (pop number 11), \\"I Don't See Me In Your Eyes Anymore\\" (pop number 47), \\"I Love My Friend\\" (pop number 24), and \\"She Called Me Baby\\" (pop number 47). Both RCA Records and Mercury Records (Smash was a subsidiary of Mercury which was absorbed into the main company in 1970) re-released his previously recorded material from the mid-1960s, as well. All of this success led the CMA to name him Entertainer of the Year in 1974. In the same year he performed the Academy Award-nominated theme song \\"I Feel Love (Benji's Theme)\\" from the film Benji. Rich had three more top-five hits in 1975, but though he was at the peak of his popularity, Rich began to drink heavily, causing considerable problems off-stage.  CMA awards 1975  Rich's destructive personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA awards ceremony for 1975, when he presented the award for Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through the names of the nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was \\"My friend Mr. John Denver.\\" Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row- controlled Nashville Sound. Others speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too \\"pop\\" and not enough \\"country\\". Many, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich's popularity took a dive, recording just one more top ten single with \\"Since I Fell for You\\". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: \\"...why did he do it? I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I think he did it. Primarily he thought it would be funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver.\\" The slump in his career was exacerbated by the fact that his records began to sound increasingly similar: pop-inflected country ballads with overdubbed strings and little of the jazz or blues Rich had performed his entire life. He did not have a top-10 hit again until \\"Rollin' With the Flow\\" went to number one on the country charts (as well as number 32 on the easy listening charts) in 1977. Early the following year, in 1978, he signed with United Artists Records, and throughout that year, he had hits on both Epic and UA. His hits in 1978 included the top-10 hits \\"Beautiful Woman\\", \\"Puttin' In Overtime At Home\\", and his last number one with \\"On My Knees\\", a duet with Janie Fricke. =Decline in activity and semiretirement= Rich struggled throughout 1979 having hits with United Artists and Epic. His singles were moderate hits that year, the biggest of them on either UA or Epic was a version of \\"Spanish Eyes\\", which became a top-20 country hit. Rich appeared as himself in the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie, Every Which Way but Loose, in which he performed the song \\"I'll Wake You Up When I Get Home\\". This song hit number three on the charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to Elektra Records, and released a number-12 single, \\"A Man Just Don't Know What a Woman Goes Through\\" in the fall of that year. One more top-40 hit followed, the Gary Stewart song \\"Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream\\" early in 1981, but Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight. For over a decade, Rich was silent, living off his investments in semi-retirement and only playing occasional concerts. He also played a bit part in the 1981 movie Take This Job and Shove It which yielded his last charted single, \\"You Made It Beautiful\\". In 1992, Rich released Pictures and Paintings, a jazzy album that was produced by journalist Peter Guralnick. This album was released via Sire Records. Pictures and Paintings received positive critical reviews and restored Rich's reputation as a musician, but it was his last album. In 2016, a tribute album entitled Feel Like Going Home: The Songs of Charlie Rich was released by Memphis International Records. Tom Waits, who was an opening act for Rich in the 1970s, mentions him in the song \\"Putnam County\\" from his album Nighthawks at the Diner with the lyric: \\"The radio's spitting out Charlie Rich... He sure can sing, that son of a bitch.\\" Death Charlie Rich and his wife were driving to Florida for a vacation after seeing their son Allan perform with Freddy Fender at Lady Luck Casino in Natchez, Mississippi, when he experienced a bout of severe coughing. After visiting a doctor in St. Francisville, Louisiana, and receiving antibiotics, he continued traveling until he stopped to rest for the night. Rich died in his sleep on July 25, 1995, in a Hammond, Louisiana, motel, he was 62 years old. The cause of death was a pulmonary embolism. He was buried in the Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Rich was survived by his wife of 43 years, Margaret, two sons, two daughters and three grandchildren. Margaret Rich died in Germantown, Tennessee, on July 22, 2010, and was buried alongside her husband.

It is made up of three separate companies: the Strasbourg-based European Economic Interest Grouping ARTE GEIE, plus two member companies acting as editorial and programme production centres, ARTE France in Paris (France) and ARTE Deutschland in Baden-Baden (Germany). As an international joint venture (an EEIG), its programmes focuses to audiences in both countries. Due to this, the channel features two audio tracks and two subtitle tracks, each in French and German. 80% of ARTE's programming are provided by its French and German subsidiaries, each making half of the programmes available, while the remainder is being provided by the European subsidiary and the channel's European partners. ARTE France was formerly known as La Sept. ARTE Deutschland TV GmbH is a subsidiary of the two main public German TV networks ARD and ZDF. Selected programmes are available with English, Spanish, Polish and Italian subtitles online.Pressemitteilung: Der europ√§ische Kultursender Arte jetzt auch auf Englisch und Spanisch History The ARTE building in Strasbourg ARTE began transmission in 1992, filling frequencies left unused by the demise of La Cinq, the first French commercial television network (created in 1986). The opening night on 30 May 1992 was broadcast live from the Strasbourg Opera House. ARTE started out as an evening-only service. In the daytime, the frequencies were shared with other channels. A public channel called T√©l√© emploi occupied the French frequencies for about a month during 1994, before the start of La Cinqui√®me (now France 5) in December that year. For German viewers, ARTE was assigned a frequency on the Astra 1D satellite in late 1994, and it was eventually shared with Nickelodeon Germany, later replaced by the new public children's channel Kinderkanal. In 1996, it started offering an afternoon schedule with reruns for viewers on digital satellite and digital cable. A \\"proper\\" afternoon schedule with programmes between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. was introduced on 6 January 2001.A R T E M a g a z i n e, 6 January 2001 The channel eventually got its own analogue frequency on the Astra satellites. Since 2005 ARTE broadcasts 24/7. In 2007 the catch-up service ARTE+7 is launched, offering internet users free access to a broad range of programs within seven days of their original transmission. Transmission and reception ARTE programmes are available with multi-channel audio: all programmes go out in French and in German. Furthermore the original version is screened whenever possible with subtitles in French and German and the hearing or visually impaired may get subtitles or an audio description. Since 2015 a selection of programmes are available with English and Spanish subtitles online, with Polish to follow in late 2016. The channel enjoys a major footprint in Europe. Both the German and the French version can be received in nearly whole Europe via the satellite Astra1 (19, 2¬∞ East), the French version is also available via Hot Bird (13¬∞ East). In addition ARTE is relayed not only by all cable networks in Germany and France, but by numerous cable networks in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and in the Netherlands too. Since 2008 ARTE broadcasts in HD in Germany and in France. Like the national channels of its own respective countries, the German HDTVversion of ARTE broadcasts in 720p50, while the French one broadcasts in 1080i25. In April 2016 ARTE co-produced (with Astra satellite owner, SES) a live Ultra-high-definition television broadcast of the Le Corsaire ballet from the Vienna State Opera. The programme was transmitted free-to-air on the UHD1 demonstration channel from the Astra 19.2¬∞E satellites.SES and ARTE to Broadcast Le Corsaire Ballet Live in Ultra HD via Astra 19.2 Business Wire. 29 March 2016. Accessed 27 April 2016 Online ARTE programmes can be streamed live or watched on catch-up TV for at least 7 and up to 700 days on ARTE+7 and the theme platforms ARTE Concert, Creative, Info, Future or Cinema. =International= In Africa, ARTE is broadcast via satellite, cable, MMDS and ADSL in many other countries, via the digital service CanalSat Horizons. Many French-language ARTE programs are also broadcast in Canada on the Ici ARTV cable channel, partly owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (85%) and ARTE itself (15%). The Australian Special Broadcasting Service translates many ARTE programs into English for broadcast on its own television network and overseas. Market Share ARTE usually has more viewers in France than in Germany. In 2015, its share of overall viewing was about 2.2% in France and about 1% in Germany. The differences can be put down to the different television markets in both countries. In France, ARTE was for a long time available to almost everyone as one of six analogue terrestrial channels. Relatively few French households received cable and satellite television, and the other terrestrial channels didn't really compete with ARTE. Meanwhile, thanks to widespread roll-out of cable television, the vast majority of German households had access to about three dozen channels, including several from the public broadcasters with content similar to Arte.Zehn Jahre arte After the introduction of digital terrestrial television in France, ARTE's market share has fallen there, while it has been more or less flat in Germany.

Soviets were created by Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, Anarchists and Libertarians.https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/anarchist-studies/20-2/anarchism-and- council-communism-russian-revolution Soviets were the main form of government in the Free Territory, Russian SFSR and to a much lesser extent were active in the Russian Provisional Government.https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny- hccc-worldhistory2/chapter/the-provisional-government/ It also can mean any workers council that is socialist such as the Irish soviets. Soviets do not inherently need to adhere to the ideology of the later Soviet Union. Etymology \\"Soviet\\" is derived from a Russian word signifying council, assembly, advice, harmony, concord, (rada); ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; and all ultimately deriving from the Proto-Slavic verbal stem of *vƒõt-iti \\"to inform\\", related to Slavic \\"vƒõst\\" (\\"news\\"), English \\"wise\\", the root in \\"ad-vis-or\\" (which came to English through French), or the Dutch \\"weten\\" ('to know'; cf. \\"wetenschap\\" 'science'). The word \\"sovietnik\\" means councillor. A number of organizations in Russian history were called \\"council\\" (). For example, in Imperial Russia, the State Council, which functioned from 1810 to 1917, was referred to as a Council of Ministers after the revolt of 1905. Russian Empire  Deputies of the first soviet, 1905. = Workers' councils = According to the official historiography of the Soviet Union, the first workers' council (soviet) formed in May 1905 in Ivanovo (north-east of Moscow) during the 1905 Russian Revolution (Ivanovsky Soviet). However, in his memoirs, the Russian Anarchist Volin claims that he witnessed the beginnings of the St Petersburg Soviet in January 1905. The Russian workers were largely organized at the turn of the 20th century, leading to a government-sponsored trade-union leadership. In 1905, as the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) increased the strain on Russian industrial production, the workers began to strike and rebel. The soviets represented an autonomous workers' movement, one that broke free from the government's oversight of workers' unions and played a major role in the 1905 Russian Revolution. Soviets sprang up throughout the industrial centers of Russia, usually organizing meetings at the factory level. These soviets disappeared after the revolution of 1905, but re-emerged under socialist leadership during the revolutions of 1917. Soviets emerged as inclusive bodies to lead workers, and to organize strikes and to politically and militarily fight the government of Russian empire mainly through direct action, with the primary actors being non-totalitarian leftists, including socialist revolutionaries and anarchists as Lenin's party was a minority.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of- social-history/article/russian-revolution-and-the-labour-movements-of- australia-and-new- zealand-19171922/038C9F59491FA401B87E6C309C4008E1https://books.google.com/books?id=okxdDwAAQBAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false During this time they established minor worker cooperatives though the operations were minor due to Russian crackdown on leftist organizations.http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/600/comparing-the- tsarist-russian-and-soviet-empires Russian Revolution The popular organizations which came into existence during the Russian Revolution were called \\"Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies.\\" These bodies were supposed to hold things together under the provisional government until the election of a constituent assembly could take place; in a sense, they were vigilance committees designed to guard against counter-revolution. The Petrograd Soviet of 4,000 members was the most important of these, on account of its position in the capital and its influence over the garrison. At the beginning of the Revolution, these soviets were under control of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and even the Mensheviks had a larger share of the elected representatives than the Bolsheviks. As World War I continued and the Russians met defeat after defeat, and the provisional government proved inadequate at establishing industrial peace, the Bolsheviks began to grow in support. By degrees, the Bolsheviks dominated with a leadership which demanded \\"all power to the soviets.\\" The Bolsheviks promised the workers a government run by workers' councils to overthrow the bourgeoisie's main government body - the Provisional Government. In October 1917, the provisional government was overthrown, giving all power to the Soviets. John Reed, an American eyewitness to the October Revolution, wrote, \\"Until February 1918 anybody could vote for delegates to the Soviets. Even had the bourgeoisie organised and demanded representation in the Soviets, they would have been given it. For example, during the regime of the Provisional Government there was bourgeois representation in the Petrograd Soviet ‚Äì a delegate of the Union of Professional Men which comprised doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc.\\" Similarly, Leon Trotsky wrote in Terrorism and Communism (1920) that \\"In Petrograd, in November 1917, we also elected a Commune (Town Council) on the basis of the most democratic voting, without limitations for the bourgeoisie. These elections, being boycotted by the bourgeoisie parties, gave us a crushing majority. The democratically elected Council voluntarily submitted to the Petrograd Soviet... the Soviet Government placed no obstacle in the way of the bourgeois parties; and if the Cadets, the SRs and the Mensheviks, who had their press which was openly calling for the overthrow of the Soviet Government, boycotted the elections, it was only because at that time they still hoped soon to make an end of us with the help of armed force... If the Petrograd bourgeoisie had not boycotted the municipal elections, its representatives would have entered the Petrograd Council. They would have remained there up to the first Social Revolutionary and Cadet rising, after which...they would probably have been arrested if they did not leave the Council in good time, as at a certain moment did the bourgeois members of the Paris Commune.\\" Lenin wrote that the soviets were originally politically open and inclusive entities, writing in The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky (1918) that, \\"the disenfranchisement of the bourgeoisie is not a necessary and indispensable feature of the dictatorship of the proletariat. And in Russia, the Bolsheviks, who long before October put forward the slogan of proletarian dictatorship, did not say anything in advance about disenfranchising the exploiters. This aspect of the dictatorship did not make its appearance \\"according to the plan\\" of any particular party; it emerged of itself in the course of the struggle ... even when the Mensheviks (who compromised with the bourgeoisie) still ruled the Soviets, the bourgeoisie cut themselves off from the Soviets of their own accord, boycotted them, put themselves up in opposition to them and intrigued against them. The Soviets arose without any constitution and existed without one for more than a year (from the spring of 1917 to the summer of 1918). The fury of the bourgeoisie against this independent and omnipotent (because it was all‚Äîembracing) organisation of the oppressed; the fight, the unscrupulous, self‚Äîseeking and sordid fight, the bourgeoisie waged against the Soviets; and, lastly, the overt participation of the bourgeoisie (from the Cadets to the Right Socialist‚ÄîRevolutionaries, from Milyukov to Kerensky) in the Kornilov mutiny ‚Äì all this paved the way for the formal exclusion of the bourgeoisie from the Soviets.\\" The Bolsheviks and their allies came out with a program called \\"soviet government.\\" The soviet system was described as \\"a higher type of state\\" and \\"a higher form of democracy\\" which would \\"arouse the masses of the exploited toilers to the task of making new history.\\" Furthermore, it offered \\"to the oppressed toiling masses the opportunity to participate actively in the free construction of a new society\\". According to Lenin, the author of these quotations, soviet rule \\"is nothing else than the organized form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\\" A code of rules governing elections to the soviets was framed in March 1918, but the following classes were disqualified to vote: \\"Those who employ others for profit; those who live on incomes not derived from their own work ‚Äì interest on capital, industrial enterprises or landed property; private business men, agents, middlemen; monks and priests of all denominations; ex-employees of the old police services and members of the Romanov dynasty; lunatics and criminals.\\" With village and factory soviets as a base, there arose a vast pyramid of district, cantonal, county and regional soviets, each with its executive soviet. Over and above these stood the \\"All- Russian Soviet Congress,\\" which appointed an \\"All-Russian Central Executive Committee\\" of not more than 200 members, which in turn chooses the \\"Soviet of People's Commissaries\\" ‚Äî the Ministry. Beginning with a minimum of three and maximum of 50 members for smaller communities, the maximum for town soviets was fixed at 1,000 members. The soviet system was seen as an alternative to parliamentary systems for administering republican governments. Status Within the Soviet Union Based on the Bolshevik view of the state, the word soviet extended its meaning to any overarching body that obtained the authority of a group of soviets. In this sense, individual soviets became part of a federal structure - Communist government bodies at local level and republic levelEarlier, in the Russian SFSR, there were three levels of soviet hierarchy: local, republic, and federal-republic. were called \\"soviets\\", and at the top of the hierarchy, the Congress of Soviets became the nominal core of the Union government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), officially formed in December 1922. Successive Soviet Constitutions recognised the leading role of the Communist Party in politics, - the 1936 Constitution deemed it the \\"leading nucleus of all organisations of workers, whether public or state\\". The soviets were structured as the instruments through which the Party governed the country. Thus the organs of the Communist Party (the highest being the Central Committee) made decisions on state policy, while the soviets acted as a system for public approval of implementing the Party's programme. Later, in the USSR, local-government bodies were named soviet (sovet: council) with an adjective indicating the administrative level, customarily abbreviated: gorsovet (gorodskoy sovet: city council), raysovet/raisovet' (rayonny sovet: raion council), selsovet (sel'sky sovet: rural council), possovet (poselkovy sovet: settlement council). In practice deputies in a soviet often worked in standing committees and carried out functions with the help of unpaid volunteers (the aktiv - ). Function within Soviet Union As outlined in the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, and successively the 1924 Constitution of the Soviet Union and 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, the Soviets were the basis of government in the USSR.http://pwerth.faculty.unlv.edu/Const-USSR-1924(abridge).pdf Factory and village Soviets would send delegates to town Soviets, and in turn the town Soviet would send delegates to the regional Soviet, town and regional Soviets elected delegates to the provincial Soviet, provincial Soviets sent delegates to the Soviet of the constituent republic, and the Soviets of the Union Republics sent delegates to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. As of 1936, the election of delegates up the pyramid became direct. Local constituents within the factory and village soviet would compile a list of what they want the government to do, and the role of the elected delegates was to carry out the given tasks. Unsatisfactory delegates are liable to recall by majority decision of the electorate: in the 30s, fifteen delegates were so recalled within four years in Moscow alone. There were very few full time administrative workers or state functionaries; instead, many citizens would take part in the day-to-day running of the government. In the 1940s, it was estimated that at any given time there were over a million people participating in the running of the Soviets. Each Soviet has a variety of committees, parallel to the government departments in the USSR as a whole- public employees aided, advised and ran their relevant committees- for example, teachers would be on education sections, and doctors on healthcare sections: The Union Republics, Provinces and Town Soviets had jurisdiction to run their own industry, take censuses, employ more doctors, teachers, and nurses, build schools, libraries and hospitals so long as it did not directly conflict with the national policy. More than half of the Union Republic‚Äôs income went towards local grants, and local Soviets were largely allowed to determine how their budget was spent.file:///home/chronos/u-414c9121c1eaeffe35688cda3562207ee6e3d5bf/MyFiles/Downloads/Pat%20Sloan%20-%20Soviet%20Democracy- Victor%20Gollancz%20(1937).pdf Modern Russia Although English speakers perceive the term as connoting the defunct Soviet Union, the same word is used in Russian for the Upper House (Council or Senate) of the modern Russian Parliament. Its untranslated name is –°–æ–≤–µÃÅ—Ç –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞ÃÅ—Ü–∏–∏ (Soviet Federatsii). Outside Russia The term soon came to be used outside the former Russian Empire following 1917. The Limerick Soviet was formed in Ireland in 1919. A soviet republic was established in Bavaria on 7 April 1919. In 1920, the Workers' Dreadnought published \\"A Constitution for British Soviets\\" in preparation for the launch of the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International).\\"A Constitution for British Soviets,\\" Workers' Dreadnought, Vol VII No.13 19 June 1919 Here the focus was on \\"household\\" soviets \\"[i]n order that mothers and those who are organisers of the family life of the community may be adequately represented.\\" = Germany = In the wake of World War I, the Social Democrats took power in Bavaria, setting up a \\"People's State\\" under the leadership of Kurt Eisner, a popular Jewish writer. Eisner, an eccentric and well known figure in Munich, succeeded in carrying out a bloodless coup with a few hundred men on 7 November 1918, occupying the seat of parliament and government, and proclaiming a republic. He was assassinated three months after, whereupon a short-lived soviet republic was established by the Bavarian workers. On 1 May 1919, the Regular Army, along with local Bavarian Freikorps, overthrew the nascent republic, massacring several hundred persons in the process, including many non-Communist. A Social Democratic government was thereupon restored, however, political power passed to the Bavarian right. The political turmoil of post-war Bavaria was also the political springboard of Hitler's political career. Hitler, having returned to Munich in late November 1918, detested the soviet state (he elaborated on his aversion to it in his autobiographical work, Mein Kampf, where he also claimed he once narrowly avoided arrest by the state). After the fall of the socialist administration in Bavaria, Hitler began his \\"first more or less political activity\\", informing a military commission regarding those involved in the short-lived soviet state. This work might have ensured his future employment in the Munich military as an \\"educational officer\\" whose task was combating \\"dangerous\\" ideas like socialism, pacifism, and democracy, among the army's ranks (many soldiers had taken part in the German Revolution, in fact it was begun by German sailors).

According to the Roman foundation myth, Titus Tatius was the king of the Sabines from Cures and joint-ruler of Rome for several years. During the reign of Romulus, the first king of Rome, Tatius declared war on Rome in response to the incident known as the rape of the Sabine women. After he captured the stronghold atop the Capitoline Hill through the treachery of Tarpeia, the Sabines and Romans fought an epic battle that concluded when the abducted Sabine women intervened to convince the two sides to reconcile and end the war. The two kingdoms were joined and the two kings ruled jointly until Tatius' murder five years later. The joint kingdom was still called Rome and the citizens of the city were still called Romans, but as a community, they were to be called Quirites. The Sabines were integrated into the existing tribes and curies. Tatius is not counted as one of the traditional \\"Seven Kings of Rome.\\" He had one daughter Tatia, who married Numa Pompilius (Romulus's successor), and one son, who was the ancestor of the noble family of Tatii. War with Rome Dionysius of Halicarnassus ( 60 BC ‚Äì after 7 BC) reports that after a year of preparation, Rome and the Sabines engaged in several skirmishes and minor engagements before fighting two major battles. Two days after the first battle, the second and final battle between them took place in between the two Roman hills they were occupying. It was an epic contest, featuring multiple reversals wherein each army had and then lost the upper hand. At the end of the day, the Sabines retreated to the citadel and the Romans didn't pursue them. Before combat could be resumed, the Sabine women, some in funerary attire, some carrying their children with them, convinced Tatius and Romulus to end the fighting. After a ceasefire, the nations signed a treaty creating a single kingdom under the joint rule of both kings, who reigned together until the death of Tatius. Death The two kings together oversaw an expansion of Rome and the building of several landmarks, as well as the conquest of Cameria. Their first disagreement came in the sixth year of their reign. Dionysius relates that some of Tatius' friends had victimized some Laurentii and when the city sent ambassadors to demand justice, Tatius would not allow Romulus to hand over the perpetrators. After the ambassadors had left for home, a group of Sabines waylaid them as they slept. Some escaped and when word got back to Rome, Romulus promptly arrested and surrendered the men responsibleincluding a member of Tatius' own family over to a new group of ambassadors. Tatius followed the group out of the city and freed the accused men by force. Later, while both kings were participating in a sacrifice in Lavinium, he was killed in retribution. Dionysius also tells the account of Licinius Macer, wherein Tatius was killed when he went alone to try and convince the victims in Lavinium to forgive the crimes committed. When they discovered he had not brought the men responsible with him, as the senate and Romulus had ordered, an angry mob stoned him to death. Historicity According to Mommsen, the story of his death, (for which see Plutarch) looks like an historical version of the abolition of blood-revenge. Tatius, who in some respects resembles Remus, is not a historical personage, but the eponymous hero of the religious college called Sodales Titii. As to this body Tacitus expresses two different opinions, representing two different traditions: that it was introduced either by Tatius himself to preserve the Sabine cult in Rome;Tacitus Annals 1.54. or by Romulus in honour of Tatius, at whose grave its members were bound to offer a yearly sacrifice.Tacitus Histories 2.95. The sodales fell into abeyance at the end of the republic, but were revived by Augustus and existed to the end of the 2nd century AD. Augustus himself and the emperor Claudius belonged to the college, and all its members were of senatorial rank. Varro mentions him as a king of Rome who enlarged the city and established certain cults, but he may just have been the eponym of the tribe Titiae, or even an invention to serve as a precedent for collegial magistracy. Gary Forsythe believes Titus Tatius could well have been the first real king of Rome, later replaced in the accepted narrative by the unhistorical Romulus and Remus whose names have been construed from that of the city itself.

On July 3, 1863, as part of Pickett's Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg, Armistead led his brigade to the farthest point reached by Confederate forces during the charge, a point now referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy. However, he and his men were overwhelmed, and he was wounded and captured by Union troops. He died in a field hospital two days later. Early life Armistead, known to friends as \\"Lo\\" (for Lothario),Wright, p. 179, describes this name as \\"a joke on the shy and quiet-spoken widower who was known to admire the ladies.\\" Foote, pp. 533-34, writes \\"A widower ... he was a great admirer of the ladies and enjoyed posing as a swain. This had earned him the nickname 'Lo,' an abbreviation Lothario, which was scarcely in keeping with his close-cropped, grizzled beard or receding hairline. was born in the home of his great-grandfather, John Wright Stanly, in New Bern, North Carolina, to Walker Keith Armistead and Elizabeth Stanly. He came from an esteemed military family.Armistead, lewis addison (1817-1863). Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History. 2000. Armistead was of entirely English descent, and all of his ancestry had been in Virginia since the early 1600s.The Armistead Family: 1635-1910 By Virginia Armistead Garber pg. 15 The first of his ancestors to emigrate to North America was William Armistead from Yorkshire, England. Encyclopedia Smithsonian: Star Spangled Banner and the War of 1812: Making the Star Spangled Banner Armistead's father was one of five brothers who fought in the War of 1812; another was Major George Armistead, the commander of Fort McHenry during the battle that inspired Francis Scott Key to write \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", which would later become the national anthem of the United States. On his mother's side, his grandfather John Stanly was a U.S. Congressman, and his uncle Edward Stanly served as military governor of eastern North Carolina during the Civil War. Armistead attended the United States Military Academy, joining in 1833 but resigning the same year. He rejoined in 1834 but was found deficient and had to repead his class once more. In 1836 he resigned again following an incident in which he broke a plate over the head of fellow cadet (and future Confederate general) Jubal Early.Resignation of Cadet Lewis A. Armistead, January 29, 1836, RG 77, E 18, National Archives. Eicher, p. 107, states that he \\"resigned presumably\\" for breaking the plate. Wert, p. 40, and Warner, p. 11, characterize Armistead as being \\"dismissed\\" from the Academy for his action. Poindexter, p. 144 (the source credited by Warner), recalls that Armistead \\"was retired from West Point.\\" He was also having academic difficulties, however, particularly in French (a subject of difficulty for many West Point cadets of that era), and some historians cite academic failure as his true reason for leaving the academy.Johnson, p. 78. His influential father managed to obtain for his son a second lieutenant's commission in the 6th U.S. Infantry on July 10, 1839, at roughly the time his classmates graduated. He was promoted to first lieutenant on March 30, 1844. Armistead's first marriage was to Cecelia Lee Love, a distant cousin of Robert E. Lee, in 1844.Krick, pp. 104-05. Krick, one of the foremost historians of the Army of Northern Virginia, does not acknowledge multiple marriages. He states that Cecilia (his spelling) died on August 3, 1855, at Fort Riley, Kansas, during a cholera epidemic. They had two children: Walker Keith Armistead and Flora Lee Armistead. Armistead then served in Fort Towson, Oklahoma, Fort Washita near the Oklahoma border. Serving in the Mexican War, he was appointed brevet captain for Contreras and Churubusco, wounded at Chapultepec, and was appointed a brevet major for Molino del Rey and Chapultepec. Armistead continued in the Army after the Mexican War, assigned in 1849 to recruiting duty in Kentucky, where he was diagnosed with a severe case of erysipelas, but he later recovered. In April 1850, the Armisteads lost their little girl, Flora Love, at Jefferson Barracks. Armistead was posted to Fort Dodge, but in the winter he had to take his wife Cecelia to Mobile, Alabama, where she died December 12, 1850, from an unknown cause. He returned to Fort Dodge. In 1852 the Armistead family home in Virginia burned, destroying nearly everything. Armistead took leave in October 1852 to go home and help his family. While on leave Armistead married his second wife, the widow Cornelia Taliaferro Jamison, in Alexandria, Virginia, on March 17, 1853. They both went west when Armistead returned to duty shortly thereafter. The new Armistead family traveled from post to post in Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas. The couple had one child, Lewis B. Armistead, who died on December 6, 1854, and was also buried at Jefferson Barracks next to Flora Lee Armistead. He was promoted to captain on March 3, 1855.Eicher, p. 107. His second wife, Cornelia Taliaferro Jamison, died on August 3, 1855, at Fort Riley, Kansas, during a cholera epidemic. Between 1855 and 1858 Armistead served at posts on the Smokey Hill River in Kansas Territory, Bent's Fort, Pole Creek, Laramie River, and Republican Fork of the Kansas River in Nebraska Territory. In 1858, his 6th Infantry Regiment was sent as part of the reinforcements sent to Utah in the aftermath of the Utah War. Not being required there, they were sent to California with the intention of sending them on to Washington Territory. However, a Mohave attack on civilians on the Beale Wagon Road diverted his regiment to the southern deserts along the Colorado River to participate in The Mojave Expedition of 1858-59. Lt. Col. William Hoffman, at the head of a column of six companies of infantry, two of dragoons, and some artillery, struggled up the Colorado River from Fort Yuma. On April 23, 1859, Colonel Hoffman dictated a peace to the overawed Mohave chiefs, threatening annihilation to the tribe if they did not cease hostilities, make no opposition to the establishment of posts and roads through their country, and allow travel free from their harassment. Hoffman also took some of their leading men or family members hostage. Afterward he left for San Bernardino, taking most of his force with him; others went down river by steamboat or overland to Fort Tejon. Captain Armistead was left with two infantry companies and the column's artillery to garrison Hoffman's encampment at Beale's Crossing on the east bank of the Colorado River, Camp Colorado. Armistead renamed the post Fort Mojave. In late June 1859 the Mohave hostages escaped from Fort Yuma. Trouble broke out with the Mohave a few weeks later when they stole stock from a mail station that had been established two miles south of Fort Mojave, and attacked it. Mohaves tore up melons planted by the soldiers near the fort, and the soldiers shot a Mohave who was working in a garden. Eventually after a few weeks of aggressive patrolling and skirmishes, Armistead attacked the Mohave who returned fire in a battle between about 50 soldiers and 200 Mohave, resulting in three soldiers wounded. Twenty-three Mohave bodies were found but more were killed and wounded and removed by the Mohave. Following this defeat, the Mohave made a peace, which they kept from then on.Krick, p. 110; \\"The Native Americans of Joshua Tree National Park: An Ethnographic Overview and Assessment Study/\\" Cultural Systems Research, Inc., August 22, 2002, VII.

When the Civil War began, Captain Armistead was in command of the small garrison at the New San Diego Depot in San Diego, which was occupied in 1860. He was a close friend of Winfield Scott Hancock, serving with him as a quartermaster in Los Angeles, California, before the Civil War. Accounts say that in a farewell party before leaving to join the Confederate army, Armistead told Hancock, \\"Goodbye; you can never know what this has cost me.\\"Krick, p. 110. When the war started, Armistead departed from California to Texas with the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles, then traveled east and received a commission as a major, but was quickly promoted to colonel of the 57th Virginia Infantry regiment. He served in the western part of Virginia, but soon returned to the east and the Army of Northern Virginia. He fought as a brigade commander at Seven Pines, and then under General Robert E. Lee in the Seven Days Battles (where he was chosen to spearhead the bloody assault on Malvern Hill), and Second Bull Run. At Antietam, he served as Lee's provost marshal, a frustrating job due to the high levels of desertion that plagued the army in that campaign. Then he was under command in the division of Maj. Gen. George Pickett at Fredericksburg. Because he was with Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps near Norfolk, Virginia, in the spring of 1863, he missed the Battle of Chancellorsville. In the Battle of Gettysburg, Armistead's brigade arrived the evening of July 2, 1863. Armistead was mortally wounded the next day while leading his brigade towards the center of the Union line in Pickett's Charge. Armistead led his brigade from the front, waving his hat from the tip of his saber, and reached the stone wall at the \\"Angle\\", which served as the charge's objective. The brigade got farther in the charge than any other, an event sometimes known as the High Water Mark of the Confederacy, but it was quickly overwhelmed by a Union counterattack. Armistead was shot three times just after crossing the wall. Union Captain Henry H. Bingham received Armistead's personal effects and carried the news to Union Major General Winfield Hancock, Armistead's friend from before the war.Halleran, Michael A. The Better Angels of Our Nature: Freemasonry in the American Civil War. Tuscaloosa: The University of Alabama Press, 2010. . pp. 26‚Äì30 Armistead's wounds were not believed to be mortal; he had been shot in the fleshy part of the arm and below the knee, and according to the surgeon who tended him, none of the wounds caused bone, artery, or nerve damage.Armistead's Death, article at Gettysburg Discussion Group by Bryan Meyer. He was then taken to a Union field hospital at the George Spangler FarmHenry Bishop, Sr. sold the property in 1848 to George Spangler. At the time of the sale the farm consisted of some 80 acres. Spangler lived on the property for fifty-six years and died in his 88th year in the home in 1904. where he died two days later. Dr. Daniel Brinton, the chief surgeon at the Union hospital there, had expected Armistead to survive because he characterized the two bullet wounds as not of a \\"serious character.\\" He wrote that the death \\"was not from his wounds directly, but from secondary bacterium, fever and prostration.\\"Smith, pp. 174-75. Lewis Armistead is buried next to his uncle, Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead, commander of the garrison of Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore, at the Old Saint Paul's Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.Poindexter, pp. 144, 150. In popular media In Gettysburg, the film version of Michael Shaara's novel The Killer Angels, Armistead was portrayed by actor Richard Jordan, who died shortly afterwards. In the film, the meeting between Armistead and Bingham at the High Water Mark was altered with Lt. Thomas Chamberlain (portrayed by C. Thomas Howell), brother of Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, taking Bingham's place. In the movie, Armistead was shot in the chest. Actor John Prosky depicted Armistead for a special appearance in Gods and Generals, accompanying Pickett at Fredericksburg. Armistead is a character in the alternate history novel Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War (2003) by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen.

Players control a starship named the Silver Hawk in its mission to destroy the Belser empire before they wipe out the planet Darius. Its gameplay involves traversing through a series of scrolling levels while destroying enemies and collecting power-up icons. It is notable for its unique three- screen panoramic display. The game was designed by a small team of others lead by Junji Yarita. In contrast to other similar games, which feature mechanical or insect-like enemies, Darius uses aquatic creatures like fish and crabs for its enemies and screen-filling bosses. Its large arcade cabinet, based on Taito's earlier panoramic display game Laser Grand Prix (1983), was designed to provide a cinematic atmosphere and stand out from other games at the time. The soundtrack was created by Taito's \\"house band\\" Zuntata, the majority being composed through a combination of FM synthesis and sampling. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. Darius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen is three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet uses an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward- firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run. Development Darius was designed by Junji Yarita, with assistance by planner Akira Fujita and programmer Toru Sugawara. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Fujita was interested in creating a shoot'em up game where the player fought a huge battleship at the end of each stage ‚Äî as a way to \\"spice things up\\" and make it stand out among other similar games, Fujita made the bosses themed around fish and other aquatic creatures. Yarita designed these battleships and created a total of 26 different designs, however time constraints only allowed the development team to use 11 of them in the final game. A single boss took roughly ten days to create. Some of the unused designs made it onto the game's promotional material, which was attributed to the art being outsourced to a different company. Darius cabinets use mirrors on the sides of the center monitor to reflect monitors below. The arcade cabinet, designed by Natsuki Hirosawa, uses three individual monitors made to appear seamless via mirror effects. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). The idea was previously used in Taito's earlier games Wyvern F-O and Super Dead Heat, and was added to give the game a more cinematic presentation and to make it feel more unique compared to other shooting games on the market. A headphone jack and volume dials are also present, as is a speaker system installed beneath the player's seat, which is referred to by Taito as a \\"body sonic\\" system. This concept was originally meant to be used for the 1983 game Laser Grand Prix, however proved too costly and was scrapped. The enemy names were derived from different types of medicine, alongside names of people within the company spelled backwards. Fujita worked on the stage designs and power-ups himself, which he stated was one of the biggest challenges during development ‚Äî ship upgrades were originally in the form of small pod-like craft that orbited the player, however Fujita disliked this idea and cut it from the game. The game's soundtrack was composed by Hisayoshi Ogura, the founder of Taito's \\"house band\\" Zuntata. Ogura wanted the music to convey a sense of a deep, expanded universe, and to make it stand out among other shoot'em up games at the time. Much of the music was composed via a combination of FM synthesis and sampling, while some was made by the Yokosuka Symphony orchestra group. The song \\"Captain Neo\\", used in the game's first zone, was originally used as the main theme for Taito's earlier arcade game Metal Soldier Isaac II, used as a placeholder track during its presentation at tradeshows ‚Äî Ogura liked the track for its sense of \\"overwhelming power\\", and decided to keep it in the final version. Release Darius was released for arcades in Japan in February 1987, and in North America later that year. Three PC Engine ports were produced by NEC Avenue for the Japanese market in 1990. Super Darius was released for the CD-ROM¬≤ System add-on on March 16, followed by Darius Plus as an 8-Megabit HuCard version on September 21. Darius Plus is the only commercially-released HuCard that has enhanced support for the PC Engine SuperGrafx. A third version, Darius Alpha, was released as a sweepstakes giveaway and was limited to only 800 copies. Darius Alpha is an alternate version of Darius Plus where the player fights only the bosses. Like Darius Plus, it has enhanced support for the SuperGrafx. All three PC Engine versions were developed by Bits Laboratory. During the same year, a home computer version of the game titled Darius+ (unrelated to the similarly-titled PC Engine port) was published by The Edge and developed by Softek for the Amiga, Atari ST and ZX Spectrum in Europe. In 2002, PCCW ported the game to the Game Boy Advance in Japan as Darius R. In August 2016 the original arcade version was re-released for PlayStation 4 in Japan and other Asian PS-Stores. The port was made by Hamster Corporation and is part of the Arcade Archives on PlayStation 4. Darius R, a remake of the first Darius game with some different tunes and a fewer number of stages, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. While never originally ported to the Sega Genesis, a port of the game by M2 is featured on the Sega Genesis Mini microconsole. An expanded version titled Darius Extra Version will be released for the Sega Mega Drive. Reception In April 1987, Game Machine listed Darius as being the most popular upright arcade unit in Japan at the time.

He is a centuries-old vampire portrayed by Mark Metcalf, determined to open the portal to hell below Sunnydale High School in the fictional town of Sunnydale where the main character Buffy Summers lives. The premise of the series is that Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a Slayer, a teenage girl endowed with superhuman strength and other powers which she uses to kill vampires and other evil beings. Each season of the series Buffy and the small group of family and friends who work with her, nicknamed the Scooby Gang, must defeat an evil force referred to as the Big Bad; the villain is usually trying to bring on an apocalypse. The Master is the first season's Big Bad. The Master is the head of an ancient order of vampires, a classic Old World villain devoted to ritual and prophecy. He has been entombed beneath Sunnydale for 60 years as the patriarch of a cult posed opposite Buffy, a character who was created to subvert media tropes about frail women falling victim to evil characters. Her youth and insistence on asserting her free will makes her unique in the Master's experience, but he is devoted to fulfilling a prophecy that states he will kill the Slayer and initiate the extermination of all humanity. Creation and casting Buffy the Vampire Slayer was originally conceived for a 1992 feature film that pitched Buffy against a similar villain controlling vampires below Los Angeles. Disappointed by the final film, screenwriter and series creator Joss Whedon reworked his script into a television series more in line with his original vision. He and the staff writers employ horror elements in the series to represent real-life conflicts for the adolescent characters, while frequently undercutting the horror aspect of the show with comedy. Sunnydale High School is situated atop a portal to hell called a Hellmouth, which Whedon uses to symbolize the high-school-as-hell experience.Tracy, pp. 6‚Äì37. Pragmatically, Whedon admitted that placing the high school on a Hellmouth allows the writers to confront the main characters with an endless array of evil creatures.Whedon, Joss (2008). Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete First Season; \\"Interview with Joss Whedon: Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" Featurette. [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Veteran character actor Mark Metcalf appeared in heavy prosthetic make-up for the role of the Master, belying his iconic performance in the film National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) as Douglas C. Neidermeyer, a strident rule-following ROTC officer (and the associated role in Twisted Sister's \\"We're Not Going to Take It\\" music video). In 2011, Metcalf acknowledged that his Animal House role would probably live much longer than he, but also recognized his roles on Seinfeld‚Äîwhere he plays a similarly named character called \\"Maestro\\"‚Äîand Buffy the Vampire Slayer as his favorites.Andrews, Tom (October 28, 2011). 'Animal House' Fan Favorite Metcalf Still Crafting Film and Stage Memories, FoxPoint-Bayside Patch. Retrieved on November 20, 2011. Many actors auditioned for the part, but Metcalf, according to Whedon, played it with more complexity, bringing a \\"sly and kind of urbane\\" sensitivity and a charm to the villainy of the character.Whedon, Joss (2008). Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete First Season; \\"DVD Commentary for \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Establishment At the beginning of the series, Buffy has left behind a destructive past that has labeled her as a trouble-maker at school and instilled in her the fear that the actions she has had to take to be a successful Slayer are responsible for breaking apart her parents' marriage. She arrives at Sunnydale High School believing that she has made a fresh start. Her mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) is unaware of her daughter's vocation and stresses that Buffy's time in Sunnydale should be as peaceful as possible. When Buffy arrives in the school library, however, she finds that the new librarian, Giles (Anthony Head), is expecting her and ready to continue her training. His expectation that she is there to take up her role as Slayer upsets her; she wants nothing to do with him or with Slaying. Giles is, in fact, Buffy's new Watcher, a mentor who will teach her about the demons she must face, as well as supervise her training in weapons and battle strategy. Although she desperately desires to be a mere high school student, she is unsuccessful in avoiding her destiny to fight vampires. On her first day she finds a vampire's victim at school, and resumes her work as the Slayer.Kaveny, p. 14.Stafford, pp. 2‚Äì6.Golden and Holder, pp. 2‚Äì5. Because it debuted midway through the 1996‚Äì97 television season, the first season of Buffy has only 12 episodes as opposed to the standard 22 in subsequent seasons. The Master is first seen in the series premiere \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", which was aired immediately before the second episode \\"The Harvest\\", which reveals more of the Master's character and backstory. Although the Master's identity is never revealed on screen, Joss Whedon wrote in the pilot's script that his name was Heinrich Joseph Nest, roughly 600 years old. This contradicts information presented in the first season that indicates The Master predates written history, as is discussed below. In \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" the Master is presented as one of the \\"old ones,\\" a vampire with extraordinary physical and mental powers, but weakened through long isolation and needing to feed on people; he is raised from a pool of blood by his acolyte Luke (Brian Thompson). The head of a cult called the Order of Aurelius, the Master attempted to open the Hellmouth in 1937, placing himself in a church to do so. An earthquake swallowed the church during the Master's attempt, and he has been living in the ruins for 60 years.Stafford, pp. 124‚Äì128. He is imprisoned by a mystical force, unable to leave his underground lair, so he commands his minions to find people for him to feed off. The Master's incarceration underground was a device used by the writers to avoid having Buffy meet him and then thwart his attempts to kill her each week. Whedon was concerned that audiences would consider this implausible and that weekly confrontations would leave no tension for the season finale when Buffy and the Master would finally meet and battle each other.Whedon, Joss (2008). Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete First Season; \\"DVD Commentary for \\"The Harvest\\" [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In \\"The Harvest\\", employing a ritualized dark ceremony which can be used only once in a century, the Master makes Luke his \\"vessel\\": every time Luke feeds, power will be transmitted to the Master.Golden and Holder, pp. 54‚Äì56. Luke goes to The Bronze, the local nightclub frequented by Buffy and her friends and begins to feed on the patrons before Buffy ‚Äî following a delay caused by getting grounded by her mother ‚Äî can kill him. Although Luke successfully feeds on a couple of victims, Buffy stakes him, thereby leaving the Master contained, robbed of his proxy, and with insufficient power to break the mystic shield that confines him underground . The majority of vampires on the series have a human face that can turn into what Whedon and the characters call \\"vamp face\\". When shown immediately before feeding, the vampire characters transform with prosthetic make-up and computer-generated effects, giving them prominent brows and cheekbones, sharpened yellow teeth, and yellow eyes. Whedon intended to use the vamp face to be able to place vampires around Buffy in different locations ‚Äî especially at school ‚Äî to highlight the element of surprise by illustrating that the characters often face friends and peers who appear normal, but have dark sides. Simultaneously, the vamp face shows that Buffy is killing monsters instead of people. Whedon made a decision to have the Master in permanent vamp face to indicate that he is so ancient he predates humanity. The Master never shows a human face; the make-up specialist conceived him as bat-like, intentionally making him look more like an animal. His facial make- up, bald head, extremely long fingernails, and black costume all refer directly to the 1922 German Expressionist film Nosferatu, directed by F. W. Murnau. Like the vampire of that film, Count Orlok, the Master lives in a state of furious isolation from which he is desperate to escape. According to author Matthew Pateman, the Master's presentation underscores both his great age and his European-ness ‚Äî he is emphatically Old World. Even so, as a result of his entrapment in the New World, he adapts and shows himself able to incorporate American technology into his plans.Pateman, pp. 104‚Äì105. He also (perhaps anachronistically) speaks with a modern American accent. Religiosity In \\"Never Kill a Boy on the First Date\\" the Master reads from a formally written Bible-like book of prophecy that foretells the arrival of a powerful warrior enigmatically named \\"The Anointed One\\" (Andrew J. Ferchland) who will become the Master's \\"greatest weapon against the Slayer\\". The Master sends other acolytes of the Order of Aurelius to bring The Anointed to him, instructing them to give their lives should it become necessary for them to succeed. When Buffy finally encounters him in the season finale, The Anointed One turns out to inhabit the body of a little boy.Tracy, pp. 149‚Äì152.Stafford, pp. 132‚Äì133. The Master instructs the boy in the influence of fear (\\"Nightmares\\") and power (\\"Angel\\"). Buffy studies scholars have noted the role religion plays in the series, and have commented on the Master's sense of religiosity in particular. With the exception of Angel (David Boreanaz), none of the main characters exhibit any prominent religious views although they observe some religious holidays. Several of the villains in the series, however, are nearly fanatical about religious ritual and custom, the first of which is the Master.Stevenon, pp. 66‚Äì68. The rituals the Master performs to make Luke his vessel are, according to Wendy Love Anderson, an \\"inversion of Christianity\\". The Master attempts to restore the \\"old ones\\" and aligns himself with a child while setting up Buffy to be a Christ-like figure.South, pp. 214‚Äì215. He foretells that when he is able to leave his mystical prison, \\"the stars themselves will hide\\", an aberration of a line from John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost, where Satan is musing on his own power.Dial-Driver, pp. 145‚Äì147. The Master's entombment in a house of worship is a convenient vehicle to introduce the character's religiosity, but it also represents the way evil is at times allowed to thrive in churches.The Master's entombment also recalls Jewish apocalypse stories which can be found in the Book of Enoch. (Stevenson p. 66‚Äì68.) The unChristian symbolism was intentional on Whedon's part, as he was cautious about including such subversive imagery in \\"The Harvest\\"; Buffy producer David Greenwalt was certain Christian groups would protest the ceremonial aspects of the plot. Gregory Erickson notes that the Master's denigration of a Christian cross, what he calls the \\"two pieces of wood\\" even while being burned by it, reflects the series' treatment of Christianity overall and in turn, the American simplification of religion. On Buffy, a cross is a weapon, but beyond that is an empty symbol. Christian symbols and rituals traditionally play an integral role in many vampire stories, as in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Conversely, Buffy downplays their importance.Wilcox and Lavery, pp. 108‚Äì115 Demise The Master sends minions to kill Buffy in \\"Angel\\", an episode featuring the origin story of Buffy's romantic interest, a vampire with a murderous past who was re-ensouled by a Gypsy tribe as the ultimate punishment; this \\"curse\\" has caused him to feel remorse and live the past century in misery and torment. His desire for redemption, as well as his attraction to Buffy, compels him to assist her. She discovers he is a vampire in \\"Angel\\" and it is revealed that one of the Master's most powerful followers, Darla (Julie Benz), was the vampire who transformed Angel and was his lover for several generations. After the Master allows Darla to destroy the minions who failed to kill Buffy, Darla tries to lure Angel to the Master's side, but Angel stakes and kills her, further thwarting the Master's plans.Stafford, pp. 135‚Äì137.Golden and Holder, pp. 64‚Äì65. Buffy and the Master finally meet in the season finale \\"Prophecy Girl\\", in which Giles translates a prophecy that states that if she fights the Master, she will die. Buffy overhears Giles discussing it with Angel and tells Giles she refuses to be the Slayer if it means she will die, then begs her mother to go away with her for the weekend. After five students are murdered by more of the Master's followers, however, Buffy decides she must fight the Master and is led to his underground lair by The Anointed One; she is wearing a long white dress, bought for a dance she was supposed to attend instead. He quickly hypnotizes her and tells her that \\"prophecies are tricky things\\" that don't reveal all: had she not come to fight him, he could not rise, as it is her blood which will free him. He bites and drinks from her, then tosses her to the ground face-down in a shallow pool where she drowns. Angel and Buffy's friend Xander (Nicholas Brendon), who have disobeyed her wishes and followed her, arrive after the Master has risen. Xander is able to revive Buffy through CPR, thus the prophecy of her death at the Master's hands is fulfilled, but its intention thwarted. She becomes stronger as a result of their encounter.Golden and Holder, pp. 78‚Äì80. An extension of the Master's religiosity is his preoccupation with prophecies. The themes of the first season are destiny and forming an identity separate from childhood: breaking the illusions that the world is safe and actions have no real consequences.Stevenson, pp. 47‚Äì48.Kaveney, pp. 19‚Äì20. Destiny is repeatedly a theme between Buffy and the Master. The entire first season is underscored with prophecies ‚Äî a narrative device used less frequently in later seasons of the series ‚Äî that Buffy neglects to fulfill in various ways. Buffy often has prophetic dreams and the Master is nearly obsessed with recounting and confirming written prophecies.South, pp. 221‚Äì222. Buffy's superhuman powers are her birthright. Despite her desire to live a normal life she feels compelled to fulfill her destiny as a Slayer, and the need for her to live up to this responsibility is reinforced by Giles. Buffy, however, subverts these elements to assert her own free will, which is illustrated in the season finale. According to Buffy studies scholar Gregory Stevenson, the Master has such confidence in the prophecy that the Slayer will die that he is unable to comprehend her resurrection by Xander.Stevenson, pp. 71‚Äì74. When the Master rises, the Hellmouth opens in the floor of the school library where Giles, Buffy's friends Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and a teacher, Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte) are present and fighting off the emerging monsters. Buffy finds the Master on the roof of the library watching through the octagonal windows in the ceiling. Incredulous upon her arrival, he tells her she was destined to die in a written prophecy. She replies \\"What can I say? I flunked the written.\\" She is now able to resist his attempts to hypnotize her and pushes him through the skylight into the library below, impaling him on a broken wooden table and killing him.Stafford, pp. 145‚Äì147. Later appearances Following his death, the Master makes several appearances in the series, and his presence is still palpable in early second season episodes. In the second season premiere Buffy has still not exorcised the trauma she experienced in her confrontation with the Master, and is masking her anxiety by being hostile towards her friends. She has her catharsis by smashing his bones with a sledgehammer.Golden and Holder, pp. 82‚Äì83.Stafford, pp. 147‚Äì148. The Anointed One remains alive until killed by a vampire named Spike (James Marsters) in \\"School Hard\\". In the third season, \\"The Wish\\" presents audiences with an alternate reality in Sunnydale: after dating Xander and breaking up, Cordelia expresses to Anyanka (Emma Caulfield), a vengeance demon, a wish to live in a Sunnydale where Buffy never arrived. In this reality the town is overrun with vampires loyal to the successfully risen Master who, in a capitalistic turn, has devised a machine to make an assembly line to bleed humans to feed his followers, thereby freeing them of the need to hunt humans. In this Sunnydale, very powerful vampires Willow and Xander are his favorites. Near the end of the episode a very different Buffy arrives, friendless and fighting alone, and when she confronts the Master she falls quickly under his hypnotic powers and is killed when he snaps her neck (again fulfilling the prophecy that in their fight, she will die).Holder, et al, pp. 159‚Äì161.Wilcox and Lavery, pp. 101‚Äì102.Stafford, pp. 195‚Äì197. In the seventh season premiere of Buffy, \\"Lessons\\", the Master appears once more as a face of the First Evil, a shape-shifting villain and the Big Bad of the final season.Ruditis, pp. 167‚Äì170. Metcalf also guest-starred on the Buffy spinoff series Angel in the second season episode \\"Darla\\", which goes into more detail about Darla's human life and her transformation into a vampire at the Master's hands.Holder, et al (2002), pp. 251‚Äì259. In the canonical comic book series, it is revealed that the Master has been resurrected off-screen by the Seed of Wonder as its guardian at some point after the first season's finale. He is eventually killed again by a far more powerful rogue higher power, Twilight. The Master appears in the first Buffy video game, where he is resurrected by a necromancer as a spirit to act as the leader for the Old One Lybach's plot to build a bridge between his Hell dimension and Earth and lead an army of demons to Earth. The Master possesses Angel and uses the remnants of the Order of Aurelias and demons loyal to him to try to build the bridge. He is eventually exorcised from Angel by Buffy and Willow but survives in spirit form to continue on. After Buffy kills the Dreamers, the demons he's using to build the bridge, her friends perform a spell to make him corporeal and she is able to kill him once again. Influence Joss Whedon created Buffy Summers to subvert the dual ideas of female subordination to patriarchy, and authority steeped in tradition, both dynamics well-established in the Master's world order. According to Buffy scholars, the Master is a classic villain. Rhonda Wilcox writes, \\"There could hardly be a nastier incarnation of the patriarchy than the ancient, ugly vampire Master\\", and Gregory Stevenson places him in the category of \\"absolute evil\\" with the second season's Judge (also Brian Thompson), third season's Mayor (Harry Groener), and fourth season's Adam (George Hertzberg). In contrast, other Buffy characters are more morally ambiguous. The Master is a grand patriarch consumed with hierarchy, order, subservience, and is defined by what is old. Buffy's opposition to the Master addresses media tropes found in many horror films where a young, petite blonde woman, up against a male monster, is killed off partway through the film as a result of her own weakness. The series also highlights the generational divide between the younger characters and the older ones. In particular, the dialogue, termed \\"Buffyspeak\\" by some media, frequently makes the younger characters indecipherable to the older ones.Williamson, pp. 76‚Äì90. The Master speaks with a stylistic formality found in Bible verses. According to Wilcox, Buffy can hardly understand Giles' language, much less the Master's \\"pompous, quasi-religious remarks\\". The entire first season confronts the younger characters with the problems of impending adulthood, which they only begin reconcile in the last episodes of the season.Wilcox, pp. 21‚Äì22, 27‚Äì29.Jowett, p. 168. Each season finale signifies a turning point for the main characters ‚Äî usually Buffy ‚Äî and her confronting the Master, according to Stevenson, represents \\"the end of her childhood illusions of immortality\\".Stevenson, pp. 171‚Äì172. The scene is fraught with romantic imagery, with Buffy in a white gown, initially intended to be her party dress. When the Master bites her it is, according to Elisabeth Kirmmer and Shilpa Raval, her sexual initiation: a different take on the young girl dying at the hands of a monster. Kirmmer and Raval write that the \\"paradigm of Death and the Maiden is replaced by that of the hero who faces death and emerges stronger\\".Wilcox and Lavery, pp. 156‚Äì158 When he tries to hypnotize her on the roof, she is able to resist him and kills him. Buffy's willful behavior and tendency to buck tradition is further underscored by another Slayer who was brought up in the traditional Slayer path by her Watcher. In the mythos of the series, when one Slayer dies, another takes her place somewhere in the world. Buffy's brief death activated the Slayer Kendra (Bianca Lawson) in the second season. She is a committed, rule-abiding young woman who does everything authority figures tell her to do. Thus, she is fatally vulnerable to being hypnotized by Drusilla (Juliet Landau), an insane vampire with extraordinary mental abilities, who kills Kendra easily.Jowett, p. 46.

Haboobs occur regularly in dry land area regions throughout the world.  Description  During thunderstorm formation, winds move in a direction opposite to the storm's travel, and they move from all directions into the thunderstorm. When the storm collapses and begins to release precipitation, wind directions reverse, gusting outward from the storm and generally gusting the strongest in the direction of the storm's travel. When this downdraft of cold air, or downburst, reaches the ground, it blows dry, loose silt and clay (collectively, dust) up from the desert, creating a wall of sediment that precedes the storm cloud. This wall of dust can be up to wide and several kilometers in elevation. At their strongest, haboob winds often travel at , and they may approach with little or no warning. Often rain does not appear at ground level as it evaporates in the hot, dry air (a phenomenon known as virga). The evaporation cools the rushing air even further and accelerates it. Occasionally, when the rain does persist, it can contain a considerable quantity of dust. Severe cases are called mud storms. Eye and respiratory system protection is advisable for anyone who must be outside during a haboob. Moving to shelter is highly advised during a strong event.  Occurrence = Middle East = Haboobs have been observed in the Sahara, Sahel (typically Sudan, where they were named and described), as well as across the Arabian Peninsula, throughout Kuwait, and in the most arid regions of Iraq. Haboob winds in the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Kuwait are frequently created by the collapse of a thunderstorm. = North Africa = African haboobs result from the northward summer shift of the inter-tropical front into North Africa, bringing moisture from the Gulf of Guinea. = Australia = Haboobs in Australia may be frequently associated with cold fronts. The deserts of Central Australia, especially near Alice Springs, are particularly prone to haboobs, with sand and debris reaching several kilometers into the sky and leaving up to of sand in the haboob's path. = North America = As with haboobs in the Middle East, haboob occurrences in North America are often created by the collapse of a thunderstorm. This is a local or mesoscale event, and at times of extreme drought they can originate in agricultural regions. Some of the most famous dust storms of the Dust Bowl and similar conditions later were in fact synoptic scale events typically generated by a strong cold frontal passage, with 14 April 1935, 9‚Äì11 May 1934, 19 February 1954, and 11 November 1911 being particularly vivid examples. The arid and semiarid regions of North America‚Äîin fact, any dry region‚Äîmay experience haboobs. In North America, the most common terms for these events are either dust storm or sandstorm. In the U.S., they frequently occur in the deserts of Arizona, including around the cities of Yuma and Phoenix; in New Mexico, including Albuquerque; in eastern California, and in Texas. They also sometimes occur in the Columbia Basin, of Eastern Washington, almost always leading to an impact with the city of Spokane. If the storms are strong enough, they can reach as far east as Post Falls and Moscow, in North Idaho. = Mars = Global dust storms on Mars have been compared to haboobs on Earth.Boyle, R.

The passaggi (plural) of the voice lie between the different vocal registers, such as the chest voice, where any singer can produce a powerful sound, the middle voice, and the head voice, where a powerful and resonant sound is accessible, but usually only through vocal training. The historic Italian school of singing describes a primo passaggio and a secondo passaggio connected through a zona di passaggio in the male voice and a primo passaggio and secondo passaggio in the female voice. A major goal of classical voice training in classical styles is to maintain an even timbre throughout the passaggio. Through proper training, it is possible to produce a resonant and powerful sound. Vocal registers One cannot adequately discuss the vocal passaggio without having a basic understanding of the different vocal registers. In his book The Principles of Voice Production, Ingo Titze states, \\"The term register has been used to describe perceptually distinct regions of vocal quality that can be maintained over some ranges of pitch and loudness.\\"Ingo R. Titze, The Principles of Voice Production, Second Printing (Iowa City: National Center for Voice and Speech, 2000) 282. When discussing vocal registration, it is important to note that discrepancies in terminology exist between different fields of vocal study, such as teachers and singers, researchers, and clinicians. As Marilee David points out, \\"Voice scientists see registration primarily as acoustic events.\\"Marilee David, The New Voice Pedagogy, 2nd ed. (Lanham, MD: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2008) 59. For singers, it is more common to explain registration events based on the physical sensations they feel when singing. Titze also explains that there are discrepancies in the terminology used to talk about vocal registration between speech pathologists and singing teachers.Ingo R. Titze, The Principles of Voice Production, Second Printing (Iowa City: National Center for Voice and Speech, 2000) 281. Since this article discusses the passaggio, which is a term used by classical singers, the registers will be discussed as they are in the field of singing rather than speech pathology and science. Most voices can be divided roughly into three main registers.Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 115-149. # Head # Middle or mixed # Chest These three main registers are described as having a rich timbre, because of the overtones due to the Sympathetic resonance within the human body. Their names are derived from the area in which the singer feels these resonant vibration in the body. The chest register, more commonly referred to as the chest voice, is the lowest of the registers. When singing in the chest voice the singer feels sympathetic vibration in the chest. This is the register that people most commonly use while speaking. The middle voice falls in-between the chest voice and head voice. The head register, or the head voice, is the highest of the main vocal registers. When singing in the head voice, the singer may feel sympathetic vibration occurring in the face or another part of the head. Where these registers lie in the voice is dependent on sex and the voice type within each sex. There are an additional two registers called falsetto and flageolet register, which lie above their head register.Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 115-149.Marilee David, The New Voice Pedagogy, 2nd ed. (Lanham, MD: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2008) 63. Training is often required to access the pitches within these registers. Men and women with lower voices rarely sing in these registers. Lower voiced women in particular receive very little if any training in the flageolet register. Men have one more additional register called the strohbass, which lies below the chest voice. Singing in this register is hard on the vocal cords, and therefore, is hardly ever used.Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 125. The transitions between these registers are known as the passaggi. Register ranges=Male voices= Here are the register ranges offered by Richard Miller for a lyric tenor:Richard Miller, Training Tenor Voices (New York: Schirmer Books, 1993) 7. *Strohbass ‚Äì F2 to C3 *Chest ‚Äì C3 to G3 *Middle (or mixed) ‚Äì G3 to G4 Lower Middle ‚Äì G3 to D4 Upper Middle ‚Äì D4 to G4 *Head ‚Äì G4 to C5 *Falsetto ‚Äì C5 to F5 Miller describes the lower middle voice as being made up of a mixture of predominantly chest voice with a small amount of head voice. The upper middle he describes as a mixture of predominantly head voice with a small amount of chest voice.Richard Miller, Training Tenor Voices (New York: Schirmer Books, 1993) 7. This concept holds true for all voice types both male and female. Men have 3 registers separated by 2 passaggi. Each register‚Äôs image and shape can be expressed with the shape of a V. (3 V‚Äôs, or a double hour glass are acceptable images). Men have 2 passaggi for open vowels and one passaggio for closed vowels. Tenor voices are the highest of the male voice types, with the exception of the countertenor voice, which makes much greater use of the falsetto register. Baritones are the next lowest voice after tenors, and they are followed by bass-baritones, and then basses. As a result of their lower voices, the ranges for these parts will be lower than that of the ranges listed for tenor above. Richard Miller does not provide a breakdown of registers for the three lower voice parts in his book Securing Baritone, Bass-Baritone, and Bass Voices or in his book The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique, nor does he give any indication of their overall ranges capabilities. Oxford Music Online states the range a baritone will typically sing in an opera is A to F#.\\"Baritone,\\" in Oxford Music Online (Oxford University Press, 2014), accessed December 7, 2014, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e846?q=baritone&search;=quick&pos;=2&_start=1#firsthit. They do not indicate which A or F-sharp; however, it can be assumed, since a baritone's range is lower than that of a tenor, that the A is A2 and the F# is F#4. Baritones are capable of reaching notes higher than F#4 and lower than A2. The same is true of Oxford Music Online's proposed range for bass voices, which it lists are E to E or F.\\"Basso,\\" in Oxford Music Online (Oxford University Press, 2014), accessed December 7, 2014, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e923 The first E is probably referring to E2 and the second as E4 or F4. =Female voices= The register ranges for a \\"generic soprano voice\\", as given by Richard Miller in Training Soprano Voices, are as follows:Richard Miller, Training Soprano Voices (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000) 117. *Chest ‚Äì G3 to Eb4 *Middle (or mixed) ‚Äì Eb4 to F#5 Lower Middle ‚Äì Eb4 to C#5 Upper Middle ‚Äì C#5 to F#5 *Head ‚Äì F#5 to C6 or C#6 *Flageolet ‚Äì D6 or D#6 to the \\"highest negotiable pitches\\" The register ranges for a mezzo-soprano voice are as follows:Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 135. *Chest ‚Äì E3 or F3 to E4 or F4 *Middle (or mixed) ‚Äì C4 to E5 or F5 Lower Middle ‚Äì C4 to Bb4 or B4 Upper Middle ‚Äì B4 to E5 or F5 *Head ‚Äì F5 or F#5 to Bb5 or B5 *Flageolet ‚Äì C6 and up The register ranges for a contralto voice are as follows:Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 135. *Chest ‚Äì D3 to G4 or Ab4 *Middle (or mixed) ‚Äì F4 to D5 Lower Middle ‚Äì F4 to A4 Upper Middle ‚Äì Bb4 to D5 *Head ‚Äì Eb5 to Ab5 *Flageolet ‚Äì A5 The difference between ranges for different female voice types are relatively small, but it is these small differences that often determine a singer's voice type. There are some areas where the registers appear to overlap. The notes in these areas can be sung in either the chest voice or the middle voice, depending on the singer. This requires training and control. It is better to sing these notes with a mixture of chest voice and head voice. Bringing the chest voice up too far can be very damaging to the female voice.Marilee David, The New Voice Pedagogy, 2nd ed. (Lanham, MD: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2008) 65. Where the main register changes occur are the notes of the passaggi. = Voice types and passaggi= The transitions between the registers are known as the passaggi in classical singing. There are several other common names for the passaggio. \\"Lift\\" is a word used in some schools of voice training to describe the passaggio.Richard Miller, Training Soprano Voices (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000) 119. One of the most common terms for the passaggio is the \\"break.\\" Marilee David in her book The New Voice Pedagogy explains, \\"The area where the voice must change registers are often called breaks because the untrained voice appears to break into a new type of production. This break is a sudden gap in sound which occurs when the thyroarytenoid muscles suddenly decrease their activity and the cricothyroid muscles begin to function. A skillful transition of this muscular activity is one of the marks of the trained singer.\\"Marilee David, The New Voice Pedagogy, 2nd ed. (Lanham, MD: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2008) 70. David does a wonderful job describing the science behind passaggio, however the term \\"break\\", while used frequently during commercial styles of singing, such as pop, rock, country, etc., is usually avoided in classical training. As Miller states, \\"Register terminology should be carefully chosen. 'Breaks' and 'lifts' may well refer to existing register phenomena in a voice, but psychologically they tend to point up the division between registers rather than their unification.\\"Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 115. Lucero et al. have proposed another theory for the production of voice breaks in terms of the acoustic interaction between the vocal fold oscillation and the vocal tract resonances (formant). The interaction may cause frequency and amplitude jumps when the fundamental frequency of the oscillation or a harmonics crosses through a formant. The occurrence of such jumps depends on the cross-sectional area of the epilarynx, which couples the larynx to the downstream vocal tract, and is facilitated by a narrower area. Voice Specialist Ingo Titze explains, \\"Register changes may occur voluntarily or involuntarily.\\"Ingo R. Titze, The Principles of Voice Production, Second Printing (Iowa City: National Center for Voice and Speech, 2000) 282. For all singers, mainly classical, negotiating the passaggi can be difficult and can take years to learn how to accomplish well. Classical voice training aims to provide the singer with the tools necessary to move through the passaggi so that the transition between registers sounds seamless and will be unrecognizable to the audience. In his many books on developing the different male and female voice types, Richard Miller gives many exercises for developing the registers and the transitions between them.  Male voices  In Richard Miller's The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique, Miller identifies the male vocal passaggi as follows:Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 116. # The primo passaggio # The secondo passaggio # The zona di passaggio The primo passaggio is the first register transition. In the male voice Miller indicates that this passaggio occurs between the lower middle register, which is a mixture of predominantly chest voice and some head voice, and the upper middle register, which is a mixture of predominantly head voice and some chest voice.Richard Miller, Training Tenor Voices (New York: Schirmer Books, 1993) 7. It is important to note that the primo passaggio is not agreed upon by all voice specialists. As James Stark notes in Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy, \\"Richard Miller, who visited numerous Italian voice studios, describes male voices as having a primo passaggio and a secondo passaggio, with a zona di passaggio between them. However, he cites not published literature regarding this theory, and most written sources discuss only one passaggio in male voices... and two passaggi in females (one between chest and middle, and one between middle and head registers).\\"James Stark, Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy (Buffalo: University of Toronto Press, 2003) 83. While the number of passaggi in men appears up for debate, most everyone seems to agree on the existence of at least one passaggio. The most often discussed passaggio in published works is what Miller calls the secondo passaggio, which lies between the upper middle voice and the head voice.Richard Miller, Training Tenor Voices (New York: Schirmer Books, 1993) 7. Because of the discrepancy surrounding the primo passaggio, Miller's zona di passaggio is also up for debate. Miller describes the zona di passaggio as the area between the primo passaggio and the secondo passaggio, which he says is an area that needs to be negotiated carefully.Richard Miller, Training Tenor Voices (New York: Schirmer Books, 1993) 7. Here are the passaggi for tenor voices, as proposed by Miller:Richard Miller, Training Tenor Voices (New York: Schirmer Books, 1993) 9-13. *Tenorino: Primo passaggio ‚Äì E4 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì A4 *Tenore leggiero (tenore di grazia): Primo passaggio ‚Äì Eb4 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì Ab4 *Spieltenor: Primo passaggio ‚Äì Eb4 or D4 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì Ab4 or G4 *Tenore lirico: Primo passaggio ‚Äì D4 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì G4 *Tenore lirico spinto: Primo passaggio ‚Äì C#4 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì F#4 *Tenore robusto, tenore drammatico: Primo passaggio ‚Äì C4 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì F4 *Heldentenor: Primo passaggio ‚Äì C4 or Bb3 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì F4 or Eb4 Here are the passaggi for baritone, bass-baritone, and bass voices, as proposed by Miller:Richard Miller, Securing Baritone, Bass-Baritone, and Bass Voices (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008) 9. *Lyric baritone: Primo passaggio ‚Äì B3 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì E4 *Dramatic (Verdi) baritone: Primo passaggio ‚Äì Bb3 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì Eb4 *Bass-baritone: Primo passaggio ‚Äì A3 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì D4 *Lyric bass: Primo passaggio ‚Äì Ab3 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì Db4 *Basso profondo: Primo passaggio ‚Äì G3 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì C4  Female voices  In the same book, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique, Miller identifies the female vocal passaggi as follows:Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 134-135. # The primo passaggio # The secondo passaggio Unlike the male passaggi, the two female passaggi are widely agreed upon. In his book The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique, Miller also posits, \\"Many sopranos experience an additional pivotal point midway in the long middle register around C-sharp5 with lower-middle register lying below that pitch, and upper-middle register lying above it.\\"Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 142. Here are the passaggi for female voices, as proposed by Miller:Richard Miller, The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique (New York: Schirmer Books: A Division of Macmillan, Inc., 1986) 134-135. *Soprano: Primo passaggio ‚Äì G4 or Ab4 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì F#5 *Mezzo-soprano: Primo passaggio ‚Äì E4 or F4 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì E5 or F5 *Contralto: Primo passaggio ‚Äì Eb4 Secondo passaggio ‚Äì D5 References Notes Sources *Owen Jander, et al. \\"Soprano.\\" Grove Music Online.

Smith says people are being delivered from phobias, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder, dissociative personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sexual addiction, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and homosexuality through Theophostic principles. The name Theophostic is a registered trademark.Business Information paragraph on About Us page of www.theophostic.com Few empirical evaluations of Theophostic ministry are available, although Christian psychologist Fernando Garzon says that current case study and survey data has yielded clinically significant changes in client symptom levels, and high degrees of client and practitioner satisfaction.\\"Cognitive restructuring through contemplative inner healing prayer. VISTAS: Perspectives on Counseling American Counseling Association Press, Garzon, F. (2004).]  Definition  Smith's definition of Theophostic Prayer Ministry is that \\"Theophostic is a ministry of helping emotionally wounded people to acknowledge and to identify the true source of their inner emotional pain and find lasting peace through receiving personalized truth directly from the Lord.\\"Smith, Ed M. Freedom from Performance-based Spirituality, DVD, Theophostic Prayer Ministry (2004)  The Theophostic Prayer Ministry process  Participants in a typical Theophostic Prayer Ministry session are the ministry recipient, a ministry facilitator and optionally a prayer partner.Smith 2007, p.82, 202. The ministry facilitator ensures that the ministry recipient understands the process before the session begins.Garzon, Fernando, Psy.D., Editor (2008). Pursuing Peace ‚Äì Case Studies Exploring the Effectiveness of Theophostic Prayer Ministry, p. 59. Xulon Press. .Smith 2007, p.88 The facilitator begins the session with a prayer of encouragement.Smith 2007, p.93, 225 The ministry recipient closes his eyes and concentrates on feeling the emotional pain from which he is seeking relief. The purpose of focusing on the emotion is to allow his mind to drift back to a related memory.\\"Theophostic Prayer Ministry (Part One) ‚Äì Christian Prayer, Occult Visualization, or Secular Psychotherapy?\\", Christian Research Journal, volume 29, number 3 (2006). That memory is of a situation that the recipient regards as painful and which he has interpreted to form a belief about himself or his situation. The event that is contained in the memory may have occurred many years ago, for example in the person's childhood. The emotion provides a bridge to the belief.Smith, Edward M. (2007). Theophostic Prayer Ministry, Basic Training Seminar 2007, DVD Sessions, Disk 1, New Creation Publishing. The ministry recipient describes the memory to the facilitator. The facilitator asks the recipient some questions that will enable the recipient to drill down to the core belief housed in this memory that is troubling him. The questions are not leading questions,Smith, Edward M. Healing Life's Hurts through Theophostic Prayer, Theophostic Prayer Ministry Guidelines, p. 256, New Creation Publishing (2002, 2005) as the facilitator does not assume anything about the memory's content. Rather they are open questions, posed to help the recipient himself to identify the core belief. This core belief is known in TPM parlance as a \\"lie\\" that causes lie-based pain. The lie arises from the recipient's interpretation of the situation.Smith, Edward M. Healing Life's Hurts through Theophostic Prayer, p. 145, New Creation Publishing (2002, 2005) For example, a rape victim may have formed a belief that she is dirty or shameful, whereas she was actually an innocent victim. Though her belief is false, it has the same impact on her emotional state now as if it were true.Smith 2007, p.19 Once the recipient has identified the core troublesome belief, the facilitator prays, asking Jesus to provide the recipient with his perspective, that is, what he would like the recipient to know. According to TPM, Jesus answers that prayer in various ways. He might provide his truth to the recipient by means of a mental picture, a feeling, a scripture, a word, a realization or some other way. The truth received from Jesus replaces the painful lie previously believed, and the result is peace.Smith 2007, p.23Garzon 2008, p. 77 TPM says that every person believes not just one, but many lies of the kind that lead to present emotional pain. Each lie can be eliminated with the same process.  Research  In his 2008 book,Garzon 2008 Fernando Garzon, an associate professor in the Center for Counselling and Family Studies at Liberty University,Garzon 2008, p. 94 describes his team's two-year-long outcomes-based case study research project that evaluated TPM. The research team found very clear preliminary results that showed a correlation between TPM treatment and symptom reductions.Garzon 2008, p. 93 Garzon wrote that the case studies strongly support the need for randomized comparative or control group studies. Garzon had conducted preliminary practitioner studies in 2001 which showed promise, concluding that \\"...outcome-based case studies and randomized clinical trials should proceed on TPM to ascertain whether the therapeutic perception of efficacy displayed in this survey actually has merit...\\" He also found that a wide variety of people were practicing Theophostic ministry at that time, including pastors, lay counselors, and psychologists. According to Garzon, this raised questions about some practitioners' level of training.  Controversy  A Kentucky journalist has associated Theophostic Prayer Ministry with Recovered Memory Therapy, an approach now widely discredited after discovery of false memory phenomena on the basis that Theophostic Prayer Ministry also presupposes the possibility of repression or memory inhibition,\\"Controversial international ministry operates from Campbellsville\\" ‚Äì Central Kentucky News Journal, July 2, 2003 by Jan Fletcher A critical entry from Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance also associates Theophostic ministry with Recovered Memory Therapy, although the article does not identify the aspects of Theophostic Prayer Ministry that merit the assertion. It also claims that Theophostic Prayer Ministry has added beliefs about demonic possession, Satanic influence, direct communication with \\"Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit\\" and \\"unique concepts about the inner workings of the mind\\". However, Smith himself strongly repudiates Recovered Memory Therapy,Smith 2007, p.215 and in recent years he has taught that it is counter-productive to pursue or even allow demonic confrontations in a ministry session.Smith 2007, p.124-126 However, in his Basic Training Seminar Manual (and in each of the training videos), Smith warns strongly against making any suggestions that might affect the actual content of a memory,Smith 2007, p.129-133 and he lists ten ways in which TPM differs from RMT.Smith 2007, p.215-218 Nevertheless, once a core belief about self has been identified through the memory (not in the memory per se), Smith does \\"invite the Lord\\" to speak truth to the ministry recipient concerning that belief.Smith 2007, p.106 In an article about TPM in the Christian Research Journal, Elliot Miller said that to accuse TPM of practicing recovered memory therapy and visualization is to betray ignorance or bias against TPM that refuses to be corrected by clear and consistent facts. A Christian psychologist, David Entwistle, has expressed concerns with its practice: \\"TPM follows in the lineage of 'healing of memory' techniques, though it departs from that lineage in a number of important respects. Numerous concerns exist surrounding insufficient attempts to ground TPM in biblical concepts; inadequate and often flawed explanations of basic psychological processes; dubious claims about the prevalence of DID, SRA, and demonic activity; estimates of traumatic abuse that exceed empirical findings; and the failure to sufficiently appreciate the possibility of iatrogenic memory contamination\\". Entwistle raises concern over empirical validity, with questions about literal appearances of God, as Entwistle interprets claimed perceptions of truth, including spontaneous visualizations of Christ; ethical and legal issues relating to guarantees of healing; application of TPM to a variety of mental disorders without empirical validation; the legal question of whether it should be considered a religious intervention or a counseling procedure ‚Äì and whether this was settled by changing the name from Theophostic counseling to Theophostic ministry; and the failure of Smith to welcome public analysis and critique of TPM. In Cumberland, Maine, sexual-abuse charges against ex-member Tom Wright were brought after a church member's memory surfaced during Theophostic sessions of Wright allegedly abusing a child. When the case went to trial in 2002, the charges were thrown out by the district attorney because evidence was based on 'unconventional and biased therapeutic methods'. The district attorney noted that these methods were considered unreliable by the American Psychological Society. In 2006, in Australia, a psychologist was found guilty of malpractice by the Queensland Health Practitioners Tribunal for using Theophostic methods. The tribunal found that Irene Moreau, who practiced from a Christian counselling centre in Brisbane, 'inappropriately used Theophostic Prayer Ministry as a counselling technique'. Practitioners of techniques such as TPM frequently do not have formal training in psychology or counseling, although Fernando Garzon suggests that this in many cases may be beneficial, saying: \\"...it may serve people who might not get help otherwise, cannot afford professional therapy, do not wish to use insurance, or have access to counseling limited by managed care. Others belong to churches in which the pastor is either not trained, not interested, or not available (due to having too many other pastoral duties) to meet the needs for pastoral counseling. Still others simply may trust lay people, whom they know, more than a therapist, whom they do not know. In addition, the training itself may benefit the lay counselors spiritually and emotionally.\\"\\"Lay Christian Counseling and Client Expectations for Integration in Therapy\\", Journal of Psychology and Christianity (in press) Garzon et al, Liberty University In addition to questions about the efficacy, safety and reliability of TPM, it has also divided Christian observers with regard to the soundness of its theology. In the conclusion of their paper \\"A theological analysis of Theophostic Ministry\\", Bryan Maier and Philip Monroe put it this way: \\"...on the issues of sin and healing, the question remains for Christian counselors and the evangelical community as a whole as to whether Smith's 'theological basis' is consistent with responsible biblical doctrine. We do not think that Smith has warrant to make this claim. Furthermore, we think these differences are so significant that we advise great caution before engaging in this ministry ‚Äì whether as a client or as facilitator.\\"  References   Christian movements Counseling ","title":"Theophostic counseling"},{"id":"625919","text":"Kohler Co., founded in 1873 by John Michael Kohler, is an American manufacturing company based in Kohler, Wisconsin. Kohler is best known for its plumbing products, but the company also manufactures furniture, cabinetry, tile, engines, and generators. Destination Kohler also owns various hospitality establishments in the United States and Scotland. In February 2017, Kohler Co. acquired UK-based Clarke Energy from the management team and ECI Partners, a multinational specialist in the engineering, construction, installation and maintenance of engine-based power plants and is an authorised distributor of GE's reciprocating engines in 19 countries worldwide. History Kohler Co. was co-founded in 1873 by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler and Charles Silberzahn with the purchase of the Sheboygan Union Iron and Steel Foundry from Kohler's father-in-law, Jacob Vollrath, for $5000. Early products included cast iron and steel farm implements, castings for furniture factories, and ornamental iron pieces including cemetery crosses and settees. A breakthrough came in 1883 when John Michael applied enamel to a cast-iron horse trough to create the company's first bathtub. The company has been primarily in the plumbing business ever since, and is known for its plumbing fixtures. In the early 20th century, Kohler made drinking fountains with a \\"bubbling valve\\", from which water shot vertically. Eventually the entire fountain came to be known as a \\"bubbler\\" in the area in which Kohler products were sold. The term bubbler is still used in a few areas of Wisconsin and some other areas of the United States.Beth Dippel. \\"Debunking the the bubbler myth\\". Sheboygan Press, October 31, 2014. Accessed July 3, 2016.Center for the Study of Upper Midwestern Cultures. \\"Wisconsin Englishes: Words\\" . In 1934 and 1954, Kohler Strikes took place. A third strike took place in 1983 and lasted only a few weeks. On November 15, 2015, workers voted for the 2015 Kohler Strike, making it the fourth strike in the company's history. =Corporate management history= Former Wisconsin Governor Walter J. Kohler, Sr. was president of Kohler Co. and his son former Wisconsin Governor Walter J. Kohler, Jr. served for many years in senior management. The presidency of Kohler was passed down from Herbert Kohler, Jr. (born February 20, 1939, grandson of the founder), to his son, David Kohler, on June 1, 2015. In 1998, Kohler made a plan to buy back any outstanding shares not owned by the family. All family members had to exchange their common shares for shares with limited rights that could not be sold. Since Kohler is not a publicly traded company, the number of shares floating was minimal. Kohler offered $55,400 per share, but some shareholders challenged this valuation and sued. The IRS also challenged this valuation by prosecuting the estate of Frederick Kohler, who had recently died holding 975 shares, but Kohler won the lawsuit. = Hiring practices = In 1999, a court case was brought by the United States Department of Labor alleging that Kohler Co.'s hiring practices were discriminatory to women. The company had an informal height requirement of for women, which is the average adult female height in the United States.Anthropometric Reference Data for Children and Adults 2003‚Äì2006 Because of its contracts with the federal government, the company was prohibited from enforcing this requirement and as part of a settlement agreed to hire 111 of the 2,000 women who had applied to work at Kohler from 1994 to 1995 and to undertake a study \\"to eliminate unnecessary barriers to women\\". = Working conditions = In 2005, China Labor Watch accused Kohler China (Investment) Co., Ltd. of major worker rights violation at its Foshan factory. These included: excessive work hours, lack of overtime pay, low wage payment, unsafe working conditions, uncompensated work injuries, and denying workers the ability to form their own union. = Controversy = In January 2020, Kohler paid $20 million in a settlement with the US Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency and the state of California over its small engines' violations of the Clean Air Act and California law. Products Kohler \\"Bardon\\" urinals Power generator GS 400 produced by SDMO Industries Kohler Design Center Kohler's bath and kitchen fixtures are available in American hardware and home improvement stores and from Kohler Kitchen and Bath distributors. Kohler still makes traditional cast iron bathtubs, one of the few United States manufacturers to do so. Besides residential products, Kohler manufactures a commercial line of bathroom fixtures. The company also does artistic custom work, such as hand-painted sinks and toilets. In 2015 Kohler was named by Builder magazine as the \\"most used\\" and \\"best quality\\" in the \\"Bath Accessories\\" category as well as the top spot for \\"brand familiarity\\", \\"most used\\" and \\"quality rating\\" in the \\"Bath Fixtures\\" and \\"Whirlpool Baths\\" categories. The Kohler Walk-In Bath Division designs, engineers and builds accessible bathtubs that are easier to enter than traditional bathtub models. The division specializes in bathing products for people with limited mobility or who are disabled. Founded in 2015, this specialty division sells its bathtubs through independent dealers across the United States. Kohler also makes a wide range of small industrial engines. Traditionally, the company manufactured gasoline engines; however, after purchasing the Italian company Lombardini, it extended its range and now offers diesel engines up to 134 HP. Kohler engines power a range of devices from water pumps to off-road vehicles. The Global Power group manufactures generators of varying sizes. Kohler was the first company to offer residential back-up generators, starting in 1920. In 1984 Kohler acquired Sterling Faucet Company. The company was renamed as Sterling Plumbing Group Inc. The Sterling brand was integrated into Kohler family of products. Kohler later expanded the offering of Sterling products adding to the faucet line, shower doors, sinks, toilets, and other bathroom accessories. In 2007, Kohler created a joint venture in China called Kohler- YinXiang Ltd., based in Chongqing, China, to manufacture small gasoline engines, and intends to begin importing more of their engines, rather than building them in the US. Kohler's UK subsidiary is the Cheltenham-based Kohler Mira Ltd, best known for manufacturing Mira Showers. Since then, the company has been expanding in the areas of furniture, cabinetry, and tile in the consumer market, and engines and generators for industry. The Kohler Interiors division of the company comprises Baker Furniture, McGuire Furniture, Kallista, Ann Sacks Tile and Mark David. Kohler displays many of its products at the Kohler Design Center in the village of Kohler. At CES 2018 Kohler unveiled a new product line called Kohler Konnect, consisting of smart connected plumbing fixtures including bathtubs, mirrors, shower heads, toilets, and shower valves.

The league lasted for 6 weeks and was used to charge its founders Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman with conspiracy to obstruct the draft. Formation The No Conscription League in the United States was founded by anarchist Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman in 1917 in response to the draft in World War I. The draft was enforced by the Selective Service Act of 1917, which granted the federal government the right to raise a national army. The league viewed the draft as a destroyer of the freedom to ethical and political choice granted by the constitution of the United States. The members of the league strongly opposed government-enforced conscription; they saw it as a violation of the liberty of American people. This oppression was justified by Woodrow Wilson's Espionage Act of 1917, which prohibited any action that would interfere with the US military or government affairs. Many were prosecuted under this act, including those in the No Conscription League. Those charged were fined a maximum of 10,000 dollars and were sentenced to up to 20 years of imprisonment.Hawkins, James R. \\"Encyclopedia of the Supreme Court of the United States.\\" Free Speech and World War I. Vol. 2. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. 285‚Äì92. Print. Manifesto Emma Goldman and the members of her league published a piece of literature known as the No Conscription League manifesto. This document goes into great detail about the freedoms of Americans, and how the government was oppressing citizens' certain unalienable rights. Goldman urges the nation for support and promotes the need to protect and fight for one's liberty as a citizen. This pamphlet went into circulation with over 100,000 printed,\\"FEDERAL AGENTS WATCH ANTI-DRAFT.\\" The New York Times - Breaking News, World News & Multimedia. 31 May 1917.

The following is the platform on which the league was founded, taken from the manifesto itself: Gatherings Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman held a mass No Conscription League meeting on 4 June 1917. In addition to Goldman and Berkman, speakers included Louis Baury, \\"Mother\\" Yusher, Stella Comyn Ballantine, Leonard D. Abbott, Katia Siebel, and Rose Yuster. After the meeting, police asked to see the selective service enrollment cards of many participants; many did not have these cards and were detained and taken to jail. There was much fear, due to governmental restrictions such as the Espionage Act. Government pesponse Due to the mass number of publications of the manifesto, the government retaliated against people who were in opposition to the draft. Anti-draft meetings were forbidden, and those speaking out against the draft were to be arrested. In response to the 4 June 1917 mass meeting, Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were arrested with bail set at $25,000 each. According to the PBS time line on Emma Goldman regarding her arrest, \\"Berkman and Goldman were found guilty of conspiracy against the selective draft law in New York City.

A member of the Liberal Party, he served as a member of the Australian House of Representatives representing the Division of Blair from 1998 until 2007. Early life Thompson was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, and was a radio journalist, as well as press secretary and chief of staff to several state and territory politicians in Queensland and the Northern Territory before entering politics. Election to parliament Thompson was preselected for the new division of Blair for the 1998 election. Considerable press at the time focussed on the contest, as the redistribution creating the seat had split One Nation leader Pauline Hanson's seat of Oxley in half. A Labor-friendly section around Brisbane remained in Oxley, while a more rural section became Blair. Hanson opted to contest Blair, which contained most of her former base. After election day, the contest was noted for being one of only ten occasions where a candidate who did not finish first or second went on to win under Australia's instant-runoff voting system. Thompson finished third on the first count, behind Hanson and Labor's Virginia Clarke. However, the major parties all preferenced each other ahead of Hanson, allowing Thompson to pull ahead of Clarke on National preferences. On the eighth count, Thompson picked up three-fourths of Clarke's preferences, enough for him to win the two party preferred vote against Hanson. Thompson's ousting of Hanson from Federal Parliament was to be his only claim to political fame. The Goodna Bypass Thompson led a proposal to construct a bypass east of the city of Ipswich, known as the Goodna Bypass and connecting Dinmore to the Logan Motorway, in preference to a six-lane upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. In pursuit of the bypass, he encountered opposition from leaders within his own party including Queensland's state Liberal leader Dr Bruce Flegg and Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. After a set of feasibility studies and options reports, the federal government announced funding for the A$2.3 billion Goodna Bypass. By July, the cost had increased to $2.8 billion. As the 2007 election approached, Thompson campaigned almost solely on the Goodna Bypass, which Labor had said they would not build if they won government. However, a redistribution pushed Blair further into Ipswich. The new territory was significantly pro-Labor and cut Thompson's majority in half, from a relatively safe 11.2 percent to a marginal 5.7 percent‚Äîputting it just outside the range of seats Labor would need to take off the Coalition in order to win government. Together with a strong swing in Queensland towards the Labor Party, this resulted in Thompson's defeat by Labor candidate Shayne Neumann, with a two party preferred swing of 10.17%‚Äîsignificantly over the Queensland average swing of 7.53%. Post-parliamentary life Thompson became a senior adviser to state National leader Lawrence Springborg and temporarily vacated that position to contest the state Liberal presidency against his federal parliamentary colleague Mal Brough and sitting Liberal Party president Gary Spence on a platform of merging the Liberal and National parties. In 2010, he was unsuccessful in getting the endorsement of the newly merged Liberal National Party of Queensland to be the party's candidate for the Division of Wright.

Background After Keller made the TV movie Skeleton Key, he met Natalie Babbitt at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. He liked her novel Tuck Everlasting and decided to produce and direct a film based on it. Filming was done in 1980 and the film was released on June 6, 1981. The film is not well known, as most people associate Tuck Everlasting with the book or the 2002 film. However, the film can be found on VHS and rarely on DVD. It used to air occasionally on television. Plot The story involves the Tucks, a family who drank from a magic spring from the Fosters' little forest and became immortal (hence the name \\"Tuck Everlasting\\"). During an autumn harvest carnival in the fictional town of Treegap at the turn of the century, somewhere in upstate New York, a young man named Jesse Tuck (Paul Flessa), who is immortal, is riding on the Ferris wheel where he works. He decides to show off to the crowd by doing dangerous stunts. People begin to notice, including a man in a yellow suit. The man who runs the Ferris wheel stops its motor, causing it to stop spinning, which leaves Jesse on top. A constable threatens to charge the man if the boy gets hurt. Jesse begins doing dangerous stunts which frightens the crowd. The Ferris wheel's brake fails and when somebody bumps into it, it causes the wheel to turn, causing Jesse to fall to the ground, causing people to think he is dead. After sitting, Jesse opens his eyes and jumps up, scaring the crowd. Angered the constable runs after Jesse. Meanwhile, a very, bored 12-year-old girl Winifred Foster (Margaret Chamberlain) is sitting on her front lawn. She is so bored that she begins talking to a turtle which goes waddling by. She tells the turtle how much she hates it at home, and that she is not allowed to go to the fair. Two boys talking about Jesse are walking by. After talking to the turtle her mother and Grandmother call her in for lunch and then to practice piano. She says goodbye to the turtle as it goes to hide in a bush. The next scene shows the Tucks at their pond on the other side of the wood, at their brown one- story house. Mae Tuck (Sonia Raimi) is talking to Angus Tuck (Fred A. Keller) but is called \\"Angus\\" only a couple of times throughout the whole movie. He is simply known as \\"Tuck,\\" or \\"Mister Tuck.\\" She asks him why he isn't waking up as it is already mid-morning. He says he likes sleeping as he dreams about he and his family are in heaven and never knew about Treegap. But she tells him he has to wake up to get the area ready as they will be having their ten-year reunion with their boys, Jesse and Miles, and that nothing is going to change. Still asleep, he tells her to put her shawl away as the weather hasn't changed. Tuck warns her about going into town or the woods. But she says otherwise. She then asks Tuck to fix her music box even though she is leaving in a few hours. He makes up excuses not to fix it but he agrees to fix it when she's back. She says she promised to keep it going as long as she lived. After Tuck asks what the boys have been doing, she then turns to talking about how fast time flies. And states 10 years is \\"as long as it takes to make a pot of coffee.\\" She is on her horse in the late afternoon admiring the mountains and grasslands and cornfields of the upper New York countryside. The next scene shows a large beech tree with twisty branches. At the bottom of the trunk, underneath an opening, is a small bubbling spring less than a foot wide. Meanwhile, Winnie is allowed outside again, as her mom practices piano. She swings on her swing, which resembles a noose. She then looks at the bush the turtle hides in, and notices it covered with fireflies. She manages to catch one. The man in the yellow suit (James McGuire), the same man from the fair. He greets her and starts asking questions about fireflies but it then turns to questions about her personal life after she loses the firefly. After asking her if they have lived there long, she responds, they lived there forever. Her grandmother notices the man and comes out and asks the man what he is doing on their property. She hears the sound of Mae's music box but she's certain it's elves that live in the woods and come out every 10 years. It's bedtime and Winnie is listening to her Grandmother telling Winnie's parents that it's the elves but her parents object. Father, Mr. Foster (Marvin Macnow) tells the Grandmother to cut it out because he doesn't want Winnie in the woods due to a murder which occurred there. The next morning, Winnie's mother chases a bunch of rabbits away from her raspberry bush. The milk float for the town comes to their house. Winnie takes her chance to escape while mother and the milkman are talking about the elves and Tom Sullivan (the man who killed his wife in the wood.) She doesn't know that the man is watching her, as he had been hiding there overnight. She runs to the entrance of the wood and then walks slowly and admires the wildlife running around and listens to the birds chirp. She notices the large beech tree, and she sees Jesse in one of the branches. He notices her staring and jumps down. He then starts drinking out of that little spring under it. He notices a feather and picks it up. They notice each other and they begin talking, when Winnie wants a drink, he keeps pulling her back from it. After she asks how old he is, he says 104, but then says he's 17. She feels the water, noticing that it's clean and cold, but he interrupts saying it's terrible, and keeps her from drinking. She tries to drink it but he pulls her back and helps her climb the tree, as it's nice and cool. Mae is coming, with Miles, and still playing the music box. She recognizes it from that night. She says it's elf music but Jesse tells her it's just their mom. Winnie's Grandmother is not to far behind, so they grab Winnie and take her to their place. On the way there is the same man, but holding a pistol. Only Winnie knows the man exists, and so he starts asking the Tucks questions. He says the gun doesn't work and fires it at Miles. They both claim it was just a misfire even though he actually shot Miles. The man lies saying it's only a blank. On the way there, after crossing a bridgeless river, Miles carries her across and Jesse shows off his immortality by jumping into a deep part of the river. After she begins panicking when he doesn't surface, Jesse scares her by putting his hand on her shoulder. Unknown to them, but the man was watching the whole entire time. They go to the Tucks house where Tuck is outside working on his wooden horses. Tuck is surprised to see her and offers her to go swimming with the boys, which angers Mae. Winnie enjoys watching them play in the pond. Jesse tries to get Winnie to get into the water by splashing water. While Jesse and Winnie were playing, Miles, Mae and Tuck became increasingly worried about the man in the yellow suit. Since the Tucks don't have a dining area in their home, they eat supper in their den, Winnie gets lonely and asks to be taken home. They tell her their story. Tuck says that 87 years ago, they came from the east, to find a place to live, and at the time, it was part of a large forest, and after a while of traveling they came to the area which is the now the wood. So they rested by the tree with its knobby roots, they drank the water, even the horse, everybody except the cat, named \\"Ginger.\\" They later developed a farm, and a house, and began living a good life. But then when Jesse was getting rid of some branches but fell out of the tree and it was believed that he broke his neck. And then one night at sunset, hunters saw the house and they shot her, mistaking her for a deer. The bullet when right through and didn't even leave a mark. Tuck got bit by a copperhead, Jesse ate poison mushrooms, and Mae cut herself slicing bread. After making friends, they realized that they were not getting any older. Miles was then more than 40, had a wife and a daughter, but he still looked to be 25. Their friends began to leave them, there was talk of witchcraft and black magic. They were forced to leave the farm but later went back and they noticed the tree and the spring. The tree hadn't grown one width since they saw it, and realized it must've been the spring. Tuck then demonstrates b melting a spoon in a fireplace using his bare hand and making a ring out of it. Early the next morning, Tuck takes Winnie out on a rowboat out on the pond and tells her the dangers of selling the water, as somebody will most likely make it into a business, and just that little spring could create a world war. Meanwhile, the man is riding on the Tuck's horse to Winnie's house. While Tuck is giving good advice, he is interrupted when Miles yells that the horse had been stolen. They believe the man stole it, they ask Winnie and she tells them about the man asking questions and coming to her house but she couldn't finish as she begins crying into Tuck's chest while he hugged her. Tuck says, \\"I forgot what it was like being scared.\\" Mae is up in the attic area where doves live, and so she \\"uncorks the bender.\\" Music begins to play and they dance around. Meanwhile, the man rides Tuck's horse to the Fosters house where he makes a deal where he'll find Winnie with the constable and look for her if they give him the wood. They don't know why he wants it. Back at the Tucks, Winnie and Mae talk about Jesse and they have a \\"woman to woman\\" talk. Later that night, as Winnie's sleeping on the couch, Jesse wants her to drink the water when she's 17 so they can be with each other forever. That night, the man and the constable are riding on different horses, the constable decides to stop and let his horse rest, the man decides to go on farther. The constable tells the man not to do anything. A bit later, Winnie is sleeping when she hears a noise and gets scared when woken up. She asks if it's Jesse when it's actually Mae again. Mae says, \\"No, he's asleep, but dreaming of you I bet.\\" Mae hums Hush, Little Baby to her. The next morning there is a layer of snow on the ground. At breakfast time, Tuck begins to mention his concerns about the horse. Miles couldn't get any fish for flapjacks as the pond is too icy. Jesse comes down for breakfast and Tuck asks Winnie if she wants to come home but the man interrupts them, breaking the constable's promise. He tells about how he was a little kid and was told tales about a family that would never die. Afterward. he pulls out his old pistol and pulls Winnie outside, threatening to make her drink the water and use her as a circus show and make the water a business, which Tuck warned about. He puts the gun to Winnie's head and threatens to kill her when Tuck comes with his double-barreled shotgun and shoots the man in the spine send him flying off of the hill and landing on a branch. The constable surprises them, and introduces himself as \\"Constable Thomas.\\" Tuck is arrested and put in the town jail. If the man survives, Tuck will be free, if he dies, then he will be sentenced to death by hanging. The next day Winnie is back home but is only sitting sadly on her swing. They believe she's in shock and think she had a horrible experience. The next morning, the milk wagon comes, and the milkman says the man died that night, and Tuck will be hung. As the carriage is leaving, Jesse jumps off the back, and when Winnie tells him, Jesse says they will break Tuck out of jail at Midnight. That night, the grandfather clock chimes 12 and Jesse comes through the back window. They jump out of the window and run by foot to the sheriffs, using an ear of corn as a torch. They use Roman candles and firecrackers to distract the constable, as he deals with a group of teenagers who he believes are lynchers while the Tucks are busy at work. They replace Tuck with Winnie and they all say goodbye to her. The next morning Winnie's father is directing her home and then they both apologize to each other. They notice a group of boys who Winnie becomes friends with later on. Back at home, Winnie is a few years older, and her grandmother is on her last legs, as all she's doing is sitting and knitting. The doorbell rings and a salesman is selling turtles for stew, Winnie notices one of the turtles and realizes that it's her turtle. She gets to keep it but the man warns her that if he finds it again, it will be made into stew. Winnie upset, runs upstairs to her room. Winnie, a teenager now is in a dry cornfield talking to the turtle, she still has a bottle of the spring water that Jesse gave to her and pours it all over the turtle, but then she realizes that if they do try to kill it and it doesn't work, then they'll wonder, so she puts it into the woods and hides it. There is an epilogue at the end. It's the late 1970s and Mae and Tuck are driving a Late 1960s Chevy C/K and they are saddened and also surprised how much changed over the years. They decide to stop and ask where Winnie could. They drive through the modern day Treegap and stop at a diner and grab a coffee. They ask the waitress behind the counter about the wood, she tells them that lightning destroyed the whole forest and was replaced by a bunch of houses. The waitress asks a customer who says last he heard when one of the sons became elected to Congress. They find a cemetery and find out that Winnie died in 1976. While sad that she had passed away, they were glad that she didn't drink the water. Jesse's working back at the carnival, now modern and meets a girl on a carousel named Katheryn Foster, most likely Winnie's granddaughter. Mae and Tuck get back into their truck when Tuck notices the turtle. He moves it while saying, \\"Darn fool thing thinks it's gonna live forever.\\" The movie ends with the truck driving away back east never to return. The last shot shows Winnie's turtle, watching the cars pass as the credits roll. Cast *Margaret Chamberlain ‚Äì Winnie Foster *Paul Flessa ‚Äì Jesse Tuck *Fred A.

The Patea River flows through the town from the north-east and into the South Taranaki Bight. In the 2013 census, the population was 1,098 people, a decrease of 42 people since the 2006 Census. History and culture=European settlement= Patea, called Carlyle or Carlyle Beach for a time by European settlers, was originally nearer the Patea River mouth than the present town. During the New Zealand Wars Patea was an important military settlement. General Cameron's force arrived at the river mouth on 15 January 1865 and constructed redbouts on both sides of the river.South Taranaki District Council Heritage files (Local Government Historical Body) Patea became a market town when hostilities ended. The first of the sections on the present town site were sold in 1870. A local shipping company was established in 1872, and harbour improvements began. The Marton-New Plymouth railway line via Patea was completed in March 1885. The Carlyle Town Board, created about 1877 to administer town affairs, was succeeded by a borough council constituted on 13 October 1881 under the name Patea.Historical Settlements: From Whanganui to New Plymouth‚ÄîN.J Taniwha‚ÄîWanganui‚Äîsummary 2001 1st year 1997 subm.

The Grader Cool Store received cheese for grading from all over South Taranaki and as far south as Oroua Downs near Himatangi. After grading it was loaded into coastal ships at the grader wharf for transport to Wellington where it was transhipped into overseas ships for export. The port closed in July 1959. =Patea Freezing Works= In the early 1880s the predecessor to the Patea Freezing Works was established on the eastern bank of the Patea River. Cool stores for handling dairy produce followed in 1901 with later additions evolving into what became known as the Patea Freezing Co-Op, South Taranaki's primary employer. Strategic reforms, inefficiencies and nationwide over-processing resulted in closure in September 1982. In February 2008 the derelict buildings suffered severe fires. The damage was extensive and with the health hazard presented by asbestos insulation throughout the freezer walls, the town sought demolition. =Patea MƒÅori Club= Patea became known in 1984 as the home of singer Dalvanius Prime and the Patea MƒÅori Club. Their single, \\"Poi E\\", indicated renewed impetus in contemporary MƒÅori popular music. =Recent history= Patea has retained a strong community focus and enjoys many services including a well-resourced medical centre, public swimming pool and trust-owned rest home. The town is also the location of Aotea Utanganui - Museum of South Taranaki. The breakwaters at Patea were started in 1878 and are being refurbished by the South Taranaki District Council.

He was the Country Liberal Party member for Solomon in the Australian House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007, and then served in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly as the member for Fong Lim from 2008 to 2016. He was the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory under chief minister Adam Giles from 2013 to 2014. Tollner was born in Biloela, Queensland, and worked as a manager and company director before entering politics. He contested the 1997 territory election as an independent, narrowly losing to CLP candidate Chris Lugg in the seat of Nelson. He subsequently won the new federal seat of Solomon for the CLP at the 2001 federal election, and was re-elected at the 2004 election. He was narrowly defeated by Labor candidate Damian Hale at the 2007 election. Tollner then contested the 2008 territory election, winning the new seat of Fong Lim and defeating Labor minister Matthew Bonson. He was re- elected at the 2012 election, and upon the CLP's victory was appointed Minister for Health, Minister for Alcohol Rehabilitation and Policy, and Minister for Housing. In March 2013, Mills expelled Tollner from his cabinet after a heated disagreement between the two at a party meeting. According to former MLA Daryl Manzie, Tollner swore at Mills and threw a stack of cabinet papers at him before walking out of the room. Tollner was appointed deputy chief minister of the Northern Territory on 13 March 2013. He caused controversy in August 2014 when he referred to the gay son of fellow CLP MP Gary Higgins as a \\"pillow biter\\" and \\"shirt lifter\\".

Despite that, Tollner said a few days later that he wanted to be restored to his former position or he would quit the party, leaving it in a precarious position on the floor of the Legislative Assembly. On 1 September, Chief Minister Adam Giles threw open the leadership and deputy leadership to a party room ballot. Giles was re-elected as CLP leader, and Peter Chandler was voted in as his deputy. A redistribution ahead of the 2016 election all but erased Tollner's majority in Fong Lim, slashing it from a fairly safe 7.3 percent to an extremely marginal 0.2 percent. Tollner tried to transfer to the newly created seat of Spillett, which had absorbed much of the eastern portion of Fong Lim. However, he lost a November 2015 preselection battle to Lia Finocchiaro, the member for neighbouring Drysdale. His senior advisor, Tim Dixon, was pre- selected for Fong Lim, but lost the seat to Labor.

Set in the decadent final days of the Soviet Union, KGB is considered to be quite difficult, even for experienced gamers, since it relies on a real time clock and correct/wrong answers which can end the game immediately or after an event needed to be triggered; also, players may make errors which they will notice only hours later in-game. The game engine, graphics and interface have plenty of similarities with Cryo's Dune. KGB was also released on CD under the title Conspiracy, which included clips of Rukov's father played by Donald Sutherland giving advice. In the CD version, all references to \\"KGB\\" within the game and manual were changed to \\"Conspiracy\\".  Plot  The game is set in the summer of 1991. The protagonist, Captain Maksim Mikahilovich Rukov, recently transferred to the Department P from the GRU after three years' duty, is ordered to investigate possible corruption inside the KGB after a former agent turned private eye was found murdered. However, as the plot progresses, Rukov finds himself investigating a political plot of dangerous proportions. = Main characters = * Captain Maksim Mikhailovich Rukov was born on 12 January 1966 in Sverdlovsk. His parents, Mikhail Stepanovich Rukov and Svetlava Shailova, were killed on 23 May 1983 during an Afghan terrorist attack in Dushanbe (in the Tajik SSR) where his father was on active duty. Rukov learned English, Arabic and Spanish and joined the Spetsnaz as a paratrooper in 1988. The game begins as he makes his first steps in Department P. * Uncle Vanya is the brother of Rukov's father. He was also injured in the attack and uses a wheelchair, but is still able to take care of his nephew. He seems very suspicious of Maks's new employers. (The name \\"Uncle Vanya\\" is a nod to the play of the same name by Anton Chekhov ) * Major Vovlov is Rukov's direct superior at Department P. He is bad-tempered and authoritarian. * Colonel Viktor Galushkin works at Department P. He personally knew Rukov's father and went after his assassins. * Major Radomir Savinkov, also a Department P member, is Rukov's controller in Leningrad. He is highly intelligent. * Colonel Vladimir Kusnetsov is the head of KGB's Department 7 in Leningrad. He is very hostile to Department P. * Captain Piotr Chapkin works at Department 7 with his father-in-law, Colonel Kusnetsov. * Major Grigori Agabekov is second in command at Department 7. He served in Afghanistan. He has a clean record and good reputation. * Nathaniel Greenberg and Carla Wallace are American CIA agents who happen to be working on the same case as Rukov. Reception Computer Gaming World said in February 1993 that KGB \\"was very much in the John le Carr√© mold, with lots of hidden intrigue, deep subterfuge and criss- crossing plot lines.

The magazine praised the game's graphics and \\"unusual feel\\", and concluded that it was \\"an engrossing and atmospheric product with more depth and attention to detail than offered by most of the latest graphic adventures\\". In April 1994 the magazine said of the CD remake, Conspiracy, that although Donald Sutherland's acting was \\"first-rate\\" the addition of his scenes to the original game was \\"a bit strained\\", concluding that \\"The novelty of seeing a Big Screen actor in an adventure game is about the only thing going for it\\".
