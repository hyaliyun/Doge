She is a senior lecturer emerita of mathematics at the University of Michigan, where she taught from 1982 until her retirement in 2006. Education and career Shure did both her undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of Michigan, earning a bachelor's degree in 1958 and a master's degree in 1960. After working as a secondary school teacher for two decades, she returned to Michigan in 1982 as coordinator for mathematics and science in the Coalition for the Use of Learning Skills. She also became a lecturer in mathematics, and later a senior lecturer. Mathematics education At Michigan, she played a key role not just in teaching mathematics, but in training the other instructors and graduate students there to be good teachers of mathematics. Her work on calculus reform began in 1992; it was based in part on the \\"Harvard calculus\\" project led by Andrew M. Gleason, and her instructor training materials have been widely used at other universities. With Gleason and others, she became the author of a widely used precalculus textbook, Functions Modeling Change: A Preparation for Calculus (Wiley, 2000; 5th ed., 2017).

It has a rosette of bluish green leaves at its base and up to twenty two pale green, insect-like flowers with dark reddish to purplish glands on its labellum. Description Arthrochilus prolixus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber which produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It has a rosette of between two and six linear to lance-shaped leaves on a side branch at its base, each leaf long and wide. Between three and twenty two pale green, insect-like flowers long are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is linear, long, about wide and partly wrapped around the base of the column. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped, long, about wide. The petals are linear, about long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals are turned back against the ovary. The labellum is about long, wide on a stalk or \\"claw\\" about long. There is an insect-like callus about long with dark reddish brown, hair-like glands in a central band. The tip of the callus is about wide with shiny black glands. The column is light green to whitish with purplish spots, strongly curved, with two pairs of curved wings. Flowering occurs from December to February. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus prolixus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Wauchope. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (prolixus) is a Latin word meaning \\"stretched out long\\", referring to the long labellum calli. Distribution and habitat The wispy elbow orchid grows with grass and shrubs in forest between Manly in New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland. The largest population is in the Bulahdelah district. One colony has established itself in rotting sawdust at a sawmill. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. prolixus is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

Later, it was edited into an abridged, feature-length film which was released in South Korean cinemas on 8 February 2018, and placed in eleventh place in the box office with KRW 120 million. Outside South Korea Outside South Korea, Mattel is handling sales and distribution of Turning Mecard, as a result of a partnership deal the American company had with Sonokong in 2016; specifically, Choirock (Sonokong's multimedia production arm) granted a worldwide license of Turning Mecard to Mattel, and Mattel acquired a 12% equity stake in Sonokong, becoming the largest shareholder of the South Korean company. Prior to the Mattel deal, Lingdong distributed the toyline within Mainland China under license. Later, Lingdong released a similar toyline named Eonster Hunter to replace Turning Mecard in its line-up. Reception The toyline became a fad in its native South Korea, helping propel Sonokong's stock price from KRW 2,980 to a peak of KRW 8,750 in 2015. The brand accounted for roughly 80% of the company's record-breaking KRW 125 billion revenue that year. However, by 2017 sales for Mecard toys had slowed significantly. Criticism and controversy =Similarities with Bakugan= Sonokong was the distributor and license holder of Bakugan toyline and media franchise within South Korea. Japanese writer worked as the head writer of both Bakugan and Mecard animated series. Spin Master, a Canadian toy company which co-developed Bakugan with Sega Toys in Japan, launched a series of lawsuits against Choirock and Mattel, alleging that the Mecard toys infringe Spin Master's patents related to the Bakugan toys. Spin Master brought the case against Choirock to a court in Mainland China in 2016, but lost in the first trial, and lost again in the second trial in March 2019. Separately, Spin Master sued Mattel (which distributes Mecard toys outside South Korea and Mainland China) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California over the alleged infringement (which the Canadian company confirmed in a press release published on 25 April 2018). This and other lawsuits filed against Mattel in Canada and Mexico are still ongoing as of January 2019. Spin Master's legal actions came as Bakugan is to be given a reboot in 2019, and it follows similar moves made by the Canadian company against Chinese toy manufacturers.

In the 2012‚Äì13 season they went on a 22-match unbeaten run before back-to-back defeats knocked them off their stride. But neither Videoton FC nor MTK Budapest FC could sustain the challenge therefore Gy≈ër could wrap up their fourth title with room to spare. On 22 May 2013, Gy≈ër could have double their success by winning the 2012‚Äì13 Magyar Kupa against Debreceni VSC at the Bozsik Stadion, Budapest.

On 19 December 2013, Pint√©r resigned from his position after he was appointed as the head coach of the Hungarian national football team by the head of the Hungarian Football Federation, S√°ndor Cs√°nyi, in Telki. After the 2014‚Äì15 season, the Hungarian Football Federation relegated Gy≈ër to the Nemzeti Bajnoks√°g III due to financial reasons. The 2015‚Äì16 season would be the first one of Gy≈ër out of the top division. On 21 May 2017, the club won the league and therefore was promoted to the 2017‚Äì18 Nemzeti Bajnoks√°g II.

It is found in Central America and North America. The species name T. aloga was coined by Skinner in 1903. Description Tegrodera aloga is generally about 2 cm long; it has a long, narrow and cylindrical body and a wide head. The beetle is easily recognizable due to its contrasting yellow and red spots found on its black body. The brightness of the spots is due to the cantharidin toxins the beetle carries; this coloration is known as aposematism, and it works as a warning signal to protect itself from predators. It is more common to find these beetles in larger groups rather than individually. Behavior A few adults are nocturnal, but most are diurnal or show no cycle. Since adults are sociable and often highly colored, they tend to be conspicuous. The iron cross beetle love palo verde trees and they usually lay their eggs at the base of the flower buds. The eggs then tend to hatch when the flower bud opens. They pupate in the nest and emerge as adults the next spring. The iron cross beetle like most beetles have sexual reproduction. The species is very gender-scripted, with the male fighting to mate the female. Eggs are laid by the female in protected areas like under stones. Diet Adult iron cross blister beetles eat the flowers of Nama hispidum and Eriastrum spp. Relationship to humans and livestock In Tegrodera aloga, cantharidin is excreted through the leg joints and the antennal pores. It is toxic to humans and can inflict painful and sometimes fatal injury to certain livestock. This chemical, C10H12O4, causes severe skin blisters (dermatosis) within hours after exposure. The insect secretes this substance as a defense mechanism. Crushing the beetle also releases the cantharidin. Cantharidin is a poisonous substance which can prove fatal if ingested. The lethal dose for humans when ingested is 10 mg,or 0.5 mg/kg of a human‚Äôs body weight. The main concern revolves around when the beetle is ingested by livestock, in particular horses. The lethal dose for horses is 1 mg/kg. Iron cross blister beetles are known to be found in horses‚Äô food, especially alfalfa. These beetles are starting to pose a problem for farmers in California due to them being ‚Äúkilled during harvest and incorporated into baled hay, or indirectly by transfer of the hemolymph from crushed beetles onto forage.‚Äù This beetle is also considered beneficial because cantharidin is used in the medical field as a topical medication in the removal of warts, removal of tattoos, and has even been looked into for certain cancer treatments. Its use in the treatment of removing warts has been common for many years, and is still used by dermatologists. References * Blaisdell SR., Frank E. \\"SYNOPSIS OF THE GENUS TEGRODERA.

Genetic studies on Neanderthal ancient DNA became possible in the late 1990s. The Neanderthal genome project, established in 2006, presented the first fully sequenced Neanderthal genome in 2013. Since 2005, evidence for substantial admixture of Neanderthals DNA in modern populations has accumulated. Brahic, Catherine. \\"Humanity's forgotten return to Africa revealed in DNA\\", The New Scientist (February 3, 2014). The divergence time between the Neanderthal and modern human lineages is estimated at between 750,000 and 400,000 years ago. The more recent time depth has been suggested by Endicott et al. (2010)410‚Äì440 ka and Rieux et al. (2014)295‚Äì498 ka. A significantly deeper time of separation, combined with repeated early admixture events, was calculated by Rogers et al. (2017). ; see also: Jordana Cepelewicz, Genetics Spills Secrets From Neanderthals' Lost History, Quanta Magazine, 18 September 2017. \\"The dating of that schism between the Neanderthals and the Denisovans is surprising because previous research had pegged it as much more recent: a 2016 study, for instance, set it at only 450,000 years ago. An earlier separation means we should expect to find many more fossils of both eventually. It also changes the interpretation of some fossils that have been found. Take the large-brained hominid bones belonging to a species called Homo heidelbergensis, which lived in Europe and Asia around 600,000 years ago. Paleoanthropologists have disagreed about how they relate to other human groups, some positing they were ancestors of both modern humans and Neanderthals, others that they were a nonancestral species replaced by the Neanderthals, who spread across Europe.\\" On July 3, 2020, a team reported finding that a major genetic risk factor of the Covid-19 virus was inherited from archaic Neanderthals 60,000 years ago. Genome sequencing In July 2006, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and 454 Life Sciences announced that they would sequence the Neanderthal genome over the next two years. It was hoped the comparison would expand understanding of Neanderthals, as well as the evolution of humans and human brains. In 2008 Richard E. Green et al. from Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, published the full sequence of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and suggested \\"Neanderthals had a long-term effective population size smaller than that of modern humans.\\" In the same publication, it was disclosed by Svante P√§√§bo that in the previous work at the Max Planck Institute, \\"Contamination was indeed an issue,\\" and they eventually realised that 11% of their sample was modern human DNA. Since then, more of the preparation work has been done in clean areas and 4-base pair 'tags' have been added to the DNA as soon as it is extracted so the Neanderthal DNA can be identified. Geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology extracting ancient DNA (2005 photograph) The project first sequenced the entire genome of a Neanderthal in 2013 by extracting it from the phalanx bone of a 50,000-year-old Siberian Neanderthal. Among the genes shown to differ between present-day humans and Neanderthals were RPTN, SPAG17, CAN15, TTF1, and PCD16. A visualisation map of the reference modern-human containing the genome regions with high degree of similarity or with novelty according to a Neanderthal of 50 ka has been built by Pratas et al. Interbreeding with modern humans The question of possible interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans (AMH) had been looked into since the early archaeogenetic studies of the 1990s. In 2006, no evidence for interbreeding had yet been found. In 2009, analysis of about one third of the full genome of the Altai individual was still reported as showing \\"no sign of admixture\\". The variant of microcephalin common outside Africa, which was suggested to be of Neanderthal origin and responsible for rapid brain growth in humans, was not found in Neanderthals. Nor was a very old MAPT variant which is found primarily in Europeans. Positive evidence for admixture was first published in May 2010. Neanderthal-inherited genetic material is found in all non-African populations and was initially reported to comprise 1 to 4 percent of the genome. This fraction was later refined to 1.5 to 2.1 percent. It is estimated that 20 percent of Neanderthal DNA currently survives in modern humans. Modern human genes involved in making keratin, a protein constituent of skin, hair, and nails, have especially high levels of introgression. For example, approximately 66% of East Asians contain a POUF23L variant introgressed from Neanderthals, while 70% of Europeans possess an introgressed allele of BNC2. Neanderthal variants affect the risk of developing several diseases, including lupus, biliary cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, type 2 diabetes, and severe COVID-19. The allele of MC1R which was originally linked to red hair in Neanderthals is not found in Europeans, but is present in Taiwanese Aborigines at a frequency of 70% and at moderately high frequencies in other East Asian populations; hence, there is actually no evidence that Neanderthals had red hair. While interbreeding is viewed as the most parsimonious interpretation of these genetic findings, the 2010 study still could not conclusively rule out an alternative scenario, in which the source population of non-African modern humans was already more closely related to Neanderthals than other Africans were, because of ancient genetic divisions within Africa. Le Moustier Neanderthal skull reconstitution, Neues Museum Berlin Research since 2010 has refined the picture of interbreeding between Neanderthals, Denisovans and anatomically modern humans. Interbreeding appears to have occurred asymmetrically among the ancestors of modern-day humans, and that this is a possible rationale for differing frequencies of Neanderthal-specific DNA in the genomes of modern humans. In Vernot and Akey (2015) concluded that the relatively greater quantity of Neanderthal-specific DNA in the genomes of individuals of East Asian descent (than those of European descent) cannot be explained by differences in selection. They further suggest that \\"two additional demographic models, involving either a second pulse of Neandertal gene flow into the ancestors of East Asians or a dilution of Neandertal lineages in Europeans by admixture with an unknown ancestral population\\" are parsimonious with their data. Similar conclusions were reached by Kim and Lohmueller (2015): \\"It has been hypothesized that the greater proportion of Neandertal ancestry in East Asians than in Europeans is due to the fact that purifying selection is less effective at removing weakly deleterious Neandertal alleles from East Asian populations. Using simulations of a broad range of models of selection and demography, we have shown that this hypothesis cannot account for the higher proportion of Neandertal ancestry in East Asians than in Europeans. Instead, more complex demographic scenarios, most likely involving multiple pulses of Neandertal admixture, are required to explain the data.\\" Khrameeva et al. (2014), a German-Russian- Chinese collaboration, compiled a consensus Neanderthal genome based on the genome of the Altai individual and of three Vindjia individuals. This was compared to a consensus chimpanzee genome as the outgroup and to the genome of eleven modern populations (three African, three East Asian, three European). Beyond confirming the significantly higher similarity to the Neanderthal genome in non-Africans than in Africans, the study also found a difference in the distribution of Neanderthal-derived sites between Europeans and East Asians, suggesting recent evolutionary pressures. Asian populations showed clustering in functional groups related to immune and haematopoietic pathways, while Europeans showed clustering in functional groups related to the lipid catabolic process. \\"Specifically, genes in the LCP [lipid catabolic process] term had the greatest excess of NLS in populations of European descent, with an average NLS frequency of 20.8¬±2.6% versus 5.9¬±0.08% genome wide (two-sided t-test, P<0.0001, n=379 Europeans and n=246 Africans). Further, among examined out-of-Africa human populations, the excess of NLS [Neanderthal-like genomic sites] in LCP genes was only observed in individuals of European descent: the average NLS frequency in Asians is 6.7¬±0.7% in LCP genes versus 6.2¬±0.06% genome wide.\\" . Evidence for AMH admixture to Neanderthals at roughly 100,000 years ago was presented by Kuhlwilm et al. (2016). There have been at least three episodes of interbreeding. The first would have occurred soon after some modern humans left Africa. The second would have occurred after the ancestral Melanesians had branched off‚Äîthese people seem to have thereafter bred with Denisovans. The third would have involved Neanderthals and the ancestors of East Asians only. A 2016 study presented evidence that Neanderthal males might not have had viable male offspring with AMH females. This could explain why no modern man to date has been found with a Neanderthal Y chromosome. A 2018 study concluded that interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans led initially to the exposure of each species to unfamiliar viruses. Later on, the exchange of genes granted resistance to those viruses, too. On July 3, 2020, scientists reported finding that a major genetic risk factor of the Covid-19 virus was inherited from archaic Neanderthals 60,000 years ago. It is estimated that 16% of Europeans and 50% of south Asians have the particular sequence on chromosome III, with 63% of Bangladeshis having these gene sequences. Epigenetics A 2014 study on epigenetics of the Neanderthal published the full DNA methylation of the Neanderthal and the Denisovan. The reconstructed DNA methylation map allowed researchers to assess gene activity levels throughout the Neanderthal genome and compare them to modern humans. One of the major findings focused on the limb morphology of Neanderthals. Gokhman et al. found that changes in the activity levels of the HOX cluster of genes were behind many of the morphological differences between Neanderthals and modern humans, including shorter limbs, curved bones and more.

It has a rosette of bluish green leaves surrounding its base and up to fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers with dark red glands on its labellum. Description Arthrochilus rosulatus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber that produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It has a rosette of between three and four elliptic to lance-shaped leaves surrounding the base of the flowering stem, each leaf long and wide. Between two and fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers long are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is linear to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, about wide and partly wrapped around the base of the column. The lateral sepals are oblong to lance- shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and about wide. The petals are linear, long and wide and curved. The lateral sepals and petals are turned back against the ovary. The labellum is light green with a dark purplish blotch at its base, about long, wide on a short stalk or \\"claw\\". There is an insect-like callus about long with short, reddish brown, hair-like glands in a central band. The tip of the callus is about wide with shiny dark reddish or black glands. The column is translucent with a few purplish spots, curved, and has two pairs of curved wings. Flowering occurs from November to July. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus rosulatus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Rossville. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (rosulatus) is a Latin word meaning \\"of roses\\", referring to the leaf rosette surrounding the base of the flowering stem, contrasting with others in the genus that have them on side growth. Distribution and habitat The rosetted elbow orchid grows in forest in the vicinity of Cooktown, sometimes forming spreading colonies. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. rosulatus is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

He ministered Christ Episcopal Church, as well as serving as rector of Frederick Parish, for four decades, the longest of any rector in the parish. He was married to a cousin of President James Madison, whose marriage to Dolley Payne Todd he would also go on to consecrate. Originally from Scotland, and trained as a Presbyterian, Balmain traveled to Virginia to become teacher to the children of Richard Henry Lee. He was later ordained as a minister and served under the rector of Augusta Parish at Trinity Episcopal Church in Staunton. On the eve of the American Revolutionary War, he chaired the local Committee of Safety and drafted the Augusta Resolves. During the war, he served as a chaplain under Peter Muhlenberg. After the war, he settled in Winchester where he became rector of Frederick Parish, with William Meade as his understudy. Apart from his duties in the clergy, Balmain also helped George Washington map the most convenient route from the Potomac to the Ohio. Balmain's ledger still exists and contains genealogical information from his time, such as marriage and funeral records. Early years Balmain traveled to America to tutor the children of Richard Henry Lee (pictured) Born and raised in Scotland, Balmain went on to study to be a Presbyterian minister at the University of St Andrews, receiving a Master of Arts in 1758.Katherine L.

There he met Arthur Lee, who recommended him as a tutor for the children of his brother, Richard Henry Lee in Westmoreland County, Virginia; Balmain accepted the position and departed for America in 1767.Parish History, p. 42 In 1772, after a brief return to England, he was ordained as a minister, and, in 1773, had become curate to Rev. John Jones, the \\"seriously incapacitated\\" rector of Augusta Parish in Staunton, earning 100 pounds a year. =American Revolution= Balmain served as Peter Muhlenberg's (pictured) chaplain during the American Revolution. On the eve of the American Revolutionary War, Balmain was chair of the Augusta County Committee of Safety.Parish History, p. 43 In \\"the first patriotic meeting of the people of Augusta County\\" on February 22, 1775, Balmain likely wrote the instructions to the delegates of the Colony Convention in Richmond, known as the Augusta freeholders statement or the Augusta Resolves: > \\"Many of us and our forefathers left our native land and explored this once > savage wilderness to enjoy the free exercise of the rights of conscience and > of human nature. These rights we are fully resolved, with our lives and > fortunes, inviolably to preserve, nor will we surrender such inestimable > blessings, the purchase of toil and danger, to any Ministry, to any > Parliament, or any body of men upon earth, by whom we are not represented, > and in whose decisions, therefore, we have no voice.\\" In June 1775, Balmain served on a diplomatic mission to negotiate with Indians at Fort Dunmore (Pittsburgh). By 1777, he was chaplain to the 13th Virginia Regiment of the Continental Army and, on May 22, 1778, became chaplain to Gen. Muhlenberg's Brigade, serving until at least June 1780.Gwathmey, John H.

During the war, Balmain came into contact with James Wood, who would later become governor of Virginia. With the end of the war in 1783, Rev. Balmain settled in Winchester, Virginia, where he served Christ Episcopal Church, as its minister, and also as rector of Frederick Parish. He mentored several clergymen, including parishioner William Meade, who also become a priest and later served as rector of Cunningham Chapel Parish for 27 years as well as becoming the third Episcopal Bishop of Virginia. Balmain also attended the organizational convention of the Diocese of Virginia presided over by Rev. (later Bishop) James Madison.Parish History, p. 48 The state of Virginia later disestablished the Anglican church, although it was re-established as the Episcopal Church at the post war conference but would nonetheless lose its lands. Frederick Parish was one of about a dozen parishes, including outlying ones such as Berryville, to survive disestablishment relatively intact. Balmain lived a frugal life as his primary source of income was a meager military pension for his service during the war supplemented by subscriptions from his parishioners and rent from leases of the glebe lands, which were generally donated to the poor.Meade, Old Families, Vol.I, pp. 36-37 Apart from his religious duties, Balmain also taught, and performed marriages, notably the marriage of James and Dolley Madison at Harewood on September 15, 1794. An unusual exercise of his faith was Balmain's attempt to exorcise the Wizard Clip ghost of Middleway. =Family= According to one account, Balmain came to Winchester \\"in debt and in love\\". In 1786, he married Lucy Taylor (1757-1841), a relative of future presidents James Madison and Zachary Taylor, from Orange County. Alexander Balmain Bruce was named after him. Balmain's sister Margaret married George Bruce. Balmain convinced his nephew John Bruce to immigrate from Scotland. Vestryman Bruce also established the Winchester Academy and helped bring a railroad to Winchester before his death in 1855. John's son was the artist Edward Calledon Bruce. =Death and legacy= Balmain served Frederick Parish for over four decades, the longest of any rector to date, until his much-mourned death in 1821. One of Rev. Balmain's last acts was to help form the Episcopal Society of the Valley, a missionary society for the Shenandoah Valley, in 1820. Rev. Balmain, like his protege Bishop Meade, was highly active in the American Colonization Society. Balmain's last will and testament gave his wife Lucy the power to emancipate their slaves, whom Meade remembered them treating as their children, during her life or as part of her last will.Parish History, pp.70-75 He was buried in the cemetery of the old stone church. When the present brick church was built in 1828, the headstones were installed in the west wall of the nave, where they remain. Balmain kept a large manuscript journal, which still survives, providing much information about the life of a rector in that period. It includes personal and household accounts, those who subscribed to his salary from 1787 to 1797, paid mostly in wood, wool, and beef, the marriages and funerals he conducted, a list of his books, information about his Revolutionary land warrants, prayers, and copied newspaper articles from the politics of the day.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as critically endangered by the Department of Conservation. Taxonomy This species was first described by Alfred Philpott in 1905 as Xanthorhoe imperfecta. Philpott used specimens he collected in the West Plains suburb of Invercargill. In 1971 John S. Dugdale assigned Xanthorhoe imperfecta to the genus Asaphodes. Description Philpott described A. imperfecta as follows: Distribution Asaphodes imperfecta is endemic to New Zealand. The species was regarded as being rare and local to the southern part of the South Island. It is now regarded as being locally extinct in its type locality of Invercargill. George Vernon Hudson mentions that it was also present in Dunedin. Ecology and habitat Adult moths had been collected in forest and Hudson stated the species preferred low lying swampy forest habitat. Hudson also stated that adult moths were on the wing in December and January. Host plants The host plants of this species are unknown. Conservation status This moth is classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Critical. It has been hypothesised that this species is under threat as a likely result of habitat loss, given the drying out of ecosystems as a result of wetland drainage which in turn ensures the land no longer supports the plants the species lives on in its larvae stage.
