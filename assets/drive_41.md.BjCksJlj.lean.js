He played college baseball at the University of Louisville. Duvall was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 11th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. He previously played for the Giants and Cincinnati Reds. He made his MLB debut in 2014. He was an All-Star in 2016. Early life Duvall was raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and played baseball at Butler High School. In his junior high school season, he sustained a cracked vertebra. A subsequent surgery prevented him from playing during his senior year of high school. Duvall went on to play college baseball at Western Kentucky University, Chipola College, and the University of Louisville. Minor leagues Duvall was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 11th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. He signed and made his professional debut that season for the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes. In 54 games, he batted .245 with four home runs and 18 RBIs. He spent 2011 with the Augusta GreenJackets where he slashed .285/.385/.527 with 22 home runs and 87 RBIs in 116 games. In 2012, he played for the San Jose Giants where he batted .258 and led all Class A players with 30 home runs along with 100 RBIs. Duvall spent the 2013 season with the Richmond Flying Squirrels, tallying a .252 average, 17 home runs, and 58 RBIs over 105 games. He was out of the lineup for part of April and May after sustaining an injury to his left thumb. Following the season, Duvall was added to the 40-man roster on November 20, 2013. He started the 2014 season with the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies. Major leagues =San Francisco Giants= Duvall was called up to the majors on June 25, 2014. In his first MLB game, Duvall hit a home run off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Mike Leake, for whom he was later traded. He was sent back down to the Grizzlies on July 4 due to the return of Brandon Belt from the disabled list (DL). When Belt was sent back to the DL due to lingering concussion symptoms, Duvall was called back up to the Giants to play first base, alongside Travis Ishikawa, Buster Posey, and Michael Morse. On September 28, Duvall homered off San Diego Padres pitcher Tim Stauffer for his first career pinch‚Äìhit home run. Over the course of 2014, Duvall played in 28 games with the Giants, finishing with a .192 batting average, three home runs, and five RBIs. The Giants earned a wild card spot with an 88‚Äì74 record and eventually won the 2014 World Series over the Kansas City Royals. Duvall, however, did not make any appearances in the postseason. He began 2015 with the Sacramento River Cats. =Cincinnati Reds= On July 30, 2015, Duvall and Keury Mella were traded to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Mike Leake. Following the trade, Duvall joined the Louisville Bats. On August 31, Duvall was recalled by the Reds to replace an injured Brennan Boesch. As a pinch-hitter, Duvall homered in his first at bat with the Reds. Splitting time between Louisville and Cincinnati, Duvall played in 27 games with the Reds. He posted a .219 batting average, five home runs, and nine RBIs for the Reds. In 2016, Duvall was included on the Reds' opening day roster. By June, he led the NL in slugging percentage and was tied for first in MLB in home runs. He was selected to the 2016 Major League Baseball All- Star Game as a reserve. Duvall was the first University of Louisville alumnus to become an MLB All-Star. He also participated in the 2016 MLB Home Run Derby, losing to 2015 derby champion Todd Frazier in the semifinals. In his first full season in the majors, Duvall played in 150 games and posted a .241 batting average, 33 home runs, and 103 RBI. On April 18, 2017, Duvall hit his first career grand slam off of Kevin Gausman as the Reds won 9‚Äì3 over the Baltimore Orioles. On July 14th, with the bases loaded, Duvall hit his first career walk-off in the 11th inning off of T. J. McFarland of the Diamondbacks to give Cincinnati a 4‚Äì3 victory. Duvall finished 2017 with a .249/.301/.480 slash line to go along with 31 home runs and 99 runs batted in. On May 9, 2018, Duvall hit his first career walk-off home run off A. J. Ramos against the New York Mets to give the Reds a 2-1 victory. =Atlanta Braves= On July 30, 2018, Duvall was traded to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Lucas Sims, Matt Wisler, and Preston Tucker. Duvall struggled in 2018 with the Braves, batting .132 with no home runs or RBIs. In both Atlanta and Cincinnati, Duvall batted just .195 with 15 homers and 61 RBIs. In 2019, Duvall hit .267/.315/.567 with 10 home runs and 19 RBIs in 120 at bats in 41 games for Atlanta. 2020 Duvall and Marcell Ozuna became the first teammates in Major League Baseball history to hit three home runs in consecutive games, when Duvall did so against the Boston Red Sox on September 2, 2020. Ozuna's equivalent feat the previous day was the first time a National League player had hit three home runs in a game at Fenway Park. On September 9, Duvall hit three home runs in a game for the second time, while facing the Miami Marlins. He became the first player in franchise history to have hit three home runs in a game twice. He drove in nine runs, on a two-run home run followed by a three-run home run, then a grand slam. In doing so, Duvall was the first player in Major League Baseball history to hit those home runs in such an order. In 2020 he batted .237/.301/.532 with 34 runs, 16 home runs (3rd in the NL), and 33 RBIs in 190 at bats, and was third in the NL in at bats per home run (11.9). Personal life Duvall was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2012. He married his wife, Michelle in 2017. https://twitter.com/aduvall123/status/940346730293293056 They have one son.

His execution was highly controversial due to accusations that Khosravi did not receive due process or fair treatment during his trial or leading up to his death. Background Khosravi hailed from Abadan, a city in southwest Iran. He was a known sympathizer of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (known frequently and interchangeably by the abbreviations MEK, PMOI, or MKO), which is a comparatively progressive political-militant organization focused on interpreting Islam in a way that politically promotes tolerance, democracy, and social and gendered equality, countering the more conservative government in power in Iran. According to the Human Rights Watch, Iranian officials consider MEK to be a terrorist organization. Khosravi was targeted repeatedly for his involvement with the organization, with his legal troubles beginning with the start of his involvement with the group in the 1980s. At one point in 1981, when he was 16 years old, he was arrested for his involvement with MEK and sentenced to ten years in prison; he was released in 1986 after serving five, during which he endured 40 months of solitary confinement in various detention centers, including Kerman's Ministry of Intelligence and the notorious Evin Prison. Arrest and sentencing In February 2008, while staying in the Kerman Province of Rafsanjan, Khosravi was arrested once again for his involvement with MEK. After his 2008 arrest, authorities claimed that they discovered documents suggesting that Khosravi was working with MEK's satellite television channel, Simaye Azadi (translated to \\"Voice of Freedom\\"). Human rights organization Iran Human Rights accused Iranian officials of subjecting Khosravi to physical and psychological torture to extract information from him, some of which may have been coerced and unreliable. They also accused Iranian officials of pressuring Khosravi to give televised confessions and to name associates, both of which he apparently refused to do. Later that year, Khosravi was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, three of which were suspended. However, the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence appealed the sentence in hopes of increasing its severity. The appeal led to the three suspended years being implemented, bringing the total time that Khosravi would spend in prison to six years. Following the extension of Khosravi's sentence, the Ministry of Intelligence appealed the sentence again, which led to two retrials being ordered for Khosravi. During the second retrial, authorities used the proof of Khosravi's monetary support to Simaye Azadi to enable charging him with moharebeh, translated to \\"crimes against God\\" or \\"enmity against God.\\" In Iran, charges of moharebeh may be brought against people who take up arms against the state or belong to organizations that are perceived as taking up arms against the government ‚Äì thereby, people who participate in treason ‚Äì as those people are seen as acting against God in doing so. Because Iranian authorities branded MEK a terrorist organization, and because Khosravi had donated money to the organization, a lower court convicted Khosravi of moharebeh and sentenced him to death in 2010. Controversy and first execution date The death sentence caused an international outcry from groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, The Center for Human Rights in Iran, National Council of Resistance of Iran, and others that condemned the Iranian government for depriving Khosravi of due process in convicting him. Namely, the organizations criticized Iran for subjecting Khosravi to double jeopardy, pointing out that Iran ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which declared in Article 14, section 7, that \\"no one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally convicted.\\" Section 6 of the same covenant states that the death penalty \\"may be imposed only for the most serious of crimes,\\" and Human Rights Watch accused Iran of violating the covenant by executing Khosravi for the mere offense of \\"providing information and money to a Mojahedin-e Khalq-affiliated television station,\\" which would not meet the threshold specified in Section 6. Lastly, Human Rights Watch pointed out that the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the committee in charge of monitoring signatories' compliance with the covenant, required \\"scrupulous respect of the guarantees of fair trial\\" and that failure to abide by \\"the provisions of article 14 [‚Ä¶] constitutes a violation of the right to life.\\" A few of the organizations also called for Iran to begin a moratorium on the death penalty, calling it \\"much-abused,\\" with Human Rights Watch specifying that Iran should get rid of \\"vague anti-terrorism laws that criminalize peaceful dissent\\" as well. Following an appeal by Khosravi's lawyer challenging the legality of the death sentence, the Supreme Court of Iran affirmed Khosravi's death sentence on 21 April 2012. Following the affirmation of the sentence, it became clear that there were no longer any legal hurdles to executing Khosravi. The Human Rights Watch declared in a release demanding a stop to the execution that Iranian officials could schedule a date of execution as early as 10 September 2012. As Khosravi's 2012 execution date approached, one of his family members, speaking to Human Rights Watch, revealed that Khosravi endured 40 days of solitary confinement during his interrogation in February 2008, as well as during the investigation that unearthed Khosravi's ties and support to Simaye Azadi. Moreover, neither Khosravi's family nor his lawyers had been formally notified of authorities' plans to execute Khosravi on 10 September; discussions of the imminent execution date arose from the fact that Khosravi was transferred to Ward 350 of Evin Prison, suggesting that authorities planned to execute him there imminently. Iranian law requires the family and lawyers of a condemned person to be informed of an execution date. Shortly before 10 September 2012, the execution was postponed indefinitely. In May 2013, Iran revised its Islamic Penal Code to specify that charges of moharebeh could only be brought against people who had literally, not figuratively, taken up arms. In spite of the fact that this change to the penal code excluded Khosravi from the death penalty, Iranian officials did not act to change Khosravi's sentence. As a result of the Iranian government's failure to change Khosravi's sentence, the President of the International Federation for Human Rights, Karim Lahidji, stated, \\"It may only be concluded that Mr. Khosravi Savadjani faced an extremely unfair trial influenced by the intelligence and security services.\\" Imprisonment and execution Sometime close to when his first date of execution was postponed, Iranian officials ordered Khosravi's defense attorney, Abdolfattah Soltani, to be imprisoned for 18 years on charges unrelated to Khosravi's case. According to Soltani's daughter, the charges were for \\"co-founding the Center for Human Rights Defenders, spreading anti- government propaganda, endangering national security and accepting an illegal prize [the Nuremberg International Human Rights Award]\\". Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience, \\"held solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and association, including his work as a defence lawyer and in the Centre\\". Soltani was sent to Evin Prison's Ward 350, where he shared a cell with his former client. Approximately two months prior to Khosravi's execution, on 17 April 2014, Evin Prison guards raided Ward 350 and beat many of the inmates imprisoned there. Khosravi suffered severe head and face wounds, including having his right ear torn. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran, the guards were acting on orders from the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence to single out and assault Ward 350's political prisoners. Subsequent to the assault, Khosravi was transferred to a solitary confinement cell for nearly two weeks. He was refused any medical treatment despite the severity of his wounds. Even in that condition, Khosravi staged a hunger strike with other prisoners who had also been forced into solitary confinement, protesting to be moved out of solitary confinement and back to Ward 350. After 23 days and a worldwide campaign, guards obliged, and the hunger strike ended. However, one informed Khosravi that he was to be executed imminently. Iran Human Rights posited that Khosravi's execution, which was indeed scheduled soon after the hunger strike, may have been in retaliation against the political prisoners' resistance and protest of the 17 April assault. Khosravi was transferred to the Quarantine Section of Raja'i Shahr Prison of Karaj on 28 May 2014. Three days later on 31 May, the day before his execution, he was placed in solitary confinement for one last time as preparations for his execution were underway. Soon after his move to the prison, his family members were notified that they could visit him. Only after the visit were they notified that it would be their last visit with him and that his execution was scheduled for dawn the next morning. The unusual and sudden timing for the family visit, combined with Khosravi's transfer to Raja'i Shahr Prison, alerted human rights organizations to the impending execution. On 31 May, Amnesty International released a statement and a last-minute plea calling Khosravi's impending execution \\"a violation of international and national laws.\\" They demanded that the Iranian regime halt his execution immediately while the Deputy of Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa sector, Hasibeh Haj-Saraei, released a separate statement announcing that \\"the Iranian authorities are about to execute a man who has been denied a fair trial.\\" Nevertheless, on 1 June 2014, Khosravi was executed by hanging in Raja'i Shahr Prison. He was buried in Esfahan in central Iran as officials from the Ministry of Intelligence watched. Only one of his family members was permitted to attend the burial.

Following the area's theme, the ride was painted blue and was covered in a shiny metal, most likely steel. Each of its two arms had a counterweight in the shape of two metal spikes, which would sweep near to the ground like a scythe. The sequence was always the same, different from some other weight-based rides that have numerous sequences; this was also probably to be more energy efficient. The ride type itself is a rare flat ride not seen at a lot of theme parks, Submission did not have the best of reviews at Alton Towers, mainly due to it having the same sequence (unlike others such as Ripsaw) and the restraints being very similar to those on a Huss Top Spinner making it fairly uncomfortable to ride when inverted. Breakdowns occasionally happened and, as a result, queues were very short. In 2013 it was revealed that Submission would be closed after the end of the 2013 season by which there is a vacant grass area where it once stood next to the break-block section on Oblivion. The grass area is often referred to as the 'Submission memorial ground' by thrill-seekers and has become a popular sitting area in the park section. Ride experience Submission was a simple ride, featuring a central tower with two gondolas attached to rotating arms on each side. Each gondola contained 6 rows of 4. When the ride started, the gondola was lifted 90 degrees back and forth, slightly tilting forwards and backwards and gradually rotated in a full circle with the gondola spinning the opposite way to the arm, making the riders go upside down. As the arm would move in one direction, the gondola would tilt in the other way. Because of the double sided seating which saw riders sitting back-to-back, when one arm moved one way, there would be one set of riders tilted vertically, pointing to the ground, not dissimilar from Oblivion. When the gondola reached its highest point, it was turned upside-down.

Dorothea Noelle Naomi \\"Thea\\" Porter (24 December 1927 - 24 July 2000) was a British artist, fashion designer and retailer who in the 1960s brought opulent Middle East fashions to London. Early life She was born Dorothea Noelle Naomi Seale, on 24 December 1927, in Jerusalem, and raised in Damascus. She was the daughter of Morris S. Seale, the Arabist and theologian, who was a Christian missionary in Syria, and his French wife, who was also a missionary. Her brother was the journalist Patrick Seale, and her sister Barbara \\"Bobbie\\" Seale married the yacht designer Beecher Moore. Porter was educated at the Lyc√©e Fran√ßaise in Damascus, Fernhill Manor, then for a short time studying French and Old English at Royal Holloway College, London, before being expelled. Following her studies in England, she worked in the library of the British embassy in Beirut, where she met her future husband, Robert Porter. Together they travelled to Jordan and Iran, and had holidays in France and Italy. She studied painting during the day, and \\"went to nightclubs every night and had millions of clothes.\\" In June 1961 Porter had her first solo painting exhibition at the Alecco Saab Gallery, Beirut. Career After she separated from her husband, Porter moved to London in May 1964. Her first job was in interior design, working for Elizabeth Eaton. She opened her first shop, an interior decorating business offering imported cushions, fabrics and hangings called Thea Porter Decorations Ltd, in Soho at 8 Greek Street on 27 July 1966. She realised that rather than just cutting up her imported kaftans to use the fabric for cushion covers, they were fashionable in their own right, and began making up her own in mixed fabrics and antique trimmings. From 1967, she expanded internationally; her first wholesale client was Henri Bendel in New York in 1968. Her customers, some of whom also became her friends, included Baby Jane Holzer, Lauren Bacall, Talitha Getty, Bianca Jagger, Mick Jagger, Inaara Aga Khan, Jutta Laing (the wife of R D Laing), Pamela, Lady Harlech, Veronique Peck, Princess Margaret, Edna O'Brien, Sharon Tate, Elizabeth Taylor, and Pete Townshend. In 1971, Porter opened a store in New York financed by Michael Butler, the producer of the hit Broadway musical Hair. It closed after six months, but she continued to sell very successfully at high- end boutiques across the United States; Giorgio Beverly Hills sold approximately $300,000 worth of Thea Porter designs per year in the mid-1970s.Thea Porter: Bohemian Chic On 1 April 1977 she opened a store in Paris, on the ; this closed in 1979. Thea Porter Decorations Ltd went into receivership in February 1981; she subsequently worked from ateliers on Avery Row and Beauchamp Place. In 1986 Porter had a short business partnership with Princess Dina of Jordan in a smaller shop, Arabesque, on Motcomb Street. Zandra Rhodes has stated, \\"Sadly, one didn't hear of her after that\\". In her obituary, The Guardian noted that Porter had little interest in marketing and was generally poor at business. Personal life In 1952, she married Robert \\"Bob\\" Porter, an economist with the British Embassy in Beirut. They divorced in 1964 or 1967. They had one daughter, Venetia. In 1994 she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and died in London on 24 July 2000.

Smith served in Malaya during the Second World War and survived being held as a prisoner of war by the Japanese. During his imprisonment, Smith experienced many hardships and was forced to work on the Burma Railway, an experience which was illustrated by the film The Bridge on the River Kwai. Smith went to Melville College and was a medical student at the University of Edinburgh for two years before enlisting during the war. Smith was sent to fight in Malaya at the age of 21 and suffered three gunshot wounds during the Battle of Slim River. After marching for three weeks he was taken prisoner at Pudu Prison in Kuala Lumpur. After a few months he was taken to Tamarkan as forced labour to work on the railway there. Initially Smith worked on the construction of railway bridges over the river, but the compound was converted to a hospital camp which allowed him to use his medical training to help fellow prisoners. In 1945, Smith was facing execution by his captors but was saved by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which brought about the end of the war and Smith's liberation. He was said to have displayed \\"immense courage\\" to survive the horrific treatment he endured as a prisoner, and by the end of the war, he weighed only 6 stone. His resourcefulness in helping other prisoners was also noted: he made surgical tools to treat prisoners, sedating them with chloroform; he created a distillation unit to obtain clean water; he fixed a radio smuggled into the prison; and he found a way to diagnose malaria in his fellow prisoners earlier. After the war, Smith served in Germany on bomb disposal work for the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. In 1945, he moved to De Havilland to work on the Blue Streak (missile), and later on the Europa (rocket) project. Smith was awarded the 1939‚Äì45 Star, the Pacific Star, and the War Medal 1939‚Äì1945. Smith published his memoirs, entitled War Memories: A Medical Student in Malaya and Thailand in 2008.

The two gabled wings on either side of the hall are jettied with the second floor projecting forward and the timber framing forming a decorated geometric pattern. . History of Penarth Penarth lies in Dyffryn Llanfair, an ancient township which lies to the south of the river Severn. The earliest known owner of Penarth was Richard Pryce, who in 1604 was commemorated in a poem by the Welsh Bard and Herald, Lewys Dwnn. Dwnn was lived in nearby Bettws Cedewain.For information about Lewys Dwnn see:Lewys Dwnn Heraldic Visitations of Wales and Part of the Marches Edited by Sir Samuel Rush Merrick, Welsh MSS Society, Llandovery 1846, reprinted Bridge Books , Wrexham 2005 Penarth continued in the Pryce family ownership and there are references to a later Richard Pryce in the Manorial records in 1696. In 1710 and 1717 an Edward Powell, Gent is mentioned as living at Penarth Ucha. The Rev John Parker, (noted for his diaries and drawings of Church screens), who was Rector of Llanmerewig (1827-1844), lived here.

He was born at Thurnby, Leicestershire and died at Pickenham Hall, near Swaffham, Norfolk. Cricket career Hartopp appeared in several matches for Cambridge University in both 1841 and 1842, including, in each of these seasons, the University Match against Oxford University. In his Cambridge games, he batted regularly at the tail-end of the batting order, and he does not appear to have bowled or kept wicket. From 1842 onwards, he started playing for Marylebone Cricket Club and he made 36 appearances for that team over the next 10 years; he also played in 1843 for Nottinghamshire and a team representing the Midland Counties, and he started appearing also for \\"Gentlemen of England\\" teams of amateurs which played various county sides or other amateur combinations. In 1851, he appeared for the Gentlemen in the annual match against the Players at Lord's. In 1844 and 1845 Hartopp played in 11 first-class matches in each season; a leading cricketer of the period, such as Alfred Mynn, played in a very similar number of major matches. Yet Hartopp remained a singularly unsuccessful cricketer, usually batting at the tail-end and bowling only twice in his career, and his career batting average over 69 first-class matches is just 4.25. His highest score in 120 first-class innings was 22, made in one of his occasional forays to the top of the batting order in an MCC match against Oxford University in 1846 in which the whole team had been dismissed for 24 in the first innings. From 1853 to 1857, he played in only one match per season, with none at all in 1855; in those four games, he batted seven times, and a score of 2 in his final innings in 1857 ended a succession of six ducks. Career outside cricket Hartopp was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He is described as \\"of Clipsham Hall, Rutland\\", but his second marriage was to the daughter of the owner of Pickenham Hall in Norfolk, where he died in 1894. At the time of his death, he was the auditor for the Marylebone Cricket Club's accounts.

It describes the \\"war\\" between two gangs from rival villages, Longeverne and Velrans, in the countryside of Franche-Comt√©. The author got his inspiration from the village of Landresse, where he taught for two years. The title comes from the goal of the war, to get as many buttons as possible from the opposing side by cutting them off shirts and pants. For the most part, the story is told from the point of view of the children from Longeverne.  Plot  The children of Longeverne, Lebrac and his army, and the army of Velrans, led by Aztec de Gu√©s, fight each other without mercy, with sticks, stones, and their bare hands. Those who are unfortunate enough to fall into enemy hands are certain to face humiliation: their buttons and laces are cut off, and they are forced to return home, where they are sure to get a beating from their parents.

Her name means \\"self\\", or \\"essence.\\" The idafa construction that means \\"possessor of [something]\\" uses dh√¢t as the first term.

Hosam Aboul-Ela of the University of Houston wrote that therefore the work argues that the character \\"has been socially constructed, rather than appearing already whole as a product of biology.\\" Aboul-Ela explained that her character reflects the trends of Egyptian culture and politics which \\"reinforces the notion that she is not a Dickensian or Stendhalian protagonist, who will grow and become complete over the course of the novel.\\" He added that the concept of the three starting points is also an argument suggesting inadequacy with \\"the traditional realist notion of linear narrative\\". Aboul-Ela argued that Zaat \\"often seems to be written against the classic 19th-century European bildungsroman\\", and that the character does \\"not progress, grow, and learn enough over the course of the novel to make Zaat a bildungsroman.\\" * Himmat - One of Zaat's friends, Himmat and Zaat join forces to report to health authorities a grocer who sold Zaat expired olives  The names \\"Zaat\\" and \\"Himmat\\" combined form the name of the Abbasid princess dh√¢t al-himma (\\"possessor of zeal\\"). * Abdel Maguid- Zaat's husband and the father of her three children. She states that she either has to leave him or she will end up pregnant again. He is controlling and believes himself to be very intelligent. Television adaptation In 2012, Misr International Films ( MIF) was producing a television series based on Zaat. Filming of scenes set at Ain Shams University in Cairo was scheduled to occur that year, but Muslim Brotherhood student members and some teachers at the school protested, stating that the 1970s era clothing worn by the actresses was indecent and would not allow filming unless the clothing was changed. Gaby Khoury, the head of the film company, stated that engineering department head Sherif Hammad \\"insisted that the filming should stop and that we would be reimbursed ... explaining that he was not able to guarantee the protection of the materials or the artists.\\"\\"Islamists halt filming of Egyptian TV series.\\" Daily News Egypt.

The insurgency declined in the late 1980s and 1990s and has been sidelined by the larger Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict (1978‚Äìpresent). Low-level armed attacks continue to be carried out by Maoist insurgent groups, the most significant of which are the Liberation Army of the Workers and Peasants of Turkey (Tƒ∞KKO) (the armed wing of the Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) and the People's Liberation Army (HKO) and People's Partisan Forces (PHG), both armed wings of the Maoist Communist Party. History On April 24, 1972, the Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist‚ÄìLeninist (TKP/ML, sometimes incorrectly referred to as Partizan after the name of one of its publications) was formed by a radical group led by ƒ∞brahim Kaypakkaya, and intended to wage a people's war. However, a year later Kaypakkaya was captured, tortured and killed. In 1978, it had its first conference, affirming its plan for guerrilla warfare, although little progress was made in this direction. The TKP/ML was involved in political violence between left and right wing groups in the 1970s. TKP/ML's military wing, the Liberation Army of the Workers and Peasants of Turkey (Tƒ∞KKO), carried out militant and guerrilla actions in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, mainly in the Tunceli Province, whose inhabitants saw the Maoist guerrilla war as revenge for the repression of the Dersim rebellion in 1938.Construction of a Nation: The Early Years of the Turkish Republic and Dersim Events Tƒ∞KKO reached its height during this period, carrying out guerrilla warfare in the mountainous areas of the Dersim and Black Sea regions.Turkey and the War on Terror: \\"For Forty Years we Fought Alone\\", page 27 In the late 1980s, the TKP/ML suffered from a series of splits following the party's second congress. In 1993, the TKP/ML attempted unsuccessfully to reunify with the Maoist Communist Party (Turkey) On May 17, 1985, the TKP/ML broadcast a propaganda message to millions of television viewers in Istanbul, replacing the soundtrack for the evening news.A World to Win Magazine, 1985, \\"TKP/ML seizes the airwaves 8PM News Break\\" =2000s= In 2000, Turkish security forces launched operations against Tƒ∞KKO insurgents in the provinces of Tokat and Sivas. Discovering 12 hideouts, they recovered nine machine guns, four rocket launchers, grenades, and explosives, as well as 10 tonnes of food and medicine. On December 11, 2000, Tƒ∞KKO insurgents open fire on a police special task force, killing two and wounding 12. In 2001, police captured five insurgents and weapons including two 9K111 Fagot anti-tank missiles. In March 2009, Tamer Bilici, a doctor in service during a 2000 hunger strike in Kandƒ±ra F-type prison, was \\"in front of his house punished with death\\" by MKP-HKO for being a public enemy because he was blamed for the deaths and permanent disabilities of inmates. In September 2009 MKP-HKO claimed responsibility for the death of a retired colonel, Aytekin ƒ∞√ßmez. =2010s= On 29 June 2010, two guerrillas of the Tƒ∞KKO were killed in the mountains of Tunceli by the Turkish state forces. On 2 February 2011, five guerrillas of Tƒ∞KKO in Tunceli died as a result of an avalanche. On 15 November 2012, 24 guerrillas of HKO were surrounded and captured in Tunceli On 26 July 2013, the control building of a hydroelectric power plant regulator was bombed in the countryside of Tunceli Province by Tƒ∞KKO militants. 2014 On 14 March 2014, Tƒ∞KKO guerrillas attacked a police station in Tunceli. TKP/ML declared that the attack was revenge for the death of Berkin Elvan. On 8 July 2014, Tƒ∞KKO guerrillas stopped a truck carrying five workers to a base station at Altƒ±ny√ºz√ºk and set the vehicle on fire. On 15 August 2014, TiKKO guerrillas attacked a Gendarmerie Station in Ovacik, no Deaths were reported. 2015 In June 2015, MKP-PHG killed former colonel Fehmi Altinbilek. On 22 July, Tƒ∞KKO guerrillas attacked a Gendarmerie Station in Hozat. No casualties were reported.

On 15 October, Tƒ∞KKO guerrillas attacked the military base of Amukta, in Hozat county. On 21 October, three Tƒ∞KKO guerrillas died in a clash with TSK in Ovacƒ±k. The funeral of guerrillas was attended by hundreds of people, who sang songs and shouted revolutionary slogans. 2016 On 9 May, two Tƒ∞KKO guerrillas were killed in Geyiksuyu during a clash with TSK Soldiers. During 24‚Äì28 November, twelve guerrillas of TKP/ML Tƒ∞KKO died during an army operation at Aliboƒüazƒ± region of the Dersim province. 2017 On 10 February, Tƒ∞KKO fighters set fire to the AKP headquarter in Pendik district, Istanbul.

In September 2007 he was appointed professor for evaluation and methodology of developmental psychology at the University of Graz. Since April 2010, Rindermann holds the Chair of Educational and Developmental Psychology at the Technical University of Chemnitz. According to New Statesman, Rindermann serves on the editorial board of the journal Intelligence, has been a contributor to Mankind Quarterly, and has helped to organized conferences for the International Society for Intelligence Research. Rindermann has attended the London Conference on Intelligence, and was one of 15 attendees to collaborate on a letter defending the conference following media reports of its association with eugenics. The letter was published in Intelligence in 2018. Research Rindermann does research in educational psychology, developmental psychology, differential psychology, pedagogy, and clinical psychology. =Intelligence and education= A 2007 study by Rindermann found a high correlation between the results of international student assessment studies including TIMSS, PIRLS, and PISA, and national average IQ scores. The results were broadly similar to those in Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen's book IQ and the Wealth of Nations. According to Earl B. Hunt, due to there being far more data available, Rindermann's analysis was more reliable than those by Lynn and Vanhanen. By measuring the relationship between educational data and social well-being over time, Rindermann also performed a causal analysis, finding that nations investing in education leads to increased well-being later on.Hunt, Earl. Human Intelligence. Cambridge University Press, 2011. Page 440-443. Some of Rindermann's work has concentrated on the \\"smart fraction\\" theory, which states that the prosperity and performance of a society depends on the proportion of the population that is above a particular threshold of intelligence, with the threshold point being well above the general median intelligence level in most societies.

Earlier in her career, she represented Kenosha County in the Wisconsin State Assembly as a Democrat. Biography Born in Burlington, Wisconsin, Wagner graduated from Central High School in Salem, Wisconsin. She earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1971 and went to work as a teacher. She was elected Kenosha County Clerk in 1976, then elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1978, representing the 66th assembly district as a Democrat. She continued her education and, in 1982, earned her J.D. from the University of Wisconsin Law School. She was re-elected in 1980, but was defeated seeking re- election in 1982 after being redistricted into a matchup with fellow incumbent Cloyd A. Porter. After leaving the Assembly, Wagner worked as an attorney and state tax commissioner. In 1991, Kenosha County Circuit Judge Gerald W. Breitenbach declined to seek re-election after the State Judicial Commission filed charges accusing him of improperly keeping a loaded pistol in his courtroom and verbally abusing lawyers. Wagner was one of six candidates who decided to run for the open judgeship. She came in second in the primary but was able to defeat an ally of then-Governor Tommy Thompsonin the general election by 621 votes. Judge Wagner went on to win re-election in 1997, 2003, 2009, and 2015. In 2008, Judge Wagner was appointed Chief Judge of the 2nd Judicial Administrative District by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. She remained chief judge for the maximum 3 two-year terms. She was Chair of the Committee of Chief Judges in 2013 and 2014. Personal life and family On September 11, 1982, Wagner married Judge John E. Malloy, who was then a Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge in Kenosha County.

She is co-founder of the not-for-profit engineering consultancy Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology (CAWST). She has held senior positions in the petroleum industry, received national and international honors and was President and CEO of CAWST until September 2011.  Career  After graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering from McGill University, Baker worked in the petroleum industry for over 20 years in executive positions with Norcen Energy Resources Limited, Conwest, Alberta Energy Company and was a member of the board of directors for the Alberta Oil Sands Technical Research Authority. As a career change, seeking to apply engineering principles to the problem of supplying clean water and sanitation worldwide, she enrolled in the Masters Environmental Science Design programme at University of Calgary. She undertook her master's project on biosand filter technology with Dr. David Manz and they then co- founded CAWST in 2001 to transfer this technology to poor countries. In 2011 she stepped down from her role as CEO of CAWST but continued to work on research projects for CAWST. The goal of CAWST is to provide education, technical training and consulting in water and sanitation to the NGOs and government agencies working with the poor in developing countries to remedy the lack of engineering expertise within the sector. Many organisations are involved in this area but Dow Baker's vision was for an organisation to provide training as long-term capacity building rather than installing infrastructure. In 2005, as a member of the World Health Organization's Implementation Working Group of the WHO International Network to Promote Household Drinking Water and Safe Storage, Dow Baker presented CAWST's approach at a WHO International Symposium. In 2010 CAWST was awarded the Special Prize by the Fonds Suez Environnement Initiatives Institut de France, an award that recognises achievements in effective sanitation, waste and water management in developing countries. The philanthropist David P. O'Brien has supported CAWST for a decade, after learning about its work from Dow Baker. By 2014, CAWST had supported 793 implementing organizations in 68 countries, whose projects have resulted in 9.3 million people gaining access to better water or sanitation. It is based in Calgary, Canada.  Honors  Baker has received several national and international awards for her humanitarian work. These include the Alberta Centennial Medal, awarded by the government of the Canadian province of Alberta to 8000 of its citizens who have made notable contributions to the province and its people, a Women of Vision Award from Global, Calgary in 2005-6 and also honorary degrees from the University of Calgary and Mount Royal University.  Personal life  She was born in Trinidad and Tobago in 1957. She and her husband Derek have two children. Discussion with her then teenaged son, Hugh, was one of the reasons for her career change and foundation of CAWST after realising the great worldwide need for safe drinking water.

Tudela was a member of the 14th session of the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives and two- term Mayor for the island of Saipan, the capital and largest Municipality in the Northern Mariana Islands, serving from January 2002 to January 2010. He was later succeeded by newly elected Republican, Mayor Donald Flores. Biography =Early life and education= Tudela was born to Jesus Tudela and Anunciaci√≥n Borja on May 17, 1936, on the island of Saipan, which was then part of the Japanese mandate for the South Seas Islands. He was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. As a child, he served as altar server alongside his friend, Tomas Aguon Camacho, who would later become the first Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chalan Kanoa. Tudela received compulsory education from the Japanese-mandate government until around the time of the invasion of Saipan on June 15, 1944. He was eight years old when the United States' 2nd Marine Division, 4th Marine Division, and 27th Infantry Division landed on Saipan. Saipan was declared secured by the Allied Forces in July, and Tudela's family was relocated to Camp Susupe, where they would remain for the duration of the war and early post-war years. At the conclusion of the World War II, the Mariana Islands entered a period of reconstruction and transition into a post-war Naval Administrative region. In his early teens, Tudela briefly left Saipan to attend seminary school on the island of Guam with the intention of becoming an ordained Catholic priest at Father Duenas Memorial School in Dededo. Tudela would never complete his religious studies and returned to Saipan, taking up a messenger position with the Naval Technical Training Unit (NTTU) at NAS Tanapag. =Early Career and Community Involvement= 220x220px Upon his start with the NTTU, Tudela worked as a messenger, later promoted to clerk-typist, eventually reaching the position of supervisor. By the time of his appointment as a supervisor, the islands had transitioned from a post-war Naval Administration to a United Nations established Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) member governed by the United States of America. As a supervisor, Tudela oversaw the procurement and supply of military surplus. Tudela supervised the distribution of these resources across the NMI and other members of the TTPI, still recovering from the effects of 1962 Pacific Typhoon season, specifically, Typhoon Jean, which tore through the islands in present- day CNMI and FSM. In the 1970s, Tudela moved from the village of Chalan Kanoa to the village of Garapan. He served as community leader in the local Catholic parish before being encouraged to become a district commissioner. Tudela was also instrumental in organizing the local boy scout Scout troop, now district member for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in the islands. Tudela witnessed the NMI early economic growth, development of early infrastructure, and early formation of the CNMI government that would later shape his role in the political landscape.

When he took office in January 2002, Tudela was the first Democratic mayor in nearly two decades. Tudela's successful campaign won him re-election to a second, four-year term in November 2005 as a member of the established, now defunct, Covenant Party, riding the popularity of then CNMI Governor Benigno Fitial. He was a strong proponent of the NMI-Japan Cultural Exchange Program, which invited Japanese exchange students to the Northern Mariana Islands, helping to re-established the CNMI's connection with mainland Japan. This would eventually lead up to the climactic visit of members in the Imperial House of Japan, Emperor Akihito and the Empress of Japan Michiko. At the end of his second-term in 2009, Tudela announced his decision not to seek re-election for a third term in 2014, after observing the two-term limit tradition. He was succeeded as Mayor of Saipan by Republican Donald Flores, who took office in January 2010.

It debuted at number 14 on The New York Times Best Seller list for print and E-book fiction and number 9 on the Hardcover Fiction list. Background The series as a whole was first inspired by Jeff Eastin after he sent an email to Rice, who stated that \\"he had seen a special on werewolves and if I ever decided to tackle the subject he would certainly buy the book and for some reason he just said that at the right time\\". The dedication in The Wolf Gift to Eastin is due to this instigation. Rice stated that The Wolf Gift was originally meant to be a standalone book that had a full story. Despite not having the intention for it to be a series, she found that she \\"wanted to continue it because I loved the characters and I loved the whole story\\", leading to the creation of The Wolves of Midwinter. She also commented that she intends to write a third book in the series as well. The setting of the book is meant to emulate the home and atmosphere of the Madewood Plantation House, which Rice visited in the last 1980's for their Christmas party. Millie Ball, the owner of the plantation, is included in the book's dedication as well. Critical reception NPR reviewer Alan Cheuse noted that while \\"the dialogue now and then seems a little stilted\\", they nonetheless \\"really enjoyed watching Rice create yet another world of strangeness and transformations along the lines of her greatest achievements\\". Elizabeth Hand, writing for The Washington Post, criticized the novel for offering \\"intriguing glimpses of the ancient history of the Morphenkinder and a tantalizing promise of darker revelations to come\\", yet ultimately involving a plot that is \\"only a series of setpieces and occasional supernatural intrusions, all too neatly resolved\\" that creates a written universe where \\"evildoers disappear down the hatch without a trace, ghosts natter on in sappy New Age-speak, and even the werewolves have been metaphorically defanged\\". Kirkus Reviews summed up the novel as a \\"complex fantasy world [that] relies on an elaborate substructure of lore and history, and the action slows as points of exposition are repetitiously belabored\\". A review in Publishers Weekly also pointed out that \\"new conflicts and antagonists are introduced and dealt with in a late rush, and Reuben‚Äôs forays as Man Wolf are perfunctory, taking up fewer pages than the party planning\\", but also stated that the book is \\"not without charm\\", especially due to its \\"sympathetic protagonists\\" and that the \\"series mythology, suggesting that the fair folk may be evolved human ghosts, is fascinating\\".

The members of the Cerambycidae ‚Äî Longhorn Beetles ‚Äî family are named for their long antennae, sometimes exceedingly so. The antennae of males are usually longer than those of females, and often the antennae are attached to the head in a strange notch at the front of the eye. Longhorn beetle larvae are called round-headed borers and most feed on dead and decaying wood. Some species feed on living plants. They tunnel inside the wood and so are rarely seen, only emerging as adults. Most species have a limited flight time during which they may be found. Adult longhorn beetles feed on flower nectar, sap, or leaves and bark. They tend to be strong flyers and are sometimes attracted to lights at night. While individuals of some species are almost always the same size, at times there can be rather pronounced variation, both within the same gender and also between males and females. Males can be much smaller than females. One slender brown beetle that has some very distinctive features is Styloxus fulleri. This is a smaller species, at about 12‚Äì13 mm in length. The elytra (hardened front wings) do not completely cover the other pair of wings, but end about two- thirds down the length of the body. The antennae are super-long, with very long thin segments. Their eyes are huge on a rather small head.

Potonch√°n, was a Chontal Maya city, capital of the minor kingdom known as Tavasco or Tabasco. It occupied the left bank of the Tabasco River, which the Spanish renamed the Grijalva River, in the current Mexican state of Tabasco. Juan de Grijalva arrived to this town on June 8, 1518, and christened the river with his name and met with the Maya chief Tabscoob to whom, it is said, he gave his green velvet doublet. Later, on March 12, 1519, the Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s arrived. Cort√©s, unlike Grijalva, was received by the natives in a warlike fashion, leading to the Battle of Centla. After the native defeat, Cort√©s founded the first Spanish settlement in New Spain, the town of Santa Mar√≠a de la Victoria, on top of Potonch√°n. Toponymy The word Potonch√°n comes from the Nahuatl: \\"pononi\\" means \\"smell\\" and \\"chan\\" is a toponymic termination; therefore, it translates as \\"place that smells.\\" Another, more plausible, etymology is that \\"poton\\" comes from the name the Chontal Maya called themselves: the Put√∫n Maya which was also spelled Poton; thus it most likely translates as \\"Poton place.\\" Location and environment The city of Potonch√°n was located on the left bank of the Tabasco River, which was christened the Grijalva River by the Spaniards, and according to the chronicles of Bernal Diaz del Castillo, it was a league from the coast. The city was located on a small hill of sandstone, practically surrounded by water on three sides. On one side was, the river, and on the other two sides, swamps. It was in a region of extensive floodplains. Potonch√°n was the capital of the cacicazgo of Tabasco, and was one of two principal cities of the Chontal Maya, along with Itzamkanac, capital of the cacicazgo of Acal√°n. However, unlike Itzamkanac which was located in the midst of the jungle, Potonch√°n was a maritime port and fluvial, which allowed it to have an intense commercial exchange both with the towns of the Yucat√°n Peninsula and with those of the central High Plains. The Chontal Maya took full advantage of their environment, using the rivers as routes of transportation and communication with different Mayan cities and provinces. They were good navigators and merchants and controlled many maritime routes around the Yucat√°n Peninsula, from the Laguna de T√©rminos in Campeche to the center of Sula in Honduras. At a point located between the current states of Tabasco and Campeche, the Mexica port of Xicalango was found with whom Potoch√°n fought countless wars for control of the territory. The last of these great wars was won by Potonch√°n just before the year 1512. In tribute, the people of Xicalango presented several women to the chief Tascoob, one of which was Malintzin (famed as \\"La Malinche\\"), who would later be given to Cort√©s after the Battle of Centla in 1519. Description of the population The little that is known of Potonch√°n is thanks to the chronicles of the Spanish conquistadors. With regards to its population, it is known that it was one of the most populated Mayan cities of the Tabasco Plain, because the cleric Juan D√≠az, in his \\"Itinerary,\\" speaks of the arrival of Juan de Grijalva's expedition in 1518, it \\"had more than two thousand Indians...\\" For his part, Bernal Diaz del Castillo in Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa√±a, says that when they reached Potonch√°n, it had \\"over twelve thousand warriors ready to attack [in the main square], plus the riverbank was all full of Indians in the bushes....\\" Peter Martyr says in his chronicle, that \\"the great city flanks the river of Tabasco, so great that it has twenty-five thousand houses...\\" This gives us an idea of the size of the city and of the quantity of inhabitants Potonch√°n would have had, as well as the natives that were living in nearby towns under control of Potonch√°n proper. The city was very inhabited, the houses were made mostly of adobe. Potonch√°n counted on intense commercial activity, in fact, this was the predominant activity. Across the sea, Potonch√°n had an important river-based trade with towns like Guazacualco, Xicalango, Chak√°n Putum and Kaan Peech. It also had commercial ties to the Mayan provinces of Acal√°n and Mazatl√°n located in the jungles of what is today the border area of the states Tabasco and Campeche with Guatemala. This trade reached as far as the port of Nito on Guatemala's Atlantic Coast. Regarding the urban design of the city, very little is known. Owing to the nature of the place, in which many structures were made of \\"seto\\" (hedgerows) and \\"guano\\" (palms of genus Coccothrinax). In other cases, the vestiges disappeared at the initiation of Spanish construction of the town of Santa Mar√≠a de la Victoria, which was built over top the indigenous structures. The Tabascan historian Manuel Gil Saenz reports that around the year 1872, near the port of Frontera, excavations resulting from some \\"monter√≠as\\" (logging camps) discovered several remains of columns, idols, jars, vases and even ruins of pyramids. History =Founding= Although the date of its foundation is unknown, it is known that it was due to the separation that occurred among the Maya of Mayapan and the Chontal Maya. The latter formed Potonch√°n's kingdom, whose head was Tabscoob, who ruled under the name of chief or lord of Tabasco. The encounter between Juan de Grijalva and the Mayan chief Tabscoob occurred in Potonch√°n on June 8, 1518. The encounter between Juan de Grijalva and the Mayan chief Tabscoob occurred in Potonch√°n on June 8, 1518. For its internal government, having the same Mayan costumes and laws, they adopted the same governmental system that existed from when they were united until the collapse of the Mayan empire. That is, with the three existing social classes: nobility and the priesthood, tributaries, and slaves. It was like that until the arrival of Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1519. =Arrival of Juan de Grijalva in 1518= The first Spanish expedition to touch Tabascan land was led by Juan de Grijalva, who on June 8, 1518, discovered for Western eyes the territory that is now the state of Tabasco. Grijalva arrived that day at the mouth of a great river, which the crew named \\"Grijalva\\" in honor of their captain, its discoverer. Juan de Grijalva decided to go down the river to discover the inland area, and found four canoes full of Indians, painted and making gesticulations and gestures of war. They showed their displeasure with his arrival, but Grijalva sent the Indians Juli√°n and Melchorejo so that they could explain to the natives in the Mayan tongue that they came in peace. Thus they continued along the river and, after less than a league, discovered the population of Potonch√°n. Once ashore, Juan de Grijalva, with the help of Mayan interpreters that he had taken earlier, began to strike up a friendly dialog. In addition to flattering the natives with gifts, Grijalva begged them to call their boss to meet and hold talks with him. And so, after a while, the chief Tabscoob appeared with his nobles to greet Grijalva. During the talk, both figures exchanged gifts: to Grijalva, Tabscoob presented some gold plates in the form of armor and some feathers; whereas Grijalva gave the Mayan chief his green velvet doublet. Hern√°n Cort√©s, Conqueror of Potonch√°n and founder of Santa Mar√≠a de la Victoria, first Spanish settlement in New Spain. Tabscoob told the Spanish captain of a place called Culua that was \\"toward where the sun set...\\" there was much more of that material. Grijalva in turn, spoke with the Mayan chief with courtesy, admitting that he came in the name of a great lord named Charles V, who was very good, and he wanted to have them as vassals. Tabscoob responded that they lived happily as they were, and that they needed no other lord, and that if he wanted to preserve his friendship with Tabscoob, Grijalva's expedition should leave. Grijalva, after stocking water and provisions, embarked on his way to Culua (modern-day San Juan de Ul√∫a). =Arrival of Hern√°n Cort√©s in 1519= Nearly a year after, on March 12, 1519, the Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s arrived at the mouth of the Grijalva river. He decided to have his ships drop anchor and enter the river in skiffs, in search of the great city of Indians described by Juan de Grijalva. Cort√©s landed right at the mouth of the river, at a place named \\"Punta de los Palmares.\\" To discover their intentions, Cort√©s, by way of a translator, told some natives that were in a boat that \\"he would do no harm, to those who came in peace and that he only wanted to speak with them.\\" But Cort√©s, seeing that the natives were still threatening, ordered weapons brought on the boats and handed them to archers and musketeers, and he began planning how to attack the town. Entrance of Hern√°n Cort√©s into the city of Potonch√°n in 1519. On the day following March 13, 1519, the chaplain Juan D√≠az and Brother Bartolom√© of Olmedo, would officiate what would be the first Christian Mass in the continental territory of New Spain. Afterwards, Cort√©s sent Alonso de √Åvila with one hundred soldiers out on the road leading to the village, while Cort√©s and the other group of soldiers went in the boats. There, on the shore, Cort√©s made a \\"requerimiento\\" (requisition) in front of a notary of the king named Diego de Godoy, to let them disembark, thus issuing the first notarial act in Mexico.Colegio de Notiarios P√∫blicos de Tabasco. El Notariado en M√©xico The natives refused, telling the Spaniards that, if they disembarked, they would be killed. They began to shoot arrows at Cort√©s' soldiers, initiating combat. Alonso de √Åvila arrived to the combat developing within Potonch√°n with his hundred men who went traveled by land, making the Indians flee and take refuge in the mountains. In this manner, Cort√©s took possession of the great main square of Potonch√°n, in which there were rooms and great halls and which had three houses of idols. Battle of Centla The next day, Captain Cort√©s sent Pedro de Alvarado with a hundred soldiers so that he could go up to six miles inland, and he sent Francisco de Lugo, with another hundred soldiers, to a different part. Francisco de Lugo ran into warrior squads, starting a new battle. Upon hearing the shots and drums, Alvarado went in aid of Lugo, and together, after a long fight, they were able to make the natives flee. The Spaniards returned to town to inform Cort√©s. Hern√°n Cort√©s was informed by an Indian prisoner, that the Indians would attack the town, so he ordered that all horses be unloaded from the ships and that soldiers prepare their weapons. Battle of Centla. The next day, early in the morning, Cort√©s and his men went through plains to Cintla or Centla, subject towns of Potonch√°n, where the day before Alvarado and Lugo had fought against the natives. There they found thousands of Indians, beginning Battle of Centla. The Spaniards were attacked by Chontal Maya Indians. The Spaniards defended themselves with firearms like muskets and cannons, which produced terror in the Indians, but what terrified them more was seeing the Spanish cavalry, which they had never seen. The Indians believed that both rider and horse were one. In the end the Indians lost, owing primarily to the higher technology of the Spaniard's weapons. After the battle ended, Cort√©s and his men returned to Potonch√°n, and where they healed the wounded and buried the dead. On the following day, ambassadors sent by Tabscoob arrived at the Spanish camp with gifts because, according to Indian tradition, the loser must give gifts to the winner. Among the gifts were gold, jewelry, jade, turquoise, animal skins, domestic animals, feathers of precious birds, etc. Furthermore, the Indians gave the Europeans 20 young women, including a woman who has been referred to as Malintze,Townsend, Camilla. Malintzin's Choices. University of New Mexico Press, 2006, p. 55. Malintzin, and Malinalli by differing sources. The Spaniards gave her the name Dona Marina, and she served as counselor and interpreter for Cort√©s. Later, Cort√©s would have a son with her.

Its closest analogue probably is chili crab, however Padang crab uses richer spices. Origin The recipe derived from West Sumatran Padang style of seasoning seafood with rich, hot and spicy bumbu (spice mixture). The ground spice mixture includes shallot, garlic, red chili pepper, bird's eye chili, ginger, turmeric and candlenut. The most popular crab species used in this recipe is mud crab, however sometimes blue crab can also be used. Ingredients The crabs are boiled in hot water until medium done and cut into pieces, the hot water being used in the boiling process will be used as crab broth. The bumbu ground spices mixture includes garlic, shallot, bird's eye pepper, ginger, turmeric, candlenut and red chili pepper. The ground spice paste is stir fried briefly in palm oil to release its aroma, together with chopped onion, salam leaf (Indonesian bay leaf) and lemon leaf. Then the crab pieces are mixed with stir fried spice paste together with crab broth, scallion, tomato ketchup, chili sauce, oyster sauce, salt and pepper. Then the sauce is being thickened with beaten eggs. The Padang sauce crab tastes savoury, hot and spicy.

At least forty people were killed in the attack, according to eyewitnesses. Nineteen others were injured. The perpetrators of the attack were not clear, although media reports generally blamed Boko Haram.  Background  Mubi is located a few miles from the Cameroon‚ÄìNigeria border. It is one of three towns in northeastern Nigeria that have been under a state of emergency for more than a year. Even so, Adamawa State's attacks by the Boko Haram insurgency include massacres in Mubi in 2012, 2014, 2017 and 2018. Boko Haram is an Islamist terrorist group opposed to what they perceive as the Westernisation of Nigeria, which they say is the root cause of criminal behaviour in the country. Thousands of people have been killed in attacks perpetrated by the group, and the federal government declared a state of emergency in May 2013 in Borno State in its fight against the insurgency. The resulting crackdown, however, has failed to stabilise the country. Boko Haram's attacks intensified in 2014. In February, the group killed more than 100 Christian men in the villages of Baga, Borno and Izghe, Borno. Also in February, 59 boys were killed in the Federal Government College attack in Yobe State. In April 2014, the group abducted more than 200 school girls on the same day as a bombing attack in Abuja killed at least 88 people. By mid-April, Boko Haram had been blamed for nearly 4,000 deaths in 2014. At least 500 more people have been killed since then. After the kidnapping, international attention on the situation greatly intensified. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other nations pledged monetary and/or military support to combat Boko Haram. However, attacks continued. On 20 May 2014, 118 people were killed in a pair of bombings in Jos. The following day, two dozen people were killed in a raid on a village.  Attack  At approximately 6:30 pm local time (17:30 UTC), a bomb went off as spectators were leaving a football field in Kabang, Mubi. A number of shops were destroyed in the blast. One survivor described the scene: \\"After the commotion, I stood up covered with my own blood, but I realized that I was lucky to be injured as those who were not that lucky were shattered into pieces.\\" According to one eyewitness, the blast appeared to come from within a crowd of people walking across the field on their way home, possibly suggesting the attack was the work of a suicide bomber. However, other eyewitnesses said a car had delivered the explosives. A similar attack was attempted at a football field in Jos the previous weekend, but the would-be-suicide bomber blew up before reaching the target. Initial reports said 14 people were killed in the attack and 12 injured. The official death toll was upped to 18 with 19 injuries the next day. However, the actual death toll was much higher according to locals. A nurse said the morgue at the local hospital was \\"overcrowded\\" with 40 or more bodies; a police officer backed her report. An eyewitness who lost two family members said about 45 people had died.  Suspects  Media reports were quick to link the attack to Boko Haram. However, the area has also been subject to non-Boko Haram violence in recent years, so the perpetrators were not clear. On 2 June, a suspect was arrested by the military who had surrounded the city in hopes of catching the perpetrator. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the suspect's car at the scene of the bombing.  Reaction  Politicians including Adamawa State governor Murtala Nyako and the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, described the attack as barbaric. Nyako said the government was saddened by the attack, but called on citizens to remain calm and assist in the investigation. The military surrounded the town in an effort to catch those responsible for the attack.

The goal of the operation was to fly twelve Hawker Hurricanes from to Malta, guided by two Blackburn Skuas.  Background  On 11 June 1940, Italy began the Siege of Malta, the first step in their plan to gain control of the Mediterranean. Their plan was to bomb or starve Malta into submission, by attacking its ports, towns, cities, and Allied shipping supplying the island. After over a month of bombardment, the troops on Malta were beginning to run low on supplies -including aircraft- to help fight off the attackers, and some doubt was expressed whether Malta was worth the supplies it required, and some even planned on letting Malta work on the few supplies it had left. The decision was made, however, to reinforce substantially the island air defences.  Movement  The troops were informed of their mission, and the mission began. Between 0800 and 0830 hours on 31 July 1940, Force H (including ) left Gibraltar, heading for Malta. To hamper air resistance during the transportation, an air attack was planned on Cagliari, alongside Operation Spark, which was meant to distract the Italians by reporting a suspicious boat off the coast of Menorca. On the way to make the attack, Force H was attacked by two waves of enemy aircraft. The attacks, which took place on 1 August at around 1800 hours, took place northwest of the coast of the Gulf of Bougie. The attacks were successfully repelled. On 2 August, at around 0230 hours, nine torpedo bomber Reconnaissance aircraft armed with bombs, and three bombers with mines, took off from the Ark Royal, however, due to inclement weather, one plane crashed, losing its entire crew. This problem forced the pilots to wait until full daylight to take off, when the weather was better. The attack was fought off with considerable anti- aircraft fire, however, the pilots still managed to hit four of the hangars, and destroy or damage several aircraft. They also successfully laid three mines around the edge of the harbor. All but one aircraft returned from this mission, the sole loss being taken as prisoner after an emergency landing. Operation Spark was also reported as successful. After the operation, many of the forces of Force H, including , , Ark Royal and , left Force H to take part in the Battle of Dakar. All of the aircraft reached Malta.

Prior to her NOAA career, she was delivered to the United States Fish and Wildlife Services Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in 1967 and was transferred to NOAA in 1970, but was not placed in commission until 1977.  Construction and commissioning  Oregon II as she appeared when delivered to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in 1967.Oregon II was built for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at Ingalls Shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched in February 1967 and delivered to the Fish and Wildlife Service's Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in August 1967, but was not commissioned.NOAA Ship Oregon II Characteristics and Capabilities When NOAA was established on 3 October 1970, she became part of NOAA's fleet, and finally was commissioned on March 17, 1977, as NOAAS Oregon II (R 332).moc.noaa.gov OREGON II  Characteristics and capabilities  Oregon II is outfitted as a double-rigged shrimp trawler, longliner, gillnetter, fish trap hauler, and dredger.NOAA Ship Oregon II flier She has a hydraulic seine-trawl winch with a maximum pull of 30,000 pounds (13,610 kg) and drum capacity of 1,200 feet (366 meters) of 9/16-inch (14.3-mm) wire rope, and she has two outriggers for trawling. She also has two hydrographic winches with 0.322-inch (8.2-mm) EM cable, a hydraulic one with a maximum pull of 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) and a drum capacity of 12,139 feet (3,000 meters), and an electric one with a drum capacity of 13,123 feet (4,000 meters). She also has a self-contained hydraulic MOCNESS winch for the collection of zooplankton and nekton with a maximum pull weight of 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) and a drum capacity of 7,972 feet (2,430 meters) of 0.68-inch (17.3-mm) wire rope. She is equipped with a rotating telescoping boom crane with a lift capacity of 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg), a rotating crane with a lift capacity of 6,000 pounds (2,722 kg), and a J-frame with a maximum safe working load of 3,500 pounds (1,588 kg). Oregon II has various laboratory capabilities. A 275-square-foot (25.5-square-meter) wet laboratory is situated aft on her main deck. She also has a 100-square-foot (9.3-square-meter) biology laboratory, a 75-square-foot (7-square-meter) computer laboratory, and a 210-square-foot (19.5-square- meter) hydrographic laboratory. She has a scientific freezer forward. Oregon II carries an 18.2-foot (5.5-meter) rescue boat with a 90-horsepower (67-kW) motor and capable of carrying six people. Her crew includes a four-member dive team. Oregon II has undergone an upgrade in which she received new electronic fish detection equipment, environmental sensors, and deck-handling and electronics equipment. Her laboratory and living spaces were refurbished, her original Fairbanks Morse main engines were replaced by new, more powerful Caterpillar engines, and a bow thruster was added to improve both her station- keeping and shiphandling capability.NOAA Ship Oregon II Engineering  Service history  Operated by NOAAs Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, Oregon II conducts fishery and living marine resource studies in support of the research of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Pascagoula Laboratory in Pascagoula. The ship collects fish and crustacean specimens using trawls and benthic longlines and fish larvae, fish eggs, and plankton using plankton nets and surface and midwater larval nets. She normally operates in the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern United States, and the Caribbean Sea.NOAA Ship Oregon II Her home port is Pascagoula. Oregon IIs projects include summer and autumn groundfish surveys, summer shark longline surveys, and surveys of ichthyoplankton, marine mammals, and reef fish. She annually supports a striped bass survey and tagging effort by NMFSs Beaufort Laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina. On 16 March 1989, an engine fire broke out aboard Oregon II while she was moored at Mobile, Alabama. Her chief engineer, Mr. James V. Brosh, entered the smoke-filled engine room to make sure it was clear of personnel before discharging carbon dioxide into the area to fight the fire. He later personally directed Mobile Fire Department firefighters in extinguishing the blaze. His actions were credited with limiting the damage and saving the ship, and for his courage and heroism in ensuring the safety of personnel and in fighting the fire, he received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal later in 1989.NOAA History: Hall of Honor: Commerce Medals Presented For Lifesaving and the Protection of Property 1955-2000 In August 1998, Oregon II became the first United States Government ship to call at Havana, Cuba, since Fidel Castro took control of the country in 1959. She visited Cuba to take part with NOAAs Cuban counterparts in a survey of sharks in Cuban waters to help determine shark migration patterns in the waters of the United States, Cuba, and Mexico. Her work in Cuba supplemented similar work done in Mexican waters. On 28 February 1999, Oregon II was 25 nautical miles (46 km) off Cape Canaveral, Florida, bound for Pascagoula when she sighted two men and a woman clinging to a capsized 25-foot (7.6-meter) fishing boat in growing darkness and 6-to-8-foot (1.8-to-2.4-meter) seas. The three people had been unable to send any distress signal, had been in the water for about five hours, were beginning to suffer hypothermia, and were in real danger of perishing during the upcoming night when Oregon II rescued them. Oregon II transferred them to a United States Coast Guard cutter, which returned them to shore.Anonymous, \\"Crew Of Research Ship Rescues 3 Clinging To Boat,\\" Orlando Sentinel, March 5, 1999. For vigilant watchstanding and promptly rescuing the three people, Oregon II received the Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 1999. When NOAA retired the fisheries research ship NOAAS John N. Cobb (R 552) in August 2008, Oregon II became the oldest ship in the NOAA fleet. She achieved a milestone on 27 July 2012, when she departed Pascagoula on her 300th research cruise, an annual assessment of red snapper and shark populations in the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean. By that time, she had logged 10,000 days at sea and more than 1,000,000 nautical miles (1,850,000 km), and her projects had taken her as far south as the Amazon River delta in Brazil and as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts.Havens, April M., \\"NOAA ship Oregon II to leave Pascagoula on 300th research cruise,\\" gulflive.com, July 26, 2012, 4:20 PM Honors and awards 20px Department of Commerce Gold Medal 1999 In a ceremony in 1999 in Washington, D.C., Oregon II was awarded the Department of Commerce Gold Medal for \\"public service or heroism\\"Program of Fifty-First Annual Honor Awards, United States Department of Commerce, 1999: Gold Medal: NOAA Ship OREGON II, Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for her lifesaving efforts off Florida on 28 February 1999.

After Emil's death in 1867, his father Karl and uncle Robert took over the studio and, when he was old enough, he received his first training there along with his brothers Emil, Robert and Hugo, who would also become sculptors of some note. At the age of fifteen, his father took him on a study trip to Rome. After his father's death in 1885, he went to Berlin, where he worked in the studios of Albert Wolff and Reinhold Begas, passing the craftsman examination at Koblenz in 1887. This was followed by a year of military service. He spent the years 1891 to 1893 in London then, after a brief stay in Bad Kreuznach, lived in Berlin from 1895 to 1905. During that time, he worked on the Siegesallee (Victory Avenue) project of Wilhelm II, also producing statues for fountains and contributing to the National Kaiser Wilhelm Monument. After completing his part of the Siegesallee, he began working in a simpler style. In 1911, he was awarded the Villa Romana Prize and spent 1912 in Florence at the Villa as a guest of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund. He was appointed a Professor at the Prussian Academy of Arts in 1916. After World War I, he returned to Bad Kreuznach and concentrated mostly on funerary art. In 1941, the Nazi government issued a Berufsverbot (professional disqualification) against him.

It was formed with the amalgamation of the Anglo-Saxon hundreds of Patton and Culvestan during the reign of Henry I (1100 to 1135). Hundreds in England had various judicial, fiscal and other local government functions, their importance gradually declining from the end of manorialism to the latter part of the 19th century. The hundred is named after the village of Munslow, where the hundred's judicial and administrative functions were mostly carried out. The 'hundred house' for Munslow hundred was originally located in neighbouring Aston Munslow,Munslow historic parish registers but from the Tudor period was located in Munslow itself. Geography The hundred was divided into \\"upper\\" and \\"lower\\" divisions (the \\"lower\\" division being considerably larger). The hundred reached from All Stretton to the north, down the valleys of the rivers Onny, Corve and Teme, to the Herefordshire border south and west of Ludlow.GENUKI Shropshire hundreds (Gregory, 1824) Three towns came to exist in the hundred ‚Äî Ludlow (established alongside Ludlow Castle in the early 12th century), Church Stretton (granted a market charter in 1214) and Craven Arms (which grew as a railway town in Victorian times). The hundred has no detached parts, although the part consisting of Richard's Castle, Ashford Carbonell and Ashford Bowdler was practically detached, until the transfer of the remainder of Ludford in 1895. The liberty of Wenlock had three true enclaves within Munslow (the main part of the parish of Eaton together with Millichope, secondly the parish of Shipton, and a tiny third enclave being the township of Norncott) until reform of its borough in 1836 incorporated these parts into Munslow.GENUKI Miscellaneous, Shropshire The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland (1868) Formation The Domesday Book records that following the Norman conquest of England, many of the manors in the hundreds of Culvestan and Patton came to be owned by Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, including the manors of Corfham and Aston.Open Domesday Aston Corfham was already by 1066 (when it was held by King Edward) the caput (the centre of administration) for both Culvestan and Patton. It is believed that by the 12th century the caput for both hundreds was moved to Aston, northwest from Corfham Castle on the other side of the River Corve. Aston was near the tumulus known as Munslow and the place later became known as Aston Munslow. The hundreds of Shropshire were greatly reformed throughout the 12th century, and one of the earliest changes to be made was the formation of Munslow. During the reign of Henry I (1100 to 1135) the hundreds of Culvestan and Patton were formally merged (having been paired by a common caput for some time) and the new hundred formed was named Munslow. The new hundred included most of the manors of Culvestan (not Huntington, which went to Stottesdon) and Patton (not Madeley or Beckbury, both which went to Brimstree ‚Äî nor Acton, which went to Stottesdon). In addition a number of manors from the hundred of Leintwardine (which was being dissolved) were transferred, with a boundary between the new hundreds of Munslow and Purslow taken to be the Roman road running from Wistanstow south to the Herefordshire border (and explains why Rowton and Shelderton were in different hundreds to the rest of their respective parishes). Also brought into Munslow was a part of the parish of Richard's Castle, causing a division between Shropshire and Herefordshire there that still exists. =Later transfers to Wenlock= The move to Munslow hundred was relatively short-lived for many places, with the growth of the franchise (or liberty) of WenlockBritish History Online The Liberty and Borough of Wenlock beginning in the 1189-1199 reign of Richard I ‚Äî see the section in the Patton article. The resulting hundred of Munslow (following the removal of places to Wenlock) resembled quite closely the former hundred of Culvestan (with for example the upper division based on the former hundred's detached part in the vicinity of the Strettondale) as around half of the Patton element was removed. Parishes in 1824 Hundreds of Shropshire in 1832 The following parishes, or parts, formed the hundred in 1824, as recorded by A Gazetteer of Shropshire. This represents the area covered by the hundred for much of its history, from circa 1200 to 1836.

Although never formally abolished, the hundreds of England have become obsolete. They lost their remaining administrative and judicial functions in the mid-to-late 19th century, with the last aspects removed from them in 1895 with the Local Government Act 1894. The Act established a new system of local government within the counties, consisting of civil parishes and districts, both with elected councils. The districts steadily amalgamated and since 2009 Shropshire has only two, both unitary authorities, meaning the county currently has no level of local government between the county and the parish.

Excerpts available at Google Books. It is dedicated to the memory of Carl Theodor Dreyer. Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen is part of a series of short-films dedicated to relevant personalities of Portuguese arts and literature produced by the company Cultura Filmes (1967‚Äì69) with support from the Gulbenkian Foundation. Monteiro, at the time with no references besides having frequented the London School of Film Technique (1963‚Äì65), was recommended to Ricardo Malheiro (1909‚Äì77), the owner of Cultura Filmes and himself a director of documentary shorts, by Alberto Seixas Santos and Ant√≥nio Pedro Vasconcelos.Monteiro, Jo√£o C√©sar, ‚ÄúAuto-Entrevista‚Äù, O Tempo e o Modo, n¬∫ 69/70, 1969, in Nicolau, Jo√£o, ed., Jo√£o C√©sar Monteiro, Lisboa, Cinemateca Portuguesa ‚Äì Museu do Cinema, 2005. Initially, Monteiro was developing a project on 19th-century novelist Camilo Castelo Branco to be named Como Filmar Camilo? (How to Film Camilo?). The choice of the Gulbenkian Foundation to confine the series to living personalities made him turn to Sophia.Domingos, Nuno, Audio Interview with JCM, April 1999, in Integral Jo√£o C√©sar Monteiro (DVD collection), Volume I, First Four Films, Lisbon, Madragoa Filmes, 2003. The work opens with Monteiro reading the credits in voice-over. The poet is filmed among her children in the Algarve during the summer. An important source of inspiration to Sophia herself, the luminous region where Monteiro would shoot Hovering Over the Water (1986) is one of the essential matters of the film. The sea is its dominant element. Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen ends with the poet writing her name in a sheet that fades to white under the sound of the waves. Of his own films, Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen was probably the one more openly discussed by Monteiro. In a self-interview he wrote: > ‚Ä¶ I suppose, first of all, that it is the proof for those willing to > understand that poetry is not filmable and there is no point in pursuing it. > What is filmable is always something else that may or may not have a poetic > quality. My film is the realization of this impossibility, and this > uncompromising shame makes it, I believe, poetic, malgr√©-lui.

His books have been translated into 31 languages and, as of 2014, have sold over six million copies. He currently lives in Gilford, New Hampshire and he is Solofra honorary citizenGlenn Cooper a Solofra solofraoggi.it. The Library of the Dead trilogy is currently being adapted into a television series by Pioneer Pictures. Early life and education Cooper grew up in suburban New York. After graduating from White Plains High School, he attended Harvard University, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts in Archaeology. Next, he attended Tufts University School of Medicine, where he earned his medical degree in 1978. He completed an internship and residency in internal medicine at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a fellowship in infectious diseases at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He served as an emergency physician at the Khao-I-Dang Refugee Camp in Thailand, a position sponsored by the International Rescue Committee, and at the H√¥pital Albert Schweitzer in Haiti. He also worked for the U.S. Public Health Service, based in Lowell, Massachusetts, for two years. Corporate career In 1985, Cooper joined Eli Lilly and Company where he conducted research on new antibiotics. He held several research, clinical and regulatory positions at Lilly in the United States and England before joining the biotechnology company, Sphinx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in Durham, North Carolina in 1990 as executive vice president and chief operating officer. In 1992, he joined Progenitor, Inc. as president and chief executive officer. Then, in 1993, he joined Interneuron Pharmaceuticals in Lexington, Massachusetts, Progenitor‚Äôs parent company, as chairman and chief executive officer. Interneuron changed its name to Indevus Pharmaceuticals and Cooper remained as CEO until the company was purchased in 2009 by Endo Pharmaceuticals. While at Indevus, Cooper oversaw the FDA approval and commercial introduction of several drugs for urological and endocrinological conditions. He has served on the boards of directors of multiple public and privately held biotechnology companies. Writing career Cooper began writing over 20 years ago. He is quoted as saying that he always found that writing gave him a balance by mixing the rigors of his scientific life with his creative side. Initially, he concentrated on screenplays. Although a handful of his approximately 20 scripts have been optioned for development, none have made it into production. Cooper wrote his first novel, The Library of the Dead, based on the discovery of a vast, mysterious underground library of medieval texts. He approached 66 literary agents with the manuscript and 65 rejected it before Steve Kasdin at Sandra Dijkstra Literary Agency agreed to represent him. Kasdin, now at the literary agency Curtis Brown, Ltd., subsequently sold the novel to publishers throughout the world. That book and Cooper‚Äôs next six novels went on to become international bestsellers. The Italian literary critic Antonio D‚ÄôOrrico praised The Library of the Dead in the newspaper Corriere della Sera, writing, \\"Glenn Cooper has written one of the best-designed novels that I've read in 14 years.‚Äù Cooper added two more books to The Library of the Dead trilogy: Book of Souls and The Keepers of the Library. Each of these books features FBI special agent, Will Piper. In addition, Cooper has written two stand-alone thrillers: The Tenth Chamber and The Devil Will Come. The fact that his sales in Europe have exceeded those in the United States has been frequently noted by critics. Cooper‚Äôs novels are often rooted in historical events. In addition, each of his books spotlights a large philosophical theme: fate and predestination, the nature of evil, conceptions of the afterlife, resurrection, and the interface between science and faith. He is a sponsoring member of the International Thriller Writers.

It was while a member of this group that he came across a script by Michael and Shawn Rasmussen called Long Distance, which he rewrote. While Cooper was accepted into the Boston University Masters of Fine Arts program in film production, he chose to drop out and produce Long Distance through his company Lascaux Pictures, now known as Lascaux Media, instead of completing his MFA by producing a thesis film. The film, starring Monica Keena, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2005 and was sold for distribution in 30 countries. Cooper, through Lascaux Media, has produced two other independent genre films: Dark Feed and The Inhabitants.

hydrographic survey ship that was in commission in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from 1970 to 2002. Prior to her NOAA career, she was in commission in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1968 to 1970 as USC&GS; Ferrel (ASV 92). Construction and commissioning Ferrel was built as an \\"auxiliary survey vessel\\" (ASV) for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey at Zigler Shipyards in Jennings, Louisiana.NOAA History: Coast & Geodetic Survey Ships: FERREL She was completed in 1968 and commissioned in a ceremony at Zigler Shipyards on 4 June 1968NOAA Photo Library: Invitation to christening and commissioning ceremony for USC&GS; Ship FERREL on June 4, 1968 into Coast and Geodetic Survey service as USC&GS; Ferrel (ASV 92),Polmar, Norman, The Naval Institute Guide to the Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, Seventeenth Edition, Naval Institute Press: Annapolis, Maryland, 2001, , p. 610. sponsored by Mrs. Marion L. Land.Invitation to christening of NOAA Ship FERREL to be held on June 4, 1968 When the Coast and Geodetic Survey merged with other United States Government organizations to form NOAA on 3 October 1970, she became a part of the NOAA fleet as NOAAS Ferrel (S 492). Design and capabilities Ferrel was modified from the basic design for an offshore oil rig supply boat and was equipped specifically for oceanographic studies of coastal and inshore waters. She had a large open fantail for the handling of equipment, a crane aft, a trawl winch, an oceanographic winch located amidships, and an A-frame.NOAA Ship Ferrel Service history NOAAS Ferrel (S 492) in the Dry Tortugas area of Florida.The Coast and Geodetic Survey intended Ferrel to replace the survey ship USC&GS; Marmer and conduct current surveys in various harbors and waterways along the United States East Coast and United States Gulf Coast. During the 1970s, however, she became the primary platform for the NOAA Status and Trends Program and other environmental monitoring programs. Her home port was Charleston, South Carolina. In recognition of unusual competence in an emergency, excellent judgment, and superb seamanship, four members of Ferrels crew - Commander John K. Callahan, Jr., NOAA Corps; Lieutenant Commander Richard P. Floyd, NOAA Corps; Chief Boatswain's Mate David L. Brannon; and Surveyor Seaman Gordon R. Pringle - received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal in 1981 for effecting the rapid rescue of a passenger who fell overboard from a sightseeing vessel in New York Harbor.NOAA History: Hall of Honor: Commerce Medals Presented For Lifesaving and the Protection of Property 1955-2000 As Ferrel was docking at the Port of Corpus Christi in Texas on 17 September 1986, Evelyn Langanke fell from a bridge abutment near the ship into a 35-foot- (10.7-meter-) deep ship channel. Ferrels executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Ted I. Lillestolen, NOAA Corps, noted that Langanke was in trouble, ran from the ship, entered the water, and swam to the woman, who was thrashing feebly when he reached her. He made a proper lifesaving approach and towed the unconscious woman to shore. Commander Robert E. Hunt, NOAA Corps, and Lieutenant Paul E. Pegnato, NOAA Corps, both also of Ferrel, came to Langankes medical assistance, with Hunt using cardiopulmonary resuscitation to revive her and Pegnato administering oxygen and first aid to stabilize her condition. Langanke had suffered a partially collapsed lung, and their rescue and medical actions were crucial in saving her life. For saving and assisting Langanke, the three men received the Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 1987. Ferrel received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal in 1995 for coming to the aid of the sailboat Suncatcher, which was manned by three exhausted sailors, low on fuel, and unable to reach her destination in the midst of worsening weather. After locating Suncatcher, Ferrel rigged a float with a tow line, secured it to Suncatcher, and towed her to safety. Ferrel was decommissioned on 21 November 2002 and replaced by the research vessel NOAAS Nancy Foster (R 352). Following its decommissioning, Ferrel was sold to Reservoir Marine LLC, an oil exploration company based in Sugar Land, Texas. On 20 September 2017, while crewed by a family of two adults and two children, Ferrel issued a distress call at 2:30 AM after becoming caught in Hurricane Maria. The vessel capsized and was beached on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. One member of the crew, a British man, was killed, while the woman and two children were rescued.

It was advocated by Norman Platnick, Colin Patterson, Ronald Brady and others in the 1980s, but has few modern proponents. The book, Foundations of Systematics and BiogeographyWilliams, D. M. and M. C. Ebach. 2008. Foundations of Systematics and Biogeography. Springer Science+Business Media, New York. by David Williams and Malte Ebach provides a thoughtful history of the origins of this point of view. Patterns vs. processes The traditional approach to cladistics, which traces back to Willi Hennig,Hennig, W. 1950. Grundz√ºge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik. Deutscher Zentralverlag, Berlin.Hennig, W. 1966. Phylogenetic systematics. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL. groups together organisms based on whether or not they share derived characters or character states that are assumed to be descended from a common ancestor. Transformed cladists maintain that the assumption of common descent is uninformative and/or potentially misleading, and that therefore cladistic methods should be free from evolutionary process assumptions, and based only on parsimonious interpretation of empirical data: In other words, pattern cladists argue that the fewer evolutionary assumptions a classification presupposes, the fewer errors creep in, and greater transparency results. They draw a distinction between patterns, which are observed, and processes, which may be inferred from patterns, but which should not be presupposed. Before the emergence of cladistics as a school, Joseph Henry Woodger criticized phylogenetic systematics on the grounds that homology by way of common ancestry is \\"putting the cart before the horse, because descent from a common ancestor is something assumed, not observed. It belongs to theory, whereas morphological correspondence is observed.\\".Woodger, S. (1945). ‚ÄúOn Biological Transformations‚Äù. In: Essays on Growth and Form. Le Gros Clark, W. E., Medawar, P. B (eds.). Oxford: Clarendon Press. Colin Patterson later wrote similarly: Pattern cladists, like traditional cladists, think that classifications should be isomorphic to cladograms, recognizing groups based on nested patterns of synapomorphies, but they argue that the discovery of characters is not dependent on apriori considerations about common ancestry: Nelson & Platnick (1981) also noted that: \\"all of Hennig‚Äôs groups correspond by definition to patterns of synapomorphy. Indeed, Hennig‚Äôs trees are frequently called synapomorphy schemes. The concept of ‚Äòpatterns within patterns‚Äô seems, therefore, an empirical generalization.‚Äù Pattern cladists hence regard synapomorphies to be patterns free of processes. Criticism A frequent (but false) accusation against pattern cladistics is that its proponents claim that systematics should be \\"theory free.\\" At some point in the 1960s and '70s pheneticists may have believed that, but pattern cladists are not pheneticists. Obviously, rejecting a priori evolutionary process theories is not the same thing as categorically rejecting \\"theory\\" in toto. Furthermore, pattern cladists do not reject post hoc evolutionary explanations for cladograms, they simply think that the evidence is independent of the explanation.Brady, R. H. (1985). \\"On the independence of systematics\\". Cladistics. 1: 113-126. Nevertheless, some philosophers with a background conciliatory towards evolutionary taxonomy continue to offer criticisms in this vein: Of course, the distinction between the phenomenon and its explanation was clear to Darwin: \\"the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group, which from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my judgment fully explained.\\" Darwin, C. 1859. On the Origin of Species. John Murray, London, p. 413. Brady Brady, R. H. (1982). \\"Theoretical Issues and 'Pattern Cladistics'\\". Systematic Zoology. 3. 286-291.Brady, R. H. (1985). \\"On the independence of systematics\\". Cladistics. 1: 113-126. introduced to systematics the terms explanandum for empirical patterns (the phenomenon to be explained) and explanans for process theory (the explanation), writing: \\"by making our explanation into the definition of the condition [data] to be explained, we express not scientific hypothesis but belief\\". In the above quote, Darwin's \\"fact\\" is the explanandum; his theory of descent with modification is the explanans. In this view, whatever the characters imply as the preferred hypothesis of relationships becomes, de facto, \\"genealogical\\" when we explain it as a result of evolution.Brower, A. V. Z. 2002. Cladistics, phylogeny, evidence and explanation - a reply to Lee. Zool. Scripta 31:221-223. Creationist distortion As noted, transformed cladistics does not deny common ancestry, rather it argues a logical precedence: theories regarding processes should only be formulated after patterns are discovered. Creationists have distorted this to argue that there are pattern cladists who are skeptical about whether evolution occurs. =Colin Patterson= In November, 1981, Patterson delivered a seminar to the Systematics Discussion Group in the American Museum of Natural History.Patterson, C. 2002. Systematics and creationism. The Linnean 18:13-37. In the talk, Patterson asked provocatively: \\"Can you tell me anything about evolution, any one thing that is true?\\", and remarked: A creationist in the audience taped segments of Patterson's talk to imply he was \\"agnostic\\" on the subject of evolution.Colin Patterson: Evolution, Reports of the National Center for Science Education To his dismay, Patterson soon found his name quoted in creationist publications: (Note that a transcript of Patterson's talk has been published in the Linnean 18(2),and may be downloaded from the Linnean Society).

Stoneking, M. (2011). Denisova admixture and the first modern human dispersals into Southeast Asia and Oceania. The American Journal of Human Genetics, 89(4), 516-528. According to the Two Layer Hypothesis, early indigenous Australo-Melanesian peoples comprised the first population of Southeast Asia before their genetic integration with a second wave of inhabitants from East Asia, including Southern China, during the agricultural expansion of the Neolithic.Matsumura, H., Oxenham, M.F., Dodo, Y., Domett, K. Thuy, N.K., Cuong, N.L.,... Yamagata, M. (2008). Morphometric affinity of the late Neolithic human remains from Man Bac, Ninh Binh Province, Vietnam: key skeletons with which to debate the 'two layer' hypothesis. Anthropological Science, 116(2), 135-148Matsumura, H., Hudson, M.J. (2005). Dental perspectives on the population history of Southeast Asia. American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 127(2), 182-209. The majority of evidence for the Two Layer Hypothesis consists of dental and morphometric analyses from archaeological sites throughout Southeast Asia, most prominently Thailand and Vietnam. The credibility of the Two Layer Hypothesis has been criticized due mainly to similarities between Southeast Asian and Chinese cranial and dental characteristics, excluding Australo-Melanesians.  History  The first fossilized skeletal remains and indication of early 'Proto-Australian' Southeast Asian inhabitants surfaced in 1920 during an excavation by Dubois on the island of Java.Dubois, E. (1921). The proto-Australian fossil man of Wadjak, Java. Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Weteschappen Proceedings Series B Physical Sciences, 23, 1013-1051. Despite this, a formal connection to mainland Southeast Asia and the suggestion of an initial population of Australomelanesoids was not suggested until 1952 by Koenigswald in his response to Hooijer,Koenigswald, G.H.R. (1952). Evidence of a prehistoric Australomelanesoid population in Malaya and Indonesia. Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 8(1), 92-96. who sharply criticized the attribution of 'big toothed' dental remains to early Australo-Melanesians.Hooijer, D.A. (1950). Fossil Evidence of Austromelanesian Migrations in Malaysia? Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 6(4), 416-422. The immigration hypothesis proposed by Koenigswald was formally termed the 'Two Layer' model by Jacob Teuku. In 1967, Teuku analyzed the cranial and dental proportions of 152 adult skeletal samples recovered from prehistoric sites in Malaysia and Indonesia, the majority displaying robust jaws and teeth, prominent glabellae, and slender, elongated limbs. Teuku argued these characteristics correspond to the Australo-Melanesian population proposed by Koenigswald that predated the East Asian immigrants of the Neolithic; also suggesting the initial inhabitants were likely forced south of Southeast Asia's mainland by the second wave of migrants, due to resource competition or conflict.Jacob, T. (1967). Some problems pertaining to the racial history of the Indonesian region: a study of human skeletal and dental remains from several prehistoric sites in Indonesia and Malaysia. Drukkerij Neerlandia.  Archaeological evidence  = Thailand = Excavations at Moh Khiew Cave resulted in the discovery of a Late Pleistocene female human skeleton, an AMS radiocarbon date on a charcoal sample that was gathered from the burial grave gave an age of 25,800 +/- 600 BP. Measurements such as the bimaxillary breadth, upper facial height, bicondylar breadth, mandibular length, nasal breadth and height, palatal height, and mandibular angle were compared from the cranial and dental area to other female human specimens from East Asia and the Southwest Pacific regions. Twelve measurements were used in total for the statistical comparison in addition to 14 buccolingual crown diameters of the maxillary and mandibular teeth.Matsumura, H., & Pookajorn, S. (2005). A morphometric analysis of the Late Pleistocene human skeleton from the Moh Khiew Cave in Thailand. HOMO- Journal of Comparative Human Biology, 56(2), 93-118. After a comparison was completed the closest sample to the Moh Khiew Cave sample is the Late Pleistocene Coobool Creek from Australia. The next closest sample is the modern Australian Aborigines. However, those from Flores, Vietnam, and Thailand are distant samples in comparison. This discovery suggests that the Moh Khiew Cave skeleton may have shared a common ancestor with Australian Aborigines and Melanesians and also supports the ‚ÄòTwo Layer‚Äô hypothesis. = Vietnam = A study conducted in 2005, examined and compared permanent teeth from 4,002 individuals found in 42 prehistoric and historic samples throughout East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Melanesia. Metric dental traits were denoted by mesiodistal and buccolingual crown diameters. Measurements were taken as maximum diameters and male individuals were primarily measured because males generally have larger teeth and therefore show more differences. One culture that was prevalent during this time was the ƒêa B√∫t culture which occurred during 6000-5000 BP. The metric and nonmetric dental analyses of the ƒêa B√∫t resulted in one culture that are highly differentiated from the East Asians. A cluster analysis of the transformed Q-mode correlation coefficients of the dental crown measurements, showed a major cluster with Australo- Melanesians. Da But also has similarities with Australo-Melanesians in tooth size proportions and nonmetric traits. These close traits indicates a likeness with Australo-Melanesians.  Modern debates and controversies  The main controversy concerning the 'Two Layer' hypothesis is whether or not the evolutionary process truly involved the Australo-Melanesians. Archaeologists such as Matsumura suggest Southern Chinese people comprised the initial population of Southeast Asia, rather than Australo-Melanesians while researchers such as Turner argue that prehistoric Southeast Asians did not mix with either racial group.Turner, C. (1992). The Dental Bridge between Australia and Asia: Following Macintosh into the East Asian Hearth of Humanity. Archaeology in Oceania, 27(3), 143-152. Though the early prehistoric Vietnamese and Malaysians both resembled the Australo-Melanesian samples the most, the M√°n B·∫°c people had a greater resemblance to the ƒê√¥ng S∆°n samples dating back to the Iron Age. Analyzing cranial and dental remains, Matsumura concluded based on chronological differences that the M√°n B·∫°c people were immigrants affiliated with peoples near the Yangtze River region in Southern China. Molecular anthropologists have used classical genetic markers and mtDNA to analyze the similarities between early Chinese and Southeast Asians. Such genetic markers suggest the genetic layout of Southern Chinese peoples is quite similar to that of Southeast Asians. Other controversies completely reject the 'Two Layer' hypothesis. Using dental evidence, Turner‚Äôs Sundadont/Sinodont hypothesis suggests the ‚ÄúSundadont‚Äù trait seen in present- day Southeast Asians is a result of long-standing continuity. Turner created a cluster analysis of MMD values in order to test existing hypotheses of origins, concluding that all Southeast Asians, Micronesians, Polynesians, and Jomonese form their own branch and descend from a common ancestor. The Australians and Melanesians, however, are scattered over the African and European branch along with a side branch of Tasmanians and Solomon Islanders. Howell analyzed crania of major racial branches worldwide, and linked Australian and Melanesian cranial morphology most closely with African cranials. Howell discovered, however, that the size and features of present- day Asian cranial morphology differed significantly from that of Australians, Melanesians, and Africans.

The second named storm of the season, Bella originated in the middle of January 1991 from a surge in the monsoon trough to the southwest of Sumatra. For several days, the system remained weak as it moved generally west-southwestward. On January 25, it intensified to tropical storm status, but Bella took three more days to intensify to tropical cyclone status, with 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres per hour (75 miles per hour). The cyclone attained peak intensity on January 29, officially reaching winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center unofficially estimated winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), the highest the agency estimated for any storm in the Southern Hemisphere in the year. Bella later turned to the southeast and weakened, passing about 50 km (30 mi) west of Rodrigues on January 31\\\\. The storm turned to the south-southwest and back to the southeast again, becoming extratropical on February 4\\\\. While passing near Rodrigues, Bella produced strong winds and high tides, the latter of which caused flooding in the capital Port Mathurin. The storm was considered the worst on the island in 20 years. About 1,500 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving 1,000 people homeless. Bella also severely damaged crops, roads, and the power grid on Rodrigues. The storm killed about half of the Rodrigues flying fox, a critically endangered species. Elsewhere, Bella was believed to have sunk a Madagascar cargo ship, with its 36 people on board. Meteorological history Similar to Cyclone Alison that had formed in early January 1991, a surge in the monsoon trough spawned what would become Tropical Cyclone Bella, associated with the intertropical convergence zone. On January 13, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a system about 660 km (410 mi) southwest of Padang, Sumatra in the Australian basin. Moving to the west-southwest, the system crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on January 17, and the next day was tracked by the M√©t√©o France office in R√©union (MFR). On January 20, the disturbance turned sharply to the south-southeast, although its westward motion resumed late the following day, influenced by a ridge to the south. On January 22, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression. The JTWC upgraded the storm to tropical storm status on January 23, three days after classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. On January 25, the MFR upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bella, a week after beginning to issue advisories. Around that time, the storm became visible on MFR satellite imagery. Following a lengthy period of minimal development, Bella subsequently intensified at a more regular rate as it slowed its forward motion. On January 26, it turned more to the southwest, but the westward track resumed on the next day. Aided by warm sea surface temperatures of , Bella began to intensify quickly. On January 28, both the JTWC and the MFR upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating winds of 120 km/h (75 mph); this made Bella a tropical cyclone, the first of the season. Around this time, the storm developed a well-defined eye 60 km (35 mi) in diameter. After becoming a tropical cyclone, Bella continued to intensify, reaching peak winds on January 29\\\\. The MFR estimated 10 minute winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), and assessed a barometric pressure of at that time. Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated 1 minute peak winds of 240 km/h (150 mph); this strength, equivalent to a super typhoon, was the highest the JTWC estimated for any Southern Hemisphere storm during the tropical cyclone year. On January 30, Bella turned to the southeast and began weakening, affected by wind shear in the region. The cyclone passed about 50 km (30 mi) west of Rodrigues at 03:00 UTC on January 31, with 10 minute winds of 135 km/h (85 mph). Shortly thereafter, the cyclone deteriorated into a tropical storm. The southeast trajectory was short-lived, as Bella turned more to the south-southwest on February 1. After a final turn to the southeast, Bella became an extratropical cyclone on February 4. Impact and aftermath Before Bella affected land, a class one warning, the lowest of four, was issued for R√©union, while a class four warning was issued for Rodrigues. While moving near Rodrigues, Bella produced wind gusts of 210 km/h (130 mph), along with high tides that flooded the northern coastline, including the capital Port Mathurin. The storm damaged 1,200 homes and destroyed 300 others, leaving about 1,000 people homeless. About 30 schools were wrecked. The storm damaged about 75% of the electrical network was damaged, which also disrupted water supply on the island, and about 30% of roads were damaged. Over 90% of the crops on the island were destroyed, with many livestock killed. Cyclone Bella killed about half of the Rodrigues flying fox, a critically endangered species, decreasing the numbers from around 800 to around 400. The species had regrown from a minimum of around 70 in 1971, and the trend toward regrowth continued after the storm, reaching about 3,500 in 2002. The storm also affected the Rodrigues warbler. The storm also injured nine people, and overall, Bella was considered the worst storm on the island in 20 years. A 16,570 ton cargo ship traveling from Madagascar to R√©union was lost on January 30 about 700 km (430 mi) to the south of the center of Bella. The ship likely sank due to the cyclone, with 36 people on board. In the aftermath of the storm, seven people contracted Typhoid fever on Rodrigues in relation to the storm. After Bella passed, the government of Mauritius noted the need for 4,500 m (15,000 ft) of galvanized pipes to assist in rebuilding, as well as generators. The United States Agency for International Development donated $25,000 (1991 USD) to Mauritius to help in the aftermath. France, the United Kingdom, and India also donated to the country.

It was adopted by the people of Telangana as a representation of the Goddess of Telangana and Telangana dialect. History The original Telangana Thalli statue was designed by B. Venkataramana Chari, a [nirmal] resident, and installed at TRS office in Jubilee Hills in 2003. Venkataramana drew inspiration from KCR, the agitation leader's words questioning the existence of Telugu Thalli in Telangana region. The initial design was further improved akin to Bharat Mata, goddess mother. He was accoladed by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the eve of Independence day in year 2015 at Golconda, Hyderabad for his dedication. Symbolism Soon after the statue was released in 2003, Telangana Thalli became a symbolic representation during the agitation of Telangana people for a separate State and was adopted by people as the representation of the Goddess similar to Telugu Thalli. During the Telangana agitation for a separate state, people rejected the idea of Telugu Thalli, which earlier was Andhra Mata not out of disrespect, but to drive home the aspirations of a separate identity for Telugu people from Telangana region. The Statue The Goddess statue with a crown, holds maize corn (harvest) in one hand, reflecting prosperity of the region, while Bathukamma, the unique, cultural symbol of Telangana, will be in other hand. A new Telangana Thalli statue is designed and sculpted by Department of Sculpture, Potti Sriramulu Telugu University (PSTU), as a tribute to the first World Telugu Conference held in December 2017 at Hyderabad, Telangana.

Stony Creek was mentioned in colonial times in reference to the eponymous Tasmanian Aboriginal tribe (the Tyerrernotepanner clan) that still bears this name. Llewellyn first appears in early newspapers in 1845 as both being surveyed as a township and then also as a site of a murder. A hotel was opened in Llewellyn in 1873 by a publican from Campbell Town and by 1886 a siding was created, with a trestle bridge over Stony Creek, but, by this time, the inn was decreasingly patronised. By 1899 the town was busy enough to have hosted two horse race meetings in that year and the village had expanded to include at least two streets, but by 1903 hotel had already closed as business in the area declined. In this year it was recorded that the town had only the school as a public building, with the post office being contiguous with a private residence. The town now is a ghost of its former self and remains a mapped locality and railway siding.

In 1869 he established the Spring Valley Brewery in Yamate, Yokohama, Japan. Spring Valley Brewery was one of Japan's first beer breweries, and in 1907 became the founding production facility of Kirin Brewery Company, one of Japan's largest domestic beer producers. Early life Copeland was born Johan Martinius Thoresen in Arendal in Norway. In the 1840s, Copeland worked for five years as an apprentice to a German brewmaster a few blocks from his home before immigrating to the United States and changing his name to William Copeland.en.japantravel.com Work in Japan Moving to Yokohama, Japan in 1864, Copeland first worked in the dairy business and then set himself up as a brewer in 1869 with the Spring Valley Brewery. It was located at the site of a natural spring next to the Amanuma Pond below the Yamate foreign residential neighborhood, where he dug a 210-meter cave into the side of a hill and used its low fixed temperature to help the beer mature. After Louis Pasteur invented pasteurization, Copeland was quick to adopt the new technique in his factory. Copeland produced three varieties of beer: a lager beer, a Bavarian beer, and a Bavarian Bock beer. His beer was principally sold in casks to local Yokohama taverns with a small amount of bottled beer being made available to foreign residents in Yokohama, and then was shipped to Tokyo and Nagasaki. He went back to Norway and married Anne Kristine Olsen in 1872. They lived in Japan but she became sick and died seven years later. Although Copeland showed talent as a beer brewer, he was a poor manager, and in 1884 Spring Valley Brewery was put up for public auction. With the assistance of Scottish merchant Thomas Blake Glover, the Spring Valley Brewery was sold in early 1885 to a group of Japanese investors and renamed The Japan Brewery.Alexander, Brewed in Japan, p.18. German brewmaster Hermann Heckert was hired to oversee production. Glover was also instrumental in establishing a sales agency contract with Meidi-ya for the relaunched brewery, Kirin Beer, which was launched in May 1888. William Copeland's grave, maintained by Kirin Brewery Company, is located in the Foreigner's Cemetery in Yamate, Yokohama. The site of the former Spring Valley Brewery is now occupied by Kitagata Elementary School. Monuments and water wells visible at the edge of the school grounds attest to the site's history. Revival of the Spring Valley Brewery Brand In July 2014 Kirin Company, Limited announced its intention to revive the Spring Valley Brewery brand as a wholly owned subsidiary company to focus on producing and retailing microbrewery-style beers produced using traditional ingredients and brewing methods.

The priest holds Paul at gunpoint in order to steal his horse, but Paul has Abbie attack him; the drifter then takes the bullets out of the priest's revolver and his water canteen, then goes on his way.

In the local tavern, Paul meets Deputy Gilly Martin, who challenges the drifter to a fight when Paul ignores his attempt to start a conversation. In order to coax him out of the tavern, Gilly approaches Abbie, but Paul knocks him out. Gilly's fianc√©e Ellen rushes to his aid as Paul makes his way into the town's hotel. Ellen's younger sister Mary-Anne works at the hotel and draws Paul and Abbie a bath to thank him for having stood up to Gilly. Later, Paul finds the Marshal, Gilly's father Clyde Martin, waiting for him in the inn's lobby. The Marshal identifies Paul as an ex-soldier, and requests he leave Denton and never return. Before Paul moves on, Mary-Anne gives him a picture to remember her by. That night, Paul and Abbie are found by Gilly and his henchmen Roy, Tubby and Harris. They label Paul an Army deserter and traitor, kill Abbie and push Paul off a cliff. An injured Paul awakens the next day, buries Abbie and swears revenge. On his way back to the town, Paul again encounters the priest and steals his mule and revolver. Back in Denton, Mary-Anne shelters Paul at her father's house and offers help. She begs Paul to take her away from the town once he gets revenge. He refuses, telling her that he abandoned his wife and daughter to enlist and never intends to return. At the hotel, Paul kills Roy in a bathroom. The Marshal is alerted to the situation and has the men prepare for a fight. He orders Gilly to stay behind to keep the women safe. Gilly accuses Mary-Anne of aiding Paul and while arguing Ellen reveals to Gilly that she is pregnant. On the roof of the jailhouse, Paul shoots Harris when the latter at gunpoint refuses to shoot at Tubby and the Marshal. Inside the jailhouse, upset at the deaths of Roy and Harris, Tubby is unable to cope with the bloodshed and throws down his gun. Paul shoots Tubby in the back through a window. The Marshal agrees to leave his weapons inside so that they can talk. Gilly then comes out to end Paul, but the Marshal refuses to get out of the way. Gilly and Paul proceed to shoot at each other with the Marshal in the way, fatally shooting him in the process. Paul is wounded and hides in a barn. When Gilly enters, Paul slips a noose over his head and hangs him then proceeds to beat him then relents. As Gilly draws a knife, Mary-Anne appears and shoots him in the back. Mary-Anne and Paul make their way back to the inn, Ellen finds Gilly's body. The priest wanders back through Denton and Paul suggests that he should stay.

Harrison Sweeney as William T. Baxter * Tommy Nohilly as Tubby * Jumpy as Abbie Production =Pre-production= The film was written and directed by Ti West, in collaboration with Jason Blum of Blumhouse Productions and Universal Pictures. West also served as a producer for the project, alongside Blum, Jacob Jaffke and Peter Phok. In July 2014, Blum discussed his involvement with the film, \\"After Ethan [Hawke] and I did Sinister and The Purge, he really, really wanted to do a Western ... It took about a year to find In a Valley of Violence ... which is Ti West's movie.\\" He added about what drew him to the project, \\"[West's] approach to filmmaking, I love. He pitched me this idea and I thought it was really cool.\\" In March 2016, West revealed in an interview he had written the role with Hawke in mind. On March 18, 2014, The Hollywood Reporter announced that the film would star John Travolta and Ethan Hawke in main roles, with Hawke portraying the film's protagonist Paul, and Travolta portraying the Marshal Clyde Martin, who has a wooden leg. On May 22, 2014, Deadline Hollywood reported that Taissa Farmiga had been cast as Mary-Anne, a young innkeeper. The following day, Karen Gillan was cast as Ellen, the sister of Farmiga's character. On June 3, 2014, it was announced that James Ransone had been cast in the final main role of Deputy Gilly Martin, the fianc√© of Ellen and the son of the Marshal. While promoting the film, West spoke about finding a \\"talented\\" dog to fill the role of Abbie, Paul's canine companion. The part was given to Jumpy, whose trainer, Omar von Muller, also trained Uggie, the late star of The Artist (2011). =Filming= Principal photography for the project began on June 23, 2014, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and lasted approximately five weeks, 25 days in total. The film was shot on 35mm film. A makeshift Western town was built at Cerro Pelon Ranch in Galisteo, New Mexico for the duration of production and was used as the primary location for filming. The elaborate set consisted of a saloon, ramshackle houses, train tracks and a feed-and-seed store. The film's cinematographer, Eric Robbins, revealed that since they were shooting on film, footage wouldn't be seen for several days. Travolta finished filming his scenes on July 16, 2014. Gillan wrapped her scenes on July 18, and Farmiga completed her scenes the following day, on July 19, 2014. On July 26, 2014, Ti West announced on his Twitter account that principal photography for the film had concluded. =Post- production= West edited the film in Burbank, California. On September 8, 2014, West appeared on Bret Easton Ellis' podcast and discussed the filming process of In a Valley of Violence, stating, \\"It's a Western from the first shot, so I'm really interested to hear people calling it slow burn ... It's a Western from frame one to the end frame, so there's no 'and then it became a Western' ‚Äì it's always a Western. And that's kind of refreshing for me to make. It's just been artistically a pleasure to do.\\" On April 22, 2015, a raw cut of the film was test screened at the ArcLight cinema in Pasadena, California. In late September 2015, West stated on his official Twitter account that the film was in the final stages of post-production. Soundtrack On January 12, 2015, it was announced that composer Jeff Grace had been hired to write the musical score for the film, marking the fourth time Grace has scored for Ti West, having previously composed music for three of West's feature films: Trigger Man (2007), The House of the Devil (2009), and The Innkeepers (2011). The soundtrack album, featuring Grace's original score, was released via digital download by Back Lot Music on the same day as the film's theatrical and VOD release: October 21, 2016. Distribution =Marketing= On August 17, 2015, the first still image from the film was released in black and white, featuring Ethan Hawke riding a horse. Two more images were released on February 25, 2016, along with a more detailed plot synopsis.

Andrew Barker for Variety wrote, \\"Stripping its gunslinger plot down to the most essential pillars, the film has plenty of incidental pleasures to offer: a few chuckles, some typically Westian explosions of violence, a deliriously fun score, and a pair of perfectly solid performances from Ethan Hawke and John Travolta.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter, who in his review praised the performance of Hawke but found Travolta miscast, wrote of the film, \\"A genre revival that's always enjoyable, even when suffering a minor personality crisis near the end.\\" Bill Goodykoontz of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"... what makes In a Valley of Violence a notch better than a simple genre exercise is West's sense of fun. Occasionally he overindulges it, but it serves the film well.\\" References External links   2016 films 2010s comedy thriller films 2010s Western (genre) films American films American comedy thriller films American Western (genre) films Blumhouse Productions films Films directed by Ti West Films produced by Jason Blum Films set in the 1890s Films shot in New Mexico Focus Features films Universal Pictures films ","title":"In a Valley of Violence"},{"id":"42960525","text":"Compsibidion psydrum is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Off-Broadway and out of town shows displayed a wider array of moral stances, ranging from gentle persuasion of Florence (1949) by Alice Childress and the religious fervor of Trial by Fire (1947) by George Dunne to the activism of Earth and Stars (1946) by Randolph Edmonds. While musicals dominated commercial theatre in the 1940s, four dramas about the African Americans addressed the nations racial dilemma. The first, Richard Wright's, Native Son (1941), opened at the St. James Theatre on Broadway on 24 March 1941. Wright's novel had firmly laid the responsibility for Bigger's brutality on the doorstep of white America, but in adapting the novel to the stage, Paul Green, a southern folk dramatist, had insisted that Bigger take some responsibility for the murders he had committed.Hill, Errol, and James Vernon Hatch. A History of African American Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2003. Print. John Houseman and Orson Welles preferred Wright's original concepts and discarded the modifications made by Green, which had softened Bigger's character. When Green saw the play he was angered and later published his own version. Canada Lee created the role of Bigger Thomas, receiving near unanimous praise from the critics. The production ran for 114 straight performances before touring major US cities and returning to New York to run for an additional eighty-four performances before closing, in part because of America's declared war on 7 December 1941, which had refocused the nation's attention. The second civil rights drama, Strange Fruit (1945), set in a small Georgia town, had been adapted from Lilian Smith's controversial novel. Staged by Jos√© Ferrer, the play featured 23-year-old Jane White as Nonnie, a black girl made pregnant by a white boy played by Mel Ferrer. Other Blacks in the cast were Juano Hernandez, Edna Thomas, Alonzo Bosan, Ken Renard, and Dorothy Carter. Robert Earl Jones played the lynch victim. The play lasted for sixty performances, in part because Eleanor Roosevelt wrote enthusiastically about it in her syndicated column, ‚ÄúMy Day.‚Äù After the Allies defeated Germany and Japan in 1945, black soldiers returned home to segregated housing. On Whitman Avenue (1946), a civil rights drama on discrimination in the renting and sale of housing, starred Canada Lee, this time playing a decorated war hero trying to move his family into a white neighborhood. Abbie Mitchell, Augustus Smith, and Peter Morell played the members of Lee's family. Margo Jones, from Dallas, Texas, directed the drama, which was written by Maxine Wood. In response to unenthusiastic reviews, Eleanor Roosevelt observed in her weekly column that the American people were in a period of retrogression and did not want to be reminded of their shortcomings. With Roosevelt's help and that of Langston Hughes, the play remained alive for 148 performances.Hill, Errol, and James Vernon Hatch. A History of African American Theatre.

Born April 6, 1950, he is the only child of Nathan Katz (accountant) and Rosalyn Anker (talent agent, entertainer, lapidary shop owner, and founder of Animals in Distress). He grew up in Queens, New York, but moved with his family to Merrick, N.Y. in 1962. He was a recognized child prodigy in electronic engineering, able to read and draw schematic diagrams before he could read and write English.Hunt, William. \\"Young Electronics Genius Experimented at Age 2.\\" Long Island Sunday Press, January 1, 1961. Rather than send their only child away to a boarding school for gifted children, his parents arranged for home-schooling, which was continued until Katz' mid-teens when he began auditing college level courses at local universities. Education Eventually Katz enrolled in undergraduate studies at Stony Brook University, part of the State University of New York. Katz rapidly advanced through mathematics, psychology, psychophysiology, physics, and biology. As a graduate student in mathematics at Stony Brook University, he published a new method of factor rotation,Katz, Jeffrey Owen, and Rohlf, F. James. \\"Functionplane: A new approach to simple structure rotation.\\" Psychometrika, March 1974, Vol. 39, No. 1, pp. 37-51 programmed (in Fortran) a portion of the Numerical Taxonomy Systems Package, and published a number of papers in refereed journals. In the mid-1970s, Katz was invited to enroll at the University of Lancaster in England, where his academic interests and expertise coalesced in the application of mathematics and psychometrics to the study of psychophysiology and genetics via sophisticated instrumentation which he designed and built. Katz's graduate studies were interrupted by an extended critical illness during which time he returned to his family home in the U.S. In 1983, Katz received a Ph.D. from the University of Lancaster, England, under the mentorship of both Phillip Levy, Chair of Lancaster's Psychology Department, and Hans Eysenck, psychometrician and founder of the Psychology Department at the University of London. Despite the offer of a teaching and research position in Dr. Eysenck's department, after graduation Katz returned to Long Island to be close to his family. Research After graduation, Katz held several research positions. He worked for the Brain Research Laboratories (New York University) developing neurometric systems based on the multivariate statistical analysis of electroencephalographic signals (EEG). He later worked for HeartMap, a biomedical company, where he headed the design, hardware prototyping, software development and testing of a 64-channel cardiac monitor with special analytic capabilities, including neural network pattern recognition and the ability to generate 3-D images of the electrical potentials across the surface of the heart. He also worked for the American Society for Psychical Research. where he developed experimental protocols, conducted data analysis, as well as designed and built low noise instrumentation for a variety of psycho physiological and physical experiments. In 1989, Katz founded and became CEO of Scientific Consultant Services, Inc. (www.scientific-consultants.com), a firm that provides advanced solutions to difficult data handling problems in diverse fields. To that end, he developed sophisticated artificial intelligence software (neural networks and genetic algorithms). His clients have ranged from the U.S. Navy to the Swedish Lumber Authority; major asset management firms to individual investors. His accomplishments include the development of the first commercially available neural network model that forecasts the date, direction and degree of S&P; 500 and OEX turning points from one day to months in advance (NexTurn); the development of the first 32-bit neural network development tool for PCs (N-Train); and the development of the first neurogenetic development tool, designed for the genetic evolution of neural networks (LogiVolve). In addition, Katz served as Managing Principal and Director of Trading and System Development of Blackhorn Asset Management, LLC (2005‚Äì2008); Technical Director of Interactive Software Laboratories, Inc. (1995‚Äì1998), a firm offering data, data management tools and predictive software to the financial community; and Co-Founder, Vice President, and Director of Software Development, Datatek, Inc. (1990‚Äì1993), a consulting and trading system development firm. Throughout his life, Katz has given generously of his time and resources to various nonprofit causes, ranging from animal welfare to science education. He has lectured and taught classes at all levels of academia and at private organizations, has published extensively in several fields (in refereed journals, trade magazines, anthologies) and, with his wife, co-authored three books for McGraw-HillKatz, Jeffrey Owen, and McCormick, Donna L.

Astronomy and Custer Institute From 2003-2013, Katz devoted substantial time to one of his main passions: science education. During that period, he established research and internship programs at the Custer Institute, Inc., where he also served on the Board of Directors (2003‚Äì2013), as Observatory Director (2004‚Äì2012), and as Research Chair (2006‚Äì2012).

He revitalized the Institute's amateur radio and radio astronomy programs and was pivotal in arranging the donation and installation of a 55-foot crank-up radio tower from the Great South Bay Amateur Radio Club (of which he is still a member). Katz's latest research endeavor is the development of a multi- schedule survey of symptomatology and treatment of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.http://www.scientific-consultants.com/cfs-main.html Nearly 5000 respondents have participated in this study, which revealed important correlations between a number of factors, including the relationship between thyroid conditions and these disorders.

Books about the history and culture of Northern Ontario were the publishing arm's primary interest, although the company also published some fiction and poetry titles by local authors, as well as how-to and humour titles. In addition to its physical store, the shop also maintained an extensive mail order business, as well as a search service for people interested in purchasing rare or out-of-print books, and frequently travelled throughout Ontario to sell books at regional fairs and festivals. At its peak, the store had over 300,000 titles in stock\\"A paradise for browsers in the Northern Ontario bush\\".

Set in Mumbai, the book follows the story of Mohan Karekar, a pensive letter-writer living in the fictional housing complex of Saraswati Park. When his gay nephew, Ashish, moves in with him and his wife, Lakshmi, their mundane life goes through several changes. Saraswati Park was Joseph's debut novel for which she was awarded the Betty Trask Prize, Desmond Elliott Prize and Crossword Book Award. It was also nominated for The Hindu Literary Prize. Plot Mohan Karekar is a pensive letter-writer who lives with his wife, Lakshmi, in the housing complex of Saraswati Park in suburban Mumbai. Bored with his monotonous life, and stifled by his troublesome marriage, Mohan spends most of his time dreaming of becoming a writer. Meanwhile, Mohan's nephew, Ashish, a 19-year- old English literature student, moves in with them to complete his education after his parents are transferred to Indore. Ashish, struggling to accept his sexuality, is attracted to his classmate Sunder and later embarks on an affair with his much older tutor.

Anna Scott of The Guardian labelled the book \\"a meticulously written tale of hope and regret\\" and Sameer Rahim of The Telegraph wrote that Joseph's writing was \\"well crafted and the images, when they succeed, feel spot-on\\". Joseph was awarded the Betty Trask Prize in 2011. Also that year, the novel won the Desmond Elliott Prize; one of the judges, Edward Stourton, praised Joseph's \\"extraordinary maturity\\" and added that it was \\"hard to believe that it is a first novel\\". The novel also won the Vodafone Crossword Book Award for Fiction, sharing the trophy with Omair Ahmed's Jimmy The Terrorist, and was nominated for The Hindu Literary Prize.

Users may also upload up to 1,000 ebooks in the PDF or EPUB file formats. Google Play Books is available in 75 countries. Google Play Books was launched in December 2010, with a reseller program letting independent booksellers sell Google ebooks on their websites for a cut of sales. It also launched an affiliate program in June 2011, allowing website owners to earn a commission by referring sales to the then-named Google eBookstore. However, the reseller program ended in April 2012, with Google stating that it had \\"not gained the traction that we hoped it would\\" and \\"not met the needs of many readers or booksellers\\". The affiliate program closed for new signups in February 2012, with Google announcing that it would scale down the initiative, making it private and invitation-only. The mobile Android app has seen several significant updates since its introduction, including different reading modes with color contrasts, support for text highlighting and note-taking, a zoomed- out view with easy page sliding in an effort to improve reading experiences for books not read cover-to-cover, a vertical scrolling mode for comic books, a \\"Night Light\\" feature that gradually filters blue light to reduce eye strain after sunset, using machine learning imaging technologies to expand speech bubbles in comics, and listening to audiobooks. As the Play Books store had been noted to hold much pirated content, Google discontinued new sign-ups to its publisher program in 2015. The program was reopened only in 2018 when it incorporated an automated process to decline books found to contain extensive text copied from other books already in the store.  History  The history of Google Play Books can be traced to the Google eBooks service offered by Google before the Google Play brand came into existence. The Google eBookstore was launched on December 6, 2010, with more than three million titles available, making it the \\"largest ebooks collection in the world\\". At the time of launch, the service was partnered with 100 independent booksellers, while the number of publishers was 5,000. This increased to 250 independent booksellers and 7,000 publishers in May 2011, along with three million free Google eBooks available in the United States, up from two million at launch. The service was codenamed Google Editions, the name under which it was widely assumed that the service would be launched. Google Books director Dan Clancy had talked about Google's vision to open an ebookstore for in-print books in an interview back in July 2009. Then-named TechHive reported in October 2009 that the service would be launched in the first half of 2010, before a Google employee told the media in May that the launch would be in June or July. The actual launch, however, took place in December. The store was headed by Dan Clancy, who also directed Google Books. Clancy stated that Google Editions would let publishers set the prices for their books and would accept the 'agency' model, as that of the publisher being considered the seller with the online vendor acting as an 'agent'. Clancy also stressed that Google's ebooks would be readable on any device, indicating the open nature of the platform. It would also make ebooks available for bookstores to sell, giving \\"the vast majority\\" of revenues to the store. Having already digitized 12 million physical books at the time, including out-of-print titles, Google offered a \\"far greater\\" selection than Amazon and Apple did. In June 2011, Google introduced an affiliate program for ebooks, allowing websites to earn commissions by referring sales to the Google eBookstore. Google eBooks became listed on the Google Affiliate Network. In March 2012, Google revamped all of its digital distribution services into a single platform called Google Play, with the Google eBookstore becoming Google Play Books. In April 2012, Google announced that its reseller partner program would be discontinued by the end of January 2013. In July 2013, Google made some changes to the publisher policy page for Google Play Books, removing mentions of book bundle pricing, and adding several mentions of ebook rentals. Google also dropped support for a wide variety of ebook file formats it used to accept, including DOC, XML, HTML, MOBI and PDB, to focus primarily on the EPUB format. In early May 2015, Google announced that a new custom-made typeface called Literata would be used for Google Play Books. Towards the end of the month, Google announced that it was temporarily closing its Books Partner Center for new signups, stating that it was to \\"improve our content management capabilities and our user experience.\\" This was presumably in response to the observations of extensive piracy on the ebookstore reported by The Digital Reader. However, it continued to remain closed for a long time, leading The Digital Reader to speculate that the closure would be permanent, commenting that \\"Google has only a minimal interest in ebooks.\\" During this time, the only way authors and publishers could get their content on to the store was through aggregators, such as PublishDrive, ebookpartnership and StreetLib. In September 2015, Google acquired Oyster, a subscription-based ebook service. As a part of the acquisition, Oyster shut down its existing service in early 2016, and its founders joined Google Play Books in New York.Oyster shuts down, founders to lead Google Books New York. September 22, 2015 In January 2018, Google began selling audiobooks that can be listened via the app. In June 2018, Google reopened its publisher program to new sign-ups. To curb piracy, text of new books would now be compared with that of other books in the store. = Reseller program = At launch, Google had formed partnerships with independent booksellers, enabling them to sell Google ebooks on their websites for a cut of sales. Bookstore partners included Powell's, Alibris and participating members of the American Booksellers Association. In a blog post in May 2011, Google announced that it had over 250 independent bookseller partners, compared to just over 100 at the time of launch. In April 2012, Google decided to end the reseller program, stating that the program \\"has not gained the traction that we hoped it would\\" and that \\"it's clear that the reseller program has not met the needs of many readers or booksellers\\". The program was discontinued at the end of January 2013. As noted by Publishers Weekly, the service \\"sought to bring independent retailers into the digital retailing\\", by giving local bookstores a fee from each title purchased by consumers, but local stores were required to do their own marketing and promotion, something that \\"many stores simply did not have the resources to do\\". Seen as a \\"big blow for small bookstores seeking to compete against Amazon and Barnes & Noble\\", the move attracted severe criticism from the industry. In a letter to its members, the American Booksellers Association said that it was \\"very disappointed\\" in Google's decision while noting that the change could be \\"disconcerting and disruptive\\" for booksellers. \\"As an enormous, multinational corporation, Google has interests far beyond independent bookstores, and the book world at large, and, at times, it has lacked understanding of many basic principles of our industry\\", the letter said. = Affiliate program = In June 2011, Google launched an affiliate program for Google eBooks, allowing website owners to earn a commission by referring sales to the Google eBookstore. Google had previously tested the program as a limited beta in December 2010 with Goodreads. Becoming an affiliate was described by Gigaom as a three-step process: users first had to sign up for an AdSense account and be approved, then join the Google Affiliate Network and be approved, and then sign up as an affiliate for ebooks. Website owners could earn between 6-10% of a book's selling price, depending on the number of book sales through affiliate referrals. In February 2012, Google announced its decision to scale down the affiliate program, turning it into a private initiative and removing most of the affiliates. Google eBooks would no longer be listed as an advertiser on the Google Affiliate Network. Google had previously stopped accepting new applications for becoming an affiliate more than two weeks prior to the announcement. Those who were delinked from the program received commissions for sales up to March 15, 2012. Google said that it would continue to add affiliates, but only on an invitation-basis. In a mistake, Google also notified independent booksellers that their affiliate status would expire, but later clarified that it did not intend to remove independent booksellers from the affiliate program, and said that it was \\"working to reinstate those who were mistakenly notified.\\" = Piracy = In May 2015, The Digital Reader reported its findings of extensive piracy prevailing on the Play Books store. Website writer Nate Hoffelder noted that there were several e-book pirates selling non-authentic copies of e-books at reduced prices. They were of inferior quality, with \\"missing formatting, generic or outdated covers, and other problems\\". One day later, The Digital Reader reported that Google had removed the pirated book listings in response to the article, but deemed it far from enough.  Platforms  Books purchased can be read on a dedicated Books section of the Google Play website, through the mobile app available for Android and iOS devices, and through the use of a Google Chrome web browser app. Offline download and reading is supported on the mobile apps and through the Chrome web browser app. = Mobile app feature = Sample of the Literata typeface used for Google Play Books At launch, introductory features included customizations such as selecting a font, font size, line spacing, and day/night reading modes, and the ability to pick up reading positions while using multiple devices. On Android, the app's home screen shows recently opened books, as well as book recommendations and books +1'd by friends. The \\"My Library\\" section shows all the books grouped into three categories: \\"Purchases\\", \\"Samples\\" and \\"Uploads\\". Books can be \\"kept on device\\" for offline reading. Play Books features a 3D page turning effect, with an option to turn it off. It also allows users to turn pages using the device's volume controls. The website interface does not support different reading modes or any page turning effect. Text can be read out loud using the device's text-to-speech engine or Google Text-to-Speech, with an option for a \\"High-quality voice\\" in settings, although the feature requires a data connection to stream the voice data. In September 2012, Google Play Books on Android was updated to feature a new sepia reading mode, in addition to day and night modes; info cards for unknown written geographical locations and dictionary definitions; word or phrase translation; and support for highlighting text and writing notes. The sepia reading mode, text highlighting and note-taking features were eventually extended to the iOS app in August 2013. In May 2013, Play Books started allowing users to upload PDF and EPUB files for free through the Play Books website, with support for up to 1,000 files. The Android app was updated in December 2013 with support for uploading files. In October 2014, Play Books was updated to allow users to tap the center of the screen to enter a \\"skim\\" mode, where the page zooms out to allow users to easily slide between pages, in an effort to improve the reading experience for books that are typically not read cover-to-cover, such as non- fiction, cookbooks and textbooks. In November 2015, Play Books was updated with features aimed at comic book fans, with the update adding a new vertical scrolling experience for comics in landscape mode, and new curated pages and recommendations for comics, with options for organizing by issue and volume. In December 2015, Play Books was updated to include a \\"Night Light\\" feature that \\"gradually filters blue light from your screen, replacing it with a warm, amber light as the sun sets\\". Google claims that Night Light \\"automatically adapts to the amount of natural sunlight outside based on the time of day, giving you just the right temperature and brightness\\". In July 2016, Play Books was updated with \\"Bubble Zoom\\", a machine learning imaging feature that recognizes objects in comics and \\"expands the speech bubbles of a comic one- tap-at-a-time, making them super easy to read on your mobile device\\".  Books on Google Play  The Google Play store serves as the primary source of ebooks for reading on Google Play Books. , over five million titles are available. Select books, mainly textbooks, are available for rental. The rental period starts as soon as the payment is completed, not when the book is opened. Google Play also allows users to pre-order ebooks to have the title delivered automatically as soon as it's made available. = File formats = Originally, Google allowed publishers and authors to upload books in a number of formats, including DOC, PDF, PDB, MOBI, EPUB, and HTML. But in July 2013, support for all these formats except for PDF and EPUB were dropped. , Google accepts EPUB versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1. Both text and image-based PDFs are accepted when the EPUB format is not available, with the preference being for PDFs with a text layer. For reading on e-readers or third-party apps, some ebooks, but not all, can be downloaded in the EPUB (\\"flowing text\\") or PDF (\\"original pages\\") formats. Google states on its support pages that the advantage EPUB has over PDF is that it allows the book's text to adjust to different screen sizes, and offers smaller file sizes. Publishers have the option to enable digital rights management (DRM) protection for the digital file download of ebooks. The DRM system used is the Adobe Content Server 4. E-readers are required to support Adobe Digital Editions, and Google notes on its support pages that \\"Books bought on Google Play won't work on Amazon Kindle devices.\\" = Availability = Global availability of Google Play Books Purchase of books from Google Play is currently supported in 75 countries. The full country list includes: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, and Vietnam.  History of expansion  Google Play Books was launched Mexico in March 2013; Austria, Belgium, Ireland, and Portugal in June 2013; South Africa, Switzerland, and Turkey in November 2013; Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela in December 2013; Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan in November 2014; Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine in September 2014, and Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates in January 2016.  Reception  In a December 2010 review, Laura Miller of Salon wrote that the public domain titles on the Google eBookstore were of a \\"lesser quality\\" than on competing services, writing that some titles \\"had obviously not been proofed and the scans of the original pages were difficult to read\\". Despite that, Miller found it interesting that public domain titles had functionality to view them either as a \\"scanned version - with the original type, page numbering and even library stamps and marginalia, basically photographs of the printed pages\\" and also as \\"searchable \\"flowing text,\\" rendered by optical character recognition\\". Miller also wrote that the eBookstore was not easy to search, \\"an irony considering that the Google empire was built on search\\". She criticized the user interface for being \\"poor\\" and seemingly \\"devised by people who know next to nothing about the book trade\\". She praised Google's decision to incorporate reader reviews from Goodreads, writing that it \\"helps, as these are often more thoughtful than the average Amazon reader review\\", though again criticizing the \\"related books\\" section for bad suggestions. She also praised that Google had formed partnerships with independent bookstores, writing that it is \\"a great way to support neighborhood bookstores and it also allows Google eBookstore customers to partake of the expertise of people whose life's work is connecting readers with the right books.\\" In a May 2014 review, Riley Dennis of MakeUseOf wrote that \\"Google Play has been expanding its reach to all forms of media recently, and Play Books is one section that has noticeably improved and is now a genuine contender to the eReading competition\\". Dennis praised the ability to upload personal ebooks in addition to buying them, writing that it makes Play Books \\"a great universal eReader\\". Furthermore, he complimented the mobile Android app, writing that \\"Play Books is a delight to read on, from the refreshingly simple interface to the customizable and smooth reading experience\\", and that the page-turning animation was \\"delightful\\", \\"realistic\\" and \\"smooth\\". While writing about different forms of customization options available, he noted that \\"the margins can't be changed\\", and also criticized the website interface for lacking several features that were present in the mobile app. Dennis concluded his review by writing: \\"Play Books is a solid eReading app, but it still has room for growth.\\" References Play Books Android (operating system) software IOS software Play Books EPUB readers 2010 software E-book sources Books Textbook business Book rental ","title":"Google Play Books"},{"id":"42960976","text":"Dodecaibidion ornatipenne is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

On May 8, 2018, Google announced at Google I/O that Google Play Newsstand was being amalgamated with Google News. Launched in November 2013 through the merger of Google Play Magazines and Google Currents, the service let users subscribe to magazines (in select countries) and topical news feeds, receiving new issues and updates automatically. Content was offered for reading on a dedicated Newsstand section of the Google Play website or through the mobile apps for Android and iOS. Offline download and reading is supported on the mobile apps. For publishers, Google offers a variety of tools for customization and optimization of their content, as well as the option to include ads through the use of DoubleClick for Publishers. Publishers can restrict geographic access to their content, and employ Google Analytics for aggregated readership data. Publishers can also offer discounts for Google Play subscriptions if a user is already a subscriber on another platform, such as print or digital.  History  Google Play Newsstand was launched on Android on November 20, 2013, through the merger of Google Play Magazines and Google Currents into a single service. The Google Currents app on the iOS platform was redesigned and renamed to Google Play Newsstand on September 23, 2014. A web application for Newsstand was launched on November 16, 2016. The service has seen two major redesigns since its launch in 2013. The first, in October 2014, added elements from the \\"Material Design\\" design language for the release of Android Lollipop. The second, in November 2016, coincided with the launch of the website, and added machine learning technologies to better personalize the content to each individual user, including improved news recommendation, and expanded support for interactive, rich media. On May 15, 2018, Google Play Newsstand, along with Google News and Weather were replaced with Google News, although it wasn't until November 5 that it was phased out completely, removing the Newsstand tab from the Google Play website and the Play Store app. Then in January 2020, magazines were no longer available on Google News, ending all traces of Play Newsstand altogether, except for the website above, which still works even after discontinuation.  Features  Users can subscribe to digital magazines to receive new issues or access to content on an ongoing basis; but, since the replacement of Newsstand with News, users have posted hundreds of negative comments about the change - ranging from the failure to access paid for magazine subscriptions to felling as if they were being force fed topics which were not relevant to them.https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/news/UfO35TsUY90 Many there have been experiencing hundreds of derogatory comments posted by users on News . Subscriptions renew automatically, with the user charged at the start of each subscription period. Users are notified of price increases. Google states that existing subscribers of a print publication may be eligible for a free digital subscription.

Coloring game problems arose as game-theoretic versions of well-known graph coloring problems. In a coloring game, two players use a given set of colors to construct a coloring of a graph, following specific rules depending on the game we consider. One player tries to successfully complete the coloring of the graph, when the other one tries to prevent him from achieving it.  Vertex coloring game  The vertex coloring game was introduced in 1981 by Brams and rediscovered ten years after by Bodlaender. Its rules are as follows: # Alice and Bob color the vertices of a graph G with a set k of colors. # Alice and Bob take turns, coloring properly an uncolored vertex (in the standard version, Alice begins). # If a vertex v is impossible to color properly (for any color, v has a neighbor colored with it), then Bob wins. # If the graph is completely colored, then Alice wins. The game chromatic number of a graph G, denoted by \\\\chi_g(G), is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win the vertex coloring game on G. Trivially, for every graph G, we have \\\\chi(G) \\\\le \\\\chi_g(G) \\\\le \\\\Delta(G) + 1, where \\\\chi(G) is the chromatic number of G and \\\\Delta(G) its maximum degree.With less colors than the chromatic number, there is no proper coloring of G and so Alice cannot win. With more colors than the maximum degree, there is always an available color for coloring a vertex and so Alice cannot lose. =Relation with other notions= Acyclic coloring. Every graph G with acyclic chromatic number k has \\\\chi_g(G) \\\\le k(k+1). Marking game. For every graph G, \\\\chi_g(G) \\\\le col_g(G), where col_g(G) is the game coloring number of G. Almost every known upper bound for the game chromatic number of graphs are obtained from bounds on the game coloring number. Cycle-restrictions on edges. If every edge of a graph G belongs to at most c cycles, then \\\\chi_g(G) \\\\le 4+c. =Graph Classes= For a class {\\\\mathcal C} of graphs, we denote by \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal C}) the smallest integer k such that every graph G of {\\\\mathcal C} has \\\\chi_g(G) \\\\le k. In other words, \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal C}) is the exact upper bound for the game chromatic number of graphs in this class. This value is known for several standard graph classes, and bounded for some others: * Forests: \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal F}) = 4., and implied by Simple criteria are known to determine the game chromatic number of a forest without vertex of degree 3. It seems difficult to determine the game chromatic number of forests with vertices of degree 3, even for forests with maximum degree 3. * Cactuses: \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal C}) = 5., and implied by * Outerplanar graphs: 6 \\\\le \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal O}) \\\\le 7. * Planar graphs: 7 \\\\le \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal P}) \\\\le 17.Upper bound by , improving previous bounds of 33 in , 30 implied by , 19 in and 18 in . Lower bound claimed by . See a survey dedicated to the game chromatic number of planar graphs in . * Planar graphs of given girth: \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal P}_4) \\\\le 13, \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal P}_5) \\\\le 8, \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal P}_6) \\\\le 6, \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal P}_8) \\\\le 5. * Toroidal grids: \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal TG}) = 5. * Partial k-trees: \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal T}_k) \\\\le 3k+2. * Interval graphs: 2\\\\omega \\\\le \\\\chi_g({\\\\mathcal I}) \\\\le 3\\\\omega-2, where \\\\omega is for a graph the size of its largest clique. Cartesian products. The game chromatic number of the cartesian product G \\\\square H is not bounded by a function of \\\\chi_g(G) and \\\\chi_g(H). In particular, the game chromatic number of any complete bipartite graph K_{n,n} is equal to 3, but there is no upper bound for \\\\chi_g(K_{n,n} \\\\square K_{m,m}) for arbitrary n, m. * For a single edge we have: ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\chi_g(K_2 \\\\square P_k) &= \\\\begin{cases} 2 & k = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & k=2,3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 & k \\\\ge 4 \\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\chi_g(K_2 \\\\square C_k) &= 4 && k \\\\ge 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\chi_g(K_2 \\\\square K_k) &= k+1 \\\\end{align} * For stars we have: ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\chi_g(S_m \\\\square P_k) &= \\\\begin{cases} 2 & k = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & k=2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 & k \\\\ge 3 \\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\chi_g(S_m \\\\square C_k) &= 4 && k \\\\ge 3 \\\\end{align} * Trees: \\\\chi_g(T_1 \\\\square T_2) \\\\le 12. * Wheels: \\\\chi_g(P_2 \\\\square W_n) = 5 if n \\\\ge 9. * Complete bipartite graphs: \\\\chi_g(P_2 \\\\square K_{m,n}) = 5 if m, n \\\\ge 5. =Open problems= These questions are still open to this date.  Edge coloring game  The edge coloring game, introduced by Lam, Shiu and Zu, is similar to the vertex coloring game, except Alice and Bob construct a proper edge coloring instead of a proper vertex coloring. Its rules are as follows: # Alice and Bob are coloring the edges a graph G with a set k of colors. # Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly an uncolored edge (in the standard version, Alice begins). # If an edge e is impossible to color properly (for any color, e is adjacent to an edge colored with it), then Bob wins. # If the graph is completely edge-colored, then Alice wins. Although this game can be considered as a particular case of the vertex coloring game on line graphs, it is mainly considered in the scientific literature as a distinct game. The game chromatic index of a graph G, denoted by \\\\chi'_g(G), is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win this game on G. =General case= For every graph G, \\\\chi'(G) \\\\le \\\\chi'_g(G) \\\\le 2\\\\Delta(G) -1. There are graphs reaching these bounds but all the graphs we know reaching this upper bound have small maximum degree. There exists graphs with \\\\chi'_g(G) > 1.008\\\\Delta(G) for arbitrary large values of \\\\Delta(G). Conjecture. There is an \\\\epsilon > 0 such that, for any arbitrary graph G, we have \\\\chi'_g(G) \\\\le (2-\\\\epsilon)\\\\Delta(G). This conjecture is true when \\\\Delta(G) is large enough compared to the number of vertices in G. * Arboricity. Let a(G) be the arboricity of a graph G.

Incidence coloring game  The incidence coloring game is a graph coloring game, introduced by Andres,, see also erratum in and similar to the vertex coloring game, except Alice and Bob construct a proper incidence coloring instead of a proper vertex coloring. Its rules are as follows: # Alice and Bob are coloring the incidences of a graph G with a set k of colors. # Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly an uncolored incidence (in the standard version, Alice begins). # If an incidence i is impossible to color properly (for any color, i is adjacent to an incident colored with it), then Bob wins. # If all the incidences are properly colored, then Alice wins. The incidence game chromatic number of a graph G, denoted by i_g(G), is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win this game on G.

His research topics include migration, microenterprises, and methodology for use with developing country data. McKenzie is also a contributor to the World Bank's Development Impact blog and affiliated with the International Growth Centre and Innovations for Poverty Action.  Biography McKenzie received his B.A. (B.Com.) from the University of Auckland in New Zealand and his Ph.D. in economics from Yale University. He spent four years as an assistant professor at Stanford University before joining the World Bank. He is currently on the editorial boards of the Journal of Development Economics, World Bank Economic Review, Journal of Economic Perspectives, and Migration Studies. McKenzie also co-authored a write-up with Berk Ozler on the impact of economics blogs. His findings were discussed by Tyler Cowen on Marginal Revolution.  Research McKenzie's research focuses on migration, private sector development, and data methodology. According to IDEAS/RePEc, McKenzie belongs to the top 1% of economists in terms of research output.McKenzie ranked 284th out of 56171 researchers registered on IDEAS/RePEc. Retrieved June 24th, 2019. He frequently co-authors with Christopher Woodruff, John Gibson, Steven Stillman and Suresh de Mel.Personal page on Google Scholar. Retrieved June 24th, 2019. He has notably conducted research in Mexico, India and Sri Lanka. = Research on migration= One of the main fields of McKenzie's research is migration, with much of his research concentrating on migration between Mexico and the United States. A key theme of that research is that the impact of migration goes far beyond remittances and includes e.g. impacts on child health, the ability of others to migrate, community inequality, and incentives for education.McKenzie, D. (2006). Beyond remittances: The effects of migration on Mexican households. In: Schiff, M., Ozden, C. (eds.). International migration, remittances, and the brain drain. Washington, D.C.: World Bank, pp. 123-148. For instance, in work with Nicole Hildebrandt, McKenzie finds that migration improves child health by increasing rural Mexican households of emigrants both by raising their wealth and health knowledge.Hildebrandt, N., McKenzie, D.J. (2005). The effects of migration on child health in Mexico. Economia, 6(1), pp. 257-289. In another study with Hillel Rapoport in rural Mexico, McKenzie finds that migration depresses schooling attendance and attainment as boys emigrate and girls take up more household tasks.McKenzie, D., Rapoport, H. (2006). Can migration reduce educational attainment? Evidence from Mexico. Journal of Population Economics, 24(4), pp. 1331-1358. In further work, McKenzie and Rapoport have explored the role of migrant networks in Mexico, which are found to substantially decrease the costs for future migrants and overall reduce inequality across communities with high levels of past migration.McKenzie, D., Rapoport, H. (2007). Network effects and the dynamics of migration and inequality: theory and evidence from Mexico. Journal of Development Economics, 84(1), pp. 1-24. Moreover, McKenzie and Rapoport also observe that the presence of migrant networks drives self- selection, with Mexican communities with strong migrant networks \\"sending\\" typically less educated members to the US compared with communities with weaker networks, in line with Borjas (1987) and Chiquiar and Hanson (2005).McKenzie, D., Rapoport, H. (2010). Self-selection patterns in Mexico-US migration: the role of migration networks. Review of Economics and Statistics, 92(4), pp. 811-821. Another nexus of McKenzie's research on migration has been migration in the Pacific. In work with John Gibson, McKenzie notably found that the desire to maximize income cannot explain migration patterns among the very highly skilled, with many potential emigrants - especially those more risk averse, impatient or inept at foreign languages - deciding not to emigrate despite very high returns to migration, whereas many emigrants - especially those with strong ties to homebound family or who didn't emigrate for reasons of lifestyle - choose to return even though doing so implies forgoing large sums of income.Gibson, J., McKenzie, D. (2009). The microeconomic determinants of emigration and return migration of the best and brightest: Evidence from the Pacific. Journal of Development Economics, 95(1), pp. 18-29. In another study, McKenzie, Gibson and Steven Stillman analyze the effects of a Tongan migration lottery program to New Zealand, finding a negative impact of emigration on the resources of remaining household members, as remittances don't fully offset the shortfall in labour earnings; more generally, this suggests that comparisons of migrant and non-migrant households are likely to be biased due to self-selection of both households and household members into migration.Gibson, J., McKenzie, D., Stillman, S. (2011). The impacts of international migration on remaining household members: omnibus results from a migration lottery program. Review of Economics and Statistics, 93(4), pp. 1297-1318. By contrast, when studying the impact of New Zealand's seasonal worker programme on households in Tonga and Vanuatu, McKenzie and Gibson observe it to strongly improve those households' income, consumption, savings and standard of living.Gibson, J., McKenzie, D. (2014). The development impact of a best practice seasonal worker policy. Review of Economics and Statistics, 96(2), pp. 229-243. Most recently, in research with Rapoport, Albert Bollard and Melanie Morten, McKenzie has challenged concerns that educated migrants remit less, finding instead that - while results differ across destinations - more educated migrants remit on average more, with the effect within that group being mainly attributable to the higher income itself rather than to background characteristics.Bollard, A. et al. (2011). Remittances and the brain drain revisited: The microdata show that more educated migrants remit more. World Bank Economic Review, 25(1), pp. 132-156. Finally, in a popular article addressing questions around brain drain, McKenzie and Gibson highlight that brain drain has remained relatively stable over time, that skilled and unskilled migration are strongly correlated, that the likelihood of brain drain increases the lower domestic standards of living, security, political stability and opportunities for rewarding careers, and that examples of brain gain exist, among else.Gibson, J., McKenzie, D. (2011). Eight questions about brain drain. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 25(3), pp. 107-128. = Research on enterprises in developing countries= Another key area of McKenzie's research are (micro-)enterprises in developing countries and constraints to their growth. For instance, McKenzie and Christopher Woodruff find that start-up costs of Mexican microenterprises tend to be very low and returns to capital high, suggesting that entry costs are unlikely to provide an empirical basis for poverty traps.McKenzie, D.J., Woodruff, C. (2006). Do entry costs provide an empirical basis for poverty traps? Evidence from Mexican microenterprises. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 55(1), pp. 3-42. With regard to management practices, McKenzie, Nicholas Bloom, Aprajit Mahajan and John Roberts argue that the lack of good management practices (e.g. monitoring, target-setting or incentives) and owners' reluctance to delegate decision making to managers constrain the productivity growth of large firms in developing countries.Bloom, N. et al. (2010). Why do firms in developing countries have low productivity? American Economic Review, 100(2), pp. 619-623. In further research on Indian textile plants, McKenzie, Bloom, Mahajan, Roberts and Benn Eifert find these plants to often still rely on informal management practices because of a mix of lack of both information and competition, but that the adoption of better practices leads to large and sustained gains in productivity.Bloom, N. et al. (2013). Does management matter? Evidence from India. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 128(1), pp. 1-51. Much of McKenzie's research on microenterprises has been conducted with Suresh de Mel and Woodruff in Sri Lanka. In one study, after randomly assigning cash grants to microentrepreneurs, they find annual real returns to capital of 55-63% per year, i.e., much higher than prevailing market interest rates, with the returns varying by entrepreneurial ability and household wealth, but not by risk aversion, suggesting that insufficient access to credit might not be a key constraint.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2008). Returns to Capital in Microenterprises: Evidence from a Field Experiment. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 123(4), pp. 1329-1372. Faced with the difficulty of measuring profits, they find that simply asking firms about their profits offers a more accurate measure than detailed questions on revenues and expenses, as firms tend to underreport a nearly a third of their revenues, and that while providing entrepreneurs with account diaries helps address that issue, it doesn't significantly change reported profits.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D.J., Woodruff, C. (2009). Measuring microenterprise profits: Must we ask how the sausage is made? Journal of Development Economics, 88(1), pp. 19-31. Moreover, the positive returns to capital are found to be completely concentrated among enterprises owned by men, a fact that cannot be explained by differences in the entrepreneurs' characteristics, but rather suggests that capital given to female entrepreneurs is more likely to be consumed or misinvested by other household members.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2009). Are women more credit constrained? Experimental evidence on gender and microenterprise returns. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 1(3), pp. 1-32. In further work on this issue, they randomly offer both existing and potential female microentrepreneurs either the ILO's Start- and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) programme or a combination of SIYB training and a cash grant, then finding that the training only has an impact on business profitability for new entrepreneurs and that the impact of the combined support dissipates in the second year.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2014). Business training and female enterprise start-up, growth, and dynamics: Experimental evidence from Sri Lanka. Journal of Development Economics, 106, pp. 199-210. In a comprehensive review of research on business trainings in developing countries, McKenzie and Woodruff conclude that business trainings generally have only modest impacts on existing firms, partly because firm owners' application of the taught practices is often limited, though trainings seem to help prospective entrepreneurs launch start- ups faster and better.McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2013). What are we learning from business training and entrepreneurship evaluations around the developing world? World Bank Research Observer, 29(1), pp. 48-82. Together with Woodruff and de Mel, McKenzie has argued most microentrepreneurs (\\"own account workers\\") are more akin to wage workers than larger firm owners, suggesting that most of them - unlike e.g. Hernando de Soto's argument - are merely waiting for wage work and unlikely to become employers.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C.M. (2010). Who are the microenterprise owners? Evidence from Sri Lanka on Tokman v. de Soto. In: Lerner, J., Schoar, A. (eds). International Differences in Entrepreneurship. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 63-87. Another key finding related to Sri Lankan firms is that providing informal enterprises with payments equivalent to two months of the profits of the median firm leads to registration of half of the firms, whereas the mere provision of information about the registration process and possibility of getting reimbursed for registration costs has no impact; land ownership issues are raised as the most common reason for not registering.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2013). The demand for, and consequences of, formalization among informal firms in Sri Lanka. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 5(2), pp. 122-150. Finally, more recently, when comparing the impact of cash and in-kind grants on the profitability of microenterprises in urban Ghana, McKenzie, Woodruff, Marcel Fafchamps, and Simon Quinn found a flypaper effect whereby - unlike cash - capital coming directly into the business \\"sticks\\" there, though neither type of grants has an impact on enterprise profitability when provided to female subsistence entrepreneurs.Fafchamps, M. et al. (2014). Microenterprise growth and the flypaper effect: Evidence from a randomized experiment in Ghana.

The unit was organized as a home guard composed of volunteers who were trained and organized as parallel to the state‚Äôs National Guard. As a part of Pennsylvania's official militia, the Pennsylvania State Guard was trained, organized, and funded by the state of Pennsylvania, answered to the governor, and could not be federalized or deployed abroad. History of predecessor units Both the National Guard of the United States and state defense forces trace their roots to the state militias which made up the majority of the military forces of the United States before the Militia Act of 1903 went into effect, creating the modern National Guard system. Prior to this act, the United States maintained a small, full-time military which would be supplemented by state volunteer units during war. During the American Revolutionary War, Pennsylvania produced various militia units in support of the Patriot cause. In the American Civil War, Pennsylvania supplied multiple units in support of the Union cause. In the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, eighteen regiments, as well as several cavalry, artillery, and engineering units, and the Pennsylvania Naval Militia were raised in Pennsylvania to fight in the war. The Pennsylvania Reserve Militia was organized as a home guard during World War I. World War II During World War II, the entire National Guard was federalized, leaving individual states vulnerable to invasion, insurrection, natural disasters, rioting, and other emergencies which could no longer be handled by the National Guard. As a result, State Guard Act signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on October 21, 1940, giving individual states the option to create and maintain their own military forces independent of the federal government. The Pennsylvania Reserve Defense Corps was created by executive order of Governor Arthur B. James on March 19, 1941. The Pennsylvania Reserve Defense Corps was organized based on U.S. Army standards, with units being organized along standard military unit sizes and drilling part-time, generally one night a week and during one full week per year. On May 3, 1943, the name was changed by an Act of Assembly to the Pennsylvania State Guard. The unit would serve in a homeland security role for the duration of the war. =Membership= The draft left few men available for stateside military service; men waiting to be drafted and men too old or otherwise unfit for federal duty made up the potential recruiting pool, so age standards were relaxed considerably. Membership was open to individuals aged 21 to 50, with no upper age limit for officers. =Organization= Initially, the unit was organized as a single brigade, divided into three regiments, with each regiment containing three battalions, each battalion containing three companies, and each company containing two platoons of roughly thirty men each, with a total of 1,934 men making up the brigade upon creation of the force. At its peak, the force would grow to include 5,700 men organized into various units, including the following units: * 1st Regiment * 2nd Regiment * 4th Regiment * 10th Regiment * 16th Regiment * 1st Cavalry Squadron  C Troop, 1st Cavalry Squadron (separate mechanized cavalry unit) * 1st Engineer Battalion. =Equipment= Weapons provided by the state included the M1903 Springfield rifle and the M50 Reising submachine gun, although officers were expected to provide their own sidearms. Private organizations also contributed equipment to units. Non-lethal supplies, including woolen socks and gloves, were donated by Chapter 44 of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish service organization, and mattresses and sheets for the Regimental Medical Detachment were donated by Liberty Chapter No. 22, Disabled American War Veterans. =Duties= As a state defense force, the Pennsylvania State Guard was responsible for the stateside duties of the National Guard. This could include potentially repelling an invasion, quelling a riot, or responding to a natural disaster. For the duration of the war, responsibilities were divided among the units of the Guard based on their geographical location. The First Regiment was responsible for guarding the bridges near the eastern Pennsylvania cities and towns of Phillipsburg, Washington Park, Lambertville, Yardley, Trenton, Norristown, Reading and Columbia. The 2nd Regiment (minus E Company) was responsible for guarding the bridges near the central Pennsylvania cities and towns of Sunbury, Northumberland, Williamsport, Jersey Shore, Muncy, Berwick, Plymouth, Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, Falls, Oil City, Tionesta, Franklin and Elmerton. The 3rd Regiment was responsible for guarding the bridges near the western Pennsylvania cities or towns of Warren, Parker, East Brady, Freeport and New Kensington, and in coordination with local authorities concerning the bridges at Pittsburgh, Saltsburg, Blairsville, Ambridge, Sewickley, Elizabeth, Monongahela, Donora, Monessen, Brownsville, and Masontown. The Brigade Headquarters Company was responsible for the 24-hour safety of the state airport at Marsh Run and 24-hour roving patrol of the bridges spanning the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg. E Company of the 2nd Regiment was responsible for covering the Clarks Ferry Bridge and the Juniata crossing and maintaining night security on the State Arsenal at Harrisburg. Korean War Following the federalization of the 28th Infantry Division of the Pennsylvania National Guard, the State Guard was reorganized. It closely emulated its World War II model, with the main differences being that during the Korean War the Guard was organized as a division instead of a brigade, and that regimental commanders were required to be military veterans who had seen combat overseas, and company grade officers were required to have served in the military overseas. Disbandment Following the cessation of hostilities at the end of the Korean War, the State Guard was disbanded. Legal status State defense forces are permitted by the federal government under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. Pennsylvania law also recognizes the authority of the Governor of Pennsylvania to create and maintain a state defense force. Currently, 23 states and the territory of Puerto Rico take advantage of this legislation by maintaining active state defense forces. Therefore, the state of Pennsylvania could reestablish a state defense force either through a legislative act or an executive order.

Honours In October 1999, Gus John was asked by Tony Blair to accept a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the New Year Honours List, 2000. Declining, John said that he believed such honours to be anachronistic and indeed an insult to the struggles of African people like himself who have spent their life trying to humanise British society and combating racism, which is a core part of the legacy of Empire and which the society and its institutions are perennially failing to confront. He was quoted by The Guardian as saying:Michael White, \\"How the Empire gong could be dumped in the dustbin of history\\" (interview by Patrick Barkham), The Guardian, 14 July 2004. The journalist Jon Snow, who himself refused an OBE, made a special study of the honours system, writing in The Independent: \\"Gus John, the Afro-Caribbean former Director of Education for Hackney, explained to me what it felt like for him to be approached with the offer of being appointed CBE. 'I regard [the title] Commander of the British Empire as part of the iconography of British imperialism,' he said.\\"Jon Snow, \\"Medals that lost their lustre\\", The Independent, 28 December 2003. Snow subsequently commented to a Parliamentary Select Committee investigating criticism of the honours system on John's position: \\"As he had fought his whole life trying to unpick the consequences of British imperialism, he felt it was a pretty serious dishonour to have to wander round the planet henceforth as a Commander of the very institution he had tried to demolish.\\"Quoted in Select Committee on Public Administration Fifth Report, Parliament, 13 July 2004.

Evolution of electric vehicles Electric Rickshaws in Lumbini, Nepal Qufu - Gogobike - P1060306 The electric automobile did not easily develop into a viable means of transportation. Research waned from 1920 to 1960 until environmental issues of pollution and diminishing natural resources reawakened the need of a more environmentally friendly means of transportation. Technologies that support a reliable battery and the weight of the needed number of batteries elevated the price of making an electric vehicle.Whitener, Barbara. The Electric Car Book. Louisville, KY: Love Street Books, 1981. In 1837, Robert Davidson of Scotland appears to have been the builder of the first electric car, but it wasn't until the 1890s that electric cars were manufactured and sold in Europe and America. During the late 1890s, United States roads were populated by more electric automobiles than those with internal combustion engines.Shacket, Sheldon R. The Complete Book of Electric Vehicles. Northbrook, IL: Domus Books, 1979.  Development of E-Rickshaw market in India  Share of E-Rickshaw Production in India till FY 2018 = Share of E-Rickshaw Production in India = E-Rickshaw's have now transitioned from being a market entrant in the automobile segment of the country to evolve as a leading short distance transport solution. This segment has gained spurt in last three years and the growth has been phenomenal. Although, this segment is dominated by a host of unorganized players the established names have also identified the growth beacon and are expected to foray into the segment. The share of production for e-rickshaws for now is indicated. Sales of E-Rickshaw in India from 2015-16 to 2017-18 = Sales of E-Rickshaw Trends in India = E-Rickshaw has gained market base post 2015 in an established way. Though introduction in India did happen on the lines of China in the late 2010s but was very sporadic and was not spread across. It was the drive to have greener transport industry especially in tier-2 & tier-3 cities the e-rickshaw market is vastly gaining base and is likely to grip on further in coming years with the advent of established players in the segment as well. The actual sales value for e-rickshaws in India is depicted in Exhibit. Design and construction Customized electric rickshaws in Comilla, Bangladesh These rickshaws have a M.S(Mild Steel) tubular Chassis, consisting of three wheels with a differential mechanism at the rear wheels. The motor is brushless DC motor manufactured mostly in India and China. The electrical system used in Indian version is 48V and Bangladesh is 60V. The body design from most popular Chinese version is of very thin iron or aluminum sheets. Vehicles made in fiber are also popular because of their strength and durability, resulting in low maintenance, especially in India. Body design is varied from load carriers, passenger vehicles with no roof, to full body with windshield for drivers comfort. It consist of a controller unit.They are sold on the basis of voltage supplied and current output, also the number of mosfet (metal oxide field effect transistors) used. The battery used is mostly lead acid battery with life of 6‚Äì12 months. Deep cycle batteries designed for electric vehicles are rarely used. Weight of the electric car has also been a recurring design difficulty in them. Types Binondo District, Manila, Philippines =Load carriers= These are load carrying versions of these rickshaws differ in their upper body, load carrying capacity, motor power, controller and other structural aspects, sometimes motor power is also increased in order to carry loads up to 500‚Äì1000 kg. =Solar= There are two types of solar vehicles: * Directly solar-powered - fitted with solar panels. A directly solar-powered rickshaw is an electric auto rickshaw driven solely by one or more electric motors, powered by solar panels mounted on the vehicle and capable of operating while the vehicle is in motion. Theoretically, solar panels could provide power directly to the motor(s) without the need for batteries, but in reality this would be an improbable design choice for a rickshaw, given its intended purpose. In e-rickshaws, however solar panels are not effective and are not frequently used. In practice, the term solar rickshaw is most commonly used to describe battery-electric rickshaws whose batteries are indirectly solar-charged (i.e. independently from the vehicle) prior to use. This is usually facilitated by removing batteries in need of charging from the vehicle, and exchanging them for batteries which have already been charged. Alternatively, batteries can be charged in-situ while the vehicle is parked, although this may limit daytime usage. The exact same battery replacement and in-situ methods are of course also used for non-'solar' batteries and vehicles. Popularity Electric rickshaw are most popular in Asia. The low cost Chinese version being the first to show up on streets. They are mostly used in China, India, Bangladesh and Nepal, also in low numbers other parts of Asia they have been showing up. China, Japan, India, and European countries (Switzerland, France, Germany) have researched and developed electric tricycles for commercial transport and are attempting to capture the growing market in Asia. Government has made efforts though to run them and made plans to issue licences on a fee of 1.5tk but there has been no action on this matter to date. =Bangladesh= Bangladesh imports electric rickshaws directly from China or via other countries, the well established cities prefer them as cheaper and better means of transport. The government in an inter- ministerial meeting on 5 May banned import and assembly of the vehicles and decided to send off-road those already plying, primarily on the ground that it consumes electricity mostly through illegal connections. =China= An electric rickshaw in Haikou, Hainan, China China is the largest manufacturer of electric rickshaws in the world, due to low labor cost, high production rates and encouraging government policies on foreign trade they import a large number on daily basis. There are hundreds of electric rickshaw manufacturers and thousands of parts producers. Their main market is within small towns or cities with insufficient public transport. =India= One of the first attempt to design electric rickshaws was done by Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute in late 1990s. . In India, these so-called e-rickshaws are widely spread all over the country, starting to gain popularity around 2011. The design is now much different from cycle rickshaws. Today, e-rickshaws play a vital role in providing livelihood to people in India. Due to their low cost and high efficiency they are accepted on the Indian streets, but government policies have been threatening the e-rickshaw and banned its use in the capital city Delhi, but failed to put them off the streets. E-rickshaws are still rising in number and widely used in Delhi and other parts of India. In Delhi, as per government official's figures in April 2012, their number was over 100,000. Manufacturers often market their product as an Indian make, even though almost all vehicles are assembled from parts that were imported from China. This is due to the drastically lower cost of Chinese components, especially batteries and electronics. A downside of electric rickshaws in India is the predominant use of cheap batteries with low durability. As there is not the necessary recycling infrastructure in many parts of the country, the toxic chemicals in lead batteries lead to a waste problem. E-rickshaw law in India Initially e-rickshaws were unregulated by any central law in India. However, the Delhi High Court, banned running of e-rickshaws in Delhi on 31 July 2014, over safety concerns raised through a public interest litigation. In a rally held for regularization of e rickshaws in Delhi transport minister Nitin Gadkari said that \\"municipal corporations would regularize e-rickshaws by registering them for a fee of just ‚Çπ100. After registering the e-rickshaw, corporations will have to issue identity cards to drivers so they can earn their livelihood easily.\\" Once the policy was in place, the corporation, along with traffic police, would have fix the amount of fine to be imposed for violation of the policy. However, the policy was never implemented. Certain states like Tripura had regularised the e-rickshaws through municipal bylaws or through state legislation. In March 2015, the Indian Parliament passed an amendment to the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2015 legalizing e-rickshaws. By July 2015, battery rickshaws are available for travel in many cities, now certified to ply with Registration No. plate by R.T.O. with insurance. ReferencesShacket, Sheldon R.

Pope's music has been featured nationwide on Sirius XM radio. He has toured nationally alongside acts such as John Michael Montgomery, Mark Chesnutt, Shooter Jennings, David Allan Coe, John Schneider (screen actor), and Sunny Sweeney. In 2019, his hit song, \\"Stoned On The One\\" was recorded by John Schneider (screen actor) and signifies one of Schneider's fastest rising hits to date, peaking at #30 on Music Row‚Äôs Country Breakout Chart.  Early life  Andrew Pope was born on January 21, 1985 at Dekalb Regional Medical Center in Fort Payne, Alabama. He is a native of Geraldine, Alabama, United States and he attended Geraldine High School. At a very early age, Pope was introduced to music. When he was with his mother and step- father, Pope would hear artists like Hank Williams Jr, Merle Haggard, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Through attending a small church with his grandmother, he was exposed to southern gospel hymns and when he was with his grandfather he would hear folks like Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, and Fats Domino. Pope would begin piano lessons at the age of 6. It wasn't long after that until Andrew's family realized he was a natural born musician. Pope, however, would not go on to pursue this until later in life. Pope was a rather shy child and other than playing the occasional \\"Sunday special\\" at his church, he did not want to perform in public. He would practice the piano day in and day out, by himself, and eventually he would create his own arrangements by listening to the notes. At age 14, Andrew's mother borrowed an old guitar from a cousin and placed it in Andrew's bedroom. When Pope got home from school he noticed the guitar and, never having played one before, he picked it up and began to find a few basic chords, by ear. This would lead to Pope's new obsession. He would play this guitar every day until he got his very own for Christmas later that year. The first song Pope learned to play was \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. He had not yet figured out all of the chords for the song, but he learned to mimic the lead guitar parts, originally created/played by Lynyrd Skynyrd's Gary Rossington. Pope would not give up until he learned what would become the very first song he taught himself to strum, one of his favorites, Alabama's \\"My Home's in Alabama\\". Pope wrote his first song at the age of 20, while going through a divorce. This would open the portal to his highly praised songwriting talents that many boast about today. Pope would then go on to graduate from Gadsden State Community College with honors, receiving an Associate degree in Business administration.  Music career  Andrew Pope started performing at honky tonk bars in January 2008, alongside friend Tyler Cooper. The duo would eventually become known as \\"The Midnight Rounders\\", touring the Southeast region with over 100 dates per year, often playing only for tips. In 2010, Pope formed the band, Andrew Pope & Bootleg Whiskey. They toured heavily, mainly around the Southeast region, performing over 120 shows per year. The original lineup for Andrew Pope & Bootleg Whiskey consisted of: Andrew Pope - Vocals, Guitar, Keys, Harmonica Josh Pope - Keys, Guitar, Lead Guitar Keegan Walsh - Bass Guitar Scott Paulson - Drums, BGVs Ray Gressett (Replaced Josh Pope in 2011) - Lead Guitar In 2012, Pope was discovered by MillTown Records and later signed an independent deal that would bring forth his debut album, \\"Here We Go\\" in November 2012. The album featured songs written by Pope as well as guest appearances from Confederate Railroad and Jeff Cook from country supergroup Alabama. \\"Here We Go\\" debuted at number 63 on the ITunes Country Album chart. After touring in support of the album, Pope began to immerse himself in his writing. From 2013 to 2016, Pope would go on to write some 300 songs. Frequent co-writers at the time included world class songwriters such as Mark Narmore, Larry Bastian, and Country Music Hall of Famer Bobby Bare. In 2017, Pope would produce and release his second album, \\"Stoned On The One\\", under self owned music label Alacob Music. All songs featured on the album are written or co-written by Pope. It features guest appearances/contributions from folks such as The Bellamy Brothers, James Otto, and Larry Gatlin. \\"Stoned On The One\\" debuted at number 49 on iTunes Top Country Albums chart to high praise. Songs from the album are featured heavily in rotation on Shooter Jennings‚Äô longtime running program, Shooter Jennings‚Äô Electric Rodeo on Sirius XM Outlaw Country. In a 2017 Billboard article, Shooter Jennings would proclaim Andrew to \\"have a bright future in country music'. In 2019, actor/singer/songwriter John Schneider (screen actor) recorded Pope‚Äôs \\"Stoned On The One\\" for his album \\"Redneck Rebel\\". \\"Stoned On The One\\" has proved to be one of Schneider's fastest rising most successful songs to date, currently charting at number 39 on Music Row's Country Breakout Chart. On August 17, 2019, Schneider would invite Andrew as a guest to the Grand Ole Opry for the debut of Stoned On The One live. His performance was received to a standing ovation from the sell out crowd. Schneider says, \\"This is one of the best country songs I have ever heard and I am so lucky to be able to know and get to hang out with this man, Andrew Pope\\". In 2020, Schneider recorded two additional songs written by Pope, \\"Comin' To\\" and \\"Haulin' Hell and Bayou Bound.\\" The songs will be featured in Schneider's newest film \\"Stand On It\\", a tribute to Smokey and the Bandit. The songs will also be included on Schneider's newest album and soundtrack for the film. Currently, Pope plans to release new music in the near future with friend/producer Shooter Jennings.

Lumsden and C√©sar Pelli. Construction was completed in 1969. It is made up of two buildings: a seventeen-story office tower, and a ten-story hospital. The plaza originally housed Century City Hospital, which was owned by Tenet Healthcare Corporation. Tenet closed the hospital in 2004 as it sold it to Salus Surgical Group. The hospital was renamed as Century City Doctors Hospital, which closed in 2008 after filing for bankruptcy.

His most important work is the Wujing Zhengyi (\\"Correct Meaning of the Five Classics\\"), which became the standard curriculum for the Imperial Examinations, and the basis for all future official commentaries of the Five Classics. He was also \\"skilled at mathematics and the calendar.\\" Early life Kong Yingda was born 574 in Hengshui, Jizhou (), in the state of Northern Qi of the Northern Dynasties. He was said to be a 32nd-generation descendant of Confucius, and his father Kong An (), grandfather Kong Shuo (), and great-grandfather Kong Linggui () all served as high-ranking government officials. Kong began studying Confucian classics in childhood. He later became a pupil of Liu Zhuo (ÂäâÁÑØ), a renowned scholar of the time, and studied the Shangshu and Du Yu's annotations of the Zuo Zhuan under his guidance. Sui dynasty After Emperor Yang ascended the throne of the Sui dynasty in 604, the emperor invited famous scholars and their students to his court, including Liu Zhuo and Kong Yingda. Kong excelled in scholarly debates, and was appointed to a high post at the age of only 30. His eminence caused envy in some established scholars, who were ashamed of being inferior to him and made an abortive attempt to have him assassinated. Tang dynasty After the Tang dynasty replaced the short-lived Sui, Kong Yingda became one of the \\"Eighteen Scholars\\" in the court of Emperor Taizong of Tang, along with the likes of Du Ruhui and Fang Xuanling. He served in several top positions of the Imperial Academy, and participated in the composition of the Book of Sui, the official history of the Sui dynasty. The emperor awarded him the nobility rank of viscount. To reconcile the conflicting versions and traditions of the Confucian classics, in 637, Emperor Taizong sponsored a project to create a standardized compilation and interpretation of the texts. Kong Yingda was appointed the head of the project, and he gathered a team of experts including Yan Shigu, Sima Caizhang (), Wang Gong (), and Wang Yan (), who spent five years to finish the project, and Emperor Taizong personally named the work Wujing Zhengyi (‰∫îÁ∂ìÊ≠£Áæ©, \\"Correct Meaning of the Five Classics\\"). However, their work was criticized for verbosity by other scholars including Ma Jiayun (), and the emperor ordered further revisions to be made. Kong Yingda died before the revision was completed, and Zhangsun Wuji was appointed to finish the work, which was finally approved in 653 by the next emperor, Gaozong. Kong Yingda died in 648, at the age of 74. He was given the honour to be buried in the Zhao Mausoleum, accompanying Emperor Taizong in death. Legacy Kong Yingda's Wujing Zhengyi became the canonical interpretation of the Confucian classics, and the standard curriculum for the Imperial Examinations. He coined the Chinese word for curriculum, kecheng, in a commentary to the Classic of Poetry. Wujing Zhengyi was also the basis for all future official commentaries on the Five Classics. As such, Kong Yingda is recognized as one of the most influential Confucian scholars in history.

The bridge is located upstream of the city center and connects Belgrade neighbourhoods of Zemun and Borƒça. It is part of Semi-Inner Ring circle. Opened in December 2014, it became the second bridge over the Danube in Belgrade, after the Panƒçevo Bridge in 1946.  Name  Due to the origin of the investors, even before the construction began, the bridge was colloquially called \\"Chinese Bridge\\" (, ). During the construction, its tentative name was Zemun‚ÄìBorƒça bridge, but later it got named after Serbian scientist and inventor Mihajlo Pupin. The name Chinese Bridge, however, continued to linger in an informal usage. It was decided to call it after Pupin as the bridge connects the Banat region, a birth region of the scientists, with Belgrade. As it was decided to name the bridge after Pupin a bit prior to its opening, the Chinese partners decided to mark the occasion placing a marble slab which would commemorate the date of the ceremonial opening. However, this caused a minor scandal. Apart from the bad Serbian grammar, the memorial was carved in the black marble rectangle slab, which, unknown to the Chinese, is a traditional Serbian gravestone. After public protests, \\"the bridge's headstone\\" was replaced.  History  The need for a bridge at this location was apparent for decades prior to its construction. However, the bad economic state and constant need for repairs on the bridges across the other Belgrade river, the Sava, postponed the project. First concrete steps were made in 2009 when city administration gave preliminary details about the project. The decision was made that the bridge will be built from the Chinese credits and that Chinese firms will build it, with Serbian companies as the sub- contractors. In the late 2009 a precontract was signed with the Chinese partners. It stipulated the beginning of the construction in the mid-2010 and the deadline set for the finish was 2013. But the deadlines were postponed in the next year and a half, citing various reasons (lack of seriousness of the Chinese investor, unacceptable requests for advance payments, numerous other Chinese requests, etc.) First workers and the equipment arrived from China only in the mid-2011, and at this moment it was clear that the bridge will not be finished before the spring of 2014. The works were also delayed because of the legal problems with a group of families who lived in the Pregrevica neighborhood of Zemun, where the bridge was to cross on the Zemun's bank. The bridge construction costs of ‚Ç¨170 million were provided by the Exim Bank of China (85%) and the Government of Serbia and the City of Belgrade (15%). The Chinese-built bridge was also China's first big infrastructure investment on the European continent. The total cost of the bridge and the access roads in the end reached ‚Ç¨260 million.  Construction  The works began in earnest in the fall of 2011. The inhabitants from Pregrevica were resettled to the neighborhood of Bele Vode, in the municipality of ƒåukarica, in the late 2011 and early 2012. In January 2012, famed film actor Bata ≈Ωivojinoviƒá visited the workers to wish them happy Chinese New Year, as his 1972 film Walter Defends Sarajevo is one of the most popular war movies in China while ≈Ωivojinoviƒá himself was one of the most popular foreign actors in China. In July 2014, the two sides of the bridge were connected and the works continued up to the fall of that year. The bridge was opened by Premier of the People's Republic of China Li Keqiang on 18 December 2014.  Characteristics  The bridge and of new access roads will help to divert heavy traffic from Belgrade city centre. The bridge is designed as two independent bridge structures of three car lanes wide and pedestrian-bicycle paths on both sides.

It is a small fish with a yellowish- brown dorsal surface separated by a dark stripe from its silvery flanks and underside. Description The yellowback puller grows to a maximum length of about . The single dorsal fin has thirteen spines and eleven to thirteen soft rays and the anal fin has two spines and ten or eleven soft rays. This fish has a dark diagonal line running from the eye to the posterior end of the dorsal fin. Above this line it is yellowish-brown and below it is silvery. The upper and lower edges of the deeply forked tail fin are black. Distribution and habitat The yellowback puller is native to the subtropical east coast of Australia. Its range extends from northern Queensland to southern New South Wales and includes Lord Howe Island. It is found at depths between on the outer side of coral-rich rocky reefs and in estuaries. Young fish sometimes inhabit lagoons, as do some adults. Biology The yellowback puller is a shoaling species and often found in association with the black-axil chromis (Chromis atripectoralis). It feeds on algae, zooplankton and small invertebrates. It forms pairs in the breeding season. The eggs are adhesive and stick to the seabed where the male guards them and keeps them aerated. The yellowback puller is sometimes parasitised by the isopod crustacean Anilocra pomacentri. The size of the parasite and the fish seems to be correlated indicating that the manca (juvenile isopod) attaches at an early stage in the life of the fish and that both grow simultaneously. In the aquarium The yellowback puller is suitable to be kept in a reef aquarium where it can be fed on brine shrimps and mysid shrimps. Being a shoaling fish, it should be kept in a small group, and being non-aggressive, it mixes well with other species of fish.

Stage The first professional stage adaptation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, the musical Alice in Wonderland, a Dream Play for Children, in two acts, debuted on 23 December 1886 at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London, England, and continued until 18 March 1887, to good reviews; it starred Phoebe Carlo as Alice. The musical was later revived and performed at the Globe Theatre from 26 December 1888 to 9 February 1889, with Carroll's friend, Isa Bowman, as Alice. The musical was frequently revived during the \\"Christmas season,\\" being produced eighteen times from 1898 to 1930. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has since been adapted for various forms of the stage, including \\"ballets, operas, experimental theatre, Broadway musicals, puppet plays, mime acts, and rock musicals.\\" Film Directed and produced by Cecil Hepworth, the first film adaptation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland debuted in Great Britain in 1903 as a silent film and in January 1904 in the United States. Because of its nature as a silent film, \\"it circulated freely throughout Europe and America.\\" It starred May Clark as Alice and Hepworth's wife as the Queen of Hearts. The British Film Institute has restored fourteen of the original sixteen scenes. Two more silent film adaptations of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland were produced: one in 1910 starring Gladys Hulette, and another in 1915 with Viola Savory as Alice. Ruth Gilbert starred as Alice in the first Alice film with sound (1931), followed by Charlotte Henry (1933), Carol Marsh (1948), Anne- Marie Malik (1966) and Fiona Fullerton (1972).

This version was based on Through the Looking Glass therefore Alice returning to Wonderland at the age of 19. Disney See also Alice in Wonderland (Disney franchise). =Animated film= Alice is the main character of Alice in Wonderland. Alice is portrayed as being very curious, often seen daydreaming and giving herself advice instead of listening to the advice of others. The closest thing Alice has to a friend is Dinah, her kitten, and not even she understands Alice's dreams of finding \\"a world of her own.\\" Alice is well mannered, polite, courteous, mature and has an elegance and gentleness of a young woman, although once she falls into Wonderland she finds it harder and harder to maintain her composure. She is shown to be determined, but her determination is often overpowered by her temper, seeing as she does not give up on finding the White Rabbit until she gets frustrated, and is easily put off by rudeness. She wears a blue puffy short-sleeved knee-length wide-skirted dress, a white pinafore apron over-top and a black ribbon tied into a bow in her thick blonde shoulder-length hair on top of her head. Underneath her dress she wore frilly white ruffled knee-length bloomers over matching thigh-high stockings, a matching petticoat and black strapped Mary Jane shoes. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland had served as inspiration for Walt Disney's earlier Alice Comedies. By 1931, he had \\"storyboards and sketches\\" for a film adaptation of the children's novel; however, the release of another Alice film during the same year caused him to put the project on hold. With the conclusion of World War II, Disney considered the film again, planning it to be a combination of live- action and animation starring Ginger Rogers as Alice. In 1946, however, Disney decided to drop the live-action aspect of his Alice film and make it completely animated instead. For the voice of Alice, he wanted one \\"that would be English enough to satisfy British audiences and preserve the feeling of an English literary classic, but not so English that it would put off American audiences.\\" He found that in young actress Kathryn Beaumont, when watching her in On an Island with You. Successfully auditioning for the role of Alice, Beaumont voiced the character and acted as reference material for the animators: her acting was recorded and used by them to animate the character. During the recording of her voice acting, Beaumont dressed as Alice to better aid her with \\"getting into character\\". Despite not being trained as a singer, she also provided Alice's singing voice, as Disney envisioned the songs as possessing a \\"childlike feel\\" to them. She also appears in many episodes of Disney's House of Mouse and in the direct-to-video releases Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse and Mickey's House of Villains. She is now voiced by Hynden Walch.All About Hynden! Retrieved 29 January 2013 Alice can be seen as a meetable character in the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.

One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. Background Before the election a coalition between the 26 Liberal Democrats, 7 Labour and 3 independents ran the council, while the 23 Conservatives were in opposition. There were also one seat vacant after the death of the Labour councillor for Wivenhoe Quay Steve Ford. 20 seats were being contested, with the candidates including a full slate from the Green party and 13 from the UK Independence Party, more than the party had put forward at any previous local election in Colchester. 6 sitting councillors stood down at the election including the then mayor, Colin Sykes. Election result Only one seat changed hands at the election, with Labour's Chris Pearson gaining Berechurch from the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats held the other 9 seats they had been defending, holding Castle by 46 votes over the Conservatives and Old Heath (formerly Harbour ward) by 69 votes from Labour. The Conservatives gained an increased share of the vote at the election, but did not gain any more seats. Meanwhile, the UK Independence Party picked up 16% of the vote, coming second in 9 wards, but failed to take any seats. This was despite the party topping the polls in Colchester with 35% at the European parliamentary election that was held at the same time as the council election, and coming closest to taking a seat in Tiptree where the Conservatives held the seat by 85 votes. Following the election, councillor Laura Sykes left the Liberal Democrats and joined the Highwoods Independent group on the council (renamed to Highwoods & Stanway Independents), after a long-standing dispute with another Liberal Democrat councillor.

Biography Feliks M≈Çynarski was born to Jan M≈Çynarski, a school teacher, and Honorate n√©e Jƒôdrzejowska. He attended a gymnasium in Jaros≈Çaw, but because of his involvement in organizing meetings in favor of Polish independence, he was expelled by the Austrian authorities, and had to finish his secondary education at a school in Sanok, in 1903. M≈Çynarski finished the Jagiellonian University in Poland. As a youth, he was active in the endecja movement, but broke ranks with it prior to World War I due to its leader Roman Dmowski's pro-Russian orientation. In 1914 he joined Polish Legions, and spent some time in the United States recruiting members for the Legions from among the American Polonia. After the war he joined the newly formed government of the Second Polish Republic. In the years 1921‚Äì1923 he directed the Emigration Office. From 1923 he was employed at the Ministry of Finance, and the following year he became the director of the Currency Department of the Ministry. He took part in the Grabski Monetary Reform of 1924, which ended hyperinflation in interwar Poland and was a co- creator of the (second) Bank of Poland for which he served as vice-president between September 1924 and September 1924. In the years 1925‚Äì1927 he helped negotiated several economic agreements between Poland and the United States. He fell out of favor with the sanacja government of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and resigned from governmental positions in 1929. In the 1930s he taught at the Warsaw Trade Academy, and consulted for the League of Nations on currency issues. During World War II he became, with the approval of the Polish Government in exile, the president of the German operated Bank of Issue in Poland. As a result, the currency notes used during the occupation were popularly known as \\"M≈Çynarki\\", after him.Andrzej Gojski, Etapy i cele niemieckiej polityki bankowej w GG. Plany niemieckie wobec Generalnego Gubernatorstwa w latach 1939‚Äì1945, BANK I KREDYT, August 2004, pdf After the war, in 1945, he became a member of the Polish Academy of Science in People's Republic of Poland. Between 1945 and 1948 he taught at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. His war time collaboration with the Germans, even through approved by the Polish underground government of that time, cast a shadow on his career, and resulted in refusal to grant him a professorship position. He also served as the director of the library of Cracow University of Economics. Works M≈Çynarski authored numerous works from the fields of economy, sociology and philosophy. In his 1929 book Gold and Central Banks M≈Çynarski identified a fundamental instability in a gold-based international monetary system: the reserve currency countries would tend to accumulate foreign reserves, but as the volume of these grew relative to the country's gold reserves, international investors would begin to fear suspension of convertibility. The resulting outflow of reserves could create significant worldwide deflationary pressures and possibly lead to the collapse of the gold-based system. After World War II, the same problem was identified by the Belgian economist Robert Triffin, but in relation to the Bretton Woods system and became known as the Triffin dilemma. Due to M≈Çynarski's precedence in articulating the problem, Barry Eichengreen has suggested renaming the problem to \\"the M≈Çynarski dilemma\\".

They were named after the president of the bank, Feliks M≈Çynarski. History After the German invasion of Poland and the ensuing occupation, the Reichsbank decided not to introduce German currency there, as it did not want to increase the money supply. Various Polish banks and credit institutions were temporarily closed, while some of their assets were nationalized by the German government. Many people lost their savings.Zbigniew Landau, Jerzy Tomaszewski, The Polish Economy in the Twentieth Century, Published by Routledge, 1985, , Google Print, pp.168-169 On 15 December 1939, Hans Frank, the governor of the General Government, an administrative unit for most of occupied Poland, passed a decree creating a new bank, the Bank of Issue in Poland (Bank Emisyjny), which began operating in April the following year . The bank was headed by Feliks M≈Çynarski, with the approval of the Polish government in exile. The official exchange rate was set at 2 z≈Çoty for 1 reichsmark. The exchange system was meant to boost the German economy at the expense of the Polish one. The black market exchange rate varied between three and four z≈Çotys to a reichsmark.Andrzej Gojski, Etapy i cele niemieckiej polityki bankowej w GG.

The note is still popular among currency collectors. Counterfeiting of the currency was rampant. The name was also reflected in one of the actions of the Polish resistance, \\"Operation G√≥ral\\", a 1943 heist in which the insurgents took over a currency shipment worth over a million contemporary US dollars. The 500 note was also the standard \\"unit of corruption\\"; the minimum bribe that representatives of the occupation authorities required to facilitate the carrying out of illicit activity. In that role it was immortalized in the popular underground street song of Warsaw, Siekiera, motyka. The currency notes were used exclusively within the General Government, but not the Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany. They were withdrawn from circulation between 1944 and 1945.

A requirement of the ECB‚Ä¢S certification is a type testing according to European Standards. The type test is based on an authentic and real-life simulation e.g. of a burglary or a fire. The result of the test leads to the qualification of the product (e.g. resistance grade I, II, III for a safe). Ongoing audits in the manufacturing plants are necessary to maintain an equal quality.  Insurance  The ECB‚Ä¢S certification gives insurance companies a basis for the calculation of risks. Very often insurance companies assure worths only if they are kept in a tested and certified secure storage unit. Therefore it is recommended also by governmental bodies, e.g. the police, to better choose certified security broducts in doubt.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/526557/Security_Guidance_for_all_Businesses_and_Other_Organisations- _Final-_May_2016.pdf The storage of weapons or medicine can require certified secure storage products.

Her father Gopinath Munde was Deputy CM of Maharashtra in 1990s. Pankaja Munde was the Minister of Rural and Women, Child Development in the Devendra Fadnavis cabinet. She is known as a 'businesswoman' in the Sugar Factory sector & Bank sector. She received 'The Powerful Politician' award in the year 2017 and one of the mass leader and firebrand leaders from Maharashtra state.  Early life  Pankaja Munde was born on 26 July 1979 to Gopinath Munde and Pradnya Munde. She has two younger siblings, Pritam Munde and Yashashari. She completed her graduation and also holds an MBA. She is a niece of Pramod Mahajan, and a cousin to Rahul Mahajan and Poonam Mahajan. Political career Pankaja Munde served as the State President of BJP's youth wing, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), in 2012. She was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Maharashtra from Parli constituency in 2009. She took oath as Maharashtra Cabinet Minister on 31 October 2014. She was allotted Ministry of Rural Development, Women & Child welfare. Before 2014 Maharashtra assembly election, Maharashtra BJP announced a two-week \\"Punha Sangharsh Yatra\\" which was planned & led by Pankaja Munde along the lines of a Sangharsh Yatra undertaken by her father in 1995 after which the Shiv Sena-BJP came to power in the state. The 14 days long yatra started on 27 August 2014. Politicians like Amit Shah, Smriti Irani, Rajiv Pratap Rudy attended this Yatra. Pankaja Munde covered 79 assembly constituencies by doing 600 rallies and 3500 km of road journey. ‚ÄòPunha Sangharsh Yatra‚Äô got an overwhelming response and supporters of Pankaja Munde wanted her as Chief Minister of Maharashtra but she never aspired or planned to pitch herself as chief minister. She said she just wanted to play a key role in ensuring the BJP comes to power. During her tour and during the poll campaigns, people said she should take her father's place. People cheered for her at Amit Shah‚Äôs rally too. But she always said that she likes to be the kingmaker, not the king. Purpose of her Yatra was to ensure the state gets a BJP government and a CM. She is also known for arranging a memorial of her father and senior BJP leader, Gopinath Munde, at Parli in Beed district. The 20-feet tall statue of him, called Gopinath Gad, was commenced after his death in a 2014 road accident and is sited on the premises of the Vaidyanath Cooperative Sugar Mill. Social activities, drought relief, skill development, education scholarship & many such activities have been started to conducting through 'Gopinath Gad' Prathisthan. In June 2015, the opposition party Indian National Congress accused her of being involved in the chikki scam, alleging that she had flouted norms by clearing the purchase without floating tenders. Munde rejected the accusations of corruption, arguing that a policy for an online tendering system was not in place when she commissioned the purchase. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also defended her, stating that the norm of inviting e-tenders was introduced by his government in April, two months after Munde cleared the contracts. After a few days, Anti Corruption Bureau, Maharashtra gave a clean chit to Pankaja Munde in connection with the 206 crore Chikki scandal alleged by the opposition and said the tender was given in compliance with the court's rules, with no facts in this regard. She also got a huge reprieve as the snacks supplied to schools was found unadulterated and fit for consumption by two government labs. Personal life Pankaja married to Amit Palwe. The couple has one son name as Aryaman. She has authored a photobiography of her father, titled Lokneta Gopinath Munde. Dasara (Dussehra) Melava The tradition of Dasara (Dussehra) Melava is of devotion and strength, and this tradition was started by Gopinath Munde twenty-five years ago at Bhagwangad, which is the cemetery and workplace of the great Saint Bhagwan Baba. For this Melava, Gopinath Munde addressed the Bahujan community to set new directions and conditions, i.e., 'Shimoullanghan'; To start something new. After his death, the place was taken over by his successor daughter Pankaja Munde. In 2016, Pankaja Munde decided to take Dasara Melava at Savargaon, the birthplace of great Saint Bhagwan Baba, due to a dispute with the Mahant of the Gad. The Dasara Melava which took place in a large crowd and enthusiasm; Pankaja Munde has been successful in making the same melava in Savargaon. Bhagwangad is a place of power of the Bahujan and Other Backward Class OBC community. So far, as many people have attended the rally and addressed the gathering; include veterans like Sambhaji Raje , Amit Shah, Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar , Mahadev Jankar, Eknath Khadse, Ram Shinde many other monk-saint.

He is currently the chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, director of the UPMC Eye Center, and the Eye and Ear Foundation Chair of Ophthalmology. Dr. Sahel previously lead the Vision Institute (French: Institut de la Vision) in Paris, a research center associated with the one of the oldest eye hospitals of Europe - Quinze-Vingts National Eye Hospital in Paris, founded in 1260. He is a pioneer in the field of artificial retina and eye regenerative therapies. He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences. Biography Jos√©-Alain Sahel was born in Tlemcen (Algeria) in 1955. He has studied medicine in the Strasbourg University and in Lariboisi√®re, St. Louis. In 1980 he received a Doctorate of Medicine with a Medal of the Faculty of Paris and in 1984 obtained his Specialisation in Ophthalmology. He spent his first 20 professional years in the University Hospital of Strasbourg working as ophthalmologist and after moved to Quinze- Vingts National Eye Hospital in Paris, where he became department head in 2001. At the same period he held a position of the Chief of Ophthalmology and Pathology Service at Adolphe de Rothschild Foundation. Jos√©-Alain Sahel also held the chair of the Professor of Ophthalmology at the University Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris and the Professor of Biomedical Sciences (Cumberlege Chair) at University College London. He was also a Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where he collaborated with the world's leading specialists in the field, professors Daniel Albert and John Dowling. In October 2016, Jos√©-Alain Sahel was hired by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine as chair of the Department of Ophthalmology, the director of the UPMC Eye Center, and the Eye and Ear Foundation Chair of Ophthalmology. Research Jos√©-Alain Sahel has contributed to advancements in basic and clinical research in the field of the vision. In 1992 he founded the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Physiopathology of the Retina in Strasbourg that specialized in translational research on the mechanisms of retinal cell degeneration. Later this laboratory became the heart of the Vision Institute that Jos√©-Alain Sahel founded in Paris in 2008. This institute is one of the largest centres of integrated research on eye diseases in Europe and combines fifteen academic and clinical teams employing more than 250 researchers. There he continued his research on developmental biology, functional genomics, physiology and therapeutics (stem cells, gene therapy, pharmacology, artificial retina), research on relevant biomarkers and disease models. The common thread of his work is understanding and prevention of central vision loss through degeneration of photoreceptor cells (retinitis pigmentosa genetic) and age-related degeneration (AMD). One of the major discoveries made by Jos√©-Alain Sahel and his colleagues Thierry L√©veillard and Saddek Mohand-Said is that the rod photoreceptors produce a trophic factor (called sustainability factor cones or RdCVF for Rod-derived Cone Viability Factor) which uses the cone photoreceptors to survive. This discovery provided the biological basis for paracrine interactions between rods and cones showing that these interactions play a key role in maintaining the viability of photoreceptor cells. RdCVF through these factor could preserve central vision in some blinding human diseases. Clinical research led by Jos√©-Alain Sahel is closely entangled with the experimental research: information processing, genetic, therapeutic research, including modelling, evidence of pre-clinical concepts, technological developments in imaging and surgery, forming an integrated site research on diseases of vision. Conducted clinical research include the first clinical gene therapy trials (Stargardt) with a North American center and integrated clinical of French National Reference Center on Retinal dystrophies with participation of more than 5000 patients. Jos√©-Alain Sahel coordinates large-scale European research programs on the retina, functional genomics, retinal neuroprotection, aging, and more recently on theraputicd. Jos√©-Alain Sahel is also a coordinator of a network of over 80 centres of excellence in clinical trials of retinal diseases among Europeans. Research of Jos√©-Alain Sahel is also focused on the search for new therapeutic strategies to regain sight of visually impaired and blind people. He is one of the pioneers (with the Study Group on the retinal implant Argus II) in the Research on visual prostheses that could potentially become a breakthrough therapy for visually disabled patients, and allow them to regain some autonomy with recognition of objects or words, orientation and mobility. The results obtained and published as part of an international multicentre trial on retinal prostheses have resulted in FDA authorisation. With the research team of Dr. Botond Roska at the Friedrich Miescher from Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland, the research group of Jos√©-Alain Sahel and Serge Picaud was among the first transforme through optogenetics cells an artificial retina retinal photoreceptors connected to circuit and to use gene therapy to restore vision. They also succeeded in showing that patients receiving this therapy is applicable can be identified and selected by non- invasive methods retinal imaging in high resolution, allowing to quickly benefit these patients discoveries from the laboratory. New high-resolution retinal imaging tools are also developed by Jos√©-Alain Sahel and his colleagues (optical coherence tomography, adaptive optics with Michel Paques), to refine the characterization of functional deficits and dispose of specific therapeutic efficacy and reproductibles markers. Currently, Jos√©-Alain Sahel is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of several public and private institutions : Faculty of Medicine Pierre and Marie Curie, Foundation Fighting Blindness, Steering Committee of the European Vision Institute (EVI EEIG), Chairman of the Steering Committee of European Vision Institute - Clinical Trials - Sites of excellence (EVI- CR), City of Paris. He serves on several editorial boards of prestigious journals such as the Journal of Clinical Investigation, Science Translational Medicine, JAMA - Ophthalmology, Progress in retinal and Eye Research . The work of Jos√©-Alain Sahel and colleagues resulted in the publication of over 300 scientific papers and specialty generalist journals and fifty chapters in specialized books (in North American majority). Jos√©-Alain Sahel has given more than 250 guest lectures, including: reading Wilmer (Johns Hopkins, 2003), the Leopold reading (Irvine, Ca, 2007), the reading Euretina (Vienna, 2008), the ARVO ( pre and - ARVO ) symposia, the Leopoldina Academy (2009), the College of France, at the Pasteur Institute, University Hadassah, before the German Societies, French, Israeli Neuroscience at the ISOPT the ISOCB, the ' ISER, ESF, Jules Gonin Play of the Retina Research Foundation, Reykjavik (2012) Jos√©-Alain Sahel is also co-inventor and co-owner of more than twenty patents.

For twenty years, Somerville was editor of the British Heart Journal.  Childhood and Education  Walter Somerville was born in October 1913 in Clontarf, a seaside suburb of Dublin. He received his early education at the Jesuit Belvedere College in Dublin. Aged 23, he qualified in medicine, surgery and obstetrics from the city's University College in 1937. He was appointed house physician at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital where he gained a degree as Doctor of Medicine.  Military Service  Somerville applied to join the RAF, but was instead enlisted in the army and sent to India. Indicating that he had no wish to become an army doctor, he was instead returned to Britain and seconded to the government's Chemical Warfare Establishment at Porton Down. In 1943, he was seconded to the US War Department, where he helped with preparations for the invasion of Japan, during which he was badly burned, and left with scars on his face, feet and legs. On leaving the army, a friend with connections in the pharmaceutical industry suggested Somerville might find a job there, but he turned the offer down, just as he did the MGM talent scout who offered him a screen test because of his English accent and good looks.  Medical career  After being demobbed and returning to Britain, Somerville took a refresher course at Hammersmith Hospital, led by renowned cardiologist Paul Wood. Wood was impressed by Somerville and offered him the post of registrar at the hospital. In 1948 Somerville assisted Paul Wood with Britain's first cardiac catheterization. In 1952, Somerville was appointed as a consultant at Harefield Hospital, and two years later assumed a similar role at the Middlesex Hospital. Somerville was editor of the British Heart Journal for twenty years from 1973. The journal was the official publication of the British Cardiac Society, of which he was president from 1976 to 1981. He was responsible for encouraging greater links with cardiac experts in the US and Europe. After negotiating a better publishing deal with BMA Publications, he used the money towards the purchase of a house in London's Fitzroy Square, which was to become home to the British Cardiac Society.  Marriage  In 1957 Somerville married Jane Platnauer. The couple had four children, and Jane Somerville became a world-renowned cardiologist in her own right. She now lives in London and lectures internationally.  Honours  In 1982 Dr. Somerville was appointed a CBE. The following year he was appointed by Queen Elizabeth as a consultant to the King Edward VII Convalescent Home in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. He was also given the Legion of Merit for his wartime work for the US Army.

In 1987, Massare published an analysis of plesiosaur feeding habits. She concluded that the long-necked plesiosauroids ate soft prey. Liopleurodon and its relatives, on the other hand, had teeth resembling those of killer whales and probably ate larger, bonier prey. The next year, Massare analyzed Mesozoic marine reptile swimming abilities and found that long-necked plesiosaurs would have been significantly slower than pliosaurs due to excess drag incurred from their large round bodies.

Plants must either be able to survive the severe flooding conditions or be able to reestablish themselves before the next flooding event. Some of these plants have evolved so that in order for their seeds to germinate, the seeds must be scarified or abraded by tumbling sand, gravel, and rocks during the flooding event. They must then quickly send down roots deep enough to be able to tap into deep underground water reserves, in order to survive the dry period after the flooding. Common dominant species of the desert dry wash include smoke tree (Psorothamnus spinosus), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), catclaw (Senegalia greggii), cheesebush (Ambrosia salsola), and waterweed (Baccharis sergiloides).
