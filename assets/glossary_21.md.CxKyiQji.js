He has been a professor of philosophy at Emory University since fall 2015. He is also a distinguished Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College, one of the college's highest honors. In 2019-20, he was the University of Pennsylvania's Inaugural Provost's Distinguished Visiting Faculty Fellow. He is also the editor for Lexington Books' \\"Philosophy of Race\\" book series. He is known for his work in critical whiteness studies, critical philosophy of race, critical phenomenology (especially racial embodiment), and African American philosophy, and has written, edited, or co-edited more than 20 books. He has also authored over 150 scholarly articles and chapters. Yancy has also authored numerous influential essays and conducted provocative interviews at The New York Times' philosophy column \\"The Stone.\\" Yancy has been interviewed on various radio stations throughout the U.S. He has also appeared in two documentaries, Lillian Smith: Breaking the Silence, an independent documentary directed by Hal Jacobs and Henry Jacobs, with support from Georgia Humanities, 2019, and Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story, a six-episode series released on July 30, 2018 on Paramount Network. Series was directed by Jenner Furts and Julia Willoughby Nason. Executive producers: Sybrina Fulton, Tracy Martin, Jay-Z, Chachi Senior, Michael Gasparro, Jenner Furst, Julia Willoughby Nason, and Nick Sandow. Education and career Yancy received his B.A. in philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh cum laude in 1985, his M.A. in philosophy from Yale University in 1987, his M.A. in Africana studies from New York University (NYU) in 2004, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Duquesne University with distinction in 2005. He began teaching at Duquesne in 2005, progressing from assistant professor to full professor in just eight years, 2005-2013. After teaching at Duquesne for ten years, he moved to teach philosophy at Emory University in 2015. At the University of Pittsburgh, Yancy wrote his undergraduate honors thesis on Bertrand Russell's Sense Data theory. His honors thesis was directed by prominent American philosopher and epistemologist Wilfrid Sellars. Also at Pitt, he studied Kant under Nicholas Rescher, studied with Adolf Grunbaum on Freud's theory of religion, studied Martin Heidegger under John Haugeland, ancient Greek philosophy under Alexander Nehamas, and modern philosophy under Annette Baier. \\"Dear White America\\" In 2015, Yancy published an article in the New York Times' philosophy column, The Stone, entitled \\"Dear White America\\", which proved very controversial and resulted in his receiving large amounts of hate mail and harassment. This experience later helped convince the American Philosophical Association to issue a statement denouncing bullying and harassment. It also resulted in his being added to the Professor Watchlist, a website which purports to document anti-conservative college professors, in 2016. Anne Leighton was also instrumental in bringing attention and support through creating a petition in support of Yancy. Also, 68 philosophers and intellectuals wrote a letter in his defense. In response to being placed on the Professor Watchlist, Yancy wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times entitled \\"I am a Dangerous Professor.\\" Works =Books= * Across Black Spaces: Essays and Interviews from an American Philosopher.

Overview According to this law, the current decays according to a power law: : Ileft(tright) propto t^{-n}, where Ileft(tright) is the current at a given charging time, t, and n is the decay constant such that 0. Given that the dielectric has a finite conductance, the equation for current measured through a dielectric under a DC electrical field is: : Ileft(tright) = at^{b} + c, where a is a constant of proportionality, b is the decay constant (i.e., b=-n), and c is the intrinsic conductance of the dielectric. This stands in contrast to the Debye formulation, which states that the current is proportional an exponential function with a time constant, tau, according to: : Ileft(tright) propto expleft{-t/ tauright} . The Curie‚Äìvon Schweidler behavior has been observed in many instances such as those shown by Andrzej Ka Johnscher and Jameson et al. It has been interpreted as a many-body problem by Jonscher, but can also be formulated as an infinite number of resistor-capacitor circuits. This comes from the fact that the power law can be expressed as: : t^{-n} = frac{1}{Gammaleft(nright)} int_0^infty tau^{-left(n+1right)} e^{-t/ tau} dtau, where Gammaleft(nright) is the Gamma function. Effectively, this relationship shows the power law expression to be equivalent to an infinite weighted sum of Debye responses.

Characters *Thyestis umbra (Thyestes' ghost), uncle of Agamemnon *chorus *Clytemnestra, wife of Agamemnon *nutrix (nurse) *Aegisthus, son of Thyestes, lover of Clytemnestra *Eurybates, messenger of Agamemnon. *Cassandra, Trojan princess, captive of Agamemnon *Agamemnon, king of Myceneae, and leader of the Greeks in the Trojan War. *Electra, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra *Strophius, king of Phocis, husband of Agamemnon's sister *Orestes (silent role), son of Agamemnon, brother of Electra *Pylades (silent role), son of Strophius, friend of Orestes The scene is laid partly inside and partly outside the palace of Agamemnon at Argos or Mycenae, on the day of the return of the king from his long absence at Troy, beginning in the period of darkness just preceding the dawn. Plot The blood-feud between Atreus and Thyestes was not ended with the vengeance which Atreus wreaked upon his brother. It was fated that Thyestes should live to father upon his own daughter a son, Aegisthus, who would slay Atreus and bring ruin and death upon Agamemnon. The Trojan War is done, and now the near approach of the victorious king Agamemnon, bringing his captives and treasure home to Argos, has been announced. But his wife Clytemnestra, enraged at Agamemnon because he had sacrificed her daughter Iphigenia at Aulis to appease the winds, and full of jealousy because he brings Cassandra as her rival home, estranged also by the long-continued absence of her husband, but most estranged by her own guilty affair with Aegisthus, is now plotting to slay her husband on his return, gaining both revenge and safety from his anger. =Act I= The ghost of Thyestes, arriving from the underworld, calls upon his son Aegisthus to carry out the revenge which had been promised him by the oracle. The Chorus of the Women of Argos or Mycenae complains of exalted fortune as unstable, full of anxieties and cares, and therefore gives preference to a modest life. =Act II= Clytemnestra, conscious of her own wickedness, and fearing punishment for her adultery now that her husband has just returned, meditates the destruction of Agamemnon as a remedy. The Nurse however, dissuades her from adopting such a step. Aegisthus comes on the scene and finds Clytemnestra in a hesitating mood and prepared to yield to the wise counsels of the Nurse. He succeeds in diverting Clytemnestra from her new-born resolution, and on again towards her rash purpose. The chorus of the women of Mycenae and Argos sing a triumphal hymn in honor of Apollo on account of the victory gained at Troy, but introduce laudatory addresses to Juno, Minerva and Jupiter. =Act III= Eurybates reports that Agamemnon has returned and is now approaching‚Äîthat a tempest was visited upon them by Pallas, which was made worse for them, through the treachery of Nauplius. Sacrifices are prepared for the gods, and a feast is got ready for Agamemnon. The captives are brought forward. The Chorus of Trojans bewail the fates and the misfortunes of Troy. Cassandra is seized with one of her prophesying fits, and foretells what dangers are threatening Agamemnon. =Act IV= Cassandra, when Agamemnon returns, predicts his fate, but she is not believed. The Chorus of Argos Women sing the praises of Hercules, especially as he was brought up at Argos, and they maintain that his arrows were required by the Fates, for the second downfall of Troy. =Act V= Cassandra, although she (actually) sees nothing, and is only in the proscenium, foretells what is to happen, and she narrates everything that is progressing in the banqueting hall to those outside concerning the slaughter of Agamemnon. Electra persuades her brother Orestes to take flight and luckily encounters Strophius. She hands Orestes over to Strophius to be carried away. Electra flies to the altar for protection. Clytemnestra orders Electra to be dragged away from the altar and thrown into prison. Clytemnestra orders death for Cassandra. Sources There is no earlier known play which serves as an obvious model for Seneca's Agamemnon. The play tells the roughly same story as the Agamemnon by Aeschylus. However the characterisation, structure, and themes of Seneca's play are very different from Aeschylus's play. Agamemnon has only a relatively minor role in Seneca's play, compared with Clytemnestra and Cassandra who have large parts. Other (lost) plays which might have influenced Seneca include Agamemnon by Ion of Chios, Aegithus by Livius Andronicus, and Clytemnestra by Accius.

Commanded by General Johann Pflugbeil, the unit was deployed in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union, in the Army Group Centre Rear Area, for security and Bandenbek√§mpfung (\\"anti-bandit\\") duties. It was responsible for large-scale war crimes and atrocities including the deaths of thousands of Soviet civilians. Operational history =Formation and Operation Barbarossa= The division was formed in June 1941. Along with Wehrmacht army troops, it included Police Battalion 309 of the Orpo (uniformed police), its only motorised formation. The unit spent three months at the front and six months on rear-area security duties in the Gomel area. Its duties included ensuring the security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting partisans in the Wehrmacht's rear areas. In September 1941, the officers of the division attended the Mogilev conference, organised by General Max von Schenckendorff, commander of Army Group Centre Rear Area. The conference, while ostensibly on \\"anti-partisan training\\", resulted in a dramatic increase in atrocities against Jews and other civilians in the last three months of 1941. The division reported shooting 1,847 \\"partisans\\" in two months alone. Hostage-taking also increased dramatically. Wehrmacht units were receiving directives that 50 to 100 \\"communists\\" were to be killed as atonement for the death of each German soldier. =Activities in 1942= In March 1942, the division embarked on large-scale Nazi security warfare operations in the Yelnya-Dorogobuzh area east of Smolensk. The so-called anti-partisan operations in \\"bandit-infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, seizure of livestock, deportation of the able-bodied population for slave labour to Germany and murder of those of non-working age. The tactics included shelling villages not under German control with heavy weapons, resulting in mass civilian casualties. General Johann Pflugbeil directed his troops that the \\"goal of the operation is not to drive the enemy back, but to exterminate him\\". During the operation, the unit recorded 278 German troops killed, while 806 enemies were reported killed in action and 120 prisoners were handed over to Wehrmacht's Secret Field Police for execution. Only 200 weapons (rifles, machine-guns and pistols) were seized. =Later history= The division saw brief front-line duty in October 1943 fighting the Soviet Red Army troops at Gomel. In November, it was again transferred to rear-security duties (Bandenbek√§mpfung) in Belarus. The unit was largely destroyed during the Soviet Red Army summer offensive, Operation Bagration, in June 1944. The surviving personnel were absorbed into other security units.

In addition to its architectural beauty, the Convento de Santo Domingo holds precious sacred objects, such as the Christ of Expiration. The chroniclers say that in 1754 an epidemic of smallpox spread, which could only be stopped after praying for nine days to this image, which is why this Christ is an object of special devotion for the Cartagenians. Legend of the origin The origin of the Christ of Expiration also has its miraculous chronicle. According to tradition, the novices found a piece of wood by the sea that they gathered with the idea of carving the image of Christ. Taking advantage of the fact that in those days spent an unknown carver in the Dominican convent, they decided to propose the idea to him. Asked the pilgrim carver, he said that the log was very short for the proposed work. Then the fathers returned the log to the sea. Days later the religious returned to the beach and found the same tree, but now it measured enough to carve the image. The artisan agreed to do the work, but asked not to be interrupted and to have the food delivered through a window of the room, where he locked himself up for several days. After a couple of weeks the religious stopped listening to the craftsman carving. Worried about this unusual silence, they decided to enter the room. There they found the image of Christ at the moment of expiration, but no trace of the craftsman. This led to the legend that it was an angel sent by God to make the venerated Christian image. This image was preserved for years in a Baroque style altar, that altar dating from 1807, and is the work of the Cartagenian artist Hermenegildo Jos√© de Ayala. Cristo de la Expiraci√≥n Day The Cristo de la Expiraci√≥n, whose devotion is expressed through prayers, songs and praises, is honored with the pilgrimages that September 14 are made to the temple of Santo Domingo, from where one of the most massive processions that take place in the Historic Center of Cartagena de Indias. The event begins with a tour of the main streets of the sector.

The victorious Greeks have gathered the rich spoils of Troy upon the shore, among these the Trojan women who await their lot to be assigned to their Greek lords and taken to the cities of their foes. But now the ghost of Achilles has risen from the tomb, and demanded that Polyxena be sacrificed to him before the Greeks shall be allowed to sail away. And Calchas, also, bids that Astyanax be slain, for only then can Greece be safe from any future Trojan war. =Act I= Hecuba laments with the Chorus of Trojans the destruction of their country and the death of Hector and Priam. =Act II= Talthybius relates that the Ghost of Achilles has appeared, and reproving the Greeks for their ingratitude, demanded that Polyxena, under the pretext of marriage with whom, he was slain, should be sacrificed at his tomb as an offering to the chthonic gods. Otherwise the Greeks will not have a favourable wind for their return. Agamemnon and Pyrrhus quarrel about the sacrifice. Calchas is summoned and he asserts that not only must Polyxena be slain, but Astynax must also be hurled from the tower. The Chorus denies that Achilles appeared as a spirit, and asserts that the soul dies forever with the body. =Act III= Andromache having taken alarm at a vision in her dream, hides away her son in his father's tomb. Ulysses in his cleverness discovers where he is, and drags him forth to meet his death. Andromache mingles curses and threats with her supplications entreating Ulysses, but not prevailing upon him. The Trojans, once allotted to the Greeks, are to be conveyed to various parts of Greece‚Äîsome to Sparta, some to Mycenae, some to Ithaca, and to the country of Helen, Agamemnon and Ulysses. =Act IV= The plan is discussed as to how the sacrifices to the chthonic gods and manes of Achilles are to be conducted; and in what garments, Polyxena, who is to be sacrificed under the impression of a real marriage, is to be arrayed. Also what part shall be played by Helen, in order that she may cajole Polyxena with the vain hope of marrying Pyrrhus: she at first, keeps up the pretence, but after a time dismisses the deception, having argued with Andromache, she confesses everything and openly recommends the fulfilment of the scheme. The Chorus derives consolation from the misfortune being shared by so many; \\"as if for the wretched to have companions in sorrow were a solace,\\" and then draws attention to the fact that the solace in question will lose its efficacy, as they will be separated by the allotting that has been going on. =Act V= The Messenger informs the mothers, Hecuba and Andromache, that Astyanax has been hurled from the tower and Polyxena slain at the tomb of Achilles.

Scott Smith wrote that Seneca's attempt in the work to weave two episodes together \\"means that the play is somewhat dissociated ‚Äì a 'flaw' that critics have sometimes brought to bear against it\\", but stated that \\"in the place of unity, however, there is symmetry.\\" References Further reading * Elaine Fantham, Seneca‚Äôs Troades: A literary introduction with text, translation, and commentary.

Hercules being at that time away in the underworld, where he had gone to seek out Cerberus as the final labour assigned him by Eurystheus through Juno's hatred. Here he found Theseus, who had made a descent into the regions of Pluto in company of Pirithous with the intention of carrying off Proserpine. Lycus seized his opportunity, and aided by conspirators, slayed Creon together with his two sons, and usurped the Kingdom of Thebes. =Act I= Juno vents her anger at the love affairs of Jupiter, his concubines and bastard offspring, and is very angry about the successes of Hercules, and so on his return from the underworld will be thrown by Juno into a state of mad frenzy. The Chorus of Thebans beginning with a description of the dawn of day alludes to the customs of the times, condemning the pursuits and undertakings of the nobles. They reprove Hercules for his audacity in the attempting of his various labors, and finally extol and sigh for the tranquillity which is only to be found in leading a retired life. =Act II= Megara bewails the absence of Hercules, and complains of the violence and insolence of Lycus. Amphitryon pities the despondent state of Megara's mind, and tenders his consolation. Lycus, having slain Creon and his sons, has established himself on the throne and governs the kingdom. He seeks to marry Megara, using every stratagem, and threatens violence in case she refuses. =Act III= Hercules asks for the pardon of Phoebus and the rest of the Gods, that although having been commanded, he had dragged Cerberus from the underworld to the regions above. Hercules having returned from the underworld with Theseus encounters Amphitryon who greets him and informs him about events. Hercules goes off to kill Lycus. Theseus provides Amphitryon with an account of the underworld and the deeds of Hercules. The Chorus sings of the victory of Hercules gained in the underworld, and praises the hero. =Act IV= Hercules having returned after the slaughter of Lycus, as he is about to offer sacrifices to the Gods whom he has invoked, becomes mad and under the influence of his madness, he kills his wife and children, and then falls into a deep sleep! =Act V= Hercules wakes, with his mind restored, and learns that he has killed his own children. He prepares to kill himself, but prevailed on, by the appeals of Amphitryon and Theseus, he refrains from suicide, and at the suggestion of Theseus, he starts for Athens, to undergo the ordeal of atonement for his mad acts.

It tells the story of Hercules' betrayal by his jealous wife, Deianira, followed by his death and apotheosis. The general opinion is that the play is not Seneca's, but was written in close imitation. Authorship The play was first rejected by Daniel Heinsius in the 17th century, It is worth noting that Heinsius also rejected Seneca's Phoenissae, and he ascribed Hercules Furens, Thyestes, Oedipus, and Agamemnon, to Seneca's father. and the majority of modern critics agree that the play in its present form is not by Seneca. The work has many small differences in style from Seneca's other plays which \\"suggest a fundamentally different approach to playwriting\\". It is also around twice as long as Seneca's other plays, and is in fact the longest drama to survive from antiquity. Hercules Oetaeus contains numerous passages from Seneca's other plays which have been lifted out of context, reworked, and inserted into the play. The play's conclusion contains a strong Stoic theme which is not found in Seneca's other plays. However, there are still scholars who defend the play as authentic (albeit hastily written), or argue that a later hand reworked an incomplete fragment. Critics in favour of this view argue that the first third of the play (lines 1‚Äì705) could have originally been written by Seneca but that the end of the play is not his. Characters *Hercules, Son of Jupiter and Alcmena *Iole, Daughter of Eurytus, king of Oechalia *nutrix (nurse) *Deianeira, Daughter of Oeneus, king of Aetolia, and wife of Hercules *Hyllus, Son of Hercules and Deianira *Alcmena, Daughter of Electryon, king of Mycenae *Philoctetes, A prince of Thessaly, and friend of Hercules *Lichas (silent role) The messenger of Deianira to Hercules *Chorus, of Aetolian women, faithful to Deianira. *Band, of Oechalian women, suffering captivity in company with Iole. Plot The long, heroic life of Hercules has neared its end. His twelve great tasks, assigned him by Eurystheus through Juno's hatred, have been done. His latest victory was over Eurytus, king of Oechalia. Hercules slew the king and overthrew his house, because he would not give Hercules his daughter Iole in marriage. And now the hero, having overcome the world, and Pluto's realm beneath the earth, aspires to heaven. He sacrifices to Cenaean Jove, and prays at last to be received into his proper home. =Act I= The first scene, with the chorus following, is at Euboea, where Hercules, about to offer sacrifices on the promontory of Cenaeum, records his wishes for a place in the heavens, which he recounts and boasts he has deserved. (The rest of the Tragedy takes place at Trachis.) Iole joining in with the Chorus of Oechalians, bewails the destruction of her country, the slaughter of her father and kinsfolk and lastly, her own position of servitude. =Act II= Deianira, furious with jealousy having seen Iole, debates revenge with her nurse. She decides to send a garment to Hercules anointed with the blood of the centaur Nessus. She believes that it will act as love charm, but mentions how Nessus told her that the charm must be kept in darkness. The Chorus of Aetolian women bewail the lot of Deianira, they express their dislike of ambition, avarice, luxury and other frivolous pursuits of mankind, and praise the inferior conditions of life. =Act III= Deianira repents of her plan when she is acquainted with what danger the poison has brought about, and the calamity, as predicted from its exposure to the sun, has now taken place. Having learned about this from Hyllus, Deianira resolves to kill herself. The Chorus sings of everything as being subject to Death, regarding the failing strength of Hercules‚Äî \\"that nothing born or created is lasting,\\" which sentiment of Orpheus it praises, and they intersperse the Chorus with celebrating his divine art. =Act IV= Hercules complains about suffering undeservedly, and that he should be doomed to die an ignominious death, especially one arising out of a woman's treachery. Alcmena consoles Hercules, whilst lamenting his sad fate. Hyllus having returned, tells Hercules that Deianira, after she found that she had been deceived by Nessus, killed herself. The Chorus beseeches Phoebus to announce to all the world the death of Hercules: they predict the apotheosis of Hercules, and implore Jupiter, that there may be no more Tyrants, wild beasts or monsters, brought forth in the future, if so, that another Hercules may be forthcoming, as the avenger of such calamities. =Act V= Philoctetes announces the death and the last disposal of the body of Hercules. Alcmena grieves about her own downfall, arising out of the death of Hercules. Alcmena, in her grief, chants a funeral dirge. Hercules, having been raised to the companionship of the gods, consoles his grieving mother, being introduced into this scene by being lowered from the heavens above. The chorus breathes its thanks for the Apotheosis of Hercules, and is ready to worship the new Deity. Sources The first four acts follow the basic structure of Sophocles' play the Women of Trachis. However the scenes which describe Hercules's self- immolation and apotheosis at the end may be derived from Ovid's Metamorphoses (ix. 229-272).

The mosaic was originally constructed for an upscale villa in Daphne, just outside of Antioch. The mosaic was discovered during an archeological expedition which lasted between 1932 and 1939. It is currently the largest Antioch mosaic located within the United States. It measures approximately 20.5 feet x 23.3 feet.  History  Mosaics were an important form of Byzantine art and many examples were produced between the 6th and the 15th century AD.Kitzinger, Ernest. (1995) ‚ÄúByzantine Art in the Making: Main lines of Stylistic Development in Mediterranean Art, 3rd to 7th Century‚Äù Harvard University Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Worcester Hunt is a well-preserved example of sixth century Byzantine mosaics. Most large-scale works of Byzantine art during this period were commissioned by the Orthodox Church or wealthy patrons of the elite upper classes.Kitzinger, Ernest. Mosaics were a significant development during the sixth century and were commonly used to adorn the interior floors and walls of church buildings as a display of religious fervor and political authority. Located in the southwestern corner of Anatolia along the Mediterranean coastline, Daphne was an ancient resort community situated in the hills overlooking the Seleucid city of Antioch, which the Byzantines had inherited from the Roman Empire. Antioch was a strategically important city and sat upon the confluences of significant trade routes.Downey, Glanville. (1961) ‚ÄúA History of Antioch in Syria: From Seleucus to the Arab Conquests‚Äù. Princeton University Press. Princeton, New Jersey. The political and cultural significance of Antioch and its surrounding areas was displayed through grand artistic works such as floor mosaics. From the 3rd century onwards, mosaics became a popular form of ornamentation among the wealthy elite. The Worcester Hunt was constructed in the early sixth century, likely during the reign of Justinian I. It is unique among other well-known Byzantine mosaics because it was not located in a place of worship, and it does not depict religious themes. Pre-Iconoclastic mosaics such as the Worcester Hunt are valuable sources of early Byzantine art because the political and social upheaval of the Iconoclasm resulted in the destruction of many artistic creations including mosaics.Von Grunebaum, G.E. (1962) Pp. 1-10 ‚ÄúByzantine Iconoclasm and the Influence of the Islamic Environment‚Äù. History of Religions. Vol. 2 No. 1, The University of Chicago The scale of the Worcester Hunt and the location in which it was constructed suggests that it was the private property of a wealthy Byzantine aristocrat. This mosaic would have been the centerpiece of a large residence, built for the purpose of leaving a lasting impression upon guests. The scale of the Worcester Hunt in comparison to other privately- owned Byzantine works of this period demonstrates the extensive time and funding that would have been required to create such a piece. The relatively well-preserved state of this large mosaic is also notable because this region experienced frequent earthquakes throughout the centuries. In 1268, the Mamluks of Egypt sacked the city of Antioch and most of the inhabitants were killed while others were enslaved.Downey, Glanville. The population of Antioch continued a gradual decline over the next few centuries until all that remained of the city were a series of uninhabited ruins. One of the dismounted hunters in the mosaic uses a spear to kill dangerous game. In 1931, the \\"Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity\\" was created by a coalition of archaeologists funded by Louvre Museum, Baltimore Museum of Art, Worcester Art Museum, Princeton University, and Harvard University. The expedition began in 1932, but archaeologists did not locate any major buildings as they had intended. They did however manage to uncover a great deal of mosaics in Antioch and the surrounding areas, including the ones found at Daphne.Cimok, Fatih. (2004) ‚ÄúAntioch Mosaics‚Äù Milet Publishing. Some of the discoveries remained in modern-day Turkey while others such as the Worcester Hunt were purchased by educational institutions. In 1936, Worcester Museum acquired the Worcester Hunt mosaic, where it remains today.  Description  The mosaic features multiple hunters, who are presumed to be members of the Byzantine aristocracy. Some are riding horses while others are stationary. At the center of the piece stands a single hunter who observes others as they use bows, spears, and swords to subdue large, dangerous game animals. The mosaic also depicts younger animals that are not the target of the hunters. This feature indicates that the hunters may have possessed an understanding of conservation and that their efforts were deliberately aimed at preventing the extinction of these animals. Some of these animals (most notably the tiger) would have been considered exotic game as they were not native to the region. This piece is an excellent example of secular Byzantine art as it lacks any significant religious iconography or allusions. Although faded to a degree, much of the vivid coloring in this piece remains easily visible.  Stylistic influences  A hunter on horseback uses a bow to subdue dangerous game. The region surrounding Antioch represented a crossroads between the Eastern and Western art forms in the late antiquity and early medieval periods. This blending of artistic styles is reflected in several ways when examining the Worcester Hunt. The figures are all arranged in a circular pattern around a central figure, which is a trademark feature of ancient Persian artwork. While the garments of the hunters appear to be of Greco-Roman origin, some of the weapons observed have a more eastern-inspired style. The mosaic contains a somewhat abstract depiction of humans while the animals appear to be more detailed, giving them a more realistic appearance. Many artists of this period sought to evoke classical elements in their work and this resulted in a tendency to incorporate classical Greco-Roman principles into Byzantine art.Mango, Cyril. (1963). ‚ÄúAntique Statuary and the Byzantine Beholder‚Äù. Vol. 17 Dumbarton Oaks Papers. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291190 The various thematic elements showcased in the mosaic demonstrate how the artist incorporated styles from multiple cultures when constructing this piece. Byzantine art fluctuated between naturalistic and abstract depictions depending on social and religious factors.Mango, Cyril (1963).

Early life Helen was born to Mercy Ellen Wilkinson in Toronto, Ontario on February 7, 1899. Early in her life, she was sent to live with her adoptive aunt and uncle, Emma and George Barnard, in Vancouver, British Columbia. There she attended a French private school, as well as one year of public school, before moving with her aunt and uncle to Thornborough Ranch, a small farm in Howe Sound, British Columbia, where she was home-schooled. In an isolated area with no siblings, Helen occupied herself with long hikes, and she worked at jobs usually meant for boys (given that she had no brothers), such as meeting the steamer by rowboat to collect the groceries. Photography In 1916, at age seventeen, McCall apprenticed at Robert F.K. Brown's photography studio in Vancouver, where she learned silver finish photography. Later in 1916-1917, McCall worked as a clerk for photographer W.H. Calder, then worked at the Elite Studio in 1918, before returning to Howe Sound near the end of WWI.

The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. 2nd edition, ed. Barry Kernfeld. Valdambrini's professional career began in the late 1940s, when he played with Rex Stewart, and soon after co-led a small ensemble with Gianni Basso. Valdambrini's association with Basso would continue through the early 1960s. He also arranged and played as a sideman for Armando Trovajoli toward the end of the 1950s. In the 1960s he played with Gil Cuppini, Duke Ellington, and Giorgio Gaslini, and in the early 1970s worked with Maynard Ferguson. He joined forces again with Basso from 1972 to 1974, and played in the 1970s with Franco Ambrosetti, Conte Candoli, Dusko Goykovich, Freddie Hubbard, Mel Lewis, Frank Rosolino, Ernie Wilkins, and Kai Winding.

It is located between Cedar Street and Albany Street running along Washington Street, sharing a block with 90 West Street. It was built in 1931 and was designed by Renwick, Aspinwall & Guard. September 11 attacks When the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed on September 11, 2001, 130 Cedar Street was completely ravaged. Hundreds of tons of fiery debris rained down onto the building. The top of the building's northeast corner completely collapsed under the debris. A column section from WTC 2 penetrated the 10th floor roof slab. The projectile impacts also lit fires, which occurred primarily above the 9th floor. Fire damage was evident on the 11th and 12th floors in the northwest corner. The Amish Market located on the ground floor was completely destroyed and burned, later relocating further uptown. Several concrete columns were cracked, possibly from the impact. Several bays at the northeast corner were severely damaged from debris impact. After the attacks, the building was uninhabitable and lost all of its tenants.  Renovation  Like many buildings in the area, 130 Cedar Street had to be thoroughly decontaminated after the damage it sustained. In 2004, it was announced that the office building would be transformed into a hotel, despite rumors that the building would be demolished. After many years of revitalization, the building was finally reopened as a Club Quarters hotel. During the restoration process, seven new floors were added, making the building 19 stories tall.\\"Hotel Inventory Q4 2014\\" Alliance for Downtown New York References Financial District, Manhattan Skyscraper hotels in Manhattan Art Deco architecture in Manhattan Residential buildings completed in 1931 1931 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"130 Cedar Street"},{"id":"53477691","text":"Glenea oemeoides is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

It was an academic study on the migration, confinement, and resettlement of Japanese Americans during World War II. It aimed to document and examine the mass internment of Japanese Americans by embedding Nisei social science students recruited from the Berkeley campus into selected internment sites. The study also documented the resettlement phase in the city of Chicago. The collection consists of daily journals, field reports, life histories, and secondary research materials collected and compiled by the research staff. There is also extensive correspondence between staff, evacuees, and others. These records were deposited in the University Library in August 1948 by sociologist and Director of JERS, Dorothy Swaine Thomas. The JERS staff concentrated on Tule Lake, Gila River, and Poston/Colorado River, with minor involvement at Topaz/Central Utah, Manzanar, and Minidoka.

Moss-Christian, who has been working with fisheries for over 20 years, was the first woman to chair the WCPFC. She also advises the Marshall Islands Government on Oceans and Trade.  Early life and education  Born in the Marshall Islands, Moss-Christian commenced her career in fisheries by assisting the Marshall Islands Government in regional fisheries meetings and United Nations negotiations. Moss-Christian holds a Master of Arts in International Policy Studies, 2005 (Stanford University), a Post-Graduate Certificate in Diplomatic Studies, 2000 (Oxford University) and a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Politics, 1996 (University of California Santa Cruz). When working towards her degree at the University of California Santa Cruz, she became interested in fisheries.  Career  Moss-Christian moved to Majuro in 1996 and was chosen to represent the Marshall Islands at the 30th Forum Fisheries Committee. Moss-Christian made history in December 2014 as the first woman to be elected as chair of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission and was then elected to a second two-year term in December 2016, which was reported as a testament to the respect she had won from Commission members. The Commission membership includes all the major fishing nations from Europe, Asia and North America, as well as developing Pacific nations such as Indonesia and the Philippines. Moss-Christian and WCPFC Executive Director, Feleti Teo, have been notable for guiding Commission members to achieve more progress by setting realistic goals, given that member countries have different interests and perspectives. At the Commission's 2016 annual meeting, Moss-Christian highlighted the need to develop a harvest strategy, review conservation and management measures for key tunas such as Bigeye and Bluefin, mitigate bycatch and address the safety of commercial fishing boat observers who ensure Commission rules are being followed.

The children were handed over to the person asking least money from the authorities. The compensation was determined in descending English auctions, where the children were present. The lowest bidder became the child's foster-parent and was compensated with an annual amount equal to his bid. The foster-parents provided the child the housing, upbringing and education, but the children were often used as a child labour. Specially in the Finnish countryside the children sold in the auctions usually lived in a slavery-like conditions. They were also mistreated. Child auctions were prohibited in Sweden in 1918 and in Finland in 1923. Although, auctions were still organized in Finland until the late 1930s. The last known child auction was held in 1935. Some of the children were still living with their foster- parents in the 1940s. Among the notable people who were sold in the child auctions are the Swedish politician Fredrik Vilhelm Thorsson, who later became the Minister for Finance of Sweden, the Finnish politicians Eino Kujanp√§√§ and Jukka Lankila, and the Finnish author Joel Lehtonen. Similar practices were also carried out in other European countries, like the Verdingkinder institution in Switzerland.

The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. The barn is actually a T-shaped structure with a total of three levels. The longest portion of the building has two levels, ending on the south in a round stone structure that was originally a milk house. Perpendicular to this was a chicken coop. To the south of the chicken coop are two former silos made out of concrete block. The chicken coop extends over a drive, which ends at an apartment on the north end of the long portion. History Midway Barn was used most actively by Wright and his architectural apprentices in the \\"Taliesin Fellowship\\" (now the School of Architecture at Taliesin) from the time that the Fellowship began in 1932 until the end of the architect's life in 1959.Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, Frank Lloyd Wright: Completed Buildings, volume 3, 1943-1959 (Taschen, 2009), p. 57. . Midway Barns were constructed mostly in 1938 and were named for their location which was midway between Taliesin and Hillside. Dairy and machine sheds were added in 1947. The barn at one time had \\"[T]he Wrights' personal horses, cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, rabbits, [and] an Afghan hound or two\\",Earl Nisbet, Taliesin Reflections: My Years Before, During, and After Living with Frank Lloyd Wright (Meridian Press, 2006), p. 45. but also had several living spaces, including one for a \\"sheepherder\\".Lois Davidson Gottlieb, A Way of Life: An Apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright (Images Publishing Group Pty Ltd, 2001), p. 104. . Farming was important to Wright because of his own childhood experiences with it: when he was 11 years old, he began working on the farm, located nearby, owned by his uncle James Lloyd Jones.http://www.aldebaranfarm.us/history The architect later wrote that the trees in the surrounding hills \\"stood in it all like various, beautiful buildings, of more different kinds than all the architectures of the world. And the boy was some day to learn that the secret of all the human styles in architecture was the same that gave character to the trees.\\"Frank Lloyd Wright, Frank Lloyd Wright Collected Writings: 1930-32, volume 2. Edited by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, introduction by Kenneth Frampton (1992; Rizzoli International Publications, Inc., New York City, 1992), p. 123. As a result, when Wright began the Taliesin Fellowship he felt that exposing people to farm work, as former apprentice Curtis Besinger later wrote, was \\"fundamental to a person's development, particularly his understanding and appreciation of an 'organic architecture.'\\"Curtis Besinger, Working With Mr. Wright: What It Was Like (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 79.

Canadian music producer Wolfenstein OS X's album End of World Rave (2015) and the Antifur record label are credited with having first defined the hardvapour sound. It is also related to vaportrap. Beginnings On 29 November 2015, Canadian vaporwave producer Wolfenstein OS X released End of World Rave, the earliest notable hardvapour release, via the Bandcamp label Dream Catalogue. The album featured music that intentionally opposed aspects that were typically associated with the vaporwave sound. In December 2015, Wolfenstein OS X formed Antifur, a label responsible for many of the hardvapour records that have been issued; in running the label, he goes under the moniker of a Ukrainian with poor English named Vladyk Predovitch.Chandler, Simon (21 October 2016). \\"Antifur Want to Shake Vaporwave Out of Its Meaningless Irony\\". Retrieved 12 March 2017. Todd Ledford, founder of the label HVRF Central Command explained: On 9 December 2015, producer Hong Kong Express, under the alias Sandtimer, released Vaporwave Is Dead also under Dream Catalogue, which announced the \\"death\\" of vaporwave and a \\"new era.\\" The album features a spoken word track with the lyrics, ‚ÄúNow, in the beginnings of the end of the world, vaporwave is dead. From now on, it will only be‚Ä¶ the hardvapour.‚Äù Musical characteristics Common elements include thick synthesizer sounds, programmed drums, fast tempos, and influences of acid house, big beat, broken beat, gabber, speedcore, noise music, hard techno, industrial techno, hardstyle and drum 'n' bass.Arcand, Rob (12 July 2016). \\"Inside Hardvapour, an Aggressive, Wry Rebellion Against Vaporwave\\". THUMP. Vice Media. Retrieved 11 March 2017. The 56-track compilation album Hardvapour. by DJ VLAD, released worldwide via Antifur's Bandcamp page, showcases elements and influences from a variety of styles, such as techno, industrial music and trap. Hacking For Freedom by Wolfenstein OS X's pseudonym Flash Kostivich was characterised by journalist Matt Broomfield as a \\"unique sonic space somewhere between early Clicks and Cuts compilations and the Ghost in the Shell soundtrack.\\" Thump contributor Rob Arcand interprets the hardvapour sound as a rebellion against vaporwave that sometimes toys with elements of punk music. Examples such as \\"Humanoid Sound (–≥—É–º–∞–Ω–æ–∏–¥ –∑–≤—É–∫)\\" by Trende borrow the three-chord song structure of punk, while \\"Immortal\\" by DJ Alina features basslines distorted in a similar fashion to the works of Circle Jerks or Dead Kennedys. Arcand views hardvapour as somewhere between vaporwave and a genre journalist Adam Harper calls distroid, a style that was \\"hi-fi to the point of actively fetishizing the hi-frequency hisses and twinkles that lo-fi was unable to produce.\\" According to Arcand, in common with vaporwave, hardvapour uses similar music software tools \\"not out of any special fixation with them, but simply because they're now the cheapest and most accessible tools around.\\" Subcultural identity The hardvapour aesthetic is influenced by Eastern European culture and some of its producers are thought to be of Eastern European origin; the J-card of the Hardvapour. compilation album reveals that around a quarter of the producers included and involved were from Russia, Ukraine and Croatia. Other producers like Flash, DJ Alina, and Krokodil Hunter have falsely labeled themselves to be Ukrainian and Russian, which German critic Jens Balzer felt added a quirkiness to the hardvapour scene. Wolfenstein OS X has noted that one of the major goals of hardvapour was \\"globalization\\" and showcasing the true harsh cultures of not only Eastern European but also other nations. In contrasting the movement's identity to that of vaporwave Wolfenstein OS X stated: \\"The problem [of vaporwave] comes from the fact that it is all meaningless irony. We have sunk into this deep virtual plaza and have made a prison for ourselves made of softness. But this is not how the world is. If we want to change the world for better, we cannot escape into little fantasy world forever. Sometimes we must face the truth, and only the hard truth.\\" According to Matt Broomfield where vaporwave \\"exposes the artificiality below the utopic sheen of late capitalism\\" Hardvapour \\"throws post-apocalyptic raves in defiance of dystopia.\\"Broomfield, Matt (28 April 2016). \\"Inside ‚Äòhardvapour‚Äô, the internet‚Äôs latest microgenre\\". Dazed. Retrieved 11 March 2017. Thump writer Rob Arcand noted hardvapour's self-mocking aspect to be another major part of the culture with track titles such as \\"Long Live Hardvapour\\" and \\"Welcome to Hardvapour\\" that \\"either directly referencing the movement itself or obliquely mocking how the sound will be interpreted online (or eventually declared \\"over\\") though an endless proliferation of bizarre .gifs and nihilistic photos and videos.\\" Elements of cyberpunk also heavily come into play into the works of hardvapour and their visual aesthetic, such as on Hacking For Freedom whose iconography is inspired by the film The Matrix (1999) and the LPs Visions by Chinese Hackers and –ñ–æ—Ä—Å—Ç–∫–∏–π —â–æ–π–Ω–æ –≤–∏–ø–∞–≤ —Å–Ω—ñ–≥ by Bannik Krew that feature aspects of the frequent cyberpunk element of surveillance footage. According to Thumps Colin Joyce, \\"At the forefront of the genre is the absurdly prolific collective and label H.V.R.F. (short for Hardvapour Resistance Front). According to their Bandcamp, they're based in Pryp'Yat', Ukraine, a ghost town near the border the country shares with Belarus. It seems unlikely, however, that anyone associated with the collective is actually based there, given that the city was evacuated after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986.\\" Reception Hardvapour was called \\"exciting\\" by the publications THUMP, and the British magazine Dazed According to Dazed, hardvapour garnered criticism from many vaporwave listeners as an \\"over-worn in-joke\\" mainly due to the \\"arcane backstories\\" that conceptualised most releases of the style. Any discussion of hardvapour is banned from the official subreddit for vaporwave. Hong Kong Express responded to this banning: \\"Some people can't take things with humour in seriously for some reason. It‚Äôs closer to Dr. Strangelove ‚Äì a serious message with a dark and humorous slant.‚Äù According to Halzer, the use of false Eastern European identities by some producers have also garnered negative responses from many listeners; the listeners have deemed it as \\"cultural imperialist arrogance,\\" writing that the producers \\"mask themselves as people from poor, undemocratic, or even bourgeois-warped states, in order to be more interesting in this way.\\" As Wolfenstein OS X responded to these criticisms, \\"There were a lot of people who called what I did a mockery of those people, but I really wanted it to be the opposite‚Äîmaking it socially acceptable and almost aesthetically pleasing to experience this slang.\\" References 21st-century music genres Electronic music genres Vaporwave 2010s in music Indie music Microgenres ","title":"Hardvapour"},{"id":"53478660","text":"12 Bar Bruise is the debut studio album by Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard.

She was the first woman to cover a Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game (1973) and the first female journalist allowed into a baseball locker room (after the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Houston Astros at the Astrodome to win the pennant in 1974). Based in Houston for most of her career, Martini worked for radio and television stations in the city from the mid-1960s until shortly before her death. Early life Martini was born in Galveston, Texas, where her father was the owner of a theater. She was exposed to baseball as a young child; her uncle, Buck Fausett, was a professional baseball player, and she would often accompany him to ballparks. She was educated at Ursuline Academy, a local private school. Later, she attended Ball High School, the public high school in Galveston. For college, she went to Columbia, Missouri, where she studied for an associate degree in journalism from Stephens College. She got married and moved to Houston after that, but was soon divorced. Career By the 1960s, Martini worked for and then owned a Houston publication called FUN Magazine. Her broadcast career began in 1965, and she worked mostly for Houston stations, spending 14 years at KPRC Radio and also appearing on KPRC-TV, KHTV (Channel 39), and KULF Radio. She was the first woman in a major radio market to co- host a sports talk show (with Mike Edmonds on KPRC Radio, 1972-1979 and 1986-1991). For the first several years of Martini's career, no woman from the media had ever been admitted into a men's locker room in professional sports. At the Astrodome, women were also not allowed on the playing field or in the dining room. Late in the 1974 baseball season, after the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Houston Astros to win the National League pennant, Martini lined up with male reporters to enter the Dodgers locker room. Predictably, Martini was initially refused access. She asked to speak with Dodgers manager Walter Alston, and Alston allowed her to come into the locker room. Martini conducted interviews that day with Alston and with Dodgers players Steve Garvey and Jimmy Wynn. A lawsuit was later filed against MLB that established the rights of female reporters to enter baseball's locker rooms, but Martini was not involved in the suit. Martini had a long tenure in Houston, but in a 1975 interview with Sports Illustrated, she expressed disappointment at not getting a chance at a national broadcasting job: \\"What burns me is the networks are looking for women to accomplish something their men haven't done yet,\\" she says. \\"I'm not capable of doing a perfect game, but neither is any man.\\" In 1976, Martini interviewed with ABC to broadcast the station's backup game each week, but the network selected former MLB pitcher Bob Gibson. She asked some questions for a 1990 ESPN special, but she was not seen on camera. With her partner, Nelda Pe√±a, Martini ran a public relations firm that promoted both sports-related and non-sports-related entities. Death Martini was diagnosed with brain cancer and underwent brain surgery in April 1989. She experienced partial paralysis on one side of her body after the procedure, but she hosted a radio show from the hospital the day after her surgery. In a January 1990 article in The Galveston Daily News, she was described as \\"doing fine now.\\" Martini's health took a turn for the worse around May 1993, and she died of cancer in July of that year. She was inducted into the Texas Radio Hall of Fame in 2015.

She became one of the first woman physicians associated with a large public hospital in the United States, and she established one of the first nursing assistant training programs in the country. A graduate of Oberlin College and the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, Cleveland received postgraduate training in Philadelphia, Paris and London that was focused on obstetrics and gynecology and hospital administration. By 1872, she was the dean on the Woman's Medical College. Cleveland suffered from tuberculosis for the last several years of her life. Early life Cleveland was born Emeline Horton in Ashford, Connecticut, to Chauncey Horton and Amanda Chaffee Horton. Her paternal ancestors had been Puritans who came to the United States in the 1630s. Cleveland had eight siblings, six of them younger. When Cleveland was two years old, her family moved to a farm in Madison County, New York, where she received her schooling from tutors. Though Cleveland had aspirations of becoming a missionary that had started when she was a child, her father died when she was young, so she became a teacher in order to save enough money to attend college. In 1850, Cleveland enrolled at Oberlin College, graduating three years later. She had begun corresponding with Sarah Josepha Hale, who was the editor of a women's magazine known as Godey's Lady's Book. Hale was also secretary of a new organization known as the Pennsylvania Ladies' Missionary Society, and she told Cleveland about efforts at the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania (later known as the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania) to train women to serve as missionary physicians. Cleveland earned a medical degree after two years at the Female Medical College. While she was in medical school, Emeline had married a childhood friend of hers, Giles Butler Cleveland; he had gone to the Oberlin Theological Seminary to become a Presbyterian minister at the same time that she went off to Oberlin. The couple wanted to work as missionaries, but Giles became ill, eliminating the possibility of mission work. To support them, Emeline started a medical practice in Oneida Valley, New York. By late 1856, she was invited to teach anatomy courses at the Female Medical College of Philadelphia, so Cleveland and her husband moved back there. Career When the couple moved back to Philadelphia, Cleveland's husband was able to find a job as a teacher. A little over a year after their arrival, he became seriously ill again, and he was left partially paralyzed and out of work. Cleveland stayed at the Female Medical College until 1860 when physician colleague Ann Preston and several local Quaker women paid for Cleveland to go to Paris and London for further studies in obstetrics, gynecological surgery and hospital administration. Returning to Philadelphia in 1862, Cleveland became chief resident at the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, which Ann Preston had established while Cleveland was in Europe. The goal of the hospital was to provide patient care experience for medical students at the Woman's Medical College of Philadelphia, as they often faced discrimination in trying to gain clinical experiences at other hospitals. In 1872, Cleveland became the dean of the medical school when Preston died. Cleveland established training programs for nurses at the college, and she started one of the earliest programs to train nursing assistants. Her health was tenuous, and that forced her to step down as dean in 1874. In 1875, an article was published in a regional medical journal regarding Cleveland's performance of an ovariotomy in a patient who had been suffering from a cystic tumor of the ovary that had led to a large fluid collection within the abdomen.Peitzman, pp. 26-27. One of Cleveland's students wrote the journal article, making a concluding point that Cleveland's work was evidence that women could make good surgeons. Death In 1878, Cleveland was named a gynecologist for the Pennsylvania Hospital Department for the Insane, marking one of the first times that a woman had become a physician for a large public hospital. She died of tuberculosis later that year. She was buried next to Ann Preston at Fair Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. She was survived by her husband and by a son, Arthur Horton Cleveland, who became a physician. Cleveland's legacy was that of a physician who combined medical acumen with femininity and a down-to- earth demeanor. These factors may have helped her succeed in a male-dominated field because she was not seen as trying to upset the social order between men and women.Peitzman, pp. 27-28. Mary Corinna Putnam Jacobi, an influential physician who attended the Female Medical College in the 1860s, said that Cleveland was \\"a woman of real ability... personal beauty, and grace of manner.\\" Further reading * Notes * References 1829 births 1878 deaths People from Ashford, Connecticut 19th- century deaths from tuberculosis Oberlin College alumni Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania alumni Women surgeons People from Madison County, New York American surgeons 19th-century American women physicians 19th-century American physicians Burials in Pennsylvania ","title":"Emeline Horton Cleveland"},{"id":"53478794","text":"Glenea pujoli is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Once in America, he continued his education with a semester of language school, ditching plans to transfer to Environmental Design, and graduated in 1974 for a job in Detroit with General Motors. Consequently, due to Matano's work visa and the rising oil crisis, GM moved him to Australia to work for Holden Design alongside Phillip Zmood, mostly working on the GM Holden Torana, departing in 1977 for Germany and BMW in Munich, Germany. In 1983, Matano joined Mazda as Chief Designer for Mazda North American Operations, then moved up to become the Vice President of Design and eventually the Executive Vice President of Western Operations for Mazda R&D; North America, Inc., as well as the Executive Designer and Director of Mazda North American Operations. In his career with Mazda, his notable designs stand out in many vehicles, such as the Mazda RX-7, Mazda MX-5, the Miata \\"M-Coupe\\" concept car, and numerous other projects with his large group of design teams he created.

The attack on Nixon's car was called, at the time, the \\"most violent attack ever perpetrated on a high American official while on foreign soil\\". Close to being killed while a couple of his aides were injured in the melee, Nixon ended up unharmed and his entourage managed to reach the U.S. embassy. The visit took place only months after the overthrow of Venezuelan dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, who was awarded the Legion of Merit and later granted asylum by the United States, and the incident may have been orchestrated by the Communist Party of Venezuela. U.S. Navy Admiral Arleigh Burke mobilized fleet and Marine units to the region, compelling the Venezuelan government to provide full protection to Nixon for the remainder of the trip. The attack was denounced by all major Venezuelan presidential candidates standing in that year's election, except for the incumbent leader Admiral Wolfgang Larraz√°bal. Nixon was generally applauded in American press reports for his calm and adept handling of the incident and was feted with a \\"hero's welcome\\" on his return to the United States. His recollections of the attack form one of the \\"six crises\\" explored in his Six Crises book. Context Richard Nixon's carefully planned 1958 tour of South America has been described as one of the \\"most important United States foreign policy events in post-WWII Latin America\\". It was undertaken at a time of confused United States intra-hemispheric relations; the role of Latin American states in the emerging American grand strategy of containment was unclear and ill- defined. However, a recent worldwide drop in commodity prices that badly affected South American economies, coupled with increasing Soviet overtures in the western hemisphere, made President of the United States Dwight Eisenhower determine that a tour by a major United States functionary was necessary to demonstrate U.S. commitment to the region. Nixon retrospectively wrote that he was uninterested in taking the trip. The tour was to see Nixon visit every independent country in South America except Brazil and Chile. Brazil had been omitted from the itinerary as Nixon had visited that nation the previous year. The Chilean leadership, meanwhile, were scheduled to be out-of-the-country during the time period of Nixon's visit. Nixon was accompanied on his trip by his wife, Pat Nixon. =Early tour stops= mate at the Montevideo home of former Uruguayan president Luis Batlle Berres. Nixon began his tour in Uruguay, arriving at Carrasco International Airport at 9:00 a.m. on April 28. There, he was greeted by senior Uruguayan officials. According to an Associated Press report at the time, about 40 students protested on the street corner as Nixon's motorcade proceeded into Montevideo. In Montevideo, Nixon made an unscheduled appearance at the University of the Republic and was generally well received by students. According to Nixon, he decided to make the unannounced stop because he felt that average Uruguayans would be receptive towards him, while scheduled and published visits were likely to attract organized demonstrations. This proved to be the case, and when communists arrived and tried to distribute literature, the students tore up the pamphlets. The visit to Argentina was billed as the major stop of the trip and four days were allotted to the country, instead of the two slated for the other visits. In Buenos Aires, Nixon attended the presidential inauguration of Arturo Frondizi and spoke to several student and organized labor groups. The first serious trouble on the tour materialized in Lima, Peru. Nixon's scheduled appearance at the University of San Marcos saw a large crowd of student demonstrators awaiting his arrival. In an event foreshadowing his famous visit to the Lincoln Memorial to meet anti-war protesters some years later, Nixon waded directly into the crowd of demonstrators, attended by only two staff members. Over the next few minutes Nixon spoke with the students, however, a second faction of demonstrators soon began stoning the group, hitting one of Nixon's staff in the mouth and grazing the vice-president's neck. The vice-president then withdrew and a later round-table with student leaders was canceled. Returning to his hotel, Nixon and his staff had to push through demonstrators who had encamped outside, during which Nixon was struck in the face. Eisenhower cabled Nixon at his next stop, in Quito, Ecuador: Nixon, pictured here in Bogot√° in 1958, was well-received during his stop in Colombia Nixon's final stop before Venezuela and Colombia saw generally receptive crowds. At Bol√≠var Square in Bogot√°, he laid a wreath at the statue of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var before a crowd of about 1,000. An Associated Press report noted that there were some hecklers in the audience, but they amounted to \\"about 80 youths\\" and observed that \\"generally ... the Colombian crowds were friendly or enthusiastic\\". Tour in Venezuela = Background = Earlier in 1958, the disliked Venezuelan dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez had been overthrown in a popular uprising and had gone into exile in the United States. A military junta formed a caretaker government to rule the country until new elections could be held. Admiral Wolfgang Larraz√°bal, head of the governing junta, had announced his intention to stand in those elections; his candidacy was backed by a coalition of parties, including the Venezuelan Communist Party. The United States' decision to grant P√©rez Jim√©nez asylum and to award him the Legion of Merit on 12 November 1954 combined to create a charged atmosphere leading up to Nixon's arrival. The Caracas municipal council even passed a resolution effectively declaring Nixon persona non grata. Prior to Nixon's arrival in Caracas, media reported on rumors that an attempt had been planned on the vice-president's life during his visit. The CIA station chief in Venezuela, meanwhile, urged that this leg of the trip be canceled. In an interview conducted after he retired from government service, Robert Amerson, then-press attache to the United States embassy in Venezuela, claims that the demonstrators who disrupted the Venezuela stop on the tour \\"had been bused down by the professional agitators and organizers\\" affiliated with the Communist Party of Venezuela. This view was one echoed in a report issued by William P. Snow, acting Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, who wrote that \\"the pattern of organization and of slogans in all cases points to Communist inspiration and direction, as do certain of the intelligence reports\\". Nixon, himself, also blamed Communist instigation. A Universal Newsreel at the time characterized it as \\"another of the well- planned campaigns of harassment\\" and a \\"communist-sparked onslaught\\". Venezuelan journalist Carlos Rangel has indicated the \\"Nixon carnival\\" was organized by the Venezuelan Communist Party as a way of demonstrating that it had the ability to \\"dominate the streets, that the Caracas masses were ready to be mobilized\\". = Arrival = Nixon, left, with Wolfgang Larraz√°bal, center Nixon arrived, via air, in Caracas on May 13, 1958. According to a U.S. Secret Service report of the incident, a crowd of demonstrators at the airport \\"purposely disrupted ... [the] welcoming ceremony by shouting, blowing whistles, waving derogatory placards, throwing stones, and showering the Nixons with human spittle and chewing tobacco\\". Reporting for the New York Herald Tribune, Earl Mazo wrote that \\"Venezuelan troops and police seemed to evaporate. The vice-president and the whole official party literally had to fight their way to cars behind a thin but sturdy phalanx of U.S. Secret Service agents\\". Admiral Wolfgang Larraz√°bal, leader of the ruling junta, was reportedly concerned heavy-handed policing would alienate his base The original itinerary had Nixon moving from the airport to the National Pantheon of Venezuela where he was to lay a wreath at the tomb of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. However, a United States naval attache sent ahead with the wreath reported a crowd that had assembled at the Pantheon had attacked him and torn up the wreath. At this point it was decided to proceed directly to the U.S. embassy. = Attack = For the first time on the South America tour, the Nixons traveled in closed-top cars, as opposed to convertibles, a decision later credited with saving their lives. As the Nixons traveled by motorcade through Caracas, the vehicle carrying the Vice-President was slowed to a crawl by heavy traffic. A crowd used the stoppage to throng Nixon's vehicle, stoning it and banging the windows with their fists. Nixon was protected by twelve United States Secret Service agents, some of whom were injured in the melee. According to the Secret Service, Venezuelan police declined to intervene to clear the crowd. When the mob began rocking the car back and forth in an attempt to overturn it, U.S. Secret Service agents, believing the vice- president's life was in jeopardy, drew their firearms and prepared to begin shooting into the crowd. In an act described as \\"the kind of presence of mind for which battlefield commanders win medals\\", Nixon ordered Secret Service agent-in-charge Jack Sherwood to hold fire and shoot only on his orders; no shots were ultimately fired. Nixon would later recount that Venezuelan Foreign Minister √ìscar Garc√≠a Velutini, who was traveling with him, was \\"close to hysterics\\" and kept repeating \\"this is terrible, this is terrible\\". According to Nixon, Velutini explained the police inaction was because the communists \\"helped us overthrow P√©rez Jim√©nez and we are trying to find a way to work with them\\". Nixon's longtime secretary, Rose Mary Woods, was injured by flying glass when the windows of the car in which she was riding, following Nixon, were smashed. Vernon Walters, then a mid-ranking U.S. Army officer serving as Nixon's translator, would end up with a \\"mouthful of glass\\", and Velutini was also hit by shards of the limousine's supposedly \\"shatter-proof\\" glass. Nixon's car, even though it was equipped with shatter-proof glass, was unable to withstand the pummeling it received from the crowd Two different accounts explain how Nixon's car was ultimately able to escape the mob and continue to the embassy. According to one version of events, the U.S. press corps' flatbed truck, accompanying the motorcade, was used to clear a path through the crowd. In Nixon's remembrance of the incident, Associated Press photographer Hank Griffin at one point had to use his camera to beat back a protester who tried to mount the truck. According to a second account, soldiers of the Venezuelan Army arrived and cleared the traffic, thereafter moving the mob back at bayonet-point to allow Nixon's car to pass. = Embassy = Shortly after the Nixons arrived at the embassy, the Venezuelan army surrounded and fortified the chancellery, reinforcing the small U.S. Marine guard force. Their assistance had earlier been requested by the U.S. ambassador. That afternoon, members of the ruling junta arrived at the embassy and lunched with Nixon. The next morning, representatives of Venezuela's major labor unions came to the embassy and requested an audience with Nixon, which was granted. The union leaders apologized for events of the preceding day and disclaimed involvement, though, United States Air Force officer Manuel Chavez ‚Äì at the time attached to the embassy ‚Äì wrote in 2015 that \\"they probably were the instigators or at least encouraged the actions\\". = U.S. mobilization = Upon learning of the incident, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke ordered the airlift of elements of the 2nd Marine Division and the 101st Airborne Division to staging areas in Puerto Rico and Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. The aircraft carrier , along with eight destroyers and two amphibious assault ships, were ordered to put to sea towards Venezuela. The U.S. mobilization was code-named \\"Operation Poor Richard\\". A fleet of 12 ships centered on , pictured here in 1952, was ordered to Venezuela once news of the attack on Nixon reached Washington According to U.S. officials at the time, the forces mobilized were being readied to enter Venezuela to \\"cooperate with the Venezuelan government\\", though later accounts suggest President Eisenhower was preparing to \\"invade Venezuela\\" should Nixon suffer further indignity. Privately, Eisenhower was reportedly furious at the attack on Nixon and, at one point, told his staff \\"I am about ready to go put my uniform on\\". Nixon was shocked after learning about the mobilization and wondered why they were not consulted, but later found out that communications between Caracas and Washington had been cut for a critical period immediately after the riot that afternoon. In response to the movement of American military forces into the region, Admiral Larraz√°bal pledged the Nixon party would be \\"protected fully\\" thereafter. =Return to the United States= Additional activities were canceled, and Nixon departed Caracas the next morning, seven hours early. His motorcade to the airport was protected by a major deployment of Venezuelan Army infantry and armored forces in the capital. Nixon described having taken the same route as before, whose streets were empty and heavily patrolled after the whole area had been tear- gassed. American reaction Eisenhower ordered that Nixon should receive a \\"hero's welcome\\" on his return; all U.S. government employees in Washington, D.C. were given the day off work to turn-out for the arrival of the vice- president. Nixon deplaned before \\"a cheering crowd of 10,000\\" that included the congressional leadership and ambassadors from most Latin American countries. Eisenhower personally greeted Nixon at the airport and the two then traveled to the White House along a route lined by 100,000 people. Life credited Nixon for his \\"courage\\" and said \\"his coolness had been remarkable\\". According to Path√© News, Nixon reflected \\"calm, rather than concern.\\" For weeks after the attack, Nixon received standing ovations \\"wherever he went ... a new high in his life\\". By contrast, The New Republic claimed the attack was a hoax set up to help Nixon's chances in the 1960 U.S. presidential election. All twelve agents of Nixon's Secret Service detail received the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service from Eisenhower at Nixon's request. Venezuelan reaction R√≥mulo Betancourt greets Larraz√°bal after taking oath in the National Congress John F. Kennedy visit to Venezuela with R√≥mulo Betancourt In Venezuela, all major presidential candidates standing in the 1958 general election denounced the attack except for the incumbent president, Admiral Larraz√°bal. After Nixon's departure, Larraz√°bal said that he would have joined the protests if he were a student. Although receiving strong backing by the communists, Larraz√°bal lost the election to R√≥mulo Betancourt. During the 1961 visit of U.S. President John F. Kennedy to Venezuela, anti- American violence also broke out, however, a repeat of the 1958 attack was avoided. President Betancourt pre-deployed significant Venezuelan military forces into Caracas in advance of Kennedy's arrival and ordered the preventive arrest of suspected ringleaders. All ten miles of the highway Kennedy was scheduled to travel from the airport, the same highway traveled by Nixon, were closed effective the day before Kennedy's arrival. A 2013 editorial on the attack published by the Bolivarian radio station Alba Ciudad disputed the characterization of the incident, explaining that, \\"no one forced him [Nixon] to stay on Venezuelan soil, no one had him abducted, no one was blocking him or holding him in the country. To the contrary, people asked him to leave!\\" Significance Path√© News, at the time, described the assault as \\"the most violent attack ever perpetrated on a high American official while on foreign soil\\". Nixon, pictured here 14 years after the attack, was deeply affected by his experiences in Caracas Various sources describe the attack as one that nearly led to Nixon's death and, though it is generally agreed he acted with remarkable composure throughout, the incident had a lasting impact on him. In his first book, Six Crises, Nixon wrote of the experience as one of the titular crises with great impact on his life. Every year on the anniversary of the attack, Nixon would \\"privately celebrate\\" with Vernon Walters. Nixon would favor Walters for the rest of his career, eventually appointing him Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. On the eve of Walters' retirement from government service, in 1991, Nixon explained his longtime patronage of the general, writing him that \\"you and I have faced death together and that gives us a special bond\\". The hardening of Nixon's attitude toward Latin America, which he came to \\"equate with violence and irrationality\\", has been attributed to his experience of the attack. Some believe this change of mood foreshadowed his subsequent support for covert U.S. actions directed in support of dictatorial regimes in the region. In fact, he would later privately list several nations whose populations, he believed, were too immature for democratic government and would be better administered by authoritarian regimes, specifically citing France, Italy, and all of Latin America \\"except for Colombia\\". The incident has been credited with first making American policymakers aware of growing popular resentment to U.S. policies in Latin America. By the end of 1958, the U.S. National Security Council would list \\"yankeephobia\\" as a key challenge to U.S. interests in Latin America.

He was named the Brazilian Horse of the Year of 2013/2014, having won all eight starts that year with several track records to his credit. In July 2014, he was sold to new owners and shipped to America but came down with a life- threatening bout of laminitis. After intensive treatment, he was finally able to return to the race track a year later, with mixed results. Late in 2016, he was sold again, this time to Calumet Farm for use as a breeding stallion. However, his trainer Richard Mandella convinced the owners to keep the horse active for another year and Bal a Bali responded by winning the Frank E. Kilroe Mile and Shoemaker Mile Stakes. He is the second survivor of laminitis to return and win a Grade I race (the first being Lady Eli in the 2016 Flower Bowl), marking significant progress in the treatment of the disease. Background Bal a Bali is a dark bay stallion who was bred by Haras Santa Maria de Araras, which is owned by Brazilian banker Julio Bozano. Bal a Bali is sired by Put It Back, a stakes winning son of Honour and Glory. Put It Back became a leading sire in Florida and also has sired multiple winners in Brazil where Bozano had arranged for him to stand during the southern hemisphere's breeding season. As a descendant of the relatively rare In Reality sire line that traces back through Man o' War to the Godolphin Arabian, Put It Back is an outcross for most mares. Bal a Bali is out of the stakes-winning mare In My Side, who was bought by Bozano at a dispersal sale in Brazil. The resulting foal, named Bal a Bali by Bozano's wife, was a well-built colt who was calm and easy to handle. He was sold as a yearling to Alvaro Novis, a successful Brazilian businessman. He was originally trained by Dulcino Guignoni, who had previously trained Brazilian Triple Crown winners Virginie (1998) and Be Fair (2000). Racing career At age two, Bal a Bali won three of four races, all held at the Hip√≥dromo da G√°vea in Rio de Janeiro. He won his debut on February 2, 2013, raced at a distance of 1000m (about 5 furlongs), by lengths. He followed up with wins in the Classico Jose Calmon on March 2 and the Group III Mario de Azevedo Ribeiro on March 31 before suffering his first loss in the Group II Conde de Herzberg on May 26. =2013/2014: three-year-old season= Bal a Bali started his three-year-old campaign on September 14, 2013 in the Leiloes Jockey Club Brasileiro - Versao Potros, run at a distance of 1600m (about 1 mile), and won by lengths in a time of 1:33.37 on soft turf. He next won the Ernani De Freitas on October 26 and the Group III Julio Capua on December 1. On January 12, he won his first Group I race, the Estado do Rio de Janeiro, which is the first leg of the Brazilian Triple Crown. His time of 1:31.36 for the 1600m was not only a track record, it was also one of the fastest times ever run at the distance. On February 16, Bal a Bali returned to win the second leg of the Triple Crown, the Francisco Eduardo de Paula Machado, in a time of 1:59.25 for the distance of 2,000m. He then completed the Triple Crown by winning the Grande Premio Cruzeiro do Sul on March 16. His time of 2:23.25 for the distance of 2,400m (about 12 furlongs) was a new track record. Bal a Bali rounded out his three-year-old season with wins in the Group II Doutor Frontin on May 11 and the Group I Grande Pr√™mio Brasil on June 8. The latter victory gave Bal a Bali an automatic berth in the Breeders' Cup Turf as part of the Breeders' Cup Challenge \\"Win and You're In\\" series. Bal a Bali was named the Brazilian Champion Three-Year-Old Colt and Horse of the Year of 2013/2014. =Laminitis= In July 2014, Bal a Bali was sold for $1.5 million to Fox Hill Farm, owned by Rick Porter, and Siena Farm. He was shipped to a quarantine facility in Miami and arrived with a scrape on his hind leg. A veterinarian was called in and detected signs of impending laminitis, a hoof condition that causes serious pain and is a leading cause of death in horses. The horse was quickly moved to Palm Beach Equine Clinic, where early and aggressive action proved to be the key to the horse's survival. Dr Vernon Dryden of Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital said that Bal a Bali had full-blown laminitis: the coffin bone was displaced and had rotated down and away from the wall of the hoof. Treatments included use of a cold water spa (cryotherapy) and injection of several doses of stem cells into the bone marrow. Bal a Bali developed a large abscess on his foot that Dryden opened and then treated with sterile maggots to prevent sepsis. Bal a Bali also had issues with his kidneys and dorsal colitis that required further care. \\"He had a gamut of issues and was a pretty sick boy for a while,\\" said Dryden. \\"He was definitely a lucky guy to get through it.\\" By September, Bal a Bali had recovered enough to be sent from Miami to Siena Farm in Kentucky. His handlers continued with the spa treatment and were soon able to turn the horse out for brief periods to forage for grass. A vibration plate was also used to help restore circulation in the hoof. Over the next months, his handlers gradually increased the amount of exercise to build up muscle while regrowing the hoof. He was first put on a walker, then had weight added, then finally started light jogging on a nearby training track. =2015: five-year-old season= Bal a Bali finally returned to the racetrack on May 9, 2015 after an absence of nearly 11 months in the Grade III American Stakes at Santa Anita. Racing behind the early pace, Bal a Bali squeezed between horses to find racing room in the stretch, then drew off to win by a length from Talco. \\"He has worked so good in the mornings, so I was pretty confident,\\" said jockey Flavien Prat. \\"He just repeated his works today. I wasn't really surprised. He was the champion in Brazil, so he can be the champion here. Why not?\\" Bal a Bali made his next start on June 15 in the Grade I Shoemaker Mile, where he was moving well around the turn and looked like a possible winner. However, he flattened in the stretch and finished fifth behind Talco. Mandella subsequently detected a small bone chip in one of his ankles, but the condition was not serious. Bal a Bali returned on August 23 in the Del Mar Handicap, where he finished eighth. On October 30, Mandella entered him in an allowance optional claiming race at Del Mar, and Bal a Bali responded with a -length victory. He completed the year by finishing second to Midnight Storm in the Seabiscuit Handicap. =2016: six-year-old season= Bal a Bali had a disappointing six-year-old campaign, going winless in five starts. He finished third in the San Gabriel Stakes on January 2, 2016, third in the Frank E. Kilroe Mile on March 12 and third again in the San Francisco Mile on April 30. On May 29, he finished fourth in the Charles Whittingham Stakes and then finished eighth in the Gold Cup at Santa Anita on June 25 in his first start on the dirt. =2017: seven- year-old season= Bal a Bali was originally scheduled to retire to stud at Calumet Farm in 2017 but Mandella had other ideas. \\"I gave him some time off, and they thought, if he didn't train well, he could go to stud,\\" Mandella said. \\"But he's training too good to go to stud.\\" Instead, Bal a Bali was entered in the Group I Frank E. Kilroe Mile on March 11, 2017 where he was the 9-1 longshot in a highly competitive field of six. Bal a Bali raced in the middle of the pack during the early going, then gradually closed ground in the stretch to win by a head over What a View, who had won the 2016 renewal of the race. Bal a Bali became one of the first horses to come back from laminitis and win a Grade I race. Bal a Bali finished fifth in his next start, the Woodford Reserve Turf Classic on a rain-softened course at Churchill Downs on May 6. On June 3, he returned to win the Shoemaker Mile at Santa Anita with a powerful closing run. \\"He's had some problems in his life and overcame them,\\" said Mandella. \\"He's very fortunate to have had two sets of owners that are the best in the business and were willing to do what's right for him, and the results of that are what we saw today.\\" On August 20, Bal a Bali made what would prove to be his final start in the Del Mar Mile Handicap, finishing sixth. He was next being pointed to the Breeders' Cup Mile but Mandella felt he was not training at a high enough level so the decision was made to retire him. \\"He's had problems ever since he came here and he's dealt with them and had success ‚Äì success beyond expectations\\", said Mandella. Retirement Bal a Bali was retired to stud at Calumet Farm, where he stood his first season in 2018 for a fee of $15,000. His first foals will be of racing age in 2021. Pedigree Bal a Bali is inbred 4 √ó 4 to the mare Gonfalon, meaning she appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

She later moved with two children to San Diego, California where she worked as a cook and a housekeeper. In 1961, Canty moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1972 she took as a job as a maid at Thunderbird Hotel. After her husband‚Äôs death in 1975, she was left to support eight children on her own income. Canty found work first as a janitor at Clark County School District and later as a maid in private homes. Eventually, she found work at Maxim Hotel and Casino (later the Westin Las Vegas), which provided her and her children with access to health insurance. Labor organizing in Las Vegas It was during her employment at Maxim Hotel that she became involved in the union movement. She joined the Las Vegas Hotel and Culinary Workers Union Local 226 and was elected to their executive board. In 1984, Canty was part of planning a walkout strike of Las Vegas casino workers who demanded improved conditions and insurance benefits. The strike lasted for 75 days. In 1990, she was elected president of the Las Vegas Hotel and Culinary Workers Union Local 226. As president, she led a number of publicized strikes In 1991, Canty led a strike of 550 culinary workers from New Frontier Hotel and Gambling Hall in protest of unfair labor conditions. The strike was the longest labor strike in American History and lasted for six and a half years. See Canty's interview with Claytee D. White in 1998 about picketing for employment rights. Canty helped to found the Culinary Training Academy of Las Vegas in 1993. The Academy is still in operation and trains several thousand people every year for work in the hospitality industry. Their mission is ‚Äúto reduce poverty and eliminate unemployment by providing employability and vocational skills to youth, adults, and displaced workers.‚Äù Its founding has been noted as one of Canty‚Äôs crowning achievements. Hattie Canty is known for her work fighting for a living wage as well as her advocacy for minority involvement in the labor movement and workforce advancement. She organized a diverse labor union of workers from 84 different countries. Canty made the observation that ‚Äúcoming from Alabama, this seemed like the civil rights struggle‚Ä¶the labor movement and the civil rights movement, you cannot separate the two of them.\\" Hattie Canty died in Las Vegas in 2012.

Byzantine glass objects highly resembled their earlier Roman counterparts during the fourth and early fifth centuries CE in both form and function. Over the course of the fifth century CE, Byzantine glass blowers, based mostly in the area of Syria and Palestine, developed a distinct Byzantine style. While glass vessels continued to serve as the primary vehicles for pouring and drinking liquid, glassware for lighting, currency and commodity weights, window panes, and glass tesserae for mosaics and enamels also surged in popularity. Following the Arab conquests of the seventh century CE, large quantities of glass were imported from the Levant, which continued to produce raw and manufactured glass.Jenkins, Marylin, \\"Islamic Glass: A Brief History,\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series Vol.44 No.2 (Autumn 1986), 6. Scholars once believed that glassware was an expensive luxury good reserved for the upper strata of society, however, recent archaeological excavations have unearthed a considerable quantity of unadorned glassware intended for lower-class residents.Lightfoot, Christopher, \\"Glass Finds at Amorium,\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers, Vol.59 (2005), 175. Production Chemical analyses of Byzantine glassware have demonstrated that Byzantine glass was composed of the same basic materials as Roman glass‚Äîcombining sand-derived silica, a fluxing agent, and lime, as well as various coloring agents. Roman and Byzantine glass-making was divided into two phases. The first, called \\"primary glass- making\\" involved the conversion of sand and stabilizer into raw glass. Separate workshops would then re-heat the glass and shape it into an object, in a phase referred to as \\"secondary glass-making\\". Although there is considerable archaeological evidence establishing primary glass-making sites, secondary glass-making sites remain difficult to pinpoint. The largest number of glass production sites from the Early Byzantine period have been unearthed in Syria and Palestine, as well as Egypt. Glass factories have also been discovered in Greece (Corinth, Thessoloniki) and Asia Minor.Antonaras, Anastassios, \\"The Production and Uses of Glass in Byzantine Thessaloniki,\\" in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 189-198. A chemical analysis of sixth-century Byzantine glass weights demonstrated that glass was also manufactured in Carthage and along the Danube River.Schibille, Nadine, Meek, Andrew, Benguez, Tobias, Entwistle, Chris, Avisseau-Broustet Mathilde, Da Mota, Henrique, Gratuze, Bernard, \\"Comprehensive Chemical Characterization of Byzantine Glass Weights,\\" PLoS One Vol.11, no.12 (Dec.2016). e0168289. Literary sources refer to glass-making sites in Constantinople, Emesa (Homs, Syria), and various Egyptian towns. Labor Though some towns were home to glass-maker guilds, most Byzantine glass-makers were independent entrepreneurs. Glass-workers could be either male or female. An extant glass-making contract from Armenia mentions a woman glass manufacturer.Stern, E. Marianne, \\"Glass Producers in Late Antique and Byzantine Papyri,\\" in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 84-85. Glass-making styles and techniques by object Glass vessel shapes in the Byzantine period did not deviate greatly from those of the high Roman period. Beginning in the late fifth century, glassblowers in the near east produced increasingly larger vessels. They also introduced the folded, stemmed foot. In the sixth and seventh centuries Byzantine glass vessels typically features a delicate u-shaped mouth. A number of \\"classical\\" Roman glassware shapes were phased out by the fifth century including: bowls, flat- bottomed cups and beakers, and footed wine jugs featuring trefoil mouths.Stern, E. Marianne, Roman Byzantine, and Early Medieval Glass 10 BCE-700 CE : Ernesto Wolf Collection, (Ostfildern-Ruit: Haje Cantz,2001), 261-263. A major innovation of the Byzantine period was the invention of the glass lamp. Glass lamps are first attested in the first half of the fourth century CE in Palestine, where they began to replace the clay lamps in use at the time as they were much more efficient. By the middle of the fifth century their use was rapidly spreading westward. Initially these lamps were shaped just like drinking vessels, though the number of shapes expanded to seventeen over the course of the sixth and seventh centuries.Stern, E. Marianne, Roman Byzantine, and Early Medieval Glass 10 BCE-700 CE : Ernesto Wolf Collection, (Ostfildern- Ruit: Haje Cantz,2001), 262. Following the \\"Triumph of Orthodoxy\\" in 843 CE, enamel relief icons became the predominant form of iconography in Byzantium.Pentcheva, Bissera V. \\"The Performative Icon, \\" The Art Bulletin, vol.88 no.4 (Dec.2006), 631-632. The best-known example is the Michael the Archangel enamel from the treasury of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. Silver staining Byzantine glass silver-stained bracelet, dated 1100‚Äì1400, on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Similar bracelets have been found throughout the Byzantine empire.Pilosi, Lisa, Whitehouse, David, \\"Early Islamic and Byzantine Silver Stain,\\" in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 334. In the middle Byzantine period, Byzantine glass-makers adopted silver-staining techniques from the Arab world. Silver-stained glass is created by applying a metallic compound, mixed with a \\"carrier\\" of clay or ochre to the surface of the glass object, then the glass is fired below the softening point of the glass. This process results in the breakdown of the smeared compound and its transition into the body of the glass object, creating a \\"stained\\" effect. Depending on the makeup of the compound and the \\"carrier\\" this process can lead to a wide array of colors. While the Arabs began creating silver-stained glass objects in the late eighth century in Egypt, the first Byzantine silver- stained object has been dated to the ninth century. The most common items featuring Byzantine silver-stain are simple glass bracelets, dating from the tenth to thirteenth centuries, and being discovered across the Byzantine world, from Greece to Anatolia. The most famous example of Byzantine silver- staining is the interior inscription of the beautiful San Marco bowl, dated to the \\"Macedonian Renaissance\\" of the tenth century. Several fragments of silver-stained window glass have been discovered. Although silver staining was practiced by the Byzantines, silver-stained works were not as ubiquitous in Byzantium as they were to become in late Medieval Europe. However, the widespread use of silver-staining in Byzantium could in part explain the transmission of silver-stain technique from the Arab world to Western Europe.Pilosi, Lisa, Whitehouse, David, \\"Early Islamic and Byzantine Silver Stain,\\" in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 329-337.

He received an athletic scholarship to play college football at Simon Fraser University. Amer played a variety of positions with Simon Fraser, including quarterback, running back, and slotback.  Professional career  Prior to the 1981 CFL Draft, the Toronto Argonauts considered designating Amer as their territorial exemption pick. This didn't occur, and Amer was later drafted in the third round of the 1982 CFL Draft by the Calgary Stampeders with the 21st overall pick. The Stampeders initially released Amer prior to the season opener, but he later returned and played in five regular season games in the 1982 season as a tight end. Amer caught two passes for 37 yards with the Stampeders.

He was appointed to join the laboratory of Frederick Soddy, however due to the circumstance of Soddy he studied in the laboratory with Charles Heycock for a while, who was the chemist in the Cambridge University. He joined to work in the laboratory of Frederick Soddy from October 1920 until June 1921, in which his study was focused on the radiochemistry. After returning to Japan, he led his own laboratory as the chief researcher of RIKEN. Along with working for the research of radiochemistry, the laboratory conducted the research of analytical chemistry, mineralogical chemistry, photochemistry, geochemistry especially of rare elements, luminescence of minerals and ceramics as well. During the World War II he worked for the search of uranium containing ore in the project \\"Ni-Goh Kenkyu(Project NIGO)\\" as his major research was mainly focused on radiochemical minerals. After the war the research of radiochemistry was prohibited by US authority, he started to develop in the field of ceramic materials and retired from RIKEN in 1952.

The sounds to be synchronized could be from the words of a narrator, the reading of a score by an orchestra conductor (or by a musician soloist), or shooting up devices with noises-effects;. But always by mechanical procedures, and with live sound by interpreters in the room (it was still a decade away for sound cinema). It was also known as Cin√©-desk (Cin√©-pupitre) in certain countries. But in reality, under the same name are called, over time, three different things: A) Firstly, the original synchronized reading desk, 1921, namely, an isolated device for reading texts or music, for a single user (although this may be an orchestra conductor who, since reading it, controls the complete template of instrumentalists) adjusted by an engine in synchronization with the projected images of the films. B) Soon after, in 1922-23, the synchro-cin√© is now becoming a complete synchronization system, in which the reading desk is only one of the many elements around another central device, the control band, which can automatically trigger various 'noise' devices (Cin√©-bruiteurs) or 'noise-makers' (also designed and incorporated into the system in the patent), shoot piano players, gramophones, and various desks that are needed, up to a maximum of, it seems, 9 devices. The proof of the change of orientation in the machinery and final objectives is the fact that, although the reading desks remain a regular part of the system; however it is already perfectly possible to perform a performance without using, at all, the reading desks (only with the capacity of the central distributor, and the connected sound devices). They also form part of the system the various procedures and methods that it registers to improve and facilitate the use of its synchronization system (the Delacommune system), over time. And c) later, it gave name to a production and distribution company of the films realized with this device (and directed by the own Delacommune). Among others, \\"ElDorado\\", by L'Herbier; the \\"Danse Macabre\\" by Dudley Murphy or the Ballet m√©canique, by L√©ger. With a trajectory based on documentaries, this production company had a moment of boom at the beginning of sound cinema. as this procedure and device proved to be very suitable for the synchronization of voices in dubbing (the so-called 'band rhythm'), and used until very recently by the professionals of said specialty. However, Delacommune (and his company) it ended up falling into ruin and had to be subject to a special campaign of help by his fellow inventors for their mere subsistence.  The first audiovisual mixer  link=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Delacommune_synchronized_control_system_at_full_capacity.jpg The original 1921 device consisted of a reading device supplied with an aperture at which a paper text \\"that unfolded before the reader, by small shakes, on which was inscribed the oral accompaniment of the film. Each line corresponded to the projection time of a number of determined [s] and was in the center of the reference during the projection of these frames. In other words, the fixed reference allowed the reader to know in each instant the phrase of the text to say corresponding to the projection or the conductor of the appropriate musical fragment\\", say Delacommune himself in his patent. Once the paper-band was prepared, the various mismatches common to the time from multiple causes (lack of electrical current, mechanical problems, etc.) could be solved, on the fly, in two ways. Or the speed of the control band was set at the desk ( or the distributor) or by a mechanism that the orchestra conductor was placed in the hand, slightly vary the speed of the images. But this system also had the potential to work in another way: firing directly from its paper-band orders to the various notes of a pianola, or shooting up effects and devices of noises or records previously prepared for this purpose. It is this potentiality of automatic adjustment (once the control-band is properly recorded) that makes it a mechanical precedent to the current audiovisual mixes tables,and, perhaps, of the MIDI systems ( the digital control of musical instruments). It was not the only device of the so-called synchronization desks or synchronized reading of the time, an advance that the film industry of the moment was looking forward to, as it offered movies with live music, including large symphony orchestras in the first class halls (Cinema-Palaces) or Theater-Cinemas. Delacommune himself says in the magazines of the time: \\"One immediately understands the interest of such an apparatus. Of a little expensive manufacture, with a safe operation, its use is very indicated in all the places where the words must accompany a projection. One can foresee the happy consequences in teaching, in filmed lectures, in innovations (theater-filmed, novel-movies spoken, et cetera). Shortly after, the German industry counted with the Musikchronometer, of Carl Blum for the same thing, an analog device although with different mechanism, and which was used with satisfaction by the participants (among them, Hindemith) in the Darmstad Music encounters since 1927.

The museum is located close to Turku Cathedral in the historical city centre of Turku on the southwest coast of Finland. It is the only museum devoted to music in Finland. The museum houses a wide collection of historical music instruments from around the world. The archives of the museum include documents (sheet music, manuscripts, recordings, photographs, concert programmes, etc.) The museum was first founded during the 1920s as a seminar for the Department of Musicology at √Öbo Akademi University, and has later developed into its own department. The Museum is currently organised and funded by the √Öbo Akademi Foundation. The current building was built and opened in 1968 and it was designed by architect Woldemar Baeckman.  General information  The museum consists of two primary exhibitions: the instrument collection and the Sibelius exhibition. The instrument collections circles around the concert hall of the museum, The Sibelius Hall, and continues to the second floor downstairs. The Sibelius exhibition is located at the furthest left corner seen from the ticket counter. The museum also organises thematic exhibitions. In 2018, these exhibitions are \\"Sibbe50\\" and \\"A cantata for the doctors ‚Äì Music at academic ceremonies\\". \\"¬¥Sibbe50\\" celebrates the architecture of Woldemar Baeckman and the 50th anniversary of the current museum building. The exhibition \\"A cantata for the doctors ‚Äì Music at academic\\" ceremonies covers music performed at conferment ceremonies in Finnish universities. The Sibelius Museum also organises concerts at the museum, of which the most notable is the museum's own concert series, the Wednesday series that has been organised since 1968. In addition to these concerts, there are also other concerts organised at the museum. The programme of the concert varies depending on the performer, but mostly the music played at The Sibelius Museum is focused on jazz, folk music and classical chamber music. Details of the facade The archives of The Sibelius Museum dates back to the collections of professor Otto Andersson of the Musicological Department at √Öbo Akademi University. The archives contain material from several different aspects of musical life in Finland, such as manuscripts, photographs and recordings. There are additionally several special collections in the archives. These collections include an extensive collection about Jean Sibelius, the Otto Andersson archival collection and the archive of the Musical Society of Turku. In addition to the exhibitions and the archives, there are also a couple of auditoriums and classrooms in the premises of the museum. For instance, the auditoriums Brahe and Flora that have been named after the student choirs of √Öbo Akademi University, Brahe Dj√§knar and Florak√∂ren.  History  A grand piano in the Sibelius Hall = Time before the museum: Pehr Kalm and the botanical garden = At the site of The Sibelius Museum, the botanical garden of the Royal Academy of Turku (Swedish: Kungliga Akademien I √Öbo, Finnish: Kuninkaallinen Turun Akatemia) was located. Pehr Kalm, a pupil of Carl von Linn√©, founded the garden in 1757. In the garden, he planted plants from his trips to North America and Russia. After the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, the only plant that survived was an Oak tree that stands between the bank of the river Aura and the current museum building. After the fire, printer Christian Ludvig Hjelt bought the site of the garden in 1831 and built a couple of wooden houses on the plot. = √Öbo Akademi University = In 1923, Ellen and Magnus Dahlstr√∂m donated the site of the garden to the √Öbo Akademi Foundation in a will. Attempts to restore the garden to its original state were made during the 1930s, during which Justus Montell aimed at planting his collections next to the oak from Kalm's era. After he died in 1954 the attempts were ended, which lead to the decaying of the garden and demolitions of the houses built by Hjelt. = Otto Andersson as the founder of the Musicological Department and Archives = Further details on the wall The foundations of the proper historical music museum were already made in 1926, when Otto Andersson was granted the professorship of the recently established Department of Musicology and Folklore at √Öbo Akademi University. The ship-owner Robert Mattson donated the necessary funds to fund the professorship and to purchase materials for the collection and the seminar. Also, Mattson's son, Curt, had donated a notable collection of instruments from all around the world for the collections of professor Andersson. The original idea behind the collections was, however, to form a seminar for the Department of Musicology that would have as large of a library as possible. = The Museum receives its current name = Before the year 1949, The Sibelius Museum did not yet have a proper name, and it was simply known as \\"The historical music collections of √Öbo Akademi University\\". In the late 1940s, an exhibition about the composer Jean Sibelius was organised. There were several items placed in the exhibition varying from sheet music to letters and manuscripts. Some journalist miscalled the exhibition \\"The Sibelius Museum\\", which aroused controversy between professor Andersson and the rector of √Öbo Akademi University G.O. Rosenqvist. To avoid any further confusion about the exhibition, professor Andersson sent a letter to the composer, in which he asked a formal permission to use the name of Sibelius in official contexts. The composed replied in 16 January 1949 with the following words:After the name change, the museum received its first permanent premises in the house that currently works as the restaurant Hus Lindman. In the manor at Piispankatu 15, \\"The Sibelius Museum\\" had seven rooms in use, to which the collections and the administrative areas were placed. At the same time, new acquisitions were increased. For example, Andersson travelled with these purposes in America during the 1950s. The years in this building turned out to be long and hard, and hopes for an exclusive building for the museum were arisen. = The planning of the current building = Towards the end of the 1950s, several discussions were made between the city of Turku and √Öbo Akademi University to build a joint museum about Jean Sibelius and W√§in√∂ Aaltonen. The idea was put forward with the thought of using the site of the garden from Kalm's era as the base for the museum. This joint venture, however, dissolved and only the plans to build The Sibelius Museum advanced. Regardless of this, the city of Turku still funded the project. Architect Woldemar Baeckman was during the 1960s assigned to design the building for the museum for √Öbo Akademi University. In his original plans, he had planned a separate wing for the choir activities of the university. Before the final plans, a couple of investigations were made in 1963 and 1966. The conclusion of these investigations was to give up this thought of building a separate wing and the focus was put on the main building. During the autumn of 1966, the final plans were finished and during the next year, the construction work started. The construction of the building was completed in February 1968, during which the building was put in use. Architectural design The Atrium of The Sibelius Museum The building is a notable example of the Brutalist concrete architecture of its time, though Baeckman's earlier architecture was more classically modernist in style, most notably the extension to the √Öbo Akademi University Library. The exterior architecture is notable for the grains of the timber formwork being visible in the prefabricated concrete facades. The interior is particularly notable for the large hyperbolic paraboloid-shaped concrete shell structure, said to have been influenced by the then contemporaneous architecture of the Mexican architect F√©lix Candela. In the centre of the building is a hidden courtyard which originally had a garden (since demolished) designed by noted Finnish garden designer Maj-Lis Rosenbr√∂ijer.

Early life  Curti-Schloss (demolished in 1963) of the Curtius Baronets, the Curti di Gravedonna family, and of Sir William's first wife Anna von Gressenich have been moved to the walls of the schoolGerman secondary school qualifying for university admission or matriculation that is now on the site. The di Curti family were Italian lower nobility from the Lombardian region around Gravedona. Branches of the family moved along Lake Geneva and the river Rhine (ex allobrogius) to the German area of the Electoral Palatinate. Sir William's father settled at the city of Bensheim, where Curtius was born in 1599.S.

His studies at the University of Heidelberg were disrupted by the initial events of the Thirty Years War. Curtius moved to the Calvinist Herborn Academy in 1621, where he studied with Alstedius, \\"the Encyclopediast\\". After two years of study at Herborn, Curtius enrolled at the Academy of Geneva, the spiritual stronghold of the Reformed Church. In 1627, he enrolled at the Sorbonne; he concluded his studies at the University of Siena.  English diplomat  thumbleftSir William Curtius, 1st Bt by Robert Cooper, after Unknown artist. Stipple engraving, early 19th century. NPG D30756 Early in the Thirty Year's War Curtius' homeland, the Palatinate, was occupied by Habsburg and Catholic League forces, after the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II decisively defeated the Elector Palatine Frederick V at the 1820 Battle of White Mountain and replaced him as King of Bohemia. The exiled Frederick and his wife Elizabeth Stuart received military and diplomatic support from the Protestant kingdoms of England and Scotland, which were ruled by Elizabeth's brother King Charles I. The successful 1830 invasion of the Holy Roman Empire by the Swedish King, Gustavus Adolfus, gave them new hope of reclaiming their Palatinate lands and their titles as King and Queen of Bohemia. Curtius was employed as a secretary to Frederick from 1629, possibly on the recommendation of his friend Joachim, son of the Palatinate administrator Ludwig Camerarius. In 1632, King Charles sent his senior courtier Henry Vane to the Swedish King to seek stronger support for the Palatine cause. Vane employed William Curtius as his secretary for the mission. As secretary, Curtius carried letters and messages between the key players. He returned from his first visit to England with letters recalling Vane but entrusting him to continue Vane's work. In return for a salary of 1,000 pounds per month, he was appointed as resident of the English Crown to the King of Sweden. It was in this English role that he was one of the last people to meet with the Elector Palatine in November 1632, when Frederick was already displaying early symptoms of the plague that killed him only days later. Curtius remained in Germany as an Agent of Charles I of England until November 1633.  In the Palatine service  Curtius visited London several times during the 1630s. In 1633, the Administrator of the Palatinate sent Curtius back to London to seek King Charles' financial support to raise garrisons for the Palatinate fortresses liberated by the Swedish. Curtius was based in London into 1634, hoping to be further employed by Charles I. Elizabeth Stuart wrote to diplomat Sir William Boswell in his support, I pray remember what I saide to you about Curtius that if the king my deare Brother will not keep him in his service, he may be dismissed with his favour, and the sooner the better for the poore man is there [in London] on his own purse and cannot be paid what is owing of him. He attended a joint assembly of Protestant princes in Frankfurt in April. Late in the year, he returned to Elizabeth's exiled court at The Hague, having failed to secure material English support for the Palatinate cause. Curtius was back in London in 1636 as chaperone for Elizabeth's teenage sons Charles Louis and Prince Rupert. He reported back to Elizabeth in great detail on various discussions and negotiations that Charles Louis had had with King Charles and others, seeking funds and other support.  English Resident in Germany  Curtis again took up an official English role when Charles I appointed him as representative of England at the Imperial Diet of N√ºrnberg in 1639 and 1649, and at Frankfurt in 1642. He also supported Sir Thomas Roe in Vienna in 1641‚Äì42. At the same time, Curtius represented Kurprinz Charles Louis as a member of the Palatine Council working to have the Elector Palatine's lands returned to him. Curtius was appointed by Charles I as official resident of the English Crown in the Holy Roman Empire in 1645. In 1652, when he was appointed to the Baronetcy by the then-exiled Charles II, Curtius was \\"resident for his majesty, with Gustavus, King of Sweden, and the princes of Germany\\". Charles II described him as \\"borne in these partes, and long imployed there by our father of blessed memory\\" On 5 August 1664, four years after Charles II's Restoration, Sir William was appointed Resident Ambassador at Frankfurt am Main, and remained so until recredentialled in September 1677.  German governor  small hand is from the Arms of Ulster, included as an inescutcheon on the armorial bearings of all English Baronets. Curtius was appointed Oberamtmann ‚Äì Bailiff, or District Governor ‚Äì in Umstadt from 1650 to 1672. At that time, half the city was owned by the Palatinate as a condominium with the changing successors of the Landgraviate of Hesse: the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel and Hesse- Rheinfels. During this time, he was appointed to the Imperial Nobility, the \\"Reichsadel\\". He also returned to England in 1661, to attend his Queen Elizabeth at the end of her life, and was at the top of her official list of mourners.  Fellow of the Royal Society  Sir William was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society on 3 October 1667. He corresponded with both Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Society, and Gottfried Leibniz, bringing the latter a copy of Wilkin's Encyclopaedic Essay. \\"Mr Oldenburg read a Latin letter to himself from Sir William Curtius dated at Umbstad December 2 1668 containing assurances of his willingnese to send what philosophical communications he could out of Germany and particularly from the Elector of Mentz and from the physician of the Landgrave of Hesse Darmstadt. This letter was ordered to be entered in the Letter Book.\\"  Family and legacy  Curtius may have lost a family during the thirty year's war. On his return to the Palatinate, he married Catharina Fabricius gennant von Gressinich; her father Peter Fabricius was a Palatinate judge, her mother Anna Hoeufft was the sister of Jan Hoeufft, Dutch treasurer to Louis XIV of France. After Catharina's death in 1652, Curtius married the widow of the mayor of Frankfurt, Anna Sibylla von Stalburg, who was born to a Viennese banking family. His son, Sir Johann William, succeeded as the second Baronet Curtius and as Oberamtmann in Umstadt from 1681 to 1691. In popular culture In the novel Quicksilver, Neal Stephenson quotes from The History of the Royal Society of London, in which \\"the president produced from Sir William Curtius a hairy ball found in the belly of a cow\\".

Arndt Bause produced more than 1350 dance music melodies, many of which became \\"hits\\", which meant that he had a decisive influence on the music scene in East Germany for this genre. Many of his compositions have acquired \\"Evergreen\\" status.  Life  Arndt Bause was born in Leipzig, the fourth of the recorded children of Werner Bause, an accountant, and his wife Emma. For several years, starting in 1948, Arndt Bause was made to learn the piano: by 1955 he had been captivated by music in general and Boogie-woogie in particular. He made progress as a self taught musician and started to appear in several bands, both as a pianist and as an accordionist. Between 1960 and 1963 he was also taking trombone lessons. Meanwhile, out of deference to his father's wishes, he had embarked on an apprenticeship in the relatively secure trade of glass blowing, which in 1954 he completed. By the time he completed his glass blowing apprenticeship his performing career had progressed to a point where he felt able to leave glass blowing on one side and focus on the music. He was a member of various groups which were soon getting contracts for concert and theatre work. On 6 October 1959 he married Angret Hinsch, the daughter of a plumber from Schwerin. Their three daughters were born in 1962, 1965 and 1968. With a growing family to support, Bause's income from music proved insufficient, and he returned to his trade of glass blowing. He never abandoned the music, but there was no longer time to follow an extensive performance schedule, and he turned increasingly to composing. In 1962 an orchestral composition was accepted for transmission on the radio. Soon afterwards, teaming up with the lyricist Dieter Schneider, he began to produce a series of hit songs. The collaboration with Schnieder brought Bause into the East German world of Schlager music. In 1964 the two of them came up with \\"He, Joe\\" which in 1964, sung by Gypsy, reached top place in the \\"Tip Parade\\", a hit parade-style ranking at this time organised by the national television service. Further successes followed, with songs written not just for Gypsy, but also for , Frank Sch√∂bel and Andreas Holm. In addition to Schneider, he was also working with lyricists such as and Kurt Demmler. By 1968 his compositions were bringing in enough money to enable him to abandon glass blowing again, this time for good. He was able to use some of the time saved to undertake an external course in composition and tonal structure (\\"Tonsatz\\") at the \\"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\\" Music Academy in Leipzig between 1969 and 1974. In 1975 Bause relocated with his family from Leipzig to Berlin. In April 1976 they acquired a plot of land in Berlin-Biesdorf, which is where Arndt would live for the rest of his life. The later 1970s were a period of intense collaboration with the singer J√ºrgen Walter. Between 1976 and 1982 they produced three LPs, incorporating demanding lyricss by Gisela Steineckert. In 1979 he wrote the melody for J√ºrgen Hart's Sing mei Sachse sing, which became his top selling title and featured on an LP entitled \\"Hart auf Hart\\" with which the two of them followed up the success of the single. In the 1980s Helga Hahnemann became the leading performer of Bause's songs, using lyrics by Angela Gentzmer. It was later reported that the professional collaboration with Hahnemann began after she accused him, \\"I never get any hits from you\\" (in their shared Leipzig variant of German: \\"Ick krieg wohl keenen Hit von Ihnen?\\"). By the time of her death in November 1991 their professional partnership was complemented by a close family friendship. Bause also wrote film music. His output included the music for two television films based on \\"talking head\\"-style monologues from Maxie Wander's book, \\"Guten Morgen, Du Schone\\" (\\"Good Morning My Lovely\\") and 24 \\"trick films\\" (animations) from the national film studio of which \\"The Flying windmills\\" (\\"Die fliegende Windm√ºhle\\") became probably the best known. Working with librettiste Gerda Malig he also wrote, the musical \\"Gesang der Grille\\", which had its premier in 1987 at the Popular Theatre (\\"Volkstheater\\") in Halberstadt, followed by a successful tour of the country that included Berlin's Metropol Theatre (as it was then known). After the changes that led to reunification in 1990 there was less demand for his music as audiences in East Germany, for the first time, had unfettered exposure to the more diverse palette of West German Schlager music. The death of Helga Hahnemann in 1991 also removed from stage and screen someone who had, by that time, become the leading performer of his music. Arndt Bause died in Berlin suddenly, but surrounded by his family, following a major pulmonary embolism.  Family  The eldest daughter of Arndt and Angret Bause, Katrin Gawenda, became the first \\"Miss DDR\\" (\\"Miss East Germany\\") when, in 1986, the r√©gime cautiously, and under conditions of bizarre secrecy, arranged a national beauty pageant inside a large temporarily reassigned fire station in Berlin-Marzahn. Her participation in the contest, which initially came as a surprise, resulted from a prank by her then husband, Christian Gawenda. Although her beauty was never in doubt, interviewed many years later she implied that her win might also have owed something to her aptitude as an interviewee. Asked by the moderator to name her favourite hobby, she replied, uncontroversially, that it was fishing. As a follow-up question she was asked about the biggest fish she had ever caught. \\"6ft2, 75 kilos, my husband Christian\\" (\\"1,86 Meter gro√ü, 75 Kilo schwer. Mein Mann Christian.\\") The reply captured the spirit of the times and of the event: the audience applauded, shortly after which she received the crown. Their youngest daughter, Inka Bause, embarked on her own career as a singer in 1985, at this point performing her father's songs. More recently she has also appeared as a television presenter of popular entertainment shows.

The Buccaneers compete in the Men's State Basketball League (SBL) and play their home games at Activewest Stadium. The team is affiliated with Geraldton Amateur Basketball Association (GABA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the region. Team history =Establishment= In the 1980s, the highest level of basketball in the state of Western Australia was played in the Perth-based District Competition. In an effort to expand the league, the Western Australian Basketball Federation began approaching various business people in the country areas to gauge their interest in a statewide basketball competition. Among those approached were Brian Middleton and Graham Greenaway, residents of Geraldton. Middleton and Greenaway convinced Kevin Jones, the Administrator of the Geraldton Amateur Basketball Association (GABA), to join them in establishing a basketball team in Geraldton. With Jones leading the project, Middleton and Greenaway provided funding for the licence and became the team's private owners. They served as the licencees until the GABA eventually bought the rights to the team. Geraldton was joined by Albany and Bunbury, and then Kalgoorlie and Mandurah. =Early success= 1989 saw the formation of the State Basketball League (SBL). Initially known as the Batavia Buccaneers, the team's inaugural coaching staff included Head Coach Tom McClain, a former player for the Perth Wildcats, and his two assistants, Kevin Jones and Jim O'Dea. Americans Dan Hunt and Brian Funingsland were the team's first two import players, while Perth native Ray Chamberlain joined the squad. All three players were members of the East Perth Eagles' 1988 premiership team. The Buccaneers finished their inaugural season as minor premiers, earning first place on the standings with a 19‚Äì3 record. They defeated the Willetton Tigers 106‚Äì93 in the semi-finals before losing 114‚Äì89 to the Perth Redbacks in the SBL Grand Final. In 1993, the Buccaneers won their second minor premiership after finishing the regular season in first place with a 19‚Äì5 record. In 1996, they made their first grand final appearance since 1989, where they lost 103‚Äì86 to the Bunbury City Slammers. In 1997, they returned to the SBL Grand Final, where they lost 94‚Äì92 to the Perth Redbacks. In 2000, the Buccaneers finished on top of the West Conference table with a league-best 17‚Äì2 record. They made it through to their fourth SBL Grand Final, where behind a 30-point effort from Greg Brown, they defeated the Lakeside Lightning 96‚Äì76 to win their maiden championship. Alongside Brown, Canadian forward Jeff Bevington had 25 points and 15 rebounds while Daniel McGlynn had 18 points. The following season, the Buccs made their fifth grand final appearance in 13 years, but despite a 30-point effort from Bevington, they were defeated 101‚Äì83 by the Perry Lakes Hawks. =Sixth grand final appearance= The Buccaneers played in the finals every year throughout the 2000s. In 2011, they missed the finals for the first time since 1998. They again missed the finals in 2012 before returning to form in 2013 with a playoff appearance. Following their revival in 2013, the Buccaneers headed into the 2014 season not settling for anything less than a championship. Behind imports Carter Cook and Jerrah Young, as well as former Melbourne Tigers player Bennie Lewis and veterans Aaron Ralph, Mat Wundenberg and Luke Wrensted, the Buccaneers claimed their first minor premiership since 2000 with a 19‚Äì7 record. They went on to beat the South West Slammers and Lakeside Lightning in four straight playoff matches to reach their first SBL Grand Final since 2001. However, they came up short in the championship decider as they were defeated 99‚Äì83 by the East Perth Eagles. The Buccaneers had now won just the one championship from six grand final appearances. =Early finals exits= In 2015, the Buccaneers remained in the mix for top championship contenders as they finished the regular season in second place with a 20‚Äì6 record. Despite their impressive season and boasting a roster that included Carter Cook, Bennie Lewis, Aaron Ralph, Daniel Thomas and Cory Cooperwood, the Buccaneers were outclassed by the seventh-seeded Goldfields Giants in the quarter-finals, losing the series 2‚Äì0. Despite losing Bennie Lewis for the 2016 season, the Buccaneers were able to cover his loss by acquiring Matthew Adekponya and Jackson Hussey, while also signing Maurice Barrow to complement four-year import Carter Cook. They went on to lead the Buccs to a fourth-place finish with an 18‚Äì8 record, before advancing to the semi-finals where they were swept by the eventual champion Cockburn Cougars. The 2017 season started off well for the Buccaneers, as they went 6‚Äì1 over the first seven games. The Buccs' early-season form demonstrated their ability to cover all areas, with imports Maurice Barrow and Dwayne Benjamin tremendously versatile, Mat Wundenberg and James Paringatai experienced bigs, Jackson Hussey and Matt Hancock a strong back court, and Aaron Ralph a sharpshooter off the bench. They went on to finish the regular season in third place with a 19‚Äì7 record before reaching the semi-finals, where they were defeated 2‚Äì1 by the Joondalup Wolves despite taking the first game. There was a mass turnover in the playing stocks for the Buccaneers leading into 2018, with Benjamin and Hancock moving on, while Hussey and Barrow also departed to join the defending champion Perth Redbacks. As a result, they picked up imports Gokul Natesan and Colter Lasher, to go with Marcus Alipate of Tonga and Earnest Ross of Guam. With a 23‚Äì3 record in 2018, the Buccaneers won their first minor premiership since 2014. It also marked the Buccs' best regular-season record since 2001, when they finished second at 24‚Äì2. They went on to lose to the eighth-seeded Rockingham Flames in straight sets in the quarter-finals. =Second championship= The Buccaneers retained the services of import Colter Lasher for the 2019 season, while losing Natesan and Ross. Initial import Willie Conner was replaced mid-season by DeAngelo Isby, who himself was later released during the quarter-finals. The Buccaneers finished the regular season in third place with a 19‚Äì7 record, and after two three-game playoff series, they reached the SBL Grand Final. In what was their seventh championship decider, the Buccaneers defeated the Joondalup Wolves 92‚Äì80 to win their second championship.

Primary and secondary school education he finished in Kotor, Cetinje and Belgrade. From January 1944 he joined to Tito's partisans. He finished undergraduate studies at Belgrade University: at the Faculty of Law in 1950 and at the Faculty of Philosophy in 1956. From 1958 he dedicated himself to historiography and started his academic career as a researcher at the History Department of the Institute of Social Sciences (May 1958-August 1963). He earned his PhD degree at the Belgrade University Faculty of Law in 1962. As a researcher he worked at the Department for the History of the Yugoslav Workers' Movement of the Workers' Movement Research Institute (September 1963-January 1969) and the Institute of Contemporary History (January‚ÄìNovember 1969). From 1969, he was an associate professor and from 1975 a full professor at the Belgrade University Faculty of Philosophy, Department of History. Petranoviƒá was also a member of editorial and advisory boards of numerous historical journals and anthologies (Istorija XX veka, Istorijski glasnik, Vojnoistorijski glasnik, Jugoslovenski istorijski ƒçasopis, etc.).

He died on 17 June 1994 and was buried in Belgrade. Historiography Petranoviƒá published 32 books in 38 volumes, 314 scientific papers in conferences proceedings and scientific journals and 259 surveys in scientific journals. He authored two TV documentaries dedicated to the history of Yugoslavia. He was a 20th-century historian who Yugoslav and foreign academics dedicated 296 articles to. His academic archives, found after his death, were source for additional six books (out of which one was published in the United States) and ten new scientific papers. He contributed to the transformation of the Yugoslav Communist Party institutions from party services into serious research institutes. As a historian he fought against fanaticism, fatalism, and taboo creation in historiography i.e. fought against historian being a privileged liar of the rulers.The \\"privileged liar\\" phrase was borrowed from the H. de Balsac's Catherine de Medici: There is a general cry of paradox when scholars, struck by some historical error, attempt to correct it; but, for whoever studies modern history to its depths, it is plain that historians are privileged liars, who lend their pen to popular beliefs precisely as the newspapers of the day, or most of them, express the opinions of their readers. Most his academic research and career was dedicated to the 20th century epoch and to Yugoslavia. Historian Ljubodrag Dimiƒá, in his Foreword to Branko Petranoviƒá: The Yugoslav Experience of Serbian National Integration, stressed that the twentieth century epoch in Yugoslavia was not inclined to the historian, especially not to the one who was trying to gain rational knowledge about the history of the Yugoslav state and society. In the first years following the Second World War, ideological and political conditions were not favorable for the study of history. The knowledge of history was considered to be unnecessary and, quite often, undesirable. The interests of the revolution, the people, the state and the working class were colliding with the postulates of the profession. These, for a historian, unfavorable social conditions were something he faced and understood as a dictature. Even when his works were influenced by the ruling communist ideology and its phraseology, the same works provided numerous insights into main problems of the historic development of Yugoslav state. As a historian, he was led by his principle stating that a historian cannot dedicate himself to the history of his times without confronting his own work and results to other historians research.Peri≈°iƒá, Miroslav: Branko Petranoviƒá (In memoriam) in Jugoslovenski istorijski ƒçasopis, Issues 1-2, Savez dru≈°tava istoriƒçara Jugoslavije, Belgrade, 1999., page 297-301 He thought that disintegration of second Yugoslavia was a tragic event and, as a historian, he tried to thoroughly examine the multiple causes hidden behind the politics which lead to the disintegration of both Yugoslavias. He stated that Yugoslavia was the only state keeping all Serbs inside the same state and that both Yugoslavias disintegrated due to the fact that they were dictatures with no democratic alternative. He stated that the dictatures were not able to counter taboos, religious intolerance and divisions, uneven economic development of Yugoslav regions, and influence and interest of great powers. His overall research can be summarized by the twentieth century themesDimiƒá, Ljubodrag; Lonƒçar, Dragomir: Branko Petranoviƒá, Bibliography and Biobibliography, Faculty of Philosophy, Belgrade University 1996 *Kingdom of Yugoslavia *History of Serbia in WWII *Communist Yugoslavia *WWII resistance movement in Europe *role of a historian in contemporary epoch Petranoviƒá influenced a group of his students who became later historians at Belgrade University: Ljubodrag Dimiƒá, Desanka Pe≈°iƒá, Latinka Peroviƒá, for example. He advised his graduate students not to be historians of a single subject, rather historians of a century. He taught his students to think about a single event as an event in the context of the world history process within local environment.Ljubodrag Dimiƒá: Eksplozija istorije (in Serbian) Selected works        References External links *Petranovic about destruction of two Yugoslavias (in Serbian) *T.

It was brought by the food writer and activist Jack Monroe against the columnist Katie Hopkins after Hopkins falsely alleged that Monroe had vandalised a war memorial. Hopkins was ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in damage and legal fees.  Background  Monument to the Women of World War II During an anti-austerity protest in 2015, protesters spraypainted \\"fuck Tory scum\\" on the Monument to the Women of World War II in Whitehall, London. On the social media site Twitter, the political writer Laurie Penny said she had no problem with the vandalism. Katie Hopkins, a rightwing columnist, reacted negatively, suggesting that Penny be sent to join the Islamic State. Both writers' comments received national media coverage.Judgment: Monroe -v- Hopkins, HM Courts and Tribunal Service 2017. On 18 May, a few days later, Hopkins tweeted to the food writer Jack Monroe: \\"Scrawled on any war memorials recently?\\" Monroe responded that she had never vandalised a war memorial and had family members in the armed forces. Hopkins responded in a tweet asking someone to explain the difference between Penny (an \\"irritant\\") and Monroe (\\"social anthrax\\"). Monroe asked for a retraction via Twitter and was blocked by Hopkins. Monroe asked Hopkins to make a public apology and give ¬£5,000 to \\"migrant rescue\\" as a settlement to prevent the matter going to court. Hopkins did neither, and the matter proceeded to court.  Decision  On 10 March 2017, Mr Justice Warby judged that the two tweets sent by Hopkins were defamatory to Monroe (according to the Defamation Act 2013) and were the source of \\"serious harm\\", a prerequisite for demonstrating libel. The court assessed the damage to Monroe at ¬£24,000‚Äî¬£16,000 for the first tweet, and ¬£8,000 for the second. Hopkins was also ordered to pay costs, estimated at over ¬£300,000. Warby's judgment discussed the difficulty of applying English libel law to new media platforms like Twitter, and contains an extended discussion on how Twitter functions.  Aftermath  Some days after the decision, Hopkins, who did not appear in court, stated that she was \\"very likely\\" to appeal against the ruling, on the grounds that no evidence of harm had been produced in the court. About two and a half weeks after the judgment Hopkins was told she could not appeal; Warby said Hopkins' appeal would not have \\"a real prospect of success\\" in his view. A week after the verdict, Monroe said she bore \\"no ill will\\" towards Hopkins: \\"Although what she said about me was wrong and the last two years have been a grim process, I would happily sit down and talk as adults. I just think the world is a bit better when you are willing to give people chances.\\" Monroe said she hoped the case will set a precedent and improve Twitter. Hopkins sold her Exeter home in March 2018 to pay the debts arising from the case, and applied for an individual voluntary arrangement in May.

All four crew members on board, Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Chief Pilot Mark Duffy, winch operator Paul Ormsby, and winch man Ci√°ran Smith were killed. In a preliminary report published in April 2017, the Air Accident Investigation Unit found that the helicopter had clipped the small island of Blackrock at an altitude of around while on approach to Blacksod Lighthouse for a refuelling stop, and subsequently crashed out of control into the sea. Events On 14 March 2017, Rescue 118 had completed the medical evacuation of an injured fisherman west of Blacksod, for which Rescue 116 had provided support, and was returning. Shannon ATC last had communication from Rescue 116 at shortly before the crash announcing 'making our way to Blacksod for refuel'. Refuelling is a common practice in a long- range and lengthy SAR mission. The helicopter itself did not make any mayday call, but disappeared from air traffic control radar around 12:45am and failed to arrive at Blacksod, prompting the issuing of a declaration of emergency by the Marine Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Dublin. Rescue 118 was advised of the situation and routed to Blacksod to begin a search for the missing helicopter. Rescue 115, the Shannon Airport-based Coast Guard helicopter, was immediately dispatched to the area to aid in the search, along with a CASA CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft from the Irish Air Corps. The Irish Naval Service offshore patrol vessel L√â R√≥is√≠n arrived in the search zone at 9:00 am on 14 March. Divers from the Naval Service Diving Section and Garda Water Unit and RNLI vessels were also sent to the scene. Investigators from the Air Accident Investigation Unit attended the scene on the same day. The Naval Service flagship L√â Eithne joined the search effort that afternoon, and both Naval Service vessels continued the search throughout the night and into the next day. Eithne was made on-scene coordinator of the recovery mission. The Marine Institute's RV Celtic Voyager was dispatched on the night of 14 March to search using multibeam echosounders to help locate the wreckage. The Commissioners of Irish Lights also sent the ILV Granuaile, an advanced multifunctional vessel, to the scene. The Marine Institute's work class ROV Holland one was mobilised onto the Granuaile in Galway harbour . The vessel is equipped with a dynamic positioning system which allows it to operate in difficult sea conditions, cranes capable of hoisting recovered wreckage and a helicopter platform. The Geological Survey of Ireland surveyed the underwater region and carried out detailed mapping where the search was focused on to aid diving teams in the recovery of the wreckage. The Navy's L√â Samuel Beckett later joined the recovery efforts and assumed command as the on-scene coordinator. On the afternoon of 15 March, a signal transmitting from the helicopter's flight recorder had been received by a team from the Irish Marine Institute using USBL equipment from a local fishing vessel. The signal emanated at around southwest of Blackrock Island, west of the coast at Blacksod Bay. On 16 March, AAIU investigators were airlifted onto the helipad at Blackrock lighthouse, where a significant section of wreckage from Rescue 116 was found on the high rocky island. From the examination of this tail section AAIU investigators believe that the tail of the helicopter made contact with the western slopes of Blackrock. The preliminary report by AAIU investigators found that the helicopter had hit the island, which was registered in the craft's GPS mapping system but not on EGPWS. (EGPWS) is a legacy capable Class A terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) designed for digitally equipped aircraft. Intense SAR operations continued on Saint Patrick's Day on 17 March. Captain Dara Fitzpatrick's funeral took place on 18 March in Glencullen, Dublin. Poor weather conditions continued to impede the search. Air Corps resources issues In the aftermath of the incident, the Defence Forces said in a statement that the Air Corps had originally been contacted at 10:06 pm on 13 March by the Coast Guard, with a request to provide top cover to Rescue 118 which was tasked with evacuating a fisherman to hospital from a vessel west of the Mayo. In the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the \\"provision and tasking of Air Corps assets [is] on an 'as available' basis\\". The Air Corps denied the request because of a staff shortage in experienced and trained personnel, which made it unable to operate an \\"out-of-hours\\" roster. This meant Rescue 116 was deployed instead to provide top cover. Following the Blacksod incident, an Irish Times report highlighted how resourcing issues delayed the Air Corps involvement in the rescue, and highlighted that Air Corps' CASA maritime patrol fixed-wing aircraft have advantages over CHC operated helicopters in top-cover situations, in that they can arrive \\"twice as fast\\" and \\"remain circling in its higher vantage point for up to nine hours\\". At 1:45 am, an hour after last contact from Rescue 116, the Coast Guard made an emergency request for assistance to the Air Corps to help search for the missing SAR helicopter. The Air Corps activated its recall plan and 3 hours and 45 minutes after the Coast Guard's initial request for top cover, a CASA CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft was airborne. The Defence Forces said that in 2017 three requests for top cover had to be refused due to reduced availability. Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny, who was also Minister for Defence, said that it was \\"well known\\" that the Air Corps had lost a number of personnel such as pilots and air traffic controllers in recent years. Minister with responsibility for Defence Paul Kehoe said that reduction in the capacity of the Air Corps was notified in summer 2016 to agencies and that the Department of Defence had made other arrangements in that regard. Since the crash took place, there have remained safety concerns for search and rescue helicopter services in Ireland, with problems including cartographic errors and omissions, problems with the navigational software, inadequate life jackets and a lack of oversight of the Search and Rescue service. Wreckage recovery and search for the missing On 22 March, the wreckage from R116 was found by the Marine Institute Holland 1 ROV after signals from the flight data recorder pinger were received as well as some items of wreckage on Blackrock. There were hopes that the bodies of the missing crew members could be found in the wreckage. On 24 March, Naval Service divers recovered the flight recorder from the wreckage on the sea bed on the eastern side of Blackrock, at a depth of 40 metres. Air Accident Investigation Unit chief inspector Jurgen Whyte confirmed that the black box was \\"visually in good condition\\" and would be flown under escort to the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch for the data to be downloaded. Later on the same day Naval divers discovered the body of one of the three missing crew members in the cockpit section of the wreckage. On 26 March the body of the crew member was retrieved from the wreckage by NSDS divers and identified as that of co-pilot Captain Mark Duffy. On 30 March, the funeral took place of Captain Duffy in County Louth. Throughout the recovery attempts weather and sea conditions have forced diving to be suspended for long periods for safety reasons. The large sea surface and underwater swells and currents around Blackrock Island have been making it dangerous for divers to operate and decompress safely from the 40m depths at which the wreckage lies. In tandem with wreckage salvage there were extensive aerial, sea and coastline searches. On 1 April, The AAIU announced no mechanical anomalies were identified from initial data from the recorders and therefore no additional safety actions would be required on similar helicopter types. The AAIU also stated they intended to make a preliminary report in the near future. A superintendent from Belmullet Garda√≠ said that the wreckage recovery of a section of the wreckage should take a matter of hours once suitable conditions arose to enable a safe lift. On the evening of 2 April, the main bulk of the helicopter was raised from the sea and placed aboard the Irish Lights vessel Granuaile. After the lifting of the wreckage, it was confirmed that there was still no sighting of either winch operator Paul Ormsby or winch man Ci√°ran Smith. The search for the missing crew members continues. On 3 April, the Irish Coastguard indicated to the families of the missing crewmen not to give up hope as they would continue searching for the missing crewmen. At the suggestion of local fisherman the families of the missing crewman also appealed for fishermen and seafarers in Donegal and elsewhere where wreckage debris had been found or was likely to join in the search as their local knowledge would be invaluable. On the weekend of 8 April 2017 over 110 fishing vessels joined RNLI lifeboats, Irish Coast Guard and others in a co-ordinated sweep of over 8,500 square kilometres from Blacksod to Donegal in one of the largest sea searches in Irish maritime history. As the missing were not located the next phase would be targeted searches and vigilance of special areas of interest.  Tributes  The Rescue 116 helicopter with the same four crew members involved in the crash was present in Series 3 Episode 1 of the Irish TV show Paramedics, after being called in to assist in the extraction of a teenage boy with a dislocated patella within a remote field, three weeks before the fatal Rescue 116 crash. Rescue 116 was unable to land in the field due to electrical cables and livestock which would have made it unsafe to land, and so, Rescue 116 was forced to return to its base. A tribute was made by the paramedics involved in the rescue of the teenage boy within the episode. Final report The Air Accident Investigation Unit circulated a 333 draft version of the final report into the crash in November 2019. The report was delayed, prompting a review - the first in the 25 year history of the AAIU.

Background During late November 1967, U.S. intelligence detected that the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 22nd Regiment of the 3rd Division was about to commence operations in the B·ªìng S∆°n area. Between 1 and 4 December the PAVN made probing attacks against Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) positions along Highway 1, however U.S. and ARVN forces were unable to locate the PAVN. Battle Battle of Tam Quan 6-11 December 1967 On the afternoon of 6 December, the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division received intelligence on the location of the headquarters of the PAVN 22nd Regiment near the village of Dai Dong and aero-scout helicopters from A Troop, 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment (1/9th) were sent to investigate. The helicopters saw a radio antenna and were fired on and at 16:30 aero-rifle troops were landed nearby, but were quickly pinned down by enemy fire. At 16:55 D Troop was landed to support A Troop, but they were also pinned down. At 17:25 the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment (1/8th) was ordered to engage and by 18:00 had landed nearby and joined up with an ACAV platoon from the 1st Battalion, 50th Infantry Regiment (1/50th) that had moved forward from Landing Zone English. By 21:00 this combined force had managed to extract the 1/9th troops. The force then set up a night perimeter. From 07:25 on the morning of 7 December the site of the previous day's engagement was hit with aerial rocket and artillery fire and by 09:15 Company A 1/8th and Companies B and C 2/8th had been landed by helicopter and together with the ARVN 40th Regiment formed a perimeter around the area. The 1/8th then began moving east towards the blocking forces, but met strong resistance from the entrenched PAVN and pulled back to allow tactical air strikes and artillery to soften up the positions. At 14:06 Companies A and B 1/8th, supported by flamethrower APCs, resumed the advance and broke through the PAVN positions while the 2/8th attacked westward. The operation resumed at 07:45 on 8 December with Company C 1/8th relieving Company B 1/8th. At 08:15 CS gas was fired into the PAVN positions, forcing some soldiers to flee, who were then hit by artillery fire. Aero-scout helicopters identified 23 PAVN soldiers killed. At 08:50 1/50th and Companies A and C 1/8th began sweeping the area, destroying the remaining PAVN positions. By 15:30 the sweeps were completed and forces began withdrawing to LZ English. At 05:00 on 10 December the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the ARVN 40th Regiment were attacked by the PAVN 8th Battalion, 22nd Regiment; the attack was repulsed with support by gunships and artillery. From dawn the ARVN carried out a series of attacks on the PAVN positions and at 15:45 were joined by Company D 1/50th for a final attack. On the morning of 10 December the ARVN received reports that the villagers of Truong Lam (2) () were fleeing the area, Companies B and D 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment (1/12th) joined Company B 1/50th to search Truong Lam. At 10:55 1/50th came under intense fire near Truong Lam (1), Company B 1/12th manoevured to their right flank, while Company C 1/12th was landed by helicopter on the left flank. This combined force made three attacks on the PAVN positions before breaking contact at 18:50. On the morning of 11 December following artillery preparation, 1/12th Cavalry assaulted Truong Lam (2) and met sporadic resistance until midday. During the day the ARVN 40th Regiment was replaced by the South Vietnamese 3rd and 4th Marine Battalions. At 22:15 Company D 2/8th Cavalry ambushed several PAVN units as they attempted to escape the area to the South. On 12 December the combined force of the Vietnamese Marines, 1/12th Cavalry and Company D 1/50th began a sweep of the area. They engaged a PAVN force at 10:55 and overran the position. Search and destroy operations continued on 13 and 14 December with little contact. On the morning of 15 December 1/12th Cavalry located the PAVN 22nd Regiment and was later joined by Company A 1/50th. Despite intensive air and artillery preparation the attack was repulsed and the force withdrew to allow for further supporting fire to soften up the PAVN positions. During the day the 40th ARVN Regiment, Company B 1/8th Cavalry and Companies A and D 2/8th Cavalry established blocking positions around the PAVN. On 16 December Companies A and C 1/50th supported by Company C 1/12th attacked north through the village of Truong Lam (1), meeting light resistance until midday. Companies A and D 2/8th Cavalry and Company C 1/50th pursued retreating PAVN. Search and destroy operations continued on 17 and 18 December with little contact. On 19 December intelligence was received on the location of the PAVN 22nd Regiment near the village of An Nghiep. Aerial reconnaissance by A Troop, 1/9th Cavalry located a radio antenna and a large bunker complex. At 14:08 Company D 2/8th Cavalry was landed by helicopter and immediately engaged by a PAVN force. Company D broke contact to allow for air and artillery fire and three more Companies were landed by helicopter to the south and west to establish blocking positions. Artillery and air strikes continued throughout the night and the following morning Company B 2/8th swept through An Nghiep, meeting no resistance from the destroyed PAVN bunkers. Aftermath The 2/8th Cavalry remained in An Nghiep for three days, destroying bunkers and recovering PAVN dead and weapons. Total losses in the battle were 58 U.S. killed and 250 wounded, ARVN losses were 30 killed and 71 wounded, and PAVN losses were 650 killed and 31 captured.

It was released in 1997 on American breakbeat label Moonshine Music and is the first series in Frolic's Happy 2b Hardcore series of DJ mix albums, documenting the emergence of happy hardcore music in the United Kingdom and Europe. The series itself is a spin-off of Moonshine's Speed Limit 140 BPM+ series of fast-tempo dance music compilations. The album was conceived to introduce American audiences to happy hardcore, and contains sixteen of the genre's anthems which carry many of happy hardcore's defining characteristics, such as fast tempo, frantic breakbeats, major key tonality, off-kilter, quirky keyboard effects and \\"semi-melodies.\\" Moonshine had modest anticipations for the album and their numerous promotional campaigns involved arranging for Frolic to promote the album on radio, a \\"whirlwind\\" of attention which took Frolic by surprise. The album was a surprise success, selling over 100,000 copies, a remarkable amount for a compilation of underground music. It is credited with helping increase the genre's spread in the United States and for inspiring Frolic's Hullabaloo happy hardcore rave in 1997, the first of its kind in the United States. Critics welcomed the album as a great introduction to happy hardcore, and Ned Raggett later named it the 102nd best album of the 1990s. Background Happy hardcore emerged largely in the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s, characterised by a very fast tempo (usually around 160‚Äì180 BPM), often matched with solo vocals and sentimental lyrics, and also by a generally major key tone, 4/4 beat \\"happy\\" sound distinguishes it from most other forms of hardcore, which tend to be \\"darker\\".\\"Business as usual for critic-proof Boys Pop Reviews ; Deck goes here\\" ‚Äì Toronto Star Initially, the genre was often additionally characterized by piano riffs, spacey sounds and synthetic stabs. In the UK, the long-running Bonkers series of happy hardcore DJ mix albums was the most popular happy hardcore compilation series, beginning in 1996 with an inaugural edition mixed by Hixxy and DJ Sharkey. American dance label Moonshine Music, known for importing electronic music from the UK and releasing it in the United States for the first time, conceived Happy 2b Hardcore in 1996 as a means to introduce American audiences to the genre. The label's repertoire at that point consisted of rave music and UK hardcore genres, including jungle music, drum and bass and breakbeat techno; however, they had not released any happy hardcore music. They contacted Canadian happy hardcore enthusiast and disc jockey Anabolic Frolic, who had sent them an unsolicited demo, to compile and mix the album. Due to the music's fast tempo, Happy 2b Hardcore was released as a spin-off to the label's long-running breakbeat hardcore series of compilations, Speed Limit 140 BPM+. Music Happy 2b Hardcore's liner notes describe the album as containing sixteen \\"happy hardcore hardcore techno anthems\\" mixed together by Frolic, the songs themselves recorded by \\"a bunch of UK and maybe European acts.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20000307005644/http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~tewing/ned/n102.html Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic described the music as containing \\"ultra-fast bpms, accompanied by more than enough synth melodies to hum along to  or blow your rave whistle to,\\" while music critic Ned Raggett described the music on the album as being \\"as fast as gabber without being at all macho; the jungle breaks are ripping along, but even more hyperspeed hollow, with the songs carried as much by the bizarro keyboard squelches and quick bursts of semi-melody before everything suddenly speeds up all over again, and again and yet again. And then stops and starts and continues as it should and could and must always, while shreds of lyrics pop in and out and around and back again, as purely resistant of the dire lit crit model of music writing as any straight instrumental.\\" John Bush of AllMusic, acknowledging the album's usage of \\"anthems,\\" noted the album's inclusion of \\"classics\\" such as Eruption's \\"Let the Music\\", DJ Codeine & Unknown's \\"Feel the Power\\" and DNA's \\"Go Insane.\\" Specific points in the album noted by journalists include the introductory melody line from \\"Take On Me\\" by a-ha making a sudden appearance in the introduction of \\"I Believe\\" by DJ Stompy, the unnamed singer on \\"Here I Am\\" by DJ Ham, DJ Demo and Justin Time \\"suddenly [taking] off with the title line and the immediacy of the sheer moment of it all just brings it all home  while Chuck D yelping \\"Ah yeah, now that's progress\\" is reduced to a mere sped-up blip stuck in at the weirdest points, the tyranny of lyrical meaning implicitly quashed in the rush.\\" Release and promotion The yellow smiley is a symbol of rave music in the United Kingdom. Frolic described Moonshine Music's hopes for Happy 2B Hardcore as \\"modest,\\" seeing as the album was planned to be a standalone release. Moonshine promoted the album with posters and magazine advertisements and arranged for Frolic to appear on numerous radio stations, be interviewed by the media, and photographed by a publicist. \\"I was now plugged into their promotional machine,\\" he recalled. \\"My friend George turned to me and said 'I'll always remember you, Chris'.\\" The work he was asked to take to promote the album took Frolic by surprise: \\"Up until this point I was just a small DJ, playing small local raves, but certainly not on the level of doing international appearances and promotion. So it definitely felt like a whirlwind ride.\\" An official launch party for the album was held in Los Angeles, where Frolic played a rave he had promoted beforehand on the city's popular dance station Groove Radio. During his appearance on Groove Radio, he also played a live DJ mix in the studio. Moonshine Music released Happy 2b Hardcore on 21 January 1997 in the United States. The usage of yellow smileys on the record's album cover, described by Raggett as \\"nice big smiley faces [‚Ä¶] floating above a bunch of speaker cones,\\" highlight the rave aspect to the music, as the yellow smiley symbol had been used in the United Kingdom since the acid house era to represent rave music.The Independent, March 3, 1990: ‚ÄúAcid House, whose emblem is a vapid, anonymous smile, is the simplest and gentlest of the Eighties‚Äô youth manifestations ... non-aggressive (except in terms of decibels).‚Äù Anabolic Frolic recalled the album's striking album cover made it stand out in the \\"electronica\\" section of American record stores: \\"It‚Äôs no surprise it was an immediate hit.\\" Many customers purchased the album on a whim, and wrote to Frolic afterwards; in 2017, Frolic rhapsodised that it's \\"hard to think back to those days before MP3s and internet streaming, that often you just bought CDs in the store trying your luck and hoping you liked it.\\" Reception and legacy Upon its release, Happy 2b Hardcore was a surprise success, selling over 100,000 copies, which Frolic noted \\"which was an incredible number for obscure music.\\" He later said the album's success \\"emboldened\\" him: \\"I knew the audience was out there, but rave promoters at the time didn‚Äôt know how to book it inside their events.\\" As such, it inspired him to birth the successful Hullabaloo raves in June 1997 in order to cater for happy hardcore's American audience. Also as a result of the album's success, Moonshine and Frolic later released multiple sequels to the album, turning it into the first of a series; the first sequel, the similarly acclaimed Happy 2b Hardcore: Chapter Two, was released 9 September 1997. The series became a best-selling series. Happy 2b Hardcore was also released to critical acclaim. John Bush of AllMusic rated the album four and a half stars out of five and said it is \\"the best place for happy hardcore novices to begin as well as a great mix (by Slipmatt) for fans who already have most of the material.\\" He concluded that, \\"along with several volumes in the Now We're Totally Bonkers series, the collection is one of the best documents in happy hardcore's immense catalog.\\" In 2002, Billboard noted the album's release was a significant moment in the history of Moonshine, \\"documenting the underground sound of happy hardcore.\\" The album, along with other instalments in the series, later influenced happy hardcore producer one nut Chaos D. In 1999, Ned Raggett of Freaky Trigger ranked the album at number 102 in his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the 90s\\". He described it as a \\"perfectly sequenced and mixed compilation\\" and Frolic as \\"[blending] everything together just right\\": \\"it's not merely a great mix disc, it's just so goddamn fun and nuts that I can't understand why anyone would actually hate it, while realizing at the same why loads of people couldn't stand it.\\" He described the music as sounding \\"like it's mutating and growing and changing as you listen to it, and is so wonderful for it.\\" Track listing # Eruption ‚Äì \\"Reach Out\\" ‚Äì 2:27 # JDS ‚Äì \\"Higher Love\\" (Slipmatt Remix) ‚Äì 5:50 # DJ DNA ‚Äì \\"Go Insane (Future Primitive Remix)\\" ‚Äì 4:20 # DJ Codeine & Unknown ‚Äì \\"Feel the Power\\" ‚Äì 4:24 # Seduction & Dougal ‚Äì \\"It's Not Over (Remix)\\" ‚Äì 3:44 # DJ Hixxy & Bananaman ‚Äì \\"Forever\\" ‚Äì 4:10 # DJ Ham, DJ Demo & Justin Time ‚Äì \\"Here I Am\\" ‚Äì 4:08 # Eruption ‚Äì \\"Surrender\\" (Force & Styles Remix) ‚Äì 5:04 # DJ Ham ‚Äì \\"Here We Go Again\\" ‚Äì 3:46 # DJ Stompy ‚Äì \\"I Believe\\" ‚Äì 3:09 # Force & Styles ‚Äì \\"Heart of Gold\\" ‚Äì 4:12 # DJ Demo ‚Äì \\"Muzik\\" ‚Äì 4:01 # DJ Stompy ‚Äì \\"Dawn of a New Era\\" ‚Äì 4:34 # Eruption ‚Äì \\"Let the Music\\" (Brisk Remix) ‚Äì 4:44 # Scott Brown vs. DJ Rab-S ‚Äì \\"Now is the Time\\" (Hixxy & Trixxy Remix) ‚Äì 3:08 # Hixxy ‚Äì \\"Wanting to Get High\\" (Smoogies Awake) ‚Äì 4:24 See also *Happy hardcore References 1997 compilation albums DJ mix albums Happy hardcore music Breakbeat hardcore albums Dance music compilation albums ","title":"Happy 2b Hardcore"},{"id":"53480442","text":"Detective Barbie is a series of three mystery themed point and click adventure games starring the character Barbie.

Critical reception  = Detective Barbie In the Mystery of the Carnival Caper! = Richard Cobbett of PC Gamer thought the game had neither glitz nor glamour. SuperKids warned that \\"persistence, patience, and good directional abilities\\" were required to solve the case, instead of logic and deductive reasoning skills. Russian website 7Wolf wrote that the graphics were simple, but thought it was a good game for girls to unite around. Buzzfeed thought the best part of the game was its rides such as Tunnel of Love. = Detective Barbie 2: The Vacation Mystery = Superkids thought the game may be too difficult for young players, and recommended that people with short attention spans should stay away from it. The Boston Herald thought the game wasn't innovative but that it would still provide hours of entertainment, though it did describe the game as one of the \\"hottest new releases\\" in the children's interactive software space.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The building now houses the Little Traverse Historical Museum. History The Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad began service to Petoskey in 1874, and was the only railroad in the area. In 1891, a second railroad, the Chicago and West Michigan Railway, began constructing a line with attendant buildings, between Elk Rapids and Petoskey. The railway purchased this land on the shore of Little Traverse Bay to place their Petoskey Depot. The company hired the Cadillac firm of Mosser and Wilson to construct the depot, and both the rail line and depot were completed in 1892. The town of Petoskey then created a park (now Pioneer Park) surrounding the depot. In 1899, the Chicago and West Michigan Railway and this station was absorbed into the Pere Marquette Railway. The Pere Marquette, in turn, was merged into the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1947. The Petoskey station continued to serve passengers until the 1950s, when it was abandoned. IN 1970, the Little Traverse Regional Historical Society obtained a lease on the depot and some of the surrounding land. The building was converted into a museum in 1971, and as of 2017 is used as the Little Traverse Historical Museum Description The Chesapeake and Ohio Depot is located just on the edge of Little Traverse Bay. It is a distinctly Victorian Shingle style building with a distinct Victorian cast. The long building originally had open platforms at each end, but these were filled in during subsequent renovations. A porte cochere extends in the front of the building, and perching atop the building is a squat conical roof. Next to the conical section is a tall narrow chimney.

Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise, are East 169th Street to the north, Grand Concourse to the east, the Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line to the south, and Jerome Avenue to the west. The neighborhood is divided into three subsections: West Concourse, East Concourse, and Concourse Village. The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 4, and its ZIP Codes are 10451 and 10452. The local subway is the IND Concourse Line (), operating along the Grand Concourse, and the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (), operating along River Avenue. The area is patrolled by the NYPD's 44th Precinct.  Location  The neighborhood is in the South Bronx in the southwestern part of the borough, centered on the intersection of Grand Concourse and 161st Street. It is bordered to the west by Highbridge and the Harlem River; to the north by Mount Eden; to the east by Claremont Village, Melrose, and Morrisania; and to the south by Mott Haven. The neighborhoods follows a street grid with avenues crossing east/west streets. Retail is located on streets, and with the exception of Morris Avenue, the avenues are largely residential above 153rd Street. The neighborhood character is more industrialized along the river with the exception of park space and the Bronx Terminal Market. Other large retail nodes are located on 161st Street and adjacent blocks, at Concourse Plaza. Smaller retail nodes are located on 165th Street and on 167th Street. The elevation varies from sea level at the Harlem River short to its highest point of elevation of in Franz Sigel Park. In fact, George Washington and his troops utilized some of these elevations during the American Revolutionary War as vantage points to monitor activity along the Harlem River. Elevation can vary quickly with the Grand Concourse 20 feet higher than adjacent avenues in some instances.  History  = Early history = From European settlement through the late 1800s, the Concourse area occupied wooded lands and rocky formations within and on the periphery of the estate of the prominent Morris family who farmed in what is now Southwest Bronx. Until 1845, the area was part of the Town of Westchester within Westchester County. After the subdivision of the Town of Westchester in 1845, the Concourse area became part of the Town of West Farms. In 1855, West Farms was further subdivided and the Town of Morrisania was created. With the promise of city services, the Morrisania along with the Towns of West Farms and Kingsbridge seceded from Westchester County to join Manhattan as part of New York County. The three towns were referred to as the \\"Annexed District\\". In 1896, the vast majority of what is now the Bronx joined New York County. In 1898 the City of Greater New York and Borough of the Bronx were formed, and all former Westchester County annexations within New York County were reconstituted into the independent County of the Bronx in 1914. = 20th century = 161st Street in 1900 Expansion of the subway system enabled rapid development of the Concourse. The first subway crossed under 149th Street into the area in 1906 and is now the IRT White Plains Road Line (). The IRT Jerome Avenue Line opened a decade later in 1917 and spurred enormous development in the area. Concurrent with subway development and inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the New York City built the Grand Boulevard and Concourse (shortened to the Grand Concourse). Modeled after Paris‚Äô Champs-√âlys√©es, the original boulevard stretched from the Bronx Courthouse to near Van Cortlandt Park, but was later extended south to 138th Street by supplanting the existing Mott Avenue. The Grand Concourse was further improved by the extension of the IND Concourse Line () under most of its length in 1933. Yankee Stadium was built 1923 when Jacob Ruppert moved the team from the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, where the Yankees shared space with the New York Giants, to the Bronx. With the exception of a brief period in the 1970s, the Yankees have been in Concourse for almost 100 years. Infrastructure and services brought residents. Some of the 500,000 people who moved to the borough in the 1920s lived in the Concourse. The new construction to accommodate those residents was inspired by the City Beautiful movement and the 1901 Tenement House Act, which mandated light, air, and fire protection. This yielded 5- and 6- story multifamily residential buildings throughout the neighborhood built in a variety of styles from Tudor, Renaissance, and Colonial Revival to Art Deco and Art Moderne. In the late 1930s the Works Progress Administration dubbed the area ‚Äúthe Park Avenue for the Middle Class‚Äù, and the area maintained that reputation through the 1950s. The Concourse inspired visits by presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, and John F. Kennedy. However, after 1960, the area began to decline quickly due to white flight, incentives to move to the suburbs, redlining, the development of Co-Op City, disinvestment by New York City, and arson. While no buildings burned down in the Concourse during the period, the population of the area declined until the 1990s when the population started to rebound. = 21st century = View of both old and new Yankee Stadium Recent developments in the Concourse include construction and neighborhood improvements, and the neighborhood is gentrifying . The Yankees built a new stadium in 2009. The former stadium was demolished; a large public park‚ÄîHeritage Field‚Äîwas established in its place. The Bronx Museum of the Arts undertook a major expansion in 2006, and is currently exploring another addition. The Bronx Hall of Justice opened in 2007. The Bronx Terminal Market opened in 2009 as did the adjacent Mill Pond Park, which includes a Stadium Tennis Center. In the 2000s, the New York City Department of Transportation started making capital, aesthetic, and safety improvements to the Grand Concourse with much of the work completed within the Concourse neighborhood. A redesign of 161st Street during the 2000 reconstruction of the Grand Concourse brought additional pedestrian space to the neighborhood. In 2011, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated a large portion of the neighborhood as the Grand Concourse Historic District. In 2016, the New York City Economic Development Corporation issued requests for proposals for a new redevelopment project in the Concourse, along the Harlem River shore. A $300 million proposal, announced in September 2017, includes 1,045 affordable housing units as well as a new Universal Hip Hop Museum that is to open in 2020. The first of two phases will have 600 affordable unites, a waterfront promenade, a public plaza, a performance space, a movie theater, and the hip hop museum.

The paper has a fortnightly circulation of around 1,000 available to students and staff at the university during term-time, covering news and sport on campus, as well as comment pieces, features, lifestyle and arts coverage. It also publishes content online. In 2020-21 the appointed editors are Joshua Talbot (Editor-in-Chief), Georgia-may Keetch (Online Production Editor), and Ellie Doughty (Print Production Editor). The paper used to run as a weekly publication from its inception until 2017 and is the only print and online newspaper that serves the University of Sussex. It is one of five student media outlets at the University, alongside the student TV station - UniTV, URF - the student radio station, The Channel - the student arts magazine, Fabrik - the student fashion magazine. History The Badger began in October 1995, having formerly been known as Unionews since the 1970s. The paper has since covered a variety of stories, including several on-campus occupations and the expulsion of five Sussex students for involvement in protests. The Newspaper was embroiled in a scandal in 2015 when its own students' union seized copies of the newspaper and prevented them from being distributed, which also forced the then editor to resign. The University of Sussex Students' Union claimed the papers were seized due to the potential for legal action against them. This stemmed from an article written about legal action taken by a student against the University.

PRAC (Probabilistic Action Cores) is an interpreter for natural- language instructions for robotic applications developed at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen, Germany, and is supported in parts by the European Commission and the German Research Foundation (DFG).  Goals  The ultimate goal of the PRAC system is to make knowledge about everyday activities from websites like wikiHow available for service robots, such that they can autonomously acquire new high-level skills by browsing the Web. PRAC addresses the problem that natural language is inherently vague and unspecific. To this end, PRAC maintains probabilistic first-order knowledge bases over semantic networks represented in Markov logic networks. As opposed to other semantic learning initiatives like NELL or IBM's Watson, PRAC does not aim at answering questions in natural language, but to disambiguate and infer information pieces that are missing in natural-language instructions, such that they can be executed by a robot. \\"This problem formulation is substantially different to the problem of text understanding for question answering or machine translation. In those reasoning tasks, the vagueness and ambiguity of natural-language expressions can often be kept and translated into other languages. In contrast, robotic agents have to infer missing information pieces and disambiguate the meaning of the instruction in order to perform the instruction successfully.\\" In addition to probabilistic relational models, PRAC uses the principles of analogical reasoning and instance-based learning to infer completions of roles in semantic networks. PRAC has been successfully applied to teach robots to conduct chemical experiments and to make pancakes and pizza from wikiHow articles.

The strategic aim of Great Britain was to avoid Denmark allying itself with France. In 1733 Richard Bentley, Master of Trinity College, appointed him to the college's physic fellowship; Titley resigned his diplomatic position to accept it, but did in the end did not move from Copenhagen. He resumed his post, and held it for the remainder of his life. During his time there, two Hanoverian princesses married into the Danish royal family. On Titley's application to Frederick V of Denmark in 1761, the king agreed to order the seizure and extradition of British deserters from the British army and navy, on condition of a similar service being performed for him in England. Two years later, in 1763, Titley was, on the ground of age and infirmity, granted an assistant. Titley died at Copenhagen in February 1768. He left ¬£1,000 each to Westminster School and Trinity College, and ¬£500 to the University of Cambridge. Part of the last bequest was to be devoted to buildings. Works Titley wrote an Imitation in English of an ode of Horace (second ode of the third book of Horace), admired by Bentley who parodied it. Both poems and in James Henry Monk's Life of Bentley.

Several watercourses run through the property, including Coongan River, Emu, Sandy, and Badgeyong Creeks, which also contain several permanent pools of water. The landscape is mostly flat spinifex country. The lease was first taken up by John Withnell and William McLean in July 1886. The Mackay brothers, along with Donald and Roderick Louden, took up a holding in 1887. The Mackays' lease consisted of three parcels of each. In 1890, George Dudley and Alfred Howden Drake-Brockman took up land on what is now Mount Edgar Station. Howden selected the Corunna Downs land and named it after the Battle of Corunna. The leases of the Withnells and Mackays were registered to Dalgety & Company and worked by the Brockman brothers. In 1916 the property produced over 147 bales of wool, and 105 were produced in 1920. The property was made up of 13 separate leases that were combined into a single lease in 1924 when it was acquired by Ernest Samuel Foulkes-Taylor. Taylor had previously held Glenorn Station, near Malcolm, with his younger brother Charlie. In 1924 Corunna Downs was still a fully operational sheep station carrying 20,000 head of sheep, 350 cattle, 125 horses, 175 donkeys and 8 camels.

The official investigation concluded that the aircraft was improperly loaded. Accident At 18:00 local time the Tu-104 lined up on runway 21 and commenced its take-off run during snowing weather conditions. After rotation the aircraft pitched up beyond normal take off attitude and eight seconds after lift off, at an altitude above ground level (AGL) of 50 meters the Tupolev stalled and entered a right bank. The aircraft continued to roll right until it struck the ground 20 meters from the departure end of the runway, crashing nearly inverted and bursting into flames, killing 49 of the 50 people on board. One person who was in the cockpit was ejected from the nose of the aircraft and was found alive in the snow not far from the crash site but died on the way to a hospital. Aircraft The Tupolev Tu-104A involved was serial number 76600402 and registered as CCCP-42332 to the Soviet Navy. The construction of the airliner was completed on 26 November 1957. Investigation The investigation of the accident revealed that the crew allowed the aircraft to be improperly loaded. Evidence was uncovered that led investigators to believe that some military officers did not comply with seating assignments given by the crew and that these officers pressured the crew to make the flight in an unsafely loaded aircraft.

Casualties Memorial in the Serafimovskoe Cemetery, St Petersburg to those who died in the 1981 crash The Tupolev Tu-10A was carrying many of the Pacific Fleet's senior officers from Leningrad, where they had been attending meetings with the naval command, to Vladivostok, via Khabarovsk. Among the dead were 16 admirals and generals, including the commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Emil Spiridonov and his wife. They were both interred with most of the other victims of the crash in the Serafimovskoe Cemetery in Leningrad, where a memorial to the dead was erected on the orders of the Navy's Commander-in- Chief, Sergey Gorshkov.

It is listed Grade I for its architectural, historical and topographical value. It originally served the village of Wenden Magna (Great Wenden), which was merged with Wenden Parva (Little Wenden) to form Wendens Ambo in 1662. Architecture The building consists of a chancel with organ chamber, an aisled nave, a south porch and a tower surmounted by a Hertfordshire spike. The vestry in the western end of the south aisle, is unusually positioned. =Tower= The oldest part of the structure is the 11th century tower. It is usually described as Norman. However, it could be pre- Conquest on the basis of a series of round window openings, like portholes: these small openings are found in Anglo-Saxon architecture and are sometimes called 'sound holes' although there actual function is unclear. The ones at Wendens Ambo are similar to late Saxon windows in St Bene't's church in Cambridge. History The first church on the site was probably constructed of wood, perhaps as early as the eighth century, but no trace of it remains. It seems to have been rebuilt in stone about the time Domesday Book was written (1086 A.D.) with later additions in the 13th, 14th, 15th and 19th centuries. The church register of Great Wenden commenced in 1540. After Volume II, which was the register of Little Wenden until 1662, the two parishes were united as Wendens Ambo. =Churchyard and hall= In the 19th century Lord Braybrooke gifted land and a hall neighbouring the church to enable an extension to the ancient churchyard. The hall was extensively modernised in 2007 and under lease to the Village Hall, is managed for use by a variety of active village interest groups and activities.

Sailing handicap standards exist internationally, nationally, and within individual sailing clubs. Typically sailing vessel classes are defined by measurement rules, which categorise vessels accordingly into classes of vessels, and vessels compete within their class. Handicapping allows vessels to compete across classes, and also allows vessels and crews to compete based on performance and equipment on an equal basis, by adjusting the race outcome data, to declare a handicap (adjusted) winner as distinct from a line honours (first over the finish line) winner. For some national, international, and other yacht racing events, rules such as those of the International Racing Certificate known as the International Measurement System (IMS) or the Sportsboat rule (SBR) may be specified. Others exist in different countries. Other handicap systems of a simplified measurement type are designed to allow very different yachts of diverse designs to compete on an equal basis. This is particularly so for trailer sailers that may race in trailer sailer fleets or in mixed fleets. For example, Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF), Class Based Handicap (CBH), and Yardstick which is based more on previous individual performances rather than vessel design characteristics. Forms of sailing handicapping =Class Based Handicap= Class Based Handicap (CBH) measurement system is used, for example, for trailer sailers, such as in Australia and also in New Zealand. In Australia, the CBH system is a nationally governed handicap designed to assess the potential speed of the boat. It does not take into account the experience of the crew. Vessels are given a rating number based on a set of measurements. It represents a very well sailed boat kept in top racing condition, that is the boat at minimum weight, good sails, fair hull. =Yardstick= Rather than a vessel measurement rule, Yardstick as in Portsmouth Yardstick is used in the UK is a way of rating different classes of trailer yachts relative to each other. These are adjusted annually at a state or regional level. At a club level, starting from a CBH or Yardstick rating a Performance Based Handicap or PBH may be used, such as PBH. This attempts to measure the relative performance of a particular yacht and crew against other yachts and crews either of the same type of other type. Clubs will often run an event or season championship based only upon a CBH rating together with a handicap winner based upon a regularly adjusted PBH figure for each yacht and crew. In theory the PBH which is adjusted after each race gives each boat an equal chance of winning each race. =Performance Handicap Racing Fleet= Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) is a handicapping system used for yacht racing in North America. It allows dissimilar classes of sailboats to be raced against each other. The aim is to cancel out the inherent advantages and disadvantages of each class of boats, so that results reflect crew skill rather than equipment superiority. PHRF is used mainly for larger sailboats (i.e., 7 meters and above). For dinghy racing, the Portsmouth yardstick handicapping system is more likely to be used. The handicap number assigned to a class of yachts is based on the yacht's speed relative to a theoretical yacht with a rating of 0. A yacht's handicap, or rating, is the number of seconds per mile traveled that the yacht in question should be behind the theoretical yacht. Most boats have a positive PHRF rating, but some very fast boats have a negative PHRF rating. If Boat A has a PHRF rating of 15 and Boat B has a rating of 30 and they compete on a 1-mile course, Boat A should finish approximately 15 seconds in front of Boat B. Results are adjusted for handicap by the race committee after all competitors have finished. Each region has its own variation on PHRF rules and ratings, based on local conditions. In some countries a Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) may be used to rate trailer sailers, such as in NZ and in the USA and Canada. International rule The International rule, also known as the Metre rule, was created for the measuring and rating of yachts to allow different designs of yacht to race together under a handicap system. Prior to the ratification of the International rule in 1907, countries raced yachts under their own national rules and international competition was always subject to various forms of subjective handicapping. History During the early part of the 19th century interest in yacht racing had achieved sufficient momentum to need an agreed handicapping system to allow different types of yacht to race on an equitable basis. The method of measuring merchant sailing ships carried over into the world of yacht racing so that a yacht also now had a measured tonnage which allowed size comparisons and hence performance comparisons to be made between yachts on the basis that a properly designed big yacht will sail faster than a properly designed small yacht. Each yacht fell within a Class based upon its measured tonnage. In the early 19th century four ranges of tonnage and hence four Classes were defined. Based on experience gained from the results of numerous races each Class was allocated a distance allowance that the Class had to give away to the next lower Class. This was equivalent to a Class 1 having to sail more distance than a Class 4 yacht during a race. In 1834 handicapping by distance was changed to handicapping by time. As yacht racing in particular became more and more popular designers started to look for and found loopholes in the measurement rules to enable a design to get a better rating. Whilst this encouraged designers it discouraged owners from participating in handicap racing because designs were being outdated almost before the yacht was launched. In order to restore the equilibrium, work began on new formulas, which resulted, in the Thames Measurement which was the first formula defined for yachts. The adoption of the British Thames Measurement by the Yacht Club of France in 1870 may mark the beginning of international rating rules. In 1893, the Germano- Scandinavian Union was formed and it developed its \\"Union Rule\\". Starting in 1902, under the leadership of the New York Yacht Club, U.S. yacht clubs agreed to a Universal Rule in 1905 which was based on a formula developed by Nathanael Herreshoff. The Universal Rule determined a yacht's eligibility to race in the America's Cup from 1914 to 1937 and for this the J-class was chosen. Boats built according to the rule reached their peak in the large J-class yachts. This Rating Rule is intended to calculate a rating for yachts, which can then be used to calculate its Time Correction Factor (T.C.F.) in order to have disparate yachts racing against each other. The International Offshore Rule (IOR) was a measurement rule for racing sailboats. The IOR evolved from the Cruising Club of America (CCA) rule for racer/cruisers and the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) rule. The IOR concentrated on hull shape with length, beam, freeboard and girth measurements, foretriangle, mast and boom measurements, and stability with an inclination test. Additionally, the IOR identified features which were dangerous, or it couldn't fairly rate, and penalized or prohibited them. The measurements and penalties were used to compute the handicap number, called an IOR rating, in feet. The higher the rating, the faster the boat was deemed to be able to sail. The IOR was superseded (in the early 1990s) by the International Measurement System (IMS) and CHS (since renamed IRC). While some IOR yachts race at club level under IRC in more or less their original form, others had major surgery to make them competitive within the new rules.Seashore Magazine February 98 In the United States, the most common handicapping rule is the PHRF rule, developed and promoted by the United States Sailing Association. While most other rules do not take past performance into account, PHRF differentiates itself by allowing skippers to request handicap reductions after a series of poor racing results. In Europe, the most common handicapping system used today is the IRC rule. Velocity prediction program Velocity prediction program (VPP)s are used by a variety of sailing organizations to assess theoretical boat performance and then assign \\"handicaps\\" to allow boats of different styles and sizes to race against one another. The IOR and IMS handicapping rules were some of the earliest adopters of VPPs.

A handicap race in horse racing is a race in which horses carry different weights, allocated by the handicapper. A better horse will carry a heavier weight, to give it a disadvantage when racing against slower horses. The skill in betting on a handicap race lies in predicting which horse can overcome its handicap. British Horseracing Authority. Accessed February 5, 2011. Although most handicap races are run for older, less valuable horses, this is not true in all cases; some great races are handicaps, such as the Grand National steeplechase in England and the Melbourne Cup in Australia. In the United States over 30 handicap races are classified as Grade I, the top level of the North American grading system. Handicapping in action In a horse handicap race (sometimes called just \\"handicap\\"), each horse must carry a specified weight called the impost, assigned by the racing secretary or steward based on factors such as past performances, so as to equalize the chances of the competitors. To supplement the combined weight of jockey and saddle, up to the assigned impost, lead weights are carried in saddle pads with pockets, called lead pads. The weight-for-age scale was introduced by Admiral Rous, a steward of the Jockey Club. In 1855 he was appointed public handicapper. In Britain the horses are assigned weights according to a centralised rating system maintained by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA). Weights may be increased if a horse wins a race between the publication of the weights and the running of the contest. =Predicting the outcome of races= Thoroughbred handicapping (in the USA) is the art of predicting horses who have the greatest chance of winning a race, and profiting from these predictions at the horse races. The Daily Racing Form (DRF), a newspaper-style publication, is an important tool of the handicapper or horseplayer. The DRF details statistical information about each horse entered in a race, including detailed past performance results, lifetime records, amount of money earned, odds for the particular horse in each past race, and myriad other information available for casual or serious study. The handicapping process can be simple or complex but usually includes the following elements prior to the race: *Study of the Daily Racing Form. *Observing the horses‚Äô body language and behaviour in the paddock and/or post parade. *Watching the tote board for the changing odds of each horse and thus for clues about how the betting public views a horse's chances of winning the upcoming race ‚ÄúTrip handicapping‚Äù takes place during the race and involves watching the horses (usually with binoculars) and noting relevant information about how a horse runs during that race. Handicapping theory is possibly one of the most enigmatic theories in all of sports. Horseplayers consider the following elements when handicapping a horse race: ;Speed: The DRF lists times at certain call points of each race, and the lengths back from the lead at each call point. Speed handicappers compare race times to help ascertain which horses will most likely win the race. The DRF contains a numerical summation of the speed that each horse ran in every race, called a Beyer speed figure. This number is generated through a method developed by Andrew Beyer, and described in his 1975 book Picking Winners. The Beyer speed figures takes into account the individual class of a race as well as how the racetrack was playing on a particular day to create an aggregate number for each horse. ;Pace: Pace handicappers classify each horse's running style (i.e. front runner, stalker, presser, closer) and then find contenders based on the predicted pace of today's race. The difficulty is that the jockey has control over where a horse is placed in a race and how fast that race goes in the early stages. This takes the prediction of pace for a given race out of the realm of mathematics and into the realm of mere speculation. Until the 1970s, for pace handicapping purposes, the time generally allotted by pace handicappers for a horse to run a length (approximately 11 feet) during the course of a race was long thought to be a fifth of a second. Andrew Beyer was the first to contest this in his 1975 book Picking Winners, stating that the time span of a beaten length (at the end of the race) varied by race distance, as horses would be traveling faster at the end of shorter distanced races than they would at longer ones. Others, particularly devotees of the Sartain Methodology in the 1980s, furthered this principle to include fractional (internal race) times. Today, the value of a beaten length is generally accepted to be closer to 0.16 seconds than to 0.20. The standard of one-fifth of a second is somewhat valid in Standardbred (harness) racing. ;Form: A \\"sharp\\" horse could have finished strongly, stayed among the leaders, finished ‚Äúin the money‚Äù (1st, 2nd or 3rd) or recovered from a bad racing trip. Conversely, a horse showed dull form if it gave up, looked sluggish or chased the pack. Horses with sharp form have the lowest odds and hence return the least money per bet. Also, often horses will race off a \\"layoff.\\" A layoff is a rest varying in length from usually two months to a year or more. In this case, workouts, horse appearance, and trainer patterns are the best guides to whether the horse is ready to run after a rest. ;Class: Horse races occur at different levels of competition. Generally, high caliber horses are entered in races with other high caliber horses and slower horses are entered in races with other slower horses. But a horse can move up or down in class, depending on where the trainer decided to enter the horse based on the results of its last race. Note that the strength of the same class of race, such as a Maiden Special Weight race, will vary greatly from track to track, as well as from race to race at the same track, making this too an inexact determinant of class. ;Post-position or draw: The horse nearer the inside of a race track will have a shorter distance to run than a horse on the outside track, although it is also more vulnerable to being cut off by horses that start off faster and head to the inside rail. ;Jockey: A better jockey can make a difference between a winning horse and one that loses. ;Other factors: Other factors affecting the outcome of a race are track condition, weather, weight that the horses have to carry, daily bias of the racing surface, and many more factors that the handicapper cannot know. The track condition is closely linked to the weather as rain/snow and the amount of sun affect the firmness of the turf or the condition of the dirt. A wet track is usually denoted as \\"sloppy\\". There are cases however when a roller is run over a wet track (if the rain has stopped) and such a track is denoted \\"sealed\\". It is difficult to measure some factors with data.

In 1566, he was promoted to the Grand Secretariat of Wenyuan Chamber with recommendation from Xu Jie. After the enthronement of the Longqing Emperor, Gao's higher status catalyzed a sudden escalation of antagonism between Gao and Xu. Impeached by several censors, he was forced to retire in 1567. Zhang Juzheng did his utmost to persuade the emperor to recall Gao for political reasons. Thus, Gao returned to Beijing in 1569. He replaced Li Chunfang, the former Senior Grand Secretary, who was defeated in the political struggle by the death of the emperor. Zhang was hostile to him afterwards. The eunuchs in the Directorate of Ceremonial headed by Feng Bao brooked no weakening of their power by Gao. Hence, an alignment grew up between Zhang and Feng aimed at marginalizing Gao. They criticized Gao before Empress Dowager Xiaoding. Gao had to retire and return home once again. He finished the memoir Bingta yiyan () [The last words left on my sickbed] in his later years. In 1578, Gao died at home. Although Gao's term was quite brief, he made great efforts with Zhang to subsume Altan Khan's Tumed into the tributary system.
