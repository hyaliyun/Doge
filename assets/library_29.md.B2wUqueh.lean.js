Etymology A breadcrumb-based recipe given by Mrs Beeton References to \\"Bakewell pudding\\" appear earlier than the term \\"Bakewell tart\\", which entered common usage in the 20th century. In the Oxford Companion to Food by Alan Davidson, it is claimed the earliest reference to \\"Bakewell pudding\\" comes from The Cook and Housewife's Manual by Margaret Dods, published in 1826. This is, however, erroneous as no recipe for \\"Bakewell pudding\\" (or indeed Bakewell tart) appears in the 1826 edition. A recipe for \\"bakewell pudding\\" does, however, appear in the 1847 edition. History Three shops in Bakewell claim to own the original recipe of the Bakewell pudding. The pudding originated in the Derbyshire town of Bakewell. The origins of the pudding are not clear, but a common story is that it was first made by accident in 1820 (other sources cite 1860) by Mrs Greaves, who was the landlady of the White Horse Inn (since demolished). She supposedly left instructions for her cook to make a jam tart. The cook, instead of stirring the eggs and almond paste mixture into the pastry, spread it on top of the jam. When cooked, the egg and almond paste set like an egg custard, and the result was successful enough for it to become a popular dish at the inn. The dates and/or premises given in this story are unlikely to be accurate as the White Horse Inn was demolished in 1803 to make way for the development of Rutland Square and subsequently the Rutland Arms Hotel. Additionally, Eliza Acton provides a recipe for 'Bakewell pudding' in her book Modern Cookery for Private Families which was published in 1845, making the pudding's creation date of 1860 impossible. One of the earliest verifiable examples of a Bakewell pudding recipe comes from The Magazine of Domestic Economy issued in London in 1836. Eliza Acton published a recipe in her 1845 work Modern Cookery for Private Families and Mrs Beeton published two recipes for Bakewell pudding, one which used a pastry base and one which used breadcrumbs, in her Book of Household Management in 1861.

The group consisted of approximately 50 of his followers who lived an unconventional lifestyle with habitual use of hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD. Most of the group members were young women from middle-class backgrounds, many of whom were radicalized by Manson's teachings and drawn by hippie culture and communal living. Manson was released from prison for petty crimes in 1967, and the Family moved to San Francisco and later to a deserted ranch in the San Fernando Valley. According to group member Susan Atkins, the Family believed that Manson was a manifestation of Jesus Christ and that his prophecies were reliable concerning an imminent, apocalyptic race war. They gained international attention after the murder of Sharon Tate and four others in 1969. The murders were committed by Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel. Linda Kasabian was also present, but did not take part. Group members were also responsible for a number of other murders, assaults, petty crimes, and thefts.  Formation  San Francisco followers Following his release from prison on March 21, 1967, Charles Manson moved to San Francisco, where, with the help of a prison acquaintance, he moved instead into an apartment in Berkeley. In prison, bank robber Alvin Karpis had taught Manson to play the steel guitar.Bugliosi, Vincent with Gentry, Curt. Helter Skelter — The True Story of the Manson Murders 25th Anniversary Edition, W.W. Norton & Company, 1994. , .Emmons, Nuel. Manson in His Own Words. Grove Press, New York (1988); Karpis, Alvin, with Robert Livesey. On the Rock: Twenty-five Years at Alcatraz, 1980 Living mostly by begging, Manson soon became acquainted with Mary Brunner, a 23-year- old graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Brunner was working as a library assistant at the University of California, Berkeley, and Manson moved in with her. According to a second-hand account, he overcame her resistance to his bringing other women in to live with them. Before long, they were sharing Brunner's residence with eighteen other women. Manson established himself as a guru in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, which during 1967's \\"Summer of Love\\" was emerging as the signature hippie locale. Manson appeared to have borrowed his philosophy from the Process Church of the Final Judgment, whose members believed Satan would become reconciled to Christ and they would come together at the end of the world to judge humanity. Manson soon had the first of his groups of followers, which have been called the \\"Manson Family\\", most of them female. Manson taught his followers that they were the reincarnation of the original Christians, and that the Romans were the establishment. He strongly implied that he was Christ; he often told a story envisioning himself on the cross with the nails in his feet and hands. Sometime around 1967, he began using the alias \\"Charles Willis Manson.\\" He often said it very slowly (\\"Charles's Will Is Man's Son\\")—implying that his will was the same as that of the Son of Man. Before the end of the summer, Manson and eight or nine of his enthusiasts piled into an old school bus they had re-wrought in hippie style, with colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed. They roamed as far north as Washington state, then southward through Los Angeles, Mexico, and the American Southwest. Returning to the Los Angeles area, they lived in Topanga Canyon, Malibu, and Venice—western parts of the city and county.Sanders, Ed (2002). The Family. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press. . Pages 13–20. In 1967, Brunner became pregnant by Manson and, on April 15, 1968, gave birth to a son she named Valentine Michael in a condemned house in Topanga Canyon, assisted during the birth by several of the young women from the Family. Brunner (like most members of the group) acquired a number of aliases and nicknames, including: \\"Marioche\\", \\"Och\\", \\"Mother Mary\\", \\"Mary Manson\\", \\"Linda Dee Manson\\" and \\"Christine Marie Euchts\\".Bugliosi, Vincent: Helter Skelter, 1974. pg. xv.  Manson's presentation of himself  Actor Al Lewis had Manson babysit his children on a couple of occasions and described him as \\"a nice guy when I knew him\\".Charles Manson by Simon Wells Producer Phil Kaufman introduced Manson to young Universal Studios producer Gary Stromberg, then working on a film adaptation of the life of Jesus set in modern America, featuring a black Jesus and southern \\"redneck Romans\\". Stromberg thought that Manson made interesting suggestions about what Jesus might do in a situation, seeming to be attuned to the role. He had one of his women kiss his feet and then kissed hers in return to demonstrate the place of women. At the beach one day, Stromberg watched while Manson preached against a materialistic outlook, only to be questioned about his well-furnished bus. He casually tossed the bus keys to the doubter, who promptly drove it away while Manson watched, apparently unconcerned.Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson. By Jeff Guinn. p. 124. According to Stromberg, Manson had a dynamic personality with an ability to read a person's weaknesses and manipulate them. For example, Manson tried to manipulate an influential member of a motorcycle gang by granting him access to Family women; he then convinced the biker that it was the biker's large penis which kept the women in the group.  Involvement with Wilson, Melcher, and others  Dennis Wilson with the Beach Boys in late 1966 Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys picked up Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey when they were hitchhiking in late spring 1968, while under the influence of alcohol and LSD,\\"The Six Degrees of Helter Skelter\\", 2009 Documentary and brought them to his Pacific Palisades house for a few hours. He returned home in the early hours of the following morning from a night recording session and was greeted by Manson in the driveway, who emerged from the house. Wilson asked the stranger whether he intended to hurt him. Manson assured him that he had no such intent and began kissing Wilson's feet.Sanders 2002, p. 34. Inside the house, Wilson discovered 12 strangers, mostly women. The account given in Manson in His Own Words is that Manson first met Wilson at a friend's San Francisco house where Manson had gone to obtain marijuana. Manson claimed that Wilson gave him his Sunset Boulevard address and invited him to stop by when he came to Los Angeles. Wilson said in a 1968 Record Mirror article that he mentioned the Beach Boys' involvement with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi to a group of strange women, and \\"they told me they too had a guru, a guy named Charlie.\\" The number of women doubled in Wilson's house over the next few months, and they cost him approximately $100,000 by making themselves part of his household. This included a large medical bill for treatment of their gonorrhea and $21,000 for the destruction of his uninsured car which they borrowed.Watkins, Paul with Soledad, Guillermo (1979). My Life with Charles Manson, Bantam. . Chapter 4. Wilson would sing and talk with Manson, while the women were treated as servants to them both. Wilson paid for studio time to record songs written and performed by Manson, and introduced him to entertainment business acquaintances including Gregg Jakobson, Terry Melcher, and Rudi Altobelli, who owned a house which he rented to actress Sharon Tate and her husband Roman Polanski. Jakobson was impressed by \\"the whole Charlie Manson package\\" of artist, life-stylist, and philosopher, and he paid to record his material. Wilson moved out of his rented home when the lease expired, and his landlord evicted the Family.  Spahn Ranch  Manson established a base for the Family at the Spahn Ranch in August 1968 after Wilson's landlord evicted them.The Story of the Abandoned Movie Ranch Where the Manson Family Launched Helter Skelter. Retrieved March 10, 2016. It had been a television and movie set for Westerns, but the buildings had deteriorated by the late 1960s and the ranch's revenue was primarily derived from selling horseback rides. Female Family members did chores around the ranch and, occasionally, had sex on Manson's orders with the nearly blind 80 year-old owner George Spahn. The women also acted as seeing- eye guides for him. In exchange, Spahn allowed Manson and his group to live at the ranch for free.Watkins, pages 34 & 40. Lynette Fromme acquired the nickname \\"Squeaky\\" because she often squeaked when Spahn pinched her thigh. Charles Watson, a small-town Texan who had quit college and moved to California, soon joined the group at the ranch. He met Manson at Wilson's house; Watson had given Wilson a ride while Wilson was hitchhiking after his car was wrecked. Spahn nicknamed him \\"Tex\\" because of his pronounced Texas drawl.  Helter Skelter  In the first days of November 1968, Manson established the Family at alternative headquarters in Death Valley's environs, where they occupied two unused or little-used ranches, Myers and Barker.Watkins, Ch. 10. The former, to which the group had initially headed, was owned by the grandmother of a new woman (Catherine Gillies) in the Family. The latter was owned by an elderly local woman (Arlene Barker) to whom Manson presented himself and a male Family member as musicians in need of a place congenial to their work. When the woman agreed to let them stay if they'd fix things up, Manson honored her with one of the Beach Boys' gold records, several of which he had been given by Wilson.Watkins, Ch. 11 While back at Spahn Ranch, no later than December, Manson and Watson visited a Topanga Canyon acquaintance who played them the Beatles' recently released double album, The Beatles (also known as the \\"White Album\\").Watkins, Ch. 12 Manson became obsessed with the group. Manson's obsession with the Beatles is discussed at the interview's very end. At McNeil Island prison, Manson had told fellow inmates, including Karpis, that he could surpass the group in fame;Sanders 2002, 11. to the Family, he spoke of the group as \\"the soul\\" and \\"part of the hole in the infinite\\". For some time, Manson had been saying that racial tensions between blacks and whites were about to erupt, predicting that blacks would rise up in rebellion in America's cities.The Influence of the Beatles on Charles Manson . UMKC Law. Retrieved April 7, 2006. On a bitterly cold New Year's Eve at Myers Ranch, as the Family gathered outside around a large fire, Manson explained that the social turmoil he had been predicting had also been predicted by the Beatles. The White Album songs, he declared, foretold it all in code. In fact, he maintained (or would soon maintain), the album was directed at the Family, an elect group that was being instructed to preserve the worthy from the impending disaster. In early January 1969, the Family left the desert's cold and moved to a canary-yellow home in Canoga Park, not far from the Spahn Ranch.Sanders 2002, 99–100. Because this locale would allow the group to remain \\"submerged beneath the awareness of the outside world\\",Watkins, p. 137. Manson called it the Yellow Submarine, another Beatles reference. There, Family members prepared for the impending apocalypse, which around the campfire Manson had termed \\"Helter Skelter\\", after the song of that name. By February, Manson's vision was complete. The Family would create an album whose songs, as subtle as those of the Beatles, would trigger the predicted chaos. Ghastly murders of whites by blacks would be met with retaliation, and a split between racist and non-racist whites would yield whites' self-annihilation. The blacks' triumph, as it were, would merely precede their being ruled by the Family, which would ride out the conflict in \\"the bottomless pit\\", a secret city beneath Death Valley.Testimony of Paul Watkins in the Charles Manson Trial UMKC Law. Retrieved April 7, 2007. At the Canoga Park house, while Family members worked on vehicles and pored over maps to prepare for their desert escape, they also worked on songs for their world-changing album. When they were told Melcher was to come to the house to hear the material, the women prepared a meal and cleaned the place. However, Melcher never arrived.Watkins, Ch. 13  Alternative theories  There are alternative theories to the Helter Skelter scenario and whether or not it was the actual motive behind the murders. According to Family associate Bobby Beausoleil, it was actually Beausoleil's arrest for the torture and murder of Gary Hinman that instigated the Family's ensuing murder spree—enacted to convince police that the killer(s) of Hinman were in fact still at large. This has been substantiated by interviews of Beausoleil by Truman Capote, and by Ann Louise Bardach in 1981.Jailhouse Interview: Bobby Beausoleil by Ann Louise Bardach Retrieved March 10, 2016.  Encounter with Tate  Sharon Tate in 1967. Manson entered 10050 Cielo Drive uninvited on March 23, 1969, which he had known as Melcher's residence. This was Altobelli's property; Melcher was only a previous tenant, and the tenants were now Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. Manson was met by Shahrokh Hatami, an Iranian photographer who befriended Polanski and Tate during the making of the documentary Mia and Roman. He was there to photograph Tate before her departure for Rome the next day. He had seen Manson through a window as he approached the main house and had gone onto the front porch to ask him what he wanted. Manson told him that he was looking for someone whose name Hatami did not recognize, and Hatami informed him that the place was the Polanski residence. He advised Manson to try \\"the back alley,\\" by which he meant the path to the guest house beyond the main house. He was concerned about the stranger on the property and went down to the front walk to confront Manson. Tate then appeared behind Hatami in the house's front door and asked him who was calling. Hatami said that a man was looking for someone. He and Tate maintained their positions while Manson went back to the guest house without a word, returned a minute or two later, and left. That evening, Manson returned to the property and again went back to the guest house. He entered the enclosed porch and spoke with Altobelli, who was just coming out of the shower. Manson asked for Melcher, but Altobelli felt that Manson had come looking for him. This is consistent with prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi's later discovery that Manson had apparently been to the property on earlier occasions after Melcher's departure from it. Altobelli told Manson through the screen door that Melcher had moved to Malibu, falsely stating that he did not know his new address. Altobelli said that he was in the entertainment business, although he had met Manson the previous year at Wilson's home and he was sure that Manson already knew that. He had complimented Manson lukewarmly on some of his musical recordings that Wilson had been playing. He then informed Manson that he was going out of the country the next day, and Manson said that he would like to speak with him upon his return; Altobelli lied that he would be gone for more than a year. Manson explained that he had been directed to the guest house by the persons in the main house; Altobelli expressed the wish that Manson would not disturb his tenants. Manson left. Altobelli flew with Tate to Rome the next day, and Tate asked him whether \\"that creepy-looking guy\\" had gone back to the guest house the day before.  Crimes   Crowe shooting  \\\\> }} On May 18, 1969, Terry Melcher visited Spahn Ranch to hear Manson and the women sing. Melcher arranged a subsequent visit, not long thereafter, during which he brought a friend who possessed a mobile recording unit, but Melcher did not record the group.Sanders 2002, 133–36. By June, Manson was telling the Family they might have to show blacks how to start \\"Helter Skelter\\".Watkins, Ch. 15 When Manson tasked Watson with obtaining money, supposedly intended to help the Family prepare for the conflict, Watson defrauded a black drug dealer named Bernard \\"Lotsapoppa\\" Crowe. Crowe responded with a threat to wipe out everyone at Spahn Ranch. The family countered on July 1, 1969, by shooting Crowe at Manson's Hollywood apartment.Sanders 2002, 147–49. Manson's belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a Black Panther in Los Angeles. Although Crowe was not a member of the Black Panthers, Manson concluded he had been and expected retaliation from the Panthers. He turned Spahn Ranch into a defensive camp, with night patrols of armed guards.Sanders 2002, 151. \\"If we'd needed any more proof that Helter Skelter was coming down very soon, this was it,\\" Tex Watson would later write. \\"Blackie was trying to get at the chosen ones.\\"  Hinman murder  Gary Allen Hinman was a music teacher and PhD student at UCLA. At some point in the late 1960s, he befriended members of the Manson Family, allowing some to occasionally stay at his home. Manson was under the impression that Hinman had considerable stocks and bonds and owned his property. Believing that he was wealthy, Manson sent Family members Bobby Beausoleil, Mary Brunner and Susan Atkins to Hinman's home on July 25, 1969 to convince him to join the Family and turn over the assets Manson thought Hinman had inherited. The three individuals held the uncooperative Hinman hostage for two days, during which time Manson arrived with a sword and slashed his ear. After that, Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death, allegedly on Manson's instruction. Before leaving the Topanga Canyon residence, Beausoleil or one of the women used Hinman's blood to write \\"Political piggy\\" on the wall and to draw a panther paw, a Black Panther symbol.Sanders 2002, page 184. In magazine interviews of 1981 and 1998–1999, Beausoleil said he went to Hinman's to recover money paid to Hinman for drugs that had supposedly been bad; he added that Brunner and Atkins, unaware of his intent, went along merely to visit Hinman. Atkins, in her 1977 autobiography, wrote that Manson directly told Beausoleil, Brunner, and her to go to Hinman's and get the supposed inheritance of $21,000. She said that two days earlier Manson had told her privately that, if she wanted to \\"do something important\\", she could kill Hinman and get his money. Beausoleil was arrested on August 6, 1969, after he was caught driving Hinman's car. Police found the murder weapon in the tire well. Two days later Manson told Family members at Spahn Ranch, \\"Now is the time for Helter Skelter.\\"Prosecution's closing argument Murders of Tate, Sebring, Folger, Frykowski, and Parent On the night of August 8, 1969, Manson directed Watson to take Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian, and Patricia Krenwinkel to Melcher's former home at 10050 Cielo Drive in Los Angeles and kill everyone there. The home had only recently been rented to actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski (Polanski was away in Europe working on The Day of the Dolphin). Manson told the three women to do as Watson told them. The Family members proceeded to kill the five people they found: Sharon Tate (eight and a half months pregnant), who was living there at the time; Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, and Wojtek Frykowski, who were visiting her; and Steven Parent, who had been visiting the caretaker of the home. Atkins wrote \\"pig\\" with Tate’s blood on the front door as they left. The murders created a nationwide sensation.  Murder of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca  The next night of August 9, 1969, six Family members—Leslie Van Houten, Steve \\"Clem\\" Grogan, and the four from the previous night—drove out on Manson's orders. Displeased by the panic attack of the victims at Cielo Drive, Manson accompanied the six, \\"to show them how to do it.\\" After a few hours' ride, in which he considered a number of murders and even attempted one of them, Manson gave Kasabian directions that brought the group to 3301 Waverly Drive. This was the home of supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, a dress shop co-owner. Located in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles, it was next door to a house at which Manson and Family members had attended a party the previous year. According to Atkins and Kasabian, Manson disappeared up the driveway and returned to say he had tied up the house's occupants. He then sent Watson up with Krenwinkel and Van Houten. In his autobiography, Watson stated that having gone up alone, Manson returned to take him up to the house with him. After Manson pointed out a sleeping man through a window, the two of them entered through the unlocked back door. Watson added at trial, he \\"went along with\\" the women's account, which he figured made him \\"look that much less responsible.\\" As Watson related it, Manson roused the sleeping Leno LaBianca from the couch at gunpoint and had Watson bind his hands with a leather thong. After Rosemary was brought briefly into the living room from the bedroom, Watson followed Manson's instructions to cover the couple's heads with pillowcases. He bound these in place with lamp cords. Manson left, sending Krenwinkel and Van Houten into the house with instructions that the couple be killed. Before leaving Spahn Ranch, Watson had complained to Manson of the inadequacy of the previous night's weapons. Now, sending the women from the kitchen to the bedroom to which Rosemary LaBianca had been returned, he went to the living room and began stabbing Leno LaBianca with a chrome-plated bayonet. The first thrust went into the man's throat. Sounds of a scuffle in the bedroom drew Watson there to discover Rosemary LaBianca keeping the women at bay by swinging the lamp tied to her neck. After subduing her with several stabs of the bayonet, he returned to the living room and resumed attacking Leno, whom he stabbed a total of 12 times with the bayonet. After this attack, the word \\"WAR\\" was carved into his abdomen by a perpetrator. Returning to the bedroom, Watson found Krenwinkel stabbing Rosemary LaBianca with a knife from the LaBianca kitchen. Heeding Manson's instruction to make sure each of the women played a part, Watson told Van Houten to stab Mrs. LaBianca too. She did, stabbing her approximately 16 times in the back and the exposed buttocks. At trial, Van Houten would claim, uncertainly, that Rosemary LaBianca was dead when she stabbed her. Evidence showed that many of Mrs. LaBianca's 41 stab wounds had, in fact, been inflicted post-mortem. While Watson cleaned off the bayonet and showered, Krenwinkel wrote \\"Rise\\" and \\"Death to pigs\\" on the walls and \\"Healter Skelter\\" on the refrigerator door, all in LaBianca's blood. She gave Leno LaBianca 14 puncture wounds with an ivory-handled, two-tined carving fork, which she left jutting out of his stomach. She also planted a steak knife in his throat. Meanwhile, hoping for a double crime, Manson had gone on to direct Kasabian to drive to the Venice home of an actor acquaintance of hers, another \\"piggy\\". Depositing the other three Family members who had departed Spahn with him that evening at the man's apartment building, Manson drove back to Spahn Ranch, leaving them and the LaBianca killers to hitchhike home. Kasabian thwarted this murder by deliberately knocking on the wrong apartment door and waking a stranger. As the group abandoned the murder plan and left, Atkins defecated in the stairwell.  Investigation and trial   Investigation  The Tate murders became national news on August 9, 1969. The Polanskis' housekeeper, Winifred Chapman, had arrived for work that morning and discovered the murder scene. On August 10, detectives of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which had jurisdiction in the Hinman case, informed Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detectives assigned to the Tate case of the bloody writing at the Hinman house. Thinking the Tate murders were a consequence of a drug transaction, the Tate team ignored this and the crimes' other similarities.Sanders 2002, 243–44. The Tate autopsies were under way and the LaBianca bodies were yet to be discovered. Steven Parent, the shooting victim in the Tate driveway, was determined to have been an acquaintance of William Garretson, who lived in the guest house. Garretson was a young man hired by Rudi Altobelli to take care of the property while Altobelli was away. As the killers arrived, Parent had been leaving Cielo Drive, after a visit to Garretson. Held briefly as a Tate suspect, Garretson told police he had neither seen nor heard anything on the murder night. He was released on August 11, 1969, after undergoing a polygraph examination that indicated he had not been involved in the crimes. Interviewed decades later, he stated he had, in fact, witnessed a portion of the murders, as the examination suggested. Garretson died in August 2016. The LaBianca crime scene was discovered at about 10:30 p.m. on August 10, approximately 19 hours after the murders were committed. Fifteen-year-old Frank Struthers—Rosemary's son from a prior marriage and Leno's stepson—returned from a camping trip and was disturbed by seeing all of the window shades of his home drawn and by the fact that his stepfather's speedboat was still attached to the family car, which was parked in the driveway. He called his older sister and her boyfriend. The boyfriend, Joe Dorgan, accompanied the younger Struthers into the home and discovered Leno's body. Rosemary's body was found by investigating police officers. On August 12, 1969, the LAPD told the press it had ruled out any connection between the Tate and LaBianca homicides. On August 16, the sheriff's office raided Spahn Ranch and arrested Manson and 25 others, as \\"suspects in a major auto theft ring\\" that had been stealing Volkswagen Beetles and converting them into dune buggies. Weapons were seized, but, because the warrant had been misdated, the group was released a few days later. In a report at the end of August when virtually all leads had gone nowhere, the LaBianca detectives noted a possible connection between the bloody writings at the LaBianca house and \\"the singing group the Beatles' most recent album.\\"  Breakthrough  Still working separately from the Tate team, the LaBianca team checked with the sheriff's office in mid-October about possible similar crimes. They learned of the Hinman case. They also learned that the Hinman detectives had spoken with Beausoleil's girlfriend, Kitty Lutesinger. She had been arrested a few days earlier with members of \\"the Manson Family\\". The arrests, for car thefts, had taken place at the desert ranches to which the Family had moved and where, unknown to authorities, its members had been searching Death Valley for a hole in the ground—access to the Bottomless Pit.Watkins, Ch. 21. A joint force of National Park Service Rangers and officers from the California Highway Patrol and the Inyo County Sheriff's Office—federal, state, and county personnel—had raided both Myers Ranch and Barker Ranch after following clues unwittingly left when Family members burned an earthmover owned by Death Valley National Monument.Sanders 2002, 282–83.Watkins, Ch. 22 The raiders had found stolen dune buggies and other vehicles and had arrested two dozen people, including Manson. A Highway Patrol officer found Manson hiding in a cabinet beneath Barker's bathroom sink. The officers had no idea that the people they were arresting were involved with the murders. Following up leads a month after they had spoken with Lutesinger, LaBianca detectives contacted members of a motorcycle gang Manson tried to enlist as his bodyguards while the Family was at Spahn Ranch. While the gang members were providing information that suggested a link between Manson and the murders, a dormitory mate of Susan Atkins informed LAPD of the Family's involvement in the crimes. Atkins was booked for the Hinman murder after she told sheriff's detectives that she had been involved in it.Report on questioning of Katherine Lutesinger and Susan Atkins October 13, 1969, by Los Angeles Sheriff's officers Paul Whiteley and Charles Guenther. Transferred to Sybil Brand Institute, a detention center in Monterey Park, California, she had begun talking to bunkmates Ronnie Howard and Virginia Graham, to whom she gave accounts of the events in which she had been involved.  Apprehension  County Sheriff mugshot of Manson August 16, 1969. He was arrested on suspicion of car theft. Those charges were later dropped on account of a misdated warrant. On December 1, 1969, acting on the information from these sources, LAPD announced warrants for the arrest of Watson, Krenwinkel, and Kasabian in the Tate case; the suspects' involvement in the LaBianca murders was noted. Manson and Atkins, already in custody, were not mentioned; the connection between the LaBianca case and Van Houten, who was also among those arrested near Death Valley, had not yet been recognized. Watson and Krenwinkel were already under arrest, with authorities in McKinney, Texas and Mobile, Alabama having picked them up on notice from LAPD. Informed that a warrant was out for her arrest, Kasabian voluntarily surrendered to authorities in Concord, New Hampshire on December 2. Before long, physical evidence such as Krenwinkel's and Watson's fingerprints, which had been collected by LAPD at Cielo Drive, was augmented by evidence recovered by the public. On September 1, 1969, the distinctive .22-caliber Hi Standard \\"Buntline Special\\" revolver Watson used on Parent, Sebring, and Frykowski had been found and given to the police by Steven Weiss, a 10-year-old who lived near the Tate residence. In mid-December, when the Los Angeles Times published a crime account based on information Susan Atkins had given her attorney, Weiss's father made several phone calls which finally prompted LAPD to locate the gun in its evidence file and connect it with the murders via ballistics tests. Acting on that same newspaper account, a local ABC television crew quickly located and recovered the bloody clothing discarded by the Tate killers. The knives discarded en route from the Tate residence were never recovered, despite a search by some of the same crewmen and, months later, by LAPD. A knife found behind the cushion of a chair in the Tate living room was apparently that of Susan Atkins, who lost her knife in the course of the attack.Atkins 1977, 141.  Trial  The trial began June 15, 1970. The prosecution's main witness was Kasabian, who, along with Manson, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, had been charged with seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Since Kasabian, by all accounts, had not participated in the killings, she was granted immunity in exchange for testimony that detailed the nights of the crimes. Originally, a deal had been made with Atkins in which the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty against her in exchange for her grand jury testimony on which the indictments were secured; once Atkins repudiated that testimony, the deal was withdrawn. Because Van Houten had participated only in the LaBianca killings, she was charged with two counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Originally, Judge William Keene had reluctantly granted Manson permission to act as his own attorney. Because of Manson's conduct, including violations of a gag order and submission of \\"outlandish\\" and \\"nonsensical\\" pretrial motions, the permission was withdrawn before the trial's start. Manson filed an affidavit of prejudice against Keene, who was replaced by Judge Charles H. Older. On Friday, July 24, the first day of testimony, Manson appeared in court with an X carved into his forehead. He issued a statement that he was \\"considered inadequate and incompetent to speak or defend [him]self\\"—and had \\"X'd [him]self from [the establishment's] world.\\"Sanders 2002, 388. Over the following weekend, the female defendants duplicated the mark on their own foreheads, as did most Family members within another day or so. (Years later, Manson carved the X into a swastika. See \\"Remaining in view\\", below.) The prosecution argued the triggering of \\"Helter Skelter\\" was Manson's main motive. The crime scene's bloody White Album references (pig, rise, helter skelter) were correlated with testimony about Manson predictions that the murders blacks would commit at the outset of Helter Skelter would involve the writing of \\"pigs\\" on walls in victims' blood. Testimony that Manson had said \\"now is the time for Helter Skelter\\" was supplemented with Kasabian's testimony that, on the night of the LaBianca murders, Manson considered discarding Rosemary LaBianca's wallet on the street of a black neighborhood. Having obtained the wallet in the LaBianca house, he \\"wanted a black person to pick it up and use the credit cards so that the people, The Establishment, would think it was some sort of an organized group that killed these people.\\" On his direction, Kasabian had hidden it in the women's restroom of a service station near a black area. \\"I want to show blackie how to do it,\\" Manson had said as the Family members drove away after leaving the LaBianca house.  Ongoing disruptions  During the trial, Family members loitered near the entrances and corridors of the courthouse. To keep them out of the courtroom proper, the prosecution subpoenaed them as prospective witnesses, who would not be able to enter while others were testifying. When the group established itself in vigil on the sidewalk, some members wore sheathed hunting knives that, although in plain view, were carried legally. Each of them was also identifiable by the X on his or her forehead. Some Family members attempted to dissuade witnesses from testifying. Prosecution witnesses Paul Watkins and Juan Flynn were both threatened; Watkins was badly burned in a suspicious fire in his van. Former Family member Barbara Hoyt, who had overheard Susan Atkins describing the Tate murders to Family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse, agreed to accompany the latter to Hawaii. There, Moorehouse allegedly gave her a hamburger spiked with several doses of LSD. Found sprawled on a Honolulu curb in a drugged semi- stupor, Hoyt was taken to the hospital, where she did her best to identify herself as a witness in the Tate–LaBianca murder trial. Before the incident, Hoyt had been a reluctant witness; after the attempt to silence her, her reticence disappeared. On August 4, despite precautions taken by the court, Manson flashed the jury a Los Angeles Times front page whose headline was \\"Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares\\". This was a reference to a statement made the previous day when U.S. President Richard Nixon had decried what he saw as the media's glamorization of Manson. Voir dired by Judge Charles Older, the jurors contended that the headline had not influenced them. The next day, the female defendants stood up and said in unison that, in light of Nixon's remark, there was no point in going on with the trial. On October 5, Manson was denied the court's permission to question a prosecution witness whom defense attorneys had declined to cross-examine. Leaping over the defense table, Manson attempted to attack the judge. Wrestled to the ground by bailiffs, he was removed from the courtroom with the female defendants, who had subsequently risen and begun chanting in Latin. Thereafter, Older allegedly began wearing a revolver under his robes.  Defense rests  On November 16, the prosecution rested its case. Three days later, after arguing standard dismissal motions, the defense stunned the court by resting as well, without calling a single witness. Shouting their disapproval, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten demanded their right to testify. In chambers, the women's lawyers told the judge their clients wanted to testify that they had planned and committed the crimes and that Manson had not been involved. By resting their case, the defense lawyers had tried to stop this; Van Houten's attorney, Ronald Hughes, vehemently stated that he would not \\"push a client out the window\\". In the prosecutor's view, it was Manson who was advising the women to testify in this way as a means of saving himself. Speaking about the trial in a 1987 documentary, Krenwinkel said, \\"The entire proceedings were scripted—by Charlie.\\"Biography—\\"Charles Manson.\\" A&E; Network. The next day, Manson testified. Lest Manson's address violate the California Supreme Court's decision in People v. Aranda by making statements implicating his co- defendants, the jury was removed from the courtroom. Speaking for more than an hour, Manson said, among other things, that \\"the music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment.\\" He said, \\"Why blame it on me? I didn't write the music.\\" \\"To be honest with you,\\" Manson also stated, \\"I don't recall ever saying 'Get a knife and a change of clothes and go do what Tex says. As the body of the trial concluded and with the closing arguments impending, defense attorney Hughes disappeared during a weekend trip. When Maxwell Keith was appointed to represent Van Houten in Hughes' absence, a delay of more than two weeks was required to permit Keith to familiarize himself with the voluminous trial transcripts. No sooner had the trial resumed, just before Christmas, than disruptions of the prosecution's closing argument by the defendants led Older to ban the four defendants from the courtroom for the remainder of the guilt phase. This may have occurred because the defendants were acting in collusion with each other and were simply putting on a performance, which Older said was becoming obvious.  Conviction and penalty phase  On January 25, 1971, the jury returned guilty verdicts against the four defendants on each of the 27 separate counts against them. Not far into the trial's penalty phase, the jurors saw, at last, the defense that Manson—in the prosecution's view—had planned to present. Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten testified the murders had been conceived as \\"copycat\\" versions of the Hinman murder, for which Atkins now took credit. The killings, they said, were intended to draw suspicion away from Bobby Beausoleil by resembling the crime for which he had been jailed. This plan had supposedly been the work of, and carried out under the guidance of, not Manson, but someone allegedly in love with Beausoleil—Linda Kasabian. Among the narrative's weak points was the inability of Atkins to explain why, as she was maintaining, she had written \\"political piggy\\" at the Hinman house in the first place. Midway through the penalty phase, Manson shaved his head and trimmed his beard to a fork; he told the press, \\"I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head.\\" In what the prosecution regarded as belated recognition on their part that imitation of Manson only proved his domination, the female defendants refrained from shaving their heads until the jurors retired to weigh the state's request for the death penalty. The effort to exonerate Manson via the \\"copy cat\\" scenario failed. On March 29, 1971, the jury returned verdicts of death against all four defendants on all counts. On April 19, 1971, Judge Older sentenced the four to death.  Aftermath  1970s–1980s On the day the verdicts recommending the death penalty were returned, news came that the badly decomposed body of Ronald Hughes had been found wedged between two boulders in Ventura County. It was rumored, although never proven, that Hughes was murdered by the Family, possibly because he had stood up to Manson and refused to allow Van Houten to take the stand and absolve Manson of the crimes. Though he might have perished in flooding,Sanders 2002, 436–38. Family member Sandra Good stated that Hughes was \\"the first of the retaliation murders\\". Watson returned to McKinney, Texas after the Tate–LaBianca murders. He was arrested in Texas on November 30, 1969, after local police were notified by California investigators that his fingerprints were found to match a print found on the front door of the Tate home. Watson fought extradition to California long enough that he was not included among the three defendants tried with Manson.Extradition of Charles 'Tex' Watson The trial commenced in August 1971; by October, he, too, had been found guilty on seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Unlike the others, Watson presented a psychiatric defense; prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi made short work of Watson's insanity claims. Like his co-conspirators, Watson was sentenced to death. In February 1972, the death sentences of all five parties were automatically reduced to life in prison by People v. Anderson, 493 P.2d 880, 6 Cal. 3d 628 (Cal. 1972), in which the California Supreme Court abolished the death penalty in that state. After his return to prison, Manson's rhetoric and hippie speeches held little sway. Though he found temporary acceptance from the Aryan Brotherhood, his role was submissive to a sexually aggressive member of the group at San Quentin. Before the conclusion of Manson's Tate–LaBianca trial, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times tracked down Manson's mother, remarried and living in the Pacific Northwest. The former Kathleen Maddox claimed that, in childhood, her son had suffered no neglect; he had even been \\"pampered by all the women who surrounded him.\\"Smith, Dave.

Willett was found by a hiker near Guerneville, California. Months earlier, he had been forced to dig his own grave, and then was shot and poorly buried; his body was found with one hand protruding from the grave and the head and other hand missing, most likely because of scavenging animals. His station wagon was found outside a house in Stockton where several Manson followers were living, including Priscilla Cooper, Lynette \\"Squeaky\\" Fromme, and Nancy Pitman. Police forced their way into the house and arrested several of the people there, along with Fromme, who had called the house after they had arrived.

She had been killed very recently by a gunshot to the head, in what the Family members initially claimed was an accident. It was later suggested that she was killed out of fear that she would reveal who killed her husband, as the discovery of his body had become prominent news. The Willetts' infant daughter was found alive in the house. Michael Monfort pleaded guilty to murdering Reni Willett, and Priscilla Cooper, James Craig, and Nancy Pitman pleaded guilty as accessories after the fact. Monfort and William Goucher later pleaded guilty to the murder of James Willett, and James Craig pleaded guilty as an accessory after the fact. The group had been living in the house with the Willetts while committing various robberies. Shortly after killing Willett, Monfort had used Willett's identification papers to pose as Willett after being arrested for an armed robbery of a liquor store. News reports suggested that James Willett was not involved in the robberies\\"Ex-cons, Manson Girls Charged\\" , The Billings Gazette, November 15, 1972. and wanted to move away, but was killed out of fear that he would talk to police. After leaving the Marines following two tours in Vietnam, Willett had been an ESL teacher for immigrant children.  Shea murder  In a 1971 trial that took place after his Tate–LaBianca convictions, Manson was found guilty of the murders of Gary Hinman and Donald \\"Shorty\\" Shea and was given a life sentence. Shea was a Spahn Ranch stuntman and horse wrangler who had been killed approximately ten days after an August 16, 1969, sheriff's raid on the ranch. Manson, who suspected that Shea helped set up the raid, had apparently believed Shea was trying to get Spahn to run the Family off the ranch. Manson may have considered it a \\"sin\\" that the white Shea had married a black woman; and there was the possibility that Shea knew about the Tate–LaBianca killings.Sanders 2002, 271–2. In separate trials, Family members Bruce Davis and Steve \\"Clem\\" Grogan were also found guilty of Shea's murder.Transcript of Charles Manson's 1992 parole hearing University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law. Retrieved May 24, 2007. In 1977, authorities learned the precise location of the remains of Shorty Shea and, contrary to Family claims, that Shea had not been dismembered and buried in several places. Contacting the prosecutor in his case, Steve Grogan told him Shea's corpse had been buried in one piece; he drew a map that pinpointed the location of the body, which was recovered. Of those convicted of Manson- ordered murders, Grogan would become, in 1985, the first one to be paroled.  Remaining in view  The Folsom State Prison, one of the facilities where Manson was held On September 5, 1975, the Family rocketed back to national attention when Squeaky Fromme attempted to assassinate U.S. President Gerald Ford. The attempt took place in Sacramento, to which she and Manson follower Sandra Good had moved to be near Manson while he was incarcerated at Folsom State Prison. A subsequent search of the apartment shared by Fromme, Good, and a Family recruit turned up evidence that, coupled with later actions on the part of Good, resulted in Good's conviction for conspiring to send threatening communications through the United States mail and transmitting death threats by way of interstate commerce. The threats involved corporate executives and U.S. government officials vis-à-vis supposed environmental dereliction on their part. Fromme was sentenced to 15 years to life, becoming the first person sentenced under United States Code Title 18, chapter 84 (1965), which made it a Federal crime to attempt to assassinate the President of the United States. In December 1987, Fromme, serving a life sentence for the assassination attempt, escaped briefly from Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, in West Virginia. She was trying to reach Manson, who she had heard had testicular cancer; she was apprehended within days. She was released on parole from Federal Medical Center, Carswell on August 14, 2009. 1980s–present In a 1994 conversation with Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, Catherine Share, a one-time Manson-follower, stated that her testimony in the penalty phase of Manson's trial had been a fabrication intended to save Manson from the gas chamber and that it had been given under Manson's explicit direction. Share's testimony had introduced the copycat-motive story, which the testimony of the three female defendants echoed and according to which the Tate–LaBianca murders had been Linda Kasabian's idea. In a 1997 segment of the tabloid television program Hard Copy, Share implied that her testimony had been given under a Manson threat of physical harm.Catherine Share with Vincent Bugliosi, Hard Copy, 1997 YouTube. Retrieved May 30, 2007. In August 1971, after Manson's trial and sentencing, Share had participated in a violent California retail store robbery, the object of which was the acquisition of weapons to help free Manson. In January 1996, a Manson website was established by latter- day Manson follower George Stimson, who was helped by Sandra Good. Good had been released from prison in 1985, after serving 10 years of her 15-year sentence for the death threats.\\"Manson's Family Affair Living in Cyberspace\\". Wired, April 16, 1997.

He stated that Manson did come to Hinman's house and slash Hinman with a sword, which he had previously denied in a 1981 interview with Oui magazine. Beausoleil stated that when he read about the Tate murders in the newspaper, \\"I wasn't even sure at that point—really, I had no idea who had done it until Manson's group were actually arrested for it. It had only crossed my mind and I had a premonition, perhaps.

This corroborated the unofficial results of the polygraph examination that had been given to Garretson on August 10, 1969, and that had effectively eliminated him as a suspect. The LAPD officer who conducted the examination had concluded Garretson was \\"clean\\" on participation in the crimes but \\"muddy\\" as to his having heard anything. Garretson did not explain why he had withheld his knowledge of the events.

To the west is Millwall, to the east and south is Greenwich, to the northwest Canary Wharf and to the north, across the Blue Bridge, is the rest of Poplar. It is in Blackwall & Cubitt Town Ward of Tower Hamlets London Borough Council. History A map showing the Cubitt Town ward of Poplar Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916. It is named after William Cubitt, Lord Mayor of London (1860–1862), who was responsible for the development of the housing and amenities of the area in the 1840s and 1850s, mainly to house the growing population of workers in the local docks, shipbuilding yards and factories. As it grew, Cubitt also created many local businesses employing manual labourers as well as the streets of housing to accommodate them. Shipbuilding For many years this area was home to a number of shipbuilders, such as Westwood, Baillie, Samuda Brothers, J & W Dudgeon and Yarrow Shipbuilders. , the first British warship designed to carry her main armament in gun turrets, was launched here. Other industries The businesses included those involved in cement, pottery and brick production. Asphalt production was another growth industry, coinciding with the growth, development, and industrialisation of areas throughout the British Isles. In Cubitt Town, the Pyrimont Wharf was developed in 1861 by the Asphalte de Seyssel Company of Thames Embankment (later known as the Seyssel Asphalte Company or Seyssel Pyrimont Asphalte Company), with asphalt production taken over in the 1870s by Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company. Housing Estates in the area include: * New Union Wharf Estate - East Thames Housing * Samuda Estate - One Housing * St John's Estate - One Housing * Amsterdam Road - Private * Millennium Wharf - Private The area is a mix of old east London working-class communities transplanted into 1960s and 1970s high-rise estates and the middle-class workers in the Canary Wharf complex attracted by relatively low prices for riverside living, plus less recent Bangladeshi and East Asian immigrant populations. Learning and education Cubitt Town Library, Strattondale Street, London E14 3HG A public library was financed by Andrew Carnegie and built by C. Harrold Norton, being completed in 1905. Will Crooks, the then Mayor of Poplar, had attended a meeting at the Guildhall, where Carnegie had promised to fund public libraries. Crooks was able to get a commitment from him to pay for two libraries, this one in Cubitt Town and another in Bromley by Bow. Carnegie agreed to provide £15,000 for both together. The total expense for this building was £6,805 13s 10d, which included some neighbouring land which originally served as a public garden before providing space for an extension to be used a meeting hall and erected in 1962. The building is currently owned by the Tower Hamlets London Borough Council as part of their library service. Schools Primary schools * Cubitt Town School * St Luke's School Recreation Cubitt town is home to a number of recreational facilities: * St John's Park * Mudchute, an urban farm described by the local authority as the largest urban farm in Europe Transport The nearest station to Cubitt Town is Crossharbour on the Docklands Light Railway, which opened on 31 August 1987. London Buses contracted routes serve Cubitt Town, with routes 135, 277, D7, D8 and N550. Cubitt Town is connected to London's road network by the north-south Manchester Road A1206. Access across the River Thames is by the Greenwich Foot Tunnel and the National Cycle Route 1 to the west (which also uses the Greenwich Foot Tunnel).

Dearborn was the first President of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and the author of many books. Biography Early life Dearborn was the son of Secretary of War and Major General Henry Dearborn by his second wife and named for his father's friend, Alexander Scammell. Dearborn was married to Hannah Swett Lee, daughter of Colonel William Raymond Lee (1745–1824) of Massachusetts. Dearborn attended the common schools; attended Williams College for two years; and graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1803. Early career Dearborn studied law, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Salem, Massachusetts and Portland (then part of Massachusetts's District of Maine). In 1808 he oversaw the construction of Fort Preble and Fort Scammel in the harbor defenses of Portland. During the War of 1812 he commanded volunteers manning the defenses of Boston harbor. He replaced his father as the Collector of the Port of Boston and served from 1813 to 1829. He was promoted to brigadier general in the Massachusetts Militia in 1814. After the war, he was elected captain of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts in 1816. Dearborn was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815,American Antiquarian Society Members Directory and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1823. Political career Dearborn was a delegate to the Massachusetts state constitutional convention in 1820. He was a member of the Massachusetts state house of representatives in 1829 and a member of the Massachusetts Senate in 1830. He was elected as an Anti-Jacksonian Representative from Massachusetts 10th District to the Twenty-second Congress (1831–1833). He was defeated running for reelection in 1832. He served as adjutant general of the Massachusetts Militia with the rank of major general from 1834 to 1843. He was elected Mayor of Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1846 and served from 1847 to 1851. In 1848, while he was Mayor of Roxbury, Dearborn designed and founded the Forest Hills Cemetery. He also designed Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the first rural cemetery in the nation. Society of the Cincinnati In 1832, following the decease of his father, he was admitted to the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. In 1848, following the death of President General William Popham in September 1847, he was elected as President General of the Society. He was the first President General to be a hereditary member rather than a veteran of the Revolution. As President General he proposed changes in the Society's membership rules to allow for descendants of other than original members to join. This provision is known as the Rule of 1854. He died in office in 1851, having served a single three-year term. Attempted Vice Presidential Nomination The Native American Party, a precursor to the Know Nothings, which had split from the Whig Party in 1845, met in September 1847 in Philadelphia, where they nominated Zachary Taylor for president while Dearborn was selected as his running mate. However, when the Whig Party nominated Taylor for the presidency with Millard Fillmore as his running mate the following year, this rendered his previous nomination moot and the Native American Party failed to make an alternate nomination. Death and interment Dearborn died on July 29, 1851 at the age of 68 in Portland, Maine and is interred in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. Legacy The dearborn, a light four-wheeled carriage with curtained sides, was named after him (he maintained such a carriage).MetaGlossary.com: Dearborn Dearborn's nephew was William R. Lee (1807–1891), who was colonel of the 20th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment during the Civil War and was breveted to brigadier general after the war. Three successive grade schools in Roxbury have been named after General Dearborn: The first was built in 1852; the second, still standing at 25 Ambrose Street, was built in 1905; and after that closed, the old Roxbury High School was renamed the Dearborn Middle School in 1981. A fourth school, the Dearborn STEM School, is now in the planning stages. References * History of the Forest Hills Cemetery Notes External links *Henry A. S. Dearborn collection, William L.

The Nazi Seizure of Power (1965) was his first book. He also wrote The Infancy of Nazism and worked on studies of the effectiveness of Nazi propaganda and of the Social Democratic underground in the Third Reich.

Rather, Allen claims, Hitler's Nazi movement \\"seized power\\" in an act akin to democratic tactics. His most famous book, The Nazi Seizure of Power: The Experience of a Single German Town 1930-1935, was written to explain how one city, (Northeim, Germany, in the book with the fictional name of Thalburg) fell into the Nazi trap. Fed by Nazi propaganda, many people of Thalburg, especially in the middle classes, in the midst of the Depression saw the Nazis as a way to get their country back to greatness that Hitler and the Nazis promised they would do.

It is bounded on three sides by a loop of the Thames, between the Isle of Dogs to the west and Silvertown to the east. To the south is the rest of Greenwich, to the south-east is Charlton. Formerly known as Greenwich MarshesOS 1:2500 map of 1867, Republished as West India Docks 1867, The Godfrey Edition, Alan Godfrey Maps, 1991, Gateshead, and as Bugsby's Marshes, it became known as East Greenwich as it developed in the 19th century, but more recently has been called North Greenwich due to the location of the North Greenwich Underground station. This should not be confused with North Greenwich on the Isle of Dogs, at the north side of a former ferry from Greenwich. The peninsula's northernmost point on the riverside is known as Blackwall Point, and this may have led to the name Blackwall Peninsula sometimes being used in the late 20th century.E.g. Hansard parliamentary reports: Simon Hughes in 1993 and John Austin-Walker in 1994.. Retrieved 24 April 2009 Landmarks include The Dome (also known by the current corporate logo The O2 and previously the Millennium Dome) and the southern end of the Blackwall Tunnel, but the area is now being substantially redeveloped with new homes, offices, schools, parks and Ravensbourne University London a creative based university built on the peninsula in 2010, situated neighbouring The O2. History Greenwich Powder Magazine (as it appeared in 1738) The peninsula was drained by Dutch engineers in the 16th century, allowing it to be used as pasture land. In the 17th century, Blackwall Point (the northern tip of the peninsula, opposite Blackwall) gained notoriety as a location where pirates' corpses were hung in cages as a deterrent to other would-be pirates. In the 1690s the Board of Ordnance established a gunpowder magazine on the west side of the peninsula, which was in operation by 1695 serving as the government's primary magazine (where newly milled powder was stored prior to being distributed, on board specially equipped hoys, to wherever it was needed). Alongside the magazine were a wharf, a proof house and accommodation for the resident Storekeeper. From the early 18th century, however, local residents began petitioning Parliament, asking for the magazine (and its dangerous contents in particular) to be removed; this eventually led to the establishment of a new set of Royal Gunpowder Magazines downriver at Purfleet, which was opened in 1765. By 1771 gunpowder was no longer stored at Greenwich, though the buildings remained in situ for some decades afterwards. c1872 map of the Greenwich Peninsula and part of the Isle of Dogs The peninsula was steadily industrialised from the early 19th century onwards. In 1857 a plan was presented to Parliament for a huge dock occupying much of the peninsula, connected to Greenwich Reach to the west and Bugsby's Reach to the east, but this came to nothing.Mary Mills, Greenwich Marsh - The 300 years before the Dome, London: M.Wright, 1999, Early industries included Henry Blakeley's Ordnance Works making heavy guns, with other sites making chemicals, submarine cables, iron boats, iron and steel. Henry Bessemer built a steel works in the early 1860s to supply the London shipbuilding industry, but this closed as a result of a fall in demand due to the financial crisis of 1866.Bessemer's autobiography Chapter 21 Later came oil mills, shipbuilding (for example the 1870 clippers Blackadder and Hallowe'en built by Maudslay), boiler making, manufacture of Portland cement and linoleum (Bessemer's works became the Victoria linoleum works) and the South Metropolitan Gas company's huge East Greenwich Gas Works.OS 1:2500 map of 1894, Republished as West India Docks & Greenwich Marshes 1894, The Godfrey Edition, Alan Godfrey Maps, Gateshead, 2000, Early in the 20th century came bronze manufacturers Delta Metals and works making asbestos and 'Molassine Meal' animal feed.OS 1:2500 map of 1914, Republished as West India Docks 1914, The Godfrey Edition, Alan Godfrey Maps, Gateshead, 1991, A map showing the Marsh ward of Greenwich Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916. For over 100 years the peninsula was dominated by the gasworks which primarily produced town gas, also known as coal gas. The gasworks grew to , the largest in Europe, also producing coke, tar and chemicals as important secondary products. The site had its own extensive railway system connected to the main railway line near Charlton, and a large jetty used to unload coal and load coke. There were two huge gas holders, of 8.6 and 12.2 million ft3 (240,000m3 and 345,000m3). The larger holder, originally the largest in the world, was reduced to 8.9 million ft3 (250,000m3) when it was damaged in the Silvertown explosion in 1917, but was still the largest in England until it was damaged again by a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb in 1978. Originally manufacturing gas from coal, the plant began to manufacture gas from oil in the 1960s. Its peak production of 400 million ft3 per day (11.3 million m3) in the mid 1960s is believed to have been the largest of any single site in the world.Carr, R.J.M. (Ed) 1983,Dockland, NELP/GLC, The discovery of natural gas reserves in the North Sea soon rendered the complex obsolete. The peninsula glimpsed from Greenwich Park in 1973. The view is framed on left and right by the chimneys of Greenwich Power Station and Blackwall Point Power Station On the eastern shore was Blackwall Point Power Station; the original station from the 1890s was replaced in the 1950s by a new station which ceased operation about 1981. A large area including the site of the Victoria linoleum works later became the Victoria Deep Water Terminal in 1966, handling container traffic. At the southern end of the peninsula Enderby's Wharf was occupied by a succession of famous submarine cable companies from 1857 onwards, including Glass Elliot, W T Henley, Telcon, Submarine Cables Ltd, STC, Nortel and Alcatel. The peninsula remained relatively remote from central London until the opening of the Blackwall Tunnel in 1897, and had no passenger railway or London Underground service until the opening of North Greenwich tube station on the Jubilee line in 1999. The west side of the peninsula from the Thames in 2001 - part of the glucose works. Closure of the gasworks, power station and other industries in the late 20th century left much of the Greenwich Peninsula a barren wasteland, much of it heavily contaminated. In the early years of the 21st century, surviving industries were mainly concentrated on the western side of the peninsula, between the river and the A102 Blackwall Tunnel southern approach road. They included Alcatel, a Tunnel Refiners/Amylum glucose plant (from 1976 until about 2008 part of Tate & Lyle) which closed in 2009, and two large marine aggregate terminals on the Delta Metals and Victoria Deep Water Terminal sites. One of the two gas holders also remains. Redevelopment in the 1990s The O2, the 2nd largest single-roofed structure in the world after the Philippine Arena Public and private investment since the early 1990s has brought about some dramatic changes in the peninsula's topography. In 1997 the national regeneration agency, English Partnerships, (now named the Homes and Communities Agency) purchased 1.21 square kilometres (300 acres) of disused land on the peninsula. The agency's investment of over £225m has helped to enhance the transport network and create new homes, commercial space and community facilities and to open up access to parkland along the river. In addition to the construction of the Millennium Dome, new roads were built on the eastern side of the Peninsula in anticipation of new developments. New riverside walkways, cycle paths and public artworks were also created, including Antony Gormley's Quantum Cloud and A Slice of Reality, a work by Richard Wilson. Two phases of Greenwich Millennium Village, a mixed-tenure residential development designed by the world renowned architect Ralph Erskine (architect) , with a primary school, a medical centre, a nature reserve with associated education centre have been completed. A Holiday Inn hotel was also built nearby, and the Greenwich Yacht Club was relocated to a new site south- east of the Dome. North Greenwich tube station on the Jubilee line opened in 1999. It is one of the largest London Underground stations and also has a bus station. The North Greenwich Pier offering commuter boat service to other parts of London, both east and west, is located on the Thames just to the east of the tube station. In 2004 outline planning permission was granted for further large-scale redevelopment of the site, including over 10,000 further homes, some facing the river or overlooking the park, of office space and the conversion of the Millennium Dome into an indoor arena, renamed The O2, which was used as a London 2012 venue. South of The O2, new public realms were created, Peninsula Square and Green Place. To the east of Peninsula Square is Ravensbourne University London, which relocated to Greenwich Peninsula in September 2010. In 2011, the university's campus won an award in the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Awards for London. From a shortlist of 55 schemes, the Ravensbourne building won the education and community category. To the south east of the square, the six storey 14 Pier Walk building houses offices for Transport for London.TfL begins move into new greener, cheaper Greenwich Peninsula offices, TfL press release, 13 August 2009 Adjacent to this is the 11 storey 6 Mitre Passage office building. New restaurants and shops have opened facing onto Peninsula Square and Green Place. Transport for London constructed a cable car over the River Thames for Summer of 2012 just before the 2012 Summer Olympics began. This runs from a riverside station south-east of the O2 over the river to the Royal Victoria Dock near the ExCeL Centre. Adjacent to the cable car terminus was a large temporary building housing the London Soccer Dome, formerly the David Beckham Academy. This opened in 2005 and the building finally closed in 2014, with the main structures being dismantled, transported and re-erected in Southend; the site is intended for residential use. Approximately 400m further south, is the Pilot Inn public house, one of the oldest remaining buildings on the peninsula. Greenwich combined heat and power (CHP) energy centre Central Park runs through the central spine of the peninsula, with the Greenwich Peninsula Ecology Park further south providing a haven for many different species of bird, plants and insects. A combined heat and power (CHP) energy centre has been constructed adjacent to and east of the A102 Blackwall Tunnel Southern Approach to provide district heating to an eventual total of 15,700 properties on the peninsula. It is operated by Pinnacle Power for Greenwich Peninsula ESCO Limited. A 49 m high tower forms part of the energy centre, designed by C. F. Møller Architects, and was completed in 2016. The tower is clad in a complex metal cladding formed of hundreds of triangular patterns (initially titled 'Lenticular Dazzle Camouflage'), designed by British artist Conrad Shawcross. The tower cladding later featured as part of an art trail around north Greenwich, with the work given the title 'The Optic Cloak'. In 2016, construction started on new buildings for St Mary Magdalene Church of England School (part of the Koinonia Federation; the federation currently operates at four Greenwich sites, two of which will move to the new building on completion in September 2018). The school site is located at the corner of Millennium Way and John Harrison Way, and will include sports facilities available for community use. Future development The peninsula is now being developed with new homes at Peninsula Riverside, and Parkside Peninsula Quays. The redevelopment of Greenwich Peninsula is planned to take around 20 years. The improved access to the peninsula from Canary Wharf, the City and the West End via the Jubilee line has increased the prospects for continued residential regeneration.

Landau, directed by Ronald Neame, that stars Walter Matthau, Glenda Jackson, Sam Waterston, Ned Beatty, and Herbert Lom. The screenplay was written by Bryan Forbes and Brian Garfield, based on Garfield's 1975 novel of the same name. Former CIA field officer Miles Kendig is intent on publishing an explosive memoir that will also expose the dirty tricks of Myerson, his obnoxious, incompetent, and profane former boss. Myerson and Kendig's protégé Joe Cutter are repeatedly foiled in their attempts to capture the former agent and stop the publication of his memoir. He cleverly stays one step ahead of his pursuers as the chase hopscotches around America and Western Europe. Garfield took the name of his book from the children’s game, “wherein a player has to retrieve ‘an elusive object' while hopping on a sidewalk from space to space. One false step or clumsy move could mean falling and landing on one’s backside.“ Matthau received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD in 2002 and in a 2K restoration on Blu-ray in 2017. Plot At Munich's Oktoberfest, veteran CIA field agent Miles Kendig (Matthau) and his team foil a microfilm transfer. Upon Kendig's return to Washington, his boss, Myerson (Beatty), reassigns him to a desk job because Kendig did not arrest Yaskov (Lom), the head of the KGB in Europe. Kendig explains to Myerson that he knows how Yaskov thinks, and it would take time and resources to identify and learn about a new replacement. Kendig's good friend and protege, Joe Cutter (Waterston), is nevertheless assigned to take over his mentor's old job. Instead of accepting this situation, Kendig takes action. He shreds his personnel file and flies to Salzburg to visit former lover Isobel Von Schoenenberg (Jackson), whom he has not seen in a while. Yaskov, guessing what has happened, meets Kendig and invites him to defect to the KGB; when Kendig refuses, Yaskov asks sarcastically if Kendig will be retiring and writing his memoirs. On the spot, Kendig decides to do exactly that: write and publish a memoir exposing the dirty tricks and general incompetence of Myerson's CIA. Isobel is horrified, saying that Myerson will send agents to kill him. She nevertheless helps by mailing copies of Kendig's first chapter to spy chiefs in the U.S., Soviet Union, China, France, Italy, and Great Britain. Myerson assigns Cutter to stop Kendig, and Yaskov, not wanting his own agency's follies exposed, also pursues his old adversary. Kendig baits his pursuers by sending them explosive chapters and by periodically informing them of his location. Leaving Europe, he returns to the U.S., cheerfully renting Myerson's own unoccupied Georgia family home, where he writes more chapters. After purposely leaking his address, Kendig maneuvers the FBI (which has jurisdiction) into shooting up Myerson's home with both bullets and tear gas, to Myerson's great dismay. Kendig flies to Bermuda by chartered seaplane, then on to London to present his publisher with the final chapter. Yaskov informs Cutter that one of his agents has spotted Kendig in London by chance. Kendig purchases a vintage biplane—a Stampe version of the Tiger Moth—and hires an engineer to custom-modify it for a specific task. Myerson meets Kendig's publisher, who rebuffs his threatening bluster and then tells them where Kendig's hotel room is. At the vacated room, all the pursuers read copies of the final chapter he has left for them. Kendig later ambushes Cutter in his hotel room, ties him up, gags him, and informs Cutter that he will be flying across the English Channel from a small airfield near Beachy Head. Meanwhile, Isobel gives her CIA minders the slip, and crosses the Channel by hovercraft to rendezvous early the next morning with Kendig. While everyone converges on the airfield, Kendig suffers a flat tire on his way and is taken by the local police to their station. When a policeman recognizes him from a posted fugitive bulletin, Kendig escapes by short-circuiting an electrical socket and stealing a police car. Kendig reaches the airfield, and the Americans and Yaskov arrive by helicopter soon after. Kendig's biplane takes off and is pursued by Myerson in the helicopter. He evades Myerson's gunfire for a while, but the plane is finally hit and suddenly explodes over the Channel. Myerson assumes that Kendig is finally dead. Cutter, however, remarks wryly that he \\"better stay dead\\". Meanwhile, Kendig sneaks away from a deteriorating building on the edge of the airfield, using a barrel of used engine oil to dispose of the remote control he had used to fly and destroy the biplane. He and Isobel set out for a few weeks in the south of France. Months later, Kendig's explosive memoir (also titled Hopscotch) has become an international bestseller. Disguised as a Sikh and speaking with a British accent, Kendig buys a copy of his own book in a local bookstore, much to Isobel's complete exasperation with his disguises.

Notable examples include the aria \\"Non Più Andrai\\" from the opera The Marriage of Figaro, the andante movement from Eine kleine Nachtmusik, the first movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata No.11, K331 (best known for the third movement, the Rondo alla turca), the Posthorn Serenade, K320 and a Rondo in D, K382. In the Hopscotch - Criterion Collection DVD special feature \\"Introduction by Neame & Garfield\\", director Neame stated that Matthau's agent made the suggestion that they put in some Mozart because this would greatly please Matthau. As they looked into this, they realized that it would enhance the movie if Kendig loved Mozart. Ian Fraser was the arranger and found many sections of Mozart that fit the movie, but they could not find anything to go with Kendig typing. They asked Matthau; he brought in some Mozart that went perfectly with it. Hermann Prey's singing of \\"Non Più Andrai\\" highlights the antics of the old biplane as Myerson is shooting at it. The song tells how Cherubino (\\"little baby\\"), going into the army, will no longer be a dainty favorite, just as 5-foot-7 Myerson is going to lose his power at the CIA. Also, the song describes bullets flying and even bombs exploding. There is also the aria \\"Largo al Factotum\\" from the opera The Barber of Seville by Gioachino Rossini. Matthau sings this as he passes a border checkpoint. The words to the aria explain how everyone is looking for the barber, and he moves fast like lightning. Kendig has the aria \\"Un Bel Dì Vedremo\\" (\\"One Beautiful Day\\") from Madame Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini playing loudly on the stereo as the FBI and CIA shoot up Myerson's wife's house. The operatic contrapunto adds a surreal air of ironic justice to the events as Madame Butterfly sings how she will hide from her husband. The credits also list \\"Once a Night\\" written by Jackie English and Beverly Bremers. This is the blaring song playing at the bar \\"The Other End\\" where Matthau goes to arrange his flight from Georgia. Casting According to Neame in the special feature \\"Introduction by Neame & Garfield\\", the Jewish Matthau refused to film on location in Germany, as he had lost many relatives in the Holocaust. However, he wanted to have Neame cast his son David and later his stepdaughter Lucy Saroyan, so Matthau gave in. David Matthau played the CIA agent Kendig takes prisoner after leaving Myerson's house and Saroyan the pilot who takes Kendig to Bermuda. According to Neame, he did not think they could get Glenda Jackson, but she and Matthau had previously worked together in the 1978 film House Calls, and she was delighted with the prospect of reteaming with him. Filming Hopscotch was filmed in many locations in Europe and the United States, including London, United Kingdom; Marseilles, France; Bermuda; Washington, D.C.; Savannah, Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia; and Munich, in then-West Germany. Locations in Salzburg, Austria, included The Mirabell Platz. The scenes set during Munich’s Oktoberfest were filmed using eight cameras concealed in strategic locations at the Munich Fairgrounds. Financing IFI and the Landaus raised money from cinema chains, which later caused problems with distribution for the film. IFI wanted Goldcrest Films to invest, as they had on The Howling and Escape from New York but David Puttnam persuaded the Goldcrest board otherwise. The film earned $20 million, including $9 million in rentals. Jack Eberts claimed IFI did not make money on the film. Differences between novel and film Garfield's original script reflected the dark tone of the novel. At one point, Warren Beatty and Jane Fonda were in line for the leads. Matthau agreed to appear on condition that Garfield rework the script to play to his own gifts as an actor. Matthau and Neame participated in the rewrites, which continued throughout the film. The AFI catalog refers to a Hollywood Reporter article describing two of Matthau's significant contributions: the ending, in which Kendig disguises himself as a Sikh in order to visit a bookshop, and the scene in a Salzburg restaurant where Kendig and Isobel, apparently strangers, strike up a conversation about wine that reveals more and more about them and ends in a passionate kiss. The original scene relied on a great deal of exposition to bring the audience up to date. Neame said that Matthau contributed so much to the final film that he could have asked for credit, but that was never pursued. The endings are very different. In the novel, Kendig fakes his own death using a body recovered from a Paris street and includes all copies of his manuscript, ensuring it will never be published. In the film, his escape airplane explodes in mid-air just as it heads over the English Channel and no body is recovered. His exposé is published and is a great success. Both works include a knowing nod from Cutter indicating that he is sure that Kendig is alive but hopes that he will stay dead. The character of Isobel, Kendig's old flame, provides a romantic interest in the film. In the novel, his feelings for a hired pilot, prove to him that he will find a new life outside the world of spycraft. Reception Matthau was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance as Miles Kendig. New York Times critic Vincent Canby gave the film a rave review: “..a lark, a comic cloak- and-dagger adventure... a stylish, lighter-than-air vehicle that moves from Munich to Salzburg to Washington to the Deep South to Europe and back without once losing its breath. It is beautifully played by Mr. Matthau and Miss Jackson and by a supporting cast.. directed by Ronald Neame and scored largely by Mozart. My only reservation is that Miss Jackson isn't on the screen enough...” At the time of its release, film critic Roger Ebert described the movie as “a picaresque comedy disguised as a thriller.” “A shaggy-dog thriller that never really thrills us very much, but leaves a nice feeling when it's over... partly because of the way Walter Matthau fools around with dialogue... and partly because the movie's shot at a measured, civilized, whimsical pace. It's a strange thing to say about a thriller, but Hopscotch is . . . pleasant.“ TCM's Susan Doll observes: “For the most part, critical reaction to Hopscotch is dependent on the age of the reviewer...” contrasting the reactions of “critics (who) understand... its value as a vehicle for Matthau, the appeal of a literate script, and the craftsmanship behind Neame's measured style,” and the responses of “Contemporary reviewers, accustomed to the violence of spy dramas and the fast pace of action films, (who) tend to be critical of its fluffy plot, dry humor, and lack of action scenes.” As of June 2020, Rotten Tomatoes tomatometer gives the film a rating of 73% based on 15 reviews: “As written by Brian Garfield, Hopscotch was a conventionally serious espionage novel. As adapted for the big screen by Garfield and Bryan Forbes, Hopscotch is a lively exercise in cloak-and-dagger comedy, even when the pursuit of Matthau turns deadly towards the end.” Writing for Criterion in 2002, Bruce Eder opens his long assessment of the film with the statement that it “has the distinction of being the only 'feel-good' realistic spy film ever made. As the movie walks a fine line between serious drama and satirical comedy, and between topicality and escapism, it beguiles the viewer with its sophistication and complexity. The most surprising aspect of Hopscotch, however, may not be how well it walks that tightrope, but that its makers accomplished this balancing act in an era that saw the spy movie genre reduced to tales of relentless despair...”  Legacy  The series finale of Homeland paid tribute to Hopscotch by penultimately concluding with the publication of a CIA tell-all by the show's protagonist, Carrie, exactly as Hopscotch finally concluded, with the publication of Kendig's CIA tell-all while he is in hiding. In season 8, episode 3 \\"False Friends\\" Yevgeny and Claire meet for a private meeting. The former, brings drinks and represents the Russian intelligence community and the latter, Carrie, the American one. This meeting is monitored by a colleague of the American in the meeting.

His passion for opera led him to open several opera houses, and he rekindled opera's popularity in America. He was the grandfather of American lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II and the father of theater manager William Hammerstein and American producer Arthur Hammerstein. Early life Oscar Hammerstein I was born in Stettin (capital of the province of Pomerania), Kingdom of Prussia (now Szczecin, Poland), to German Jewish parents Abraham and Berthe Hammerstein. He took up the flute, piano, and violin at an early age. His mother died when he was fifteen years old. During his youth, Hammerstein's father wanted him to continue with his education and to specialize in subjects such as algebra, but Hammerstein wanted to pursue music. After Oscar went skating in a park one day, his father found out and whipped him as punishment, goading Hammerstein to flee his family. With the proceeds from the sale of his violin, Hammerstein purchased a ticket to Liverpool,\\"Oscar Hammerstein.\\" Jewish Virtual Library. The American- Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, 2012. 4 March 2012 from which he departed on a three-month-long cruise to the United States, arriving in New York City in 1864. Cigar manufacturer Hammerstein made ends meet initially by working at a cigar factory on Pearl Street. He worked his way up to become a cigar maker himself, and also founded the U.S Tobacco Journal. Hammerstein would eventually become the owner of at least 80 patents, with most of them being related to the machines he made for the cigar-making process. Hammerstein's best-known contribution to the cigar-making process was adding an air- suctioning component to cigar rollers, enabling them to hold down tobacco leaves more firmly so the leaves could be cut more cleanly.\\"Grand Opera Built on Smoke.\\" The New York Times (1857–1922): SM5. via: ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851–2008). 18 November 1906. 5 March 2012. The initial machine only sold for $6,000, but subsequent improvements boosted its value to $200,000. Another invention of Hammerstein's was a more efficient plumbing system after his kitchen sink sprang a leak. He became wealthy industrializing cigar manufacturing, and his tobacco fortune provided the money he used to pursue his theater interests. Producer and impresario Hammerstein built his first theater, the Harlem Opera House, on 125th Street in 1889, along with 50 housing developments. His second theater, the Columbus Theatre, was built in 1890 on the same street, featuring light theatrical productions. His third theater was the first Manhattan Opera House, built in 1893 on 34th Street. This failed as an opera house and was used, in partnership with Koster and Bial, to present variety shows. Hammerstein was displeased with the partnership to the point that it fell into bitterness: \\"When I get through with you, everybody will forget there ever was a Koster and Bial. I will build a house the likes of which has never been seen in the whole world.\\"\\"Grand Opera Built on Smoke.\\" The New York Times (1857–1922): SM5. via: ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851–2008). 18 November 1906. 5 March 2012. In 1895 he opened a fourth venue, the Olympia Theatre, on Longacre Square, where he presented a comic opera that he wrote himself, Santa Maria (1896). While it was positively received by The New York Times, Hammerstein's personal experience was less than peaceful, with the production being plagued by monetary issues with the cast and stage set. In the end, Hammerstein had profited only one-tenth of the costs that were put into the Santa Maria production.Sheehan, Vincent. Oscar Hammerstein I. The Life and Exploits of an Impresario. (1956). Jewish Social Studies, 18, 310 Nine years later, Longacre Square was renamed Times Square, and the area had become, through his efforts, a thriving theater district. Hammerstein built three more theaters there, the Victoria Theatre (1899), which turned to vaudeville presentation in 1904 and was managed by his son, Willie Hammerstein before closing in 1915; the Theatre Republic was built in 1900 and leased to eccentric producer David Belasco, in 1901, and the Lew Fields Theatre for Lew Fields (half of the Vaudeville team Weber and Fields, and the father of lyricist Dorothy Fields), in 1904. He wrote a musical called Punch, Judy & Co. in 1903. Hammerstein also opened Hammerstein's Paradise Roof Garden above the Victoria and Republic theatres. Opera and later years Oscar Hammerstein I (left) with conductor Cleofonte Campanini in New York, 1908. In 1906, Hammerstein, dissatisfied with the Metropolitan Opera's productions, opened an eighth theater, his second Manhattan Opera House, to directly (and successfully) compete with it. He also opened the Philadelphia Opera House in 1908, which, however, he sold early in 1910.\\"Philadelphia Opera House\\" at the New International Encyclopedia He produced contemporary operas and presented the American premieres of Louise, Pelleas et Melisande, Elektra, Le jongleur de Notre-Dame, Thaïs, and Salome, as well as the American debuts of Mary Garden and Luisa Tetrazzini. Since the star soprano Nellie Melba was disenchanted with the Metropolitan, she deserted it for Hammerstein's company, rescuing it financially with a successful season. He also produced the successful Victor Herbert operetta Naughty Marietta in 1910. Hammerstein became famous during his opera years for putting noticeably large budgets out for his productions, Santa Maria being one example. More often than not, he would fall into financial trouble within a short period of time. The New York Times conducted an interview with Hammerstein, and when the interviewer asked him about his financial habits, Hammerstein responded: > Financially, I never undertake anything without plenty of ammunition. I am > never afraid of being ambushed in this account. I decided that my > preliminary contracts should be drawn up provisionally upon my success in > securing the great stars. I always contemplated an honorable > retreat.\\"Hammerstein Tells how to Start an Opera Company.\\" The New York > Times (1857–1922): X5. via: ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York > Times (1851–2008). May 6, 1906. 6 March 2012 In the end, Hammerstein's high-quality productions were ultimately too expensive to sustain, and by his fourth opera season, he was going bankrupt. The costs at the Metropolitan, too, were skyrocketing, as the Metropolitan spent more and more in order to effectively compete. Hammerstein's son Arthur negotiated a payment of $1.2 million from the Metropolitan in exchange for an agreement not to produce grand opera in the United States for 10 years. With this money, Hammerstein built his tenth theater, the London Opera House, in London, where he again entered competition with an established opera house, Covent Garden's Royal Opera House. He had run through his money in two years and thereupon returned to America. During a trip to Paris, a special cable was sent to him out of curiosity asking whether he wanted to quit opera in New York, given that during his 1909/1910 opera seasons in New York and Philadelphia, Hammerstein had failed in successfully maintaining audiences in his two venues in each city. He simply responded by saying, \\"[Opera in New York is] what I'm here for. I can't say anymore.\\"\\"Before Hammerstein Heard.\\" The New York Times (1857–1922): 2. via: ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851–2008). 28 April 1910. 5 March 2012. With money obtained selling the sole booking rights to the Victoria Theatre, he built his eleventh and final theatre, the Lexington Opera House. Unable to present opera there, he opened it as a movie theatre, selling it shortly thereafter. On 28 April 1910, Hammerstein officially ended producing opera, opting to solely focus on dramatic productions. All of his contracts and buildings of operation were turned over to the Metropolitan Opera Company.\\"Quits Opera for Good\\", The New York Times (1857–1922): 9. via: ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851–2008). 29 April 1910. 5 March 2012. Hammerstein's first wife was Rosa (Rose) Blau. After Rosa died, he married Melvina Jacobi, who was born in New York City. The marriage took place on 7 December 1879 in Montgomery, Alabama. Melvina's parents, Henrietta and Simon Jacobi, were Jews from Bavaria (possibly Grünstadt) who settled in New Orleans, Louisiana and, later, Montgomery, Alabama. Melvina and Oscar had two daughters – Rose and Estella (Stella). Legal problems Stella Hammerstein Late in his career, Hammerstein experienced numerous legal setbacks, most of them pertaining to ownership of his opera houses, which he endured stoically. One of his more infamous accusations was from a Frances Lee, an opera singer, who accused him of preventing her from singing in the Manhattan Opera House after one performance. Hammerstein was found not guilty and settled his possible payment for up to $35.\\"Did i Write?

Hammerstein had given his two daughters, Stella and Rose Hammerstein, $200 a week for financial support after the death of his first wife. The payments were given to them by the Equitable Trust Company securely in exchange for stock shares in Hammerstein's Victoria Theatre. In 1912, Hammerstein requested his stocks back from the company and chose to no longer pay for his daughters. Stella and Rose sought to fight against their father, who believed that they could support themselves on their own. Infamously, he compared paying his daughters to \\"the eccentricities and actions of the late lamented King Lear.\\"\\"Hammerstein Wont Support Daughters.\\" The New York Times (1857–1922): 1. via: ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851–2008). 9 October 1912. 5 March 2012. Death and legacy Hammerstein contracted kidney problems and paralysis, eventually permanently falling into a coma. He died in 1919 in Lenox Hill Hospital at Park Avenue and 77th Street in Manhattan. His contractual ban on presenting opera was due to expire in 1920; at his death he was busy planning his return to the opera stage. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in New York City. A 1910 song by Jack Norworth entitled \\"For Months and Months and Months\\" mentions Hammerstein in its first stanza. The Manhattan Opera House was bid for $145,000 by Hammerstein's two daughters. They would also sue Hammerstein's third wife, Emma Swift Hammerstein, over money and ownership of the building. Emma Hammerstein would go to court claiming ownership through Hammerstein Opera Company stock, but the stocks were found to be null and void by the judge.\\"Manhattan Opera House is Auctioned.\\" The New York Times (1857–1922): 27. via: ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851–2008). 23 June 1921. 5 March 2012.

A system of titles and honours of Spain and of the former kingdoms that constitute it make up the Spanish nobility. Some nobles possess various titles that may be inherited, but the creation and recognition of titles is legally a prerogative of the King of Spain. Many noble titles and families still exist which have transmitted that status since time immemorial. Some aristocratic families use the nobiliary particle de before their family name, although this was more prominent before the 20th century. During the rule of Generalísimo Francisco Franco, some new hereditary titles were conferred on individuals, and the titles granted by the Carlist pretenders were officially recognised. Despite the accession to the throne of Spain by Juan Carlos I in 1975, the court of nobles holding positions and offices attached to the Royal Household was not restored. Noble titleholders are subjected to taxation, whereas under Spain's ancien régime (until 1923) . they were exempt. King Juan Carlos resumed conferral of titles to recognize those whose public service, artistic endeavour, personal achievement, philanthropy, etc., are deemed to have benefitted the Spanish nation. Spanish nobility today Palacio de Liria in Madrid, home of the Dukes of Alba. As of 2019, there are approximately 2,237 nobles in Spain and 400 Grandes de España, with 3,200 total titles of Spanish nobility. Some nobles may carry more than one title of nobility. Many are active in the worlds of business, finance, and technology, with some taking on leadership roles in major IBEX 35 companies, some of Spain's largest companies. Examples include the president of FCC, Esther Alcocer Koplowitz, 9th Marchioness of Casa Peñalver, or Alfonso Martínez de Irujo Fitz-James Stuart, Duke of Híjar and Count of Aranda, president of IE Law School in Madrid.https://elpais.com/economia/2019/09/19/actualidad/1568884329_726800.htmlhttps://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2304533/0/titulos- nobiliarios/tipos-jerarquia/privilegios/ Legal situation In Spain today, the possession of a title of nobility does not imply any legal or fiscal privilege; On the contrary, the possession of titles of nobility is subject to the payment of a normal level of taxation. It is a distinction of merely honorary and symbolic character, accompanied by the treatment of the most excellent lord for those titles that possess the dignity of grandees of Spain and of illustrious lords for others. The last privilege, suppressed in 1984, was the right to a diplomatic passport by the grandees of Spain (Grandes de España). This privilege disappeared by Royal Decree 1023/1984. The titles without the rank of grandee of Spain never enjoyed this privilege. With the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, the use of noble titles was abolished by way of Decree of 1 June 1931,https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1931/153/A01122-01123.pdf ratified by Law of 30 December of the same year.https://boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1932/008/A00210-00211.pdf In 1948, legal recognition of the usage of noble titles was provided for by Law of 4 May 1948 restoring the rules as they were before 14 April 1931.https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1948-3512 At present, titles of nobility find their legal basis in article 62, section f, of the 1978 constitution, which grants the prerogative of the king to grant honors and distinctions in accordance with the laws. Spanish legislation recognizes titles of nobility and protects their legal owners against third parties. The Spanish nobility titles are in no case susceptible of purchase or sale, since their succession is strictly reserved for blood relatives of better right of the first holder of the title. The successions are processed by the Ministry of Justice and their use is subject to their respective tax.

In the past, grandees were divided into first, second, and third classes, but this division has ceased to be relevant in practice while remaining a titular distinction; legally all grandees enjoy the same privileges in modern times. At one time however, each class held special privileges such as: # those who spoke to the king and received his reply with their heads covered. # those who addressed the king uncovered, but put on their hats to hear his answer. # those who awaited the permission of the king before covering themselves. Additionally, all grandees were addressed by the king as mi Primo (my Cousin), whereas ordinary nobles were only qualified as mi Pariente (my Kinsman). An individual may hold a grandeeship, whether in possession of a title of nobility or not. Normally, however, each grandeeship is attached to a title. A grandeeship is always attached to the grant of a ducal title. The grant of a grandeeship with any other rank of nobility has always been at the will of the sovereign. Excepting dukes and some very ancient titles of marquesses and counts, most Spanish titles of nobility are not attached to grandeeships. A grandee of any rank outranks a non-grandee, even if that non-grandee's title is of a higher degree, with the exception of official members of the Spanish Royal Family who may in fact hold no title at all. Thus, a baron-grandee enjoys higher precedence than a marquess who is not a grandee. Since 1987, the children of Spanish infantes, traditionally considered part of the royal family, have been entitled to the rank and style of a grandee but do not hold the legal dignity of grandee unless a grandeza is officially conferred by the sovereign; once the dignity has been officially bestowed, it becomes hereditary. Some notable titles, which are attached to grandeeships, are: Duke of Alba, Duke of Medinaceli, Duke of Osuna, Duke of Infantado, Duke of Albuquerque, Duke of Nájera, Duke of Frías and Duke of Medina Sidonia, Marquess of Aguilar de Campoo, Marquess of Astorga, Marquess of Santillana, Marquess of Los Vélez, Count of Benavente, Count of Lerín, Count of Olivares, Count of Oñate, and Count of Lemos. Form of address Dukes, Grandees, their spouses and heirs are entitled to the honorific style of The Most Excellent Lord/Lady. Titled nobles without a Grandee, their spouses and offspring use the style of The Most Illustrious Lord/Lady. Ranks The ordinary Spanish nobility is divided into six ranks. From highest to lowest, these are: Duque (Duke), Marqués (Marquess), Conde (Count), Vizconde (Viscount), Barón (Baron), and Señor (Lord) (as well as the feminine forms of these titles). Nobility descends from the first man of a family who was raised to the nobility (or recognized as belonging to the hereditary nobility) to all his legitimate descendants, male and female, in the male line. Thus, most persons who are legally noble, hold no noble title. Hereditary titles formerly descended by male-preference primogeniture, a woman being eligible to inherit only if she had no brother or if her brothers also inherited titles. However, by Spanish law, all hereditary titles descend by absolute primogeniture, gender no longer being a criterion for preference in inheritance, since 2005. Princes Leonor, Princess of Asturias, heir presumptive to the Spanish throne The often overlooked title of 'prince' (príncipe/princesa) has historically been borne by those who have been granted or have inherited that title. It is often not included in lists of the Spanish nobility because it is rare. Prince/Princess are English translations of Infante/Infanta, referring to the son or daughter of a king; such titles are reserved for members of the royal family (the heir to the throne or the consort of the Queen regnant). Historically, infante or infanta could refer to offspring, siblings, uncles and aunts of a king. The heir's princely titles derive from the ancient kingdoms which united to form Spain. Three titles of prince are held by the heir to the Spanish throne. * Prince of Asturias as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of Castile and León. * Prince of Girona as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of Aragon. * Prince of Viana as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of Navarre. Other titles of 'prince' were frequently granted by the kings of Spain, but usually in their capacity as kings of Naples or of Sicily. Such nobles often sojourned at the Spanish court where their titles were acknowledged, but rarely were Spanish nobles the recipients of a title of prince in Spain. The most notable exceptions were the title Prince of the Peace conferred in 1795 on Manuel Godoy, a favourite of the Spanish king and the title Prince of Vergara conferred to Baldomero Espartero. And Joseph Bonaparte conferred the title to be hereditary on his grandchildren in both the male and female line, Although legislation of the twentieth century ended official recognition of the title of prince outside the royal bloodline family, it did allow the holder of a princedom to have the dignity converted to a ducal title of the same name.

However, they did exist in the Kingdom of Aragon, such as: *Baron of Polop Lord/Lady (Señor/Señora) (Don/Doña) The title of Señor is, together with that of Conde, the oldest in seniority of the Spanish realms. Many of these lordships are among the oldest titles of nobility in Spain, and the Señor usually exercised military and administrative powers over the lordship. Although some lordships were created by the kings of Spain, others existed before them and have not been created by any known king. For example, the Señor of Biscay held a great degree of independence from the king of Castile, to whom he could pledge or not pledge feudal allegiance, but of whom he was not automatically a vassal: each new lord of Biscay had to renew his oath to the king. Ultimately however, the kings of Castile inherited the lordship. Besides those held by the King, in Spain remain seven lordships that maintain the official consideration of Titles of the Kingdom according to the Official Guide of the Titles and Grandees of the Kingdom published by the Ministry of Justice: the Lordship of Solar de Tejada, the Lordship of Solar de Mandayona y Villaseca, the Lordship of Alconchel, the Lordship of Lazcano (with Grandee of Spain), the Lordship of Rubianes (with Grandee of Spain), the Lordship of Higuera de Vargas (with Grandee of Spain), the Lordship of Meirás (with Grandee of Spain) and the Lordship of Sonseca. Other lordships that were considered as Titles of the Kingdom in the past, have not been rehabilitated. *Lord of Alconchel *Lord of Balaguer, held by the King of Spain *Lord of Benafarces y Lobones *Lord of Biscay, held by the Spanish monarchy since 1378, when merged with the previously semi-independent lordship of Biscay *Lord of Cameros *Lord of Higuera de Vargas *Lord of Casa Lazcano *Lord of Lecubarri, held by the descendants of the Dukes of Gascony *Lord of Llafranc *Lord of Marcoartu *Lord of Meirás, señora de Meiras, Carmen Polo wife of Francisco Franco *Lord of Molina de Aragón, held by the King of Spain *Lord of Montalbo *Lord of Casa Rubianes *Lord of San Roque *Lord of Señorío of Mandayona y Villaseca *Lord of Solar de Tejada *Lord of Sonseca Other titles Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo, daughter of King Juan Carlos I *Infante: currently borne by royal princes, other than the heir apparent to the throne, who are sons of a Spanish king. *Knight of the Order of Charles III caballero de la Orden de Carlos III: the bestowal of the highest order of knighthood on an individual grants personal nobility and certain heraldic privileges such as a heraldic mantle. The King of Spain continues to bestow this honor. *Knight of the Royal Order of Isabella the Catholic caballero de la Orden de Isabel la Catolica: the bestowal of the second highest order of knighthood on an individual grants personal nobility and certain heraldic privileges such as a golden heraldic mantle. The King of Spain continues to bestow this honor. *Ricohombre (fem. Ricahembra): used during the Reconquista. By the 17th century, it was a synonym of nobleman. *Condestable: cognate with \\"constable\\", it was a hereditary title used in the kingdoms of Castile and León for the official second in authority to the king. It became hereditary in the Velasco family which, however, gradually lost the powers once attributed to the Condestable of Castile. *Caballero: equivalent to knight, it was very rare in the kingdom of Castile, but common in the kingdom of Aragon, where there were four types of caballeros: Golden-spur caballero: borne by those infanzones (descendants of one of the cadet branches of the kings of Aragon which did not inherit the throne) who had been knighted. They were the highest ranking knights. Royal-privilege caballero: a personal, non-hereditary title granted by the king to doctors of the law. It was rarely used by its holders, since the doctoral status enjoyed more privileges. Caballero Mesnadero: borne by the cadet sons of a Ricohombre. It fell into desuetude during the 18th century, when the Bourbon kings purged the ranks of the nobility. Caballero franco: borne by those of hijosdalgo or infanzone status, but who were commoner-born. *Potestad: borne only in the kingdom of Aragon, the equivalent of the Italian podestà, an administrative title. It disappeared with the Nueva Planta decrees in 1713. Lower nobility Lower nobility held ranks, without individual titles, such as infanzon (in Aragon, e.g. Latas Family), hidalgo or escudero. These did not, however, correspond to the status of a baron, a title unknown to Spanish nobility except in Catalonia. Hidalgo was the most common of these: Originally all the nobles in the Western Peninsular Christian Realms were hidalgos and, as cristianos viejos, held nearly exclusive right to privileged status (although there were some Jews and Muslims recognized as hidalgos, who shared their privilege to bear arms as knights in the mesnada real). The first of the kings of Pamplona and Asturias were originally elected and lifted up on a shield to assume Princeps inter Pares status, by these otherwise untitled nobles. For approximately three hundred years the hidalgos retained this privilege, only a few of them eventually being granted the non-heritable title of Comes#Medieval usages. Unlike Spain's later titled nobles, the early hidalgo did not necessarily possess or receive any fief or land grant. Many were as poor as commoners, although they were tax-exempt and could join the civil service or the army. During the Middle Ages hidalgo became a title granted by the kings of Castile as a reward for service done to the crown (or, as in Biscay, as a way of recognizing prior rights). In the same way escudero was granted for military achievement when the Reconquista ended. Being the most obvious proof of noble descent, hidalgo came to be the only lesser title to remain among the modern ranks of Spanish nobility. From this ancient estate of the realm emerged Spain's nobility. All titled and untitled nobles are considered hidalgos, but many of the modern titled nobility do not descend from the original hidalguía. The term Hidalgo de Sangre indicated membership in a family whose noble status was recognized in the earliest records of its existence; thus its immemorial nobility was acknowledged but not created by any monarch. Succession Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, 18th Duchess of Alba (1926-2014), was the woman with the most titles of nobility in the world.https://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/20/inenglish/1416479431_740499.html The evidence supporting one's claim to a title may be reviewed by the Deputation of Grandees and Titled Nobles of the Kingdom (Diputación de Grandes y Títulos del Reino). The body includes eight grandees, eight nobles who are not grandees, and a president who must hold both a grandeeship and a hereditary title unattached to a grandeeship. Succession to Spanish noble titles is hereditary, but not automatic. The original letters patent which created the title determine the order of succession. Payment of substantial fees is required whenever a title is inherited. While noble titles historically have followed the rule of male-preference primogeniture, a Spanish law came into effect on October 30, 2006, after approval by both houses of the Cortes, establishing the inheritance of hereditary noble titles by the firstborn regardless of gender. The law is retroactive to July 27, 2005. Following the death of a noble, the senior heir may petition the sovereign through the Spanish Ministry of Justice for permission to use the title. If the senior heir does not make a petition within two years, then other potential heirs may do so on their own behalf. There is a limit of forty years from the vacancy by death or relinquishment of a title within which that title may be claimed and revived by an heir. The petitioner must demonstrate that he or she is a child, grandchild or direct male line descendant of a noble (whether a grandee or not), or that he or she belongs to certain bodies or orders of chivalry deemed noble, or that the father's family is recognized as noble. The amount of fees due depend on whether the title is attached to a grandeeship or not, and on whether the heir is a direct descendant or a collateral kinsman of the previous holder. The petition is normally granted, except if the petitioner is a criminal. Titles may also be ceded to heirs other than the senior heir, during the lifetime of the main titleholder. Normally, this process is used to allow younger children to succeed to lesser titles, while the highest or principal title goes to the senior heir. Only subsidiary titles may be ceded; the principal title must be reserved for the senior heir. The cession of titles may only be done with the approval of the monarch. The late Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, 18th Duchess of Alba (1926–2014) holds the Guinness World Record for number of titles with over 50 titles. Before her death, she ceded some of her titles to each of her six children; otherwise, all but the eldest would have been excluded from succession.  Titles created during the reign of King Juan Carlos  From the beginning of his reign in November 1975, King Juan Carlos created new titles for about 51 people (as of April 2011),\\"Nobiliario Español\\" : Titles and Grandeeships conferred by Juan Carlos I., with actual holders. among others recognizing the merits of politicians and artists. Some of these dignities have been hereditary. Examples include: * Carmen Franco y Polo, daughter of dictator Francisco Franco, created 1st Duchess of Franco and Grandee of Spain in 1975 * Carlos Arias Navarro, Prime Minister, created 1st Marquess of Arias Navarro and Grandee of Spain in 1976 * Torcuato Fernández-Miranda, Prime Minister, created 1st Duke of Fernandez-Miranda and Grandee of Spain in 1977 * Adolfo Suárez, Prime Minister, created 1st Duke of Suárez and Grandee of Spain in 1981 * Andrés Segovia, classical guitarist, created 1st Marquess of Salobreña in 1981 * Salvador Dalí, surrealist painter, created 1st Marquess of Dalí de Púbol in 1982 * Joaquín Rodrigo, composer and pianist, created 1st Marquess of los Jardines de Aranjuez in 1991 * Juan Antonio Samaranch, President of the International Olympic Committee, created 1st Marquess of Samaranch and Grandee of Spain in 1991 * Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado, officer and politician, created 1st Marquess of Gutiérrez-Mellado in 1994 * Camilo José Cela, author and Nobel laureate, created 1st Marquess of Iria Flavia in 1996 * Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, Prime Minister, created 1st Marquess of the Ría of Ribadeo and Grandee of Spain in 2002 * Margarita Salas, scientist, created 1st Marchioness of Canero in 2008 * Paloma O'Shea Artiñano, pianist, created Marchioness of O'Shea in 2008 * José Ángel Sánchez Asiaín, an international banker, created 1st Marquess of Asiaín in 2010 * Antoni Tàpies, painter, created 1st Marquess of Tàpies in 2010 * Vicente del Bosque, football manager, created 1st Marquess of Del Bosque in 2011 * Mario Vargas Llosa, author and Nobel laureate, created 1st Marquess of Vargas Llosa in 2011. King Juan Carlos also exceptionally confirmed the title of Count of Barcelona, a title historically attached to the Crown, but used as a title of pretence by his father, Infante Juan, during the dynasty's 20th century exile and the subsequent reign of his son.

Software patents cover a wide range of topics and there is therefore important debate about whether such subject-matter should be excluded from patent protection. However, there is no official way of identifying software patents and different researchers have devised their own ways of doing so. This article lists patents relating to software which have been the subject of litigation or have achieved notoriety in other ways. Notable patent applications are also listed and comparisons made between corresponding patents and patent applications in different countries. The patents and patent applications are categorised according to the subject matter of the patent or the particular field in which the patent had an effect that brought it into the public view.

Outside Poland he is known chiefly for his novel, The Manuscript Found in Saragossa.Count Jan Potocki: The Saragossa Manuscript. Book review by Anthony Campbell (2001). Retrieved September 22, 2011. Life Jan Potocki was born into the Potocki aristocratic family, that owned vast estates across Poland. He was educated in Geneva and Lausanne, served twice in the Polish Army as a captain of engineers, and spent some time on a galley as novice to the Knights of Malta. His colorful life took him across Europe, Asia and North Africa, where he embroiled himself in political intrigues, flirted with secret societies and contributed to the birth of ethnology – he was one of the first to study the precursors of the Slavic peoples from a linguistic and historical standpoint. Retrieved September 22, 2011. In 1790 he became the first person in Poland to fly in a hot air balloon when he made an ascent over Warsaw with the aeronaut Jean-Pierre Blanchard, an exploit that earned him great public acclaim. He spent some time in France, and upon his return to Poland, he became a known publicist, publishing newspapers and pamphlets, in which he argued for various reforms. He also established in 1788 in Warsaw a publishing house named Drukarnia Wolna (Free Press) as well as the city's first free reading room. His relation with the King Stanisław II August was thorny, as Potocki, while often supportive of the King, on occasion did not shy from his critique. He was highly critical of the Russian ambassador, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg. Potocki's wealth enabled him to travel extensively about Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia, visiting Italy, Sicily, Malta, the Netherlands, Germany, France, England, Russia, Turkey, Dalmatia, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Spain, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and even Mongolia. He was also one of the first travel writers of the modern era, penning lively accounts of many of his journeys, during which he also undertook extensive historical, linguistic, and ethnographic studies. Potocki married twice and had five children. His first marriage ended in divorce, and both marriages were the subject of scandalous rumors. In 1812, disillusioned and in poor health, he retired to his estate at Uładówka in Podolia, suffering from \\"melancholia\\" (which today would probably be diagnosed as depression), and during the last few years of his life he completed his novel. Believing he was becoming a werewolf, Potocki committed suicide by fatally shooting himself with a silver bullet that he had had blessed by his village priest in December 1815, at the age of 54. The Manuscript Found in Saragossa Jan Potocki, by Anton Graff, 1785 Potocki's most famous work, originally written in French, is The Manuscript Found in Saragossa (Manuscrit trouvé à Saragosse). It is a frame tale. On account of its rich, interlocking structure, and telescoping story sequences, the novel has drawn comparisons to such celebrated works as the Decameron and the Arabian Nights. The book's title is explained in the foreword, which is narrated by an unnamed French officer who describes his fortuitous discovery of an intriguing Spanish manuscript during the sack of Zaragoza in 1809, in the course of the Napoleonic Wars. Soon after, the French officer is captured by the Spanish and stripped of his possessions; but a Spanish officer recognizes the manuscript's importance, and during the French officer's captivity the Spaniard translates it for him into French. The manuscript has been written by a young officer of the Walloon Guard, Alphonse van Worden. In 1739, while en route to Madrid to serve with the Spanish Army, he is diverted into Spain's rugged Sierra Morena region. There, over a period of sixty-six days, he encounters a varied group of characters, including Muslim princesses, Gypsies, outlaws, and cabbalists, who tell him an intertwining series of bizarre, amusing, and fantastic tales which he records in his diary. The sixty-six stories cover a wide range of themes, subjects, and styles, including gothic horror, picaresque adventures, and comic, erotic, and moral tales. The stories reflect Potocki's interest in secret societies, the supernatural, and oriental cultures, and they are illustrated with his detailed observations of 18th-century European manners and customs, particularly those of upper-class Spanish society. Many of the locations described in the tales are real places and regions which Potocki would have visited during his travels, while others are fictionalized accounts of actual places. While there is still some dispute about the novel's authorship, it is now generally accepted to have indeed been written by Potocki. He began writing it in the 1790s and completed it in 1814, a year before his death, though the novel's structure is thought to have been fully mapped out by 1805. The novel was never published in its entirety during Potocki's lifetime. A proof edition of the first ten \\"days\\" was circulated in Saint Petersburg in 1805, and a second extract was published in Paris in 1813, almost certainly with Potocki's permission. A third publication, combining both earlier extracts, was issued in 1814, but it appears that at the time of his death Potocki had not yet decided on the novel's final form. Potocki composed the book entirely in the French language. Sections of the original manuscripts were later lost, but have survived in a Polish translation that was made in 1847 by Edmund Chojecki from a complete French copy, now lost. The most recent and complete French-language version, edited by François Rosset and Dominique Triaire, was published in 2006 in Leuven, Belgium, as part of a critical scholarly edition of the complete works of Potocki. Unlike Radrizzani's 1989 edition of the Manuscript Found in Saragossa, Rosset and Triaire's edition has been based solely on Potocki's French-language manuscripts found in several libraries in France, Poland (in particular, previously unknown autograph pieces that they discovered in Poznań), Spain, and Russia, as well as in the private collection of Potocki's heirs. They identified two versions of the novel: one unfinished, of 1804, published in 1805, and the full version of 1810, which appears to have been completely reconceived in comparison to the 1804 version. Whereas the first version has a lighter, more sceptical tone, the second one tends towards a darker, more religious mood. In view of the differences between the two versions, the 1804 and 1810 versions have been published as two separate books; paperback editions were issued in early 2008 by Flammarion. The first English-language edition, published in 1995, was a translation of Radrizzani's edition by Oxford scholar Ian Maclean. Potocki's novel became more widely known in the West via the stylish black-and-white film adaptation made in Poland in 1965 as The Saragossa Manuscript (Rękopis znaleziony w Saragossie), directed by renowned filmmaker Wojciech Has and starring Zbigniew Cybulski as Alphonse van Worden.

Functionally, it is a cytokine and hormone, a type of colony- stimulating factor, and is produced by a number of different tissues. The pharmaceutical analogs of naturally occurring G-CSF are called filgrastim and lenograstim. G-CSF also stimulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of neutrophil precursors and mature neutrophils.  Biological function  G-CSF is produced by endothelium, macrophages, and a number of other immune cells. The natural human glycoprotein exists in two forms, a 174- and 177-amino-acid-long protein of molecular weight 19,600 grams per mole. The more-abundant and more-active 174-amino acid form has been used in the development of pharmaceutical products by recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology. ;White blood cells: The G-CSF-receptor is present on precursor cells in the bone marrow, and, in response to stimulation by G-CSF, initiates proliferation and differentiation into mature granulocytes. G-CSF stimulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of neutrophil precursors and mature neutrophils. G-CSF regulates them using Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and Ras/mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signal transduction pathway. ;hematopoietic system: G-CSF is also a potent inducer of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, although it has been shown that it does not directly affect the hematopoietic progenitors that are mobilized. ;Neurons: G-CSF can also act on neuronal cells as a neurotrophic factor. Indeed, its receptor is expressed by neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The action of G-CSF in the central nervous system is to induce neurogenesis, to increase the neuroplasticity and to counteract apoptosis. These properties are currently under investigations for the development of treatments of neurological diseases such as cerebral ischemia. Genetics The gene for G-CSF is located on chromosome 17, locus q11.2-q12. Nagata et al. found that the GCSF gene has 4 introns, and that 2 different polypeptides are synthesized from the same gene by differential splicing of mRNA. The 2 polypeptides differ by the presence or absence of 3 amino acids. Expression studies indicate that both have authentic GCSF activity. It is thought that stability of the G-CSF mRNA is regulated by an RNA element called the G-CSF factor stem-loop destabilising element.  Medical use  Chemotherapy induced neutropenia  Chemotherapy can cause myelosuppression and unacceptably low levels of white blood cells (leukopenia), making patients susceptible to infections and sepsis. G-CSF stimulates the production of granulocytes, a type of white blood cell. In oncology and hematology, a recombinant form of G-CSF is used with certain cancer patients to accelerate recovery and reduce mortality from neutropenia after chemotherapy, allowing higher-intensity treatment regimens. It is administered to oncology patients via subcutaneous or intravenous routes. A QSP model of neutrophil production and a PK/PD model of a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drug (Zalypsis) have been developed to optimize the use of G-CSF in chemotherapy regimens with the aim to prevent mild-neutropenia. G-CSF was first trialled as a therapy for neutropenia induced by chemotherapy in 1988. The treatment was well tolerated and a dose-dependent rise in circulating neutrophils was noted. A study in mice has shown that G-CSF may decrease bone mineral density. G-CSF administration has been shown to attenuate the telomere loss associated with chemotherapy. Use in drug-induced neutropenia Neutropenia can be a severe side effect of clozapine, an antipsychotic medication in the treatment of schizophrenia. G-CSF can restore neutrophil count. Following a return to baseline after stopping the drug, it may sometimes be safely rechallenged with the added use of G-CSF. Before blood donation G-CSF is also used to increase the number of hematopoietic stem cells in the blood of the donor before collection by leukapheresis for use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For this purpose, G-CSF appears to be safe in pregnancy during implantation as well as during the second and third trimesters. Breastfeeding should be withheld for 3 days after CSF administration to allow for clearance of it from the milk. People who have been administered colony- stimulating factors do not have a higher risk of leukemia than people who have not. Stem cell transplants G-CSF may also be given to the receiver in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, to compensate for conditioning regimens. Side effect The skin disease Sweet's syndrome is a known side effect of using this drug.  History  Mouse granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was first recognised and purified in Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Australia in 1983, and the human form was cloned by groups from Japan and Germany/United States in 1986. The FDA approved the first biosimilar of Neulasta in June 2018. It is made by Mylan and sold as Fulphila. Pharmaceutical variants The recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) synthesised in an E. coli expression system is called filgrastim. The structure of filgrastim differs slightly from the structure of the natural glycoprotein. Most published studies have used filgrastim. Filgrastim was first marketed by Amgen with the brand name Neupogen. Several bio-generic versions are now also available in markets such as Europe and Australia. Filgrastim (Neupogen) and PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta) are two commercially available forms of rhG-CSF. The PEG (polyethylene glycol) form has a much longer half-life, reducing the necessity of daily injections. Another form of rhG-CSF called lenograstim is synthesised in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO cells). As this is a mammalian cell expression system, lenograstim is indistinguishable from the 174-amino acid natural human G-CSF. No clinical or therapeutic consequences of the differences between filgrastim and lenograstim have yet been identified, but there are no formal comparative studies. Research G-CSF when given early after exposure to radiation may improve white blood cell counts, and is stockpiled for use in radiation incidents. Mesoblast planned in 2004 to use G-CSF to treat heart degeneration by injecting it into the blood-stream, plus SDF (stromal cell-derived factor) directly to the heart. G-CSF has been shown to reduce inflammation, reduce amyloid beta burden, and reverse cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Due to its neuroprotective properties, G-CSF is currently under investigation for cerebral ischemia in a clinical phase IIb and several clinical pilot studies are published for other neurological disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis A combination of human G-CSF and cord blood cells has been shown to reduce impairment from chronic traumatic brain injury in rats.

The area in between is called \\"Wallacea\\". Sundaland (also called the Sundaic region) is a biogeographical region of Southeastern Asia corresponding to a larger landmass that was exposed throughout the last 2.6 million years during periods when sea levels were lower. It includes the Malay Peninsula on the Asian mainland, as well as the large islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra and their surrounding small islands.  Extent  The area of Sundaland encompasses the Sunda Shelf, a tectonically stable extension of Southeast Asia's continental shelf that was exposed during glacial periods of the last 2 million years. The extent of the Sunda Shelf is approximately equal to the 120 meter isobath. In addition to the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra, it includes the Java Sea, the Gulf of Thailand, and portions of the South China Sea. In total, the area of Sundaland is approximately 1,800,000 km2. The area of exposed land in Sundaland has fluctuated considerably during the past recent 2 million years; the modern land area is approximately half of the maximum extent. The western and southern borders of Sundaland are clearly marked by the deeper waters of the Sunda Trench - some of the deepest in the world - and the Indian Ocean. The eastern boundary of Sundaland is the Wallace Line, identified by Alfred Russel Wallace as the eastern boundary of the range of Asia's land mammal fauna, and thus the boundary of the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. The islands east of the Wallace line are known as Wallacea, a separate biogeographical region that is considered part of Australasia. The Wallace Line corresponds to a deep-water channel that has never been crossed by any land bridges. The northern border of Sundaland is more difficult to define in bathymetric terms; a phytogeographic transition at approximately 9ºN is considered to be the northern boundary. Greater portions of Sundaland were most recently exposed during the last glacial period from approximately 110,000 to 12,000 years ago. When sea level was decreased by 30–40 meters or more, land bridges connected the islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra to the Malay Peninsula and mainland Asia. Because sea level has been 30 meters or more lower throughout much of the last 800,000 years, the current state of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra as islands has been a relatively rare occurrence throughout the Pleistocene. In contrast, sea level was higher during the late Pliocene, and the exposed area of Sundaland was smaller than what is observed at present. During the Last Glacial Maximum sea level fell by approximately 120 meters, and the entire Sunda Shelf was exposed.  Modern climate  All of Sundaland is within the tropics; the equator runs through central Sumatra and Borneo. Like elsewhere in the tropics, rainfall, rather than temperature, is the major determinant of regional variation. Most of Sundaland is classified as perhumid, or everwet, with over 2,000 millimeters of rain annually; rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration throughout the year and there are no predictable dry seasons like elsewhere in Southeast Asia. The warm and shallow seas of the Sunda Shelf (averaging 28 °C or more) are part of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool/Western Pacific Warm Pool and an important driver of the Hadley circulation and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), particularly in January when it is a major heat source to the atmosphere. ENSO also has a major influence on the climate of Sundaland; strong positive ENSO events result in droughts throughout Sundaland and tropical Asia.  Modern ecology  The high rainfall supports closed canopy evergreen forests throughout the islands of Sundaland, transitioning to deciduous forest and savanna woodland with increasing latitude. Remaining primary (unlogged) lowland forest is known for giant dipterocarp trees and orangutans; after logging, forest structure and community composition change to be dominated by shade intolerant trees and shrubs. Dipterocarps are notable for mast fruiting events, where tree fruiting is synchronized at unpredictable intervals resulting in predator satiation. Higher elevation forests are shorter and dominated by trees in the oak family. Botanists often include Sundaland, the adjacent Philippines, Wallacea and New Guinea in a single floristic province of Malesia, based on similarities in their flora, which is predominantly of Asian origin. During the last glacial period, sea levels were lower and all of Sundaland was an extension of the Asian continent. As a result, the modern islands of Sundaland are home to many Asian mammals including elephants, monkeys, apes, tigers, tapirs, and rhinoceros. The flooding of Sundaland separated species that had once shared the same environment. One example is the river threadfin (Polydactylus macrophthalmus, Bleeker 1858), which once thrived in a river system now called \\"North Sunda River\\" or \\"Molengraaff river\\".Maps of Pleistocene sea levels in Southeast Asia: Shorelines, river systems and time durations The fish is now found in the Kapuas River on the island of Borneo, and in the Musi and Batanghari rivers in Sumatra. Selective pressure (in some cases resulting in extinction) has operated differently on each of the islands of Sundaland, and as a consequence, a different assemblage of mammals is found on each island. However, the current species assemblage on each island is not simply a subset of a universal Sundaland or Asian fauna, as the species that inhabited Sundaland before flooding did not all have ranges encompassing the entire Sunda Shelf. Island area and number of terrestrial mammal species are positively correlated, with the largest islands of Sundaland (Borneo and Sumatra) having the highest diversity.

In an 1852 publication, English navigator George Windsor Earl advanced the idea of a \\"Great Asiatic Bank\\", based in part on common features of mammals found in Java, Borneo and Sumatra. Explorers and scientists began measuring and mapping the seas of Southeast Asia in the 1870s, primarily using depth sounding. In 1921 Gustaaf Molengraff, a Dutch geologist, postulated that the nearly uniform sea depths of the shelf indicated an ancient peneplain that was the result of repeated flooding events as ice caps melted, with the peneplain becoming more perfect with each successive flooding event. Molengraaf also identified ancient, now submerged, drainage systems that drained the area during periods of lower sea level. The name \\"Sundaland\\" for the peninsular shelf was first proposed by Reinout Willem van Bemmelen in his Geography of Indonesia in 1949, based on his research during the war. The ancient drainage systems described by Molengraff were verified and mapped by Tjia in 1980 and described in greater detail by Emmel and Curray in 1982 complete with river deltas, floodplains and backswamps.The physical geography of Southeast Asia by Avijit Gupta, 2005, , page 403  Data types  The climate and ecology of Sundaland throughout the Quaternary has been investigated by analyzing foraminiferal δ18O and pollen from cores drilled into the ocean bed, δ18O in speleothems from caves, and δ13C and δ15N in bat guano from caves, as well as species distribution models, phylogenetic analysis, and community structure and species richness analysis.  Climate  Perhumid climate has existed in Sundaland since the early Miocene; though there is evidence for several periods of drier conditions, a perhumid core persisted in Borneo. The presence of fossil coral reefs dating to the late Miocene and early Pliocene suggests that, as the Indian monsoon grew more intense, seasonality increased in some portions of Sundaland during these epochs. Palynological evidence from Sumatra suggests that temperatures were cooler during the late Pleistocene; mean annual temperatures at high elevation sites may have been as much as 5 °C cooler than present. Most recent research agrees that Indo-Pacific sea surface temperatures were at most 2-3 °C lower during the Last Glacial Maximum. Snow was found much lower than at present (approximately 1,000 meters lower) and there is evidence that glaciers existed on Borneo and Sumatra around 10,000 years before present. However, debate continues on how precipitation regimes changed throughout the Quaternary. Some authors argue that rainfall decreased with the area of ocean available for evaporation as sea levels fell with ice sheet expansion. Others posit that changes in precipitation have been minimal and an increase in land area in the Sunda Shelf alone (due to lowered sea level) is not enough to decrease precipitation in the region. One possible explanation for the lack of agreement on hydrologic change throughout the Quaternary is that there was significant heterogeneity in climate during the Last Glacial Maximum throughout Indonesia. Alternatively, the physical and chemical processes that underlie the method of inferring precipitation from δ18O records may have operated differently in the past. Some authors working primarily with pollen records have also noted the difficulties of using vegetation records to detect changes in precipitation regimes in such a humid environment, as water is not a limiting factor in community assemblage.  Ecology  Sundaland, and in particular Borneo, has been an evolutionary hotspot for biodiversity since the early Miocene due to repeated immigration and vicariance events. The modern islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra have served as refugia for the flora and fauna of Sundaland during multiple glacial periods in the last million years, and are serving the same role at present.  Savanna corridor theory  Dipterocarp trees characteristic of modern Southeast Asian tropical rainforest have been present in Sundaland since before the Last Glacial Maximum. There is also evidence for savanna vegetation, particularly in now submerged areas of Sundaland, throughout the last glacial period. However, researchers disagree on the spatial extent of savanna that was present in Sundaland. There are two opposing theories about the vegetation of Sundaland, particularly during the last glacial period: (1) that there was a continuous savanna corridor connecting modern mainland Asia to the islands of Java and Borneo, and (2) that the vegetation of Sundaland was instead dominated by tropical rainforest, with only small, discontinuous patches of savanna vegetation. The presence of a savanna corridor—even if fragmented—would have allowed for savanna-dwelling fauna (as well as early humans) to disperse between Sundaland and the Indochinese biogeographic region; emergence of a savanna corridor during glacial periods and subsequent disappearance during interglacial periods would have facilitated speciation through both vicariance (allopatric speciation) and geodispersal. Morley and Flenley (1987) and Heaney (1991) were the first to postulate the existence of a continuous corridor of savanna vegetation through the center of Sundaland (from the modern Malaysian Peninsula to Borneo) during the last glacial period, based on palynological evidence. Using the modern distribution of primates, termites, rodents, and other species, other researchers infer that the extent of tropical forest contracted—replaced by savanna and open forest —during the last glacial period. Vegetation models using data from climate simulations show varying degrees of forest contraction; Bird et al. (2005) noted that although no single model predicts a continuous savanna corridor through Sundaland, many do predict open vegetation between modern Java and southern Borneo. Combined with other evidence, they suggest that a 50–150 kilometer wide savanna corridor ran down the Malaysian Peninsula, through Sumatra and Java, and across to Borneo. Additionally, Wurster et al. (2010) analyzed stable carbon isotope composition in bat guano deposits in Sundaland and found strong evidence for the expansion of savanna in Sundaland. In contrast, other authors argue that Sundaland was primarily covered by tropical rainforest. Using species distribution models, Raes et al. (2014) suggest that Dipterocarp rainforest persisted throughout the last glacial period. Others have observed that the submerged rivers of the Sunda Shelf have obvious, incised meanders, which would have been maintained by trees on river banks. Pollen records from sediment cores around Sundaland are contradictory; for example, cores from highland sites suggest that forest cover persisted throughout the last glacial period, but other cores from the region show pollen from savanna-woodland species increasing through glacial periods. And in contrast to previous findings, Wurster et al. (2017) again used stable carbon isotope analysis of bat guano, but found that at some sites rainforest cover was maintained through much of the last glacial period. Soil type, rather than long-term existence of a savanna corridor, has also been posited as an explanation for species distribution differences within Sundaland; Slik et al. (2011) suggest that the sandy soils of the now submerged seabed are a more likely dispersal barrier.  Paleofauna  Before Sundaland emerged during the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene (~2.4 million years ago), there were no mammals on Java. As sea level lowered, species such as the dwarf elephantoid Sinomastodon bumiajuensis colonized Sundaland from mainland Asia. Later fauna included tigers, Sumatran rhinoceros, and Indian elephant, which were found throughout Sundaland; smaller animals were also able to disperse across the region.  Human migrations  According to the most widely accepted theory, the ancestors of the modern-day Austronesian populations of the Maritime Southeast Asia and adjacent regions are believed to have migrated southward, from the East Asia mainland to Taiwan, and then to the rest of Maritime Southeast Asia. An alternative theory points to the now-submerged Sundaland as the possible cradle of Asian population: thus the \\"Out of Sundaland\\" theory. However, this view is an extreme minority view among professional archaeologists, linguists, and geneticists. The Out of Taiwan model (though not necessarily the Express Train Out of Taiwan model) is accepted by the vast majority of professional researchers. A study from Leeds University and published in Molecular Biology and Evolution, examining mitochondrial DNA lineages, suggested that humans had been occupying the islands of Southeast Asia for a longer period than previously believed. Population dispersals seem to have occurred at the same time as sea levels rose, which may have resulted in migrations from the Philippine Islands to as far north as Taiwan within the last 10,000 years. The population migrations were most likely to have been driven by climate change — the effects of the drowning of an ancient continent. Rising sea levels in three massive pulses may have caused flooding and the submerging of the Sunda continent, creating the Java and South China Seas and the thousands of islands that make up Indonesia and the Philippines today. The changing sea levels would have caused these humans to move away from their coastal homes and culture, and farther inland throughout southeast Asia. This forced migration would have caused these humans to adapt to the new forest and mountainous environments, developing farms and domestication, and becoming the predecessors to future human populations in these regions. Genetic similarities were found between populations throughout Asia and an increase in genetic diversity from northern to southern latitudes. Although the Chinese population is very large, it has less variation than the smaller number of individuals living in Southeast Asia, because the Chinese expansion occurred very recently, within only the last 2,000 to 3,000 years. Oppenheimer locates the origin of the Austronesians in Sundaland and its upper regions. Genetic research reported in 2008 indicates that the islands which are the remnants of Sundaland were likely populated as early as 50,000 years ago, contrary to a previous hypothesis that they were populated as late as 10,000 years ago from Taiwan. From the standpoint of historical linguistics, the home of the Austronesian languages is the main island of Taiwan, also known by its unofficial Portuguese name of Formosa; on this island the deepest divisions in Austronesian are found, among the families of the native Formosan languages.

It is also the title of a 270-page book written by Kirkpatrick in 1982.Kirkpatrick, Jeane. (1982). Dictatorships and Double Standards: Rationalism and Reason in Politics. . The article in Commentary Magazine in 1979 is credited with leading directly to Kirkpatrick's becoming an adviser to Ronald Reagan and thus her appointment as United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Hence, the views expressed in Kirkpatrick's essay influenced the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, particularly with regard to Latin America. Kirkpatrick argued that by demanding rapid liberalization in traditionally autocratic countries, the Carter administration and previous administrations had delivered those countries to anti-American opposition groups that proved more repressive than the governments they overthrew. She further accused the administration of a \\"double standard\\" in that it had never applied its rhetoric on the necessity of liberalization to the affairs of Communist governments. The essay compares traditional autocracies and Communist regimes: Kirkpatrick concluded that while the United States should encourage liberalization and democracy in autocratic countries, it should not do so when the government is facing violent overthrow and should expect gradual change rather than immediate transformation.  Criticism  AFL–CIO's Tom Kahn criticized conceptual problems and strategic consequences in Kirkpatrick's analysis. In particular, Kahn suggested that policy should promote democracy even in the countries dominated by Soviet communism. Kahn argued that the Polish labor-union Solidarity deserved United States support and even in its first years demonstrated that civil society could expand and that free labor unions could be organized despite Communist regimes. Kirkpatrick's analysis of Communism underestimated the democratic potential of the working class. : Reprinted: Ted Galen Carpenter of the Cato Institute noted that while Communist movements tend to depose rival authoritarians, the traditional authoritarian regimes supported by the United States came to power by overthrowing democracies. Thus, he concludes that while Communist regimes are more difficult to eradicate, traditional autocratic regimes \\"pose the more lethal threat to functioning democracies\\".Ted Galen Carpenter (August 15, 1985). \\"The United States and Third World Dictatorships: A Case for Benign Detachment\\".

Lewis was well known for his contributions in the field of economic development. In 1979 he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He had dual Saint Lucian and British citizenships. Biography Arthur Lewis was born in Castries, Saint Lucia, then still part of the British Windward Islands federal colony, as the fourth of five children of George and Ida Lewis. His parents had migrated from Antigua shortly after the turn of the century. George Lewis died when Arthur turned seven, and Ida raised their five children alone. Arthur was a gifted student and was promoted two classes ahead of his age. After finishing school at the age of 14, Lewis worked as a clerk, while waiting to take his university entrance exam. During this time he became friends with Eric Williams, the future first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, and the two remained lifelong friends.Tignor, pp. 11–13. After graduating, Lewis’ initial career choice was to become an engineer. He made the eventual switch to economics because the governments and companies of British Colonies, such as St. Lucia, refused to hire blacks. At the age of 18, he would go on to earn a scholarship to attend the London School of Economics. Not only was this an opportunity for Lewis to study at perhaps the most prestigious University for Economics in the world, but he would also be the first black individual to ever gain acceptance at LSE. While enrolled, Lewis would achieve similar success here as he did in grade in school. Lewis’ academic superiority was noticed and admired by his peers and professors. While at LSE, Lewis had the opportunity to study under the likes of John Hicks, Arnold Plant, Lionel Robbins, and Friedrich Hayek. After gaining his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937 and a Ph.D. degree in 1940 at the London School of Economics (LSE) under supervision of Arnold Plant, Lewis worked as a member of the staff at the LSE until 1948. In 1947, he married Gladys Jacobs, and they had two daughters together. That year he was selected as a lecturer at the University of Manchester, and moved there with his family. He taught at Manchester until 1957. During this period, he developed some of his most important concepts about the patterns of capital and wages in developing countries. He particularly became known for his contributions to development economics, of great interest as former colonies began to gain independence from European nations. Lewis served as an economic advisor to numerous African and Caribbean governments, i.e. Nigeria, Ghana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Barbados. When Ghana gained independence in 1957, its government appointed Lewis as their first economic advisor. He helped draw up its first Five-Year Development Plan (1959–63).Felix Brenton, \\"Sir (William) Arthur Lewis (1915–1991)\\", Black Past website. In 1959 Lewis returned to the Caribbean region when appointed Vice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies. In 1963 he was knighted for his contributions to economics. That year, he was also appointed a University Professor at Princeton University and moved to the United States. Lewis worked at Princeton for the next two decades, teaching generations of students until his retirement in 1983. In 1970 Lewis also was selected as the first president of the Caribbean Development Bank, serving in that capacity until 1973.\\"Sir Wm. Arthur Lewis: President 1970 – 1973\\", Caribbean Development Bank. Lewis received the Nobel prize in Economics in 1979, sharing it with Theodore Schultz.\\"The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1979\\", Nobel in Economics, 1979. Accessed 5 January 2011. He died on 15 June 1991 in Bridgetown, Barbados. He was buried in the grounds of the St Lucian community college named in his honour. He was survived by his wife, Gladys Jacobs, Lady Lewis of Barbados and Princeton, NJ; two daughters, Elizabeth Lewis of Cranbury, NJ, and Barbara Virgil of Brooklyn; and four brothers: Stanley Lewis of Ghana, Earl Lewis of Trinidad, Allen Montgomery Lewis, a former Governor General of St Lucia, and Victor Lewis of St Lucia.

Key works The \\"Lewis model\\" Lewis published in 1954 what was to be his most influential development economics article, \\"Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour\\" (Manchester School). In this publication, he introduced what came to be called the dual sector model, or the \\"Lewis model\\". Lewis combined an analysis of the historical experience of developed countries with the central ideas of the classical economists to produce a broad picture of the development process. In his theory, a \\"capitalist\\" sector develops by taking labour from a non-capitalist backward \\"subsistence\\" sector. The subsistence sector is governed by informal institutions and social norms so that producers do not maximise profits and workers can be paid above their marginal product. At an early stage of development, the \\"unlimited\\" supply of labour from the subsistence economy means that the capitalist sector can expand for some time without the need to raise wages. This results in higher returns to capital, which are reinvested in capital accumulation. In turn, the increase in the capital stock leads the \\"capitalists\\" to expand employment by drawing further labour from the subsistence sector. Given the assumptions of the model (for example, that the profits are reinvested and that capital accumulation does not substitute for skilled labour in production), the process becomes self- sustaining and leads to modernization and economic development. The point at which the excess labour in the subsistence sector is fully absorbed into the modern sector, and where further capital accumulation begins to increase wages, is sometimes called the Lewisian turning point. It has recently been widely discussed in the context of economic development in China. The Theory of Economic Growth Lewis published The Theory of Economic Growth in 1955 in which he sought to “provide an appropriate framework for studying economic development,” driven by a combination of “curiosity and of practical need.” Influenced by 19th Century England or the Industrial Revolution. During the Industrial Revolution, England was experiencing the worst economic turmoil of its time. It wouldn't be until an economic enlightenment would take place cities began to shift towards factories and labor-intensive methods of production as they experienced giant shifts in the labor and agriculture markets. Thus, eventually leading to higher production, and higher income. Lewis theorized if England could turn its misfortune around, the same could be done for developing countries around the world. His theories would prove true for some countries such as Nigeria and Barbados as they would see some economic development See also * Black Nobel Prize laureates  References   Citations  Figueroa, M.

Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems is a collection of poems by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, first published in 1798 and generally considered to have marked the beginning of the English Romantic movement in literature.See via archive.org The immediate effect on critics was modest, but it became and remains a landmark, changing the course of English literature and poetry. Most of the poems in the 1798 edition were written by Wordsworth, with Coleridge contributing only four poems to the collection (although these made about a third of the book in length), including one of his most famous works, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. A second edition was published in 1800, in which Wordsworth included additional poems and a preface detailing the pair's avowed poetical principles.; via archive.org For another edition, published in 1802, Wordsworth added an appendix titled Poetic Diction in which he expanded the ideas set forth in the preface. via archive.org A third edition was published in 1802,3rd edition with substantial additions made to its \\"Preface,\\" and a fourth edition was published in 1805.4th edition Content Wordsworth and Coleridge set out to overturn what they considered the priggish, learned, and highly sculpted forms of 18th-century English poetry and to make poetry accessible to the average person via verse written in common, everyday language. These two major poets emphasize the vitality of the living voice used by the poor to express their reality. This language also helps assert the universality of human emotions. Even the title of the collection recalls rustic forms of art – the word \\"lyrical\\" links the poems with the ancient rustic bards and lends an air of spontaneity, while \\"ballads\\" are an oral mode of storytelling used by the common people. In the 'Advertisement' included in the 1798 edition, Wordsworth explained his poetical concept: > The majority of the following poems are to be considered as experiments. > They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language of > conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to the > purpose of poetic pleasure. If the experiment with vernacular language was not enough of a departure from the norm, the focus on simple, uneducated country people as the subject of poetry was a signal shift to modern literature. One of the main themes of \\"Lyrical Ballads\\" is the return to the original state of nature, in which people led a purer and more innocent existence. Wordsworth subscribed to Rousseau's belief that humanity was essentially good but was corrupted by the influence of society. This may be linked with the sentiments spreading through Europe just prior to the French Revolution. Poems in the second edition (1800) Poems marked \\"(Coleridge)\\" were written by Coleridge; all the other poems were written by Wordsworth. In the first edition (1798) there were nineteen poems written by Wordsworth and four poems by Coleridge.

They are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, PML, or PMNL) because of the varying shape of the nucleus, which is usually lobed into three segments. This distinguishes them from the mononuclear agranulocytes. The term polymorphonuclear leukocyte often refers specifically to \\"neutrophil granulocytes\\", the most abundant of the granulocytes; the other types (eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells) have lower numbers of lobes. Granulocytes are produced via granulopoiesis in the bone marrow. Types There are four types of granulocytes (full name polymorphonuclear granulocytes): * Basophils * Eosinophils * Neutrophils * Mast cells Except for the mast cells, their names are derived from their staining characteristics; for example, the most abundant granulocyte is the neutrophil granulocyte, which has neutrally staining cytoplasmic granules. Neutrophils A neutrophil with a segmented nucleus (center and surrounded by erythrocytes), the intra-cellular granules are visible in the cytoplasm (Giemsa-stained high magnification) Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, constituting 60% to 65% of the total circulating white blood cells, and consisting of two subpopulations: neutrophil-killers and neutrophil-cagers. One litre of human blood contains about five billion (5x109) neutrophils,Hoffbrand p. 331 which are about 12–15 micrometres in diameter.Abbas, Chapter 12, 5th Edition Once neutrophils have received the appropriate signals, it takes them about thirty minutes to leave the blood and reach the site of an infection.Sompayrac p. 18 Neutrophils do not return to the blood; they turn into pus cells and die. Mature neutrophils are smaller than monocytes, and have a segmented nucleus with several sections(two to five segments); each section is connected by chromatin filaments. Neutrophils do not normally exit the bone marrow until maturity, but during an infection neutrophil precursors called myelocytes and promyelocytes are released. Neutrophils have three strategies for directly attacking micro-organisms: phagocytosis (ingestion), release of soluble anti- microbials (including granule proteins), and generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophils are professional phagocytes:Robinson p. 187 and Ernst pp. 7–10 they are ferocious eaters and rapidly engulf invaders coated with antibodies and complement, as well as damaged cells or cellular debris. The intracellular granules of the human neutrophil have long been recognized for their protein-destroying and bactericidal properties.Paoletti p. 62 Neutrophils can secrete products that stimulate monocytes and macrophages; these secretions increase phagocytosis and the formation of reactive oxygen compounds involved in intracellular killing. Neutrophils have two types of granules; primary (azurophilic) granules (found in young cells) and secondary (specific) granules (which are found in more mature cells). Primary granules contain cationic proteins and defensins that are used to kill bacteria, proteolytic enzymes and cathepsin G to break down (bacterial) proteins, lysozyme to break down bacterial cell walls, and myeloperoxidase (used to generate toxic bacteria-killing substances). In addition, secretions from the primary granules of neutrophils stimulate the phagocytosis of IgG antibody-coated bacteria. The secondary granules contain compounds that are involved in the formation of toxic oxygen compounds, lysozyme, and lactoferrin (used to take essential iron from bacteria). Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) comprise a web of fibers composed of chromatin and serine proteases that trap and kill microbes extracellularly. Trapping of bacteria is a particularly important role for NETs in sepsis, where NET are formed within blood vessels. Eosinophils Eosinophils also have kidney-shaped lobed nuclei (two to four lobes). The number of granules in an eosinophil can vary because they have a tendency to degranulate while in the blood stream. Eosinophils play a crucial part in the killing of parasites (e.g., enteric nematodes) because their granules contain a unique, toxic basic protein and cationic protein (e.g., cathepsin); receptors that bind to IgE are used to help with this task. These cells also have a limited ability to participate in phagocytosis,Campbell p. 903 they are professional antigen- presenting cells, they regulate other immune cell functions (e.g., CD4+ T cell, dendritic cell, B cell, mast cell, neutrophil, and basophil functions), they are involved in the destruction of tumor cells, and they promote the repair of damaged tissue. A polypeptide called interleukin-5 interacts with eosinophils and causes them to grow and differentiate; this polypeptide is produced by basophils and by T-helper 2 cells (TH2).  Basophils  A basophil with lobed nuclei surrounded by erythrocytes Basophils are one of the least abundant cells in bone marrow and blood (occurring at less than two percent of all cells). Like neutrophils and eosinophils, they have lobed nuclei; however, they have only two lobes, and the chromatin filaments that connect them are not very visible. Basophils have receptors that can bind to IgE, IgG, complement, and histamine. The cytoplasm of basophils contains a varied amount of granules; these granules are usually numerous enough to partially conceal the nucleus. Granule contents of basophils are abundant with histamine, heparin, chondroitin sulfate, peroxidase, platelet-activating factor, and other substances. When an infection occurs, mature basophils will be released from the bone marrow and travel to the site of infection. When basophils are injured, they will release histamine, which contributes to the inflammatory response that helps fight invading organisms. Histamine causes dilation and increased permeability of capillaries close to the basophil. Injured basophils and other leukocytes will release another substance called prostaglandins that contributes to an increased blood flow to the site of infection. Both of these mechanisms allow blood-clotting elements to be delivered to the infected area (this begins the recovery process and blocks the travel of microbes to other parts of the body). Increased permeability of the inflamed tissue also allows for more phagocyte migration to the site of infection so that they can consume microbes. Mast cells Mast cells are a type of granulocyte that are present in tissues; they mediate host defense against pathogens (e.g., parasites) and allergic reactions, particularly anaphylaxis. Mast cells are also involved in mediating inflammation and autoimmunity as well as mediating and regulating neuroimmune system responses. Development Granulocytes are derived from stem cells residing in the bone marrow. The differentiation of these stem cells from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell into granulocytes is termed granulopoiesis. Multiple intermediate cell types exist in this differentiation process, including myeloblasts and promyelocytes.  Function  Granule contents Examples of toxic materials produced or released by degranulation by granulocytes on the ingestion of microorganisms are: * Antimicrobial agents (Defensins and Eosinophil cationic protein) * Enzymes  Acid hydrolases: further digest bacteria  Lysozyme: dissolves cell walls of some gram-positive bacteria * Low pH vesicles (3.5-4.0) * Toxic nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide) * Toxic oxygen-derived products (e.g., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxy radicals, singlet oxygen, hypohalite) Clinical significance Granulocytopenia is an abnormally low concentration of granulocytes in the blood. This condition reduces the body's resistance to many infections. Closely related terms include agranulocytosis (etymologically, \\"no granulocytes at all\\"; clinically, granulocyte levels less than 5% of normal) and neutropenia (deficiency of neutrophil granulocytes). Granulocytes live only one to two days in circulation (four days in spleen or other tissue), so transfusion of granulocytes as a therapeutic strategy would confer a very short-lasting benefit. In addition, there are many complications associated with such a procedure. There is usually a granulocyte chemotactic defect in individuals suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus. Research suggests giving granulocyte transfusions to prevent infections decreased the number of people who had a bacterial or fungal infection in the blood. Further research suggests participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions show no difference in clinical reversal of concurrent infection.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2014. He was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. Background Klees was born in Landau, West Germany. His parents were Danube Swabians, German pioneers whose ancestors settled in parts of eastern Europe that would later be known as Hungary and Yugoslavia. At the age of five, Klees came with his family to Canada and settled in Leamington, Ontario. He worked as a businessman in the financial services sector with Canada Life Assurance. He then became an entrepreneur, and started a sports agency which represented professional athletes. Klees also co-founded the Municipal Gas Corporation in 1990, and served as its executive vice-president until 1997. Klees sat on the board of the controversial Universal Energy Corporation, a natural gas and electricity retailer which has been fined by the Ontario Energy Board on several occasions and frequently criticised by its own customers as being a scam. When Universal was bought out by Just Energy he was presented a seat on the board of their Exchange corporation.http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/board.asp?privcapId=30823371 From 1992 to 1994, he was third vice-president and policy chair of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. Klees lives in Aurora, Ontario. Politics Klees ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1975 provincial election, losing to Liberal Remo Mancini in the southwestern riding of Essex South. He lost to Mancini a second time in the 1977 election. Klees was elected to the legislature in the election of 1995, defeating former Liberal leadership candidate Charles Beer in York—Mackenzie. He was easily re-elected in the 1999 provincial election running in the new riding of Oak Ridges. On June 17, 1999 he was appointed to the cabinet of Premier Mike Harris as Chief Government Whip, Deputy House Leader and Minister without Portfolio. In 2000, Klees was preparing to run as a candidate for the leadership of the new Canadian Alliance, but withdrew because one of his key financial backers insisted on a last-minute deal to make a significant funding commitment conditional on Klees throwing his support to one of the other candidates on the second ballot. Klees stepped down from his ministerial position on July 30, 2001 for what he described as personal reasons. After returning to the backbenches for a year, he was reappointed to cabinet on October 3, 2002 as Minister of Tourism under Harris' successor, Ernie Eves. On February 25, 2003, he became Minister of Transportation, and served in that position until the defeat of the Eves government in the October 2003 election. Klees was re- elected in 2003, and was a candidate in the 2004 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election which took place on September 18, 2004. He was endorsed by Tory MPPs Jerry Ouellette, Ted Chudleigh and Bill Murdoch, and groups such as the Conservative Youth Coalition. The other candidates in the race were Whitby-Ajax MPP Jim Flaherty and former Rogers Communications CEO John Tory. Klees made healthcare his biggest priority in the campaign. He was the only candidate to openly endorse a semi-privatized health care system. Other key issues of his campaign were school choice, physical education in the school system, OHIP statements, and foreign-trained doctors applying for employment. Klees was eliminated from the contest after placing third on the first ballot; Tory subsequently won on the second ballot. Klees increased his profile during the campaign, and became the Critic for Education and Citizenship & Immigration in the Legislature as well as a member of the Justice Committee. Klees was elected in the newly created provincial riding of Newmarket-Aurora in the 2007 Ontario general election. He was re-elected in the 2011 Ontario election. Klees contested the 2009 leadership race, placing second behind the winner, Tim Hudak. The single biggest campaign contribution of $32,000 was made by OPTUS Capital Corporation, owned by Universal Energy Corporation's founder and CEO Mark Silver. It accounted for 20% of the total contributions. Klees made a \\"surprisingly impolitic concession speech\\", and it was reported that he had a cool relationship with Hudak, in part because Klees supported Tory as party leader while Hudak refused. After the 2011 general election Klees requested the post of deputy party leader, presently held by Whitby-Oshawa MPP Christine Elliott, but Tim Hudak instead offered the shadow cabinet role of transportation critic along with ethnic outreach in the PC party's shadow cabinet, which Klees turned down. On October 25, 2011, Klees announced that he would run for Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, in defiance of the opposition party leaders who had earlier ordered their members not to contest the Speakership. The minority Liberal government was one seat short of forming a majority and if Klees had been elected Speaker, he would have given the government a working majority as the speaker usually votes with the government in motions of non-confidence. The move was met with derision from other Conservatives with one MPP saying, \\"This is the equivalent of crossing the floor... The Liberals better support him, because Frank doesn’t have a lot of friends in our caucus today.\\" Klees withdrew his candidacy on October 29, 2011 due to lack of support. He did not run in the 2014 election.

He is best known for having served as the first public editor of The New York Times newspaper, inventing Rotisserie League Baseball, and for writing several books (such as Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition, which served as a major source for the 2011 Ken Burns/Lynn Novick miniseries Prohibition). In November 2011, Last Call won the Albert J. Beveridge prize, awarded by the American Historical Association to the year's best book of American history. His most recent book, published May 2019, is The Guarded Gate: Bigotry, Eugenics, and the Law That Kept Two Generations of Jews, Italians, and Other European Immigrants Out of America. Early life and education Born to a Jewish family in Detroit, Michigan, Okrent graduated from Cass Technical High School in Detroit in 1965 and from the University of Michigan, where he worked on the university's student newspaper The Michigan Daily. Career Most of his career has been spent as an editor, at such places as Alfred A. Knopf; Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich; Esquire Magazine; New England Monthly; Life Magazine; and Time, Inc. His book Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center (Viking, 2003) was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for History. In October 2003, Okrent was named public editor for The New York Times following the Jayson Blair scandal. He held this position until May 2005. Okrent and Peter Gethers, having acquired the theatrical rights to the site and name of the web series Old Jews Telling Jokes, co-wrote and co-produced a revue of that name. It opened at the Westside Theatre in Manhattan on May 20, 2012. On May 3, 2014, the University of Michigan awarded Okrent an honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters. Since 2017, Okrent has been listed on the Advisory Board of the Secular Coalition for America.  Okrent's law  He formulated what has become known as \\"Okrent's law\\" in an interview comment he made about his new job. It states: \\"The pursuit of balance can create imbalance because sometimes something is true\\", referring to the phenomenon of the press providing legitimacy to unsupported fringe viewpoints in an effort to appear even-handed. Baseball Okrent invented Rotisserie League Baseball, the best-known form of fantasy baseball, in 1979. The name comes from the fact that he proposed the idea to his friends while dining at La Rôtisserie Française restaurant in New York City. Okrent's team in the Rotisserie League was called the \\"Okrent Fenokees\\", a pun on the Okefenokee Swamp. He was one of the first two people inducted into the Fantasy Sports Hall of Fame. Okrent was still playing Rotisserie as of 2009 under the team name Dan Druffs. Despite having been credited with inventing fantasy baseball he has never been able to win a Rotisserie League. His exploits of inventing Rotisserie League Baseball were chronicled in Silly Little Game, part of the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary series, in 2010. Okrent is also credited with inventing the baseball stat, WHIP. At the time he referred to it as IPRAT, signifying \\"Innings Pitched Ratio\\". In May 1981, Okrent wrote and Sports Illustrated published \\"He Does It by the Numbers\\". This profile of the then-unknown Bill James launched James's career as baseball's foremost analyst. In 1994, Okrent was filmed for his in- depth knowledge of baseball history for the Ken Burns documentary Baseball. During the nine-part series, a red-sweater-wearing Okrent delivered a detailed analysis of the cultural aspects of the national pastime, including a comparison of the dramatic Game 6 of the 1975 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds to the conflict and character development in Russian novels. The death of print In the late 1990s, as editor of new media at Time Inc., Okrent wrote about the future of magazine publishing. He believed that the advancement of digital technologies would make it easier for people to read newspapers, magazines and books online. In late 1999, Okrent made a prediction about the future of print media in the Hearst New Media Lecture at the Graduate School of Journalism of Columbia University. He told his audience: Personal life Okrent has participated in LearnedLeague under the name \\"OkrentD\\".

A member of the so-called traitorous eight, he left Nobel-winning physicist William Shockley's company to form Fairchild Semiconductor.  Early life and education  Blank was born and raised in Manhattan's Lower East Side, the youngest of three children of Jewish immigrants Charles and Gussie Blank. His father made musical-instrument cases and luggage, and also worked as a Russian translator. Julius Blank attended Erasmus Hall High School, graduating at 15. He began taking classes at City College of New York while working at various jobs. His first job, in a factory, motivated him to learn more, and he attended a trade school as well. When he turned 18, he was drafted to serve in the U.S. Army in World War II. He reported for active duty on July 5, 1943. After basic infantry training, he was placed in the Army Specialized Training Program. In April 1944, he was sent overseas, where he was injured in December 1944 during the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. He was subsequently transferred to the Air Corps to serve as a machinist for airplane parts to overhaul radial engines. He held a variety of positions during the war, gaining considerable experience in the practicalities of general engineering. In 1946 he returned home, where he completed his Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the City College of New York, financed by the G.I. Bill.  Career  Blank worked as an engineer at Babcock & Wilcox in Barberton, Ohio from 1950 to 1951, making large steam boilers for the power industry. He then moved to Goodyear Aircraft, where he worked from 1951 to 1952 on a wide variety of research and design projects including aircraft propulsion, air ship fabrics, parachutes, and submarines. Because his wife Ethel wanted to move back to New York, they returned there in 1952. After their return, Blank found a job in manufacturing engineering at Western Electric in Kearny, New Jersey where he worked from 1952 to 1956. At Western Electric he worked on No. 4 toll crossbar switching equipment, used in the first dialing systems for connecting calls automatically without a human long-distance operator. One of the pieces of equipment involved was a card translator with an array of germanium photo transistors that routed calls in the switching system. Blank also worked as a troubleshooter for a plating room, where he gained practical experience in metal finishing and the use of acids and chemicals.  Shockley Semiconductor Two of the people Blank worked with at Western Electric were Dean Knapic and Eugene Kleiner. Knapic was approached by William Shockley to form an engineering group at the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments, in California. Knapic recommended Blank and Kleiner, who were interviewed by Shockley in a restaurant at Newark Airport, between flights. In April 1956, Blank joined Shockley Semiconductor, followed a couple of months later by Kleiner. Blank was a Senior Staff Engineer from 1956 to 1957. The Blanks lived initially in Palo Alto, California, moving to Los Altos Hills, California in 1966. One of Blank's first assignments at Shockley was to build a crystal grower. Shockley had a number of ideas about how to build a crystal grower so as to eliminate contamination from oxygen in the quartz, but the resulting equipment was elaborate and had several problems. Blank eventually built a conventional crystal grower based on the Czochralski process instead. Diffusion furnaces also had to be built, because existing laboratory furnaces did not meet the requirements of semiconductor production. They were too small, not well enough controlled, and not capable of being used for long periods of time. Vacuum evaporators for evaporating metals also needed to be more robust and readily controlled. Blank worked at Shockley Semiconductor until he and others, later dubbed the \\"traitorous eight\\", left to form the influential Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation. Blank indicated that he personally had not had problems with Shockley, but that Shockley's treatment of others was disturbing. Management difficulties accelerated after Shockley won the Nobel Prize:  Fairchild Semiconductor  In August 1957 Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce and Sheldon Roberts reached an agreement with Sherman Fairchild of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. On September 18, 1957 they formed Fairchild Semiconductor. Julius Blank found the company's first home, a 14,000 square foot building at 844 Charleston Road, between Palo Alto and Mountain View. Little more than a shell, it lacked both plumbing and electricity. Kleiner and Blank were in charge of transforming the empty building into usable spaces for production, research and offices. In addition to mundane requirements like sewer and water, the work spaces required extra electrical power, air conditioning to afford some level of climate control during processing, and piping and venting of gases. Blank's experience during the war and at Western Electric was helpful in dealing with these physical requirements. As they were readying the building itself, the founders were also ordering desks, lab benches and scientific equipment, and starting to build specialized equipment that they couldn't order: crystal growers, diffusion furnaces, vacuum evaporators, and optical lithography equipment for mask-making. Everyone worked toward the goal of getting the business underway. The group's initial research had led to a breakthrough, the design of the silicon computer chip. Much of the responsibility for learning how to mass- produce silicon chips, and building the machinery needed to do it, fell to Julius Blank and Eugene Kleiner as the only engineers in the group. At Fairchild, they were responsible for setting up the initial machine shop and assembly areas. What they were doing was fundamentally new: no one built the equipment that they needed. Blank and Kleiner were in charge of designing \\"the first assembly line for the basic building blocks of the electronic world\\", silicon chips, \\"from the ground up\\". \\"A brilliant mechanical engineer\\", Blank designed everything from furnaces and crystal growers to optical alignment and assembly equipment. Later on, as the semiconductor industry developed, it became easier to order equipment and materials. However, there continued to be an ongoing tension, trying to find robust equipment that could produce at high capacity. As the company expanded, Blank's role changed. He became responsible for establishing manufacturing facilities for the company in Hong Kong and other countries. Blank was aware of the challenges of starting up a business in another country, both socially and physically. Fairchild Semiconductor became a leader of the semiconductor industry. At Fairchild, Blank was part of the team that established a \\"model for entrepreneurs for the rest of [the 20th] century\\": stock options, no job titles and open working relationships. The incubator of Silicon Valley, Fairchild was directly or indirectly involved in the creation of dozens of corporations such as AMD and Intel.  Consultancy  In 1969, Blank decided to leave Fairchild and become a consultant to new startup companies. He was the last of the original eight founding members to leave Fairchild. In 1978, Blank co-founded Xicor, where he was a member of its Board of Directors. The company's NOVRAM computer chip, a type of non-volatile memory, was designed so that systems could retain and save data in the event of power failure. In 2004, Xicor was acquired by Intersil Corp. for approximately US$529 million.  Awards  In May, 2011, the California Historical Society in San Francisco gave the Legends of California Award to Blank, 85, and other founders of Fairchild Semiconductor.\\"Legends of California\\", California Historical Society 2011 announcement. Retrieved 2011-05-18.  Later life  In 2011, Blank lived in a retirement center across the street from the old Fairchild headquarters at 844 Charleston Road in Palo Alto, where he used to have his office. The site is now a California Historical Landmark. Blank died on September 17, 2011 in Los Altos Hills, California. His wife, Ethel, an art curator, had died previously in 2008 after nearly 60 years of marriage. He was survived by two sons, Jeffrey and David, and two grandsons.

The ancient and mysterious city is barely described and is viewed only in hindsight (after its destruction) by a character who once lived there. Its name may be derived from the medieval city of Carcassonne in southern France, whose Latin name was \\"Carcaso.\\" American writer Robert W. Chambers borrowed the name \\"Carcosa\\" for his stories, inspiring generations of authors to similarly use Carcosa in their own works. The King in Yellow The city was later used more extensively in Robert W. Chambers' book of short horror stories published in 1895, titled The King in Yellow. Chambers had read Bierce's work and borrowed a few additional names from his work, including Hali and Hastur. In Chambers' stories, and within the apocryphal play titled The King in Yellow, which is mentioned several times within them, the city of Carcosa is a mysterious, ancient, and possibly cursed place. The most precise description of its location is the shores of Lake Hali, in the star cluster Hyades, either on another planet, or in another universe. For instance: :Along the shore the cloud waves break, :The twin suns sink behind the lake, :The shadows lengthen ::In Carcosa. : :Strange is the night where black stars rise, :And strange moons circle through the skies, :But stranger still is ::Lost Carcosa. : :Songs that the Hyades shall sing, :Where flap the tatters of the King, :Must die unheard in ::Dim Carcosa. : :Song of my soul, my voice is dead, :Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed :Shall dry and die in ::Lost Carcosa. : :—\\"Cassilda's Song\\" in The King in Yellow Act 1, Scene 2 Associated names Lake Hali is a misty lake found near the city of Hastur. In the fictional play The King in Yellow (obliquely described by author Robert W. Chambers in the collection of short stories of the same title), the mysterious cities of Alar\\"Yhtill\\" is the name of the city where The King in Yellow is set. In post-Chambers writings, the word means \\"stranger\\" in the language of Alar (a city in the play) and is the name used by the character wearing the \\"Pallid Mask.\\" (Harms, \\"Yhtill,\\" The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana, p. 341; cf. \\"The Repairer of Reputations,\\" Chambers.) and Carcosa stand beside the lake. As with Carcosa, it is referenced in the Cthulhu Mythos stories of H.P. Lovecraft and the authors who followed him. The name Hali originated in Ambrose Bierce's \\"An Inhabitant of Carcosa\\" (1886) in which Hali is the author of a quote which prefaces the story. The narrator of the story implies that the person named Hali is now dead (at least in the timeline of the story). Several other nearly undescribed places are alluded to in Chambers' writing, among them Hastur, Yhtill, and Aldebaran. \\"Aldebaran\\" may refer to the star Aldebaran, likely as it is also associated with the mention of the Hyades star cluster, with which it shares space in the night sky. The Yellow Sign, described as a symbol, not of any human script, is supposed to originate from the same place as Carcosa. One other name associated is \\"Demhe\\" and its \\"cloudy depths\\" − this has never been explained either by Chambers or any famous pastiche-writer and so we do not know what or who exactly \\"Demhe\\" is. Marion Zimmer Bradley (and Diana L. Paxson since Bradley's death) also used these names in her Darkover series. Other appearances Written references Later writers, including H. P. Lovecraft and his many admirers, became great fans of Chambers' work and incorporated the name of Carcosa into their own stories, set in the Cthulhu Mythos. The King in Yellow and Carcosa have inspired many modern authors, including Karl Edward Wagner (\\"The River of Night's Dreaming\\"), Joseph S. Pulver (\\"Carl Lee & Cassilda\\"), Lin Carter, James Blish, Michael Cisco (\\"He Will Be There\\"), Ann K. Schwader, Robert M. Price, Galad Elflandsson, Simon Strantzas (\\"Beyond the Banks of the River Seine\\"), Charles Stross (in the Laundry Files series), Anders Fager and S. M. Stirling (in the Emberverse series). Joseph S. Pulver has written nearly 30 tales and poems that are based on and/or include Carcosa, The King in Yellow, or other elements from Robert W. Chambers. Pulver also edited an anthology A Season in Carcosa of new tales based upon The King in Yellow, released by Miskatonic River Press in 2012.Joseph S. Pulver Sr., A Season in Carcosa , Miskatonic River Press, 2012 (accessed 27 June 2014). John Scott Tynes contributed to the mythology of Chambers' Carcosa in a series of novellas, \\"Broadalbin,\\" \\"Ambrose,\\" and \\"Sosostris,\\" and essays in issue 1 of The Unspeakable Oath and in Delta Green. In Paul Edwin Zimmer's Dark Border series, Carcosa is a city where humans mingle with their nearly-immortal allies, the Hastur. In Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson's The Illuminatus! Trilogy, Carcosa is connected with an ancient civilization in the Gobi Desert, destroyed when the Illuminati arrived on Earth via flying saucers from the planet Vulcan. In maps of the world of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, a city named Carcosa is labeled on the easternmost edge of the map along the coast of a large lake, near other magical cities such as Asshai. In The World of Ice and Fire, it is mentioned that a sorcerer lord lives there who claims to be the sixty-ninth Yellow Emperor, from a dynasty fallen for a thousand years.George R.R. Martin, Elio M. García Jr., Linda Antonsson, The World of Ice and Fire, Bantam, 2014. In the short story \\"Dinner in Carcosa,\\" Western Canadian author Allan Williams re-imagines Carcosa as an abandoned Alberta prairie town with still-active insurance policies held by an ominous firm called \\"Hastur & Associates.\\" The story revolves around a chance encounter between a young insurance adjuster and the Ambrosovich family. In the satirical novel Kamus of Kadizhar: The Black Hole of Carcosa by John Shirley (St. Martin's Press, 1988), Carcosa is the name of a planet whose weird black hole physics figures in the story. Swedish writer Anders Fager's \\"Miss Witt's Great Work of Art\\" features a Stockholm-based coterie known as \\"The Carcosa Foundation\\" that worships Hastur. In David Drake's Lord of the Isles series, Carcosa is the name of the ancient capital of the old kingdom, which collapsed a thousand years before the events of the series. In S.M. Stirling's Emberverse series, Carcosa is the name of a South Pacific city inhabited by evil people led by the Yellow Raja and the Pallid Mask. In Lawrence Watt-Evans's The Lords of Dûs series, a character known as the Forgotten King, who dresses in yellow rags, reveals that he was exiled from Carcosa. In writer Alan Moore's Neonomicon, drawn by artist Jacen Burrowes, the character Johnny Carcosa is the key to a mystical Lovecraftian universe. Television In the HBO original series True Detective, 'Carcosa' is presented as a man-made temple. Located in the back woods of Louisiana, the temple serves as a place of ritualistic sexual abuse of children and child murder organized by a group of wealthy Louisiana politicians and church leaders. The main characters, Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, storm the temple in the final episode of the season, where they confront a serial killer, who is the most active member of the cult. It is understood that the cult worships the \\"Yellow King\\", to whom an effigy is dedicated in the main chamber of 'Carcosa'. The series hints at a larger conspiracy which continues beyond the show, which is in line with Lovecraftian horror, as is a vision experienced by one character that underscores Lovecraftian themes like cosmic indifference. \\"Oh, The Sin Of Writing Such Words: The Infinite Horror Labyrinth Of The Carcosa Mythos\\", Shudder Magazine, by Derek Fisher, August 25, 2020 In Part 3 of the Netflix original series The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, the barker of the traveling amusement park and carnival is named Carcosa, and the carnival in turn named, presumably, after him. Throughout the season of the show, it becomes apparent that the workers at the carnival are all mythological beings of old, with Carcosa himself being the god Pan, his true form being that of a satyr, in the show understood to be the god of madness. The arc of the season revolves partially around the attempts of the carnival workers to resurrect an older deity identified as The Green Man. Themes of madness, death and resurrection parallel the works of Robert W. Chambers et al..  Other References  In the 1988 album \\"Passage to Arcturo\\" by Rotting Christ, the song \\"Inside The Eye of Algond\\" nominates the Mystical Carcosa as part of the singer's journey. The second song of the 2015 album Luminiferous by the American metal band High on Fire is named Carcosa. In 2016 DigiTech released a Fuzz pedal called the Carcosa. The pedal featured two modes, named \\"Hali\\" and \\"Demhe.\\" Maria, a film by King Abalos, takes place in a mysterious mountain called Carcosa. In the Mass Effect 3 universe there is a planet named Carcosa. In 2001 the Belgian black metal band Ancient Rites released the album Dim Carcosa. The title track's lyrics consist of excerpts from \\"Cassilda's Song\\". In the early 2000s, a Mysterious Package Company experience called The King in Yellow was introduced, heavily inspired by story and title. Later, a sequel experience entitled Carcosa: Rise of the Cult was created, obviously connected to this shared universe, and connected to the original The King in Yellow. The 2019 EP \\"On the Shores of Hali\\" by Cassilda and Carcosa makes numerous references to Chamber's version of Carcosa. Publishers using the name Carcosa Two different publishers have used the name Carcosa. Carcosa House Carcosa House was a science fiction specialty publishing firm formed in 1947 by Frederick B. Shroyer, a boyhood friend of T. E. Dikty, and two Los Angeles science fiction fans, Russell Hodgkins and Paul Skeeters. Shroyer had secured a copy of the original newspaper appearance of the novel Edison's Conquest of Mars by Garrett P. Serviss which he wished to publish. Shroyer talked Hodgkins and Skeeters into going in on shares to form the publisher which issued the Serviss book in 1947. Dikty offered advice, and William L. Crawford of F.P.C.I. helped with production and distribution. Carcosa House announced one other book, Enter Ghost: A Study in Weird Fiction, by Sam Russell, but due to slow sales of the Serviss book, it was never published. Works published by Carcosa House * Edison's Conquest of Mars, by Garrett P. Serviss (1947) Carcosa Colophon for the Carcosa publishing company Carcosa was a specialty publishing firm formed by David Drake, Karl Edward Wagner, and Jim Groce, who were concerned that Arkham House would cease publication after the death of its founder, August Derleth. Carcosa was founded in North Carolina in 1973 and put out four collections of pulp horror stories, all edited by Wagner. Their first book was a huge omnibus volume of the best non-series weird fiction by Manly Wade Wellman. It was enhanced by a group of chilling illustrations by noted fantasy artists Lee Brown Coye. Their other three volumes were also giant omnibus collections (of work by Hugh B. Cave, E. Hoffman Price, and again by Manly Wade Wellman). A fifth collection was planned, Death Stalks the Night, by Hugh B. Cave; Lee Brown Coye was working on illustrating it when he suffered a crippling stroke in 1977 and eventually died, causing Carcosa to abandon the project. The book was eventually published by Fedogan & Bremer. Carcosa also had plans to issue volumes by Leigh Brackett, H. Warner Munn and Jack Williamson; however, none of the projected volumes appeared. The Carcosa colophon depicts the silhouette of a towered city in front of three moons.

In the Quebec-based geopolitical/live action role play game Bicolline, Carcosa is a kingdom in the west. It was established upon principles of freedom and is populated by pirates, gypsies, escaped slaves, and religious exiles. Carcosa is borrowed by George R. R.

Brawling giants Many consider the Sabri Brothers instrumentally more adventurous, than Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Aziz Mian mastered in presenting intoxication as closeness to God, and said more than 3,000 couplets in that metaphor, and even Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was a perfectionist in discussing the beauty of the Creator of feminine attractiveness. although The Sabri Brothers even though recited many famous couplets and poetries in presenting intoxication and closeness to God as a part of Sufi culture. They mostly focused on Hamd (Praise of God), Naat (Praising of the Holy Prophet), and Manqabat (Praising of Holy People And Saints). During the 1970s a squabble started between the two greatest Sufi singers when Sabri Brothers released one of their biggest hits Bhar do Jholi Meri, while Aziz Mian released his biggest hit Main Sharaabi. The rivalry became more aggressive when The Sabri Brothers released a thinly veiled taunt at Aziz Mian in shape of a Qawwali titled O sharabi, chord de peena (O drunkard, stop drinking). This qawwali became an immediate super hit, sung in the typically steady, controlled and hypnotic style. Aziz Mian was quick to strike back. He composed and recorded Haaye kambakht Tu Ne Pi Hi Nahi (O Unfortunate, you never drank!) on the third day of the release of Oh Sharabi Chord De Peena, And even Aziz Mian's reply was a quick super hit . In his reply he disparaged the Brothers. Aziz Mian lamented that the Brothers were too conventional and that their spiritual connection with the Almighty was not as stark as his. When Aziz Mian criticized the Sabri Brothers regarding their knowledge of Sufism and love of god, they retaliated and replied with their super hit Saqia Aur Pila which was directly focused on their intoxicated love for God and based on their knowledge of Sufism. EMI-Pakistan, which released both the records, together claimed that Aziz Mian and Sabri Brothers, sold over two million LPs and cassettes from this brawl. Even though The Sabri Brothers and Aziz Mian had a professional competition, they maintained good friendly relations with each other.

It is narrated from the time of the Napoleonic Wars, and depicts events several decades earlier,Count Jan Potocki: The Saragossa Manuscript. Book review by Anthony Campbell (2001). Retrieved September 22, 2011.The Mystical Count Potocki. Fortean Times. Retrieved September 22, 2011. during the reign of King Philip V (r. 1700–46).Potocki, Jan (1966) The Saragossa Manuscript; transl. from French by Elizabeth Abbott. London: Icon Books; p. 9 The novel was adapted into a 1965 Polish-language film, The Saragossa Manuscript (), by director Wojciech Has, with Zbigniew Cybulski as Alfonse van Worden.  Plot summary  The Manuscript Found in Saragossa collects intertwining stories, all of them set in whole or in part in Spain, with a large and colorful cast of Romani, thieves, inquisitors, a cabbalist, a geometer, the cabbalist's beautiful sister, two Moorish princesses (Emina and Zubeida) and others that the brave, perhaps foolhardy, Walloon Guard Alphonse van Worden meets, imagines or reads about in the Sierra Morena mountains of 18th-century Spain while en route to Madrid. Recounted to the narrator over the course of sixty- six days, the novel's stories quickly overshadow van Worden's frame story. The bulk of the stories revolve around the Gypsy chief Avadoro, whose story becomes a frame story itself. Eventually the narrative focus moves again toward van Worden's frame story and a conspiracy involving an underground — or perhaps entirely hallucinated — Muslim society, revealing the connections and correspondences between the hundred or so stories told over the novel's sixty- six days. The stories cover a wide range of genres and subjects, including the gothic, the picaresque, the erotic, the historical, the moral and the philosophic; and as a whole, the novel reflects Potocki's far-ranging interests, especially his deep fascination with secret societies, the supernatural and \\"Oriental\\" cultures. The novel's stories-within-stories sometimes reach several levels of depth, and characters and themes — a few prominent themes being honor, disguise, metamorphosis and conspiracy — recur and change shape throughout. Because of its rich and varied interlocking structure, the novel echoes favorable comparison to many celebrated literary antecedents such as the ancient BCE Jatakas and Panchatantra as well as the medieval Arabian Nights and Decameron.  Textual history  The first \\"days\\" of The Manuscript Found in Saragossa were initially published apart from the rest of the novel in 1805, while the stories comprising the Gypsy chief's tale were added later. The novel was written incrementally and was left in its final form—though never exactly completed—at the time of the author's suicide in 1815. Potocki composed the book entirely in French. Sections of the original French-language manuscripts were later lost, but have been back- translated into French from a Polish translation that had been made in 1847 by Edmund Chojecki from a complete French-language copy, now lost. The first integral French-language version of the work, based on several French-language manuscripts and on Chojecki's 1847 Polish translation, was edited by René Radrizzani and published in 1989 by the renowned French publishing house of José Corti. Translations of the novel from the French rely, for the missing sections, on Chojecki's Polish translation. The most recent English-language edition, published by Penguin Books in 1995, was translated by Ian Maclean. The most recent and complete French-language version to date was edited by François Rosset and Dominique Triaire and published in 2006 in Leuven, Belgium, as part of a critical scholarly edition of the Complete Works of Potocki. Unlike Radrizzani's 1989 edition of the Manuscript Found in Saragossa, Rosset and Triaire's edition is based solely on Potocki's French- language manuscripts found in libraries in France, Poland (in particular, previously unknown autograph pieces that they discovered in Poznań), Spain and Russia, as well as in the private collection of Potocki's heirs. Rosset and Triaire identified two versions of the novel: one unfinished, of 1804, published in 1805; and the full version of 1810, which appears to have been completely reconceived in comparison to the 1804 version. Whereas the first version has a lighter, more sceptical tone, the second one tends toward a darker, more religious mood. In view of the differences between the two versions, the 1804 and 1810 versions have been published as two separate books; paperback editions were issued in early 2008 by Flammarion.  Film, TV, theatre  In 1965, director Wojciech Has adapted the novel into a Polish- language black-and-white film The Saragossa Manuscript (Polish title: Rękopis znaleziony w Saragossie), starring Zbigniew Cybulski. The film was released in a full-length Polish version (180 minutes) and in shortened versions in other countries (152 minutes in the United States, and 125 in the United Kingdom). The film was admired by many 1960s counterculture figures, notably Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia, who financed a complete print, as well as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Luis Buñuel. Neil Gaiman has referenced the book and film, in passing, in at least three different works. The film was shot near Częstochowa and in Wrocław, Poland. A detailed outline of the movie's plot is available online. In 1973, the novel was adapted into a television mini-series in France, under the title \\"La Duchesse d'Avila\\", with Jean Blaise as Van Worden. The late Vi Marriott adapted the book for The Cherub Theatre Company, which was performed by them under the title 'Ten Days A-Maze' and won several awards at the 1997 Edinburgh Fringe.* A later adaption is the Romanian-language play Saragosa, 66 de Zile (Saragossa, 66 Days), written and directed by Alexandru Dabija in 1999 at the Odeon Theatre Bucharest, and first represented at The Theater der Welt Festival in Berlin. Christine Mary Dunford adapted an English-language stage version from Ian Maclean's translation of the novel. Manuscript found in Saragossa. ChicagoCritic.com Internet Archive. Subsequently, the novel (and film) acted themselves as a frame-story for an episode of the Italian TV series Inspector Montalbano. In 2001, composer José Evangelista premiered the opera \\"Manuscrit trouvé à Saragosse\\" on a libretto by Alexis Nouss based on the novel.

Shraga Feivel pronounced his family name Mendelovich. His mother died when he was ten. He was twelve when the family relocated to Mezőlaborc (now ), where he studied \\"with Reb Aaron, dayyan of Mezo-Laboretz, who considered him his top pupil.\\" Having received semicha at age 17, he continued his studies under Rabbi Simcha Bunim Schreiber (the Shevet Sofer, grandson of the Chatam Sofer).

Activities  He actively sought positions in Germany and the United States, with the intention of disseminating knowledge of Judaism to Jews previously unexposed to their heritage, and in September 1913, he arrived alone in Philadelphia. He lived in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for seven years, teaching in the local Talmud Torah (afternoon program in Jewish studies). In 1920 he was able to bring his family from Hungary, and settled in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Reb Shraga Feivel joined forces with Chazan Yossele Rosenblatt in 1923, to produce Dos Yiddishe Licht, a short-lived English and Yiddish language weekly that included articles of comment and inspiration. It eventually became a daily but was forced to discontinue publication in 1927, because of financial difficulties. In fact, Chazan Rosenblatt went on a year-long concert tour to pay back the monies owed to creditors. September, 1983. The Light of Reb Shraga Feivel The Jewish Observer - Agudath Israel. The founding members of the yeshiva Torah Vodaath soon offered him the principalship of the institution. Originally starting off as an elementary school, Rabbi Shraga Feivel soon added the second Yeshiva high school in America. (The first being the Talmudical Academy, associated with Yeshiva College, founded in 1916.) The yeshiva opened its mesivta in 1926 and then under Rabbi Mendlowitz' direction, another early development in America (but also in competition with Yeshiva College), a post-graduate program. Rabbi Mendlowitz first appointed Rabbi Gedalia Schorr to the faculty of the Yeshiva, later to become its principal and Rosh Yeshiva. Despite his devotion to Torah Vodaath he assisted in the founding (both personally and financially) of several similar institutions, such as Mesivta Chaim Berlin (to which he relinquished a number of his top pupils), Telshe Cleveland and Beis Medrash Gevoha. All grew to occupy important places in 20th century American Orthodoxy. His work in Jewish education extended to several other organisations he founded. Aish Dos was a specialized institution that focused on teaching outreach skills, Torah U'mesora was a nationwide umbrella organization for Jewish day schools, and Beis Medrash Elyon was one of America's first post-graduate yeshivas (which also included a kollel).

Refinetti, in Encyclopedia of Ecology, 2008 Some types of biological rhythms have been described as biological clocks. They can range in frequency from microseconds to less than one repetitive event per decade. Biological rhythms are studied by chronobiology. The variations of the timing and duration of biological activity in living organisms occur for many essential biological processes. These occur (a) in animals (eating, sleeping, mating, hibernating, migration, cellular regeneration, etc.), (b) in plants (leaf movements, photosynthetic reactions, etc.), and in microbial organisms such as fungi and protozoa. They have even been found in bacteria, especially among the cyanobacteria (aka blue-green algae, see bacterial circadian rhythms). Circadian rhythm The best studied rhythm in chronobiology is the circadian rhythm, a roughly 24-hour cycle shown by physiological processes in all these organisms. The term circadian comes from the Latin circa, meaning \\"around\\" and dies, \\"day\\", meaning \\"approximately a day.\\" It is regulated by circadian clocks. The circadian rhythm can further be broken down into routine cycles during the 24-hour day:Nelson RJ. 2005. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology. Sinauer Associates, Inc.: Massachusetts. Pg587. * Diurnal, which describes organisms active during daytime * Nocturnal, which describes organisms active in the night * Crepuscular, which describes animals primarily active during the dawn and dusk hours (ex: white-tailed deer, some bats) While circadian rhythms are defined as regulated by endogenous processes, other biological cycles may be regulated by exogenous signals. In some cases, multi- trophic systems may exhibit rhythms driven by the circadian clock of one of the members (which may also be influenced or reset by external factors). The endogenous plant cycles may regulate the activity of the bacterium by controlling availability of plant-produced photosynthate. Other cycles Many other important cycles are also studied, including: * Infradian rhythms, which are cycles longer than a day. Examples include circannual or annual cycles that govern migration or reproduction cycles in many plants and animals, or the human menstrual cycle. * Ultradian rhythms, which are cycles shorter than 24 hours, such as the 90-minute REM cycle, the 4-hour nasal cycle, or the 3-hour cycle of growth hormone production. * Tidal rhythms, commonly observed in marine life, which follow the roughly 12.4-hour transition from high to low tide and back. * Lunar rhythms, which follow the lunar month (29.5 days). They are relevant e.g. for marine life, as the level of the tides is modulated across the lunar cycle. * Gene oscillations – some genes are expressed more during certain hours of the day than during other hours. Within each cycle, the time period during which the process is more active is called the acrophase.Refinetti, Roberto (2006). Circadian Physiology. CRC Press/Taylor & Francis Group. . Lay summary When the process is less active, the cycle is in its bathyphase or trough phase. The particular moment of highest activity is the peak or maximum; the lowest point is the nadir. How high (or low) the process gets is measured by the amplitude.

It is the smallest bear, standing nearly at the shoulder and weighing . It is stockily built, with large paws, strongly curved claws, small rounded ears and a short snout. The fur is generally jet-black, but can vary from grey to red. Sun bears get their name from the characteristic orange to cream coloured chest patch. Its unique morphology—inward-turned front feet, flattened chest, powerful forelimbs with large claws—suggests adaptations for climbing. The most arboreal (tree-living) of all bears, the sun bear is an excellent climber and sunbathes or sleeps in trees above the ground. It is mainly active during the day, though nocturnality might be more common in areas frequented by humans. Sun bears tend to remain solitary but sometimes occur in pairs (such as a mother and her cub). They do not seem to hibernate, possibly because food resources are available the whole year throughout the range. Being omnivores, sun bears have a broad diet including ants, bees, beetles, honey, termites and plant material such as seeds and several kinds of fruits; vertebrates such as birds and deer are also eaten occasionally. They breed throughout the year; individuals become sexually mature at two to four years of age. Litters comprise one or two cubs that remain with their mother for around three years. The range of the sun bear is bound by northeastern India to the north and extends south to southeast through Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in mainland Asia to Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia to the south. These bears are threatened by heavy deforestation and illegal hunting for food and the wildlife trade; they are also harmed in conflicts with humans when they enter farmlands, plantations and orchards. The global population is estimated to have declined by 35% over the past three decades. The IUCN has listed this species as vulnerable. Etymology The sun bear is named so for its characteristic orange to cream coloured, crescent-like chest patch. The generic name Helarctos comes from two Greek words: ήλιος (hēlios, 'related to the sun') and αρκτος (arctos, 'bear'). Another name is 'honey bear' (beruang madu in Malay), in reference to its habit of feeding on honey from honeycombs. 'Honey bear' can also refer to the kinkajou. Taxonomy and phylogeny The sun bear was first described in 1821 from Sumatra by British statesman Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles, who gave it the scientific name Ursus malayanus. In 1825, American naturalist Thomas Horsfield placed the species in a genus of its own, Helarctos. Two subspecies have been proposed on the basis of variations in size: * Malayan sun bear (H. m. malayanus) : Occurs on the Asian mainland and Sumatra. * Bornean sun bear (H. m. euryspilus) : Occurs only in Borneo. Its skull is smaller than that of the Malayan sun bear. H. anmamiticus, described by Pierre Marie Heude in 1901 from Annam, is not considered a distinct species, but is subordinated (a junior synonym) to H. m. malayanus. In 1906, Richard Lydekker proposed another subspecies by the name H. m. wardii for a sun bear skull, noting its similarities to a skull from Tibet with a thicker coat; however the Tibetan specimen was later found to be an Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus). Genetic differences between the two subspecies are obscure. In 2002, Christopher Fitzgerald and Paul Krausman (of the American Society of Mammalogists) considered the sun bear monotypic. The phylogenetic relationships among ursid species have remained ambiguous over the years. Noting the production of fertile hybrids between sun bears and sloth bears (Melursus ursinus), it was proposed that Helarctos be treated as a synonym of Melursus. However, studies differed on whether the two species were closely related. A 2007 phylogenetic study gives the relationships of the sun bear with other species of Ursidae based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences as shown in the cladogram below. The brown bear/polar bear lineage was estimated to have diverged from the two black bears/sun bear lineage around ; the sun bear appears to have diverged from the two black bears 5.09–6.26 mya. However, the phylogenetic tree constructed by a nuclear gene sequencing analysis in 2008 swapped the positions of the sun bear and the sloth bear obtained in the previous study; moreover, all relationships other these two positions were well resolved. The researchers noted the need for further study to fully resolve the relationship. Characteristics Skull, showing short snout. The sun bear is the smallest of all bear species. It is stockily built, with large paws, strongly curved claws, small rounded ears and a short snout. The head-and-body length is between , and the shoulder height is nearly . Adults weigh . The snout is grey, silver or orange. The fur is generally jet-black, but can vary from grey to red. The hair is silky and fine, and is the shortest of all bear species, suiting their hot tropical habitat. The characteristic chest patch, typically U-shaped but sometimes circular or spotlike, varies from orange or ochre-yellow to buff or cream, or even white. Some individuals may even lack the patch. Sun bears can expose the patch while standing on their hindfeet as a threat display against enemies. Infants are greyish black with a pale brown or white snout and the chest patch is dirty white; the coat of older juveniles may be dark brown. The underfur is particularly thick and black in adults, while the guard hairs are lighter. Two whirls occur on the shoulders, from whence the hair radiates in all directions. A crest is seen on the sides of the neck and a whorl occurs in the centre of the breast patch. The edges of the paws are tan or brown, and the soles are fur-less, which possibly is an adaptation for climbing trees. The claws are sickle-shaped; the front claws are long and heavy. The tail is long. The sympatric Asian black bear has cream-coloured chest markings of a similar shape as those of sun bears; a 2008 study discussed differences in claw markings of both bears as a means of identification. During feeding, the sun bear can extend its exceptionally long tongue by to extract insects and honey. The teeth are very large, especially the canines, and the bite force is high relative to its body size for reasons not well understood; a possible explanation could be its frequent opening of tropical hardwood trees with its powerful jaws and claws in pursuit of insects, larvae, or honey. The head is large, broad and heavy in proportion to the body, but the ears are proportionately smaller; the palate is wide in proportion to the skull. The overall unique morphology of this bear—inward-turned front feet, flattened chest, powerful forelimbs with large claws—indicates adaptations for extensive climbing. Ecology and behaviour arboreal of bears. Sun bears lead the most arboreal (tree-living) lifestyle among all bears. They are mainly active during the day, though nocturnality might be more common in areas frequented by humans. The sun bear is an excellent climber; it sunbathes or sleeps in trees above the ground. Bedding sites consist mainly of fallen hollow logs, but they also rest in standing trees with cavities, in cavities underneath fallen logs or tree roots, and in tree branches high above the ground. It is also an efficient swimmer. Sun bears are noted for their intelligence; a captive bear observed sugar being stored in a cupboard then locked by a key, and later used its own claw to open the lock. A study published in 2019 described skillful mimicry of facial expressions by sun bears, with precision comparable to that seen in some primates (such as gorillas and humans). Sun bears are shy and reclusive animals, and usually do not attack humans unless provoked to do so, or if they are injured or with their cubs; their timid nature led these bears to be tamed often and kept as pets in the past. They are typically solitary but are sometimes seen in pairs (such as mothers and cubs). Sun bears stand on their hindfeet for a broader view of their surroundings or smell far-off objects; they try to intimidate their enemies by displaying the chest patch if threatened. Vocalisations include grunts and snuffles while foraging for insects, and roars similar to those of a male orangutan during the breeding season; less commonly they may give out short barks (like a rhinoceros) when they are surprised. Sun bears do not seem to hibernate, possibly because food resources are available the whole year throughout the range. They occupy home ranges of varying sizes in different areas, ranging from in Borneo and peninsular Malaysia; a study in Ulu Segama Forest Reserve in Sabah (Malaysia) gave the sizes of ranges as . Tigers are major predators; dholes and leopards have also been recorded preying on sun bears but cases are relatively fewer. A wild female sun bear was swallowed by a large reticulated python in East Kalimantan. Diet Sun bears have a broad omnivorous diet including plants. Sun bears are omnivores and feed on a broad variety of items such as ants, bees, beetles, honey, termites and plant material such as seeds and several kinds of fruits. Vertebrates such as birds, deer, eggs and reptiles may be eaten occasionally. They forage mostly at night. Sun bears tear open hollow trees with their long, sharp claws and teeth in search of wild bees and honey. They also break termite mounds and quickly lick and suck the contents, holding pieces of the broken mound with their front paws. They consume figs in large amounts and eat them whole. In a study in the forests of Kalimantan, fruits of Moraceae, Burseraceae and Myrtaceae species made up more than 50% of the fruit diet; in times of fruit scarcity, sun bears switched to a more insectivorous diet. A study in Central Borneo revealed that sun bears play an important role in the seed dispersal of Canarium pilosum (a tree in the family Burseraceae). Sun bears eat the centre of coconut palms, and crush oil-rich seeds such as acorns. Oil palms are nutritious but not enough for subsistence. Reproduction Sun bears are polyoestrous; births occur throughout the year. Oestrus lasts five to seven days. Sun bears become sexually mature at two to four years of age. Reported lengths for pregnancies vary from 95 to 240 days; pregnancy tends to be longer in zoos in temperate climate possibly due to delay in implantation or fertilisation. Births occur inside hollow tree cavities. A litter typically comprises one or two cubs weighing around each. Cubs are born deaf with eyes closed. The eyes open at nearly 25 days but they remain blind till 50 days after birth; the sense of hearing improves over the first 50 days. Cubs younger than two months are dependent on external simulation for defecation. Cubs are kept on buttress roots at the base of trees until they learn how to walk and climb properly. Mothers protect their cubs aggressively. Offspring remain with their mother for nearly the first three years of their lives. Lifespan in captivity is generally over 20 years; one individual lived for nearly 31 years. Distribution and habitat Sun bear in the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre (Malaysia) Sun bears are found in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia; the range is bound by northeastern India to the north and extends south to southeast through Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in mainland Asia to Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia to the south. Their presence in China was confirmed after years in 2017 when they were sighted in Yingjiang County of Yunnan Province (China). Sun bears are extinct in Singapore. These bears dwell primarily in two main types of forests throughout their range: deciduous and seasonally evergreen forests to the north of the Isthmus of Kra, and non-seasonal evergreen forests in Indonesia and Malaysia. They are typically found at low altitudes, such as below in western Thailand and peninsular Malaysia. However, this varies widely throughout the range; in India larger numbers have been recorded at an elevation of up to than in low-lying areas, probably due to habitat loss at ground level. They occur in montane areas in northeast India, but may not extend farther north into the unfavourable and colder Himalayan region; their distribution might be restricted to the northwest due to competition with sloth bears. The sun bear is sympatric with the Asian black bear throughout the remaining areas in the mainland range featuring a mix of seasonal forest types, with monthly rainfall below for a long spell of three to seven months. In mountainous areas, Asian black bears are more common than sun bears, probably due to scarcity of invertebrates to feed on. The major habitats in southern Thailand and peninsular Malaysia are moist evergreen forests, with more or less non-varying climate and heavy rainfall throughout the year, and low-lying or montane dipterocarp forests. Mangroves may be inhabited, but usually only when they are close to preferred habitat types. Sun bears tend to avoid heavily logged forests and areas close to human settlement. However they have been seen in farmlands, plantations and orchards, where they may be considered vermin. A survey in Lower Kinabatagan (Malaysia) published in 2017 showed that sun bears were feared but were not common in oil palm plantations; bearded pigs, elephants and macaques were far more damaging to crops. Sun bears have been reported preying on poultry and livestock. In the past sun bears ranged from Borneo and Sumatra in the north and Assam in the northwest to northeastern Vietnam in the northeast and at least Yunnan Province (China) in the east. Fossil remains suggest their occurrence farther north in the Pleistocene; sun bears may have occurred as far south as Java (Indonesia) in the middle to late Pleistocene. Today they have been eliminated from majority of their erstwhile range, especially in Thailand; populations are declining in most of the range countries. Sun bears disappeared from Singapore, possibly due to extensive deforestation, during the 1800s and 1900s. Sun bear populations appear to decrease in size northward from Sundaland, and numbers are especially low in the northern and western extremes of the range. This has possibly been the case since prehistoric times and is not a result of human interference. Population densities vary from 4.3 and 5.9 individuals per in Khao Yai National Park (Thailand) to 26 individuals per in the Harapan Rainforest in southern Sumatra. Threats According to the IUCN Bear Specialist Group, sun bear populations have fallen by an estimated 35% in the last three decades. Numbers are especially low in Bangladesh and China, and populations in Vietnam are feared to decline severely by 50–80% in the next 30 years. Habitat fragmentation is on the rise particularly in Borneo, Sumatra and some areas of the mainland range. Heavy deforestation (due to agriculture, logging and forest fires) and hunting for wildlife trade are severe threats throughout the range; human-bear conflicts are a relatively minor threat. Compared to other continents, southeastern Asia has undergone severe depletion in forest cover over the past few decades (by almost 12% between 1990 and 2010); this has resulted in substantial habitat loss for forest-dependent species such as sun bears. A 2007 study in East Borneo recorded severe loss of habitat and food resources due to droughts and forest fires brought about by the El Niño. During surveys in Kalimantan between 1994 and 1997, interviewees admitted to hunting sun bears and indicated that sun bear meat is eaten by indigenous people in several areas in Kalimantan. There was evidence of pet trade and sale of sun bear parts such as gall bladders in traditional Chinese medicine shops in Sabah and Sarawak. Sun bears were killed by shooting or administering poison to protect coconut and snakefruit plantations in East Kalimantan. A report published by TRAFFIC in 2011 showed that sun bears, along with Asian black bears and brown bears, are specifically targeted for the bear bile trade in southeastern Asia, and are kept in bear farms in Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Poaching is common in several countries in the region. Hunting pressure is rising even in some protected areas; in the Nam Ha National Protected Area in Laos, hunter snares have been found that specifically target bears. A study in Nagaland (northeastern India) recorded a sparse distribution of sun bears in the Fakim and Ntangki National Parks, and reported extensive illegal hunting for food and trade in bear parts. Protective laws have shown little success in controlling these threats, especially due to poor execution and high potential for gains by the trade. Conservation measures The sun bear is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and is included in CITES Appendix I. With the exception of Sarawak (Malaysia) and Cambodia, the sun bear is legally protected from hunting in its whole range. A 2014 report documented rampant poaching and trade in sun bear parts in Sarawak, more than anywhere else in Malaysia; the researchers recommended stricter legislations in the state to protect local sun bears. The Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, founded by Wong Siew Te in Sabah (Malaysia) in 2008, aims to work for the welfare of sun bears rescued from poor conditions in captivity and spread awareness about their conservation. The Malayan sun bears are part of an international captive-breeding program and a Species Survival Plan under the Association of Zoos and Aquariums since late 1994. Since that same year, the European breed registry for sun bears is kept in the Cologne Zoological Garden, Germany.

Both the Quebec government and the Canadian government stated they were pleased with the Supreme Court's opinion, pointing to different sections of the ruling. Background Following the election of a majority of Parti Québécois (PQ) Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) in the 1976 Quebec provincial election, the party formed a government and, in 1980, held an independence referendum. The government of the Province of Quebec asked the province's population if it should seek a mandate to negotiate sovereignty for Quebec coupled with the establishment of a new political and economic union with Canada. The referendum resulted in the defeat of the sovereignty option, with 59.6% voting no on sovereignty. The PQ was nevertheless re-elected in 1981, this time promising not to hold a referendum. In 1982, the federal government petitioned the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London to amend Canada's constitution so that, in the future, all further amendments would take place by means of a process of consent involving only the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the provinces (several provinces objected). Up until this point, all amendments had taken place by means of Acts of the British Parliament, since the Canadian constitution was, strictly speaking, a simple statute of that Parliament. Colloquially, the switch to a domestic amendment procedure was known as patriation. The particular amending formula adopted in 1982 was opposed by the then-government of Quebec. Other concomitant constitutional changes such as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were also opposed by Quebec, although not necessarily based on rejection of their content but to the manner of their adoption and lack of amendments specific to Quebec in the package. (Also, at that time, Quebec had a more complete Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, which had been adopted in 1975.) Subsequently, two attempts were made at amending the Canadian constitution (the Meech Lake Accord in 1987–1990 and the Charlottetown Accord in 1992) that, it was hoped, would have caused the Quebec legislature to adopt a motion supporting the revised constitution. Following the failure of both of these to pass, there was a widespread sense in the mid-1990s that the Constitution of Canada was not fully legitimate because it had not yet received the formal approval of Quebec. In 1994, the Parti Québécois was re- elected and announced that it would be initiating a second referendum to take place in 1995. This time, the question was on sovereignty with an optional partnership with Canada. The \\"no\\" side won by only a narrow margin. Prior to this referendum, the National Assembly of Quebec had adopted a bill relating to the future of Quebec that laid out a plan if secession was approved in a referendum. In response to the bill and the referendum result, several legal actions were initiated by opponents to the independence of Quebec questioning the legality of secession. In 1996, Parti Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard announced his government would make plans to hold another referendum when he was confident that the \\"winning conditions\\" were there, pointing to the political cost of losing a third referendum. In reaction to Bouchard's stated plans, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien initiated a reference on the legality of a unilateral declaration of independence by a Canadian province. Questions addressed The Governor in Council (effectively, the Cabinet of Canada) submitted the request for an advisory opinion on the following three specific questions:  Submissions  There were an unprecedented 15 interveners. However, the Quebec government refused to take part and was not represented. In its place the Court appointed André Jolicoeur as an to present the argument Quebec may have made, had they participated. The federal government's submission argued that the only way a province could secede from Canada would be through a constitutional amendment. Only an amendment through section 45 (on the right of provincial legislatures to make laws amending their own constitutions) would allow for unilateral constitutional amendments, they argued, but that section would not apply to the question of secession. To attempt to secede unilaterally (that is, without negotiations) would violate the constitution on two grounds. First, it would violate the rule of law by ignoring the authority of the constitution as supreme law of the country, and second, it would violate Canadian federalism by acting with powers allocated only to the federal government. The s submission argued several points. First, it argued that the reference was invalid; the question is purely a political one and thus is outside the authority of the Court to answer under section 52 of the Supreme Court Act. It attempted to analogize the use of the US political question doctrine to the Canadian constitution. Furthermore, the question is speculative and premature as there are no substantive facts at question. Second, it focused on the second question, claiming that the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction over interpreting international law. The submission said that though Quebec could be considered a \\"peoples\\" under the Charter of the United Nations, the right to self-determination under that Charter applies to colonized, oppressed, etc. peoples and therefore does not apply to Quebec. It further claimed that since there is no international law barring separation then there must be an implied right to do so. The primary argument was that the doctrine of effectivity gave them authority to secede. That is, recognition of a new state by other countries would validate the separation. It further claimed that the doctrine of effectivity is part of constitutional conventions through its practice in other parts of the commonwealth. Several aboriginal interveners submitted on their right to stay in Canada based on treaties and their right to self-determination, further noting that they have already held two referendums, which decided against the separation of the aboriginal peoples from Canada. Their attacked the Attorney General's on the basis that it completely ignored the role of aboriginal people within the constitution. Opinion Right to secede under Canadian law The court addressed the three questions in order. First, they stated that, under the Canadian Constitution (and with Quebec being a party to it since its inception), unilateral secession was not legal. However, should a referendum decide in favour of independence, the rest of Canada \\"would have no basis to deny the right of the government of Quebec to pursue secession.\\" Negotiations would have to follow to define the terms under which Quebec would gain independence, should it maintain that goal. In this section of the judgement they stated that the Constitution is made up of written and unwritten principles (based on text, historical context, and previous constitutional jurisprudence) and that there are four fundamental tenets of the Canadian constitution. Those four interrelated and equally important principles or values are: # Federalism – the principle that seeks to “reconcile diversity with unity” by giving federal authority over only those issues of common interest amongst culturally diverse and politically independent provinces. The purpose of Canada's federalism is not only to create a loose association amongst provinces, but a true national unity. # Democracy – the principle that seeks to promote participation in effective representative self-government, which respects and responds to all voices in a marketplace of ideas. # Constitutionalism and the Rule of Law – the principles that protect citizens from state actions by forcing governments to act under the rule of law, the constitution of Canada being the supreme law. The constitution's entrenched protections of minorities ensure that the country does not operate simply on majority rule and enable a true democracy in which minority voices are fairly considered. # Protection of Minorities – the principle that guides the other principles, but one which is also independent and fundamental because of its uniqueness to Canada relative to other federal, constitutional democracies. They held that these pieces cannot be viewed independently but all interact as part of the Constitutional framework of Canada. Rights to secede under international law and self-determination The answer to the second question, which concerned Quebec's right under international law to secede, gave the opinion that the international law on secession was not applicable to the situation of Quebec. The court pointed out that international law \\"does not specifically grant component parts of sovereign states the legal right to secede unilaterally from their 'parent' state.\\" The Supreme Court of Canada's opinion stated that the right of a people to self-determination was expected to be exercised within the framework of existing states, by negotiation, for example. Such a right could only be exercised unilaterally under certain circumstances, under current international law. The court held that: : and that : The court stated in its opinion that, under international law, the right to secede was meant for peoples under a colonial rule or foreign occupation. Otherwise, so long as a people has the meaningful exercise of its right to self-determination within an existing nation state, there is no right to secede unilaterally. : The Supreme Court further stated that: Quebec could not, despite a clear referendum result, purport to invoke a right of self-determination to dictate the terms of a proposed secession to the other parties to the federation. The democratic vote, by however strong a majority, would have no legal effect on its own and could not push aside the principles of federalism and the rule of law, the rights of individuals and minorities, or the operation of democracy in the other provinces or in Canada as a whole. Which law applies in Canada? Since the court saw no conflict between Canadian law and international law on the question (neither would allow Quebec to secede unilaterally), it considered it unnecessary to answer the question.Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 SCR 217, 1998 CanLII 793 (SCC), retrieved on 2019-09-18. Significance The decision has been regarded as a model discussion in international law for questions of separation between national political entities, particularly in relation to the results of a referendum. The Quebec government of Lucien Bouchard stated that it was very pleased with the opinion of the Supreme Court. Premier Bouchard stated publicly that the court had validated the referendum strategy that the sovereigntists had adopted with René Lévesque. Quebec was most satisfied when the court made it clear that the question of Quebec's political status was above all a political question, not a legal one. It also liked the fact that the Supreme Court made it clear that the government of Canada and that of the other provinces would have to negotiate after a winning referendum on secession. This would make a unilateral declaration of independence unnecessary. The Canadian government of Jean Chrétien stated that it was pleased with the court's opinion. The Supreme Court had made it clear that Quebec could not declare independence unilaterally. Any obligation of Canada to negotiate with Quebec was conditional on the sovereigntists' asking a clear question within the context of a referendum. The government of Canada subsequently drafted the Clarity Act, which Parliament then enacted.

The record was released as the group's second single in May 1980 by Optional Music with \\"Police Truck\\" as the B-side. The photograph on the front cover of the single was taken from the Thammasat University massacre in Thailand, depicting a crowd member beating the hanged corpse of a student protester with a metal chair. The song was re-recorded for the band's first album, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980); the original recording of the song, as well as the single's B-side, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987). Composition The song was written shortly after the genocidal dictatorship of the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot and his Communist Party of Kampuchea, which is estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of roughly a quarter of the Cambodian population between 1975 and 1979. The lyrics are critical of disingenuous college-aged students in the Western world, contrasting their lifestyle with that of those under the Cambodian regime. The re-recording of this song that appears on Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables is different from the single version, being fifty-five seconds longer, at a higher tempo and featuring an extended, surf-influenced intro, as well as an extended bridge and guitar solo. Lawsuit In October 1998, Jello Biafra was sued by three former members of Dead Kennedys, who claimed that they had been defrauded of royalties owed to them. \\"The record industry has been skimming royalties owed artists since the beginning,\\" according to Dead Kennedys' guitarist East Bay Ray. \\"This case is no different from blues musicians being taken advantage of in the twenties and thirties... [T]here is no denying we were the victims here.\\" According to Biafra, the suit was the result of his refusal to allow \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\" to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's due to what he believes are their unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. Biafra lost the lawsuit and, as the owner of Alternative Tentacles, was ordered to pay $200,000 in damages to the other band members.

History The rank and position were based on those of the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps (established in its current incarnation on 23 May 1957). The Chief of Staff of the Army created the position in 1966 after asking leaders of the major commands for a personal recommendation. He asked that it not be considered a near-retirement type assignment. He listed seven duties and functions he expected the Sergeant Major to perform, including service as a personal adviser and assistant on matters pertaining to enlisted soldiers. From 4,700 proposed candidates, 21 nominees were selected. Finally chosen was the only one then serving in Vietnam, Sergeant Major William O. Wooldridge of the 1st Infantry Division. The other services later followed, creating the positions of Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force in 1967, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard in 1969, Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman in 2005, and Senior Enlisted Advisor of the Space Force in 2020.

Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions are at high concentrations in the extracellular region, and low concentrations in the intracellular regions. These concentration gradients provide the potential energy to drive the formation of the membrane potential. This voltage is established when the membrane has permeability to one or more ions. In the simplest case, illustrated here, if the membrane is selectively permeable to potassium, these positively charged ions can diffuse down the concentration gradient to the outside of the cell, leaving behind uncompensated negative charges. This separation of charges is what causes the membrane potential. Note that the system as a whole is electro-neutral. The uncompensated positive charges outside the cell, and the uncompensated negative charges inside the cell, physically line up on the membrane surface and attract each other across the lipid bilayer. Thus, the membrane potential is physically located only in the immediate vicinity of the membrane. It is the separation of these charges across the membrane that is the basis of the membrane voltage. This diagram is only an approximation of the ionic contributions to the membrane potential. Other ions including sodium, chloride, calcium, and others play a more minor role, even though they have strong concentration gradients, because they have more limited permeability than potassium. Key: pentagons – sodium ions; squares – potassium ions; circles – chloride ions; rectangles – membrane- impermeable anions (these arise from a variety of sources including proteins). The large structure with an arrow represents a transmembrane potassium channel and the direction of net potassium movement. Membrane potential (also transmembrane potential or membrane voltage) is the difference in electric potential between the interior and the exterior of a biological cell. For the exterior of the cell, typical values of membrane potential, normally given in units of millivolts and denoted as mV, range from –40 mV to –80 mV. All animal cells are surrounded by a membrane composed of a lipid bilayer with proteins embedded in it. The membrane serves as both an insulator and a diffusion barrier to the movement of ions. Transmembrane proteins, also known as ion transporter or ion pump proteins, actively push ions across the membrane and establish concentration gradients across the membrane, and ion channels allow ions to move across the membrane down those concentration gradients. Ion pumps and ion channels are electrically equivalent to a set of batteries and resistors inserted in the membrane, and therefore create a voltage between the two sides of the membrane. Almost all plasma membranes have an electrical potential across them, with the inside usually negative with respect to the outside. The membrane potential has two basic functions. First, it allows a cell to function as a battery, providing power to operate a variety of \\"molecular devices\\" embedded in the membrane. Second, in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells, it is used for transmitting signals between different parts of a cell. Signals are generated by opening or closing of ion channels at one point in the membrane, producing a local change in the membrane potential. This change in the electric field can be quickly affected by either adjacent or more distant ion channels in the membrane. Those ion channels can then open or close as a result of the potential change, reproducing the signal. In non-excitable cells, and in excitable cells in their baseline states, the membrane potential is held at a relatively stable value, called the resting potential. For neurons, typical values of the resting potential range from –70 to –80 millivolts; that is, the interior of a cell has a negative baseline voltage of a bit less than one-tenth of a volt. The opening and closing of ion channels can induce a departure from the resting potential. This is called a depolarization if the interior voltage becomes less negative (say from –70 mV to –60 mV), or a hyperpolarization if the interior voltage becomes more negative (say from –70 mV to –80 mV). In excitable cells, a sufficiently large depolarization can evoke an action potential, in which the membrane potential changes rapidly and significantly for a short time (on the order of 1 to 100 milliseconds), often reversing its polarity. Action potentials are generated by the activation of certain voltage-gated ion channels. In neurons, the factors that influence the membrane potential are diverse. They include numerous types of ion channels, some of which are chemically gated and some of which are voltage-gated. Because voltage-gated ion channels are controlled by the membrane potential, while the membrane potential itself is influenced by these same ion channels, feedback loops that allow for complex temporal dynamics arise, including oscillations and regenerative events such as action potentials. Physical basis The membrane potential in a cell derives ultimately from two factors: electrical force and diffusion. Electrical force arises from the mutual attraction between particles with opposite electrical charges (positive and negative) and the mutual repulsion between particles with the same type of charge (both positive or both negative). Diffusion arises from the statistical tendency of particles to redistribute from regions where they are highly concentrated to regions where the concentration is low. Voltage Electric field (arrows) and contours of constant voltage created by a pair of oppositely charged objects. The electric field is at right angles to the voltage contours, and the field is strongest where the spacing between contours is the smallest. Voltage, which is synonymous with difference in electrical potential, is the ability to drive an electric current across a resistance. Indeed, the simplest definition of a voltage is given by Ohm's law: V=IR, where V is voltage, I is current and R is resistance. If a voltage source such as a battery is placed in an electrical circuit, the higher the voltage of the source the greater the amount of current that it will drive across the available resistance. The functional significance of voltage lies only in potential differences between two points in a circuit. The idea of a voltage at a single point is meaningless. It is conventional in electronics to assign a voltage of zero to some arbitrarily chosen element of the circuit, and then assign voltages for other elements measured relative to that zero point. There is no significance in which element is chosen as the zero point—the function of a circuit depends only on the differences not on voltages per se. However, in most cases and by convention, the zero level is most often assigned to the portion of a circuit that is in contact with ground. The same principle applies to voltage in cell biology. In electrically active tissue, the potential difference between any two points can be measured by inserting an electrode at each point, for example one inside and one outside the cell, and connecting both electrodes to the leads of what is in essence a specialized voltmeter. By convention, the zero potential value is assigned to the outside of the cell and the sign of the potential difference between the outside and the inside is determined by the potential of the inside relative to the outside zero. In mathematical terms, the definition of voltage begins with the concept of an electric field , a vector field assigning a magnitude and direction to each point in space. In many situations, the electric field is a conservative field, which means that it can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function , that is, . This scalar field is referred to as the voltage distribution. Note that the definition allows for an arbitrary constant of integration—this is why absolute values of voltage are not meaningful. In general, electric fields can be treated as conservative only if magnetic fields do not significantly influence them, but this condition usually applies well to biological tissue. Because the electric field is the gradient of the voltage distribution, rapid changes in voltage within a small region imply a strong electric field; on the converse, if the voltage remains approximately the same over a large region, the electric fields in that region must be weak. A strong electric field, equivalent to a strong voltage gradient, implies that a strong force is exerted on any charged particles that lie within the region. Ions and the forces driving their motion alt=A schematic diagram of two beakers, each filled with water (light-blue) and a semipermeable membrane represented by a dashed vertical line inserted into the beaker dividing the liquid contents of the beaker into two equal portions. The left-hand beaker represents an initial state at time zero, where the number of ions (pink circles) is much higher on one side of the membrane than the other. The right-hand beaker represents the situation at a later time point, after which ions have flowed across the membrane from the high to low concentration compartment of the beaker so that the number of ions on each side of the membrane is now closer to equal. Electrical signals within biological organisms are, in general, driven by ions.Johnston and Wu, p. 9. The most important cations for the action potential are sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+).Bullock, Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 140–41. Both of these are monovalent cations that carry a single positive charge. Action potentials can also involve calcium (Ca2+),Bullock, Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 153–54. which is a divalent cation that carries a double positive charge. The chloride anion (Cl−) plays a major role in the action potentials of some algae, but plays a negligible role in the action potentials of most animals.Schmidt-Nielsen, p. 483. Ions cross the cell membrane under two influences: diffusion and electric fields. A simple example wherein two solutions—A and B—are separated by a porous barrier illustrates that diffusion will ensure that they will eventually mix into equal solutions. This mixing occurs because of the difference in their concentrations. The region with high concentration will diffuse out toward the region with low concentration. To extend the example, let solution A have 30 sodium ions and 30 chloride ions. Also, let solution B have only 20 sodium ions and 20 chloride ions. Assuming the barrier allows both types of ions to travel through it, then a steady state will be reached whereby both solutions have 25 sodium ions and 25 chloride ions. If, however, the porous barrier is selective to which ions are let through, then diffusion alone will not determine the resulting solution. Returning to the previous example, let's now construct a barrier that is permeable only to sodium ions. Now, only sodium is allowed to diffuse cross the barrier from its higher concentration in solution A to the lower concentration in solution B. This will result in a greater accumulation of sodium ions than chloride ions in solution B and a lesser number of sodium ions than chloride ions in solution A. This means that there is a net positive charge in solution B from the higher concentration of positively charged sodium ions than negatively charged chloride ions. Likewise, there is a net negative charge in solution A from the greater concentration of negative chloride ions than positive sodium ions. Since opposite charges attract and like charges repel, the ions are now also influenced by electrical fields as well as forces of diffusion. Therefore, positive sodium ions will be less likely to travel to the now-more-positive B solution and remain in the now-more-negative A solution. The point at which the forces of the electric fields completely counteract the force due to diffusion is called the equilibrium potential. At this point, the net flow of the specific ion (in this case sodium) is zero. Plasma membranes semipermeable lipid bilayer common to all living cells. It contains a variety of biological molecules, primarily proteins and lipids, which are involved in a vast array of cellular processes. Every animal cell is enclosed in a plasma membrane, which has the structure of a lipid bilayer with many types of large molecules embedded in it. Because it is made of lipid molecules, the plasma membrane intrinsically has a high electrical resistivity, in other words a low intrinsic permeability to ions. However, some of the molecules embedded in the membrane are capable either of actively transporting ions from one side of the membrane to the other or of providing channels through which they can move. In electrical terminology, the plasma membrane functions as a combined resistor and capacitor. Resistance arises from the fact that the membrane impedes the movement of charges across it. Capacitance arises from the fact that the lipid bilayer is so thin that an accumulation of charged particles on one side gives rise to an electrical force that pulls oppositely charged particles toward the other side. The capacitance of the membrane is relatively unaffected by the molecules that are embedded in it, so it has a more or less invariant value estimated at about 2 μF/cm2 (the total capacitance of a patch of membrane is proportional to its area). The conductance of a pure lipid bilayer is so low, on the other hand, that in biological situations it is always dominated by the conductance of alternative pathways provided by embedded molecules. Thus, the capacitance of the membrane is more or less fixed, but the resistance is highly variable. The thickness of a plasma membrane is estimated to be about 7-8 nanometers. Because the membrane is so thin, it does not take a very large transmembrane voltage to create a strong electric field within it. Typical membrane potentials in animal cells are on the order of 100 millivolts (that is, one tenth of a volt), but calculations show that this generates an electric field close to the maximum that the membrane can sustain—it has been calculated that a voltage difference much larger than 200 millivolts could cause dielectric breakdown, that is, arcing across the membrane. Facilitated diffusion and transport Facilitated diffusion in cell membranes, showing ion channels and carrier proteins The resistance of a pure lipid bilayer to the passage of ions across it is very high, but structures embedded in the membrane can greatly enhance ion movement, either actively or passively, via mechanisms called facilitated transport and facilitated diffusion. The two types of structure that play the largest roles are ion channels and ion pumps, both usually formed from assemblages of protein molecules. Ion channels provide passageways through which ions can move. In most cases, an ion channel is permeable only to specific types of ions (for example, sodium and potassium but not chloride or calcium), and sometimes the permeability varies depending on the direction of ion movement. Ion pumps, also known as ion transporters or carrier proteins, actively transport specific types of ions from one side of the membrane to the other, sometimes using energy derived from metabolic processes to do so. Ion pumps The sodium-potassium pump uses energy derived from ATP to exchange sodium for potassium ions across the membrane. Ion pumps are integral membrane proteins that carry out active transport, i.e., use cellular energy (ATP) to \\"pump\\" the ions against their concentration gradient. Such ion pumps take in ions from one side of the membrane (decreasing its concentration there) and release them on the other side (increasing its concentration there). The ion pump most relevant to the action potential is the sodium–potassium pump, which transports three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions in. As a consequence, the concentration of potassium ions K+ inside the neuron is roughly 20-fold larger than the outside concentration, whereas the sodium concentration outside is roughly ninefold larger than inside. In a similar manner, other ions have different concentrations inside and outside the neuron, such as calcium, chloride and magnesium. If the numbers of each type of ion were equal, the sodium–potassium pump would be electrically neutral, but, because of the three-for-two exchange, it gives a net movement of one positive charge from intracellular to extracellular for each cycle, thereby contributing to a positive voltage difference. The pump has three effects: (1) it makes the sodium concentration high in the extracellular space and low in the intracellular space; (2) it makes the potassium concentration high in the intracellular space and low in the extracellular space; (3) it gives the intracellular space a negative voltage with respect to the extracellular space. The sodium-potassium pump is relatively slow in operation. If a cell were initialized with equal concentrations of sodium and potassium everywhere, it would take hours for the pump to establish equilibrium. The pump operates constantly, but becomes progressively less efficient as the concentrations of sodium and potassium available for pumping are reduced. Ion pumps influence the action potential only by establishing the relative ratio of intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations. The action potential involves mainly the opening and closing of ion channels not ion pumps. If the ion pumps are turned off by removing their energy source, or by adding an inhibitor such as ouabain, the axon can still fire hundreds of thousands of action potentials before their amplitudes begin to decay significantly. In particular, ion pumps play no significant role in the repolarization of the membrane after an action potential. Another functionally important ion pump is the sodium-calcium exchanger. This pump operates in a conceptually similar way to the sodium-potassium pump, except that in each cycle it exchanges three Na+ from the extracellular space for one Ca++ from the intracellular space. Because the net flow of charge is inward, this pump runs \\"downhill\\", in effect, and therefore does not require any energy source except the membrane voltage. Its most important effect is to pump calcium outward—it also allows an inward flow of sodium, thereby counteracting the sodium-potassium pump, but, because overall sodium and potassium concentrations are much higher than calcium concentrations, this effect is relatively unimportant. The net result of the sodium-calcium exchanger is that in the resting state, intracellular calcium concentrations become very low. Ion channels alt=Seven spheres whose radii are proportional to the radii of mono-valent lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium cations (0.76, 1.02, 1.38, 1.52, and 1.67 Å, respectively), divalent calcium cation (1.00 Å) and mono-valent chloride (1.81 Å). Ion channels are integral membrane proteins with a pore through which ions can travel between extracellular space and cell interior. Most channels are specific (selective) for one ion; for example, most potassium channels are characterized by 1000:1 selectivity ratio for potassium over sodium, though potassium and sodium ions have the same charge and differ only slightly in their radius. The channel pore is typically so small that ions must pass through it in single-file order. * Channel pores can be either open or closed for ion passage, although a number of channels demonstrate various sub-conductance levels. When a channel is open, ions permeate through the channel pore down the transmembrane concentration gradient for that particular ion. Rate of ionic flow through the channel, i.e. single-channel current amplitude, is determined by the maximum channel conductance and electrochemical driving force for that ion, which is the difference between the instantaneous value of the membrane potential and the value of the reversal potential.Junge, pp. 33–37. alt=Schematic stick diagram of a tetrameric potassium channel where each of the monomeric subunits is symmetrically arranged around a central ion conduction pore. The pore axis is displayed perpendicular to the screen. Carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atom are represented by grey, red, and blue spheres, respectively. A single potassium cation is depicted as a purple sphere in the center of the channel. A channel may have several different states (corresponding to different conformations of the protein), but each such state is either open or closed. In general, closed states correspond either to a contraction of the pore—making it impassable to the ion—or to a separate part of the protein, stoppering the pore. For example, the voltage-dependent sodium channel undergoes inactivation, in which a portion of the protein swings into the pore, sealing it. This inactivation shuts off the sodium current and plays a critical role in the action potential. Ion channels can be classified by how they respond to their environment. For example, the ion channels involved in the action potential are voltage-sensitive channels; they open and close in response to the voltage across the membrane. Ligand-gated channels form another important class; these ion channels open and close in response to the binding of a ligand molecule, such as a neurotransmitter. Other ion channels open and close with mechanical forces. Still other ion channels—such as those of sensory neurons—open and close in response to other stimuli, such as light, temperature or pressure. Leakage channels Leakage channels are the simplest type of ion channel, in that their permeability is more or less constant. The types of leakage channels that have the greatest significance in neurons are potassium and chloride channels. Even these are not perfectly constant in their properties: First, most of them are voltage-dependent in the sense that they conduct better in one direction than the other (in other words, they are rectifiers); second, some of them are capable of being shut off by chemical ligands even though they do not require ligands in order to operate. Ligand-gated channels Ligand-gated calcium channel in closed and open states Ligand-gated ion channels are channels whose permeability is greatly increased when some type of chemical ligand binds to the protein structure. Animal cells contain hundreds, if not thousands, of types of these. A large subset function as neurotransmitter receptors—they occur at postsynaptic sites, and the chemical ligand that gates them is released by the presynaptic axon terminal. One example of this type is the AMPA receptor, a receptor for the neurotransmitter glutamate that when activated allows passage of sodium and potassium ions. Another example is the GABAA receptor, a receptor for the neurotransmitter GABA that when activated allows passage of chloride ions. Neurotransmitter receptors are activated by ligands that appear in the extracellular area, but there are other types of ligand-gated channels that are controlled by interactions on the intracellular side. Voltage-dependent channels Voltage-gated ion channels, also known as voltage dependent ion channels, are channels whose permeability is influenced by the membrane potential. They form another very large group, with each member having a particular ion selectivity and a particular voltage dependence. Many are also time-dependent—in other words, they do not respond immediately to a voltage change but only after a delay. One of the most important members of this group is a type of voltage-gated sodium channel that underlies action potentials—these are sometimes called Hodgkin-Huxley sodium channels because they were initially characterized by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in their Nobel Prize-winning studies of the physiology of the action potential. The channel is closed at the resting voltage level, but opens abruptly when the voltage exceeds a certain threshold, allowing a large influx of sodium ions that produces a very rapid change in the membrane potential. Recovery from an action potential is partly dependent on a type of voltage-gated potassium channel that is closed at the resting voltage level but opens as a consequence of the large voltage change produced during the action potential. Reversal potential The reversal potential (or equilibrium potential) of an ion is the value of transmembrane voltage at which diffusive and electrical forces counterbalance, so that there is no net ion flow across the membrane. This means that the transmembrane voltage exactly opposes the force of diffusion of the ion, such that the net current of the ion across the membrane is zero and unchanging. The reversal potential is important because it gives the voltage that acts on channels permeable to that ion—in other words, it gives the voltage that the ion concentration gradient generates when it acts as a battery. The equilibrium potential of a particular ion is usually designated by the notation Eion.The equilibrium potential for any ion can be calculated using the Nernst equation.Purves et al., pp. 28–32; Bullock, Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 133–134; Schmidt-Nielsen, pp. 478–480, 596–597; Junge, pp. 33–35 For example, reversal potential for potassium ions will be as follows: : E_{eq,K^+} = \\\\frac{RT}{zF} \\\\ln \\\\frac{[K^+]_{o}}{[K^+]_{i}} , where * Eeq,K+ is the equilibrium potential for potassium, measured in volts * R is the universal gas constant, equal to 8.314 joules·K−1·mol−1 * T is the absolute temperature, measured in kelvins (= K = degrees Celsius + 273.15) * z is the number of elementary charges of the ion in question involved in the reaction * F is the Faraday constant, equal to 96,485 coulombs·mol−1 or J·V−1·mol−1 * [K+]o is the extracellular concentration of potassium, measured in mol·m−3 or mmol·l−1 * [K+]i is the intracellular concentration of potassium Even if two different ions have the same charge (i.e., K+ and Na+), they can still have very different equilibrium potentials, provided their outside and/or inside concentrations differ. Take, for example, the equilibrium potentials of potassium and sodium in neurons. The potassium equilibrium potential EK is −84 mV with 5 mM potassium outside and 140 mM inside. On the other hand, the sodium equilibrium potential, ENa, is approximately +66 mV with approximately 12 mM sodium inside and 140 mM outside.Note that the signs of ENa and EK are opposite. This is because the concentration gradient for potassium is directed out of the cell, while the concentration gradient for sodium is directed into the cell. Membrane potentials are defined relative to the exterior of the cell; thus, a potential of −70 mV implies that the interior of the cell is negative relative to the exterior.  Changes to membrane potential during development  A neuron's resting membrane potential actually changes during the development of an organism. In order for a neuron to eventually adopt its full adult function, its potential must be tightly regulated during development. As an organism progresses through development the resting membrane potential becomes more negative. Glial cells are also differentiating and proliferating as development progresses in the brain. The addition of these glial cells increases the organism's ability to regulate extracellular potassium. The drop in extracellular potassium can lead to a decrease in membrane potential of 35 mV. Cell excitability Cell excitability is the change in membrane potential that is necessary for cellular responses in various tissues. Cell excitability is a property that is induced during early embriogenesis. Excitability of a cell has also been defined as the ease with which a response may be triggered. The resting and threshold potentials forms the basis of cell excitability and these processes are fundamental for the generation of graded and action potentials. The most important regulators of cell excitability are the extracellular electrolyte concentrations (i.e. Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl−, Mg2+) and associated proteins. Important proteins that regulate cell excitability are voltage-gated ion channels, ion transporters (e.g. Na+/K+-ATPase, magnesium transporters, acid–base transporters), membrane receptors and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels. For example, potassium channels and calcium-sensing receptors are important regulators of excitability in neurons, cardiac myocytes and many other excitable cells like astrocytes. Calcium ion is also the most important second messenger in excitable cell signaling. Activation of synaptic receptors initiates long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability. Thyroid, adrenal and other hormones also regulate cell excitability. Many cell types are considered to have an excitable membrane. Excitable cells are neurons, myocytes (cardiac, skeletal, smooth), vascular endothelial cells, juxtaglomerular cell, many types of epithelial cells (e.g. beta cells, alpha cells, delta cells), glial cells (e.g. astrocytes), mechanoreceptor cells (e.g. hair cells and Merkel cells), chemoreceptor cells (e.g. glomus cells, taste receptors), some plant cells and possibly immune cells. Astrocytes display a form of non-electrical excitability based on intracellular calcium variations related to the expression of several receptors through which they can detect the synaptic signal. In neurons, there are different membrane properties in some portions of the cell, for example, dendritic excitability endows neurons with the capacity for coincidence detection of spatially separated inputs. Equivalent circuit Equivalent circuit for a patch of membrane, consisting of a fixed capacitance in parallel with four pathways each containing a battery in series with a variable conductance Electrophysiologists model the effects of ionic concentration differences, ion channels, and membrane capacitance in terms of an equivalent circuit, which is intended to represent the electrical properties of a small patch of membrane. The equivalent circuit consists of a capacitor in parallel with four pathways each consisting of a battery in series with a variable conductance. The capacitance is determined by the properties of the lipid bilayer, and is taken to be fixed. Each of the four parallel pathways comes from one of the principal ions, sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. The voltage of each ionic pathway is determined by the concentrations of the ion on each side of the membrane; see the Reversal potential section above. The conductance of each ionic pathway at any point in time is determined by the states of all the ion channels that are potentially permeable to that ion, including leakage channels, ligand-gated channels, and voltage-gated ion channels. Reduced circuit obtained by combining the ion-specific pathways using the Goldman equation For fixed ion concentrations and fixed values of ion channel conductance, the equivalent circuit can be further reduced, using the Goldman equation as described below, to a circuit containing a capacitance in parallel with a battery and conductance. In electrical terms, this is a type of RC circuit (resistance-capacitance circuit), and its electrical properties are very simple. Starting from any initial state, the current flowing across either the conductance or the capacitance decays with an exponential time course, with a time constant of , where is the capacitance of the membrane patch, and is the net resistance. For realistic situations, the time constant usually lies in the 1—100 millisecond range. In most cases, changes in the conductance of ion channels occur on a faster time scale, so an RC circuit is not a good approximation; however, the differential equation used to model a membrane patch is commonly a modified version of the RC circuit equation. Resting potential When the membrane potential of a cell goes for a long period of time without changing significantly, it is referred to as a resting potential or resting voltage. This term is used for the membrane potential of non-excitable cells, but also for the membrane potential of excitable cells in the absence of excitation. In excitable cells, the other possible states are graded membrane potentials (of variable amplitude), and action potentials, which are large, all-or-nothing rises in membrane potential that usually follow a fixed time course. Excitable cells include neurons, muscle cells, and some secretory cells in glands. Even in other types of cells, however, the membrane voltage can undergo changes in response to environmental or intracellular stimuli. For example, depolarization of the plasma membrane appears to be an important step in programmed cell death. The interactions that generate the resting potential are modeled by the Goldman equation.Purves et al., pp. 32-33; Bullock, Orkand, and Grinnell, pp. 138-140; Schmidt-Nielsen, pp. 480; Junge, pp. 35-37 This is similar in form to the Nernst equation shown above, in that it is based on the charges of the ions in question, as well as the difference between their inside and outside concentrations. However, it also takes into consideration the relative permeability of the plasma membrane to each ion in question. : E_{m} = \\\\frac{RT}{F} \\\\ln{ \\\\left( \\\\frac{ P_{\\\\mathrm{K}}[\\\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_\\\\mathrm{out} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Na}}[\\\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_\\\\mathrm{out} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_\\\\mathrm{in}}{ P_{\\\\mathrm{K}}[\\\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_\\\\mathrm{in} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Na}}[\\\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_\\\\mathrm{in} + P_{\\\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_\\\\mathrm{out}} \\\\right) } The three ions that appear in this equation are potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl−). Calcium is omitted, but can be added to deal with situations in which it plays a significant role. Being an anion, the chloride terms are treated differently from the cation terms; the intracellular concentration is in the numerator, and the extracellular concentration in the denominator, which is reversed from the cation terms. Pi stands for the relative permeability of the ion type i. In essence, the Goldman formula expresses the membrane potential as a weighted average of the reversal potentials for the individual ion types, weighted by permeability. (Although the membrane potential changes about 100 mV during an action potential, the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell do not change significantly. They remain close to their respective concentrations when then membrane is at resting potential.) In most animal cells, the permeability to potassium is much higher in the resting state than the permeability to sodium. As a consequence, the resting potential is usually close to the potassium reversal potential.Purves et al., p. 34; Bullock, Orkand, and Grinnell, p. 134; Schmidt-Nielsen, pp. 478-480.Purves et al., pp. 33-36; Bullock, Orkand, and Grinnell, p. 131. The permeability to chloride can be high enough to be significant, but, unlike the other ions, chloride is not actively pumped, and therefore equilibrates at a reversal potential very close to the resting potential determined by the other ions. Values of resting membrane potential in most animal cells usually vary between the potassium reversal potential (usually around -80 mV) and around -40 mV. The resting potential in excitable cells (capable of producing action potentials) is usually near -60 mV—more depolarized voltages would lead to spontaneous generation of action potentials. Immature or undifferentiated cells show highly variable values of resting voltage, usually significantly more positive than in differentiated cells. In such cells, the resting potential value correlates with the degree of differentiation: undifferentiated cells in some cases may not show any transmembrane voltage difference at all. Maintenance of the resting potential can be metabolically costly for a cell because of its requirement for active pumping of ions to counteract losses due to leakage channels. The cost is highest when the cell function requires an especially depolarized value of membrane voltage. For example, the resting potential in daylight-adapted blowfly (Calliphora vicina) photoreceptors can be as high as -30 mV. This elevated membrane potential allows the cells to respond very rapidly to visual inputs; the cost is that maintenance of the resting potential may consume more than 20% of overall cellular ATP. On the other hand, the high resting potential in undifferentiated cells can be a metabolic advantage. This apparent paradox is resolved by examination of the origin of that resting potential. Little-differentiated cells are characterized by extremely high input resistance, which implies that few leakage channels are present at this stage of cell life. As an apparent result, potassium permeability becomes similar to that for sodium ions, which places resting potential in-between the reversal potentials for sodium and potassium as discussed above. The reduced leakage currents also mean there is little need for active pumping in order to compensate, therefore low metabolic cost. Graded potentials As explained above, the potential at any point in a cell's membrane is determined by the ion concentration differences between the intracellular and extracellular areas, and by the permeability of the membrane to each type of ion. The ion concentrations do not normally change very quickly (with the exception of Ca2+, where the baseline intracellular concentration is so low that even a small influx may increase it by orders of magnitude), but the permeabilities of the ions can change in a fraction of a millisecond, as a result of activation of ligand-gated ion channels. The change in membrane potential can be either large or small, depending on how many ion channels are activated and what type they are, and can be either long or short, depending on the lengths of time that the channels remain open. Changes of this type are referred to as graded potentials, in contrast to action potentials, which have a fixed amplitude and time course. As can be derived from the Goldman equation shown above, the effect of increasing the permeability of a membrane to a particular type of ion shifts the membrane potential toward the reversal potential for that ion. Thus, opening Na+ channels shifts the membrane potential toward the Na+ reversal potential, which is usually around +100 mV. Likewise, opening K+ channels shifts the membrane potential toward about –90 mV, and opening Cl− channels shifts it toward about –70 mV (resting potential of most membranes). Thus, Na+ channels shift the membrane potential in a positive direction, K+ channels shift it in a negative direction (except when the membrane is hyperpolarized to a value more negative than the K+ reversal potential), and Cl− channels tend to shift it towards the resting potential. Graph displaying an EPSP, an IPSP, and the summation of an EPSP and an IPSP Graded membrane potentials are particularly important in neurons, where they are produced by synapses—a temporary change in membrane potential produced by activation of a synapse by a single graded or action potential is called a postsynaptic potential. Neurotransmitters that act to open Na+ channels typically cause the membrane potential to become more positive, while neurotransmitters that activate K+ channels typically cause it to become more negative; those that inhibit these channels tend to have the opposite effect. Whether a postsynaptic potential is considered excitatory or inhibitory depends on the reversal potential for the ions of that current, and the threshold for the cell to fire an action potential (around –50mV). A postsynaptic current with a reversal potential above threshold, such as a typical Na+ current, is considered excitatory. A current with a reversal potential below threshold, such as a typical K+ current, is considered inhibitory. A current with a reversal potential above the resting potential, but below threshold, will not by itself elicit action potentials, but will produce subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. Thus, neurotransmitters that act to open Na+ channels produce excitatory postsynaptic potentials, or EPSPs, whereas neurotransmitters that act to open K+ or Cl− channels typically produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, or IPSPs. When multiple types of channels are open within the same time period, their postsynaptic potentials summate (are added together). Other values From the viewpoint of biophysics, the resting membrane potential is merely the membrane potential that results from the membrane permeabilities that predominate when the cell is resting. The above equation of weighted averages always applies, but the following approach may be more easily visualized. At any given moment, there are two factors for an ion that determine how much influence that ion will have over the membrane potential of a cell: #That ion's driving force #That ion's permeability If the driving force is high, then the ion is being \\"pushed\\" across the membrane. If the permeability is high, it will be easier for the ion to diffuse across the membrane. *Driving force is the net electrical force available to move that ion across the membrane. It is calculated as the difference between the voltage that the ion \\"wants\\" to be at (its equilibrium potential) and the actual membrane potential (Em). So, in formal terms, the driving force for an ion = Em \\\\- Eion *For example, at our earlier calculated resting potential of −73 mV, the driving force on potassium is 7 mV : (−73 mV) − (−80 mV) = 7 mV. The driving force on sodium would be (−73 mV) − (60 mV) = −133 mV. *Permeability is a measure of how easily an ion can cross the membrane. It is normally measured as the (electrical) conductance and the unit, siemens, corresponds to 1 C·s−1·V−1, that is one coulomb per second per volt of potential. So, in a resting membrane, while the driving force for potassium is low, its permeability is very high. Sodium has a huge driving force but almost no resting permeability. In this case, potassium carries about 20 times more current than sodium, and thus has 20 times more influence over Em than does sodium. However, consider another casethe peak of the action potential. Here, permeability to Na is high and K permeability is relatively low. Thus, the membrane moves to near ENa and far from EK. The more ions are permeant the more complicated it becomes to predict the membrane potential. However, this can be done using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation or the weighted means equation. By plugging in the concentration gradients and the permeabilities of the ions at any instant in time, one can determine the membrane potential at that moment. What the GHK equations means is that, at any time, the value of the membrane potential will be a weighted average of the equilibrium potentials of all permeant ions. The \\"weighting\\" is the ions relative permeability across the membrane. Effects and implications While cells expend energy to transport ions and establish a transmembrane potential, they use this potential in turn to transport other ions and metabolites such as sugar. The transmembrane potential of the mitochondria drives the production of ATP, which is the common currency of biological energy. Cells may draw on the energy they store in the resting potential to drive action potentials or other forms of excitation. These changes in the membrane potential enable communication with other cells (as with action potentials) or initiate changes inside the cell, which happens in an egg when it is fertilized by a sperm. In neuronal cells, an action potential begins with a rush of sodium ions into the cell through sodium channels, resulting in depolarization, while recovery involves an outward rush of potassium through potassium channels. Both of these fluxes occur by passive diffusion.

He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Connacht–Ulster constituency from 1979 to 1989. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Mayo South constituency from 1951 to 1969 and for the Mayo East constituency from 1969 to 1977. Early life and education Flanagan was born in Coolnaha, Aghamore, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo in 1922. He was educated locally, then later at St Jarlath's College in Tuam, County Galway, where he showed enthusiasm for sport. He won two Connacht championship medals with the college in 1939 and in 1940. He later studied at Clonliffe College in Dublin, and then enrolled in University College Dublin, where he studied law and qualified as a solicitor. Football career Flanagan also played senior Gaelic football for Mayo. He captained the All- Ireland final-winning sides of 1950 and 1951, and won five Connacht senior championship medals in all. He also won two National Football League titles in 1949 and 1954. While still a footballer, Flanagan entered into a career in politics. In recognition of his skills and long-running contribution to the sport, Flanagan was awarded the 1992 All-time all-star award as no GAA All Stars Awards were being issued at the time of his playing career. In 1984, the Gaelic Athletic Association centenary year he was honoured by being named on their Football Team of the Century. In 1999, he was again honoured by the GAA by being named on their Gaelic Football Team of the Millennium. Political career Flanagan came from a Fianna Fáil family, and was recruited into the party in east Mayo. He was elected a Fianna Fáil TD for Mayo South at the 1951 general election, and won a seat—first there, then from 1969 in Mayo East—at each subsequent election until he lost his seat at the 1977 general election. Flanagan rose rapidly through the party ranks, and was appointed a Parliamentary Secretary under Taoiseach Seán Lemass in 1959. In the Fianna Fáil leadership election in 1966 Flanagan supported Jack Lynch. When Lynch became Taoiseach, Flanagan was promoted to the Cabinet as Minister for Health. Three years later in 1969, he became Minister for Lands. Flanagan lost his seat at the 1977 general election, and effectively retired from domestic politics; however, he was elected to the European Parliament in the first direct elections in 1979. He was re-elected in 1984, and retired from politics in 1989. Flanagan died on 5 February 1993, at the age of 71.

She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1965 to 1969, 1973 to 1981 and 1981 to 1987. She served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Munster constituency from 1979 to 1984. She was a Senator for the Industrial and Commercial Panel from 1969 to 1973.  Life  She was born in Kinsale, County Cork, and educated locally at the Convent of Mercy in Kinsale, where she was one of only two girls in her class to sit the Leaving Certificate examination. Before entering politics she worked as a civil servant with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Desmond was first elected to Dáil Éireann in a by-election on 10 March 1965, caused by the death of her husband Dan Desmond who had been a TD since 1948. Her victory in the Cork Mid constituency led Taoiseach Seán Lemass to dissolve the 17th Dáil and call a general election. She was elected for the second time in a year, but lost her seat at the 1969 general election. However, Desmond was then elected to the 12th Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial Panel, where she served until her re-election to the 20th Dáil following the 1973 general election. She was elected to the European Parliament at the 1979 European Parliament election for the Munster constituency. However, her time in Europe was short- lived, as she returned to domestic politics when she was offered a position as Minister and the chance to impact upon national legislation. At the 1981 general election she switched her constituency to Cork South-Central. A Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition came to power and Desmond was appointed Minister for Health and for Social Welfare. Desmond was only the second woman to be appointed to cabinet since the foundation of the state in 1922, and the first in a Fine Gael-Labour Party cabinet. Constance Markievicz had held the cabinet post of Minister for Labour in the revolutionary First Dáil in 1919, but only Máire Geoghegan-Quinn of Fianna Fáil, who was appointed as Minister for the Gaeltacht in 1979, had held cabinet office after the foundation of the state Desmond retired from full-time politics at the 1987 general election for health reasons. She died suddenly in 2005.

He previously served as Leader of the Labour Party from 2016 to 2020, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform from 2011 to 2016, Leas-Cheann Comhairle from 2007 to 2011, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party from 1997 to 2002, Minister for the Environment from 1994 to 1997 and Minister for Health from 1993 to 1994. He was a Senator from 1983 to 1987, after being nominated by the Taoiseach. Early life Born into a highly political family in Wexford, Howlin is the son of John and Molly Howlin (née Dunbar), and named after Brendan Corish, the local Labour TD and future leader of the Labour Party. Howlin's father was a trade union official who served as secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, in Wexford, for 40 years. He also secured election as a Labour member of Wexford Corporation, where he served for eighteen years, and was also election agent to Brendan Corish. Howlin's mother was also strongly involved in local Labour politics. Howlin grew up in Wexford town and was educated locally at Wexford CBS. He later attended St Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dublin, and qualified as a primary school teacher. During his career as a teacher he was active in the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, before embarking on a career in full-time politics. Political career Early years (1982–1993) Howlin contested his first general election at the November 1982 election. He ran as a Labour candidate in the Wexford constituency, but despite the existence of a large left-wing vote in the area, Howlin was not elected. In spite of this setback, a Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government came to power and he was nominated by the Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald to serve in Seanad Éireann as a Senator. Howlin secured election to Wexford County Council in 1985 and served as Mayor of Wexford in 1986. In 1987, the Labour Party withdrew from the coalition government and a general election was called. Howlin once again contested a seat in Wexford and was elected to Dáil Éireann. Labour were out of office as a Fianna Fáil government took office. In spite of his recent entry to the Dáil, Howlin was subsequently named Chief Whip of the Labour Party, a position he held until 1993. Cabinet minister (1993–1997) The 1992 general election resulted in a hung Dáil once again; however, the Labour Party enjoyed their best result to date at the time. After negotiations, a Fianna Fáil- Labour Party coalition government came to office. Howlin joined the cabinet of Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, as Minister for Health. During his tenure the development of a four-year health strategy, the identifying of HIV/AIDS prevention as a priority and the securing of a £35 million investment in childcare were advanced. Howlin, however, was also targeted by anti-abortion groups after introducing an act which would allow information regarding abortion. In 1994, the Labour Party withdrew from government after a disagreement over the appointment of Attorney General Harry Whelehan as a Judge of the High Court and President of the High Court. However, no general election was called and, while it was hoped that the coalition could be revived under the new Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern, the arithmetic of the Dáil now allowed the Labour Party to open discussions with other opposition parties. After negotiations a Rainbow Coalition came to power involving Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left. In John Bruton's cabinet, he became Minister for the Environment. Leadership contender (1997) Following the 1997 general election, a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition government came to power and the Labour Party returned to the opposition benches. In the announcement of the party's new front bench, Howlin retained responsibility for the Environment. In late 1997, Dick Spring resigned as leader of the Labour Party and Howlin immediately threw his hat into the ring in the subsequent leadership election. In a choice between Howlin and Ruairi Quinn, the former gained some early support; however, the leadership eventually went to Quinn by a significant majority. As a show of unity Howlin was later named deputy leader of the party and retained his brief as Spokesperson for the Environment and Local Government. Leadership contender (2002) In 2002, following Quinn's resignation as party leader after Labour's relatively unsuccessful 2002 general election campaign, Howlin again stood for the party leadership. For the second time in five years Howlin was defeated for the leadership of the party, this time by Pat Rabbitte, who was formerly a leading figure in Democratic Left. Howlin was succeeded as deputy leader by Liz McManus. While having been publicly supportive of Rabbitte's leadership, he was perceived as being the leader of the wing of the party which was sceptical of Rabbitte's policy with regard to future coalition with Fianna Fáil. Rabbitte explicitly ruled out any future coalition with Fianna Fáil, instead forming a formal alliance with Fine Gael in the run-up to the 2007 general election (the so-called Mullingar Accord). Leas-Cheann Comhairle (2007–2011) On 26 June 2007, Howlin was appointed the Leas-Cheann Comhairle (Deputy chairman) of Dáil Éireann. Cabinet minister (2011–2016) Howlin (front left) in 2013. After the 2011 general election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed a government, Howlin was appointed to the new office of Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In May 2011, he said that over the next 20 years the number of people in Ireland over 65 is set to increase by almost half a million, a situation that could see the annual health budget soar – rising by €12.5 billion in the next decade alone. While reform was a major part of government attempts \\"to regain full sovereignty over economic policy\\", Howlin told a meeting of the Association of Chief Executives of State Agencies they would in any event face key \\"imperatives\\" in coming years. He said a new public spending review, on which he had briefed the cabinet in recent days, would not be a simple assessment of where to make cuts, but would also consider the way public sector services were delivered. Howlin reiterated the government's commitment not to cut public sector pay, \\"if the Croke Park Agreement works\\". \\"These are just some of the challenges that our society is facing in the coming decade – crisis or no crisis. In the good times, tackling them was going to be difficult. Today, in these difficult times, tackling them is going to be imperative.\\" Howlin said Ireland was facing a profound and complex economic crisis \\"where we are fighting a battle on three fronts – mass unemployment, a major failure in banking, and a fiscal crisis\\". Analysis of budgets Budgets 2012 to 2016 - introduced in part by Brendan Howlin as Minister for Public Expenditure and supported by Labour \\\\- were described by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) as \\"regressive\\". It found \\"Budget 2012 involved greater proportionate losses for those on low incomes: reductions of about 2 to 2½ per cent for those with the lowest incomes, as against losses of about ¾ of a per cent for those on the highest incomes\\". By contrast, the ESRI found earlier budgets in 2008-2010 to be \\"strongly progressive\\" because before 2011 \\"Losses imposed by policy changes in tax and welfare have been greatest for those on the highest incomes, and smaller for those on low incomes\\". However, it concluded \\"Budget 2014 had its greatest impact – a reduction of 2 per cent – on low income groups\\". The ESRI described Budget 2015 as having a \\"pattern of losses in the bottom half of the income distribution, declining as income rises, and gains in the upper reaches\\", which \\"can clearly be described as regressive\\". Labour Party leadership (2016–2020) Howlin retained his seat in the Dáil following the 2016 general election, though only six of his Labour colleagues did likewise and the party returned to the opposition benches. Following the resignation of Joan Burton, Howlin contested the 2016 Labour Party leadership election unopposed and was elected Leader of the Labour Party on 20 May 2016. Criticism of the Taoiseach for failing to invite Howlin to meet ambulance crews In March 2018, Howlin criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for failing to personally invite him to accompany Varadkar as he met ambulance crews in Howlin's constituency of Wexford. Varadkar replied that he had been far too busy dealing with the recent weather crisis and Brexit \\"to organise invitations to Deputies personally in order that they [Howlin] felt included\\". It was separately said of Howlin's complaint \\"It appears that the Taoiseach, the chief executive of the State, needs the imprimatur of local politicians when he enters their bailiwick, and needs to be accompanied and monitored by those same politicians while he is in their realm.\\" Leadership challenge Alan Kelly challenged Howlin for the party leadership in 2018, stating that he had failed to 'turn the ship around'. Howlin stated that Kelly's comments were a disappointing and unnecessary distraction. Howlin also said that there was not a single parliamentary party member that supported the challenge and that Kelly had the backing of a minority of councillors. Howlin told The Irish Times that there was no formal proposition made to the Central Council (which would deal with any formal leadership challenge). 2020 general election In September 2018, Howlin stated that winning 14 seats in the 33rd Dail was a realistic goal. During the campaign in 2020, Howlin stated that his wish to end the U.S.A's use of Shannon airport for military related activities. In the 2020 general election party first preference vote dropped to 4.4% of first preference votes and returned 6 seats - a record low. Howlin announced his intention to step down as leader on the 12 February 2020. He also said that the Labour Party should not formally enter government, a view that was backed by the parliamentary party. He also stated that he would not back any candidate in the following contest. On 15 February 2020, Howlin ruled himself out as a candidate for Ceann Comhairle of the 33rd Dail, with the polling day to elect his successor set for 3 April 2020. Personal life Howlin is a single man. He has spoken publicly of receiving hate mail relating to his private life and questioning his sexual orientation. In an interview with The Star during the 2002 Labour Party leadership contest, in response to repeated speculation, he announced he was \\"not gay\\".

He collaborated with Antoine du Val and Fouquart de Cambrai in putting together a collection of stories entitled L'Évangile des quenouilles (\\"The spinners' gospel\\"). The frame story is a group of ladies at their spinning who relate the current theories on a great variety of subjects. The work is of considerable value for the light it throws on medieval manners, and for its echoes of folklore, sometimes deeply buried under layers of Christianity. There were many editions of this book in the 15th and 16th centuries, one of which was printed by the early printer Wynkyn de Worde in English, as The Gospelles of Dystaves. A more modern edition (Collection Jannet) had a preface by Anatole France. The Roman de Mélusine Jean d'Arras, perhaps the same, wrote at the request of John, duke of Berry, as he says in his introduction, a long prose romance variously called the Roman de Mélusine or the Chronique de Melusine part of Le Noble Hystoire de Lusignan (\\"The Noble History of the Lusignans\\"), in 1392-94. He dedicated the work to Marie of Valois, Duchess of Bar and expressed the hope that it would aid in the political education of her children. Leaning on perhaps mostly oral tradition surrounding the originally Celtic region of Poitou, it is one of the first literary versions of the tale of Melusine, a fairy cursed by her fairy mother to become a hybrid woman/serpent every Saturday. If she married a mortal man who remained faithful to her and obeyed her request never to seek her out on that day, she would gain the status of a mortal woman and enjoy salvation as a Christian. She guided the spectacular rise and subsequent fall of the House of Lusignan after she met the nobleman Rainmondin by a fountain in the forest, who married her and fathered ten sons on her whose exploits in the Crusades brought them fame, despite the fact that most of them carried some form of physical blemish. Raimondin remains faithful to his promise until he is persuaded to believe that her hiding every Saturday is an excuse for her to entertain a lover, and he spies on her in her bath. He doesn't betray her secret until one of their most deformed sons, Geoffrey Big-Tooth, burns down the monastery his brother Fromont has retired to. In despair, Raimondin curses her publicly for her demonic nature that has infected their sons, and she turns into a dragon and flies away, wailing. For more information consult the Wikipedia article on Melusine. : Notes Bibliography * Donald Maddox and Sara Sturm-Maddox, Melusine of Lusignan: founding fiction in late medieval France.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed May 13, 2011 in the U.S. states of Wisconsin and Illinois. The river was known as the Sinnissippi to Sauk and Fox Indians; the name means \\"rocky waters\\". The river begins with three separate branches which flow into the Horicon Marsh. The northernmost branch, the West Branch, begins just to the west of the village of Brandon in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin and flows east and then south to Horicon Marsh. The South Branch rises north of Fox Lake in Dodge County and flows east through Waupun to the marsh. The East Branch rises southeast of Allenton in Washington County just west of the Niagara Escarpment, and flows north and west through Theresa to the marsh. Leaving the marsh, it meanders southward to the Illinois border ending about 300 miles later at the Mississippi River at the Quad Cities in Illinois and Iowa. During its course it passes through Watertown, collects the Crawfish River in Jefferson, and receives the Bark River at Fort Atkinson. Shortly before merging, the Rock and Crawfish rivers cross Interstate 94. Both rivers flood the nearby land regularly, and lanes on I-94 were temporarily closed in 2008 because of this flooding. In northern Rock County, Wisconsin, it receives the Yahara River, and flows southward through tiny Fulton, Janesville and Beloit into northern Illinois, where it receives the Pecatonica River 5 miles (8 km) south of the state line. It flows south through Rockford, then southwest across northwestern Illinois, picking up the Kishwaukee River, passing Oregon, Dixon, Sterling (which has the Sinnissippi Mounds national historic site and local park) and Rock Falls before joining the Mississippi at Rock Island. It was on the Rock River in Dixon where Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard.City of Dixon. \\"Reagan's Roots\\". Reagan's favorite fishing spot, now called \\"Dutch Landing\\" after Reagan's nickname, was just southwest of Lowell Park on the Rock River. There are 25 dams on the Rock River. These are in Theresa (WI, 3 dams), Waupun (WI), Horicon (WI), Mayville (WI, 2 dams), Kekoskee (WI), Hustisford (WI), Watertown (WI, 2 dams), Jefferson (WI, 4 dams), Indianford (WI), Janesville (WI), Beloit (WI), Rockton (IL), Rockford Fordham (IL), Oregon (IL), Dixon (IL), Sterling / Rock Falls (IL, 2 dams), Milan (IL) and Rock Island (IL). The Rock River Trail in Dodge County, Wisconsin The river is used for various water and paddling sports. The Rock River Water Trail is on the river from its headwaters above the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge in south central Wisconsin to the confluence with the Mississippi River at the Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa 330 miles downriver. It crosses five counties in Wisconsin, six counties in Illinois and runs through 37 municipalities. The slow moving river passes scenic rural landscapes, wilderness areas and urban areas. The first two trailheads are at Waupun County Park in Waupun, Wisconsin and Rivers Edge Park in Theresa, Wisconsin and there are 32 additional access points in Dodge County, Wisconsin. The trail is part of the National Water Trails System and the first National Water Trail in Wisconsin and Illinois.

Background  The central focus of the album is the band's movement away from the raw, thrashy sound pioneered and captured on their first release, the live album Kick Out the Jams (1969). This was due in part to producer Jon Landau's distaste for the rough psychedelic rock movement, and his adoration for the straightforward rock and roll of the 1950s. Landau, who originally wrote for Rolling Stone magazine, was looking to get more involved in actual music production. Becoming close with Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler was his chance and led Landau to the politically radical MC5, who had just been picked up by Atlantic after being dropped from Elektra Records in 1969 – the Kinney National Company (later known as Time Warner), parent of Atlantic, acquired Elektra in the same year of this album's release; both labels are now part of the Warner Music Group (now a separate company from TW), through the Atlantic Records Group.  Content  The opening track is a cover of the classic hit \\"Tutti Frutti\\" by Little Richard. \\"Let Me Try\\" is a ballad. \\"The American Ruse\\" attacks what the Detroit quintet saw as the hypocritical idea of freedom espoused by the US government, and \\"The Human Being Lawnmower\\" expresses opposition to the US involvement in the Vietnam War. The last song on the album, which is the title track, is a cover of Chuck Berry's 1959 single \\"Back in the U.S.A.\\"  Release and reception  Reviewing Back in the USA for Rolling Stone in 1970, Greil Marcus admired the album's \\"attempt to define themes and problems and an offering of political, social, and emotional solutions\\", but found that \\"the music, the sound, and in the end the care with which these themes have been shaped drags it down, save for two or three fine numbers that deserve to be played on every jukebox in the land\\". Though the album was viewed as a flop early on by most fans, and lacked the commercial success of their previous release, it would later be considered highly important due to the album's absolute projection of MC5's core sound and earliest influences. In his retrospective review, Jason Ankeny of AllMusic wrote, \\"While lacking the monumental impact of Kick Out the Jams, the MC5's second album is in many regards their best and most influential\\".  Legacy  : In 2012, Back in the USA was ranked number 446 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The following year, NME placed the album at number 490 on its own similar list.

He lived in Christchurch with his partner Nicola Shirlaw, and their three daughters. Early political career Donald held Values Party membership from 1974 to 1979 and then Labour Party membership from 1982 to 1988. On becoming national spokesperson of the impartial Electoral Reform Coalition from 1989 to 1993 he had to resign his party membership. After the success of the MMP referendum at the 1993 election he joined the Green Party in February 1994. After he became co-leader of the Greens in 1995, voters first elected him to Parliament in the 1996 election as an Alliance list MP. The Green Party left the Alliance to stand alone in the 1999 election. He entered the 1999 parliament as number two on the Greens' party list. He retained his list seat in the 2002 and 2005 elections. Member of Parliament For many years Donald had a special interest in electoral reform in New Zealand. From 1989 to 1993 he served as spokesperson for the Electoral Reform Coalition during the campaign that led to the introduction of mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation. Subsequently, he played a major part in getting legislation passed to allow STV voting in local body elections in New Zealand. Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons described MMP as Donald's greatest legacy. He also served as the Green Party spokesperson on Buy Kiwi Made, commerce, electoral reform, finance and revenue, land information, regional development and small business, superannuation, sustainable economics, state services, statistics, tourism, trade, and waste. Death Shortly after midnight on 6 November 2005, the day before his scheduled swearing-in for his fourth term in Parliament, he died suddenly at his Christchurch home after suffering for a few days from Campylobacter jejuni food poisoning from an unknown source. An autopsy initially ruled out a heart attack, but subsequent test-results determined that death resulted from an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis), which is a very rare consequence of C. jejuni infection. He was 48 years old. His funeral, which took place at the Cathedral of ChristChurch, was attended by over 1,000 people. His casket arrived on board an electric bus and his wake took place at the adjacent Warner's Hotel. The Parliament showed its respect for Donald by suspending a day of business, and a minute of silence was observed in the House of Representatives.

They include diverse potentials such as receptor potentials, electrotonic potentials, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, slow-wave potential, pacemaker potentials, and synaptic potentials, which scale with the magnitude of the stimulus. They arise from the summation of the individual actions of ligand- gated ion channel proteins, and decrease over time and space. They do not typically involve voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels.. \\"Chapter 6. Ligand-gated channels of fast chemical synapses.\\" These impulses are incremental and may be excitatory or inhibitory. They occur at the postsynaptic dendrite in response to presynaptic neuron firing and release of neurotransmitter, or may occur in skeletal, smooth, or cardiac muscle in response to nerve input. The magnitude of a graded potential is determined by the strength of the stimulus. EPSPs Graded potentials that make the membrane potential less negative or more positive, thus making the postsynaptic cell more likely to have an action potential, are called excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Depolarizing local potentials sum together, and if the voltage reaches the threshold potential, an action potential occurs in that cell. EPSPs are caused by the influx of Na+ or Ca2+ from the extracellular space into the neuron or muscle cell. When the presynaptic neuron has an action potential, Ca2+ enters the axon terminal via voltage-dependent calcium channels and causes exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, causing neurotransmitter to be released. The transmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and activates ligand-gated ion channels that mediate the EPSP. The amplitude of the EPSP is directly proportional to the number of synaptic vesicles that were released. If the EPSP is not large enough to trigger an action potential, the membrane subsequently repolarizes to its resting membrane potential. This shows the temporary and reversible nature of graded potentials. IPSPs Graded potentials that make the membrane potential more negative, and make the postsynaptic cell less likely to have an action potential, are called inhibitory post synaptic potentials (IPSPs). Hyperpolarization of membranes is caused by influx of Cl− or efflux of K+. As with EPSPs, the amplitude of the IPSP is directly proportional to the number of synaptic vesicles that were released. Summation The resting membrane potential is usually around –70 mV. The typical neuron has a threshold potential ranging from –40 mV to –55 mV. Temporal summation occurs when graded potentials within the postsynaptic cell occur so rapidly that they build on each other before the previous ones fade. Spatial summation occurs when postsynaptic potentials from adjacent synapses on the cell occur simultaneously and add together. An action potential occurs when the summated EPSPs, minus the summated IPSPs, in an area of membrane reach the cell's threshold potential.

He undertook much of the pioneering work on silicon polymers and coined the term silicone. Life He was born in Salford, Lancashire, England, the son of James Kipping, a Bank of England official, and Julia Du Val, a daughter of painter Charles Allen Du Val. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School before enrolling in 1879 at Owens College (now Manchester University) for an external degree from the University of London. After working for the local gas company for a short time he went in 1886 to Germany to work under William Henry Perkin, Jr. in the laboratories of Adolf von Baeyer at Munich University. Back in England, he took a position as demonstrator for Perkin, who had been appointed professor at Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh. In 1890, Kipping was appointed chief demonstrator in chemistry for the City and Guilds of London Institute, where he worked for the chemist Henry Edward Armstrong. In 1897 he moved to University College, Nottingham as professor of the chemistry department, and became the first newly endowed Sir Jesse Boot professor of chemistry at the university in 1928. He remained there until his retirement in 1936. Achievements Kipping undertook much of the pioneering work into the development of silicon polymers (silicones) at Nottingham. He pioneered the study of the organic compounds of silicon (organosilicon) and coined the term silicone. His research formed the basis for the worldwide development of the synthetic rubber and silicone-based lubricant industries.Asimov, Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology 2nd Revised edition He also co-wrote, with Perkin, a standard textbook on organic chemistry (Organic Chemistry, Perkin and Kipping, 1899). He was awarded the Longstaff Medal (now Longstaff Prize) by the Chemistry Society (now Royal Society of Chemistry) in 1909. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June, 1897. He was awarded their Davy Medal in 1918 and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1936 and was awarded a Royal Society Bakerian Medal in the same year. Family He retired in 1936 and died in Criccieth, Wales. He married Lilian Holland in 1888, one of three sisters and both his brothers-in-law were eminent scientists themselves: Arthur Lapworth and William Henry Perkin, Jr. He had four children including Cyril Henry Stanley who became a famous chess player and headmaster of Wednesbury Boys School and Frederick Barry who was also eminent in chemistry and later edited his father's Organic Chemistry textbook.

The spheres located in the upper neuron contain neurotransmitters that fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors located on the postsynaptic membrane of the lower neuron, and, in the case of an excitatory synapse, may lead to a depolarization of the postsynaptic cell. An excitatory synapse is a synapse in which an action potential in a presynaptic neuron increases the probability of an action potential occurring in a postsynaptic cell. Neurons form networks through which nerve impulses travel, each neuron often making numerous connections with other cells. These electrical signals may be excitatory or inhibitory, and, if the total of excitatory influences exceeds that of the inhibitory influences, the neuron will generate a new action potential at its axon hillock, thus transmitting the information to yet another cell. This phenomenon is known as an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). It may occur via direct contact between cells (i.e., via gap junctions), as in an electrical synapse, but most commonly occurs via the vesicular release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic axon terminal into the synaptic cleft, as in a chemical synapse. The excitatory neurotransmitters, the most common of which is glutamate, then migrate via diffusion to the dendritic spine of the postsynaptic neuron and bind a specific transmembrane receptor protein that triggers the depolarization of that cell. Depolarization, a deviation from a neuron's resting membrane potential towards its threshold potential, increases the likelihood of an action potential and normally occurs with the influx of positively charged sodium (Na+) ions into the postsynaptic cell through ion channels activated by neurotransmitter binding. Chemical vs electrical synapses Animation showing the function of a chemical synapse. :There are two different kinds of synapses present within the human brain: chemical and electrical. Chemical synapses are by far the most prevalent and are the main player involved in excitatory synapses. Electrical synapses, the minority, allow direct, passive flow of electric current through special intercellular connections called gap junctions. These gap junctions allow for virtually instantaneous transmission of electrical signals through direct passive flow of ions between neurons (transmission can be bidirectional). The main goal of electrical synapses is to synchronize electrical activity among populations of neurons. The first electrical synapse was discovered in a crayfish nervous system. :Chemical synaptic transmission is the transfer of neurotransmitters or neuropeptides from a presynaptic axon to a postsynaptic dendrite. Unlike an electrical synapse, the chemical synapses are separated by a space called the synaptic cleft, typically measured between 15 and 25 nm. Transmission of an excitatory signal involves several steps outlined below. Synaptic transmission # In neurons that are involved in chemical synaptic transmission, neurotransmitters are synthesized either in the neuronal cell body, or within the presynaptic terminal, depending on the type of neurotransmitter being synthesized and the location of enzymes involved in its synthesis. These neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles that remain bound near the membrane by calcium-influenced proteins. # In order to trigger the process of chemical synaptic transmission, upstream activity causes an action potential to invade the presynaptic terminal. # This depolarizing current reaches the presynaptic terminal, and the membrane depolarization that it causes there initiates the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels present on the presynaptic membrane. # There is high concentration of calcium in the synaptic cleft between the two participating neurons (presynaptic and postsynaptic). This difference in calcium concentration between the synaptic cleft and the inside of the presynaptic terminal establishes a strong concentration gradient that drives the calcium into the presynaptic terminal upon opening of these voltage-gated calcium channels. This influx of calcium into the presynaptic terminal is necessary for neurotransmitter release. # After entering the presynaptic terminal, the calcium binds a protein called synaptotagmin, which is located on the membrane of the synaptic vesicles. This protein interacts with other proteins called SNAREs in order to induce vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane. As a result of this vesicle fusion, the neurotransmitters that had been packaged into the synaptic vesicle are released into the synapse, where they diffuse across the synaptic cleft. # These neurotransmitters bind to a variety of receptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane. In response to neurotransmitter binding, these postsynaptic receptors can undergo conformational changes that may open a transmembrane channel subunit either directly, or indirectly via a G-Protein signaling pathway. The selective permeability of these channels allow certain ions to move along their electrochemical gradients, inducing a current across the postsynaptic membrane that determines an excitatory or inhibitory response. Responses of the postsynaptic neuron :When neurotransmitters reach the postsynaptic neuron of an excitatory synapse, these molecules can bind to two possible types of receptors that are clustered in a protein-rich portion of the postsynaptic cytoskeleton called the Postsynaptic density (PSD). Ionotropic receptors, which are also referred to as ligand-gated ion channels, contain a transmembrane domain that acts as an ion channel and can directly open after binding of a neurotransmitter. Metabotropic receptors, which are also called G-protein-coupled receptors, act on an ion channel through the intracellular signaling of a molecule called a G protein. Each of these channels has a specific reversal potential, Erev, and each receptor is selectively permeable to particular ions that flow either into or out of the cell in order to bring the overall membrane potential to this reversal potential. If a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor with a reversal potential that is higher than the threshold potential for the postsynaptic neuron, the postsynaptic cell will be more likely to generate an action potential and an excitatory postsynaptic potential will occur (EPSP). On the other hand, if the reversal potential of the receptor to which the neurotransmitter binds is lower than the threshold potential, an inhibitory postsynaptic potential will occur (IPSP). :Although the receptors at an excitatory synapse strive to bring the membrane potential towards their own specific Erev, the probability that the single stimulation of an excitatory synapse will raise the membrane potential past threshold and produce an action potential is not very high. Therefore, in order to achieve threshold and generate an action potential, the postsynaptic neuron has the capacity to add up all of the incoming EPSPs based on the mechanism of summation, which can occur in time and space. Temporal summation occurs when a particular synapse is stimulated at a high frequency, which causes the postsynaptic neuron to sum the incoming EPSPs and thus increases the chance of the neuron firing an action potential. In a similar way, the postsynaptic neuron can sum together EPSPs from multiple synapses with other neurons in a process called spatial summation. Types of excitatory neurotransmitters Acetylcholine :Acetylcholine (ACh) is an excitatory, small-molecule neurotransmitter involved in synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions controlling the vagus nerve and cardiac muscle fibers, as well as in the skeletal and visceral motor systems and various sites within the central nervous system. This neurotransmitter crosses the synaptic cleft and binds to a variety of postsynaptic receptors depending on the species, but all of these receptors depolarize the postsynaptic membrane and thus classify ACh as an excitatory neurotransmitter. Glutamate :Glutamate is a small, amino acid neurotransmitter, and is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter at almost all synapses in the central nervous system. This molecule binds multiple postsynaptic receptors including the NMDA receptor, AMPA receptor, and kainate receptors. These receptors are all cation channels that allow positively charged ions such as Na+, K+, and sometimes Ca2+ into the postsynaptic cell, causing a depolarization that excites the neuron. Catecholamines :The catecholamines, which include Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, and Dopamine, are excitatory biogenic amine neuromodulators that are derived from the amino acid tyrosine and serve as excitatory neurotransmitters at various locations in the central nervous system as well as the peripheral nervous system. Epinephrine and norepinephrine, also called adrenaline and noradrenaline, respectively, bind a number of G-protein-coupled receptors that induce their depolarizing effects on the postsynaptic cell in various ways, including activating and inactivating certain K+ channels. Epinephrine is found in the lateral tegmental system, medulla, hypothalamus, and thalamus of the central nervous system, but their function is not fully understood. Norepinephrine is found in the brain stem and is involved in sleep and wakefulness, feeding behavior, and attention. Dopamine binds to G-protein- coupled receptors in many areas of the brain, especially the corpus striatum where it mediates the synaptic transmission that underlies the coordination of body movements. Serotonin :Serotonin is an excitatory neurotransmitter that regulates sleep and wakefulness and is found in neurons of the raphe region of the pons and upper brain stem, which extend into the forebrain. Serotonin binds a number of receptors, including the 5-HT3 receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels that allow the passage of cations in order to depolarize the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron that they reside on. Levels of serotonin activity that are lower than normal have been linked to a variety of symptoms, especially depression, which is why many antidepressant drugs act to increase serotonin activity. Histamine :Histamine acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter by binding G-protein coupled receptors in neurons of the hypothalamus. These neurons project into many regions of the brain and spinal cord, allowing histamine to mediate attention, arousal, and allergic responses. Of the four types of histamine receptors (H1 \\\\- H4), H3 is found in the central nervous system and is responsible for regulating histamine effects on neurotransmission. Disease :Excitatory synapses have a fundamental role in information processing within the brain and throughout the peripheral nervous system. Usually situated on dendritic spines, or neuronal membrane protrusions on which glutamate receptors and postsynaptic density components are concentrated, excitatory synapses aid in the electrical transmission of neuronal signals. The physical morphology of synapses is crucial in understanding their function, and it is well documented that the inappropriate loss of synaptic stability leads to the disruption of neuronal circuits and the resulting neurological diseases. Although there are innumerable different causes for different neurodegenerative illnesses, such as genetic dispositions or mutations, the normal aging process, parasitic and viral causes, or drug use, many can be traced back to dysfunctional signaling between the neurons themselves, often at the synapse. Excitotoxicity Pathophysiology :Since glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter involved in synaptic neuronal transmission, it follows that disruptions in the normal functioning of these pathways can have severe detrimental effects on the nervous system. A major source of cellular stress is related to glutaminergic overstimulation of a postsynaptic neuron via excessive activation of glutamate receptors (i.e., NMDA and AMPA receptors), a process known as excitotoxicity, which was first discovered accidentally by D. R. Lucas and J. P. Newhouse in 1957 during experimentation on sodium-fed lab mice. :Under normal conditions, extracellular glutamate levels are held under strict control by surrounding neuronal and glial cell membrane transporters, rising to a concentration of about 1 mM and quickly falling to resting levels. These levels are maintained via the recycling of glutamate molecules in the neuronal-glial cell process known as the glutamate–glutamine cycle, in which glutamate is synthesized from its precursor glutamine in a controlled manner in order to maintain an adequate supply of the neurotransmitter. However, when glutamate molecules in the synaptic cleft cannot be degraded or reused, often due to dysfunction of the glutamate–glutamine cycle, the neuron becomes significantly overstimulated, leading to a neuronal cell death pathway known as apoptosis. Apoptosis occurs primarily via the increased intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which flow into the cytosol through the activated glutamate receptors and lead to the activation of phospholipases, endonucleases, proteases, and thus the apoptotic cascade. Additional sources of neuronal cell death related to excitotoxicity involve energy rundown in the mitochondria and increased concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species within the cell. Treatment :Excitotoxic mechanisms are often involved in other conditions leading to neuronal damage, including hypoglycemia, trauma, stroke, seizures, and many neurodegenerative diseases, and thus have important implications in disease treatment. Recent studies have been performed that incorporate glutamate receptor antagonists and excitotoxic cascade disruptors in order to decrease stimulation of postsynaptic neurons, although these treatments are still undergoing active research. Related neurodegenerative diseases :Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, or loss of brain function, and was first described by German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer in 1907. 9. Diagnosis of the disease often stems from clinical observation as well as analysis of family history and other risk factors, and often includes symptoms such as memory impairment and problems with language, decision-making, judgment, and personality. The primary neurological phenomena that lead to the above symptoms are often related to signaling at excitatory synapses, often due to excitotoxicity, and stem from the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as neuronal cell death and synaptic pruning. The principle drug treatments on the market deal with antagonizing glutamate (NMDA) receptors at neuronal synapses, and inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase. This treatment aims to limit the apoptosis of cerebral neurons caused by various pathways related to excitotoxicity, free radicals, and energy rundown. A number of labs are currently focusing on the prevention of amyloid plaques and other AD symptoms, often via the use of experimental vaccines, although this area of research is yet in its infancy. Histological brain sample of the Substantia Nigra in Parkinson's disease, showing the presence of Lewy bodies and other signs of neurodegeneration. :Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system, especially the substantia nigra, as well as heightened response to the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate (i.e., excitotoxicity). While the most obvious symptoms are related to motor skills, prolonged progression of the disease can lead to cognitive and behavioral problems as well as dementia. Although the mechanism of apoptosis in the brain is not entirely clear, speculation associates cell death with abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in cell occlusions known as Lewy bodies, as well as hyperstimulation of neuronal NMDA receptors with excessive glutamate neurotransmitter via the aforementioned pathway. Like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease lacks a cure. Therefore, in addition to lifestyle changes and surgery, the goal of pharmaceutical drugs used in the treatment of PD patients is to control symptoms and limit, when possible, the progression of the disease. Levodopa (L-DOPA), the most widely used treatment of PD, is converted to dopamine in the body and helps to relieve the effect of decreased dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system. Other dopamine agonists have been administered to patients in an effort to mimic dopamine’s effect at excitatory synapses, binding its receptors and causing the desired postsynaptic response.

She purchased the site in 1949 and lived and worked there for 26 years until her death in a fire on the premises in 1975. History Hepworth's workshop left virtually untouched The studio, known as Trewyn Studio, was purchased by Barbara Hepworth in 1949, and is typical of the stone-built houses in St Ives. Her living room is furnished as she left it, while the workshop remains full of her tools and equipment, materials, and part-worked pieces. The museum was opened by her family in 1976, after Barbara had left instructions to this effect in her will. It is the largest collection of her works that are on permanent display. The sculptures featured at the museum (mainly in the secluded garden) were some of her favourites. Her workshop also includes a queue of uncut stones that one visitor has described as \\"still waiting for their moment in the shadow of her workshop\\". In 1950 she acquired two huge blocks of Galway limestone which she carved into her Festival of Britain commission, the Contrapuntal Forms. A set of photographs in the museum shows the progress of this project. Wood carving was done in an upstairs room, and the bronze statues she started casting in 1956 had their origins in the plaster prototypes she worked on in the upper of the two outside studios. She was helped in the creation of the garden by her friend, the South African-born composer Priaulx Rainier. Barbara Hepworth died in a fire at this site in 1975, which was caused by one of her cigarettes making some package burn, when she was aged 72. The family passed the museum to the Tate gallery in 1980 and they still manage it.

It is the world's second-largest reinsurer. It acquired GE Insurance Solutions in 2006. Founded in 1863, Swiss Re operates through offices in more than 25 countries. Swiss Re was ranked 118th in Forbes 2000 Global leading companies 2016. It was also ranked 313th in Fortune Global 500 in 2015. History On 10/11 May 1861, more than 500 houses went up in flames in the town of Glarus. Two-thirds of the town sank into rubble and ashes; around 3,000 inhabitants were made homeless. Like the fire of Hamburg in 1842, which led to the foundation of the first professional reinsurers in Germany, the great fire of Glarus in 1861 showed that insurance coverage was totally inadequate in Switzerland in the event of such a catastrophe. The Swiss Reinsurance Company of Zurich was founded on 19 December 1863 by the Helvetia General Insurance Company (now known as Helvetia Versicherungen) in St. Gallen, the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (Credit Suisse) in Zurich and the Basler Handelsbank (predecessor of UBS AG) in Basel. The company's articles of association were approved by the government of the Canton of Zurich on the same day. The foundation capital, which was 15% paid up, amounted to 6 million Swiss francs. The official foundation document bore the signature of the poet Gottfried Keller, who at the time was first secretary of the Canton of Zurich. Swiss Re was the lead insurer of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks which led to an insurance dispute with the owner, Silverstein Properties. In October 2006, the New York appeals court ruled in favor of Swiss Re, stating that the destruction of the twin towers was a single event rather than two, limiting coverage to 3.5 billion USD. The UK Admin Re business of Swiss Re began with the acquisition on 1 July 2004 of Life Assurance Holding Corporation. On 31 October 2008, Swiss Re completed a £762 million acquisition of Barclays PLC's subsidiary Barclays Life Assurance Company Ltd. In June 2014, the company through Admin Re acquired the UK pensions business of HSBC Life (UK) Limited worth £4.2 billion. The Admin Re business, which was renamed ReAssure, was eventually sold to Phoenix Group Holdings for £3.2bn in July 2020. In 2009, Warren Buffett invested $2.6 billion as a part of Swiss Re's raising equity capital Berkshire Hathaway already owns a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20%.

Life and career  Machiko was born in Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan. She had humble upbringings and was raised to be a singer, though her talents were with acting. She was “discovered” after doing a play in Tokyo Center. From that night on, her life would forever change as she met many important figures in the world of Japanese television. Her mother died when she was a child; she was raised by her father. She had two brothers and a sister. One of her brothers died during the Second World War; the other is still alive. Her father died of cancer in 1991. In 1973, she went to study in Italy for two years. After taking jazz dance lessons for a number of years, her first roles were mainly radio and voice character roles. She made her debut on NHK’s radio drama Chorinmura to Kurumi no Ki (1961), and later gained fame as the first voice actor to portray the lovable ghost Q-taro in Obake no Q-tarō (TBS, 1965-1968). However, she is best known to fans of tokusatsu for her villainous roles in the Super Sentai franchise such as Queen Hedrian in Denziman and Sun Vulcan, she also appeared in Maskman portraying Tube Empire's field commander, Baraba's mother for one episode, as well as the evil sorceress Bandora in Zyuranger, better known to audiences in English speaking countries as Rita Repulsa in the American adaptation of Zyuranger, Power Rangers. In an odd twist, she soon found herself re-dubbing her own lines as Rita when Power Rangers was broadcast in Japan after the show became a surprise hit in America. Her final tokusatsu role was Magiel, Queen of the Sky Saints in Magiranger, which incidentally was one of her few non-villainous roles. In her memory, the producers of Power Rangers: Mystic Force used footage of Soga as Magiel to depict a reformed Rita Repulsa in the two-part final episode of Mystic Force, “Mystic Fate”. Her very final role was in the PlayStation 2 game Space Sheriff Spirits as the voice and the “face” of Ankoku Ginga Jyoou (Dark Galaxy Queen), last boss and original character of this game inspired to the 80s Metal Hero series. Soga also played the voices of Cyborg 007 in the 1968 Cyborg 009 anime series and the sidekick Ball Boy in 1984 series Machineman. Machiko also ran her own shop, selling jewellery, antique clothing, and tapestry among other goods.  Death  In early August 2005, it was revealed that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer about two years earlier. On the morning of May 7, 2006, she was found dead by a friend visiting her home. She was 68 years old. Her interment was in Fuchū, Tokyo's Tama Cemetery.

It is a concept album, recounting the short stories and poems of Edgar Allan Poe through word and song, and was based on his 2000 opera co-written with Robert Wilson, POEtry. The Raven features new and very different versions of two songs that Reed had released on earlier albums: \\"Perfect Day\\" (originally found on 1972's Transformer) and \\"The Bed\\" (from 1973's Berlin). In addition to Reed, the album features a number of guest vocalists including Laurie Anderson, David Bowie, Antony Hegarty, Steve Buscemi and Willem Dafoe. The co-producer of the album, Hal Willner, had previously overseen the Poe tribute album Closed on Account of Rabies. The recording was simultaneously released as a two-disc set of recordings and in an edited single-disc version. Painter and filmmaker Julian Schnabel created the cover. The Raven would prove to be the final solo rock album by Reed, as 2007's Hudson River Wind Meditations consisted entirely of meditational new- age music, and 2011's Lulu was a collaborative rock album with heavy metal band Metallica.

See also * Biogenic minerals References Category:Geological processes Category:Natural materials ","title":"Biogenic substance"},{"id":"563245","text":"A biogenic amine is a biogenic substance with one or more amine groups. They are basic nitrogenous compounds formed mainly by decarboxylation of amino acids or by amination and transamination of aldehydes and ketones. Biogenic amines are organic bases with low molecular weight and are synthesized by microbial, vegetable and animal metabolisms. In food and beverages they are formed by the enzymes of raw material or are generated by microbial decarboxylation of amino acids.  List of notable biogenic amines  Monoamines Some prominent examples of biogenic monoamines include: Monoamine neurotransmitters * Imidazoleamines  Histamine – a substance derived from the amino acid histidine that acts as a neurotransmitter mediating arousal and attention, as well as a pro-inflammatory signal released from mast cells in response to allergic reactions or tissue damage. Histamine is also an important stimulant of HCl secretion by the stomach through histamine H2 receptors. * Indolamines  Serotonin – a central nervous system neurotransmitter derived from the amino acid tryptophan involved in regulating mood, sleep, appetite, and sexuality. * The three catecholamine neurotransmitters:  Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) – a neurotransmitter involved in sleep and wakefulness, attention, and feeding behavior, as well as a stress hormone released by the adrenal glands that regulates the sympathetic nervous system.  Epinephrine (adrenaline) – an adrenal stress hormone, as well as a neurotransmitter present at lower levels in the brain.  Dopamine – a neurotransmitter involved in motivation, reward, addiction, behavioral reinforcement, and coordination of bodily movement. Trace amines (endogenous amines that activate the human TAAR1 receptor) Tryptamines * N-Methyltryptamine * N,N-Dimethyltryptamine Other biogenic monoamines * Trimethylamine * Trimethylamine N-oxide * Indoleamines  Melatonin  6-Hydroxymelatonin  N-Acetylserotonin Polyamines Examples of notable biogenic polyamines include: * Agmatine * Cadaverine * Putrescine * Spermine * Spermidine  Physiological importance  There is a distinction between endogenous and exogenous biogenic amines. Endogenous amines are produced in many different tissues (for example: adrenaline in adrenal medulla or histamine in mast cells and liver). The amines are transmitted locally or via the blood system. The exogenous amines are directly absorbed from food in the intestine. Alcohol can increase the absorption rate. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) breaks down biogenic amines and prevents excessive resorption. MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are also used as medications for the treatment of depression to prevent MAO from breaking down amines important for positive mood.  Importance in food  Biogenic amines can be found in all foods containing proteins or free amino acids and are found in a wide range of food products including fish products, meat products, dairy products, wine, beer, vegetables, fruits, nuts and chocolate. In non-fermented foods the presence of biogenic amines is mostly undesired and can be used as indication for microbial spoilage. In fermented foods, one can expect the presence of many kinds of microorganisms, some of them being capable of producing biogenic amines. Some lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial bottled yoghurt has been shown to produce biogenic amines. They play an important role as source of nitrogen and precursor for the synthesis of hormones, alkaloids, nucleic acids, proteins, amines and food aroma components. However, food containing high amounts of biogenic amines may have toxicological effects.  Determination of biogenic amines in wines  Biogenic amines are naturally present in grapes or can occur during the vinification and aging processes, essentially due to the microorganism's activity. When present in wines in high amount, biogenic amines may cause not only organoleptic defects but also adverse effects in sensitive human individuals, namely due to the toxicity of histamine, tyramine and putrescine. Even though there are no legal limits for the concentration of biogenic amines in wines, some European countries only recommend maximum limits for histamine. In this sense, biogenic amines in wines have been widely studied. The determination of amines in wines is commonly achieved by liquid chromatography, using derivatization reagents in order to promote its separation and detection. In alternative, other promising methodologies have been developed using capillary electrophoresis or biosensors, revealing lower costs and faster results, without needing a derivatization step. It is still a challenge to develop faster and inexpensive techniques or methodologies to apply in the wine industry. 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

It rises in the hills of southwest Wisconsin, in southwest Dane County, approximately southwest of Madison. The headwaters are at the southern terminus of the last North American glacier. West of the river, the land elevates from lack of glaciation and joins what is known as the \\"driftless area\\", known for its abrupt hills and valleys, covering most of southwest Wisconsin. From its source, the river meanders southeast, past Paoli and Belleville, where it is dammed to form Lake Belle View. From there it meanders east of Monticello where it is joined by the Little Sugar River and flows south through Albany, and Brodhead. It crosses into northern Illinois flowing past an extensive area of the Forest Preserves of Winnebago County system. These preserves are Sugar River Alder, Colored Sands, and Sugar River. The river joins the Pecatonica River in northern Winnebago County near Shirland, approximately south of the state line and approximately north- northwest of Rockford. The Sugar River State Trail is a abandoned railroad line used for walking, bicycling, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing. Two organizations have been established to protect the watershed around the upper and lower stretches of the Sugar River.

He flew aboard four Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and 1990s. Personal data Born May 20, 1944, in Columbus, Georgia. He was a Boy Scout and earned its highest rank of Eagle Scout. Died on April 23, 2001 from cancer, Walker was 56 years old and was being treated at University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. His wife, the former Paige Lucas, and two adult sons from a previous marriage, Michael and Mathieson, survive him. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on May 24, 2001. Education *1962: Graduated from Eustis High School, Eustis, Florida *1966: Received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy Military career Grave at Arlington National Cemetery Walker graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland and subsequently received flight training from the Naval Air Training Command at bases in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas. He was designated a Naval Aviator in December 1967 and proceeded to Naval Air Station Miramar, California, for assignment to F-4 Phantoms aboard the aircraft carriers USS Enterprise and USS America. From December 1970 to 1971, he attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and was subsequently assigned in January 1972 as an experimental and engineering test pilot in the flight test division at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. While there, he participated in the Navy's preliminary evaluation and Board of Inspection and Survey trials of the F-14 Tomcat and tested a leading edge slat modification to the F-4 Phantom. He then attended the United States Navy Safety Officer School at Monterey, California, and completed replacement pilot training in the F-14 Tomcat at NAS Miramar, California. In 1975, Walker was assigned to Fighter Squadron 142 (VF-142), stationed at NAS Oceana, Virginia, as a fighter pilot and was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea twice aboard the USS America. He logged more than 7,500 hours flying time, with over 6,500 hours in jet aircraft. NASA career One of 35 candidates selected by NASA in January 1978 for the new Space Shuttle program, Walker became an astronaut in August 1979. Among his technical assignments, he served as Astronaut Office Safety Officer; technical assistant to the Director of Flight Crew Operations in 1981; a chase pilot on STS-1; software verification at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); mission support group leader for STS-5 and STS-6; Assistant to the Director, Flight Crew Operations; leader of the astronaut support team at Kennedy Space Center in 1985; Branch Chief, Space Station Design and Development; and Special Manager for Assembly, Space Station Project Office. From July 1993 to June 1994, Walker was Chief of the Station/Exploration Support Office, Flight Crew Operations Directorate, after which he chaired the JSC Safety Review Board. A veteran of four spaceflights, Walker logged nearly 725 hours in space. He was the Pilot on STS-51-A in 1984, and was the Commander of STS-30 in 1989, STS-53 in 1992 and STS-69 in 1995. Walker was in training to command STS-61-G, scheduled for a May 1986 launch when the Challenger disaster forced NASA to suspend all Shuttle flights. In 1989, while piloting a NASA T-38 Talon to Washington, D.C. for ceremonies honoring the crew of STS-30, Walker came within 100 ft (30 m) of striking a Pan Am jetliner. That encounter and other infractions of NASA flying rules caused him to be grounded from July to September 1990, costing him the command of STS-44.William Harwood: STS-133 Shuttle Report - Injured astronaut replaced on shuttle Discovery's crew, Spaceflight Now, 19 January 2011Shuttle astronaut taken off crew for ISS mission by Miles O'Brien, CNN (Sep 8, 1999) Spaceflights STS-51-A Discovery (November 8–16, 1984) was launched from and returned to land at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the mission the crew deployed two satellites, Canada's Anik D-2 (Telesat H), and Hughes' LEASAT-1 (Syncom IV-1). In the first space salvage mission in history, the crew also retrieved for return to Earth the Palapa B-2 and Westar VI satellites. Mission duration was 127 Earth orbits in 7 days, 23 hours, 44 minutes, 56 seconds. STS-30 Atlantis (May 4–8, 1989) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the 4-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Magellan Venus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle. Magellan arrived at Venus in August 1990, and mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus. In addition, the crew also worked on secondary payloads involving fluid research in general, chemistry, and electrical storm studies. Following 64 orbits of the Earth, the STS-30 mission concluded with the first cross-wind landing test of the Shuttle Orbiter at Edwards Air Force Base, California. STS-53 Discovery (December 2–9, 1992) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and also returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During 115 Earth orbits, the five-man crew deployed a classified Department of Defense payload DOD-1 and then performed several Military-Man-in-Space and NASA experiments. Mission duration was 175 hours, 19 minutes, 17 seconds. STS-69 Endeavour (September 7–18, 1995) was launched from and returned to land at Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

The party followed a Maoist political program and was part of the broader New Left movement. For several years it published a weekly newspaper, The Forge (La Forge). The party was strongest in Quebec, but alienated many of Quebec's young progressives because it declined to support independence for Quebec, although it did support Quebec's right to self-determination. The most prominent former member of the Workers' Communist Party is Gilles Duceppe, former leader of the Bloc Québécois and former Leader of the Official Opposition in the House of Commons of Canada. Duceppe called his membership \\"a mistake\\" based on a search for \\"absolute answers\\" during his youth. Judy Darcy was active in the party before joining the New Democratic Party. She later became a trade union leader and a cabinet minister in British Columbia. The Workers' Communist Party nominated 30 candidates in the 1980 Canadian federal election and 33 in the 1981 Quebec general election; the party achieved its best result in the latter, receiving 4,956 votes, or 0.14% of the provincial total.

Born in St. Petersburg where his English father was a successful businessman, he studied in Russia, England and Germany, before beginning his career as a conductor in a series of German opera houses. He was a success in England conducting Wagner at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1914, and in 1919 was appointed chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. His strengths as a conductor lay in opera and the Russian repertory, but was very unjustifiably not thought as impressive in the core Austro-German symphonic repertory despite powerful, incisive renditions of Beethoven's Ninth in 1923 on late acoustic 78s, and of Mozart's \\"Jupiter\\" a few years later on very early electrical 78s. After 1923 he failed to secure a permanent conductorship in the UK despite richly deserving of that honor, and for much of the rest of his life guest-conducted in continental Europe and the U.S. In his last years he conducted in South Africa, where he died at 71. As a composer, Coates is little remembered, but he composed seven operas, one of which was performed at Covent Garden. He also wrote some concert works for orchestral forces. Early years Coates was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, the youngest of seven sons of a Yorkshire father, Charles Thomas Coates,Holden, Raymond, \\"Coates, Albert Henry (1882–1953)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 27 February 2011 who managed the Russian branch of an English company, and Mary Ann Gibson, who was born and raised in Russia to British parents. He learned the violin, cello and piano as a child in Russia, and was raised in England after turning twelve. After attending the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, he studied science at Liverpool University.Kennedy, Michael, \\"Coates, Albert,\\" Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 27 February 2011 Liner notes to EMI CD CZS 5 75486 2 (Albert Coates: Great Conductors of the Twentieth Century series), EMI 2002 Coates returned to Russia to join his father's company, but he also studied composition with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In 1902, he entered the Leipzig Conservatory, to study the cello with Julius Klengel and the piano with Robert Teichmüller, but was drawn to conducting in Artur Nikisch's conducting classes. Nikisch appointed Coates répétiteur at the Leipzig opera, and he made his debut as a conductor in 1904 with Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann. He was engaged as the conductor of the Elberfeld opera house in 1906, in succession to Fritz Cassirer. From there he progressed to the post of assistant conductor at the Semperoper, Dresden (1907–08), under Ernst von Schuch and Mannheim in 1909 under Artur Bodanzky. He made his London debut in May 1910, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in a program consisting of a symphony by Maximilian Steinberg, Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto and Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. The Times judged him \\"sound and artistic\\", though \\"not particularly inspiring to watch.\\"\\"Music\\", The Times, 27 May 1910, p. 10 In the same year, he was invited by Eduard Nápravník to conduct in St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre. Coates's conducting of Siegfried at the Mariinsky led to his appointment as principal conductor of the Russian Imperial Opera, a post he held for five years, during which he became associated with leading Russian musicians, including Alexander Scriabin, for whose music he became a strong advocate.Obituary, The Times, 12 December 1953, p. 9 In July 1910, he married Ella Lizzie Holland. International career Coates first appeared at Covent Garden in 1914 in a Wagner season. He won critical praise for his performance of Tristan und Isolde\\"Tristan und Isolde\\", The Times 20 February 1914, p. 8 and particularly for his conducting of Die Meistersinger.\\"Die Meistersinger\\", The Times, 23 February 1914, p. 10 His conducting of Puccini's Manon Lescaut later in the same season was also well received,\\"Manon Lescaut at Covent Garden\\", The Times, 25 April 1914, p. 6 his Parsifal less so.\\"Parsifal at Covent Garden\\", The Times, 24 April 1914, p. 7 The Russian Revolution in 1917 did not at first adversely affect Coates. The Soviet government appointed him \\"President of all Opera Houses in Soviet Russia\\", based in Moscow. By 1919, however, living conditions in Russia had become desperate. Coates became seriously ill, and with considerable difficulty left Russia with his family by way of Finland in April 1919.\\"Albert Coates\\", Naxos Records, accessed 27 February 2011 After his arrival in England, he was appointed chief conductor of the LSO. Reviewing his first performance in the post, The Times praised him warmly, along with the younger Adrian Boult and Geoffrey Toye, in an article on \\"The Conductor's Art\\".\\"The Conductor's Art\\", The Times, 30 April 1919, p. 15 In September 1919, he was appointed to teach a new class for operatic training at the Royal College of Music. Reporting the appointment, The Times wrote, \\"There can scarcely be a musician in this country with so wide and cosmopolitan an experience of operatic performance.\\"\\"Mr. Albert Coates's New Post\\", The Times, 18 September 1919, p. 8 The following month, there occurred an incident for which Coates is remembered in many books and articles. The LSO gave the world premiere of Elgar's Cello Concerto under the baton of the composer, but Coates, who was conducting the rest of the programme, appropriated most of Elgar's allotted rehearsal time. As a result, the orchestra gave a notoriously inadequate performance. Elgar did not complain publicly, but the musical world knew privately of Coates's behaviour. With this exception, Coates served English composers well in the post-war years, giving the first performances of large-scale works including Vaughan Williams's revised A London Symphony (1920),\\"This Week's Music\\", The Times, 6 December 1920, p. 10 Delius's Requiem (1922),\\"Royal Philharmonic Society, Delius's Requiem\\", The Times, 24 March 1922, p. 10; and \\"The New 'Requiem' by Frederic [sic] Delius\\", The Manchester Guardian, 23 March 1922, p. 8. Bax's First Symphony (1922), and Holst's Choral Symphony (1925).\\"Two Choral Composers – Holst and Vaughan Williams\\", The Times, 17 October 1925, p. 10 He conducted many other early performances of music by contemporary English composers, including the second complete performance of Holst's The Planets in 1920, two years after its premiere. Among works from continental Europe introduced to England by Coates were Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto and Rachmaninoff's Fourth Piano Concerto, each with its composer as soloist. In January 1926, he gave the first stage performance outside Russia of Rimsky-Korsakov's opera The Invisible City of Kitezh, at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona. After his contract with the LSO expired in 1922, Coates held no more permanent conductorships in the UK, although he directed the Leeds music festivals of 1922 and 1925. In 1923, he was appointed joint principal conductor with Eugene Goossens of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra in the US. He was among the co-founders of Vladimir Rosing's pioneering American Opera Company.Eaton, Quaintance, \\"Advance Guard\\", Opera News, 27 February 1971, pp. 28–30 Coates left Rochester in 1925 as a result of a disagreement with the orchestra's sponsor, George Eastman, over artistic policy.\\"Mr. Albert Coates\\", The Times, 13 April 1925, p. 9 The reason for his failure to secure a permanent position in the UK was, according to one commentator, that although he was a fine conductor of opera and of Russian concert music, \\"his interpretations of the Viennese classics were less acceptable\\" and as the latter were more important in British musical life, \\"Coates failed to win for himself the highest reputation among his own countrymen.\\" Later years In 1925, Coates was invited to Paris to conduct at the Opéra. He continued to make regular guest appearances in many of the world's artistic centres until 1939. He conducted opera in Italy (1927 to 1929) and Germany (Berlin State Opera, 1931), and concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (1935) and in the Netherlands, Sweden and the USSR, which he visited three times. On 13 November 1936 the BBC broadcast the world's first televised opera: scenes from Coates's Pickwick, directed by Rosing, were shown in advance of the work's premiere. Coates and Rosing launched a season of the British Music Drama Opera Company at Covent Garden the following week.\\"Opera in English – New Company for Covent Garden\\", The Times, 18 July 1936, p. 10 In 1938 he conducted George Lloyd's opera 'The Serf' at Covent Garden with The New English Opera Company, directed by Rosing. When World War II broke out, Coates moved to the US. There, together with Rosing, he founded the Southern California Opera Association. Productions included Coates's opera Gainsborough's Duchess. He guest conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic and worked briefly in Hollywood, making cameo appearances in two 1944 MGM films, Two Girls and a Sailor and Song of Russia. In 1946, Coates moved to South Africa, accepting the conductorships of the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra and, later, the Cape Town Municipal Orchestra. He settled in Milnerton, Cape Town, with his second wife Vera Joanna Nettlefold (a soprano professionally known as Vera de Villiers), and died there in 1953. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says of him \\"Although he was important to the fortunes of the London Symphony Orchestra immediately after the First World War, his contribution to British musical life was ephemeral. As a composer he has lost his place in the repertory, and as an executant he is remembered generally by collectors with an interest in historic recordings.\\" Compositions In its obituary of Coates, The Times wrote that his compositions \\"fell between the two stools of national character and international sympathy, with a resulting ambiguity of achievement.\\" The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians describes them as \\"technically proficient rather than imaginative\\". His works include the operas Samuel Pepys and Pickwick; the former was given in German in Munich in 1929, and the latter in English at Covent Garden in 1936. His five other operas included The Myth Beautiful (1920).\\"Mr. A. Coates's New Opera\\", The Times, 23 October 1920, p. 6 His concert works included a piano concerto and a symphonic poem The Eagle, dedicated to the memory of his former teacher Nikisch, which was performed in Leeds in 1925. At a memorial concert held at the Wigmore Hall on 1 July 1959 the Piano Concerto was performed by the Anglo-French pianist Frank Laffitte with a section of the London Symphony Orchestra. The Guardian critic described it as \\"an endless patchwork of remnants from all the music that Coates ever conducted.\\"'Albert Coates as composer' in The Guardian, 2 July 1959, p 5 Recordings Coates made important early contributions to the representation of orchestral music on record, beginning in 1920 with Scriabin's The Poem of Ecstasy and afterwards conducting many excerpts from Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen and (in 1923 and 1926) two complete recordings of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He conducted the 1929 first recording of Bach's Mass in B minor, BWV 232, and the 1930 premiere recording of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor, with Vladimir Horowitz as soloist.Vladimir Horowitz: Recordings 1930-1951, Warner Classics, 2014.

However, because it was not a registered political party under the rules of Elections Canada, its candidates were considered to be independents. The NALP was the Canadian affiliate of the Lyndon LaRouche movement, and later became the Party for the Commonwealth of Canada/Party for the Commonwealth-Republic. The North American Labour Party nominated candidates in two provincial elections in British Columbia. In the 11 December 1975 election, the party’s four candidates collected 141 votes, less than 0.01% of the popular vote. In the 26 April 1979 elections, its four candidates collected 297 votes, 0.02% of the popular vote. The party also ran candidates in the 1975 and 1977 provincial elections in the province of Ontario. The party was not registered in 1977, and its six candidates appeared on the ballot as independents. NALP candidates also ran in Toronto and Montreal municipal elections of 1978. The NALP did not have an official leader in Ontario during the 1977 election, although Joe Brewda appears to have been the party's spokesman. In an interview with the Toronto Star, published on June 6, 1977, Brewda argued that his party was rooted in socialism but encompassed other viewpoints as well. He is quoted as saying, \\"our program is based on economic growth and represents the vital interests of conservative industrialists, workers and some scientific layers\\". He also argued in support of a gold-backed monetary system, and alleged that his party would have received 15% of the vote in the previous election had it not been for massive voter fraud. An article from The Globe and Mail of January 2, 1980 lists Richard Sanders as the main Toronto organizer of the NALP, and accuses the party of anti-Semitism. Sanders is cited in this article as alleging massive voter fraud against his party. During the 1978 mayoral contest, Sanders was quoted as making the following statements: \\"The trouble with Toronto, is its porno press, the Sun, Star and Globe and Mail!

This junction functions like a synapse. However, unlike most neurons, somatic efferent motor neurons innervate skeletal muscle, and are always excitatory. Visceral efferent neurons innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands, and have the ability to be either excitatory or inhibitory in function. Neuroeffector junctions are known as neuromuscular junctions when the target cell is a muscle fiber. Non-synaptic transmission is characteristic of autonomic neuroeffector junctions. The structure of the autonomic neuromuscular junction consists of several essential features including that: the terminal portions of autonomic nerve fibers are varicose and mobile, transmitters being released ‘en passage’ from varying distances from the effector cells; while there is no structural post-junctional specialization on effector cells, receptors for neurotransmitters accumulate on cell membranes at close junctions. Muscle effectors are bundles rather than single smooth muscle cells that are connected by gap junctions which allow electrotonic spread of activity between cells. A multiplicity of transmitters are utilized by autonomic nerves, and co-transmission occurs often involving synergistic actions of the co- transmitters, although pre- and post-junctional neuromodulation of neurotransmitter release also take place. It is suggested that autonomic neural control of immune, epithelial and endothelial cells also involves non- synaptic transmission. These are tight junctions, but in the autonomic nervous system and enteric nervous system the connecting junctions become much “looser”, allowing for easier diffusion. This looseness allows for a wider signal receiving whereas in tighter junctions, more neurotransmitters get metabolized or broken down. In skeletal muscles, the junctions are mostly of the same distance and size because they innervate such definite structures of muscle fibers. In the Autonomic Nervous System however, these neuromuscular junctions are much less well defined. Analysis of non-noradrenergic/non- cholinergic (NANC) transmission at single varicosities or swellings indicates that individual synapses possess different probabilities for the secretion of transmitter as well as different complements of autoreceptors and mixtures of post-junctional receptor subunits. There is then a local determination of the quantitative properties of single synapses. Nerve terminals are the terminal part of the axon filled with neurotransmitters and are the location from which neurotransmitters are released. Nerve terminals may take different forms in different tissues. Nerve terminals appear like a button in the CNS, end plates in striated muscle and varicosities in many tissues including the gut. Buttons, endplates or varicosities all function to store and release neurotransmitters. In many peripheral tissues, the varicose axon branches in its proximal course and carries a covering of Schwann sheath, which is interrupted and finally lost in its most terminal part. The unmyelinated, preterminal axons with very long varicose branches are present in small axon bundles and varicose terminal axons are present as single isolated axons. The small axon bundles run parallel to and between muscle bundles and the “en passage” varicose axons are the main sources of innervations to the gut smooth muscle bundles. Nonsynaptic post-junctional receptors are mostly G-protein coupled metabotropic receptors that produce a slower response. They include metabotropic receptors for the classical neurotransmitters, monoamines, norepinephrine, purines and peptide transmitters. Post-junctional receptors also include some ionotropic receptors such as nicotinic receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Nonsynaptic junctional transmission is the only mode of transmission involving the varicosities that show no synaptic contacts that includes almost all nerve terminals whose target is not a neuron. Most smooth muscles exhibit both fast and slow junction potentials typically mediated by different classes of metabotropic receptors with different kinetics. The close junctional neurotransmission is characterized by synapse like close contact between the pre-junctional release site and the post-junctional receptors. However, unlike the synapse, the junctional space is open to the extravascular space; the pre- junctional release site lacks the distinguishing features of the presynaptic active zone and release of the soluble transmitters; and the post junctional receptors include metabotropic receptors or slower acting ionotropic receptors. Almost all tissues that exhibit close junctional neurotransmission also show wide junctional neurotransmission. Thus, wide junctional transmission has been described in many smooth muscles such as vas deferens, urinary bladder, blood vessels, gut as well as the nervous systems including ENS, autonomic ganglia and the CNS. Control of gastrointestinal (GI) movements by enteric motoneurons is critical for orderly processing of food, absorption of nutrients and elimination of wastes. Neuroeffector junctions in the tunica muscularis might consist of synaptic-like connectivity with specialized cells, and contributions from multiple cell types in integrated post-junctional responses. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) – non-muscular cells of mesenchymal origin—were proposed as potential mediators in motor neurotransmission. Neuromuscular junctions in GI smooth muscles may reflect innervation of, and post-junctional responses in, all three classes of post- junctional cells. Transduction of neurotransmitter signals by ICC cells and activation of ionic conductances would be conducted electronically via gap junctions to surrounding smooth muscle cells and influence the excitability of tissues. Neuromuscular junction. 1. Axon innervating muscle fibers; 2. Junction between axon and muscle fiber; 3. Muscle; 4. Muscle fiber  Discovery  In the peripheral nervous system, local junctional transmission was recognized in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Until then, all chemical neurotransmission was thought to involve synapses and the innervations of tissue were considered synonymous with the existence of a synapse. Later, it was observed that at smooth muscle neuromuscular junctions in the gut and other peripheral autonomic neuroeffector junctions, neurotransmission takes place in the absence of any synapses and it was suggested that at these sites, neurotransmission involved non-synaptic transmission. Accordingly, nerve endings release their neurotransmitters in extracellular space in a manner similar to paracrine secretion. Target cells affected by a locally released transmitter even though located several hundreds to thousands of nanometers away from the release site are considered as being innervated. The varicose axons were first visualized for adrenergic terminals using fluorescence histochemistry described by Falck and colleagues. These varicose axons resemble strings of beads with varicosities 0.5–2.0 μ in diameter and 1 to 3 μ in length and separated by inter-varicosity axon 0.1 to 0.2 μ in diameter. The varicosities occur at 2–10 μm intervals and it has been estimated that a single adrenergic axon may have over 25,000 varicosities on its terminal part. There are also two types of contacts. These contacts are called large and small contacts, respectively. In the large contacts, the bare varicosities and the smooth muscles were separated by ~60 nm and in the small contacts the two were separated by ~400 nm. Overall, non-synaptic junctional space between the neural release site and the post-junctional receptors may show variable degrees of separation between the release site on the pre-junctional nerve terminal and the post-junctional receptors on the target cell. The discovery of NANC inhibitory and excitatory transmission as well as the fact that such transmission has to be considered as occurring to smooth muscle cells coupled together in an electrical Autonomic postganglionic nerves terminate in systems syncytium and that the excitatory NANC transmission of collateral branches, each of which possesses of the order gives rise to a calcium-dependent action potential.  Research  Neuromuscular junctions in gastrointestinal (GI) smooth muscles may reflect innervation of, and post-junctional responses in, all three classes of post-junctional cells. Transduction of neurotransmitter signals by ICC cells and activation of ionic conductances would be conducted electronically via gap junctions to surrounding smooth muscle cells and influence excitability. Studies do not exclude the possibility of parallel excitatory neurotransmission to ICC-DMP (deep muscular plexus) and smooth muscle cells. Different cells may utilize different receptors and signaling molecules. ICC are innervated and transmitters reach high enough concentration to activate post-junctional signaling pathways in ICC. If ICC are important intermediaries in motor neurotransmission, then loss of these cells could reduce communication between the enteric nervous system and the smooth muscle syncytium, resulting in reduced neural regulation of motility. In pioneering studies it was shown unequivocally that the innervation of smooth muscles is by varicose nerve terminals. However, it was not until the advent of the electron microscope that we were able to provide us with a comprehensive view of the relationship between these varicose endings and smooth muscle. Besides activation of K+ channels by NO, some authors have suggested that Ca2+-activated Cl− channels, which are active under basal conditions, can be suppressed as part of the post-junctional response to NO. These studies do not exclude the possibility of parallel excitatory neurotransmission to ICC-DMP and smooth muscle cells. Different cells may utilize different receptors and signaling molecules. These findings make the point that ICC are innervated and transmitters reach high enough concentration to activate post-junctional signaling pathways in ICC. There is no reason to assume a priori that responses to neurotransmitters released from neurons and exogenous transmitter substances are mediated by the same cells, receptors or post-junctional (transduction) signaling pathways. Neurotransmitters released from varicosities may be spatially limited to specific populations of receptors, whereas transmitters added to organ baths may bind to receptors on a variety of cells. Structure and Function Non-synaptic transmission is characteristic of autonomic neuroeffector junctions. The essential features are that: the terminal portions of autonomic nerve fibers are varicose and mobile; transmitters are released from varicosities at varying distances from the effector cells; and while there is no structural post-junctional specialization on effector cells, receptors for neurotransmitters accumulate on cell membranes at close junctions. Besides smooth muscle, autonomic neural control of immune, epithelial, and endothelial cells also involves nonsynaptic transmission. Smooth muscle effectors are bundles rather than single cells, that are connected by gap junctions which allow electrotonic spread of activity between cells. Many smooth muscle cells in a transverse section through a muscle bundle show regions of very close apposition to adjacent cells at which connexins form junctions between the cells. Unlike in cardiac muscle, where gap junctions are confined to the ends of cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle gap junctions occur along the length of the muscle cells as well as towards their ends. There are small bundles of three to seven varicose axons, partially or wholly enveloped in Schwann-cell sheath, both on the surface of the muscle as well as in the body of smooth muscle bundles. In addition, single varicose axons can be found on the surface and in the muscle bundles, and become divested of Schwann cells in the region of apposition between the varicosities and smooth muscle cells. The active zone of individual sympathetic varicosities, delineated by a high concentration of syntaxin, occupies an area on the pre-junctional membrane of about 0.2 μm2; this gives a junctional gap between the pre-junctional active zone and post- junctional membranes that varies between about 50 and 100 nm. The post- junctional membrane beneath the varicosity can possess a patch about 1 μm2 of purinergic P2X1 receptors in high density, although this is not always the case. A nerve impulse gives rise to a transient increase in calcium concentration in every varicosity, primarily due to the opening of N-type calcium channels, as well as to a smaller increase in the intervaricose regions. The probability of secretion from a varicosity may depend on the number of secretosomes that the varicosity possesses, where a secretosome is a complex of syntaxin, synaptotagmin, an N-type calcium channel, and a synaptic vesicle. A multiplicity of transmitters are utilized by autonomic nerves, and cotransmission occurs, often involving synergistic actions of the cotransmitters, although pre- and post-junctional neuromodulation of neurotransmitter release also take place. Cotransmission without co-storage occurs in parasympathetic nerves, where terminals staining for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter can also contain nitric oxide synthase, suggesting that they release NO as a gaseous neurotransmitter. Neuroeffector Ca2+ transients (NCT) have been used to detect the packeted release of the neurotransmitter ATP acting on post-junctional P2X receptors to cause the Ca2+ influx. ATP released from varicosities is modulated by the concomitant release of noradrenaline that acts on the varicosities through α2-adrenoceptors to decrease the influx of calcium ions that accompanies the nerve impulse. NCT can also be used to detect the local effects of noradrenaline through its α2-adrenoceptor-mediated pre-junctional autoinhibitory effects on nerve terminal Ca2+ concentration and the probability of exocytosis (measured by counting NCTs). There is evidence that exocytosis from sympathetic varicosities depends on their history, and that the release of a packet of ATP transiently suppresses (or predicts the transient suppression of) subsequent release. The poverty of NCTs occurring within 5s of one another indicates that exocytosis from a varicosity transiently suppresses the probability of release from that varicosity. This could arise by autoinhibition (by the pre- junctional action of noradrenaline or purines) or due to a transient shortage of vesicles readily available for release. ATP release (hence noradrenaline release, if there is strict corelease) is highly intermittent at these junctions (Brain et al. 2002), with a probability that a given action potential will evoke the release from a given varicosity of only 0.019. If there are n varicosities within the diffusion range of a particular varicosity, we can consider the number of such varicosities that might need to be present in order that, on average (using P =0.5 to give the median value), neurotransmitter will be released locally. During a five-impulse train, assuming that the last impulse in the train cannot autoinhibit the Ca2+ influx during the train, the expectation value of n can be found by solving [(1 − 0.019)4n] =(1 − 0.5), i.e. the probability that there will be no local release, given n varicosities within the diffusion range. This is n = [ln(0.5)/ln(0.981)]/4, or n≈9. If the density of varicosities is around 2.2 per 1000 μm3, this number of varicosities should occur within an average range (radius) of about 10 μm (noting that within such a radius there is a tissue volume of about 4200 μm3). Therefore, even in the presence of highly intermittent noradrenaline release, one would expect the average varicosity in this organ to be within 10 μm of a released packet of noradrenaline at some time during a five-impulse stimulus train (excluding the last impulse). Junctional transmission is measured in seconds to minutes. The time course of the junctional potential has been divided into two most frequently observed time courses representing ‘close’ and ‘wide’ junctional transmissions. The “close” junctional transmission is associated with fast junction potential and the “wide” junctional transmission is associated with slow junction potential. The slow electrical potentials reach a peak in about 150 ms and then decline with a time constant between 250 and 500 ms. These responses typically last several seconds to minutes and may be depolarizing and excitatory, or hyperpolarizing and inhibitory, and have been called slow EJP or slow IJP, respectively.  Interstitial cells of Cajal  Over the past 20 years, many studies have given evidence that Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC): (i) serve as pacemaker cells with unique ionic currents that generate electrical slow waves in GI muscles; (ii) provide a pathway for active slow wave propagation in GI organs; (iii) express receptors, transduction mechanisms and ionic conductances allowing them to mediate post-junctional responses to enteric motor neurotransmission; (iv) regulate smooth muscle excitability by contributing to resting potential and affecting syncytial conductance; and (v) manifest stretch-receptor functions regulating excitability and regulating slow wave frequency. If this channel is open, conductance changes in cell are reflected in smooth muscle; post-junctional integrated responses are triggered by neuroeffector junctions and interstitial cells. Based on anatomic location and function, two main types of ICC have been described: myenteric ICC (ICC- MY) and intramuscular ICC (ICC-IM). ICC-MY are present around the myenteric plexus and thought to be pacemaker cells for slow waves in the smooth muscle cells. Calcium imaging studies in the colon have shown that ICC-MY is innervated by nitrergic and cholinergic nerve terminals, though the nature of the contacts has not been well defined. ICC-IM is located in between the smooth muscle cells. Enteric nerves have been reported to make synaptic contacts with ICC-IM. These contacts include areas of electron dense lining on the inner aspect of the varicosity membrane without any postsynaptic density on the membrane of ICC. Such contacts were not reported between the nerves and the smooth muscles. If ICC are important intermediaries in motor neurotransmission, then loss of these cells could reduce communication between the enteric nervous system and the smooth muscle syncytium, resulting in reduced neural regulation of motility. Classical excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters are concentrated and released from neurovesicles located in enteric nerve terminals or varicose regions of motor nerves, whereas nitric oxide is probably synthesized de novo as calcium concentration increases in nerve terminals upon membrane depolarization. Enteric nerve terminals make intimate synapses with ICC-IM, which are situated between the nerve terminals and neighbouring smooth muscle cells. ICC-IM play a critical role in the reception and transduction of cholinergic excitatory and nitrergic inhibitory neurotransmission. ICC-IM form gap junctions with smooth muscle cells and post-junctional electrical responses generated in ICC are conducted to the smooth muscle syncytium. By this contact, ICC can regulate the neuromuscular responses observed throughout the GI tract. Recent morphological evidence using anterograde tracing methods, has shown close apposition between vagal and spinal afferents and ICC-IM within the stomach wall (Fig. 5) and their absence in mutant animals that lack ICC-IM also supports a role for ICC-IM as possible integrators for in-series stretch-dependent changes in this organ.

Greene's novel tells the story of a renegade Roman Catholic 'whisky priest' (a term coined by Greene) living in the Mexican state of Tabasco in the 1930s, a time when the Mexican government was attempting to suppress the Catholic Church. That suppression had resulted in the Cristero War (1927-1929), so named for its Catholic combatants' slogan Viva Cristo Rey (long live Christ the King). In 1941, the novel received the Hawthornden Prize British literary award. In 2005, it was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the hundred best English-language novels since 1923.\\"All Time 100 Novels\\". Time. 2005. Plot The main character is an unnamed 'whisky priest', who combines a great power for self-destruction with pitiful cravenness, an almost painful penitence, and a desperate quest for dignity. By the end, though, the priest \\"acquires a real holiness.\\"H.J.Donaghy, Graham Greene, p.40 The other principal character is a police lieutenant tasked with hunting down this priest. This Lieutenant – also unnamed but thought to be based upon Tomás Garrido CanabalThe Power and the Glory New York: Viking, 1990. Introduction by John Updike. – is a committed socialist who despises the Church. The overall situation is this: Catholicism is outlawed in Mexico. However, while the other states of Mexico seem to follow a Don't-ask-don't-tell policy, the state of Tabasco enforces the ban rigorously. Mexico, or at least Tabasco, is ruled on socialist grounds, and priests have either been settled by the state with wives (breaking celibacy) and pensions in exchange for their renouncing the faith and being strictly banned from fulfilling priestly functions (such as one Padre José), or else have left the state or are on the run,or have been shot. The story starts with the arrival of the main character in a small country town and then follows him on his trip through Tabasco, where he tries to minister to the people as best he can. In doing so, he is faced by a lot of problems, not least of which is that Tabasco is also prohibitionist, with the unspoken prime objective to hinder celebration of the Sacrifice of the Mass, for which actual wine is an essential. (It is, therefore, quite easy to get, say, whiskey, despite it being forbidden, but very difficult to get wine.) He is also haunted by his personal problems and past and present sins, especially by the fact that he fathered a child in his parish some years before; additionally, his use of whiskey may be bordering on addiction and certainly is beyond the limit of good measure in his own view. (In one scene, both of these problems are mixed: the protagonist tries to procure a bottle of wine for Holy Mass, needing to go to very high officials to do so, with an additional bottle of whiskey for cover and also for his personal use; not being able to reveal himself, he is talked into emptying the wine on the spot and in vain tries to offer the whiskey instead.) As for his daughter, he meets her, but is unable to feel repentant about what happened. Rather, he feels a deep love for the evil-looking and awkward little girl and decides to do everything in his power to save her from damnation. During his journey the priest also encounters a mestizo who later reveals himself to be a Judas figure. The chief antagonist, however, is the lieutenant, who is morally irreproachable, yet cold and inhumane. While he is supposedly \\"living for the people\\", he puts into practice a diabolic plan of taking hostages from villages and shooting them, if it proves that the priest has sojourned in a village but is not denounced. The lieutenant has also had bad experiences with the church in his youth, and as a result there is a personal element in his search for the whisky priest. The lieutenant thinks that all members of the clergy are fundamentally evil, and believes that the church is corrupt, and does nothing but provide delusion to the people. In his flight from the lieutenant and his posse, the priest escapes into a neighbouring province, only to re-connect with the mestizo, who persuades the priest to return to hear the confession of a dying man. Though the priest suspects that it is a trap, he feels compelled to fulfil his priestly duty. Although he finds the dying man, it is a trap and the lieutenant captures the priest. The lieutenant admits he has nothing against the priest as a man, but he must be shot \\"as a danger\\". On the eve of the execution, the lieutenant shows mercy and attempts to enlist Padre José to hear the condemned man's confession (which in extremis the Church would allow, and which the protagonist has agreed to), but the effort is thwarted by Padre José's wife. The lieutenant is convinced that he has \\"cleared the province of priests\\". In the final scene, however, another priest arrives in the town. One faithful Catholic woman we had previously encountered telling lives of the saints in the underground has added the life of the protagonist to her repertoire, while forbidding her son to ever remember that this priest smelled strangely out of his mouth. This, among other possible readings, suggests that the Catholic Church cannot be destroyed. On a lighter level, it also suggests that a certain type of devotee will ever try to smooth down rough-edged saints into Fairchild family-like picturebook heroes, even if it stands in the way of properly celebrating their very real faith and heroism. Composition Greene visited Mexico from January to May 1938 to research and write a nonfiction account of the persecution of the Catholic Church in Mexico, that he had been planning since 1936.Brennan, Michael. Graham Greene: Fictions, Faith and Authorship (London: Continuum, 2010), pp. 47, 56–59. The persecution of the Catholic Church was especially severe in the province of Tabasco, under anti-clerical governor Tomás Garrido Canabal.Needler, Martin C. Mexican Politics: The Containment of Conflict: Politics in Latin America (NY: Praeger, 1982), p. ?? His campaign succeeded in closing all the churches in the state. It forced the priests to marry and give up their soutanes. Greene called it the \\"fiercest persecution of religion anywhere since the reign of Elizabeth.\\"Graham Greene, The Lawless Roads, page ?? He chronicled his travels in Tabasco in The Lawless Roads, published in 1939. In that generally hostile account of his visit he wrote \\"That, I think, was the day I began to hate the Mexicans\\" and at another point described his \\"growing depression, almost pathological hatred ... for Mexico.\\" Pico Iyer has marveled at how Greene's responses to what he saw could be \\"so dyspeptic, so loveless, so savagely self-enclosed and blind\\" in his nonfiction treatment of his journey, though, as another critic has noted, \\"nowhere in The Power and the Glory is there any indication of the testiness and revulsion\\" in Greene's nonfiction report. Many details reported in Greene's nonfiction treatment of his Tabasco trip appeared in the novel, from the sound of a revolver in the police chief's holster to the vultures in the sky. The principal characters of The Power and the Glory all have antecedents in The Lawless Roads, mostly as people Greene encountered directly or, in the most important instance, a legendary character that people told him about, a certain \\"whisky priest\\", a fugitive who, as Greene writes in The Lawless Roads, \\"existed for ten years in the forest and swamps, venturing out only at night\\". Another of Greene's inspirations for his main character was the Jesuit priest Miguel Pro, who performed his priestly functions as an underground priest in Tabasco and was executed without trial in 1927 on false charges. In 1983, Greene said that he first started to become a Christian in Tabasco, where the fidelity of the peasants \\"assumed such proportions that I couldn't help being profoundly moved.\\" Despite having visited Mexico and published an account of his travels, in the novel Greene was not meticulous about Tabasco's geography. In The Power and the Glory, he identified the region's northern border as the U.S. and its southern border as the sea, when Tabasco's northern border is actually the Bay of Campeche and its southern border is Chiapas to the south. Characters The Priest: The unnamed main character in the novel, the priest is on the run from the authorities, who will kill him if they catch him. A \\"whisky priest,\\" and not the finest example of his profession, he is an alcoholic who has also fathered a child. In his younger days he was smug and self-satisfied. Now as a fugitive, he feels guilt for his mistakes and sins. Nevertheless, he continues to perform his priestly functions (often in great difficulty and sometimes reluctance) and it is his determination to attend to the spiritual needs of a dying man that leads to his eventual capture and death. The Lieutenant: The lieutenant is the chief adversary of the priest. He hates the church because he thinks it is corrupt, and he pursues the priest ruthlessly. He takes hostages from the villages and kills them when he feels it is necessary. However, the lieutenant is also idealistic, and believes in radical social reform that would end poverty and provide education for everyone. He is capable of acts of personal kindness, as when he gives the priest (whom he believes to be a destitute drunkard) money on leaving the jail. The Mestizo: The mestizo is the half-Indian peasant who insists on guiding the priest to Carmen. The priest knows that the mestizo will at some point hand him over to the authorities. The mestizo encounters the priest again in the prison, but prefers to wait for the right moment to betray him, which he does when leading him to the dying American. Maria: Maria is the mother of Brigitta, the priest’s daughter. She keeps brandy for the priest and helps him evade the police when they come to her village looking for him. Although she shows support when the \\"whisky priest\\" reappears, the narrative leaves the character of Maria incomplete with implications of resentment. Brigitta: The young daughter of Maria and the priest. Padre José: A priest who obeyed the government’s instructions and took a wife. He is dominated by her and has lost both the respect of the town and his self-respect. He refuses to do any priestly duties, even when people beg him to, because he fears the authorities. Mr. Tench: Mr. Tench is a dissatisfied English dentist who longs to return from Mexico to England. He befriends the priest, whom he meets at the quayside, and later witnesses his death. Coral Fellows: The thirteen-year- old daughter of Captain and Mrs. Fellows. She befriends the priest and offers refuge to him for the future. Her fate at the end of the novel is not revealed. Her parents have promised each other not to talk about her again. Captain Fellows: A happy Englishman who works on a banana plantation who is displeased to find that the priest has taken refuge in his barn. Mrs. Fellows: The wife of Captain Fellows. She is neurotic and fearful and hates life in Mexico. The Woman: The unnamed woman reads to her children the story of Juan and his martyrdom. The Catholic faith is important to her and she wants her children to take an interest in it. Luis: This young boy shows little interest in the story his mother reads to him, but his interest is awakened by the news of the priest's death. The Gringo: An American fugitive called James Calver, he is wanted for murder and bank robbery. The Chief of Police: Mostly concerned with playing billiards and assuaging his own toothache, he doesn't share the Lieutenant's idealism and wilfully breaks the law. The Lehrs: Mr. Lehr, a widower, and his sister, Miss Lehr, are an elderly couple who allow the priest to stay with them after he crosses the state border. They are Lutherans, and have little sympathy for Catholicism, although they treat the priest with kindness. Juan: Juan is a character within a story that the unnamed woman reads to her family. Juan is a young Mexican man who enters the priesthood, lives a pious life and faces his death by firing squad with great courage. Adaptations In 1947, the novel was freely adapted into a film, The Fugitive, directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda as the priest. It was faithfully dramatized by Denis Cannan for performance at the Phoenix Theatre in London in 1956, the whisky priest acted by Paul Scofield, and in 1958 at the Phoenix Theatre in New York City.Details given in the Who's Who 2007 article about Denis Cannan The dramatization was The Play of the Week on US television in 1959, with James Donald as the priest.IMDB entry for Play of the Week episode \\"The Power and the Glory\\" A highly acclaimed 1961 US television version, released theatrically overseas, featured Laurence Olivier in the role.Sochurek, Howard (Sept 1961), \\"Power and Glory of Sir Laurence\\", Life, issue 29The Power and the Glory 1961 television movie at IMDB Criticism The Power and the Glory was somewhat controversial and, in 1953, Cardinal Bernard Griffin of Westminster summoned Greene and read him a pastoral letter condemning the novel. According to Greene: > The Archbishop of Westminster read me a letter from the Holy Office > condemning my novel because it was \\"paradoxical\\" and \\"dealt with > extraordinary circumstances.\\" The price of liberty, even within a Church, is > eternal vigilance, but I wonder whether any of the totalitarian states ... > would have treated me as gently when I refused to revise the book on the > casuistical ground that the copyright was in the hands of my publishers. > There was no public condemnation, and the affair was allowed to drop into > that peaceful oblivion which the Church wisely reserves for unimportant > issues. Evelyn Waugh in Greene's defence wrote, \\"It was as fatuous as unjust – a vile misreading of a noble book.\\" Greene said that when he met Pope Paul VI in 1965, he assured Greene, \\"some aspects of your books are certain to offend some Catholics, but you should pay no attention to that.\\"Graham Greene. Paul VI, in 1953, a decade before becoming pope, had defended The Power and the Glory against other churchmen who wanted to censor it. Peter Godman. \\"Graham Greene's Vatican Dossier\\", The Atlantic, July/August 2001. Many novelists consider the novel to be Greene's masterpiece, as John Updike claimed in his introduction to the 1990 reprint of the novel. On its publication, William Golding claimed Greene had \\"captured the conscience of the twentieth century man like no other.\\" Contemporary The Power and the Glory plays a role in the 2017 short film 2048: Nowhere to Run, directed by Luke Scott. In this third of three prequels to Blade Runner 2049, the character Sapper Morton (who is shown to be a replicant later in the film) presents the novel as a gift to Ella, a young friend, exclaiming: > \\"It’s very exciting. It’s about an outlaw priest who’s just trying to > understand the meaning of being human... It’s one of my favourites, you’ll > love it\\".

The Spanish traders of Manila galleons brought it to Asia. The name is also used in Portuguese as ata. The fruit is spherical-conical, in diameter and long, and weighing , with a thick rind composed of knobby segments. The color is typically pale green through blue-green, with a deep pink blush in certain varieties, and typically has a bloom. It is unique among Annona fruits in being segmented, and the segments tend to separate when ripe, exposing the interior. The flesh is fragrant and sweet, creamy white through light yellow, and resembles and tastes like custard. It is found adhering to seeds forming individual segments arranged in a single layer around a conical core. It is soft, slightly grainy, and slippery. The hard, shiny seeds may number 20–40 or more per fruit and have a brown to black coat, although varieties exist that are almost seedless. There are also new varieties being developed in Taiwan. The atemoya or \\"pineapple sugar-apple,\\" a hybrid between the sugar-apple and the cherimoya, is popular in Taiwan, although it was first developed in the US in 1908. The fruit is similar in sweetness to the sugar-apple but has a very different taste. As its name suggests, it tastes like pineapple. Nutrition and uses Sugar-apple is high in energy, an excellent source of vitamin C and manganese, a good source of thiamine and vitamin B6, and provides vitamin B2, B3 B5, B9, iron, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium in fair quantities.

History The preserved facade of the Duluth Normal School. Three extant buildings of this campus are now part of the University of Minnesota Duluth. Early history and plans for Duluth Normal School Although the University of Minnesota Duluth didn’t officially make its appearance until 1947, plans for a college in the Duluth area were first made in the 1890s.Duluth:300 Years, Sieur duLhut Tricentennial Committee, Duluth. 1979. The state legislature planned for a teaching school for women (then referred to as a normal school)http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/normal.html and in 1895 they passed a bill authorizing the State Normal School at Duluth.Zenith: A Postcard Perspective of Historic Duluth. Dierckins, Tony. X-Communication, Duluth, Minnesota. 2006.Duluth: Then and Now, Duluth News Tribune, Duluth. 2005 In 1896, the City of Duluth donated of land to serve as a foundation for the school, and the state legislature provided additional funds for the construction costs for the main building in 1899, which was built in 1900. In February 1901, a fire caused extensive damage to the school and the following year, the school was rebuilt.Duluth’s Legacy Volume 1: Architecture. Scott, James Allen.

BohannonDuluth Sketches of the Past: A Bicentennial Collection. Northprint Co. U.S.A. 1976. was appointed president of the Duluth Normal School. In 1902 the school first opened for enrollment. The first students, all women, came to the school to be trained for a degree in education. By 1903, the first seven women received their diplomas from the State Normal School at Duluth. The institution changed names to the Duluth State Normal School or Duluth Normal School in 1905. In 1906, the first dormitories were opened, costing the school around $35,000 to build. Room and board were offered at cost, between fourteen and fifteen dollars a month. Throughout the next few years, more dormitories, two new wings, and an auditorium were added to the school. Requirements, such as having a high school diploma, were instituted. Students who signed a pledge to teach after graduation attended for free; others were required to pay $30 per year. The 1906 Bulletin of the State Normal School describes the school at that time: :The building is thoroughly modern in construction and equipment. It is located in one of the most attractive parts of the city, overlooking the waters of Lake Superior from a height of more than three hundred feet. The laboratories are large and well arranged. The furniture and apparatus are new and excellent in every way. The present equipment of the several laboratories represents an expenditure of not less than $7,500, and is entirely adequate for the needs of the school. A large and well-lighted room has been equipped for manual training. It is supplied with twenty benches of the most approved make and all of the necessary tools and instruments. Enrollment for 1903 was 127 and by 1906 it had increased to 202.A Chronology of UMD Events, 1895-1984. Hoshal, Julian. Duluth. 1985. A Model School with kindergarten through grade eight was maintained for \\"practice teaching\\". The 1906 bulletin reports, \\"At the opening of the school four years ago it was somewhat doubtful whether the number of children to attend would be sufficient to constitute a model school in any proper sense. Only three teachers were needed to take charge of the pupils at that time, while five are required now and the number of children seeking admission is greatly in excess of the limit fixed for the several grades. In 1921, the State Normal School at Duluth was renamed Duluth State Teachers CollegeImages of America: Duluth, Minnesota. Aubut, Sheldon T. and Norton, Maryanne C., Arcadia Publishing, Chicago, Illinois. 2001. or DSTC. The change in status allowed bachelor's degrees and four-year degree programs to be added to the school. The college published a yearbook, The Chronicle, and looking through the publication the many pages devoted to extracurricular events and student's photos of campus life suggests that the students enjoyed many activities outside of their everyday classroom work. In 1929 the school became co-ed, and the first sports teams were instituted, including hockey, football, and basketball. By 1937, the community supported elevating DSTC to a branch campus of the University of Minnesota. In 1985 the four surviving buildings of the State Normal School at Duluth, consisting of the Main Building, Washburn Hall, Torrance Hall, and the Model School, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With The Duluth State Normal School Historic District was listed for its state-level significance in the themes of architecture and education. It was nominated as Minnesota's most intact state normal school campus, and for the Beaux-Arts architecture of the Main Building. However a fire in 1993 reduced the Main Building to freestanding remnants. Founding of University of Minnesota Duluth As enrollment increased on the University of Minnesota campus in the Twin Cities in the 1940s, higher education leaders began to debate how to address overcrowding on the state's land grant university campus. During this time City leaders and area state legislators formed a plan to advocate for establishing a branch campus of the University of Minnesota in the City of Duluth. After significant lobbying efforts a bill was drafted and submitted to the legislature that would instead take the Duluth State Teachers College, remove it from the Minnesota State Teachers College system and establish a branch of the University of Minnesota in 1947.Landmark Structures of Duluth: Their History and Architecture. Sommer, Lawrence J. 1971. The Legislature narrowly passed the bill and the marriage of the University of Minnesota to Duluth State Teachers College began.The University of Minnesota 1945-2000, Stanford Lehmberg and Ann M. Pflam, University of Minnesota Press, 2001 It is at this time that the University of Minnesota Duluth was established.Duluth: An Illustrated History of the Zenith City. Sandvik, Glenn N. Windsor, Publications, Woodland Hills, California. 1983. These events were significant statewide as the Duluth State Teachers College was given preference above all of the other state teachers college in 6 other regions of the state to be upgraded to \\"university\\" status. These events later led to discord, with Southern Minnesota organizing to request its own university in 1963-1967 as part of efforts to make Mankato State Teachers College into a research university called the University of Southern Minnesota or Minnesota State University. It wouldn't be until 1975-1976 that the others would be allowed to develop comprehensive curriculum and expand as full universities. During these initial years the University of Minnesota Duluth was considered directly a part of the University of Minnesota, not an independent institution. Modern history The University of Minnesota Duluth has established itself in a number of research areas including ocean, sea and freshwater sciences. It is the primary sea-grant university for the state of Minnesota and operates the Minnesota Sea Grant Program offices on campus. In addition, in 1972 a two-year school of medicine was founded at the university to provide the first two years of medical education in a small urban and rural setting. The medical school was reorganized in 2000 to be a direct component of the University of Minnesota Medical School from the Twin Cities campus and now operates semi- independently from the University of Minnesota Duluth. Today, the university now educates a medium sized student body of early 11,000 students each year and draws students primarily from the Twin Ports and Twin Cities areas.

New art on campus came along with the construction of the new buildings. All new public building projects in Minnesota must comply with the state's “One Percent for Art” law, passed by the State Legislature in 1984, which mandates that all such projects in Minnesota costing over $500,000 must devote at least 1% of their total construction budget towards incorporating public art into these building's public spaces. A little over 1% of the library's $28 million construction costs went toward the purchase and installation of a glass sculpture by Dale Chihuly that hangs from the ceiling of the two-story library lobby. An outdoor sculpture adjacent to the Swenson Science Building makes reference to elements of Duluth's surrounding Native American Ojibwe culture. The sculpture, \\"Wild Ricing Moon,\\" was designed by John David MooneyThe Vatican Observatory and the Arts: The Sculpture of John David Mooney at Castel Gandolfo, University of Notre Dame Press. 2000 and represents the traditional wild rice harvest.UMD: sculpture School of Medicine The colleges and schools at the University of Minnesota Duluth are: * College of Education & Human Service Professions * College of Liberal Arts * Labovitz School of Business and Economics * School of Fine Arts * Swenson College of Science and Engineering * Graduate School * Medical SchoolDuluth: An Illustrated History of the Zenith City.

The exterior expresses the traits of a place where students design, construct, and test structures to withstand stresses and strains. The facade is distinguished by cor-ten steel, precast and poured in place concrete, concrete block, and scuppers clad in reclaimed wood. On a rainy day, the building is a demonstration of hydraulics and kinetic energy, as water pours from the scuppers and splashes into the cor-ten steel catch basins. The design has received many accolades, including the 2013 American Institute of Architects Cote Top Ten Green Project Award. The jury stated \\"This is an example of wedding together buildings that perform well but also are aesthetically rich, and culturally useful, beneficial, and beautiful in their own way. The project has a very honest expression of the materials—it's very clear what this building is made of. It's creative in its architectural expression in a way that's sculptural and sort of bold and solid like the sciences that are studied within. Seventy-seven percent energy reduction below the baseline in Duluth’s severe climate also is impressive.\\" Marshall Performing Arts Center Marshall Performing Arts Center was built in the 1970s and is a 715-seat flexible thrust/proscenium theatre presenting an array of theatre and dance events. It was named after the parents of Julia and Caroline Marshall and Jessica Marshall Spencer (Albert and Julia N. Marshall) who were donors to the university. The Dudley Experimental Theatre (a black- box theatre within MPAC) was named for another donor, Marjorie Congdon Dudley. Marshall W. Alworth Planetarium The construction of the Marshall W. Alworth Planetarium was supported by Marshall W. Alworth. Alworth grew up in Duluth and attended Duluth Central High School and later Dartmouth College. He also donated funds towards scholarships which today are valued at over $35 million. The Marshall W. Alworth Planetarium has a dome, which seats 65. Astronomical programs are delivered with an optomechanical Spitz A3P star machine, a full-dome digital projection system running UniView® software, surround sound, and programmable LRGB LED lighting. The planetarium is home to the Darling telescope, a 9-inch refracting telescope that belonged to John H. Darling. Swenson Science Building Completed in 2006, the building is situated on the main corridor into the 244 acre campus and contains 108,000 gross square feet of inter disciplinary research and teaching laboratories for Chemistry, Fresh Water Ecology and Biology and creates a link between the academic and residential areas of the campus. Designed by Ross Barney Architects of Chicago, Illinois, the new building provides 16 undergraduate instructional laboratories for 2100 students, 16 research laboratories for faculty and postdoctoral researchers, offices for faculty, graduate and postgraduate students, and the Biology departments administration. One unique feature is the wild rice research laboratory built into the watershed creating a front yard and an outdoor learning space. The outdoor area of the Swenson Science Building was designed by landscape architecture firm oslund.and.assoc. with the concept of \\"Science on Display\\", playing upon the idea that seeing is the ideal way to understand scientific concepts. The landscape features an experimental stormwater wetland garden, outdoor classrooms, experimental garden pool, and outdoor laboratories. The native plantings pay homage to the native peoples of Minnesota, with the water garden showcasing the cultivation of wild rice, a cultural staple of some of the Native Americans of the area. In 2007, this landscape won a 2007 ASLA General Design Honor Award.

The school competes at the NCAA Division II level in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC) in all sports except ice hockey. The men's hockey program plays in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) after previously playing in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). The women's hockey program still competes in the Division I Western Collegiate Hockey Association. On 13 December 2008, the undefeated Bulldogs won the NCAA Division II National Football Championship—the first Division II championship in any sport at the school. On December 18, 2010, the Bulldogs won their second NCAA Division II National Football Championship in a 3-year span, and their second in school history beating Delta State University. On April 9, 2011, the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey team defeated the University of Michigan 3-2 in overtime for the NCAA Division I men's hockey national title, their first. On April 7, 2018, after the Bulldogs were the last team to receive an at-large bid in the tournament, the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey team defeated Notre Dame 2-1 for their second NCAA Division I men's hockey national championship. The team won its second consecutive championship (and third overall) on April 13, 2019, after defeating the University of Massachusetts Amherst 3-0. The Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey team has won five NCAA Division I national titles (2001, 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2010.) Facilities UMD's Football, Soccer and Track and Field teams compete at Griggs Field in James S. Malosky Stadium. Hockey is played off campus at Amsoil Arena in the DECC. Basketball and Volleyball teams play in Romano Gymnasium on campus. Baseball is played in Bulldog Park and softball is played in Junction Avenue Field Student life Fraternities and sororities There are several fraternities and sororities that UMD students can join. Sororities include Gamma Sigma Sigma, Beta Lambda Psi (a local sorority), Phi Sigma Sigma, and Alpha Sigma Tau. Fraternities include Phi Kappa Psi, Alpha Delta, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Kappa Tau, and Alpha Nu Omega (a local fraternity, not to be confused with the national Alpha Nu Omega organization). Students must be an active member of a fraternity or sorority in good standing before serving on Greek Council. The UMD Greek system is run like a senate body where all organizations are represented by two delegates. Although the council had financial disagreements involving the membership fee which led to the departure of Alpha Phi Omega in the fall of 2009, they have since rejoined. In April 2013 Alpha Phi Omega transferred to Alpha Delta due to conflicts at a national level.Engage Your Education!

Amit Singhal, a computer scientist, led Google's core search team for 15 years. Notable donations Joel Labovitz Joel Labovitz is founder of Labovitz Enterprises, a diversified investment firm based in Duluth with a focus on the hospitality industry. Previously, Joel Labovitz was President and CEO of Maurices, the retail clothing company that was founded in 1931 in Duluth by his father, Maurice Labovitz.Living Life Forward: Memoirs of a Lucky Life, by Joel Labovitz. Stewart-Taylor Printing, Duluth, MN, 2006. James Swenson James Swenson, a University of Minnesota Duluth Alumnus, donated more than $21 million to the school, with his most recent donation of $10.7 million toward the College of Science and Engineering. $3 million of this was dedicated to the new civil engineering building and the remaining $7.7 million was given as scholarships for students in science and research programs. This donation helps to continue to support the scholarship programs the Swenson family started in 1994. Since the program began, UMD has awarded scholarships to over 200 students. Because of his generous donations over the years, the school renamed the College of Science and Engineering to be the Swenson College of Science and Engineering. \\"It's nice to have our names on buildings, but there's a lot of gratification in helping these young people,\\" said Swenson. The Swensons are natives of Superior, Wisconsin, and have since relocated to California. James completed his bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1959 at UMD. He then worked in the computer industry with his circuit shop, Details Inc., which he sold in 1997. James passed away in October 2018.

Copenhagen. So What Exactly is Behavior? While specific traits of one's personality, temperament, and genetics may be more consistent, other behaviors will change as one moves along different stages of their life, i.e. from birth through adolescence, adulthood, and, for example, parenthood and retirement. Behavior is also driven, in part, by thoughts and feelings, which provide insight into individual psyche, revealing such things as attitudes and values. Human behavior is shaped by psychological traits, as personality types vary from person to person, producing different actions and behavior. Extraverted people, for instance, are more likely than introverted people to participate in social activities like parties.Argyle, Michael, and Luo Lu. 1990. \\"The happiness of extraverts.\\" Personality and Individual Differences 11(10):1011–17. . The behavior of humans (just as of other organisms) falls upon a spectrum, whereby some behaviors are common while others unusual, and some are acceptable while others beyond acceptable limits. The acceptability of behavior depends heavily upon social norms and is regulated by various means of social control, partly due to the inherently conformist nature of human society in general. Thus, social norms also condition behavior, whereby humans are pressured into following certain rules and displaying certain behaviors that are deemed acceptable or unacceptable depending on the given society or culture. Human behavior is studied by the social sciences, which include psychology, sociology, economics, and anthropology. In sociology, behavior may broadly refer to all basic human actions, including those which possess no meaning; actions directed at no person. Behavior in this general sense should not be mistaken with social behavior. Social behavior, a subset of human behavior that accounts for actions directed at others, is concerned with the considerable influence of social interaction and culture, as well as ethics, social environment, authority, persuasion, and coercion. Factors Genetics Long before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1858, animal breeders knew that patterns of behavior are somehow influenced by inheritance from parents. Studies of identical twins as compared to less-closely-related human beings, and of children brought up in adoptive homes, have helped scientists understand the influence of genetics on human behavior. The study of human behavioral genetics is still developing steadily with new methods such as genome-wide association studies.Anholt, Robert R. H., and Trudy Mackay. 2010. Principles of behavioral genetics. Academic Press. . Lay summary.Purcell, Shaun. 2012. \\"Statistical Methods in Behavioral Genetics\\" Appendix in Behavioral Genetics (6th ed.), edited by R. Plomin, J. C. DeFries, V. S. Knopik, and J. M. Neiderhiser. Worth Publishers. . Retrieved 5 June 2020. Lay summary. Evolutionary psychology studies behavior as the product of natural selection, whereby both human behavior and psychology are shaped by our evolutionary past. According to this field, humans attempt to increase their social status as much as possible, which increases their chances of reproductive success. They may do this by fighting, amassing wealth, or helping others with their problems. Social norms Social norms, the often unspoken rules of a group, shape not only our behaviors but also our attitudes. An individual’s behavior varies depending on the group(s) they are a part of, a characteristic of society that allows their norms to heavily impact society. Without social norms, human society would not function as it currently does; humans would have to be more abstract in their behavior, as there would not be a pre-tested 'normal' standardized lifestyle, and individuals would have to make many more choices for themselves. The institutionalization of norms is, however, inherent in human society perhaps as a direct result of the desire to be accepted by others, which leads humans to manipulate their own behavior in order to 'fit in' with others. Depending on their nature and upon one's perspective, norms can impact different sections of society both positively (e.g. attending birthday celebrations, dressing warm in the winter) and negatively (e.g. racism, drug use). Creativity Creativity is a fundamental human trait. It can be seen in tribes' adaptation of natural objects to make tools, and in the uniquely human pursuits of art and music. This creative impulse explains the constant change in fashion, technology, and food in modern society. People use creative endeavors, like art and literature, to distinguish themselves within their social group. They also use their creativity to make money and persuade others of the value of their ideas. Religion and spirituality Another important aspect of human behavior is religion and spirituality. According to a Pew Research Center report, 54% of adults around the world state that religion is very important in their lives. Religion plays a large role in the lives of many people around the world, and it affects their behavior towards others.Spilka, B., and D. N. McIntosh. 1996. The psychology of religion. Westview Press. For example, one of the five pillars of Islam is zakat. This is the practice whereby Muslims who can afford to are required to donate 2.5% of their wealth to those in need. Many religious people regularly attend services with other members of their religion. They may take part in religious rituals, and festivals like Diwali and Easter. Attitude An attitude is an expression of favor or disfavor toward a person, place, thing, or event.Wyer, R. S. J. 1965. \\"Effect of child-rearing attitudes and behavior on childrens responses to hypothetical social situations.\\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 2(4):480–86. . It alters between each individual, as everyone holds different attitudes towards different things. A main factor that determines attitude is likes and dislikes: the more one likes something or someone, the more one is willing to open up and accept what they have to offer; one dislikes something, they are more likely to get defensive and shut down. An example of how one's attitude affects one's human behavior could be as simple as taking a child to the park or to the doctor. Children know they have fun at the park so their attitude becomes willing and positive, but when a doctor is mentioned, they shut down and become upset with the thought of pain. Attitudes can sculpt personalities and the way people view who we are. People with similar attitudes tend to stick together as interests and hobbies are common. This does not mean that people with different attitudes do not interact, the fact is they do. What it means is that specific attitudes can bring people together (e.g., religious groups). The way a human behaves depends a lot on how they look at the situation and what they expect to gain from it.Kechmanovic, D. 1969. \\"The paranoid attitude as the common form of social behavior.\\" Sociologija 11(4):573–85. . Weather and climate The weather and climate have a significant influence on human behavior. The average temperature of a country affects its traditions and people's everyday routines. For example, Spain used to be a primarily agrarian country, with much of its labour force working in the fields. Spaniards developed the tradition of the siesta, an after-lunch nap, to cope with the intense midday heat. The siesta persists despite the increased use of air conditioning and the move from farming to office jobs. However, it is less common today than in the past. Norway is a northern country with cold average temperatures and short hours of daylight in winter. This has shaped its lunchtime habits. Norwegians have a fixed half an hour lunch break. This enables them to go home earlier, with many leaving work at three o'clock in the afternoon. This allows them to make the most of the remaining daylight. There is a correlation between higher temperatures and increased levels of violent crime. There are a number of theories for why this is. One theory is that people are more inclined to go outside during warmer weather, and this increases the number of opportunities for criminals. Another is that high temperatures cause a physiological response that increases people's irritability, and therefore their likeliness to escalate perceived slights into violence. There is some research detailing that changes in the weather can affect the behavior of children. One study suggests that classroom misbehavior peaked during the period of \\"calm before the storm.\\" See also * Behavioral modernity * Behaviorism * Behavioral economics * Feminine psychology * Human behavioral ecology * Human communication * Human ethology * Human sexual behavior * Mathematical principles of reinforcement * Motivation * Nature versus nurture References  Further reading  *Ardrey, Robert. 1970.

Founded in 1947 by Basilian Fathers, it is the only Catholic university in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. Its main campus is in Montrose, Houston; St. Mary's Seminary is a separate campus, and it has an additional campus in Conroe. History On June 24, 1944, the bishop of the Diocese of Galveston, Christopher E. Byrne, entered into an agreement with the Houston-based members of the Congregation of St. Basil to found a co-educational Roman Catholic university in Houston \\"as soon as practicable after the War, if possible by 1947.\\" The Basilian Fathers had previously started several other secondary schools, as well as institutions of higher learning, throughout Texas in the early 20th century, including St. Thomas High School, also located in Houston. The first classes at UST began on September 22, 1947, with 57 freshmen and 8 faculty members. UST graduated its first class on May 31, 1951. In addition to the Basilian Fathers on staff, there were for some time also several Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist who reside in the convent on campus. The order no longer has a presence there, but the Houston Vietnamese Dominican Sisters and the Sisters of Mary Mother of the Eucharist serve in some teaching capacities. The university is named after St. Thomas Aquinas. Originally consisting solely of the Link–Lee House on the corner of Montrose and West Alabama, the university has expanded towards the South and West over the last 60 years, establishing itself as a notable landmark in Houston with over 20,000 graduates. The current expansion plan includes the acquisition and development of the majority of the land comprising 25 city blocks. Former university president J. Michael Miller, C.S.B. was appointed on November 25, 2003, by the pope to preside as secretary of the Congregation of Catholic Education. By virtue of this office, Miller was elevated to archbishop by Pope John Paul II on January 12, 2004. Campuses Main The University of St. Thomas's main campus is located in the Montrose neighborhood of Neartown. The campus borders Houston's Museum District and is adjacent to the Menil Collection and the Rothko Chapel. Many of the university's offices are in houses built in 1930s that are scattered throughout campus. Some of the buildings are historic including the Link–Lee House. This was once the largest home in Houston. It contains the university's executive office. The Theology department is located in the childhood home of Howard Hughes. The campus is arranged in a square format, with the main focus of buildings on the north side of the campus which is called the Academic Mall. Composed of rectangular buildings, the Academic Mall is the symbolic architecture of Philip Johnson. On the south end of the Academic Mall is the Doherty Library. The Chapel of St. Basil is located at the opposite end. Four structures flank these two buildings on each side in a rectangular formation surrounding a courtyard. The setup is designed to display the methods of human knowledge (faith, represented by the Chapel, and reason, represented by the library) in dialogue regarding the various subject matters. The Chapel of St. Basil is the main location of Catholic worship on campus. The Chapel of St. Basil is a unique work of art that has won many awards for its architecture. Basil was a fourth-century bishop who was a proponent of both education and the monastic life. The Chapel sits at the north end of the Academic Mall, representing faith in the Academic Mall's artistic depiction of faith and reason balanced in dialogue. There is no artificial light inside the main section of the building during the daytime. There is sufficient sunlight to fully light the worship space, as a combination of smooth textures and reflective surfaces maximize all light shone in the building. At night, the lights from outside combined with candles inside the Chapel are more than enough to illuminate the worship area. The entry to the outdoor narthex of the Chapel is created with a tent-like flap extending over the entry, creating an enclosed space that is still outdoors. The architecture also shifts the focus the building: the entrances to the Chapel face away from the center of the building and towards the tabernacle to remind all who enter that the central point of the Chapel is not the altar or the crucifix, but the location of the Eucharist. During the 2005–2006 school year, the Gueymard Meditation Garden was built on the west side of the Chapel. The garden features three fountains, representing the persons of the Trinity, and benches for reflection. It also includes a replica of the labyrinth in the Cathedral of Chartres in France. Seen from above, the four arms of the pattern stand out as a clear image of the cross of Jesus Christ. Completed in September 1972, The Robert Pace and Ada Mary Doherty Library (located at the southern end of the Academic Mall) is one of the premier research libraries in Houston. It houses over 250,000 books, 80,000 periodicals, and 150 databases. In 2019 the university unveiled a mural created by Mario Figueroa Jr. (Gonzo247), the first such mural on this campus. St. Mary's Seminary The school of theology is in St. Mary's Seminary. Conroe The first phase of the Conroe campus is to open in fall 2020, with the Old Conroe Police building as a temporary site for up to three years. The permanent campus is proposed to be at Deison Technology Park. Class of 1952 alumnus Vincent D’Amico offered the university of land in east Montgomery County for the project. Students and alumni The university currently maintains a population of 1,609 traditional undergraduate students and 1,973 graduate students. Adding to this number are non-traditional, off- campus, study-abroad, special program, and seminary students that bring the grand total to 3,582 students. UST enrolls a diverse group of students with 61% of the total number of students African-American, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian. UST also maintains a student body that is at least 25% Hispanic. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities rates UST as an Hispanic-serving institution; it is the only private institution of higher education in Houston to earn this rating. 58% of the total enrollment is Catholic. University students come from 40 states throughout the U.S. as well as 54 countries around the world. Special programs UST offers several special programs within its curriculum, consisting of undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees, and special preparation programs. Center For Thomistic Studies The Philosophy Department of the University of St. Thomas offers masters and doctoral degrees in philosophy, specializing in the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas and his commentators. In addition, professors in the department publish works on Thomist philosophy in conjunction with the University of Notre Dame Press. Pre-health professional programs The university offers a strong pre-health undergraduate program with a liberal-arts foundation. Graduates experience high interview and acceptance rates at medical and dental schools. Advisers are very involved, from the First Year Experience to preparing for the MCAT or DAT. UST offers pre-dental, pre-medical, pre-optometry, pre-pharmacy, pre- physical therapy, pre-physician assistant and pre-veterinary medicine. Engineering cooperative program In engineering, the university has cooperative agreements with Texas A&M; University, the University of Houston, and the University of Notre Dame. Students earn a BA degree in mathematics from UST and a BS degree in engineering at the cooperative institution. During the three years at UST, students complete an individualized plan of study that combines a broad liberal-arts background with the prerequisites for the program at the chosen school. The UST cooperative engineering program has a 100% acceptance rate. Pre-law program Much like the pre-health professional programs, the pre-law program is not a major in itself, but an additional program which can be combined with any major. Pre-law students enroll in required pre-law courses that help prepare for the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT), Socratic examination, and case briefing. To support UST students in applying to law school, the university participates in a cooperative admission program with South Texas College of Law. Cameron School of Business The Cameron School of Business is home to about 240 undergraduate and about 387 graduate students. Its programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Programs include: * a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) with majors in Accounting, Economics, Finance, General Business and Marketing * Master of Business Administration (MBA) * Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) * Master of Science in Finance (MSF) * a five-year BBA/MBA * Master in International Business (MIB) Center for Business Ethics Established in 1998, the Center for Business Ethics strives to educate students and the community on making good choices that benefit their businesses and the community at large. Through education and collaboration with the Houston community at large, the center promotes \\"ethics in all things.\\" The center has amassed a community of students—undergraduate and graduate, faculty, alumni, and community members—to support an ethical business society. The center offers: * ethical leadership education and symposia * conferences on business ethics * public lectures * co-hosting of the Ethical Leadership in Action Award * participation with the Greater Houston Business Ethics Roundtable The CBE also hosts the Women in Business Forum and the Business Ethics Society; it is the signature program of the Amom Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by a Cameron School of Business MBA alumnus; and it participates in the annual President's Day of Service. School of Education At the undergraduate level, the School of Education offers programs in general education (from pre-K through high school), bilingual education, and exceptionality. In addition to its undergraduate programs, the School of Education offers several masters level programs. One such program is directed towards Catholic educators. Following their undergraduate career, students enter into a two-year rotation in a masters program in conjunction with the university's Gulf Regional Academy of Catholic Educators (GRACE) program. Over the two years, students live in community as they learn skills needed in the classroom. All students are given a two-year teaching job for practical experience, which can become a permanent job during the school term following their completion of the program. UST also offers programs for teacher certification. Transition to Teaching allows students with a bachelor's degree to complete a few graduate classes to teach in Catholic or public schools. All Transition to Teaching classes can be used as part of a graduate degree upon completion of formal graduate admission. Glassell School of Art The UST Department of Fine and Performing Arts and the Glassell School of Art at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts collaborate in offering BA and BFA majors, a minor, and elective courses in Studio Art. This joint effort gives UST students access to the resources of the Glassell School and to instruction offered by the artists on its faculty while receiving credit at the university towards a degree. Mendenhall Achievement Center The Mendenhall Achievement Center, established in 2008, provides a professional support team to assist students in achieving their goals while enrolled at UST. Services include advising, mentoring, tutoring, and counseling. Additionally, the Mendenhall Summer Institute is a five-week program that allows incoming freshmen to complete six credit hours before their freshman year. Study Abroad The Institute for International Education Exchange has consistently ranked UST as one of the top 20 master's schools in the United States for study abroad participation by undergraduate students. Approximately 8% of its undergraduates choose to study abroad for a semester, compared to the national average of 2%. School of Theology The School of Theology is located at St. Mary's Seminary on Memorial Drive. Seminarians from various dioceses in Texas as well as the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter study here. The School of Theology also offers degrees for lay students. Athletics UST athletic teams are known as the Celts. The university is a provisional member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III, having joined the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC) in the 2019–20 academic year. The university was previously competed at the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) level as a member of the Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC). Men's sports are baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, and track and field; women's sports are basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball; cheer competes as a co-ed sport. Student life Residential housing The university has two types of campus housing, both under the direction of Residence Life. Guinan Residence Hall is a three-story, 306-bed facility with private double- occupancy rooms. It is located near the Moran Parking Center and Crooker Center and provides a residential experience focused on community living. Young Hall, located on the south side of campus, offers apartments to upper- class students and graduate or adult students who want to benefit from a Residence Life community. Neewollah An annual tradition dating back more than 50 years is the \\"Neewollah\\" Party (Halloween spelled backwards), held every year in October. Hundreds of students dress up in costume and party on campus as various local bands and DJs provide music. Students compete for prizes in costume and dance contests. The event draws about 600 people and is held on Crooker Patio, a large area in front of the university's dining hall. Other campus events * Cinco de Mayo Celebration * Houston Italian Festival * International Festival * Spring Formal * Salsa Night * Texas Independence Day Celebration Student organizations The Student Organizations Committee is a collective of student leaders from five major organizations that oversee many areas of student life. There is no presiding officer of the SOC. All SOC members have an administrative or faculty adviser. SOC members are allowed to petition for operating budgets before other organizations and/or clubs can request funds for the following school year. Members of the SOC *The Student Government Association is the legislative student body at UST. The senate body consists of up to four representatives from each class (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, and graduate) who are elected into office. An executive board led by an elected president and an elected vice president oversee the SGA. The SGA president can appoint a secretary, treasurer, historian, parliamentarian, and webmaster. The SGA's main function is to allocate funds collected by the Student Activity Fee. It holds regular meetings every Tuesday in the Council of Clubs meeting room in Crooker Center. *The Student Activities Board is the main programming organization at UST. SAB is led by an elected president and an elected vice president. It is responsible for planning traditional events like Neewollah and Spring Formal, as well as occasional open mic and monthly bingo nights. *The Council of Clubs is an umbrella organization that represents clubs on campus. It is led by an elected chair and an appointed vice chair. The COC provides funding for various clubs at UST. Interested clubs may request membership into the COC and may be approved with a simple majority vote by eligible clubs, called the board of directors. *The Sport Clubs Associations is responsible for the sport clubs on campus. It is led by an elected president. Like the COC, it is an umbrella organization that funds athletic- oriented clubs and teams at UST. *The Graduate Student Association is responsible for representing and catering to the graduate students of UST, which make up about 55% of the student body. In addition to helping integrate graduate students with the campus, it provides independent programming open to both graduates and undergraduates. Non-SOC Organizations The university acknowledges 82 student organizations, most of which fall within SOC jurisdiction, but other organizations are overseen by other departments of the university. Honor Societies and Academic Clubs are often overseen by their departments, but some seek SOC approval for financial purposes. Other organizations are under the directorship of administrative offices such as Campus Ministry. Others include the Knights of Columbus, Catholic Daughters of the Americas Court of St. Macrina, Legion of Mary, and over 20 department-run honor societies. In 2009, the UST Knights of Columbus were rated among the top 3% of college councils in the United States. Publications *The Summa, founded in September 2008, is the newspaper serving the UST community. The Summa is led by a student editor-in-chief as well as various section editors and staff members. The staff is responsible for producing the paper, which is published on the first and third Thursdays of every month during the fall and spring semesters. *Laurels literary magazine publishes poems, short fiction, and other creative writing submitted by enrolled students. It is led by three appointed editors. During the fall, the three editors are responsible for the administration and editing of the issue. However, a curriculum-approved Literary magazine class, in cooperation with the editors, is responsible for the spring issue. *Thoroughfare magazine is the newest publication on campus. Modeled after The New Yorker as a \\"features\\" magazine, it highlights students, organizations, events, places, and local occurrences in Houston. It is led by an appointed student editor-in-chief with the help of a student staff.

It was first published in September 1740, a few months after Frederick became king.Frederick The Great- Encyclopedia Britannica Composition and publication The work, written in French, was produced at a turning point in Frederick's life, after his turbulent and rebellious youth, and immediately before his assumption of the throne of Prussia. Frederick had, of course, read Machiavelli long before; it is not exactly clear what drew his attention to this subject in the late 1730s, although his affiliation with Voltaire and his impending change in rank most certainly contributed to the project. It is known from letters to Voltaire that Frederick began to ruminate on the project early in 1738; his draft of the brief work was completed by the end of 1739.Frederick II to Voltaire, 6 November (1739), Correspondence, VII Voltaire took over in Summer 1740. Living in Huis Honselaarsdijk, the Prussian residence near The Hague, and working with a dubious printer named Jan van Duren, Voltaire revised the text extensively on purpose and in order to get the manuscript back.Strien, K. van (2011) Voltaire in Holland, 1736-1745Anti- Machiavel by Frederick II, p. x There was also a combined edition, with Voltaire's emendations as footnotes. Frederick sent Francesco Algarotti to London to take care of the publication of Anti-Machiavel in English. In the meantime, Frederick had become king, and his authorship — which was a very open secret — made the book an instant success and bestseller. Not surprisingly, Frederick had other matters to occupy his attention, and he did not return to the work in an appreciable way. Argument Frederick's argument is essentially moral in nature: he asserts that Machiavelli offered a partial and biased view of statecraft. His own views appear to reflect a largely Enlightenment ideal of rational and benevolent statesmanship: the king, Frederick contends, is charged with maintaining the health and prosperity of his subjects. On the one hand, then, Machiavelli erred by assigning too great a value on princely machinations that, Frederick claims, ended in disaster, as the king's evil actions are taken up by his subjects. On the other hand, and in support of the first idea, Frederick points out the numerous cases in which Machiavelli had ignored or slighted the bad ends of the numerous malefactors he describes and praises.

This structure allows the user's eye to operate as both a monitor and a camera as the EyeTap intakes the world around it and augments the image the user sees allowing it to overlay computer-generated data over top of the normal world the user would perceive. In order to capture what the eye is seeing as accurately as possible, an EyeTap uses a beam splitter to send the same scene (with reduced intensity) to both the eye and a camera. The camera then digitizes the reflected image of the scene and sends it to a computer. The computer processes the image and then sends it to a projector. The projector sends the image to the other side of the beam splitter so that this computer-generated image is reflected into the eye to be superimposed on the original scene. Stereo EyeTaps modify light passing through both eyes, but many research prototypes (mainly for reasons of ease of construction) only tap one eye. EyeTap is also the name of an organization founded by inventor Steve Mann to develop and promote EyeTap-related technologies such as wearable computers.  Possible uses  Inventor Steve Mann using weather-resistant EyeTap together with a hydraulophone An EyeTap is somewhat like a head-up display (HUD). The important difference is that the scene available to the eye is also available to the computer that projects the head-up display. This enables the EyeTap to modify the computer generated scene in response to the natural scene. One use, for instance, would be a sports EyeTap: here the wearer, while in a stadium, would be able to follow a particular player in a field and have the EyeTap display statistics relevant to that player as a floating box above the player. Another practical use for the EyeTap would be in a construction yard as it would allow the user to reference the blueprints, especially in a 3D manner, to the current state of the building, display a list of current materials and their current locations as well perform basic measurements. Or, even in the business world, the EyeTap has great potential, for it would be capable of delivering to the user constant up to date information on the stock market, the user's corporation, and meeting statuses. On a more day-to-day basis some of Steve Mann's first uses for the technology was using it to keep track of names of people and places, his to-do lists, and keeping track of his other daily ordeals. The EyeTap Criteria are an attempt to define how close a real, practical device comes to such an ideal. EyeTaps could have great use in any field where the user would benefit from real-time interactive information that is largely visual in nature. This is sometimes referred to as computer-mediated reality, commonly known as augmented reality. Eyetap has been explored as a potential tool for individuals with visual disabilities due to its abilities to direct visual information to parts of the retina that function well. As well, Eyetap's role in sousveillance has been explored by Mann, Jason Nolan and Barry Wellman.  Possible side effects  Users may find that they experience side effects such as headaches and difficulty sleeping if usage occurs shortly before sleep. Mann finds that due to his extensive use of the device that going without it can cause him to feel \\"nauseous, unsteady, naked\\" when he removes it.  Cyborglogs & EyeTaps  The EyeTap has applications in the world of cyborg logging, as it allows the user the ability to perform real-time visual capture of their daily lives from their own point of view. In this way, the EyeTap could be used to create a lifelong cyborg log or “glog” of the user's life and the events they participate in, potentially recording enough media to allow producers centuries in the future to present the user's life as interactive entertainment (or historical education) to consumers of that era.  History  Steve Mann created the first version of the EyeTap, which consisted of a computer in a backpack wired up to a camera and its viewfinder which in turn was rigged to a helmet. Ever since this first version, it has gone through multiple models as wearable computing evolves, allowing the EyeTap to shrink down to a smaller and less weighty version. Currently the EyeTap consists of the eyepiece used to display the images, the keypad which the user can use to interface with the EyeTap and have it perform the desired tasks, a CPU which can be attached to most articles of clothing and in some cases even a Wi-Fi device so the user can access the Internet and online data.  Principle of operation  The EyeTap is essentially a half-silvered mirror in front of the user's eye, reflecting some of the light into a sensor. The sensor then sends the image to the aremac, a display device capable of displaying data at any fitting depth. The output rays from the aremac are reflected off the half- silvered mirror back into the eye of the user along with the original light rays. In these cases, the EyeTap views infrared light, as well as the overall design schematic of how the EyeTap manipulates lightrays.

Set in London during and just after the Second World War, the novel examines the obsessions, jealousy and discernments within the relationships between three central characters: writer Maurice Bendrix; Sarah Miles; and her husband, civil servant Henry Miles. Graham Greene's own affair with Catherine Walston played into the basis for The End of the Affair. The British edition of the novel is dedicated to \\"C\\" while the American version is made out to \\"Catherine\\". Greene's own house at 14 Clapham Common Northside was bombed during the Blitz.Graham Greene, uneasy Catholic – TLS Highlights – Times Online Synopsis The novel focuses on Maurice Bendrix, a rising writer during the Second World War in London, and Sarah Miles, the wife of an impotent civil servant. Bendrix is based on Greene himself, and he reflects often on the act of writing a novel. Sarah is based on Greene's lover at the time, Catherine Walston, to whom the book is dedicated. Bendrix and Sarah fall in love quickly, but he soon realises that the affair will end as quickly as it began. The relationship suffers from his overt and admitted jealousy. He is frustrated by her refusal to divorce Henry, her amiable but boring husband. When a bomb blasts Bendrix's flat as he is with Sarah, he is nearly killed. After this, Sarah breaks off the affair with no apparent explanation. Later, Bendrix is still wracked with jealousy when he sees Henry crossing the Common that separates their flats. Henry has finally started to suspect something, and Bendrix decides to go to a private detective to discover Sarah's new lover. Through her diary, he learns that, when she thought he was dead after the bombing, she made a promise to God not to see Bendrix again if He allowed him to live again. Greene describes Sarah's struggles. After her sudden death from a lung infection brought to a climax by walking on the Common in the rain, several miraculous events occur, advocating for some kind of meaningfulness to Sarah's faith. By the last page of the novel, Bendrix came to believe in a God as well. The End of the Affair is the fourth and last of Greene's \\"Catholic novels\\". Critical response The End of the Affair is often considered among Greene's best novels. Writer Evelyn Waugh favorably reviewed the novel in a September 6, 1951 piece for The Month magazine. Waugh would later write, \\"Mr Greene has chosen another contemporary form, domestic, romantic drama of the type of Brief Encounter, and has transformed that in his own inimitable way.\\" Waugh also noted that the story was “a singularly beautiful and moving one\\".McCrum, Robert. \\"The 100 best novels: No 71 – The End of the Affair by Graham Greene (1951)\\" (26 Jan 2015) The Guardian, Retrieved on 22 March 2020.

The novel was chosen by Robert McCrum for his list of the '100 Greatest Novels in English'. Writer Jonathan Franzen said that he considered E. M. Forster and Graham Greene overrated, in particular highlighting The End of the Affair.Jonathan Franzen on Overrated Books (Youtube, April 23, 2012) However, he did also comment that he believed that part of the reason for this was his being American, as he said that many authors' brilliance is lost when it crosses the Atlantic. He said that he believed that the effect may have occurred with David Foster Wallace. Adaptations In 1955, the book was made into a film, directed by Edward Dmytryk, with the screenplay adaptation by Lenore J. Coffee. David Lewis was the producer and David E. Rose executive producer. It starred Deborah Kerr as Sarah Miles, Van Johnson as Maurice Bendrix, John Mills as Albert Parkis, and Peter Cushing as Henry Miles. In 1999, the novel was made into another film (The End of the Affair), directed by Neil Jordan. Jordan also wrote the screenplay and produced the film with Stephen Woolley. It starred American actress Julianne Moore as Sarah Miles, English actor Ralph Fiennes as Maurice Bendrix, and Irish actor Stephen Rea as Henry Miles. Julianne Moore was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. In 2004, Jake Heggie composed an opera based on the novel. It premiered at the Houston Grand Opera in March of that year, and was subsequently revised into its final form.

In common with other Maserati cars of the era, it is named after a wind, Bora being the wind of Trieste. The Bora ended Maserati's reputation for producing fast but technologically out of date cars, being the first Maserati with four wheel independent suspension. In contrast, competitor Lamborghini had used independent suspension in 1964. History Shortly after Citroën took a controlling interest in Maserati in 1968, the concept of a mid-engined two-seat sports car was proposed. Lamborghini and De Tomaso already had the Miura and Mangusta, whilst Ferrari were known to be developing their own mid-engined contender. Initially known as Tipo 117 and later the Bora, the Maserati project got underway in October 1968 and a prototype was on the road by mid-1969. Shown in its final form at the Geneva Salon in March 1971, deliveries began before the end of the year. Maserati struggled after being bought by De Tomaso in 1975, and the Bora was discontinued after the 1978 model year. 564 Boras were produced in total, of which 275 were fitted with 4.9 L engines and the other 289 were fitted with 4.7 L engines. Design The Bora was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign and has a drag coefficient of 0.30. Fabrication of the all-steel panels was contracted to Officine Padane of Modena. The Bora had a number of innovative features that distinguished the car from Maserati's previous offerings. Compared to other supercars, it was civilized and practical, featuring a hydraulically powered pedal cluster that could be moved forward and backwards at the touch of a button and a steering wheel that could be tilted and telescoped, addressing the familiar problem of entering and exiting the vehicle typical of many supercars. Most supercars offer little foot room and little to no provision for luggage, but the Bora has a full-size trunk in the front of the vehicle, and was otherwise known as being much more civilized in comforts from its competitors. Unlike its competitors, the Bora used dual- pane glass separating its cabin from the engine compartment as well as a carpeted aluminum engine cap, greatly decreasing the engine noise in the cabin and increasing the comfort level for the driver. The engine and five-speed ZF transaxle were mounted on a subframe attached to the monocoque via four flexible mounts,  Specifications  Initially two V8 engines were offered, a high-revving and a higher torque ; a US smog-qualified 4.9-litre engine was used (a stroked version of the 4.7), starting from the 1973 model year. Eventually, production switched to only using a more powerful version of the 4.9-litre engine rated at at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. All these engines traced their lineage back to the famous 450S racecar, were made of aluminium alloy and had hemispherical combustion chambers with 16 valves total operated by four cams (chain-driven). Both engines were mounted longitudinally in the middle of the car and were mated to a ZF-1 five-speed transaxle sending power to the rear wheels. They were fed by four 42 DCNF/14 downdraught Weber carburetors with Bosch electronic ignition. The compression ratio is 8.5:1. A combined steel monocoque chassis and body featured a tubular steel subframe at the back for the engine and transmission. Also featured independent suspension all round (a first for a Maserati road car) with coil springs, telescopic suspension dampers and anti-roll bars. The development prototype and the broadly similar show car first seen at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show featured MacPherson strut based front suspension, but this was abandoned for production because, installed in combination with very wide front tyres and rack-and- pinion steering, the strut-based solution produced severe kickback. For the production cars Maserati reverted to a more conservative wishbone front- suspension arrangement. Citroën's advanced high-pressure LHM hydraulics were adopted to operate the ventilated disc brakes on the main circuit, and on an auxiliary circuit the pedal box (clutch, brake, foot-throttle), the driver's seat (only vertical adjustments), and the retractable headlights. Wheels were Campagnolo light alloy type with distinctive removable polished stainless steel hubcaps in the earlier models. Tyres were Michelin XWX 205x70 front and rear, however these early cars exhibited problems with \\"tramlining\\" at speed. To solve this problem Maserati fitted later cars with 215/70VR15 tyres on the rear, with the choice of Michelin XWX or Pirelli Cinturato CN12 tyres. The most distinctive details of the Bora were the brushed stainless steel roof and windscreen pillars. Inside, the bucket seats, dash, door trim, centre console and rear bulkhead were trimmed in leather, with electric windows and air conditioning as standard. The steering column was manually adjustable for rake and reach, whereas the LHM aux. circuit controls adjusted the driver's seat vertically, the pedal box (consisting of the brake, clutch and throttle pedals) can be set horizontally forwards and backwards by around a first such application in the world for a production car, and also to raise and lower the concealed headlights in the front fenders. The original estimated weight was , however, noise and safety concerns increased the weight to . It is popularly believed that the Bora is heavier than the Ghibli however the Ghibli weighs , some more than the Bora. The reason for this misconception probably stems from the state of tune of their respective engines as well as the difference in the gearing of the two cars. The official Maserati website quotes a top speed of for the Bora 4.7 and for the Bora 4.9, although many sources give differing top speeds. The first Boras were delivered to customers in late 1971, and only minor production changes were gradually phased in thereafter. About early 1974, front lids became hinged at front instead of rear, pop-up headlights showed rounded inside corners, and a rectangular black air-exit grille was added across the hood (similar to Pantera). From 1973, as the 4.7-litre engine had not been homologated in North America, US Bora models had air-pump emissions-equipped Super-Ghibli engines similar to those found in US-bound Ghiblis. Output was at 6,000 rpm, or less than the Euro-spec' derivative. US safety-compliant front bumpers had to be added to meet US DOT safety legislation, on US-delivered cars, though many US Bora owners have subsequently retro-fitted the original Euro versions. Three years later, the 4.9-litre engine became standard on all Boras, displacement having been stroked from 85 to 89 mm, resulting in a size of 4,930 cc. With compression set at 8.75:1, output was increased by on the 4.7 with ( in Europe) at 5,500 rpm. Production ran from 1971 to 1978, with 564 cars built, 289 of which were 4.7s and the remaining 275 were 4.9s. Maserati developed two Group 4 racing cars at the request of Thepenier, a French Maserati dealer. They were very competitive, but Maserati couldn't produce enough cars to meet the 500 road car homologation rule for Group 4 racing so the project was shelved. The Bora was the basis for the Merak, which used the same bodyshell front clip but in a 2+2 configuration, made possible by using a smaller, lighter and less powerful Maserati V6 engine, also used in the Citroën SM. The Merak was popular, including the later modified and improved Merak SS, making its debut in 1981. Merak models had an opened rear engine-cover instead of the glass-enclosed and heavier cover of the Bora.

Middleton started writing at university and in 1958 published A Short Answer. Alongside his work as an author he taught English at High Pavement Grammar School for many years. In 1974, his novel Holiday won the Booker prize. In 2008 Her Three Wise Men was published, his 44th novel and the last to be published during his lifetime. Middleton was an accomplished organist, playing regularly at St Mark's Methodist Church on Ravensworth Road in Bulwell and stepping in to cover others, often at Mansfield Road Baptist Church in Nottingham. He was also a fine water colourist and contributed his own artwork to the covers of the 1994 novel Catalysts and the festschrift, Stanley Middleton At Eighty. In 2006, a reporter for The Sunday Times sent the first chapters of Holiday to a number of publishers and literary agents as a journalistic stunt. Almost all rejected it. The actor Peter Bowles was taught by Stanley Middleton while a pupil at High Pavement. In 1980 when Bowles was the subject of the popular TV programme This Is Your Life, Stanley Middleton appeared as a guest on the programme. Middleton was married to Margaret Welch from 1951 until his death; the couple had two daughters, Penny and Sarah. Towards the end of his life he suffered from cancer, and died in a nursing home on 25 July 2009, one week before his 90th birthday. It has been revealed that Middleton refused an OBE in 1979. This came to light following a Freedom of information request by the BBC. He did not feel that he should be honoured simply for doing what he regarded as his job.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/26/roald-dahl-cs-lewis-writers- refused-honours Bibliography Fiction * A Short Answer (1958) * Harris's Requiem (1960) * A Serious Woman (1961) * The Just Exchange (1962) * Two's Company (1963) * Him They Compelled (1964) * Terms of Reference (1966) * The Golden Evening (1968) * Wages of Virtue (1969) * Apple of the Eye (1970) * Brazen Prison (1971) * Cold Gradations (1972) * A Man Made of Smoke (1973) * Holiday (1974) * Distractions (1975) * Still Waters (1976) * Ends and Means (1977) * Two Brothers (1978) * In a Strange Land (1979) * The Other Side (1980) * Blind Understanding (1982) * Entry into Jerusalem (1983) * The Daysman (1984) * Valley of Decision (1985) * An After-Dinner's Sleep (1986) * After a Fashion (1987) * Recovery (1988) * Vacant Places (1989) * Changes and Chances (1990) * Beginning to End (1991) * A Place to Stand (1992) * Married Past Redemption (1993) * Catalysts (1994) * Toward the Sea (1995) * Live and Learn (1996) * Brief Hours (1997) * Against the Dark (1998) * Necessary Ends (1999) * Small Change (2000) * Love in the Provinces (2002) * Brief Garlands (2004) * Sterner Stuff (2005) * Mother's Boy (2006) * Her Three Wise Men (2008) * A Cautious Approach (2010) Non-fiction * Stanley Middleton at Eighty (1999) Edited by David Belbin & John Lucas, this festschrift includes short stories, essays by and about Middleton and a long interview with the author.

He had a brief stint in the Western Theater, but he is best known for his defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas) in the East. Pope was a graduate of the United States Military Academy in 1842. He served in the Mexican–American War and had numerous assignments as a topographical engineer and surveyor in Florida, New Mexico, and Minnesota. He spent much of the last decade before the Civil War surveying possible southern routes for the proposed First Transcontinental Railroad. He was an early appointee as a Union brigadier general of volunteers and served initially under Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont. He achieved initial success against Brig. Gen. Sterling Price in Missouri, then led a successful campaign that captured Island No. 10 on the Mississippi River. This inspired the Lincoln administration to bring him to the Eastern Theater to lead the newly formed Army of Virginia. He initially alienated many of his officers and men by publicly denigrating their record in comparison to his Western command. He launched an offensive against the Confederate army of General Robert E. Lee, in which he fell prey to a strategic turning movement into his rear areas by Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson. At Second Bull Run, he concentrated his attention on attacking Jackson while the other Confederate corps attacked his flank and routed his army. Following Manassas, Pope was banished far from the Eastern Theater to the Department of the Northwest in Minnesota, where he commanded U.S. Forces in the Dakota War of 1862. He was appointed to command the Department of the Missouri in 1865 and was a prominent and activist commander during Reconstruction in Atlanta. For the rest of his military career, he fought in the Indian Wars, particularly against the Apache and Sioux. Early life Pope was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Nathaniel Pope, a prominent Federal judge in early Illinois Territory and a friend of lawyer Abraham Lincoln.Frederiksen, pp. 1541–43. He was the brother-in-law of Manning Force, and a distant cousin married the sister of Mary Todd Lincoln.Eicher, pp. 433–34. He graduated from the United States Military Academy, 17th in a class of 56, in 1842, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He served in Florida and then helped survey the northeastern border between the United States and Canada. He fought under Zachary Taylor in the Battle of Monterrey and Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican–American War, for which he was appointed a brevet first lieutenant and captain, respectively. After the war Pope worked as a surveyor in Minnesota. In 1850 he demonstrated the navigability of the Red River. He served as the chief engineer of the Department of New Mexico from 1851 to 1853 and spent the remainder of the antebellum years surveying a route for the Pacific Railroad. Civil War Pope was serving on lighthouse duty when Abraham Lincoln was elected and he was one of four officers selected to escort the president-elect to Washington, D.C. He offered to serve Lincoln as an aide, but on June 14, 1861, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers (date of rank effective May 17, 1861)Warner, pp. 376–77. and was ordered to Illinois to recruit volunteers. In the Department of the West under Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont, Pope assumed command of the District of North and Central Missouri in July, with operational control along a portion of the Mississippi River. He had an uncomfortable relationship with Frémont and politicked behind the scenes to get him removed from command. Frémont was convinced that Pope had treacherous intentions toward him, demonstrated by his lack of action in following Frémont's offensive plans in Missouri. Historian Allan Nevins wrote, \\"Actually, incompetence and timidity offer a better explanation of Pope than treachery, though he certainly showed an insubordinate spirit.\\"Nevins, p. 378. Pope eventually forced the Confederates under Sterling Price to retreat southward, taking 1,200 prisoners in a minor action at Blackwater, Missouri, on December 18. Pope, who established a reputation as a braggart early in the war, was able to generate significant press interest in his minor victory, which brought him to the attention of Frémont's replacement, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck. Halleck appointed Pope to command the Army of the Mississippi (and the District of the Mississippi, Department of the Missouri) on February 23, 1862. Given 25,000 men, he was ordered to clear Confederate obstacles on the Mississippi River. He made a surprise march on New Madrid, Missouri, and captured it on March 14. He then orchestrated a campaign to capture Island No. 10, a strongly fortified post garrisoned by 12,000 men and 58 guns. Pope's engineers cut a channel that allowed him to bypass the island. Assisted by the gunboats of Captain Andrew H. Foote, he landed his men on the opposite shore, which isolated the defenders. The island garrison surrendered on April 7, 1862, freeing Union navigation of the Mississippi as far south as Memphis. Pope's outstanding performance on the Mississippi earned him a promotion to major general, dated as of March 21, 1862. During the Siege of Corinth, he commanded the left wing of Halleck's army, but he was soon summoned to the East by Lincoln. After the collapse of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, Pope was appointed to command the Army of Virginia, assembled from scattered forces in the Shenandoah Valley and Northern Virginia. This promotion infuriated Frémont, who resigned his commission. Pope brought an attitude of self-assurance that was offensive to the eastern soldiers under his command. He issued an astonishing message to his new army on July 14, 1862, that included the following:Hennessy, p. 11. Major General John Pope Despite this bravado, and despite receiving units from McClellan's Army of the Potomac that swelled the Army of Virginia to 70,000 men, Pope's aggressiveness exceeded his strategic capabilities, particularly since he was now facing Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Lee, sensing that Pope was indecisive, split his smaller (55,000 man) army, sending Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson with 24,000 men as a diversion to Cedar Mountain, where Jackson defeated Pope's subordinate, Nathaniel Banks. As Lee advanced on Pope with the remainder of his army, Jackson swung around to the north and captured Pope's main supply base at Manassas Station. Confused and unable to locate the main Confederate force, Pope walked into a trap in the Second Battle of Bull Run. His men withstood a combined attack by Jackson and Lee on August 29, 1862, but on the following day Maj. Gen. James Longstreet launched a surprise flanking attack and the Union Army was soundly defeated and forced to retreat. Pope compounded his unpopularity with the Army by blaming his defeat on disobedience by Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter, who was found guilty by court- martial and disgraced. Brigadier General Alpheus S. Williams, who served briefly under Pope, held the general in particularly low esteem. In a letter to his daughter, he wrote: Pope himself was relieved of command on September 12, 1862, and his army was merged into the Army of the Potomac under McClellan. He spent the remainder of the war in the Department of the Northwest in Minnesota, dealing with the Dakota War of 1862. His months campaigning in the West paid career dividends because he was assigned to command the Military Division of the Missouri on January 30, 1865, and received a brevet promotion to major general in the regular army on March 13, 1865, for his service at Island No. 10. On June 27, 1865, the War Department issued General Order No. 118 dividing the entire United States, including the states formerly a part of the Confederacy, into five military divisions and 19 subordinate geographical departments. Major General William T. Sherman was assigned to command the Division of the Missouri. Pope then became commander of its Department of the Missouri, replacing Major General Grenville M. Dodge. Shortly after Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, Pope wrote a letter to Edmund Kirby-Smith offering the Confederates in Louisiana the same surrender terms that Grant allowed for Lee. He told Kirby-Smith that further resistance was futile and urged the general to avoid needless bloodshed, devastation, and misery by accepting the surrender terms. Kirby-Smith, however, rejected Pope's overtures and said that his army remained \\"strong and well equipped and that despite the 'disparity of numbers' his men could outweigh the differences 'by valor and skill'.\\" Five weeks later Confederate General Simon Bolivar Buckner signed the surrender in New Orleans.Winters, pp. 421, 426. Postbellum years In April 1867, Pope was named governor of the Reconstruction Third Military District and made his headquarters in Atlanta, issuing orders that allowed African Americans to serve on juries, ordering Mayor James Williams to remain in office another year, postponing elections, and banning city advertising in newspapers that did not favor Reconstruction. President Andrew Johnson removed him from command December 28, 1867, replacing him with George G. Meade.Atlanta city directory website, timeline of Atlanta history. Following this, Pope was appointed head of the Department of the Lakes (based in Detroit, Michigan) from January 13, 1868, to April 30, 1870.http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Pope_John_1822-1892 Pope returned to the West as commander of the Department of the Missouri (the nation's second largest geographical command) during the Grant presidency, and held that command through 1883. He served with distinction in the Apache Wars, including the Red River War relocating Southern Plains tribes to reservations in Oklahoma. General Pope made political enemies in Washington when he recommended that the reservation system would be better administered by the military than the corrupt Indian Bureau. He also engendered controversy by calling for better and more humane treatment of Native Americans, but author Walter Donald Kennedy notes that he also said \\"It is my purpose to utterly exterminate the Sioux\\" and planned to make a \\"final settlement with all these Indians\\".O.R., Series I, Vol. XIII, p. 686. Pope's reputation suffered a serious blow in 1879 when a late-convened Board of Inquiry called by President Rutherford B. Hayes and led by Maj. Gen. John Schofield (Pope's immediate predecessor in the Department of the Missouri and then head of the Department of the Pacific) concluded that Major General Fitz John Porter had been unfairly convicted of cowardice and disobedience at the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Schofield report used evidence of former Confederate commanders and concluded that Pope himself bore most of the responsibility for the Union loss. The report characterized Pope as reckless and dangerously uninformed about events during the battle, also criticized General Irvin McDowell (whom Pope detested), and credited Porter's perceived disobedience with saving the Union army from complete ruin. Pope was promoted to major general in the Regular Army in 1882 and was assigned to command of the Military Division of the Pacific in 1883 where he served until his retirement.Marquis Who's Who, Inc. Who Was Who in American History, the Military. Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1975. P. 488 Death and legacy Pope retired as a major general in the Regular Army on March 16, 1886, and his wife, Clara Pope, died two years later.

Following the foundation of the FA Premier League, the Football League divisions were renumbered and the third tier became known as the Football League Second Division. After the rebranding of the Football League in 2003–04, it became known as Football League One. Early history In 1888, Scotsman William McGregor a director of Aston Villa, was the main force between meetings held in London and Manchester involving 12 football clubs, with an eye to a league competition. These 12 clubs would later become the Football League's 12 founder members. The meetings were held in London on 22 March 1888. The main concern was that an early exit in the knockout format of the FA Cup could leave clubs with no matches for almost a year; not only could they suffer heavy financial losses, but fans did not wait long without a game, when other teams were playing. Matters were finalised on 17 April in Manchester. McGregor had voted against the name The Football League, as he was concerned that it would be associated with the Irish Land League.\\"A History of Football\\", p.22 But this name still won by a majority vote and was selected. The competition guaranteed fixtures for all of its member clubs. Geographically, these were split equally between the North and the Midlands. A rival English league called the Football Alliance operated from 1889 to 1892. In 1892 it was decided to formally merge the two leagues, and so the Football League Second Division was formed, consisting mostly of Football Alliance clubs. The existing League clubs, plus three of the strongest Alliance clubs, comprised the Football League First Division. Overview The Second Division was formed in 1892 with 12 clubs, most of which had previously played in the Football Alliance. The original members were: Ardwick (now Manchester City), Bootle, Burton Swifts, Crewe Alexandra, Darwen, Grimsby Town, Lincoln City, Northwich Victoria, Port Vale, Sheffield United, Small Heath (now Birmingham City), and Walsall. Manchester City and Leicester City jointly hold the record for most second tier championships (7). It expanded over the years to its final total of 24 clubs, as follows: * 1893 – 15 clubs * 1894 – 16 * 1898 – 18 * 1905 – 20 * 1919 – 22 * 1987 – 23 * 1988 – 24 For the first few years, there was no automatic promotion to the First Division. Instead, the top few teams in Division Two, including the winners, contested a series of test matches against the bottom teams in Division One. Small Heath, Second Division champions in 1892–93, were denied promotion after losing in test matches to Newton Heath. However, runners-up Sheffield United beat Accrington to become the first team to win promotion to the First Division. Test matches were abolished in 1898 after Burnley and Stoke conspired to deliberately draw their test match 0–0, which resulted in Burnley being promoted and Stoke being saved from relegation. Relegation to the Football League Third Division was in place in the season before the latter even started, as Grimsby Town (last place in 1919–20) made way for Cardiff City and formed the new Third Division with southern clubs. For subsequent seasons, two clubs were relegated into either the Third Division North or Third Division South depending on their geographical location. When the Third Division was reunified in 1958–59, the relegation arrangement was kept; a third club began being relegated in 1974.

Education Michael Scammell was born in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, England, attended Brockenhurst Grammar School, and after two years working as a copy boy for the Southern Daily Echo in Southampton, was drafted into the British army, spending most of his time at the Joint Services School for Linguists in Cambridge and Bodmin, where he was trained as a Russian interpreter. In 1958 he earned a B.A. degree with first class honors in Slavic Studies from the University of Nottingham, and edited the prize-winning student newspaper, The Gongster. Having spent a year teaching English at the University of Ljubljana in the former Yugoslavia, he attended graduate school at Columbia University and later obtained his doctorate in Slavic Studies. Career Translations While in graduate school, Scammell taught Russian Literature at Hunter College and began translating books from Russian. His first translation was a novel, Cities and Years, by the Soviet author, Konstantin Fedin. Having been introduced to Vladimir Nabokov, he translated two of Nabokov's Russian novels into English, The Gift and The Defense, followed by a translation of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. After moving back to England in 1965, Scammell translated Childhood, Boyhood and Youth by Lev Tolstoy and a detective novel, Petrovka 38, by the Soviet author, Yulian Semyonov. Two years later he joined the External Services division of the BBC as a Language Supervisor for East European Languages, and after becoming interested in the plight of Russian dissidents, translated a memoir about the post-Stalin gulag, My Testimony, by a former prisoner, Anatoly Marchenko. Together with the Slovenian poet, Veno Taufer, whom he met at the BBC, he also translated a selection of modern Slovenian poetry for a special issue of Modern Poetry in Translation. Many years later, he and Taufer translated a selection of poems by Slovenia's premier modern poet, Edvard Kocbek, under the title, “Nothing Is Lost.” Index on Censorship Philip Spender, Jo Glanville, Michael Scammell in Prague (2010) In 1971, Scammell became the first director of the nonprofit Writers and Scholars International (later the Writers and Scholars Educational Trust) in London, and started the quarterly magazine, Index on Censorship, devoted to documenting censorship worldwide and promoting freedom of expression. In 1976 he was asked to revive the International PEN Club's moribund Writers in Prison Committee and remained Chair for the next ten years. For the next few years, he edited and partly translated an anthology of censored writing, Russia's Other Writers; edited an illustrated catalog, \\"Unofficial Art from the Soviet Union\\" to accompany an exhibition of paintings and sculpture he helped to organize under the same name; translated To Build a Castle by Vladimir Bukovsky; edited and supervised the translation of a set of cultural and political essays selected by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, From Under the Rubble; vetted the American translation of the first two volumes of The Gulag Archipelago by Solzhenitsyn; and arranged for the translation and publication of Solzhenitsyn's pamphlet, Letter to the Soviet Leaders, written shortly before the latter's expulsion from the Soviet Union. Biographies Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (photographed in 1974) was the subject of Scammell's first biography After meeting Solzhenitsyn in Zurich and Frankfurt, Scammell undertook to write Solzhenitsyn's biography (with the author's consent and cooperation, but without his authorization) and resigned from Index on Censorship to work on it full-time. Between 1981 and 1983 he lived in New York, chaired a seminar on censorship at New York University, ran an exchange program with Eastern Europe funded by George Soros, and attended weekly meetings of the New York Institute for the Humanities. Returning to England, he completed and published Solzhenitsyn, A Biography (1984). Arthur Koestler (photographed in 1969) is the subject of Scammell's second biography Scammell was commissioned to write the authorized biography of Arthur Koestler, which after fifteen years of research and writing was published in the United States in 2009 as Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth Century Skeptic, and in the UK in 2010 as Koestler, The Indispensable Intellectual. The book won the PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for the best biography of 2009 in the United States and the Spears Magazine Award for best biography of 2010 in the UK. It was also shortlisted for the 2010 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for biography. The New York Times Book Review listed it as one of the “100 Best Books of 2010.” In 2016, Scammell reported the discovery by German doctoral candidate Matthias Weßel of the original German version of Koestler's Darkness at Noon. A Swiss university had archived it under the title \\"Koestler, Arthur. Rubaschow: Roman. Typoskript, März 1940, 326 pages.\\" He deemed the discovery important because \\"Darkness at Noon is that rare specimen, a book known to the world only in translation.\\" In 2018, he reported that Elsinor Verlag (publisher of the 1946 German translation) had published the German original, as Sonnenfinsternis (Solar Eclipse) in May 2018, with an introduction by Scammell and an afterword by Weßel. He also reported a new English translation to appear in 2019, with a different introduction and appendices. In August 2019, Scammell mentioned the new German original in the New York Times but made no reference to the forthcoming English translation or its publication date. Academics In 1985, Scammell returned to the United States to settle there permanently. From 1986–1994 he was a Professor of Russian Literature at Cornell University, and in 1994 moved to Columbia University to become Professor of Writing (Nonfiction) and Translation. He retired from Columbia at the end of 2011. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a vice president of International PEN. He has received fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Program, the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Ford Foundation, the Leverhulme Trust, the Jerusalem Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Historical Research Foundation. Personal life Scammell is married to Rosemary Nossiff, a professor of Political Science at Marymount Manhattan College and previously a professor at Rutgers University. He was previously married to Erika Roettges, with whom he has four children, Catherine, Stephen, Lesley and Ingrid.

The mission began July 28, 1973, with the launch of three astronauts in the Apollo command and service module on the Saturn IB rocket, and lasted 59 days, 11 hours and 9 minutes. A total of 1,084.7 astronaut-utilization hours were tallied by the Skylab 3 crew performing scientific experiments in the areas of medical activities, solar observations, Earth resources, and other experiments. The crewed Skylab missions were officially designated Skylab 2, 3, and 4. Mis-communication about the numbering resulted in the mission emblems reading \\"Skylab I\\", \\"Skylab II\\", and \\"Skylab 3\\" respectively. Crew Backup crew Support crew *Robert L.

On the right an image of the Sun shows a helium emissions, and there is an image on the left showing emissions from iron While approaching Skylab a propellant leak developed in one of the Apollo Service Module's reaction control system thruster quads. The crew was able to safely dock with the station, but troubleshooting continued with the problem. Six days later, another thruster quad developed a leak, creating concern amongst Mission Control. For the first time, an Apollo spacecraft was rolled out to Launch Complex 39 for Skylab Rescue, made possible by the ability for the station to have two Apollo CSMs docked at the same time. It was eventually determined that the CSM could be safely maneuvered using only two working thruster quads, and the rescue mission was never launched. After recovering from space sickness the crew, during their first EVA, installed the twin-pole sunshade, one of the two solutions for the destruction of the micrometeoroid shield during Skylab's launch to keep the space station cool. It was installed over the parasol, which was originally deployed through a porthole airlock during Skylab 2. Both were brought to the station by Skylab 2. Skylab 3 continued a comprehensive medical research program that extended the data on human physiological adaptation and readaptation to space flight collected on the previous Skylab 2 mission. In addition, Skylab 3 extended the astronauts' stay in space from approximately one month to two months. Therefore, the effects of flight duration on physiological adaptation and readaptation could be examined. A set of core medical investigations were performed on all three Skylab crewed missions. These core investigations were the same basic investigations that were performed on Skylab 2, except that the Skylab 3 inflight tests were supplemented with extra tests based on what researchers learned from the Skylab 2 science results. For example, only leg volume measurements, preflight and postflight stereophotogrammetry, and in-flight maximum calf girth measurements were originally scheduled for all three Skylab missions. In-flight photographs from Skylab 2 revealed the \\"puffy face syndrome\\" which prompted the addition of in-flight torso and limb girth measurements to gather more data on the apparent headward fluid shift on Skylab 3. Other additional tests included arterial blood flow measurements by an occlusive cuff placed around the leg, facial photographs taken before flight and during flight to study the \\"puffy face syndrome\\", venous compliance, hemoglobin, urine specific gravity, and urine mass measurements. These inflight tests gave additional information about fluid distribution and fluid balance to get a better understanding of the fluid shift phenomena. The Skylab 3 biological experiments studied the effects of microgravity on mice, fruit flies, single cells and cell culture media. Human lung cells were flown to examine the biochemical characteristics of cell cultures in the microgravity environment. The two animal experiments were entitled Chronobiology of Pocket Mice and Circadian Rhythm in Vinegar Gnats. Both experiments were unsuccessful due to a power failure 30 hours after launch, which killed the animals. High school students from across the United States participated in the Skylab missions as the primary investigators of experiments that studied astronomy, physics, and fundamental biology. The student experiments performed on Skylab 3 included the study of libration clouds, X-rays from Jupiter, in-vitro immunology, spider web formation, cytoplasmic streaming, mass measurement, and neutron analysis. The crew's health was assessed on Skylab by collecting data on dental health, environmental and crew microbiology, radiation, and toxicological aspects of the Skylab orbital workshop. Other assessments were made of astronaut maneuvering equipment and of the habitability of the crew quarters, and crew activities/maintenance experiments were examined on Skylab 2 through 4 to better understand the living and working aspects of life in space. S150 Galactic X-Ray Mapping S150 instrument for galactic X-Ray mapping, sent up with Skylab 3 The S150 X-ray experiment was sent up with Skylab 3. The 1,360 kg X-ray astronomy satellite experiment was designed to look for soft galactic x-rays. Short missions had been done before, and S150 would be a longer project. S150 had a large soft x-ray detector, and was mounted atop the Saturn S-IVB upper stage. When released, S150 flew behind and below Skylab on 28 July 1973. The S150 experiment deployed after the Apollo capsule separated from the S-IVB stage. S150 had its own protective housing for the flight. The experiment on S150 ran for 5 hours, as its batteries allowed S150 to measure half of the sky. Experiment data was recorded on tape-recorder and sent to ground stations when available. S150 was designed by University of Wisconsin scientists Dr. William L. Kraushaar and Alan Bunner. S150 could detect 40-100 angstrom photons.

A receptor potential is often produced by sensory transduction. It is generally a depolarizing event resulting from inward current flow. The influx of current will often bring the membrane potential of the sensory receptor towards the threshold for triggering an action potential. Receptor potential can work to trigger an action potential either within the same neuron or on an adjacent cell. Within the same neuron, a receptor potential can cause local current to flow to a region capable of generating an action potential by opening voltage gated ion channels. A receptor potential can also cause the release of neurotransmitters from one cell that will act on another cell, generating an action potential in the second cell. The magnitude of the receptor potential determines the frequency with which action potentials are generated, and is controlled by adaption, stimulus strength, and temporal summation of successive receptor potentials. Receptor potential relies on receptor sensitivity which can adapt slowly, resulting in a slowly decaying receptor potential or rapidly, resulting in a quickly generated but shorter lasting receptor potential. An example of a receptor potential is in a taste bud, where taste is converted into an electrical signal sent to the brain. When stimulated, the taste bud triggers the release of neurotransmitter through exocytosis of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic membrane of the primary sensory neuron, where they elicit an action potential.

The optic tract that extends from the optic nerve is an example of a neural pathway because it connects the eye to the brain; additional pathways within the brain connect to the visual cortex. A neural pathway is the connection formed by axons that project from neurons to make synapses onto neurons in another location, to enable a signal to be sent from one region of the nervous system to another. Neurons are connected by a single axon, or by a bundle of axons known as a nerve tract, or fasciculus. Shorter neural pathways are found within grey matter in the brain, whereas longer projections, made up of myelinated axons, constitute white matter. In the hippocampus there are neural pathways involved in its circuitry including the perforant pathway, that provides a connectional route from the entorhinal cortex to all fields of the hippocampal formation, including the dentate gyrus, all CA fields (including CA1), and the subiculum. Descending motor pathways of the pyramidal tracts travel from the cerebral cortex to the brainstem or lower spinal cord. Ascending sensory tracts in the dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway (DCML) carry information from the periphery to the cortex of the brain. Naming cerebellar cortex Pathways in the ciliary ganglion. Green=Parasympathetic; Red=Sympathetic; Blue=Sensory The first named pathways are evident to the naked eye even in a poorly preserved brain, and were named by the great anatomists of the Renaissance using cadaver material. Examples of these include the great commissures of the brain such as the corpus callosum (Latin, \\"hard body\\"; not to be confused with the Latin word \\"colossus\\" the \\"huge\\" statue), anterior commissure, and posterior commissure. Further examples include the pyramidal tract, crus cerebri (Latin, \\"leg of the brain\\"), and cerebellar peduncles (Latin, \\"little foot of the cerebellum\\"). Note that these names describe the appearance of a structure but give no information on its function, location, etc. Later, as neuroanatomical knowledge became more sophisticated, the trend was toward naming pathways by their origin and termination. For example, the nigrostriatal pathway runs from the substantia nigra (Latin, \\"black substance\\") to the corpus striatum (Latin, \\"striped body\\"). This naming can extend to include any number of structures in a pathway, such that the cerebellorubrothalamocortical pathway originates in the cerebellum, synapses in the red nucleus (\\"ruber\\" in Latin), on to the thalamus, and finally terminating in the cerebral cortex. Sometimes, these two naming conventions coexist. For example, the name \\"pyramidal tract\\" has been mainly supplanted by lateral corticospinal tract in most texts. Note that the \\"old\\" name was primarily descriptive, evoking the pyramids of antiquity, from the appearance of this neural pathway in the medulla oblongata. The \\"new\\" name is based primarily on its origin (in the primary motor cortex, Brodmann area 4) and termination (onto the alpha motor neurons of the spinal cord). In the cerebellum one of the two major pathways is that of the mossy fibers. Mossy fibers project directly to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. The other main pathway is from the climbing fibers and these project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals directly to the deep nuclei. Functional aspects Diagram showing cortical pathways In general, neurons receive information either at their dendrites or cell bodies. The axon of a nerve cell is, in general, responsible for transmitting information over a relatively long distance. Therefore, most neural pathways are made up of axons. If the axons have myelin sheaths, then the pathway appears bright white because myelin is primarily lipid. If most or all of the axons lack myelin sheaths (i.e., are unmyelinated), then the pathway will appear a darker beige color, which is generally called grey. Some neurons are responsible for conveying information over long distances. For example, motor neurons, which travel from the spinal cord to the muscle, can have axons up to a meter in length in humans. The longest axon in the human body belongs to the Sciatic Nerve and runs from the great toe to the base of the spinal cord. These are archetypal examples of neural pathways. Basal ganglia pathways and dopamine Neural pathways in the basal ganglia in the cortico-basal ganglia- thalamo-cortical loop, are seen as controlling different aspects of behaviour. This regulation is enabled by the dopamine pathways. It has been proposed that the dopamine system of pathways is the overall organiser of the neural pathways that are seen to be parallels of the dopamine pathways. Dopamine is provided both tonically and phasically in response to the needs of the neural pathways.

Introduced in 1975, it was the first Japanese- designed aircraft to break the sound barrier. It was the basis of the Mitsubishi F-1 military aircraft. All T-2s were retired by 2006. Development Post-World War II rendered Japan without a modern jet fighter for defensive purposes. Two decades after World War II had concluded, Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) began to consider the development of a supersonic jet tentatively named \\"T-X.\\" Japan had found that the subsonic Fuji T-1 jet trainer did not adequately prepare trainee pilots for more complex and difficult handling front line Mach 2 fighters such as the Lockheed F-104J Starfighter and McDonnell Douglas F-4EJ Phantom and so, in 1964–65, began studies for a new trainer, the T-X, which it was hoped would also form the basis for a future single-seat attack aircraft, the SF-X.Lake 1994, p. 138. Consideration was also given to acquiring existing foreign aircraft instead of developing a new aircraft, with the United States offering the Northrop T-38 Talon, and the Anglo/French consortium SEPECAT offering the SEPECAT Jaguar as a trainer and single-seat fighter. Japan considered both aircraft carefully, and attempted to negotiate licensed production of the Jaguar,Lake 1994, p. 139. but these plans failed, possibly due to nationalism and an issue with the Imperial family,Goebel, Greg. \\"The Mitsubishi T-2 / F-1 & Kawasaki T-4.\\" Air Vectors, 1 July 2009. Retrieved: 11 October 2009. or more prosaically, due to the high royalty payments demanded by SEPECAT. In the end, Japan decided to manufacture its own design, which, produced to meet similar requirements, would closely resemble the Jaguar. In 1967, Japanese aviation firms Fuji, Kawasaki, and Mitsubishi, each submitted proposals, and in September 1967, under lead designer Dr. Kenji Ikeda, Mitsubishi's design was selected. The official contract was issued for the development of the XT-2 was placed on 30 March 1968, with Mitsubishi as prime contractor and Fuji as Prime sub- contractor. Several other subcontracts with aerospace firms and other minor aviation manufacturers were also established.Lake 1994, p. 140. By March 1969, the design had been finalized, and the XT-2 prototype was rolled out on 28 April 1971, and performed its maiden flight on 20 July 1971. The XT-2 was followed by three more prototypes, and became the first aircraft of Japanese design to break the sound barrier in level flight. Two of the four prototypes were armed, and the other two were not.Lake 1994, p. 145.Taylor 1976, p. 129. A total of 90 production T-2s were built, including 28 unarmed \\"T-2(Z)s\\", or \\"Zenkigata (early type)\\" and 62 armed \\"T-2(K)s\\", or \\"Kokigata (late type)\\"; some sources translate these variants as \\"T-2A\\" and \\"T-2B\\" respectively. An additional two T-2(Z)s were built but modified for the S-FX / F-1 strike fighter program. The last T-2 rolled off the assembly line in 1988.Lake 1994, pp. 146–147. Design The T-2's configuration was clearly reminiscent of that of the two-seat Jaguar, with the two aircraft having the same overall configuration and some resemblance in details. In particular, the T-2 was also powered by two Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour turbofans, the same engine type used by the Jaguar, license-built by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries under the designation \\"TF40-IHI-801A\\". Despite this similarity, the T-2 was not a copy of the Jaguar, and the two aircraft could be distinguished at a glance, the T-2 having a more dartlike appearance, being noticeably longer and having a distinctly shorter wingspan than the Jaguar. The T-2 also had many detail differences. For example, since the JASDF had no rough-field requirement, the T-2 had conventional single-wheeled landing gear and not the distinctive heavy duty landing gear of the Jaguar.Lake 1994, pp. 144–145. The T-2 was made mostly of aircraft aluminum alloys, though it featured selective use of titanium. The high-mounted wings had a leading edge sweep of 42.5° and a 9° anhedral. The wings feature noticeable \\"leading edge root extensions (LERX)\\" and full-span leading edge slats, with a \\"dogtooth\\" discontinuity on the outer edge of the span, though the dogtooth did not split the slat. There was a single ¾-span flap on the trailing edge, unlike the full-span double- slotted split flaps of the Jaguar, but the T-2 did have twin spoilers on each wing just forward of the flap for roll control instead of ailerons, another element clearly derived from the Jaguar. There was a small fence mounted inboard on the top of the wing. There were no fuel tanks in the wings.Lake 1994, pp. 141–145. The tail assembly was conventional, featuring slab all- moving tailplanes with an anhedral of 15°. The steep anhedral kept the tailplanes out of the engine exhaust while allowing them to remain effective through the wing wash. Like the Jaguar, there was a fixed ventral fin under each exhaust, while two hydraulically operated airbrakes are fitted just forward of each ventral fin. Each Adour engine provided 22.75 kN (5,115 lbf) max dry thrust and 32.49 kN (7,305 lbf) afterburning thrust. The TF40-801As did not have the \\"part throttle reheat\\" feature added to Adour 102s as an engine-out safety feature, and the T-2 was never refitted with more powerful Adour engine variants, along the lines of the Adour 104 eventually refitted to British Jaguars, leaving the T-2 somewhat underpowered. The engine intakes had fixed rectangular geometry and fuselage splitter plates, plus a set of spring- loaded auxiliary inlets behind the intake lip for increased airflow in ground running. There were large service doors beneath the fuselage that provided excellent access to the engines for maintenance. The T-2's tricycle landing gear all featured single wheels, with the nose gear retracting backward and the main gear retracting forward into the fuselage, rotating 90° to lie flat, and incorporated an antiskid control system.Lake 1994, pp. 144–145. The nose gear was offset slightly to the right, with a small fixed vertical airfoil mounted in front of it to compensate for the extended nose gear's tendency to cause yaw.Lake 1994, pp. 145–146. A runway arresting hook was fitted under the tail behind the engine exhausts.Lake 1994, p. 141. Crew and safety The crew sat in tandem, with the flight instructor sitting behind the student on a raised seat to give a good forward view. There was a windblast screen between the two cockpits. The aircrew sat under separate clamshell canopies on Weber ES-7J zero-zero (zero altitude, zero speed) ejection seats, built by Daiseru.Michell 1994, p. 128. The seats featured specially modified canopy penetrators to ensure safe ejection even if the canopy wasn't blown off. The seats also dispensed a cloud of radar-reflecting \\"chaff\\" on ejection to allow ground controllers to spot where the ejection occurred and direct search and rescue teams to the proper area. Radar and radio system Standard equipment for the armed T-2(K) included a Mitsubishi Electric J/AWG-11 search and ranging radar in the nose; a French Thomson-CSF heads-up display (HUD), license-built by Mitsubishi Electric; a Lear-Siegler 501OBL automatic heading and reference system (AHRS); as well as a UHF radio, an identification friend or foe (IFF) system, and a TACAN radio beacon navigation receiver system, all built in Japan. The J/AWG-11 was basically a member of the family of radars fitted to the U.S. F-4 Phantom, being very similar to the AN/AWG-11 fitted to the British Royal Navy Phantom FG.1. The unarmed T-2(Z) lacked the radar,Lake 1994, p. 144. though apparently its avionics kit was otherwise the same as that of the T-2(K). Operational history Mitsubishi T-2s of the Blue Impulse air display team The XT-2 was redesignated T-2 on 29 August 1973, entering service in 1975, with the first unit, the 21st Hikōtai becoming fully operational on 1 October 1976, with a second squadron, the 22nd Hikōtai following on 5 April 1978, allowing the North American F-86 Sabre to be phased out of the advanced training role. The \\"Blue Impulse\\" aerobatic display team of the JASDF re-equipped with the T-2 in the winter of 1981–82. T-2s were also used by a dedicated Aggressor squadron, being replaced by the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. T-2s were also used as conversion trainers for squadrons operating the Mitsubishi F-1, a development of the T-2.Lake 1994, p. 147. The T-2 was retired by 2006, being replaced as an advanced trainer by the Kawasaki T-4 and as a conversion trainer by a two-seat version of the Mitsubishi F-2, which had replaced the F-1 in the anti-ship strike/ground attack role.

They are often called pyramids, due to their tendency to split into an increasing number of regional divisions further down the system. League systems of some sort are used in many sports in many countries. In association football, rugby union, rugby league and Gaelic games, league systems are usually connected by the process of promotion and relegation, in which teams from a lower division who finish at the top of the standings in their league are promoted (advanced to the next level of the system) while teams who finish lowest in their division are relegated (move down to a lower division). This process can be automatic each year, or can require playoffs. In North America, league systems in the most popular sports do not use promotion or relegation. Most professional sports are divided into major and minor leagues. Baseball and association football (known as soccer in North America) have well-defined pyramid shapes to their minor league hierarchies, each managed by a governing body (Minor League Baseball, an organization under the authority of the Commissioner of Baseball, governs baseball leagues; the United States Soccer Federation designates the American soccer pyramid.) Ice hockey's professional minor league system is linear, with one league at most of the four levels of the game; the ice hockey league system in North America is governed by collective bargaining agreements and affiliation deals between the NHL, AHL and ECHL. Gridiron football does not operate on a league system. Different professional leagues play by very different sets of rules in different seasons (the NFL plays 11-a-side on a 100-yard field in autumn and early winter, the CFL uses 12-a-side on a 110-yard field in summer and early fall, while arena football and the minor indoor leagues each play 8-a-side on a 50-yard field in the spring and early summer). There have been attempts at forming true minor leagues for the professional game (most recently with 2019's Alliance of American Football); none so far have been able to balance the major leagues' requests with the ability to maintain financial solvency.

The sobriquet, coined in the mid-1960s, was invoked by music magazines in the 1960s such as Life who used it for the Righteous Brothers (album Soul and Inspiration for Verve Records), Barry McGuire, Sonny & Cher; other times it meant style and mannerisms associated with soul music by White musicians.Hughes, Zondra \\"Are Whites Stealing Rhythm & Blues?\\" Ebony Magazine, Vol. 55, Johnson Publishing Company, p. 72, ISSN 0012-9011.Desmond, William (2018). The Gift of Beauty and the Passion of Being: On the Threshold between the Aesthetic and the Religious, Wipf and Stock Publishers, p. 146, . Though many rhythm and blues radio stations in the United States in that period would only play music by black musicians, some began to play music by white acts considered to have \\"soul feeling\\" and their music was then described as \\"blue- eyed soul.\\" 1960s The Righteous Brothers, one of the early artists most closely associated with blue-eyed soul Georgie Woods, a Philadelphia radio DJ, is thought to have coined the term \\"blue-eyed soul\\" in 1964, initially to describe The Righteous Brothers, then white artists in general who received airplay on rhythm and blues radio stations. The Righteous Brothers in turn named their 1964 LP Some Blue-Eyed Soul. According to Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers, R&B; radio stations who played their songs were surprised to find them to be white when they turned up for interviews, and one DJ in Philadelphia (unnamed by Medley but probably Georgie Woods) started saying \\"Here's my blue-eyed soul brothers\\", and it became a code to signal to the audience that they were white singers. The popularity of The Righteous Brothers who had a hit with \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\" is thought to have started the trend of R&B; radio stations to play songs by white artists in the mid-1960s, a more integrative approach that was then popular with their audience. The term blue-eyed soul was then applied to such artists as Sonny & Cher, The Beatles, Tom Jones, Barry McGuire, and Roy Head. White musicians playing R&B; music, however, began before the term blue-eyed soul was coined. For instance, in the early 1960s, one of the rare female blue-eyed soul singers was Timi Yuro, whose vocal delivery and repertoire were influenced by African American singers such as Dinah Washington.Bob Dickinson, Timi Yuro: Feisty white singer with a black soul voice, The Guardian, 10 April 2004. Retrieved 21 November 2015 Steve Winwood performing with Traffic, 1969 Lonnie Mack's 1963 gospel-infused vocals earned him widespread critical acclaim as a blue-eyed soul singer.Alec Dubrow, Rolling Stone, November 23, 1968) Quote: \\"It is truly the voice of Lonnie Mack that sets him apart. He is primarily a gospel singer, and in a way not too different from, say, Elvis, whose gospel works are both great and largely unnoticed. Lonnie's songs have a sincerity and intensity that's hard to find anywhere.\\" See also, Bill Millar (1983). \\"Blue-eyed Soul: Colour Me Soul\\". The History of Rock. Archived from the original on 2007-11-22. Retrieved 2007-11-14: \\"Lonnie Mack wailed a soul ballad as gutsily as any black gospel singer. The anguished inflections which stamped his best songs (\\"Why?\\", \\"She Don't Come Here Anymore\\" and \\"Where There's a Will\\") had a directness which would have been wholly embarrassing in the hands of almost any other white vocalist.\\" Groups such as The Rascals had soul-tinged pop songs, but it was the soulful vocals of Felix Cavaliere that gave them the blue-eyed soul sound. By the mid-1960s, British singers Dusty Springfield, Eric Burdon, and Tom Jones had become leading vocal stars of the emerging style. Other notable UK exponents of blue-eyed soul included The Spencer Davis Group (featuring Steve Winwood), Van Morrison, and archetypal mod band The Small Faces, whose sound was heavily influenced by the Stax label's house band Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Blonde, blue-eyed soul singer Chris Clark became the first white singer to have an R&B; hit with \\"Love's Gone Bad\\" with Motown Records in 1966. In 1969, Kiki Dee became the first British artist to sign and record with Motown. Some British rock groups of the 1960s—such as the Spencer Davis Group, the Animals, the Rolling Stones (\\"My Girl\\"), and the Who (\\"Heat Wave\\")—covered Motown and rhythm and blues tracks. In 1967, Jerry Lee Lewis, whose latter days at Sun Records (1961–63) had been characterized by R&B; covers, recorded an album for Smash entitled Soul My Way. Delaney and Bonnie (Bramlett) produced the blue-eyed soul album Home on Stax in 1969. Michael Sembello, who left home at age 17 to tour with Stevie Wonder, wrote and performed on numerous blue-eyed soul hits for Wonder, Brian McKnight, David Sanborn, Bill Champlin, and Bobby Caldwell. Todd Rundgren began his career in Woody's Truck Stop, a group based on the model of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After splitting from Big Brother and the Holding Company, Janis Joplin formed a new backup group, the Kozmic Blues Band, composed of session musicians like keyboardist Stephen Ryder and saxophonist Cornelius \\"Snooky\\" Flowers, as well as former Big Brother and the Holding Company guitarist Sam Andrew and future Full Tilt Boogie Band bassist Brad Campbell. The band was influenced by the Stax-Volt rhythm and blues (R&B;) and soul bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays. 1970s Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds and the Grass Roots both had successful blue-eyed soul singles; the former with \\"Don't Pull Your Love\\" (1971) and the latter with \\"Two Divided by Love\\" (1971) and \\"The Runway\\" (1972). In 1973, the American band Stories and the Canadian group Skylark had successes with their respective blue-eyed soul singles \\"Brother Louie\\" and \\"Wildflower\\". In February 1975, Tower of Power became the first white/mixed act to appear on Soul Train. Also in 1975, David Bowie, another early white artist to appear on Soul Train, released Young Americans, a popular blue-eyed soul album which Bowie himself called \\"plastic soul\\".David Bowie Fell to Earth and Found His Plastic Soulon Young AmericansConsequence of Sound It featured the funk-inspired \\"Fame\\", which became Bowie's first number-one hit in the US. Hall & Oates' 1975 Silver Album (real title Daryl Hall & John Oates) includes the ballad \\"Sara Smile\\", long considered a blue-eyed soul standard. \\"She's Gone\\", another soulful hit, was originally released in 1973 but did better as a re-release after \\"Sara Smile\\". 1980s and later Duffy, Welsh soul artist Blue eyed soul music's chart success was at its highest when Hall and Oates' singles got heavy airplay on urban contemporary radio, as was the case with \\"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\\", \\"Kiss on My List\\", \\"One on One\\", \\"Say It Isn't So\\", \\"Adult Education\\", \\"Out of Touch\\", \\"Method of Modern Love\\" and \\"Everytime You Go Away\\". Most of those singles charted on the R&B; and dance charts, including some number-one hits. In 1985, Simply Red released \\"Holding Back the Years\\", one of the most successful blue-eyed soul ballads; \\"Money's Too Tight\\" and other singles by the group also performed well. Other successful blue-eyed soul songs of the 1980s include Phil Collins' cover of \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" (1982); Culture Club's \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\" (1982), \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\" (1982) and \\"Church of the Poison Mind\\" (1983); Dexys Midnight Runners' \\"Come On Eileen\\" (1983); the Style Council's \\"Shout to the Top\\" (1984); Teena Marie's \\"Lovergirl\\"(1985); Paul Young's \\"Every Time You Go Away\\" (1985); Eurythmics' \\"Missionary Man\\" (1986) and Steve Winwood's \\"Roll with It\\" (1988). As the decade drew to a close, British artist Lisa Stansfield had considerable success on R&B; radio, scoring three number- one R&B; hits, the most popular being \\"All Around the World\\". In the mid-1980s, George Michael found some success in the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs with hit singles such as \\"Careless Whisper\\" and \\"Everything She Wants\\" but it was not until he reinvented himself as a white soul singer with the release of his multi-platinum album Faith (1987).G. Wald, \\"Soul's Revival: White Soul, Nostalgia and the Culturally Constructed Past\\", in M. Guillory and R. C. Green, Soul: Black power, politics, and pleasure (New York University Press, 1997), pp. 139–58. The album was notable for entering the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart at number one, making it the first album by a white artist to hit the top spot on that chart, mainly due to the gospel-influenced singles that were released from the album, most notably \\"Father Figure\\" and \\"One More Try\\".DeepSoul: George Michael - \\"One More Try\\" - Blinded by Sound In 1989, he racked up three wins in the American Music Awards including Favorite Soul/R&B; Male Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B; Album for Faith. Scottish musician Paolo Nutini whose first two albums influenced by soul music are certified quintuple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. Criticism A backlash ensued in the late 1980s as some black people felt that white people were cashing in on the popularity of their music. However, the extent of the backlash was not universally agreed upon. In 1989, Ebony Magazine published an article exploring whether white people were \\"taking over\\" R&B.; The article featured various members of the music industry, both black and white, who believed collaboration was a unifying force, and there was agreement that the future of R&B; was not compromised by the contemporary urban sound. A similar article in Ebony, written in 1999 highlighted conflicting opinions about the \\"blue-eyed\\" influence; however, the source of contention was not about the artistic merit of blue-eyed soul, but rather the economic inequality that persisted in American life and within the music industry. According to scholar Joanna Teresa Demers, the \\"successors [of Presley] in blue-eyed soul and white funk\\" embittered poet Gil Scott-Heron as it proved that \\"blacks were still being victimized by cultural appropriation, making their contributions to American history virtually invisible and inaudible.\\" The \\"long tradition of white co- optation of black cultural identity\\" since Elvis amounting to \\"artistic theft\\" was, in Scott-Heron's words, \\"no new thing.\\" Daryl Hall has described the term \\"blue-eyed soul\\" as racist, saying \\"it assumes I’m coming from the outside. There’s always been that thing in America, where if you’re a white guy and you’re singing or playing in a black idiom, it’s like: ‘Why is he doing that? Is he from the outside, looking in? Is he copying? What’s the point of it?’ C’mon, it's music! It's music.\\" \\"Please, don’t categorize Hall and Oates this way: ‘It’s a racist term’\\", Something Else!, May 10, 2015.

It is accredited to bestow degrees up to the master's level.  History  Founded in 1842 as Bethel Seminary, it became Bethel College in 1847 and assumed its current name in 2009. Bethel University student enrollment as of Fall 2017 consisted of 4,579 students. On August 4, 2014, Bethel University and the Board of Trustees officially announced Dr. Walter Butler as its 40th president, a position he held on an interim basis since August 1, 2013 after longtime President Dr. Robert Prosser retired. In the 2010s, Bethel University began renovating and building new facilities to accommodate its rapidly growing enrollment numbers. On May 8, 2010, the university held a dedication service for its newest building, the Ray and Linda Morris Science Complex, featuring new laboratories, additional classrooms, and a lecture hall. Also dedicated that year was a new residence hall, University Hall, which houses up to 250 students. June the following year saw the reopening of the Odom Hall math building after extensive renovations, along with Heritage Hall, a new three-story residence hall which was dedicated in August 2011. The university's most ambitious construction plan also saw its first of four phases completed in August 2011. Phase I of the Vera Low Center for Student Enrichment features a new cafeteria, student services offices, bookstore, enrollment offices and a student activities room. Phase II of the Rosemary and Harry L. Crisp Arena, which opened in Spring 2012, consists of a new gymnasium, athletic training facilities, offices, and a fitness center for students, faculty, and general public. Phase III, the Cumberland Chapel, was under construction . In conjunction with the Henry County Medical Center, in November 2012, Bethel University opened its new satellite campus for the Physician Assistant Program along with the medical centers' new Diagnostic Center.  Student body  The bulk of students attending Bethel University are residents of Tennessee, but the school does take students from other states and countries. Each year, two international students are chosen to receive the Honors Scholarship for International Students which includes full tuition, room, meals, and all fees.  Academics  Bethel University consists of three colleges: the College of Arts & Sciences, the College of Professional Studies, and the College of Health Sciences. The University offers Associates, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Arts, Master of Business Administration, and Master of Science degrees through a variety of academic programs. Since 1988, it has hosted the two-day academically-based Hendrix Scholarship Competition offering full tuition and board for the winner, with full tuition for the runner up. Students who qualify may enter the Honors program, receiving a $10,000 scholarship per academic year. Bethel University is currently accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.http://www.sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=17040  Arts  Music, drama and performing arts are organized through a variety of entities within Bethel University. The academic branch of Bethel University houses the department of music, as well as the department of theatre.

They are prokaryotic and belong to the domain of archaea. They are common in wetlands, where they are responsible for marsh gas, and in the digestive tracts of animals such as ruminants and many humans, where they are responsible for the methane content of belching in ruminants and flatulence in humans. In marine sediments, the biological production of methane, also termed methanogenesis, is generally confined to where sulfates are depleted, below the top layers. Moreover, methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in anaerobic wastewater treatments. Others are extremophiles, found in environments such as hot springs and submarine hydrothermal vents as well as in the \\"solid\\" rock of Earth's crust, kilometers below the surface. Physical description Methanogens are coccoid (spherical shaped) or bacilli (rod shaped). There are over 50 described species of methanogens, which do not form a monophyletic group, although all known methanogens belong to Archaea. They are mostly anaerobic organisms that cannot function under aerobic conditions, but recently a species (Candidatus Methanothrix paradoxum) has been identified that can function in anoxic microsites within aerobic environments. They are very sensitive to the presence of oxygen even at trace level. Usually, they cannot sustain oxygen stress for a prolonged time. However, Methanosarcina barkeri is exceptional in possessing a superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme, and may survive longer than the others in the presence of O2. Some methanogens, called hydrogenotrophic, use carbon dioxide (CO2) as a source of carbon, and hydrogen as a reducing agent. The reduction of carbon dioxide into methane in the presence of hydrogen can be expressed as follows: :CO2 \\\\+ 4 H2 → CH4 \\\\+ 2H2O Some of the CO2 reacts with the hydrogen to produce methane, which creates an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane, used to generate ATP through chemiosmosis. In contrast, plants and algae use water as their reducing agent. Methanogens lack peptidoglycan, a polymer that is found in the cell walls of Bacteria but not in those of Archaea. Some methanogens have a cell wall that is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan. Other methanogens do not, but have at least one paracrystalline array (S-layer) made up of proteins that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Extreme living areas Methanogens play a vital ecological role in anaerobic environments of removing excess hydrogen and fermentation products that have been produced by other forms of anaerobic respiration. Methanogens typically thrive in environments in which all electron acceptors other than CO2 (such as oxygen, nitrate, ferric iron (Fe(III)), and sulfate) have been depleted. In deep basaltic rocks near the mid ocean ridges, they can obtain their hydrogen from the serpentinisation reaction of olivine as observed in the hydrothermal field of Lost City. The thermal breakdown of water and water radiolysis are other possible sources of hydrogen. Methanogens are key agents of remineralization of organic carbon in continental margin sediments and other aquatic sediments with high rates of sedimentation and high sediment organic matter. Under the correct conditions of pressure and temperature, biogenic methane can accumulate in massive deposits of methane clathrates, which account for a significant fraction of organic carbon in continental margin sediments and represent a key reservoir of a potent greenhouse gas. Methanogens have been found in several extreme environments on Earth – buried under kilometres of ice in Greenland and living in hot, dry desert soil. They are known to be the most common archaebacteria in deep subterranean habitats. Live microbes making methane were found in a glacial ice core sample retrieved from about three kilometres under Greenland by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley. They also found a constant metabolism able to repair macromolecular damage, at temperatures of 145 to –40 °C. Another studyIcarus (vol. 178, p. 277)cs:Methanogen has also discovered methanogens in a harsh environment on Earth. Researchers studied dozens of soil and vapour samples from five different desert environments in Utah, Idaho and California in the United States, and in Canada and Chile. Of these, five soil samples and three vapour samples from the vicinity of the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah were found to have signs of viable methanogens.Extreme bugs back idea of life on Mars Some scientists have proposed that the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere may be indicative of native methanogens on that planet. In June 2019, NASA’s Curiosity rover detected methane, commonly generated by underground microbes such as methanogens, which signals possibility of life on Mars. Closely related to the methanogens are the anaerobic methane oxidizers, which utilize methane as a substrate in conjunction with the reduction of sulfate and nitrate. Most methanogens are autotrophic producers, but those that oxidize CH3COO− are classed as chemotroph instead. Comparative genomics and molecular signatures Comparative proteomic analysis has led to the identification of 31 signature proteins which are specific for methanogens (also known as Methanoarchaeota). Most of these proteins are related to methanogenesis, and they could serve as potential molecular markers for methanogens. Additionally, 10 proteins found in all methanogens which are shared by Archaeoglobus, suggest that these two groups are related. In phylogenetic trees, methanogens are not monophyletic and they are generally split into three clades. Hence, the unique shared presence of large numbers of proteins by all methanogens could be due to lateral gene transfers. Additionally, more recent novel proteins associated with sulfide trafficking have been linked to methanogen archaea. More proteomic analysis is needed to further differentiate specific genera within the methanogen class and reveal novel pathways for methanogenic metabolism. Modern DNA or RNA sequencing approaches has elucidated several genomic markers specific to several groups of methanogens. One such finding isolated nine methanogens from genus Methanoculleus and found that there were at least 2 trehalose synthases genes that were found in all nine genomes. Thus far, the gene has been observed only in this genus, therefore it can be used as a marker to identify the archaea Methanoculleus. As sequencing techniques progress and databases become populated with an abundance of genomic data, a greater number of strains and traits can be identified, but many genera have remained understudied. For example, halophilic methanogens are potentially important microbes for carbon cycling in coastal wetland ecosystems but seem to be greatly understudied. One recent publication isolated a novel strain from genus Methanohalophilus which resides in sulfide-rich seawater. Interestingly, they have isolated several portions of this strain's genome that are different than other isolated strains of this genus (Methanohalophilus mahii, Methanohalophilus halophilus, Methanohalophilus portucalensis, Methanohalophilus euhalbius). Some differences include a highly conserved genome, sulfur and glycogen metabolisms and viral resistance. Genomic markers consistent with the microbes environment have been observed in many other cases. One such study found that methane producing archaea found in hydraulic fracturing zones had genomes which varied with vertical depth. Subsurface and surface genomes varied along with the constraints found in individual depth zones, though fine-scale diversity was also found in this study. It is important to recognize that genomic markers pointing at environmentally relevant factors are often non-exclusive. A survey of Methanogenic Thermoplasmata has found these organisms in human and animal intestinal tracts. This novel species was also found in other methanogenic environments such as wetland soils, though the group isolated in the wetlands did tend to have a larger number of genes encoding for anti-oxidation enzymes that were not present in the same group isolated in the human and animal intestinal tract. A common issue with identifying and discovering novel species of methanogens is that sometimes the genomic differences can be quite small, yet the research group decides they are different enough to separate into individual species. One study took a group of Methanocellales and ran a comparative genomic study. The three strains were originally considered identical, but a detailed approach to genomic isolation showed differences among their previously considered identical genomes. Differences were seen in gene copy number and there was also metabolic diversity associated with the genomic information. Genomic signatures not only allow one to mark unique methanogens and genes relevant to environmental conditions; it has also led to a better understanding of the evolution of these archaea. Some methanogens must actively mitigate against oxic environments. Functional genes involved with the production of antioxidants have been found in methanogens, and some specific groups tend to have an enrichment of this genomic feature. Methanogens containing a genome with enriched antioxidant properties may provide evidence that this genomic addition may have occurred during the Great Oxygenation Event. In another study, three strains from the lineage Thermoplasmatales isolated from animal gastro-intestinal tracts revealed evolutionary differences. The eukaryotic-like histone gene which is present in most methanogen genomes was not present, eluding to evidence that an ancestral branch was lost within Thermoplasmatales and related lineages. Furthermore, the group Methanomassiliicoccus has a genome which appears to have lost many common genes coding for the first several steps of methanogenesis. These genes appear to have been replaced by genes coding for a novel methylated methogenic pathway. This pathway has been reported in several types of environments, pointing to non-environment specific evolution, and may point to an ancestral deviation.  Metabolism   Methane production  Methanogens are known to produce methane from substrates such as H2/CO2, acetate, formate, methanol and methylamines in a process called methanogenesis. Different methanogenic reactions are catalyzed by unique sets of enzymes and coenzymes. While reaction mechanism and energetics vary between one reaction and another, all of these reactions contribute to net positive energy production by creating ion concentration gradients that are used to drive ATP synthesis. The overall reaction for H2/CO2 methanogenesis is: :CO2 + 4 H2 -> CH4 + 2 H2O (∆G˚’ = -134 kJ/mol CH4) Well-studied organisms that produce methane via H2/CO2 methanogenesis include Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Methanobacterium wolfei. These organisms are typically found in anaerobic environments. In the earliest stage of H2/CO2 methanogenesis, CO2 binds to methanofuran (MF) and is reduced to formyl-MF. This endergonic reductive process (∆G˚’= +16 kJ/mol) is dependent on the availability of H2 and is catalyzed by the enzyme formyl-MF dehydrogenase. :CO2 + H2 + MF -> HCO-MF + H2O The formyl constituent of formyl-MF is then transferred to the coenzyme tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) and is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme known as formyl transferase. This results in the formation of formyl-H4MPT. :HCO-MF + H4MPT -> HCO-H4MPT + MF Formyl-H4MPT is subsequently reduced to methenyl-H4MPT. Methenyl-H4MPT then undergoes a one- step hydrolysis followed by a two-step reduction to methyl-H4MPT. The two-step reversible reduction is assisted by coenzyme F420 whose hydride acceptor spontaneously oxidizes. Once oxidized, F420’s electron supply is replenished by accepting electrons from H2. This step is catalyzed by methylene H4MPT dehydrogenase. :HCO-H4MPT + H+ -> CH-H4MPT+ + H2O (Formyl-H4MPT reduction) :CH-H4MPT+ + F420H2 -> CH2=H4MPT + F420 + H+(Methenyl-H4MPT hydrolysis) :CH2=H4MPT + H2 -> CH3-H4MPT + H+(H4MPT reduction) Next, the methyl group of methyl-M4MPT is transferred to coenzyme M via a methyltransferase-catalyzed reaction. :CH3-H4MPT + HS-CoM -> CH3-S-CoM + H4MPT The final step of H2/CO2 methanogenic involves methyl-coenzyme M reductase and two coenzymes: N-7 mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate (HS-HTP) and coenzyme F430. HS-HTP donates electrons to methyl-coenzyme M allowing the formation of methane and mixed disulfide of HS-CoM. F430, on the other hand, serves as a prosthetic group to the reductase. H2 donates electrons to the mixed disulfide of HS-CoM and regenerates coenzyme M. :CH3-S-CoM + HS-HTP -> CH4 + CoM-S-S-HTP (Formation of methane) :CoM-S-S-HTP + H2 -> HS-CoM + HS-HTP (Regeneration of coenzyme M) Wastewater treatment Methanogens are widely used in anaerobic digestors to treat wastewater as well as aqueous organic pollutants. Industries have selected methanogens for their ability to perform biomethanation during wastewater decomposition thereby rendering the process sustainable and cost-effective.Appels, Lise; et.al. (2008). \\"Principles and potential of the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge\\" Progress in Energy and Combustion Science. 34 (6): 755 -781. doi: 10.1016/j.pecs.2008.06.002 Bio-decomposition in the anaerobic digester involves a four-staged cooperative action performed by different microorganisms.Christensen, Thomas H; et.al. (2010). \\"Anaerobic Digestion: Process\\" Solid Waste Technology & Management, Volume 1 & 2\\\\. doi: 10.1002/9780470666883.ch372 The first stage is the hydrolysis of insoluble polymerized organic matter by anaerobes such as Streptococcus and Enterobacterium.Shah, Fayyaz Ali, et. al. (2014). “Microbial Ecology of Anaerobic Digesters: The Key Players of Anaerobiosis” ScientificWorldJournal. 3852369 (1). doi:10.1155/2014/183752 In the second stage, acidogens break down dissolved organic pollutants in wastewater to fatty acids. In the third stage, acetogens convert fatty acids to acetates. In the final stage, methanogens metabolize acetates to gaseous methane. The byproduct methane leaves the aqueous layer and serves as an energy source to power wastewater-processing within the digestor, thus generating a self-sustaining mechanism. Methanogens also effectively decrease the concentration of organic matter in wastewater run-off. For instance, agricultural wastewater, highly rich in organic material, has been a major cause of aquatic ecosystem degradation. The chemical imbalances can lead to severe ramifications such as eutrophication. Through anaerobic digestion, the purification of wastewater can prevent unexpected blooms in water systems as well as trap methanogenesis within digesters. This allocates biomethane for energy production and prevents a potent greenhouse gas, methane, from being released into the atmosphere. The organic components of wastewater vary vastly. Chemical structures of the organic matter select for specific methanogens to perform anaerobic digestion. An example is the members of Methanosaeta genus dominate the digestion of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and brewery waste. Modernizing wastewater treatment systems to incorporate higher diversity of microorganisms to decrease organic content in treatment is under active research in the field of microbiological and chemical engineering.Marihiro, Takashi., Sekiguchi, Yuji. (2007). \\"Microbial communities in anaerobic digestion processes for waste and wastewater treatment: a microbiological update\\" Current Opinion in Biotechnology. 18 (3): 273-278. doi: 10.1016/j.copbio.2007.04.003 Current new generations of Staged Multi-Phase Anaerobic reactors and Upflow Sludge Bed reactor systems are designed to have innovated features to counter high loading wastewater input, extreme temperature conditions, and possible inhibitory compounds.

Smolin posits that the collapse of black holes could lead to the creation of a new universe.

It is characterized by an unusually small knee cap (patella) that develops out of and above the joint. Normally, as the knee cap sits in the joint, it is stimulated to growth by abrasion from the opposing bones. When not situated properly in the joint, the knee cap does not experience such stimulation and remains small and undeveloped. Note that the cartilage under and around the kneecap is eight times smoother than ice, so \\"abrasion\\" may not be the best term. A similar condition, patella alta, can occur as the result of a sports injury, though the large majority of the time it is a congenital/developmental condition that is unrelated to trauma. A kneecap in an \\"alta\\" position sits above the \\"trochlear groove\\" and therefore is less stable. The \\"patellar tendon\\" that connects the kneecap to the tibia (shinbone) is elongated (longer than normal). This cannot happen by way of trauma, unless there has been a rupture of the tendon and a less-than-optimal surgical repair. There has been only two documented case of the disorder noted from birth. In 1988, three-year-old Eric Rogstad of Minneapolis, Minnesota was discovered to suffer from the condition in both knees after several attempts by his parents and family physician to discover the cause of his abnormal difficulties with walking and running. After surgery and physical therapy, Eric gained the ability to walk and run without significant difficulty. In 2016 42 year old Anne Stone of Birmingham England was discovered to have the condition in both knees. Insall Ratio: This ratio is calculated with the knee flexed to 30 degrees. It is the ratio of the length of the patella to the length of the patellar tendon. Normally this ratio is 1:1 but 20% variation represents patella alta or patella infera. Actually, the Insall-Salvati ratio can be measured at any degree of flexion, which is one reason for its popularity.Grelsamer, RP: Patellar Malalignment - Current Concepts.

The fort was used by the British Army and the Canadian militia for its garrisons, and to defend the entrance of the Toronto Harbour. The fort features stone-lined earthwork walls and eight historical buildings within them, including two blockhouses. The fort forms a part of Fort York National Historic Site, a that includes the fort, Garrison Common, military cemeteries, and a visitor centre. The fort originated from a garrison established by John Graves Simcoe in 1793. Anglo-American tensions resulted in the fort to being further fortified and made an official British Army post in 1798. The original fort was destroyed by American forces following the Battle of York in April 1813. Work to rebuild the fort began later in 1813 over the remains of the old fort, and was completed in 1815. The rebuilt fort served as a military hospital for the remainder of the War of 1812, although it briefly saw action against an American naval vessel in August 1814. After the war, the fort continued to see use by the British Army and the Canadian militia; even after newer fortifications were erected west of Fort York in the 1840s. In 1870, the property was formally transferred to the Canadian militia. The municipal government assumed ownership of the fort in 1909, although the Canadian military continued to make use of the fort until the end of the Second World War. The fort and the surrounding area was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923. The fort was restored to its early-19th century configuration in 1934, and reopened as a museum on the War of 1812 and military life in 19th century Canada. Name The name Fort York is a retronym, with the fortifications initially called the Garrison, the Garrison at York, or the Fort at York, the latter two taking its name from the settlement the fort protected. After new fortifications were built in 1841, residents of Toronto referred to the older fortifications as the Old Fort, in order to distinguish it from the new fort. Usage of the term Fort York to refer to the old fort emerged during the 1870s. The site was referred to as Old Fort York from the time it was converted to historic museum in the early 20th century to 1970, when the Toronto Historical Society re- branded the site as Historic Fort York. History The British first examined Toronto as a potential settlement and military site during the 1780s, although a permanent military presence was not established in Toronto until 1793; during a period when Anglo-American relations had deteriorated. In the early 1790s, John Graves Simcoe, the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, began to consider building a fort in Toronto; as a part of a larger effort to reposition isolated British garrisons in the U.S. Northwest Territory and near the Canada-U.S. border to more centralized positions, and to vacate British forces from U.S. territory in an attempt to reduce tensions with the Americans. Simcoe's decision to base a fort in Toronto was also influenced by his assessment that American forces could overrun its positions in the frontier, including its naval base in Kingston. John Graves Simcoe, the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. He first considered establishing a garrison in Toronto during the 1790s. Simcoe selected Toronto (renamed York from 1793 to 1834) as the location of a new military garrison, due to its proximity away from the border, and because its natural harbour only had one access point from water, making it easy to defend. Once established, Simcoe envisioned the harbour as a base where British control over Lake Ontario could be exerted, and where they could repel a potential American attack from the west into eastern Upper Canada. He also envisioned the fort serving as the centre of a transportation network where British forces could be dispatched throughout the colony. Simcoe planned for the fort to be connected to a network of subsidiary fortifications along a series of east–west roads acting as an alternate transportation route to the Great Lakes, and the north–south portage route that leads to the Georgian Bay. The latter route was vital for maintaining communication with British outposts in lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, in the event the routes through Lake Erie and the Detroit River become cut off by Americans forces. However, many of the planned subsidiary forts were never built, with Simcoe unable to procure the funds needed to build them. Original fort (1793–1813) The first permanent British garrison was established in Toronto on 20 July 1793, when 100 soldiers from the Queen's Rangers landed around Garrison Creek; and erected 30 cabins built from green wood on the site of the fort for wintering quarters; configured in a triangular shape similar to the present fort's shape. Simcoe planned for Fort York to be a part of a defence complex built around the settlement's harbour, with the fort situated north of another fortification planned at Gibraltar Point. However, his proposals to further fortify the settlement was rejected by the governor general of the Canadas, Lord Dorchester, who took the position that the money should instead be spent on improving the defences at the naval base in Kingston. Simcoe pressed forward with the construction of Fort York in spite of the governor general's objections; although he had to rely on funds from the provincial treasury as opposed to military funds, given that the fort was not an official army post. By November 1793, Fort York consisted of two log barracks, a stockade, and a sawmill to provide lumber. Over the next year, the Queen's Rangers erected a guard house, and two blockhouses near Gibraltar Point, albeit at a smaller scale than what was envisioned by Simcoe. The fort defended the harbour's access point, as well as the most likely landward approach the Americans would take towards the settlement; with British planners believing American forces would land west of the harbour, and advance towards the settlement with the support of its naval vessels. Simcoe continued to develop York's fortifications until the end of 1794, when he concluded that York could not be defended in its current state. In 1794, Simcoe took several artillery pieces from these fortifications after he was ordered to erect Fort Miamis in the Northwest Territory, leaving York with only a few condemned guns that were taken from Kingston. By the time most of the colony's administration was relocated to York in 1796, the fort was manned by a 147-man garrison. As York's naval shipyards were based at Humber Bay, and no naval base existed in its harbour, the defensive capabilities of Fort York remained limited. However, two other blockhouses were erected around the settlement, including one at Fort York. The blockhouse at Fort York also featured a cupola, used to guide ships into the harbour. Fort York in 1804. Most of the fort's original structures were renovated or rebuilt at the end of the 18th century. In late 1798, Fort York formally became an official British Army post, granting it access to funds reserved for military use. After the fort was made an official military post, a stockade was built around the fort. Many of its original structures were also replaced with new buildings, including a barracks, carriage and engine shed, the colonial government house, guardhouse, gunpowder magazine, and storehouses. As Anglo-American tensions rose again in the beginning of the 19th century, Major-General Isaac Brock ordered the construction of three artillery batteries, and a wall and dry moat on the western boundary of the fort. The batteries were equipped with furnaces, allowing the batteries to fire heated shot, with further 12-pounder guns placed on mobile carriages used to respond to threats outside the fixed ranges of the batteries. Simcoe's original proposal of using York as a naval base was also reconsidered during the early 19th century, with plans to expand the fort near Government House to accommodate a naval base. However, as the majority of the naval assets in Upper Canada were based in Kingston, the governor general of the Canadas, George Prévost, planned to make the move to York in phases. Map of York prior to the Battle of York in 1813. The fort is visible north of the harbour's entrance. When news of the American declaration of war arrived at York, the regulars and military cavalry squad of the fort left for the Niagara peninsula, eventually participating in the Battle of Queenston Heights. While its garrison was deployed in the Niagara, Fort York was manned by the Canadian militia. However, it was apparent to the colonial administration that the settlement could not repel an attack without further improvements to its fortifications; something not possible due to wartime shortages. Battle of York The town of York was eventually attacked by American forces in April 1813. The attack formed the first part of Henry Dearborn's plan to take the Canadas by first attacking York, than the Niagara peninsula, Kingston, and finally Montreal. Fort York formed a part of the settlement's defences, which included batteries and blockhouses around the town and Gibraltar Point. After reports of approaching American ships reached the settlement, most professional troops in the area, First Nations-allied warriors, and some members of the local militia assembled at fort. The regulars and militias stationed at the town's blockhouse were later ordered to reassemble at Fort York once it was made apparent that no landings would occur east of the settlement. Most of the fighting occurred during the American landing, approximately west of the fort. Unable to prevent the landings, and repel the force at the western battery, the British-First Nations force eventually retreated back to the fort. American forces advanced east towards the fort, and assembled themselves outside its walls, exchanging artillery fire with the fort. The naval squadron also bombarded the fort, having re- positioned themselves directly south of the fort's stockade. Recognizing that the battle was lost, the British commanding officer, Roger Hale Sheaffe, ordered for a silent withdrawal from the fort, and to rig the fort's gunpowder magazine to explode in order to prevent its capture. The two sides continued to exchange artillery fire until Sheaffe's withdrawal from the fort was complete. Because the British flag was left on the flagpole of the fort, the Americans assembling outside its walls assumed the fort remained occupied. The American naval squadron exchanges fire with the fort during the Battle of York As the gunpowder magazine contained 74 tons of iron shells and 300 barrels of gunpowder, a significant amount of debris was launched into the air once the gunpowder magazine was ignited; dropping onto the American forces still outside the fort. The following explosion resulted in over 250 American casualties. Fearing a counterattack after the explosion, American forces regrouped outside the wall, and did not advance onto the abandoned fort until after British forces left York. The fort was occupied by the American forces after the town's surrender. During the brief occupation, members of the militia were detained in the fort for two days before being released on \\"parole\\". The British dead were buried within the fort in shallow graves, although they were later reburied outside the fort after the Americans departed the town. Government House, already damaged by the gunpowder magazine explosion, was razed by American forces on 1 May 1813. Prior to their departure from York, the American forces razed several more buildings including most of the structures in the fort, except its barracks. Rebuilt fort (1813–present) Plans to rebuild the settlement's defences, including the fort, and the surrounding blockhouses were undertaken in the second half of 1813; in an effort to defend a four-vessel squadron the Royal Navy planned to station at York's harbour. Several structures were completed at the fort by November 1813, including the Government House Battery and the Circular Battery, each equipped with two mortars; with another two blockhouses nearing completion. The blockhouses were also designed to act as barracks for the town's garrison, in order to allow for the immediate garrisoning of troops in the settlement. In the following years, the forest around the fort was cleared to deprive Americans of cover in the event of another attack; and the defensive earthworks, barracks, and gunpowder magazine were rebuilt. The fort was not completed until around 1815; due to small numbers of artificer available at York, and a warm 1813–14 winter preventing the use of sleighs to transport supplies during that season. The fort operated as a hospital centre from the latter half of 1813 to the end of the war, with the naval squadron stationed at York assisting in transporting wounded soldiers from the Niagara front to the town. On 6 August 1814, an American naval squadron arrived near York's harbour, under the suspicion that British vessels were stationed there. The squadron dispatched the to sail into the harbour under a white flag in a ploy to evaluate the town's defences. However, the militia stationed in the fort shot at the vessel, resulting in the two sides exchanging fire before the Lady of the Lake withdrew back to its squadron outside the harbour. The American squadron did not attempt another attack on the fort, although remained outside York's harbour for three days before sailing away. Post War of 1812 Diagram of Fort York, c. 1823 Work on the fort came to an immediate halt at the end of the war. By 1816, the rebuilt fort included eighteen buildings capable of holding a garrison of 650 soldiers. An additional 350 soldiers were also capable of being garrisoned in military facilities adjacent to the fort. After the war, the fort continued to be a point of focus for military planners in the region, with York envisioned as an area that could provide cover for a retreat to Kingston and Lower Canada, or as a rallying point for British forces to defend the Niagara peninsula. The British also continued to use the fort to protect the north–south portage route to the upper Great Lakes. In the decades after the War of 1812, several buildings were torn down and replaced. However, the condition of the fort was largely shaped by British foreign relations; with the fort suffering from poor maintenance during times of peace, and undergoing repairs and reinforcing during perceived signs of hostilities. By the early 1830s, it had become apparent that new fortifications needed to be built to replace the decaying Fort York, with a plan formally approved in 1833. Completed in 1841, New Fort York was situated west of Fort York, and was initially only connected to a settlement via a pathway through Fort York. Plans were in place to also build three martello towers between Fort York and Gibraltar Point, although those plans were abandoned. Although new fortifications were erected, the military continued to use Fort York's batteries to help defend the harbour; and the adjacent open space for drills, and as a rifle range. In addition to housing military facilities, from 1839 to 1840, the fort briefly hosted a Royal Society's meteorological and magnetic observatory, before they moved to their permanent location at the University of King's College. At the onset of the Rebellions of 1837–1838, the garrison at Fort York was dispatched to Lower Canada, resulting in the fort only being manned by 10 regulars of the British Army. The fort was eventually reinforced by the Queen's Rangers after the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern, with members of the militia descending on the city to defend the colonial government. The fort was left virtually unmanned again in 1854, after the garrison was recalled to participate in the Crimean War. During their two-year absence, the fort was largely maintained by a staff of 150 \\"enroled pensioners,\\" made up of British Army retirees who were granted land around the city following their retirement. Depiction of Fort York in 1860 Deteriorating Anglo-American relations in the 1860s as a result of the Trent Affair prompted the military to look into fortifying the Toronto garrison, using it as a base to repulse, or slow down, a potential invasion of Canada West. The proposal had the shore batteries of the fort dismantled, and replaced with rifled artillery on mobile carriages. The proposal failed to materialize, although continued to be suggested into the 1880s. In an effort to reduce tensions with the Americans in the lead up to the signing of the Treaty of Washington, the British began to withdraw its military forces from all its secondary North American garrisons, including Fort York. Fort York was formally handed over to the federal government of Canada on 25 July 1870. The last British imperial troops stationed at Fort York departed in 1871, alongside two Canadian militia regiments as a part of the Wolseley expedition. During the 1870s and 1880s, the provincial and municipal governments inquired about purchasing Fort York, although the offers were rejected by the Department of Militia and Defence; as the old fort served as New Fort York's only access point to the rest of the city, as well as its rifle range. The fort was also be used as familial quarters for regulars, militia offices, storage space, and as a training ground. During the Second Boer War, and the First World War, the fort was also used as a local enlistment centre. In 1903, an agreement was reached between for the municipal government of Toronto to purchase the old fort, as well as New Fort York. As a part of the deed of transfer from the Department of Militia and Defence, the city agreed to preserve, and \\"properly care for\\" the old fort. The agreement also allowed the military to continue to use as much as of the property as they needed, until newer facilities were built for them. The Canadian militia continued to occupy the fort as a storehouse for ammunition and supplies, and as dwellings for military families until the 1930s, when restorations of the fort were underway. streetcar route through Fort York in 1905. The proposal led to the formation of an association who successfully appealed for the fort's preservation. In 1905, a proposal to build a streetcar through Fort York prompted historical, and military organizations to form the \\"Old Fort Protective Association\\". Although the streetcar proposal never came to fruition, appeals from the association, political figures, and the Toronto media, led Canadian prime minister Wilfrid Laurier to place new conditions of the fort's deed of transfer, requiring the city to restore the old fort to its original condition, or have the adjacent commons revert to federal ownership. The property was formally transferred from the Department of Militia and Defence to the municipal government in 1909. On 25 May 1923, Fort York was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada. Conversion into a museum Artifacts on display in an exhibit inside the fort's blockhouse. The fort was converted into a museum in 1934. In 1932, the municipal government of Toronto undertook a two-year restoration of Fort York, converting the fort into a historic site and museum. The city began to restore the fort to its 1816 configuration as a make-work program, and to celebrate the centennial of the incorporation of Toronto. As a result of the restoration, the Canadian militia ended its occupancy of the fort, although the military briefly reused parts of Fort York during the Second World War. In order to accommodate the military, Fort York Armoury was built in between Fort York and New Fort York in the 1930s. Fort York was formally reopened as a museum on Victoria Day in 1934. In 1949, management of the fort was transferred from Toronto Parks Division, to the Toronto Civic Historical Committee (predecessor of the Toronto Historical Board); with further restoration work on the site also carried out that year. In 1958, the government of Metropolitan Toronto proposed to move Fort York along Toronto's contemporary waterfront, whose location was now further south from the fort as a result of land reclamation projects during the late 1800s and early 1900s. The regional government proposed the move in an effort to make way for the Gardiner Expressway, and to \\"recreate\\" the fort's original setting by the shoreline. However, the proposal was eventually rejected due to public opposition, with the planned expressway rerouted around the fort. The public effort to save the fort served as the impetus for the historic preservation movement in Toronto, as well as the foundations for the Toronto Historical Board. Several excavations were conducted between 1976 and 2011 to determine the exact location of several demolished buildings, and the initial topography of the fort. The fort was included in the City of Toronto's inaugural inventory of heritage properties in 1973; with the entire precinct later designated as a \\"heritage conservation district\\" in 1985. In 1994, the Friends of Fort York and Garrison Common was formed from local residents, with the organization later incorporating as a registered charity to support the national historic site. Following the amalgamation of Toronto in 1997, museum operations fell under the city's Museum and Heritage Services. However, in 2000, Toronto City Council transferred management of the fort to a board of citizen appointees, separate from the other municipally-operated museums in Toronto. In September 2017, Fort York served as the archery venue for the 2017 Invictus Games, a multi-parasports event for wounded, injured or sick armed forces personnel. Grounds Although the fort was built along the city's original shoreline, it is presently inland as a result of land reclamation projects from the 1850s to 1920s. Fort York National Historic Site occupies approximate of land. When the fort was initially established, it was situated along the Toronto waterfront. However, decades of land reclamation projects beginning in 1850 resulted in the fort being situated inland by the 1920s. At one point, the military reserve that the fort was on was , although its size slowly shrank as portions of the reserve were partitioned to build housing and factories. The grounds is the property of the municipal government of Toronto, and is one of several National Historic Sites of Canada not owned or maintained by Parks Canada. The national historic site includes Fort York, the mustering grounds west of the fort known as Garrison Common, the visitor centre, and military cemeteries situated to the north of the fort; including cemeteries and green spaces physically separated from the rest of the national historic site by the Railway Lands. The parkland north of the Railway Lands is connected to the rest of the historic site by two pedestrian and cycle bridges completed in 2019. The two bridges are the first bridges in Canada to be made entirely of stainless steel. The cemetery was used for the internment of soldiers and their families from 1793 to 1863. A portion of the cemetery was later renamed Victoria Memorial Square. Several of the original headstones used in the cemetery were later utilized to create a memorial at Victoria Memorial Square. In 2004, the provincial heritage conversation district was expanded to include Fort York Armoury, located southwest of the visitor centre. However, as opposed to the rest of the historic site, Fort York Armoury remains in use as a drill hall and armoury for the Canadian Army, with the Department of National Defence acting as the custodians for the building. The Fort York Guard march past the fort's stone-walled gunpowder magazine. The guards are historical reenactors employed at the site. The grounds of the national historic site, including Garrison Common, the military cemeteries, and the parkland is accessible to the public year-round. However, access to the fort and the visitor centre, is limited by the museum's operating hours. Exhibits on the War of 1812, and military life in 19th century Canada are displayed in the buildings inside the fort, and the visitor centre. In addition to museum exhibits, the site also employs historical reenactors made up of secondary school students, known as the Fort York Guard. The reenactment unit was constituted in 1994 by the Toronto Historical Board; with its management later assumed by the Friends of Fort York association. The Fort York Guard and its band component wear the uniforms of the Canadian Regiment of Fencible Infantry. Fort The fort complex occupies approximately of land, and includes the bastioned, stone-lined earthwork, and buildings within it. The fort is the only remaining authentic fort that was built in Canada during the War of 1812, with its defensive earthworks, and seven buildings dating to its 1813–15 reconstruction. The buildings in the fort form the largest collection of buildings dating from the War of 1812 in Canada. The fort itself contains eight historical buildings, seven of which date back to the fort's reconstruction from 1813 to 1815, while the eighth building is a reconstruction of a barracks that previously stood at the fort. Buildings that date back to the fort's 1813–15 reconstruction includes the two blockhouses, two soldiers barracks, officers' \\"brick barracks\\" and mess hell, a brick- walled magazine, a stone-walled magazine. The following buildings are all situated in their original arrangements, and uses its original materials, design, and finishes. The stone magazine is a store for ammunition and gunpowder, whose walls are thick, and features a vaulted bomb-proof door. Problems in the magazine's foundations shortly after its completion led to the construction of the brick magazine. In addition to its historical buildings, the fort also contains several small modern facilities used for museum operations. These include a modern kitchen and washrooms built into the northern ramparts of the fort, and a small gunpowder magazine dating to the 1970s. Barracks Interior of the enlisted barracks There are three barracks that date back to the fort's 1813–15 reconstruction, two enlisted barracks, and one officers' barracks and mess hall. The living space provided in the officers' barracks contrasted greatly living spaces provided for enlisted soldiers. The two enlisted barracks at the fort housed a larger number of soldiers, as well as their families, although by the 1860s, these barracks were largely used as married quarters, for three soldiers and their families. Restored to its 1830s configuration, the brick officers' barrack holds two apartments for officers; with each apartment holding four living quarters for officers, and a kitchen/servant's room. The mess hall portion of the brick barracks was designed as a general officers' mess hall and has two access points, one to the outside, and another to the barracks portion of the building. Servants rooms were also provided a separate entry point from the rest of the barracks. The officers' brick barracks also contains the city's \\"oldest kitchen,\\" with a steep staircase in the kitchen pantry leading to the basement kitchen. The oven remains in the kitchen, although its floors have been removed for archeological studies. A ground level kitchen was added to the building in 1826. The fourth barracks inside the fort, the blue officer' barracks and mess hall is a reconstruction of a junior officers barracks that stood on the site. The single-storey reconstruction is made up of four apartments, each containing four separate quarters connected by a central hall for three officers and a servant's room/kitchen. The blue barracks reconstruction was built in 1986. Blockhouses As with a number of other British-designed fortifications for the time, the fort's two blockhouses featured splinter-proof constructions, loopholes and portholes for small arms and small artillery pieces, and a second storey that overhangs off the first. However, contrasting other blockhouses built by the British during this period, the blockhouses at Fort York included a cellar storage, and magazine facilities; although lacked windows on the first floor, deemed too dangerous to place in the blockhouses. The levels of the blockhouses were designed so that they may isolate themselves from the other floor of the blockhouse, in the event the other level is penetrated. The foundations of the blockhouses are made of limestone and shale, coursed and laid in lime mortar; whereas the square-timber walls were made of white pine reinforced with trunnels. Clapboards were placed on the exterior wall in order to improve its impermeability. Both blockhouses featured raised entrances on the second floor facing the east, with the expectation that an attack on the fort would come from the west. The fort's two blockhouses were positioned north of the fort's shore batteries, defending the rear approaches of the batteries, while the rest of the fort's defences were being built. After the fort was completed, the blockhouses reverted to a secondary role, serving as the fort's citadel. The blockhouses were also designed to act as barracks, with the blockhouse situated in the southeast (Blockhouse No. 1) able to accommodate 120 soldiers, whereas the blockhouse situated near the circular battery (Blockhouse No. 2) is capable of housing 160 soldiers. For a brief period, shortly after the 1837–38 rebellions, both blockhouses were equipped with a dry moat and draw bridge, although these entrenchments were later filled in. The interior of the blockhouses were modified on several occasions in order to match the contemporary needs of the military, and later the museum. Ramparts The buildings are surrounded by bastioned, stone-lined earthwork designed to absorb incoming cannon fire; with room for palisades to be placed on the earthen walls to prevent land assaults. Although land reclamation projects in the 18th and 19th centuries made the fort no longer situated along the Toronto waterfront, the original shoreline embankment is still visible outside the southern ramparts of the fort. The location of the ramparts have also been modified throughout the decades, with the ramparts having been refortified/rebuilt in 1838, the 1860s, and the 1930s. In 1916, the northeastern portion of the ramparts were demolished to make way for the Bathurst streetcar route. The northeastern portion of the ramparts were rebuilt in the 1930s, when the municipal government was restoring the rest of the fort. However, due to the growth of the Railway Lands in the previous decade, the northern portion of the ramparts were rebuilt further south from its original location; with the wall's reconstruction also necessitating the demolition of a barracks. During the same period, the fort's southern ramparts were also raised from its earlier configuration, and moved approximately north. The fort and its ramparts has nine gun placements, although was designed with the intention of placing more guns in other strategic areas inside the fort during wartime. The central \\"circular battery\\" on the fort's southern ramparts was expanded in 1828 in order to accommodate more guns. Palisades were erected along the earthen wall during the 1860s, in addition to the construction of parapets, and an additional seven-gun battery along the southern ramparts. Demolished structures Government House within the fort. Built , the building was destroyed in 1813. Its remains are buried under the present fort. A number of other buildings were also erected within the fort that were later demolished. There remains little trace of the fort's original topography, or its original structures, most of which is buried underground. The remains of the original fort built in 1793 is situated under the present fort, with the remains of the first Government House buried under the fort's parade grounds. Debris and ruins from the battle in April 1813 was also later buried and deposited in the crater created by the detonation of the gunpowder magazine. The location of the gunpowder magazine that was ignited during the battle is marked by a maple tree; and contains a plaque commemorating the Rush-Bagot Treaty, a treaty signed shortly after the War of 1812 that led to the demilitarization of the Great Lakes. A number of buildings were erected during the fort's 1813–15 reconstruction, with the fort holding 18 buildings in 1816. However, a number of these buildings were later demolished, including the carpenter's shop, the sappers' and miners' barracks, the soldiers barracks, and a cook house along the southern ramparts. Work on a third blockhouse along the fort's western wall was also underway in 1815, but was destroyed by a fire and was not rebuilt. The carpenter building appeared to have been demolished after 1815, the barracks were demolished in 1822, and the cook house was torn down in 1848. The Commandant's House, \\"D\\" Barrack, the artillery barracks and the 1838 cookhouse were also structures within Fort York that were later demolished. However, the area where these cluster of buildings were situated is located north of the present fort; as the fort's northern ramparts were rebuilt further south from its original location during the 1930s restoration. Visitor centre The visitor centre is a rectangular building that lies north of the Gardiner Expressway, and south of Garrison Common. The contract to design the building was awarded to Patkau Architects, in collaboration with Kearns Mancini Architects in December 2009. The building was opened to the public in 2014, although was not completed until 2015. The building is built along the original escarpment of Lake Ontario's shoreline, with the building also acting as a retaining wall for the escarpment and Garrison Common directly north of the centre. The roof of the building features a green roof; which also contains the exit to the centre, depositing its visitors to the Garrison Common. The exterior southern facade of the building is made of monolithic weathering steel panels, reflecting where the historical escarpment and shoreline of the lake would be in the early 19th century. Light permeates into the building through glazed slits between the steel panels for parts of the facade that are covered by the steel panels. Certain parts of the southern facade features a glass wall, with the steel panels placed in an \\"awning-like\\" position allowing visitors outside to glimpse into the museum. All the steel panels are bolted into place, although may be dismantled when room needs to be made for highway maintenance crews. The interior of the building is designed to circulate visitors through a ramp, from the centre's entrance at the base of the structure, towards an ascending access ramp that leads towards Garrison Common. The visitor centre holds several exhibits including a exhibit of artifacts from the War of 1812, a vault to display light-sensitive artifacts, and a \\"immersive exhibit\\" of the Battle of York. In addition to exhibition galleries, the visitor centre also holds administrative offices, and a community meeting centre. Surrounding defences The Sherbourne Blockhouse off Bloor and Sherbourne Street, 1862. Fort York, and several blockhouses in the city's periphery defended the approaches into Toronto. In addition to Fort York, the British erected a number of other fortifications and artillery batteries to defend the community. However, with the exception of Fort York, and New Fort York's officers' quarters, all of these structures were demolished by the mid-20th century. Prior to the Battle of York in 1813, the settlement was defended by Fort York and three other blockhouses, two blockhouses at Gibraltar Point, and one in the town around King and Parliament Street. In addition to these blockhouses, the town was also defended by two artillery batteries west of the fort, the Western Battery, and the Half-Moon Battery. Most of the original fort, in addition to the three blockhouses around the settlement were destroyed by American forces following the Battle of York. After the Battle of York, the fort was rebuilt, and three blockhouses were erected around the settlement; one at Gibraltar Point, another built next to the Western Battery, while the third blockhouse was built around Queen Street, defending the inland western approach into the town. The blockhouse on Queen Street was dismantled in 1818, whereas the other two were left \\"in ruins\\" by the mid-1820s. Following the rebellions in 1837–38, three more blockhouses were erected in the periphery of Toronto; one around College Street and Spadina Avenue, another blockhouse on Sherbourne Street, and a third along Yonge Street. In 1841, New Fort York was completed along the shoreline west of Fort York. The three blockhouses were dismantled and removed by the mid-19th century. Conversely, New Fort York remained in use by the military until the end of the Second World War. The majority of the New Fort York was demolished in 1951, although the new fort's officers' quarters still stands.

Externally, the VZ200 resembles a cross between the Commodore Vic 20 (whose name it closely resembles) and the Sinclair Spectrum. The VZ200 features the one touch command keys of the Spectrum, but unlike the Sinclair machines, their use was not mandatory. Internally, the VZ200 is a workalike of the Tandy TRS-80 Model I. The micro uses the same basic architecture, but TRS-80 programs cannot be loaded and only simple TRS-80 BASIC programs can be entered as it has a different memory map and some commands in BASIC are absent and can only be substituted by significant alterations in program algorithms, so it cannot be considered a true clone. The connections consist of a port for an unregulated DC power supply (the voltage regulator is on the PCB), a stereophonic earphone jack for a cassette recorder, an RF modulated video output, an edge connector which is a printer and disk drive port, an edge connector that is a joystick port, and a composite monitor output (NTSC 60 Hz output in north America, PAL 50 Hz output in the British Commonwealth and continental Europe). The VZ200 uses a copy of a Zilog Z80 processor (made under licence by NEC) running at 3.58 Mhz (3.54 Mhz on VZ300) and was initially sold with either 4 Kb (Europe) or 6 Kb (in USA), which was increased to 8 KB within weeks of its release. A 16kB expansion unit was available, increasing RAM to 24kB. The VZ300 was initially sold with 18kB of RAM. An 8 kB system consists of 6 kB of RAM, 16 kB of ROM, and 2 kB of video RAM. The memory could be expanded to 24 kB (22 kB memory plus 2 kB video memory). Like the TRS-80, both memory and i/o locations are mapped. The optional 16 kB RAM expansion VZ200 with additional RAM plugged in Extended RAM was available above top RAM using the remote offset addressing method available on the Z80 (also known as bank switching). Banks of system memory can be reassigned using an offset above the top RAM. Those banks are then no longer available, so program algorithms cannot be used in extended memory (as the program would \\"disappear\\" when extended memory is accessed), so it can only be used for program data. Video RAM can be increased to access the higher modes of the 6847 since there are video RAM chip select lines on the memory expansion. Remote offset addressing must be used because the video processor cannot address system or internal expansion RAM, externally connected RAM must be used. BASIC Like most early micros, the VZ including a built-in BASIC interpreter in ROM, which is used not just for programming, but for accessing the OS, recording programs, and all other operations on the micro. The VZ200 uses a version of Microsoft Basic II, similar but not identical to Level II Basic on the TRS-80, including useful commands like SET, PRINT@ and IF-THEN-ELSE. Firmware machine code routines are available using the RSX command. The firmware contains a large number of useful routines provided by Zilog, via NEC. Some TRS-80 BASIC commands, such as RANDOMIZE, ON and the really useful DEF commands (only subroutines can be used for formulae), are not available, so only simple TRS-80 programs can be entered without alteration. The Basic can use integers, decimals and floating point numbers. Double precision numbers are not available, but can be used by storing the different power position numbers in a string and concatenating the strings. Video A VZ200 in operation The VZ200 uses the Motorola 6847 video processor, which has a resolution of 256 × 192 pixels made from either 8 × 8 pixel character blocks in a 32 × 24 block screen, or a monochrome bitmapped mode. As the VZ200 is limited to only 2 kB of video memory since only 4 kB of memory in total was initially available, the screen is limited to only 16 lines down, making the total number of pixels in text mode 256 × 128 pixels. The bitmapped mode is unavailable. The VZ200 has nine colours, an eight colour palette plus black. The VZ200 has 256 predefined character blocks. Text is only available in upper case. The character blocks cannot be redefined. The screen can use green mode or black mode, the latter using inverse colours. MODE 0 In mode 0, the background colour can be either dark green or orange. In mode 0, text uses a black foreground with either background colour. The first 128 character blocks are 64 alpha-numeric characters and their inverses. Text mode 0 is the only mode in which black is available. The latter 128 character blocks consist of a 2×2 pixel block in each possible combination (8), in every of the 8 colour palette for foreground, together with either background colour chosen. Black is not available. MODE 1 For mode 1, two colour sets are used with each background colour : :SET 1 -> background : light green - foreground : light green, yellow, blue or red. :SET 2 -> background : buff [white] - foreground : buff, cyan, magenta or orange. Text is identical to Mode 0, using either colour set for foreground with each background colour. The difference is that all 2kB of video memory is used, whereas only 512 bytes of video memory is used for Mode 0, and the text cannot be black, which is unavailable in this mode. The graphics mode has 128×64 addressable points. For each character block, the background colour can be either light green or buff (white), with the foreground any of the four colours in the set. The colours can be used in any combination on the screen, but only one colour set can be used per screen, so screens are limited to five colours at most. Black is not available in this mode. However by using intricate video timing in assembly it is possible to display all eight colours on the screen, as shown in the VZ200 Five Finger Punch demo '2018AD' and Bushy555's demo '8 colours'. Both of these demos technically should not be possible. Sound output An internal latch is used for cassette output, to drive the piezoelectric loudspeaker attached to the casing, and to control two signals for the 6847 video processor. The loudspeaker is driven using a push- pull method, alternating the outputs on bits 0 and 5 of the latch. A 2.5 octave range is available. Models Laser 310 / VZ-300 VTech Laser 310 with keyboard template and cassette deck The Laser 310 was released in 1985 throughout parts of Europe, Mainland China and the United States. It was named and sold as the \\"Dick Smith\\" VZ 300 throughout Australia and New Zealand. Also based on a Zilog Z80A CPU with a slightly updated 16k ROM version, it was driven by a television colour burst (3.54 MHz) crystal. It came with 16k of RAM for programming, along with the same 2k of Video Ram as that of the Laser 200. The VZ300 had a small number of physical upgrades, but is completely compatible with the VZ200. Externally, the rubber keys were replaced with hard plastic capped keys. The case was made with a less brittle type of plastic. Video Technology used higher capacity memory ICs for the VZ-300, having 18kb of memory (16kb CPU RAM + 2kb video RAM). The system RAM capacity was increased to 16kB, which together with 16kB of expansion RAM, makes a total of 34kB RAM for the system. The VZ200 16kb RAM expansion could be used, but because of the way the chip select pins were arranged, only 8kB would actually be available. ETI magazine in Australia published an electronic circuit which would enable VZ300 owners to use all 16kB of the VZ200 expansion. Rare 64k VZ300 unit - There is at least one VZ300 known to exist with 66k of memory (64K RAM + 2K Video), built on the motherboard, built by Video Technology. This unit uses 8x HM4864P-2 8K Static Ram chips instead of the usual 8x 2K memory chips.  Laser 100 / Laser 110  The Video Technology Laser 110 computer. The Laser 100 and 110 were released just prior to the Laser 210 / VZ200. These computers were a near identical clone to that of the TRS-80 Model 1. Both computers were released with the same orange coloured keyboard 'chicklet' style keyboard on a black background. Both computers also had the same BASIC in ROM, of which, there are at least three versions: 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. The laser 100 was released with 2K RAM + 2K Video RAM, whilst the laser 110 was released with 4K RAM + 2K Video RAM. Both computers supported colour within the internal language interpreters (BASIC, Assembler), however, the output video from the NTSC and PAL circuitry only supplied black and white signals. The Laser 100 and 110 computers were never released as a re-badged 'VZ-100'.  Laser 305  A rare Laser 305 computer The Laser 305 is an extremely rare computer produced by Video Technology. Essentially it is the Laser 310 motherboard placed inside the Laser 200 keyboard, of which, anyone with these two computers could perform themselves. However, the original release and the reasoning behind VTech releasing this particular configuration, unfortunately, has been lost to history. At the time of writing, there are only two known Laser 305's in existence.  Seltron 200  The Seltron 200 Color Computer is quite unique. It was only sold throughout the two countries of Hungary and Italy and is unique with its own configuration layout of the motherboard; quite different to that of the other family of computers. The Seltron's motherboard contained the same custom VZ300/Laser310 single packaged GA003 and GA004 chipsets (which replaced discrete VZ200/Laser200-210 components), though the design eliminated the need for the GA008 (clock register and DRAM controller) that is used in the 16Kb VZ300/Laser310. Some speculate that it was Video Technology's attempt at cost reducing the manufacturing process. It was released with the usual 2Kb of video RAM, along with 2Kb of user RAM (Same as the Laser 200), however, the motherboard allowed for further expansion of another 2 KB or 4Kb of RAM. By adding an additional 2x 2 KB user RAM it would bring the Seltron up to the same spec as an \\"8K\\" VZ200/Laser210. The Seltron also had the standard 16k ROM, and the motherboard allowed for the option of either a single 16Kb ROM package or 2x 8Kb ROM chip packages. Only one Seltron is known to still exist today.  Peripherals  The back panel of the VZ200 The VZ200 and VZ300 datasettes along with the VZ200 Printer Plotter Within a year of the Laser 310's release, an 80k disk drive unit was released on to the market, of which two could be connected to the computer at the same time. A plug-pack cartridge containing the DOS ROM was required to operate the drives. The DOS ROM and diskette drives were backwards compatible with the Laser 200. A number of other VTech designed plug-in peripherals were also available for both the Laser 200 and Laser 310 computers. Among them were joysticks, cassette drive, light pen, printer plotter, 75 baud MODEM, word processor cartridge, and the 16k and 64k extended RAM cartridges. As numbers of users grew, so did the number of home-made kits which were on offer, which included a Speech synthesizer, Texas Instruments SN76489AN programmable sound generator chip, EEPROM programmer, data logger, 300 baud MODEM, full 101 keyboard, and a RTTY Ham radio kit.  Software  With both of their releases in Germany, England, USA, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and a few other countries, commercially based software titles grew and were distributed throughout various outlets in their home county syets store fronts throughout Australia and New Zealand sold many titles, including educational and graphical games, finance programs and various software utility tools, most of which have been found and transferred for the use in the various emulators. Unfortunately, there are a number of known software packages that have simply been lost through the age of time. Dick Smith Electronics ran a program buying software from local programmers and selling them through their stores for $12 a cassette. Most VZ200 programs were written in Australia, it is the equivalent of the Sinclair ZX-81 in Australia (which was never really available because of production problems in the UK), a system which many early programmers learnt on. The lack of foreign competition tended to encourage local programmers, programmers having little success competing with foreign programs on the most popular system, the Commodore 64.  Emulators  A number of emulators have since been written for these models of computers: * MESS VZ/Laser emulation by Juergen Buchmueller and Dirk Best * JEMU (for Java) by Richard Wilson * JVZ200 (for Windows) by James Tamer * VZEM (Windows and DOS versions) by Guy Thomason * Pocket VZ (for the Pocket PC) by Guy Thomason * Android VZ (for the Android OS) by Guy Thomason  References   External links  * DSVZ200 – VZ200 emulator * Download page for a number of emulators * VZEM by Intertek – The official homepage of the VZEM emulator * JEMU – Java based VZ200 & VZ300 Emulator * A contemporary review – from Your Computer, April 1983 * Laser Beams in at Just £70 – from Personal Computer News, 18 August 1983 * The VZ200 – Tutorials and Programming * A VZ200 Wiki – Information * Clockmeisters VZ/Laser310 page * German VZ dedication page with 600+ German VZ software titles. * Bushy's Absolute everything VZ page. * Steve's VZ page. ;Software * Intertek's software download page * Andrew's VZ wiki download page * Bushy's VZ software download page.

The Catholic Church in Portugal is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. The Catholic Church is the world's largest Christian organisation. It is Portugal's largest religion and its former state religion, and has existed in the territory since the Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Roman Empire. There are an estimated nine million baptised Catholics in Portugal (84% of the population) in twenty dioceses, served by 2789 priests. Although a large number wish to be baptized, married in the church, and receive last rites, only 19% of the national population attend Mass and take the sacraments regularly. In 2010, the average age of priests was 62. In 2012 88% of the Portuguese population considered themselves culturally Catholic in a commissioned survey of religious attitudes sponsored by a Christian organization.EuroBarometer History Catholicism was introduced to what is now Portugal under the Roman Empire in the first half of the first millennium AD. The modern Portuguese state was founded in 1139 by Afonso Henriques during the Reconquista, in which the Catholic kingdoms of the northern Iberian Peninsula reconquered the South from the Islamic Moors. Crusaders from other Catholic realms aided the reconquest, which Portugal finished in 1249. Exploration and the creation of the Portuguese Empire from the early 15th century onward spread Catholicism to Portuguese colonies in Africa, Asia and South America. The Lusophone countries of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique, São Tomé e Principe and Timor-Leste all have Catholic majorities as a result.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/fields/2122.html#po The state of Goa, India, was also part of the Portuguese Empire and a large Goan Catholic minority remains. The Portuguese Republic, established in 1910, abolished Catholicism as state religion. The right-wing Estado Novo regime from 1932 to 1974 re-established state Catholicism, which was subsequently disestablished along with the regime. Organization Within Portugal, the hierarchy consists of archbishops and bishops. At the top of the hierarchy is the archbishop who is known as the Patriarch of Lisbon. The remainder of the dioceses of Portugal, each headed by a bishop, includes: *Lisbon (with the dignity of Patriarchate) Angra Funchal Guarda Leiria-Fátima Portalegre-Castelo Branco Santarém Setúbal *Braga Aveiro Bragança-Miranda Coimbra Lamego Porto Viana do Castelo Vila Real Viseu *Évora Beja Faro Sites Portugal is also the location of one of the major Catholic shrines and Marian pilgrimage sites, in the city of Fátima, in the municipality of Ourém, honoring Our Lady of Fátima. The northern city of Braga is an important Catholic center. A Portuguese saying which lists characteristics of different cities states that \\"Braga prays\\". Besides Braga Cathedral, it also has the sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte. One of the routes on the Way of St. James, a major Catholic pilgrimage to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain, is the Portuguese route (), starting from Lisbon Cathedral and spanning 610 km. Among those who have taken it was Queen Isabel of Portugal, who was canonized, in the 14th century. Portuguese Popes Two popes have been born in what is now Portugal, although only the latter was ever a subject of a country by that name. Damasus I was born in what is now Portugal in 306, and his reign as pope from 366 to 384 saw the Scriptures translated to Latin. He is now a Saint, with his feast celebrated on December 11. Pedro Julião, born in Lisbon around 1215, led the church as Pope John XXI from 1276 to 1277.

Following the American retreats at the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of the Clouds, George Washington left a force under Brigadier General Anthony Wayne behind to monitor and harass the British as they prepared to move on the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia. On the evening of September 20, British forces under Major General Charles Grey led a surprise attack on Wayne's encampment near the Paoli Tavern. Although there were relatively few American casualties, claims were made that the British took no prisoners and granted no quarter, and the engagement became known as the \\"Paoli Massacre.\\" Background After the American defeat at the Battle of Brandywine, American Major General George Washington was intent on accomplishing two tasks. He wanted to protect Philadelphia from British forces under the command of Lieutenant General William Howe, and he needed to replenish the rapidly dwindling supplies and munitions stored in Reading, Pennsylvania. Washington withdrew across the Schuylkill River, marched through Philadelphia, and headed northwest. Since the Schuylkill was fordable only far upstream starting at Matson's Ford (present-day Conshohocken), Washington could protect both the capital and the vital supply areas to the west from behind the river barrier. Washington reconsidered and recrossed the river to face the British, who had moved little since Brandywine, because of a shortage of wagons to carry their wounded and their baggage.McGuire, p. 30 After the Battle of the Clouds was aborted by bad weather on September 16, Washington again withdrew across the Schuylkill, leaving Brigadier General \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne's Pennsylvania Division at Chester, Pennsylvania. When the British columns passed by, Wayne followed, under orders from Washington to harass the British and attempt to capture all or part of their baggage train. Wayne assumed that his presence was undetected and camped close to the British lines in Paoli, Pennsylvania. His division consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 11th Pennsylvania Regiments, Hartley's Regiment, an attached artillery company and a small force of dragoons. All told, it was about 1,500 strong. Camped about away was William Smallwood's Maryland militia, about 2,100 relatively inexperienced troops. The British heard rumors that Wayne was in the area, and General Howe sent out scouts who reported his location near the Paoli Tavern on September 19. Since his position was just from the British camp at Tredyffrin, Pennsylvania, Howe immediately planned an attack on Wayne's relatively exposed camp. Battle At 10 p.m. on September 20, British commander Major General Charles Grey marched from the British camp and launched a surprise attack on Wayne's camp, near the General Paoli Tavern, from which the battle takes its name, located near present-day Malvern. Grey's troops consisted of the 2nd Light Infantry, a composite battalion formed from the light companies of 13 regiments, plus the 42nd and 44th Foot. Altogether, his brigade comprised some 1,200 men. To ensure that the Americans were not alerted, General Grey ordered that troops should advance with muskets unloaded and attack with the bayonet alone. In the case that loads could not be drawn from weapons, he ordered that flints should be removed instead, giving rise to the tradition this was a general order and earning the General the epithet \\"No Flints\\" Grey. In fact, Major Maitland, commanding officer 2nd Light Infantry battalion, was given permission to advance with muskets loaded, giving his personal assurance that his men could be relied on. The British forces, led by a local blacksmith forced to act as guide, approached the camp from a wood and were able to achieve complete surprise. They stormed the camp in three wavesthe 2nd Light Infantry in the lead followed by the 44th and the 42nd. Completely unprepared, Wayne's troops fled from the camp and were pursued. Near the White Horse Tavern the British encountered Smallwood's force and routed it as well. With casualties of only 4 killed and 7 wounded,McGuire p.132 the British had routed an entire American division. Historian Thomas J. McGuire says that 53 Americans were buried on the battlefield but \\"whether these were all of the American dead or only those found on the campsite-battlefield is uncertain\\".McGuire p.146 Local tradition says that 8 more Americans killed in the battle were buried at the nearby Anglican church of St. Peter-in-the-Great Valley.McGuire p.146See also 71 prisoners were taken by the British, 40 of whom were so badly wounded that they had to be left behind in nearby houses.Boatner p. 829 A total of 272 men were killed, wounded or missing from Wayne's division after the battle.McGuire p.146 McGuire reports that the highest ranking American officer killed was Major Mareen Lamar (sometimes misspelled Marien). Aftermath An official inquiry found that Wayne was not guilty of misconduct but that he had made a tactical error. Wayne was enraged and demanded a full court-martial. On November 1, a board of 13 officers declared that Wayne had acted with honor. The incident gained notoriety partly because of accounts by eyewitnesses, who claimed that the British had bayoneted or mutilated Americans who tried to surrender. Among them were the following: > I with my own Eyes, see them, cut & hack some of our poor Men to pieces > after they had fallen in their hands and scarcely shew the least Mercy to > any... :— Lt. Col. Adam Hubley, 10th PA Regiment.McGuire p. 125 > ...more than a dozen soldiers had with fixed bayonets formed a cordon round > him, and that everyone of them in sport had indulged their brutal ferocity > by stabbing him in different parts of his body and limbs ... a physician ... > examining him there was found ... 46 distinct bayonet wounds... :— William > Hutchinson, Pennsylvania Militiaman.McGuire p. 130 > The Enemy last Night at twelve o'clock attacked ... Our Men just raised from > Sleep, moved disorderly — Confusion followed ... The Carnage was very great > ... this is a bloody Month. :— Col. Thomas Hartley, 1st PA Regiment.McGuire > p. 109 > The Annals of the Age Cannot Produce such another Scene of Butchery... :— > Maj. Samuel Hay, 7th PA Regiment. The military historian Mark M. Boatner III refuted these allegations, writing: > American propagandists succeeded in whipping up anti-British sentiment with > false accusations that Grey's men had refused quarter and massacred > defenseless patriots who tried to surrender ... The \\"no quarter\\" charge is > refuted by the fact that the British took 71 prisoners. The \\"mangled dead\\" > is explained by the fact that the bayonet is a messy weapon. In any case, Wayne's troops swore revenge and \\"Remember Paoli!\\" was used by them as a battle cry at Germantown and at Stony Point. There is a tradition that, to show their defiance, the men of the 2nd Light Infantry dyed their hat feathers red so the Americans would be able to identify them. In 1833, the Light Company of the 46th Regiment of Foot were authorized to wear red cap distinctions instead of the regulation Light Infantry green,War Office WO 3/440 apparently in commemoration of this gesture, and in 1934, the Royal Berkshire Regiment, which carried on the traditions of the 49th Foot, were authorized to wear a red distinction in their head dress although, misleadingly, this was granted \\"to commemorate the role of the Light Company at the battle of Brandywine Creek\\".War Office letter No 54/OFFICERS/30 Ya (MGO.Yb); China Dragon, No 94. July 1934 In the second half of the 20th century, the descendants of both regiments wore red backing to their cap badges and did so until 2006 when The Light Infantry and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment were absorbed by The Rifles. Monument In 1877, a granite monument was erected at the site of the battle to replace an 1817 monument that was in poor condition; the Paoli monument inscription replicates the words of the 1817 monument on one side.http://pbpfinc.org/1877-monument/ It stands tall and is inscribed on all four sides. It is located in a local park in Malvern that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 as the Paoli Battlefield Site and Parade Grounds. There are two contributing buildings, two contributing sites, and five contributing objects included on the listing. They are the Paoli Battlefield Site, Paoli Parade Grounds, Paoli Massacre Monument (1817), Paoli Massacre obelisk (1877), World War I monument (1928), World War II urn (c. 1946), and caretaker's house and garage (1922).

The Act has been amended many times over Canada's history, most recently in 2000. The Canada Election Act limits spending on election advertising by interest groups, which was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in Harper v. Canada (Attorney General) (2004). It also sets out various provisions regarding the publication or broadcast of election advertising and election results. In 1989, the government of Canada appointed the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing regarding restrictions in the Elections Act inconsistent with Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In 1996, the Act was amended to establish a Register of Electors. In 2003, the Act was extended to cover the nomination contests of registered parties.Ian Stewart, Just One Vote: Jim Walding's nomination to constitutional defeat, (Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press), 2009, p. 4. In 2007, it was amended to mandate fixed election dates. Notable provisions * Section 329 of the Act outlawed publishing election results from other ridings in constituencies where polls are still open. This section was upheld by the Supreme Court in R. v. Bryan (2007), but was repealed in 2015 because the wide use of the internet and social media had made it outdated and difficult to enforce. * Section 331 forbids those who are not citizens of Canada from \\"[inducing] electors to vote or refrain from voting or vote or refrain from voting for a particular candidate\\". Violators may face fines of up to $5,000 and six months imprisonment. * Section 335 requires that all broadcasters make 6.5 hours of advertising available for purchase by political parties over the course of a general election during \\"prime time\\" (the evening hours for TV stations and specialty channels, and morning and afternoon drive for radio stations). Even broadcasters that do not ordinarily accept advertising, such as the CBC's radio services, and (since 2017) premium pay TV channels like Crave/HBO and Super Channel, are required to accept these political ads during a federal election. * Section 345 requires that all CRTC-licensed over-the-air radio and television networks, which reach the majority of Canadians in the language of broadcast, allocate free time for election broadcasts (in addition to the paid availabilities described above). However, there are no restrictions on when these free-time broadcasts must air, and most of these networks now confine them to late night.  As of 2011, the networks subject to this provision are CBC Television, Ici Radio-Canada Télé, CBC Radio One, Ici Radio-Canada Première, TVA, and V. The amount of free time per election varies by network, from roughly 3.5 hours (for the CBC's TV networks) to 62 minutes (for TVA and V).  Historically, CTV and the Radiomédia / Corus Québec radio network were also subject to free-time allocations; the Corus Québec network has since ceased operation, while CTV has not operated under a CRTC-issued national network licence since 2001 (and other \\"networks\\" such as Global have never operated under such licences). Note that there is currently no free-time allocation required for individual private radio or television stations, or cable specialty channels. * Section 482(b), which finds anyone who \\"induces a person to vote or refrain from voting or to vote or refrain from voting for a particular candidate at an election\\" guilty of intimidation of the electoral process. Anyone convicted under s. 482(b) faces, on a summary conviction, a maximum $2,000 fine, or a maximum of one year in prison, or both. On an indictment, individuals found guilty face a maximum of five years in prison, a maximum $5,000 fine, or both. Political action committees In 2015, wealthy U.S.-style political action committees (PAC) organizations were introduced to Ontario and Alberta and were expected to play a major role in Canadian political elections at the provincial and federal level. PACs are new to Canadian federal politics and are \\"technically federal non-profit corporations\\" registered with Industry Canada. The Canada Elections Act allows PACs to \\"spend up to $150,000 on third-party advertising during an election\\" but \\"spending outside the election period is [/was] unlimited.\\" up until the enactment of the Elections Modernization Act in 2018, even after which spending was nonetheless unlimited outside of the defined pre-election periods. In Ontario, the union-funded Working Families Coalition, spent millions on anti-conservative ads before the 2015 Ontario provincial elections. The left-leaning organization Engage Canada, which released its first anti-Harper attack ad early June 2015. The right-leaning Conservative PAC Foundation founded by high-profile Alberta conservatives Jonathan Denis, Brad Tennant and Zoe Addington in June 2015 will fund advertising in support of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

It was created in 1993 by Antonije Abramović, a defrocked monk of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who became the Metropolitan of Montenegro and the head of Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which claimed succession to the autocephalous Montenegrin Church which operated until the unification of the two countries Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Montenegro, later to join the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918. It has been recognized as a religious community by the government of Montenegro since 1999, and it has wide claims over the canonical jurisdiction of the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral of the Serbian Orthodox Church. According to a 2009 poll conducted by CEDEM, 29.36 percent of Montenegro's Eastern Orthodox Christians have opted for the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, while 70.64 percent have opted for or stayed with the canonical Serbian Orthodox Church. Background The Montenegrin Orthodox Church considers itself to be the sole legitimate representative of Orthodox Christianity in Montenegro, and also lays claim to all Orthodox Christian property in Montenegro that is currently in the possession of the Serbian Orthodox Church. From time to time, MOC members and supporters have attempted to claim some of these structures (mostly in the Cetinje municipal area). The Catalogue of Tzarigrad Patriarchy (April 1855), Athens Sintagma, letter of Tzarigrad Patriarch Grigorius to St. Petar I Petrovic Njegos (dated 29 January 1798), and against the claims of other documents, see here and here (a list of historical documents; external links are in Serbian) are interpreted by the MOC that the Church of Montenegro was independent and autocephalous until Yugoslav regent Alexander I of Yugoslavia abolished it and incorporated, by the decree of 17 (30) June 1920, with Serb- Orthodox churches into a Serbian Orthodox Church, an act which received subsequently canonical recognition from the Ecumenical Patriarchate. However, although initially voicing his opposition, the dethroned King Nicholas I Petrovic-Njegos, in late 1920, recognized the unification of the Serbian Orthodox Church for the \\"benefit\\" of \\"all the Serbian people\\". MOC followers also present foreign early-20th-century travelogues as supposed proofs of the church's legitimacy, claiming that in pre-Yugoslav times, the independence of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church has been confirmed as late as 1905,\\"Yugoslav Ex-Royals Demand Montenegro Castles Back\\", Balkan Insight. Retrieved on 5 March 2018. by one of the best-known and well-traveled Balkan experts from the early 20th century, Mary Edith Durham. In her book The Burden of the Balkans, published in London in 1905, Durham explained: \\"Montenegro alone kept a free and independent Slav Church, which survives to this day\\". MOC supporters present an excerpt from the 1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica as one of the proofs of legitimacy: History The Montenegrin Orthodox Church was founded in Cetinje on October 31, 1993, by Antonije Abramović, initially with the support of the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro (LSCG), a political party that existed at the time. At the time, Montenegro was part of the federal state with Serbia called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was formed a year earlier following a 1992 referendum. LSCG, a party with a pro- independence agenda, is claimed to having used MOC as a tool in their quest for Montenegrin sovereignty. At that time, the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) maintained close ties to Slobodan Milošević's administration in Serbia, and therefore the initial activities of the MOC were very sporadic. After the death of Metropolitan Antonije, he was replaced by Metropolitan Dedeić. Most liberals did not approve of this change, and their support for the church soon started to fade. By 1997, the DPS administration in Montenegro led by Milo Đukanović began to distance itself from Milošević, and started supporting and financing the Church, which received support from both the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro and the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro; however, after 2001 this support seemingly waned. By this time, LSCG had distanced itself from MOC almost completely. On January 17, 2001, MOC was officially registered as a non-governmental organization at the local department of the Montenegrin Ministry of the Interior. In the absence of any other relevant and more current piece of legislation, this registration was done by calling on the Law on the Legal Position of Religious Communities from 1977 when Montenegro was a socialist republic within SFR Yugoslavia. In 2007, MOC attempted to expand its activities beyond the borders of Montenegro. Serbia originally refused to allow MOC to be registered as an organization, as all canonical Eastern Orthodox Churches have also refused to recognize the MOC. However, on appeal, the Serbian Supreme Court ruled this position unconstitutional, overturning the refusal and paving the way for a potential permission to register. Opponents accuse it of being a group without theological purpose, and of having only political goals. Leadership MOC is led by the Archbishop of Cetinje and Montenegro Metropolitan Mihailo. At a General Montenegrin People's Assembly formed by the MOC in Cetinje on January 6, 1997, he was chosen by traditional public acclamation the Head of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. In the Church of St. Paraskeva in Sofia, on March 15, 1998, he was ordained as bishop by Bulgarian Alternative Synod's head Patriarch Pimen and seven Metropolitans and Episcops of his synod. He was enthroned to Metropolitan of Montenegrin Orthodox Church in Cetinje on October 31, 1998, in the presence of several hundred believers and supporters of Montenegrin Orthodox Church. Metropolitan Mihailo had worked as a professor for the Serbian Orthodox Church and then as a priest of the Greek Orthodox Church in Italy, where he uncanonically created a Serbian Orthodox Municipality out of the Greek Church, leading after a number of scandals, including adultery and accusations of embezzlement, to his permanent suspension from the Church in 1995. After becoming Metropolitan of the MOC in 1997, he was fully excommunicated by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople from the Eastern Orthodox Church. During his pastoral visit in Argentina in 2007, the Metropolitan Mihailo met Cardinal Bergoglio, current Pope Francis. On January 11, 2007, MOC restored its own Holy Synod and proclaimed its first decree in which it confirms its autocephalous status. The Holy Synod is constituted by archpriests of MOC, led by Metropolitan Mihailo. The Holy Synod divided Montenegro in five eparchies - Cetinjska, Dukljanska, Primorska, Ostroška and Beranska. One of the prominent members of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church was Jelisej Lalatović, a former Serb monk from Nikšić, defrocked for stealing of church property and falsification of church seals. In early 2010 he joined with the Croatian Orthodox Union for the formation of the Croatian Orthodox Church and became its chief in Zadar. Lalatović was immediately expelled from the MOC on the grounds of spreading unrest and immorality in the church, the MOC officially dismissing its connections with the formation of the COC.Vesti Online, Crnogorski raspop vraća delo Pavelića, 14. 03. 2010.Vesti Online, Jelisej isključen iz CPC zbog nemorala, 15. 03. 2010. Service In Montenegro The Montenegrin Orthodox Church currently holds its regular services in several Chapels in the area of Montenegro's royal capital, Cetinje, as well as in its newly built Temple in Kotor. Open-air services are held across Montenegro for Christmas and Easter. The MOC officially opened a new shrine in the old town of Kotor in 2006, following the referendum on independence.

A contract for the land on which the new MOC shrine will be built was signed on 5 August 2005. A list with the names of several dozen donations—from Montenegro, USA, Slovenia, Australia and Switzerland—for the construction of a MOC shrine in Serbia has also been published. MOC also has support from abroad, and it has managed to build several shrines in North America, South America, Australia, Western Europe all home to important Montenegrin émigré communities, most of whom also support the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. Services are held in the Australian state of New South Wales as well as in the Argentine province of Chaco, which is the base of Archimandrit Gorazd Glomazic and the Montenegrin Church of Saint Nikola in the colony of Machagay. Churches of the MOC outside Montenegro: *Crkva Svetog Pravednog Ivana Crnojevića, Lovćenac, Serbia *Crkva Svetog Nikole, Chaco, Argentina *Crkva Svetog Arhanđela, Venado Tuerto, Argentina Claim to Serbian Orthodox Churches In April 2007 the \\"President of the Council for the promotion\\" of the MOC, Stevo Vučinić, was quoted as saying the \\"we [the MOC] will retake of all the churches and chapels in the towns, and of course the village churches, and the monasteries...we expect resistance, but in no case will we give up\\". President of the Republic of Montenegro Filip Vujanović said that he will protect the property of the Serbian Orthodox Church, along with other administrative officials, saying that the MOC should not give up and that they should go to legal suits on specific cases. Despite this, the MOC has claimed that it does not care about anyone's opinion outside its Council calling it irrelevant and is determined to forcibly reclaim their property in Montenegro, currently occupied by SOC. On Wednesday, April 18, 2007, the representatives of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church - which has announced that it did not wish to cause an \\"excessive situation\\", but that it would enter the Serbian Orthodox Cetinje monastery without regard to the reaction of the Serbian Orthodox Church to their claims and requests - attempted to do so. Special police units prevented their forceful entry and that of several hundred supporters of the MOC. There was some pushing and shoving between the police, and the crowd which had intended to force its way into the monastery. Following this, members of the crowd shouted slogans such as \\"this isn't Serbia\\", \\"whose police are you?\\" and \\"Risto, Satan\\" (a reference to Metropolitan Amfilohije of the SOC). In September 2008, Serbian Orthodox locals attempted to launch a blockade in the Nikšić area to prevent the MOC from building a church there. Sixty five people were arrested for violating public order. Support Support from other churches The Church has support from a number of likewise non-canonical, unrecognized Eastern Orthodox Churches: the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kiev Patriarchate, the Bulgarian Alternative Orthodox Church (founded by patriarch Pimen), and its Italian- based branch, the Orthodox Church in Italy. The MOC also has support of the far right Croatian Orthodox Union NGO, which aims at creating an autocephalous Croatian Orthodox Church for the Republic of Croatia, an act which the MOC came up to as the first supporter. The MOC had original support of the unrecognized Macedonian Orthodox Church, which was later withdrawn as the Macedonian Church entered negotiations for restoration into communion. In all official Orthodox theological circles (such as the Russian Orthodox Church or the Ecumenical Patriarchate), MOC is seen as a schismatic group and a political fabrication, similar to the churches that supported it. Support from political parties Political parties in Montenegro that so far officially stated support of the MOC are: the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro and minority Croatian Civic Initiative, officially proposing it to be mentioned in Montenegro's new Constitution, which eventually did not mention it with its adoption in late 2007. The Initiative invited representatives of both the Montenegrin and Serbian churches to a special municipal meeting in Tivat, sparking a boycott among local Serbian politicians. In Serbia, the church has the support of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians which believes it should be a recognized religion in the country. Public opinion According to data of Centre of Democracy in Montenegro from February 2007, the Serbian Orthodox Church was the most trusted institution in Montenegro by public opinion (coefficient 3.29), while the Montenegrin Orthodox Church was ranked sixth (coefficient 2.35). According to a 2009 poll conducted by CEDEM, 29.36 percent of Montenegro's Eastern Orthodox Christians have opted for the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, while 70.64 percent have opted for or stayed with the canonical Serbian Orthodox Church.

This highly varied strip of epithelial cells allows for transduction of auditory signals into nerve impulses' action potential. Transduction occurs through vibrations of structures in the inner ear causing displacement of cochlear fluid and movement of hair cells at the organ of Corti to produce electrochemical signals.The Ear Pujol, R., Irving, S., 2013 Italian anatomist Alfonso Giacomo Gaspare Corti (1822–1876) discovered the organ of Corti in 1851. The structure evolved from the basilar papilla and is crucial for mechanotransduction in mammals. Structure Cross-section through the spiral organ of Corti at greater magnification, showing position of the hair cells on the basement membrane. The organ of Corti is located in the scala media of the cochlea of the inner ear between the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct and is composed of mechanosensory cells, known as hair cells. Strategically positioned on the basilar membrane of the organ of Corti are three rows of outer hair cells (OHCs) and one row of inner hair cells (IHCs). Separating these hair cells are supporting cells: Deiters cells, also called phalangeal cells, which separate and support both the OHCs and the IHCs. Projecting from the tops of the hair cells are tiny finger like projections called stereocilia, which are arranged in a graduated fashion with the shortest stereocilia on the outer rows and the longest in the center. This gradation is thought to be the most important anatomic feature of the organ of Corti because this allows the sensory cells superior tuning capability. If the cochlea were uncoiled, it would roll out to be about 33 mm long in women and 34 mm in men, with about 2.28 mm of standard deviation for the population. The cochlea is also tonotopically organized, meaning that different frequencies of sound waves interact with different locations on the structure. The base of the cochlea, closest to the outer ear, is the most stiff and narrow and is where the high-frequency sounds are transduced. The apex, or top, of the cochlea is wider and much more flexible and loose and functions as the transduction site for low-frequency sounds. Function Image showing the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear, and how sound is conducted through the outer ear, to the ossicles of the middle ear, through to the inner ear and the cochlea, where the organ of Corti sits. The function of the organ of Corti is to change (transduce) auditory signals and minimise the hair cells' extraction of sound energy. It is the auricle and middle ear that act as mechanical transformers and amplifiers so that the sound waves end up with amplitudes 22 times greater than when they entered the ear.  Auditory transduction  In normal hearing, the majority of the auditory signals that reach the organ of Corti in the first place come from the outer ear. Sound waves enter through the auditory canal and vibrate the tympanic membrane, also known as the eardrum, which vibrates three small bones called the ossicles. As a result, the attached oval window moves and causes movement of the round window, which leads to displacement of the cochlear fluid. However, the stimulation can happen also via direct vibration of the cochlea from the skull. The latter is referred to as Bone Conduction (or BC) hearing, as complementary to the first one described, which is instead called Air Conduction (or AC) hearing. Both AC and BC stimulate the basilar membrane in the same way (Békésy, G.v., Experiments in Hearing. 1960). The basilar membrane on the tympanic duct presses against the hair cells of the organ as perilymphatic pressure waves pass. The stereocilia atop the IHCs move with this fluid displacement and in response their cation, or positive ion selective, channels are pulled open by cadherin structures called tip links that connect adjacent stereocilia. The organ of Corti, surrounded in potassium-rich fluid endolymph, lies on the basilar membrane at the base of the scala media. Under the organ of Corti is the scala tympani and above it, the scala vestibuli. Both structures exist in a low potassium fluid called perilymph. Because those stereocilia are in the midst of a high concentration of potassium, once their cation channels are pulled open, potassium ions as well as calcium ions flow into the top of the hair cell. With this influx of positive ions the IHC becomes depolarized, opening voltage-gated calcium channels at the basolateral region of the hair cells and triggering the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. An electrical signal is then sent through the auditory nerve and into the auditory cortex of the brain as a neural message.  Cochlear amplification  The organ of Corti is also capable of modulating the auditory signal. The outer hair cells (OHCs) can amplify the signal through a process called electromotility where they increase movement of the basilar and tectorial membranes and therefore increase deflection of stereocilia in the IHCs. A crucial piece to this cochlear amplification is the motor protein prestin, which changes shape based on the voltage potential inside of the hair cell. When the cell is depolarized, prestin shortens, and because it is located on the membrane of OHCs it then pulls on the basilar membrane and increasing how much the membrane is deflected, creating a more intense effect on the inner hair cells (IHCs). When the cell hyperpolarizes prestin lengthens and eases tension on the IHCs, which decreases the neural impulses to the brain. In this way, the hair cell itself is able to modify the auditory signal before it even reaches the brain. Development The organ of Corti, in between the scala tympani and the scala media, develops after the formation and growth of the cochlear duct. The inner and outer hair cells then differentiate into their appropriate positions and are followed by the organization of the supporting cells. The topology of the supporting cells lends itself to the actual mechanical properties that are needed for the highly specialized sound-induced movements within the organ of Corti. Development and growth of the organ of Corti relies on specific genes, many of which have been identified in previous research (SOX2, GATA3, EYA1, FOXG1, BMP4, RAC1, and more), to undergo such differentiation. Specifically, the cochlear duct growth and the formation of hair cells within the organ of Corti. Mutations in the genes expressed in or near the organ of Corti before the differentiation of hair cells will result in a disruption in the differentiation, and potential malfunction of, the organ of Corti. Clinical significance  Hearing loss  The organ of Corti can be damaged by excessive sound levels, leading to noise-induced impairment. The most common kind of hearing impairment, sensorineural hearing loss, includes as one major cause the reduction of function in the organ of Corti. Specifically, the active amplification function of the outer hair cells is very sensitive to damage from exposure to trauma from overly-loud sounds or to certain ototoxic drugs. Once outer hair cells are damaged, they do not regenerate, and the result is a loss of sensitivity and an abnormally large growth of loudness (known as recruitment) in the part of the spectrum that the damaged cells serve. While hearing loss has always been considered irreversible in mammals, fish and birds routinely repair such damage. A 2013 study has shown that the use of particular drugs may reactivate genes normally expressed only during hair cell development. The research was carried out at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, and the Keio University School of Medicine in Japan.

Grattan-Guinness (ed.), Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences, Volume 2, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003, p. 1213. was a Russian physicist of Baltic German descent who is most noted for formulating Lenz's law in electrodynamics in 1834.Lenz, E. (1834), \\"Ueber die Bestimmung der Richtung der durch elektodynamische Vertheilung erregten galvanischen Ströme]\\", Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 107 (31), pp. 483–494. A partial translation of the paper is available in Magie, W. M. (1963), A Source Book in Physics, Harvard: Cambridge MA, pp. 511–513. Biography Lenz was born in Dorpat (nowadays Tartu, Estonia), at that time in the Governorate of Livonia in the Russian Empire. After completing his secondary education in 1820, Lenz studied chemistry and physics at the University of Dorpat. He traveled with the navigator Otto von Kotzebue on his third expedition around the world from 1823 to 1826. On the voyage Lenz studied climatic conditions and the physical properties of seawater. The results have been published in \\"Memoirs of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences\\" (1831). After the voyage, Lenz began working at the University of St. Petersburg, Russia, where he later served as the Dean of Mathematics and Physics from 1840 to 1863 and was Rector from 1863 until his death in 1865. Lenz also taught at the Petrischule in 1830 and 1831, and at the Mikhailovskaya Artillery Academy. Lenz had begun studying electromagnetism in 1831. Besides the law named in his honor, Lenz also independently discovered Joule's law in 1842; to honor his efforts on the problem, it is also given the name the \\"Joule–Lenz law,\\" named also for James Prescott Joule. Lenz eagerly participated in development of the electroplating technology, invented by his friend and colleague Moritz von Jacobi. In 1839, Lenz produced several medallions using electrotyping. Along with the electrotyped relief produced by Jacobi the same year, these were the first instances of galvanoplastic sculpture.History of electroplating in the 19th century Russia.

Originally intended as a local area network interface for use in school classrooms, it was revised before launch to also act as the controller for up to eight ZX Microdrive high-speed tape-loop cartridge drives. It also included a DE-9 RS-232 interface capable of operating at up to 19.2 kbit/s. At hardware level it was fundamentally a voltage adaptor, the serial protocol being implemented in software by bit-banging. This led to problems when receiving data, but not when transmitting. A wedge-shaped device fitting underneath the ZX Spectrum, the ZX Interface 1 contained of ROM comprising the control software for the Microdrives, an RS-232 port and network interface. This extended the error handler in the Sinclair BASIC to allow extra keywords to be used. As this became an official standard, other developers quickly used this mechanism to create language extensions to Sinclair BASIC. Two further revisions of the device's firmware were made following launch.Interface 1, Issue 10, December 1984, Your Spectrum 10 These aimed to improve ZX Microdrive cartridge formatting and access time, printing functions via the RS-232 interface, and other bugs in the firmware held in the device's internal 8K ROM. Machine code software which used the officially documented entry points ('hook codes') would experience few incompatibility issues; however, programs using non-standard entry points risked incompatibility due to the presence of revised entry points. The same protocol, renamed QLAN, was later used on the Sinclair QL. This was intended to be interoperable with ZX Net, but due to timing differences interoperability was found to be problematic. The ZX Interface 1 was incompatible with some later ZX Spectrum models such as the +2A and +3, due to differences in ROM and in the expansion connector. It was therefore impossible to connect and use the Microdrive units with these later models. It did, however work with the original +2, although the much larger case made the interface an awkward fit.  Network  ZX Spectrum peripheral ZX Interface 1 rear The device offered two network ports, allowing up to 64 ZX Spectrums to be daisy-chained using network leads up to long. The network, called ZX Net, used a bidirectional wire with a proprietary CSMA-like protocol. Data could be sent or received at either to or from a numbered workstation, or broadcast to all nodes, allowing one machine to act as a server. Station number 0 is used to indicate broadcast. Data is transmitted in packets, each a maximum of 255 bytes long; the packet and the header are protected by a checksum. Character transmission uses 1 start bit, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit (the common 8-N-1 configuration).

C. Horowitz (ed.), New Dictionary of the History of Ideas, , vol.1, p. 5 The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early German Romanticism, such as Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder, Ludwig Tieck and E. T. A. Hoffmann but the term was not coined until 1846 where it was first used by Richard Wagner in a programme to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The aesthetic ideas underlying the absolute music derive from debates over the relative value of what were known in the early years of aesthetic theory as the fine arts. Kant, in his Critique of Aesthetic Judgment, dismissed music as \\"more enjoyment than culture\\" because of its lack of conceptual content, thus treating as a deficit the very feature of music that others celebrated. Johann Gottfried Herder, in contrast, regarded music as the highest of the arts because of its spirituality, which Herder attributed to the invisibility of sound. The ensuing arguments among musicians, composers, music historians and critics have, in effect, never stopped.  Spiritualist debate  A group of Romantics consisting of Johann Gottfried Herder, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Jean Paul Richter and E.T.A. Hoffmann gave rise to the idea of what can be labeled as \\"spiritual absolutism\\". In this respect, instrumental music transcends other arts and languages to become the discourse of a 'higher realm' – rooted greatly in Hoffmann’s famous review of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony, published in 1810. These protagonists believed that music could be more emotionally powerful and stimulating without words. According to Richter, music would eventually 'outlast' the word. Formalist debate Formalism is the concept of music for music's sake and refers to instrumental music. In this respect, music has no extra-musical meaning at all and is enjoyed by appreciation of its formal structure and technical construction. The 19th century music critic Eduard Hanslick argued that music could be enjoyed as pure sound and form, that it needed no connotation of extra-musical elements to warrant its existence. He argued that in fact, these extra-musical ideas and images detracted from the beauty of the music. The Absolute, in this case, is the purity of the art. Formalism therefore rejected genres such as opera, song and tone poems as they conveyed explicit meanings or programmatic imagery. Symphonic forms were considered more aesthetically pure. (The choral finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, as well as the programmatic Sixth Symphony, became problematic to formalist critics who had championed the composer as a pioneer of the Absolute, especially with the late Beethoven string quartets). Carl Dahlhaus describes absolute music as music without a \\"concept, object, and purpose\\". Opposition and objections to absolute music The majority of opposition to the idea of instrumental music being 'absolute' came from Richard Wagner. It seemed ludicrous to him that art could exist without meaning; for him it had no right to exist. Wagner considered the choral finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony to be the proof that music works better with words, famously saying: \\"Where music can go no further, there comes the word ... the word stands higher than the tone.\\" Wagner also called Beethoven's Ninth Symphony the death knell of the symphony, for he was far more interested in combining all forms of art with his . Contemporary views Today, the debate continues over whether music has meaning or not. However, most contemporary views, reflecting ideas emerging from views of subjectivity in linguistic meaning arising in cognitive linguistics, as well as Kuhn's work on cultural biases in science and other ideas on meaning and aesthetics (e.g. Wittgenstein on cultural constructions in thought and language ), appear to be moving towards a consensus that music provides at least some signification or meaning, in terms of which it is understood. The cultural bases of musical understanding have been highlighted in Philip Bohlman's work, who considers music as a form of cultural communication: Bohlman has gone on to argue that the use of music, e.g. among the Jewish diaspora, was in fact a form of identity building. Susan McClary has criticised the notion of 'absolute music', arguing that all music, whether explicitly programmatic or not, contains implicit programs that reflect the tastes, politics, aesthetic philosophies and social attitudes of the composer and their historical situation. Such scholars would argue that classical music is rarely about nothing, but reflects aesthetic tastes that are themselves influenced by culture, politics and philosophy. Composers are often bound up in a web of tradition and influence, in which they strive to consciously situate themselves in relation to other composers and styles. Lawrence Kramer, on the other hand, believes music has no means to reserve a \\"specific layer or pocket for meaning. Once it has been brought into sustainable connection with a structure of prejudgment, music simply becomes meaningful.\\" Music which appears to demand an interpretation, but is abstract enough to warrant objectivity (e.g. Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony), is what Lydia Goehr refers to as 'double-sided autonomy'. This happens when the formalist properties of music became attractive to composers because, having no meaning to speak of, music could be used to envision an alternative cultural and/or political order, while escaping the scrutiny of the censor (particularly common in Shostakovich, most notably the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies). Linguistic meaning On the topic of musical meaning, Wittgenstein, at several points in his late diary Culture and Value, ascribes meaning to music, for instance, that in the finale, a conclusion is being drawn, e.g.: Jerrold Levinson has drawn extensively on Wittgenstein to comment: See also Art music *Impressionist music *Musique concrète (\\"Concrete music\\") References Further reading *Chua, Daniel Absolute Music and the Construction of Meaning (Cambridge University Press, 1999) *Cook, Nicholas Music: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 1998) *Dahlhaus, Carl The Idea of Absolute Music trans. by Roger Lustig (Chicago/London 1989; orig.

The Grizzly was to have been fitted with a forward-firing 75 mm cannon, to penetrate heavily armored targets. While the first prototype flew on 7 May 1944, testing established that the type would not be ready for the projected invasion of Japan. It also featured the Wright R-3350 engines already in use with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress—which had priority. Consequently, the XA-38 was canceled after a second prototype had been completed. Design and development The United States Army Air Forces awarded the Beech Aircraft Corporation a contract in December 1942 for two prototypes for their Model 28 \\"Destroyer\\". Initially the Model 28 had been a bomber-destroyer design but shifted to give a powerful ground attack aircraft to replace the Douglas A-20 Havoc, with the ability to hit \\"hardened\\" targets like tanks and bunkers. This capability was achieved through a 75 mm cannon with 20 rounds, mounted in a fixed position on the nose as well as two .50 cal (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns firing forward. Defensive armament consisted of remotely controlled ventral and dorsal turrets, each armed with twin .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns. There were to be two crew members, a pilot and an observer/gunner in the rear cabin, using periscope sights to aim the guns. Testing On 7 May 1944, Beech test pilot Vern Carstens flew the XA-38 on its maiden flight from the company's Wichita airfield. The aircraft proved satisfactory in all respects and better than expected in some, including top speed. During testing, the XA-38 prototypes were flown by USAAF pilots and serviced by military personnel, proving to be reliable and establishing a high level of serviceability. The armament proved especially effective and had it not been for wartime priorities shifting in 1944, the aircraft would most likely have been ordered in quantity despite the B-29 having priority for the Wright R-3350 engines. Instead, one prototype was scrapped and the other, intended for the USAF Museum, had an unknown fate.

The screenplay was written by Richard Flournoy. The plot involves the Bumsteads' fifth anniversary, Dagwood trying to get a raise, and Blondie trying to buy new furniture. This was the first of 28 films based on the comic strip; Columbia Pictures produced them from 1938 to 1943, and popular demand brought them back in 1945. When the Blondie film series came to an end with Beware of Blondie in 1950, it was announced as being replaced with a series of Gasoline Alley movies. However, only two such films were made, Gasoline Alley (1951) and Corky of Gasoline Alley (1951). Columbia then reissued the Blondie features, beginning with the first film in the series. Columbia used the series to showcase many of its contract players. Rita Hayworth was featured in Blondie on a Budget; Glenn Ford in Blondie Plays Cupid, Larry Parks and Janet Blair in Blondie Goes to College, Shemp Howard in Blondie Knows Best, and Adele Jergens in Blondie's Anniversary. Other roles were taken by Columbia contractees Doris Houck, Bruce Bennett, Lloyd Bridges, Ann Doran, Stanley Brown, Richard Fiske, Bud Jamison, Eddie Laughton, John Tyrrell, Alyn Lockwood, Jimmy Lloyd, Gay Nelson, and Ross Ford.

The division was formed in 1913 and it operated under this name until 1921, when it became the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy. History Originally the British Royal Navy provided total security for the colony of New Zealand, but in 1846 the settlers bought a gunboat. The Waikato Flotilla operated from 1860, and at the same time a Naval Artillery Volunteer corps was established to provide harbour defence. In 1884 the government purchased four spar torpedo boats, and starting in 1887 it funded ships of the Australasian Auxiliary Squadron. Before establishment of the navy, the people of New Zealand paid for the building of the battlecruiser HMS New Zealand, which was at the Battle of Jutland. In 1912 the then New Zealand Minister of Defence, James Allen, argued in London for the creation of a New Zealand division of the Royal Navy. Though this was opposed by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, the Naval Defence Act of 1913 brought the division into existence. Encyclopaedia of New Zealand: Allen, Sir James GCMG KCB The Naval Defence Act authorised the Government to establish a naval force organisation which would pass to the control of the Admiralty in the event of war. Encyclopaedia of New Zealand: Defence organisation The division was to be funded by the New Zealand government. The light cruiser HMS Philomel was purchased from the Royal Navy to function as a training ship. In 1913 it became the first boat to be commissioned, under the command of Percival Hall- Thompson,Ian McGibbon. Hall-Thompson, Percival Henry - Biography Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Updated 1 September 2010. into the New Zealand navy. Philomel escorted New Zealand land forces to occupy the German colony of Samoa in 1914 and saw further action under the command of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf.

They played a mix of hardcore punk and ska (sometimes known as ska-core). Following the breakup of the band, which occurred the same day as the recording of their only studio album No Gods, No Managers, members went on to form Leftöver Crack and INDK, among others. Background The band became well-known at the C-Squat in the Lower East Side of Manhattan for their innovative music and politically charged lyrics. They also became infamous for their Satanic imagery and references to the vagrant lifestyle, including smoking both crack cocaine and marijuana, shoplifting, and squatting. The band prides itself on its atheism, and makes frequent references to Satan. On the album No Gods, No Managers, they use excerpts from the lectures of political scientist Michael Parenti.  Breakup  Choking Victim broke up after the first day of recording for their first full-length LP, No Gods, No Managers, but the recordings from that one day were enough to make a full album. After they broke up, Stza formed the band Leftöver Crack, and Skwert and Ezra formed INDK. Ezra joined Leftover Crack in 2001. Skwert is currently the front man for the NJ based ska punk band Public Serpents. Sascha has spent the last several years organically farming in upstate NY, and is a founding member of Icarus Project, a radical mental health network.  Reunions  On November 11, 2000, Choking Victim reunited to play a show in Tompkins Square Park with the lineup from their album, substituting former bassist Alec for Shayne. Later, in late 2005, Choking Victim reunited a second time, performing four shows. On June 11, 2006, they played a show at the Lower East Side's Tompkins Square Park, which featured various political speakers, including members of the Mislead Youth Project. At the end of July 2006, they toured the Dominican Republic, before Leftöver Crack embarked on their European Tour. In the Summer of 2012, lead singer Stza enlisted the help of Irish Ska/Punk band Chewing on Tinfoil and formed \\"The Choking Victim Show\\". This band, playing the songs of Choking Victim, toured throughout the UK, Ireland and France Choking Victim has continued to play sporadic concerts worldwide between 2014 and 2017. Prior to 2017 these were one-off events, but, in 2017, they undertook their first tour in over a decade.  Legacy  In addition to Leftöver Crack and INDK, Choking Victim also spawned Public Serpents, Morning Glory and the Crack Rock Steady 7. Choking Victim have reformed for a few dates in the UK and Europe as The Choking Victim Show with Stza, Sascha, Alec and Ezra.

Hormone receptors are a wide family of proteins made up of receptors for thyroid and steroid hormones, retinoids and Vitamin D, and a variety of other receptors for various ligands, such as fatty acids and prostaglandins. There are two main classes of hormone receptors. Receptors for peptide hormones tend to be cell surface receptors built into the plasma membrane of cells and are thus referred to as trans membrane receptors. An example of this is insulin. Receptors for steroid hormones are usually found within the cytoplasm and are referred to as intracellular or nuclear receptors, such as testosterone. Upon hormone binding, the receptor can initiate multiple signaling pathways, which ultimately leads to changes in the behavior of the target cells. Hormonal therapy and hormone receptors play a very large part in breast cancer treatment (therapy is not limited to only breast cancer). By influencing the hormones, the cells' growth can be changed along with its function. These hormones can cause cancer to not survive in the human body.  General ligand binding  Signal molecule binds to its hormone receptor, inducing a conformational change in the receptor to begin a signaling cascade that induces a cellular response. Hormone receptor proteins bind to a hormone as a result of an accumulation of weak interactions. Because of the relatively large size of enzymes and receptors, the large amount of surface area provides the basis for these weak interactions to occur. This binding is actually highly specific because of the complementarity of these interactions between polar, non-polar, charged, neutral, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic residues. Upon binding, the receptor often undergoes a conformational change and may bind further, signaling ligands to activate a signaling pathway. Because of these highly specific and high affinity interactions between hormones and their receptors, very low concentrations of hormone can produce significant cellular response. Receptors can have various different structures depending on the function of the hormone and the structure of its ligand. Therefore, hormone binding to its receptor is a complex process that can be mediated by cooperative binding, reversible and irreversible interactions, and multiple binding sites.  Functions   Transmission of signal  The presence of hormone or multiple hormones enables a response in the receptor, which begins a cascade of signaling. The hormone receptor interacts with different molecules to induce a variety of changes, such as an increase or decrease of nutrient sources, growth, and other metabolic functions. These signaling pathways are complex mechanisms mediated by feedback loops where different signals activate and inhibit other signals. If a signaling pathway ends with the increase in production of a nutrient, that nutrient is then a signal back to the receptor that acts as a competitive inhibitor to prevent further production. Signaling pathways regulate cells through activating or inactivating gene expression, transport of metabolites, and controlling enzymatic activity to manage growth and functions of metabolism.  Intracellular (nuclear receptors)  Intracellular and nuclear receptors are a direct way for the cell to respond to internal changes and signals. Intracellular receptors are activated by hydrophobic ligands that pass through the cellular membrane. All nuclear receptors are very similar in structure, and are described with intrinsic transcriptional activity. Intrinsic transcriptional involves the three following domains: transcription- activating, DNA-binding, and ligand-binding. These domains and ligands are hydrophobic and are able to travel through the membrane. The movement of macromolecules and ligand molecules into the cell enables a complex transport system of intracellular signal transfers through different cellular environments until response is enabled. Nuclear receptors are a special class of intracellular receptor that specifically aid the needs of the cell to express certain genes. Nuclear receptors often bind directly to DNA by targeting specific DNA sequences in order to express or repress transcription of nearby genes.  Trans-membrane receptors  The extracellular environment is able to induce changes within the cell. Hormones, or other extracellular signals, are able to induce changes within the cell by binding to membrane-bound receptors. This interaction allows the hormone receptor to produce second messengers within the cell to aid response. Second messengers may also be sent to interact with intracellular receptors in order to enter the complex signal transport system that eventually changes cellular function. G-protein-coupled membrane receptors(GPCR) are a major class of transmembrane receptors. The features of G proteins include GDP/GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis and guanosine nucleotide exchange. When a ligand binds to a GPCR the receptor changes conformation, which makes the intracellular loops between the different membrane domains of the receptor interact with G proteins. This interaction causes the exchange of GDP for GTP, which triggers structural changes within the alpha subunit of the G protein. The changes interrupts the interaction of the alpha subunit with the beta–gamma complex and which results in a single alpha subunit with GTP bound and a beta–gamma dimer. The GTP–alpha monomer interacts with a variety of cellular targets. The beta–gamma dimer also can stimulate enzymes within the cells for example, adenylate cyclase but it does not have as many targets as the GTP–alpha complex.  Aiding gene expression  Hormone receptors can behave as transcription factors by interacting directly with DNA or by cross-talking with signaling pathways. This process is mediated through co-regulators. In the absence of ligand, receptor molecules bind corepressors to repress gene expression, compacting chromatin through histone deacetylatase. When a ligand is present, nuclear receptors undergo a conformational change to recruit various coactivators. These molecules work to remodel chromatin. Hormone receptors have highly specific motifs that can interact with coregulator complexes. This is the mechanism through which receptors can induce regulation of gene expression depending on both the extracellular environment and the immediate cellular composition. Steroid hormones and their regulation by receptors are the most potent molecule interactions in aiding gene expression. Problems with nuclear receptor binding as a result of shortages of ligand or receptors can have drastic effects on the cell. The dependency on the ligand is the most important part in being able to regulate gene expression, so the absence of ligand is drastic to this process. For example, estrogen deficiency is a cause of osteoporosis and the inability to undergo a proper signaling cascade prevents bone growth and strengthening. Deficiencies in nuclear receptor- mediated pathways play a key role in the development of disease, like osteoporosis.  Classification   Receptors for water-soluble hormones  Water-soluble hormones include glycoproteins, catecholamines, and peptide hormones composed of polypeptides, e.g. thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle- stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and insulin. These molecules are not lipid-soluble and therefore cannot diffuse through cell membranes. Consequently, receptors for peptide hormones are located on the plasma membrane because they have bound to a receptor protein located on the plasma membrane. Water-soluble hormones come from amino acids and are located and stored in endocrine cells until actually needed. The main two types of transmembrane receptor hormone receptor are the G-protein-coupled receptors and the enzyme-linked receptors. These receptors generally function via intracellular second messengers, including cyclic AMP (cAMP), cyclic GMP (cGMP), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the calcium (Ca2+)-calmodulin system. Receptors for lipid-soluble hormones Cartoon representation of the human hormone estrogen receptor DBD. DNA = orange and blue. DBD of estrogen receptor = white. Zinc atoms = green. Steroid hormone receptors and related receptors are generally soluble proteins that function through gene activation. Lipid-soluble hormones target specific sequences of DNA by diffusing into the cell. When they have diffused into the cell, they bind to receptors (intracellular), and migrate into the nucleus. heir response elements are DNA sequences (promoters) that are bound by the complex of the steroid bound to its receptor. The receptors themselves are zinc-finger proteins. These receptors include those for glucocorticoids (glucocorticoid receptors), estrogens (estrogen receptors), androgens (androgen receptors), thyroid hormone (T3) (thyroid hormone receptors), calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) (calcitriol receptors), and the retinoids (vitamin A) (retinoid receptors). Receptor-protein interactions induce the uptake and destruction of their respective hormones in order to regulate their concentration in the body. This is especially important for steroid hormones because many body systems are entirely steroid dependent.  List of hormone receptors  For some of these classes, in any given species (such as, for example, humans), there is a single molecule encoded by a single gene; in other cases, there are several molecules in the class. * Androgen receptors * Calcitriol receptors * Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 * Corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2 * Estrogen receptors * Follicle-stimulating hormone receptors * Glucagon receptors * Gonadotropin receptors * Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors * Growth hormone receptors *Insulin receptor * Luteinizing hormone * Progesterone receptors * Retinoid receptors * Somatostatin receptors * Thyroid hormone receptors * Thyrotropin receptors  References  Category:Receptors Category:Integral membrane proteins ","title":"Hormone receptor"},{"id":"563600","text":"Louis Orth Kelso (; December 4, 1913 – February 17, 1991) was a political economist, corporate and financial lawyer, author, lecturer and merchant banker who is chiefly remembered today as the inventor and pioneer of the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), invented to enable working people without savings to buy stock in their employer company and pay for it out of its future dividend yield. Biography He was born on December 4, 1913 in Denver, Colorado. Kelso began to think seriously about economics in 1931, during the Great Depression. He was determined to launch his own investigation into the cause of a phenomenon no one was able to explain to his satisfaction. This quest took him to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where in 1937 he was graduated with a B.S. degree in business administration and finance; he went on to law school in Boulder, receiving a J.D. in 1938. He then joined a Denver law firm, Pershing, Bosworth, Dick & Dawson from 1938 to 1942. Then came Pearl Harbor. Kelso was commissioned in the U.S. Naval Service, and assigned to intelligence duty first in San Francisco and then in the Canal Zone. Working tropical hours, Kelso used his free afternoons to work on his seminal manuscript, The Fallacy of Full Employment. With the war over, the completed manuscript in his footlocker, the Navy sent him back to civilian life in 1946. But 1946 was also the year the Congress passed the Full Employment Act. This legislation, still in force, defines economic policy in the United States 170 years after the official birth of the Industrial Revolution as the right to a job. Kelso concluded that the time for his ideas had not yet come. He then taught constitutional law at University of Colorado at Boulder. He then moved to San Francisco, California. There he became a law partner with Kelso, Cotton, Seligman & Ray. He died on February 17, 1991 at the Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, California. Development of ESOPs Kelso created the ESOP in 1956 to enable the employees of a closely held newspaper chain to buy out its retiring owners. Two years later Kelso and his co-author, the philosopher Mortimer J. Adler, explained the macro-economic theory on which the ESOP is based in The Capitalist Manifesto (Random House, 1958). In The New Capitalists (Random House, 1961), the two authors present Kelso's financial tools for democratizing capital ownership in a private property, market economy. These ideas were further elaborated and refined in Two-Factor Theory: The Economics of Reality (Random House, 1967) and Democracy and Economic Power: Extending the ESOP Revolution Through Binary Economics (1986, Ballinger Publishing Company, Cambridge, Massachusetts; reprinted 1991, University Press of America, Lanham, Maryland), both co-authored by Patricia Hetter Kelso, his collaborator since 1963. Kelso's next financing innovation, the Consumer Stock Ownership Plan (CSOP), in 1958 enabled a consortium of farmers in the Central Valley to finance and start up an anhydrous ammonia fertilizer plant. Despite fierce opposition from the major oil companies who dominated the industry, Valley Nitrogen Producers was a resounding success. Substantial dividends first paid for the stock and then drastically reduced fertilizer costs for the farmer-shareholders. Kelso regarded the ESOP and CSOP as pragmatic proof that his revolutionary revision of classical economic theory, and the financial techniques he derived from this new perspective, were sound and workable in the economic and business world. Kelso gained that worldly knowledge from his work as a corporate and financial lawyer, and later as senior partner in the law firm he founded. He was further motivated by his conviction that lawyers had a special responsibility to maintain and improve society's institutions in the light of its democratic values. He further believed that the business corporation was society's greatest social invention and that its executives had a fiduciary responsibility in exercising its vast power. Kelso long believed that he had not originated a new economic theory but only discovered a vital fact that the classical economists had somehow overlooked. This fact was the key to understanding why the private property, free market economy was notoriously unstable, pursuing a roller coaster course of exhilarating highs and terrifying descents into economic and financial collapse. This missing fact, which Kelso had uncovered over years of intensive reading, research and thought, drastically modifies the classical paradigm which has dominated formal economics since Adam Smith. It concerns the effect of technological change on the distributive dynamics of a private property, free market economy. Technological change, Kelso concluded, makes tools, machines, structures and processes ever more productive while leaving human productivity largely unchanged. The result is that primary distribution through the free market economy (whose distributive principle is \\"to each according to his production\\") delivers progressively more market-sourced income to capital owners and progressively less to workers who make their contributions through labor. Differential productiveness over time concentrates market-sourced income in the hands of those who will not recycle it back through the market as payment for consumer goods and services. They already have most of what they want and need, so they invest their excess in new productive power. This is the source of the distributional bottleneck which makes the private property, free market economy ever more dysfunctional. The symptoms of dysfunction are capital concentration and inadequate consumer demand, the effects of which translate into poverty and economic insecurity for the majority of people who depend entirely on wage income and cannot survive more than a week or two without a paycheck. And since, as Adam Smith laid down, economic demand begins with the consumer and consumer purchasing power, the production side of the economy is under-nourished and hobbled. All of Kelso's financing tools and economic proposals are designed to correct the imbalance between production and consumption at its source, in conformity with the private property/free market principles identified by Smith and his followers. In a biographical summary written for the National Center for Employee Ownership in 1988, Kelso described \\"the area in which first I alone, and then, beginning about 25 years ago, Patricia and I, have made our contribution to the world of economics and corporate (and other) finance. The Kelso contribution lies partly in the area of macro-economic discovery, and partly in practical ways to implement and make good use of those discoveries in human affairs.\\" Although going along with Random House's cold-war title, The Capitalist Manifesto, Kelso and Adler believed that capitalist was not the right term. But they could not come up with a better one. In their book they had called Kelso's new concept the theory of capitalism. Later Kelso and Hetter, wrestling with the same semantic problem, came up with the term universal capitalism. Not until after their last book was already in print did Kelso discover the term they had been searching for all along: binary economics. Kelso & Company In 1971, Louis Kelso founded Kelso Bangert & Company as a merchant bank that would be both an advisor and investor in mergers and acquisitions involving employee stock ownership plans. The firm, which would later come to be known as Kelso & Company, would transition toward private equity investments in the late 1970s and would raise its first private equity fund in 1980. Today Kelso & Company is a $10 billion private equity firm and was among the 50 largest private equity firms globally.

Unlike the other gates of the Forbidden City, the Meridian Gate has two protruding arms on either side, derived from ancient que towers traditionally used to decorate the main entrances of palaces, temples and tombs. The gate has five arches. The three central arches are close together in the main, central section; the two flanking arches are farther apart from the three central arches, and are located between the central section and the protruding arms. The centre arch was formerly reserved for the Emperor alone; the exceptions were the Empress, who could enter it once on the day of her wedding, and the top three scholars of the triennial civil service examinations, who left the exams through the central arch. All other officials and servants had to use the four side arches. A series of buildings form the superstructure of the gate. The central one is a pavilion of nine bays wide, with double eaves. On each of the protruding side, a 13 bays-long building with a single eave, connects the two pyramidal-roofed pavilions that represented the que towers. Its superstructure is also called the \\"Five Phoenix Turrets\\" because it is composed of five buildings. Imperial proclamations and almanacs were issued from the gate house. After successful campaigns, the Emperor received prisoners of war here, sometimes followed by mass decapitations. Although urban myth has it that senior officers were executed here in Imperial China; in reality only corporal punishment was actually carried out.

His first appearance was in The Flash #112 (May 12, 1960). The character has won and been nominated for several awards over the years, including winning the 1961 Alley Award for \\"Best Supporting Character.\\" Publication history The Elongated Man was created by writer John Broome and penciler Carmine Infantino, with significant input from editor Julius Schwartz, who wanted a new supporting character for the Flash. Julius Schwartz has noted that the Elongated Man was only created because he had not realized that Plastic Man was available due to character rights having been obtained by DC in 1956 (along with other Quality Comics properties). However, Infantino and inker Murphy Anderson stated that he never used him as a reference for anything. In his 2000 autobiography, The Amazing World of Carmine Infantino, the artist wrote, \\"I really liked Elongated Man because it was comical and I enjoyed drawing comedy. It was also one of my favorite strips, because it was as close to animation as I could do in a comic book. I liked being able to test the limits of the comic book form and this strip allowed me to do that.\\" The Elongated Man received a solo backup feature in Detective Comics, where he was redefined as a detective who loves odd mysteries and travels the United States in a convertible with his wife, searching for them. Sometimes they would travel the world or meet other DC superheroes like Batman, Green Lantern, the Atom and Zatanna. This feature became sporadic during the late '60s and throughout the '70s. However, in 1973, he became a member of the Justice League of America, and he is mostly seen in that title from 1973 to 1995. Fictional character biography As a teenager, Ralph Dibny was fascinated by contortionists, or people who displayed feats of agility and suppleness. He learned that all of the body- benders he spoke with drank a popular soda called \\"Gingold\\". Ralph set to work learning chemistry and developed a super-concentrated extract of the rare \\"gingo\\" fruit of the Yucatan, which gave him his elasticity. In his first appearance, the Flash suspects the Elongated Man is behind several crimes, but the Elongated Man helps capture the criminals, who reveal they used a helicopter to frame him. Ralph Dibny was one of the earliest Silver Age DC heroes to reveal his secret identity to the public, and also one of the first to marry his love interest. After teaming up with several other superheroes like Batman, Green Lantern, the Atom, Zatanna and the Justice League of America, he became a member of the team. Eventually, his wife became a member as well. The couple was also notable in having a stable, happy, and relatively trouble-free marriage—an anomaly in the soap operatic annals of superhero comic books. Identity Crisis Ralph Dibny played a central role in the events of Identity Crisis, with the main arc of the series revolving around the DC Universe's response to the murder of Sue Dibny. The healthy, stable relationship between Ralph and Sue, and the events that led to and resulted from her death, were used as primary narrative devices throughout the series for examining the respective personal relationships of other JLA and JSA members (and to a lesser extent, members of the supervillain community). The effect of Sue's death on Ralph (compounded by the fact that Sue was apparently pregnant at the time of her death) would come to shape his character significantly in the events following Identity Crisis, eventually culminating at the end of the weekly series 52. Ralph and Sue appeared as members of the Justice League offshoot the Super Buddies in the miniseries Formerly Known as the Justice League and its sequel story arc \\"I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League\\" published in JLA: Classified #4-9. The latter arc was produced before Identity Crisis, but published afterwards. A running joke in \\"I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League\\" involves the possibility of Sue's pregnancy. 52 In the 2006 weekly series 52, a grief-stricken Ralph Dibny is contemplating suicide when he is informed that Sue's gravestone has been vandalized52 Week One (May 10, 2006) with an inverted version of Superman's 'S' symbol—the Kryptonian symbol for resurrection. He confronts Cassandra Sandsmark,52 Week Two (May 17, 2006) and she tells Dibny that she is in a cult that believes that Superboy can be resurrected. She steals Ralph's wedding ring after the cult members try to drown Ralph.52 Week Four (May 31, 2006) During Week 11, after scaring some cult members and chasing them off, he gets a report that someone broke into a storage container in Opal City and stole Sue's clothes.52 Week Eleven (July 19, 2006) In Week 12, Ralph finds Wonder Girl and she tells him they stole the clothes and ring to make a Sue dummy. She invites him to the ceremony.52 Week Twelve (July 26, 2006) During Week 13, Ralph goes to the ceremony. Metamorpho, the Green Arrow, Zauriel, and Hal Jordan come with him. Despite his initial agreement, Dibny and his friends disrupt the ceremony, but the effigy of Sue crawls to Dibny and calls out to him as it burns; Dibny suffers a nervous breakdown as a result.52 Week Thirteen (August 2, 2006) During Week 18, other members of the Croatoan Society (Detective Chimp, Terri Thirteen, and Edogawa Sangaku) find Tim Trench dead with the helmet of Doctor Fate, Nabu. Ralph comes to investigate and asks for help from the Shadowpact, Detective Chimp's other group. A voice from within the helm of Doctor Fate, unheard by the other members of the group, speaks to Dibny and promises to fulfill his desires if he makes certain sacrifices.52 Week Eighteen (September 6, 2006) Dibny journeys with the helm through the afterlives of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic. During Week 27, the Spectre promises to resurrect Sue in exchange for Dibny's taking vengeance on Jean Loring, but Dibny is unable to do so.52 Week Twenty-Seven (November 8, 2006) During Week 32, Ralph ventures to Nanda Parbat and gets into a fight with the Yeti. The Perfect Accomplished Physician comes to the rescue. Both he and the Yeti are members of the Great Ten, defenders of China. At Nanda Parbat, Rama Kushna tells Dibny, \\"The end is already written\\".52 Week Thirty-Two (December 13, 2006) During week 42, Dibny is in Dr. Fate's tower. He begins the spell to resurrect Sue, puts on the helmet of Fate, and shoots it, revealing Felix Faust, who was posing as Nabu. Faust planned to trade Dibny's soul to Neron in exchange for his own freedom. Ralph reveals that he was aware of Faust's identity for some time, and that the binding spell surrounding the tower is designed to imprison Faust, not to counter any negative effects of the spell. Neron appears and kills Dibny, only to realize too late that the binding spell responds only to Dibny's commands: through his death, Ralph has trapped Faust and Neron in the tower, seemingly for all eternity, though his methods of doing so are unknown.52 Week Forty-Two (February 21, 2007) His spirit is later seen reunited with his wife.52 Week Fifty-Two (May 2, 2007) However, Neron is able to escape almost immediately. During the Black Adam: The Dark Ages miniseries, Faust is shown to escape with the help of Black Adam and a resurrected Isis, who is under Faust's mental control. These events take place just prior to Countdown, indicating that Faust had only been there for a few weeks. At the end of Week 52, it is revealed that Dibny's magical, wish-granting gun (a souvenir from \\"the Anselmo Case\\", a reference to The Life Story of the Flash) worked——Ralph's last wish was to be reunited with his wife, even in death——and that Ralph and Sue are now reunited as ghost detectives, investigating a school where a paranormal phenomenon has just occurred. One Year Later In Blue Beetle #16, Traci 13 mentioned that she had been taken in by Ralph and Sue after her mother died. In the 2007-08 Black Adam miniseries Dark Ages, it is shown that Ralph's remains are still inside Fate's Tower when Teth-Adam asks Faust if his deal to trick Dibny had worked. Ralph's skeleton is used by Faust to create the illusion that Adam's attempt at resurrecting Isis had failed. In Batman and the Outsiders (vol. 2) #5, it is revealed (after appearing unknown in the previous two issues) that Ralph and Sue have gained or discovered the ability to possess human bodies, like the ability of Boston Brand, a.k.a. Deadman. Reign in Hell Ralph and Sue, in their ghostly forms, appear before Doctor Occult with news of the war brewing in Hell. Sent by Giovanni \\"John\\" Zatara who, as a member of the Hell Resistance Movement, hopes to take advantage of the war, they ask Doctor Occult to aid him in his plan. They then dissipate and leave him to make his decision.Reign in Hell #1 (September 2008) Blackest Night In Blackest Night #0, Ralph and Sue Dibny's graves are shown during Black Hand's chant. At the end of the issue (in the promotional profile image of the Black Lantern Corps) his hand is easily identifiable as popping out of its grave. Ralph and Sue's corpses are revealed as having been reanimated as Black Lanterns, attacking Hawkman and Hawkgirl; Ralph beating Hawkman with his mace before ripping out Hawkman's heart.Blackest Night #1 (July 2009) Next, they are seen in Gotham City with the Black Lanterns the Martian Manhunter, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, and Firestorm preparing to kill the Flash and Green Lantern.Blackest Night #2 (August 2009) He and Sue are both turned to ashes when the Indigo Tribe destroys their rings.Blackest Night #3 (September 2009) In the final battle, the Flash looks around to see if Ralph and Sue were among those resurrected by the White Entity, only to be told by Green Lantern they were not coming back.Blackest Night #8 (May 2010) The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Ralph Dibny is apparently a rogue member of the Secret Six, under the alias of Damon Wells a.k.a. Big Shot, reporting to the Riddler who in this incarnation of the team serves as \\"Mockingbird.\\"Secret Six #3 (June 2015) After having reunited with his wife, Dibny makes his return as the costumed Elongated Man in Secret Six #12. Powers and abilities The Elongated Man gained his abilities by drinking a refined version of a soft drink named Gingold that contains the extract of a (fictional) fruit called gingo. It was revealed in Invasion #3 that he is a metahuman, and the Gingoid elixir interacted with his latent genes. An ordinary human would not develop such powers through ingesting the extract. In fact, most people are extremely allergic to highly concentrated Gingold. The only other hero in the DCU who uses Gingold is Stretch, a member of Hero Hotline who has been using the compound since the 1940s. As his name suggests, the Elongated Man can stretch his limbs and body to super-human lengths and sizes. These stretching powers grant the Elongated Man heightened agility enabling flexibility and coordination that is beyond the natural limits of the human body. He can contort his body into various positions and sizes impossible for ordinary humans, such as being entirely flat so that he can slip under a door, or using his fingers to pick conventional locks. He can also use it for disguise by changing the shape of his face, although this is painful and difficult for him. Ralph's physiology has greater physical limitations than Plastic Man; there is a limit to how far he can stretch his finite bodily mass, and he cannot open holes in his body as Plastic Man can. The Elongated Man's powers also greatly augment his durability. He is largely able to withstand corrosives, punctures and concussions without sustaining injury. It has been demonstrated that he is resistant to high velocities that would kill an ordinary person and that he is also more resistant to blasts from energy weapons that would kill ordinary humans. His physiology is more like that of an ordinary human than Plastic Man and, as a result, he does not share Plastic Man's nigh-invulnerability. In addition to his stretching abilities, the Elongated Man is professionally trained as a detective and is highly skilled in deductive reasoning. Often considered one of the most brilliant detectives in the DC Universe (compared with Batman only differing in the actual course of their logic). He is a talented amateur chemist as well. A meta-side effect of his powers coupled with his detective skills is enhanced olfactory sense, allowing him to \\"smell\\" when something is \\"not right\\", or if a clue or mystery is at hand. This results in a rubbery \\"nose twitch\\". Firehawk once told Ralph that the Green Arrow said the nose twitch was not a real thing but rather something he made up to get more press. The Elongated Man responded by telling her that the Green Arrow's hat covers a bald spot. Other versions Kingdom Come In Kingdom Come, when Superman comes out of retirement and re-establishes the Justice League, Batman recruits Ralph Dibny to become part of his faction. They infiltrate Lex Luthor's Mankind Liberation Front and once they discover that Luthor is brainwashing Captain Marvel, they attack and incarcerate the MLF members. The Dark Knight Strikes Again In Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Strikes Again, Dibny is mentioned as a man in a bar who was reminiscing about the Silver Age and when he heard mention of Batman, his face sagged and his jaw dropped to the floor. Later Dibny is seen hawking a \\"male enhancement\\" drink \\"Gingold\\" in a TV infomercial. He is then recruited to aid Batman in his attack against the American government (taken over by Lex Luthor). JLA/Avengers The Elongated Man appears in JLA/Avengers #3, replacing Plastic Man after the merging of the DC and Marvel Universes. Justice League Unlimited The Elongated Man has appeared in the Justice League Unlimited spin-off comic book. Countdown to Final Crisis Recently the Ralph Dibny of Earth-51, where secret identities are no longer needed by superheroes, has been seen in Countdown to Final Crisis.Countdown to Final Crisis #18 He is subsequently killed by the Monitor of New Earth, Bob.Countdown to Final Crisis #17 The Flash (2016) An evil future version of the Elongated Man called the Elongated Maniac appears in The Flash #53. He appears in Commander Cold's flashbacks to an encounter where he faces off against Commander Cold after killing hostages. In other media Television Live action Hartley Sawyer as the Elongated Man in The Flash * Ralph Dibny / the Elongated Man appears in The Flash, portrayed by Hartley Sawyer as a recurring character in Season 4 before being promoted to series regular for the fifth and sixth seasons. Though the character was recast for a single episode of Season 7https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/01/31/the-flash-season-4-episode-13-true- colors-preview/ The character was originally stated to be deceased due to Eobard Thawne's particle accelerator explosion in Season 1. However, his death was undone following the Flashpoint timeline being undone in Season 3. Ralph makes his first appearance in the fourth episode of Season 4, titled \\"Elongated Journey Into Night\\". This version was a police detective until Barry Allen discovered that he had committed perjury by planting evidence, and he was removed from the force. As a result, Ralph became a private investigator specializing in infidelity cases. He acquired his elastic powers after the Thinker manipulated Team Flash into opening a breach and exposing him to dark matter. After discovering Ralph's powers, Barry took him to S.T.A.R. Labs to stabilize him. Deciding to give Ralph a second chance after hearing he only planted the evidence because he was certain that the suspect was guilty but was unable to prove it, Barry added him to the S.T.A.R. Labs team and worked with him to help become a superhero. Ralph made his debut while substituting for Barry while he was serving time in prison, though the media saw him as a joke and initially dubbed him the \\"Stretchy Man\\" before calling him the Elongated Man due to a misunderstanding. Unlike in the comics, this version of Ralph developed the ability to morph into other people, which he used to free Barry from prison. In Season 5, Ralph began an investigation into Caitlin Snow's childhood and helped Team Flash against the serial killer the Cicada. In Season 6, Ralph was hired to find Sue Dearbon and received a badge bearing his symbol from the comics during a press conference held to recognize him as one of Central City's protectors. In the second half of the season, he found Dearbon, only to learn she was a thief. Due to this, he became inspired to reform her, which he succeeded in by the season finale.  Ralph Dibny / the Elongated Man appeared in the sixth annual Arrowverse crossover event \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", with Hartley Sawyer reprising his role. Animation The Elongated Man (left) alongside Booster Gold (right) and Skeets (background) in Justice League Unlimited * The Elongated Man makes his first television appearance in several episodes of Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Emmy-winner Jeremy Piven (Judgement Night). Although he appears in numerous episodes as a background character, he has only three episode with speaking roles. In \\"The Greatest Story Never Told\\", he is one of the members to help in the battle against Mordru, although he is put on crowd control (along with Booster Gold) to his disappointment as the Green Lantern told him that Plastic Man was already fighting Mordru and that they did not 'need two stretchy guys'. As they were on crowd control, he complains to Booster Gold about his position. This soon annoys Booster Gold, with the Elongated Man saying that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Wonder Woman then appears and says that the team needs the Elongated Man's help. He willingly follows Wonder Woman to the fight, much to Booster Gold's disappointment. Although the episode goes on to follow Booster Gold's attempt to stop a black hole, the Elongated Man (off-screen) had devised a plan to defeat Mordru and the team is shown praising him. As he is helping clean up the mess in the city, Booster Gold walks past him alongside Dr. Tracy Simmons, saying 'Squeaky wheel, buddy. Squeaky wheel'. In \\"The Ties That Bind\\", the Elongated Man and the Flash (Wally West) express concern about the fact that some other members of the Justice League do not show them enough respect. The Flash asks the Elongated Man if the Flash seems immature. The Elongated Man replies 'Not in the least' as they are shown playing Brawlin' Bots (a parody of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots). In \\"Clash\\", the Elongated Man's powers are stolen by the Parasite to use to nearly defeat Metamorpho and Batman before Captain Marvel's timely intervention. After the Parasite's defeat, the Elongated Man notices Captain Marvel blushing and says not to be modest as he thinks Superman could not have done a better job, saying 'we were just talking about [Superman]' to the Man of Steel. * The Elongated Man appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Sean Donnellan. This version possesses shape-shifting abilities. In the teaser of the episode \\"Journey to the Center of the Bat\\", he works with Plastic Man and Batman to stop Baby Face, using his shape-shifting abilities to pass himself off as Baby Face to fool Baby Face's henchmen. The two ductile metahumans constantly bicker on who is the better partner to Batman. Batman later gives the truth: the Dark Knight prefers to work alone between them. The Elongated Man is also shown in an image with Batman in the episode \\"Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases\\" along with Detective Chimp, the Question and the Martian Manhunter. Additionally, the Elongated Man appears in a non- speaking cameo in the two-part episode \\"The Siege of Starro!\\", first appearing alongside the heroes possessed by Starro and later among the heroes that have already broken free of Starro's mind control. * The Elongated Man appears in Mad, voiced by Ralph Garman. He joins the other superheroes in a musical number that asks Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \\"Super Friends\\". In his part, the Elongated Man stated that he was strapped for cash and asking Superman for money seems to be kryptonite. * The Elongated Man appeared in Young Justice: Outsiders, voiced by David Kaye. In the episode, \\"Terminus\\", he appears as part of a League raid on Granny Goodness's orphanage until he is subjected to the Anti-Life Equation. Film * An evil version of the Elongated Man called the Extruded Man appears as a member of the Crime Syndicate of America in the animated film Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths as one of the Owlman's men (originally one of the henchmen of the parallel Earth Martian Manhunter) who face the Justice League. He was caught by the Flash, who runs around the place to tie him up on pillars and building structures. Then the Flash teases him with a flick of his elongated body with a rubber sound. * In the animated film Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, the Elongated Man is mentioned to have been murdered in the Flashpoint universe and was known as the Elongated Kid. * The Elongated Man was mentioned in Batman and Harley Quinn. * The Elongated Man makes a brief appearance in Teen Titans Go!

Septentrional, meaning \\"of the north\\", is a Latinate adjective sometimes used in English. It is a form of the Latin noun septentriones, which refers to the seven stars of the Big Dipper, occasionally called the Septentrion. In the 18th century, septentrional languages was a recognised term for the Germanic languages. Etymology and background The Oxford English Dictionary gives the etymology of septentrional as: \\"Septentrional\\" is more or less synonymous with the term \\"boreal\\", derived from Boreas, a Greek god of the North Wind. The constellation Ursa Major, containing the Big Dipper, or Plough, dominates the skies of the North. The usual antonym for septentrional is the term meridional, which refers to the noonday sun. Usage The term septentrional is found on maps, mostly those made before 1700. Early maps of North America often refer to the northern- and northwesternmost unexplored areas of the continent as at the \\"Septentrional\\" and as \\"America Septentrionalis\\", sometimes with slightly varying spellings.For example, the \\"Double Hemisphere\\" world map, by Moses Pitt, dated about 1680, by labels North America as America Septentriona, to identify the uncharted, northwest of North America.

Many clock towers are freestanding structures but they can also adjoin or be located on top of another building. Some other buildings also have clock faces on their exterior but these structures serve other main functions. Clock towers are a common sight in many parts of the world with some being iconic buildings. One example is the Elizabeth Tower in London (usually called \\"Big Ben\\", although strictly this name belongs only to the bell inside the tower). Definition There are many structures which may have clocks or clock faces attached to them and some structures have had clocks added to an existing structure. According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat a building is defined as a building if at least fifty percent of its height is made up of floor plates containing habitable floor area. Structures that do not meet this criterion, are defined as towers. A clock tower historically fits this definition of a tower and therefore can be defined as any tower specifically built with one or more (often four) clock faces and that can be either freestanding or part of a church or municipal building such as a town hall. Not all clocks on buildings therefore make the building into a clock tower. The mechanism inside the tower is known as a turret clock. It often marks the hour (and sometimes segments of an hour) by sounding large bells or chimes, sometimes playing simple musical phrases or tunes. Some clock towers were previously built as Bell towers and then had clocks added to them. As these structures fulfil the definition of a tower they can be considered to be clock towers. History Presumably the first depiction of a medieval central European clock tower (without the actual turret clock) in the 13th century by Villard de Honnecourt, entitled: \\"cest li masons don orologe\\" (\\"this is the house of a clock\\") Although clock towers are today mostly admired for their aesthetics, they once served an important purpose. Before the middle of the twentieth century, most people did not have watches, and prior to the 18th century even home clocks were rare. The first clocks did not have faces, but were solely striking clocks, which sounded bells to call the surrounding community to work or to prayer. They were therefore placed in towers so the bells would be audible for a long distance. Clock towers were placed near the centres of towns and were often the tallest structures there. As clock towers became more common, the designers realized that a dial on the outside of the tower would allow the townspeople to read the time whenever they wanted. The Tower of the Winds in Athens, built circa 50 BC during Roman Greece The use of clock towers dates back to the antiquity. The earliest clock tower was the Tower of the Winds in Athens which featured eight sundials. In its interior, there was also a water clock (or clepsydra), driven by water coming down from the Acropolis.Joseph V. Noble; Derek J. de Solla Price: The Water Clock in the Tower of the Winds, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (1968), pp. 345-355 (353) In Song China, an astronomical clock tower was designed by Su Song and erected at Kaifeng in 1088, featuring a liquid escapement mechanism. In England, a clock was put up in a clock tower, the medieval precursor to Big Ben, at Westminster, in 1288;Clocks, Encyclopædia Britannica 5, 835 (1951).Frederick Tupper, Jr., 'Anglo-Saxon Dæg-Mæl', Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, Vol. 10, No. 2 (1895), p. 130, citing Archæologia, v, 416. and in 1292 a clock was put up in Canterbury Cathedral. The oldest surviving turret clock formerly part of a clock tower in Europe is the Salisbury Cathedral clock, completed in 1306; and another clock put up at St. Albans, in 1326, 'showed various astronomical phenomena'. Al-Jazari constructed an elaborate clock and described it in his Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices in 1206. It was about high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar paths, and a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour.Howard R. Turner (1997), Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction, p. 184. University of Texas Press, .Donald Routledge Hill, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, p. 64-69. (cf. Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering ) It was possible to re-program the length of day and night daily in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year, and it also featured five robotic musicians who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel. Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float, a float chamber and flow regulator, plate and valve trough, two pulleys, crescent disc displaying the zodiac, and two falcon automata dropping balls into vases. Al-Jazari's castle clock is considered to be the earliest programmable analog computer. Line (mains) synchronous tower clocks were introduced in the United States in the 1920s. Landmarks Elizabeth Tower at the north end (right) of the Palace of Westminster Some clock towers have become famous landmarks. Prominent examples include Elizabeth Tower built in 1859, which houses the Great Bell (generally known as Big Ben) in London, the tower of Philadelphia City Hall, the Rajabai Tower in Mumbai, the Spasskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin, the Torre dell'Orologio in the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy, and the Zytglogge clock tower in the Old City of Bern, Switzerland.

Developed from a base of spotted horses with Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred bloodlines, the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) breed registry is now one of the largest in North America. The registry allows some non-spotted animals to be registered as \\"Solid Paint Bred\\" and considers the American Paint Horse to be a horse breed with distinct characteristics, not merely a color breed. Registration The American Paint Horse's combination of color and conformation has made the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) the second-largest breed registry in the United States.American Paint Horse Association While the colorful coat pattern is essential to the identity of the breed, American Paint Horses have strict bloodline requirements and a distinctive stock-horse body type. To be eligible for registry, a Paint's sire and dam must be registered with the American Paint Horse Association, the American Quarter Horse Association, or the Jockey Club (Thoroughbreds). At least one of the parents must be a registered American Paint Horse. There are two categories of registration, regular, for horses with color, and solid Paint-bred, for those without color. Regular APHA registration A regular registry Paint In addition to bloodlines, to be eligible for the Regular Registry of the American Paint Horse Association (APHA), the horse must also exhibit a \\"natural paint marking\\", meaning either a predominant hair coat color with at least one contrasting area of solid white hair of the required size with some underlying unpigmented skin present on the horse at the time of its birth. Or, in the case of a predominantly white hair coat, at least one contrasting area of the required size of colored hair with some underlying pigmented skin present on the horse. Natural Paint markings usually must cover more than two inches and be located in certain designated areas of the body. APHA Color Requirements Solid Paint-Bred  Solid Paint-bred foal. Sire was a sorrel and white tobiano, dam is a black and white tovero. Foal is a solid Chestnut. Solid colored offspring of two registered Paint parents, called \\"Solid Paint-Breds\\" or \\"Breeding Stock Paints,\\" are also eligible for registration, with certain restrictions. They are able to participate in some recognized Paint breed shows, and there are alternative programs offered, and many incentive programs within the registry are available to Solid Paint-bred horses. If a solid-colored horse is bred to a regular registry Paint horse, it is possible to produce a spotted foal. In some cases, such as the recessive sabino patterns, described below, even a solid colored horse may still carry genes for color. However, in the case of the dominant tobiano pattern, a Breeding Stock Paint will not carry these color genes, though it may retain other desirable traits. Color A tobiano Paint Each Paint Horse has a particular combination of white and another color of the equine spectrum. Most common are horses with white spots combined with black, bay, brown, and chestnut or sorrel. Less common are horses with spot colors influenced by dilution genes such as palomino, buckskin, cremello, perlino, pearl or \\"Barlink factor\\", and champagne, Stamatelakys, Irene (October 2008). \\"True Champagne.\\" Paint Horse Journal. various shades of roan, or various shades of dun, including grullo.APHA coat colors. Paints may also carry the gray gene and have spots that eventually fade to white hair, though retaining pigmented skin underneath the areas that were once dark. Spots can be any shape or size, except leopard complex patterning, which is characteristic of the Appaloosa, and located virtually anywhere on the Paint's body. Although Paints come in a variety of colors with different markings and different underlying genetics, these are grouped into only four defined coat patterns: overo (includes frame, splash and sabino), tobiano and tovero and solid. Breeding Stock Paints can sometimes showcase small color traits, particularly if they carry sabino genetics. Such traits include blue eyes, pink skin on lips and nostrils, roan spots, and minimal roaning. Terms for color patterns defined An Overo Paint *Tobiano: The most common spotting pattern, characterized by rounded markings with white legs and white across the back between the withers and the dock of the tail, usually arranged in a roughly vertical pattern and more white than dark, with the head usually dark and with markings like that of a normal horse. i.e. star, snip, strip, or blaze. *Overo: A group of spotting patterns characterized by sharp, irregular markings with a horizontal orientation, usually more dark than white, though the face is usually white, sometimes with blue eyes. The white rarely crosses the back, and the lower legs are normally dark. The APHA recognizes three overo patterns: Frame: The most familiar overo pattern, the gene for frame has been genetically mapped and in the homozygous form, results in Lethal White Syndrome (LWS). Visually identified frames have no health defects connected to their color, and are characterized by ragged, sharp white patches on the sides of the body, leaving a \\"frame\\" of non-white color that typically includes the topline. Sabino: Often confused with roan or rabicano, sabino is a slight spotting pattern characterized by high white on legs, belly spots, white markings on the face extending past the eyes and/or patches of roaning patterns standing alone or on the edges of white markings. Splashed white: The least common spotting pattern, splashed whites typically have blue eyes and crisp, smooth, blocky white markings that almost always include the head and legs. The tail is often white or white-tipped, and body markings originate under the belly and extend \\"upwards\\". *Tovero: spotting pattern that is a mix of tobiano and overo coloration, such as blue eyes on a dark head. *Solid: A horse otherwise eligible for registration as a Paint that does not have any white that constitutes a recognized spotting pattern. *\\"Color\\": An informal term meaning that the horse has a spotting pattern. (The opposite of \\"Solid.\\") *\\"Chrome\\": An informal term of approval used in some geographic regions to describe a particularly flashy spotting pattern. *Pintaloosa: An informal term used to describe the color of a horse that has been crossbred between an American Paint and an Appaloosa. Paint or Pinto? The terms \\"paint\\" and \\"pinto\\" are sometimes both used to describe paint horses. But \\"Paint\\" horses are the breed and \\"Pinto\\" is actually the coloring of the horse History The American Paint Horse shares a common ancestry with the American Quarter Horse and the Thoroughbred. A registered Paint horse should conform to the same \\"stock horse\\" body type desired in Quarter Horses: a muscular animal that is heavy but not too tall, with a low center of gravity for maneuverability, and powerful hindquarters suitable for rapid acceleration and sprinting. When the American Quarter Horse Association emerged in 1940 to preserve horses of the \\"stock\\" type, it excluded those with pinto coat patterns and \\"crop out\\" horses, those born with white body spots or white above the knees and hocks. Undeterred, fans of colorful stock horses formed a variety of organizations to preserve and promote Paint horses. In 1965 some of these groups merged to form the American Paint Horse Association. Uses An overo Paint Horse exhibited in a Western riding discipline. The Paint Horse is used in a variety of equestrian disciplines, most commonly Western pleasure, reining and other Western events, although it is also ridden English in hunt seat or show jumping competition. Genetic problems One medical issue associated with the breed is the genetic disease lethal white syndrome (LWS). Also called Overo lethal white syndrome (OLWS) or, less often, white foal syndrome (WFS), it is linked to a recessive gene associated with the frame overo pattern. Horses that are heterozygous carriers of the gene do not develop the condition and are physically healthy. However, when a foal is born that is homozygous for the LWS gene, it should be humanely euthanized shortly after birth, or else will die within a few days from complications involving an underdeveloped intestinal tract. A DNA test is available for LWS so that horses who are carriers of this gene are not bred to one another. Horses can carry the LWS gene and not visibly exhibit overo coloring; cases have appeared in the offspring of both tobiano and solid-colored parents, though all cases to date are horses that had overo ancestors. LWS is also not unique to Paint Horses; it can occur in any equine breed where the frame overo coat pattern is found. Due to the heavy influx of American Quarter Horse breeding, some Paints may also carry genetic disorders such as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA), equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (called PSSM - polysaccharide storage myopathy - in Paints, Quarter Horses and Appaloosas), malignant hyperthermia (MH) and glycogen branching enzyme deficiency (GBED). The influence of Thoroughbred breeding puts some bloodlines at higher risk for Wobbler's syndrome. References *Paul D. Vrotsos RVT and Elizabeth M. Santschi DVM.

Nichols, Historic New Rochelle New Rochelle, New York: Board of Education, 1938. He was one of the first backers of an American transcontinental railway. A trip to China in 1842-44 impressed upon Whitney the need for a transcontinental railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific. When Whitney returned to the United States in 1844, he realized the benefits from such an undertaking, and spent a great deal of money trying to get the Congress to take up the project. In 1849, he published A Project for a Railroad to the Pacific. For years he continued to write revised memorials and take expeditions through what was then known as Indian Territory to support his cause. Later Whitney's dream was realized through the efforts of Theodore Judah. In the end, Whitney lived to see his dream realized in 1869 with the opening of the Union Pacific.Seymour Dunbar, A History of Travel in America.  Early life  Asa Whitney was born on March 14, 1797 in North Groton, Connecticut. His parents were Sarah Mitchell and Shubael Whitney. He is distantly related to Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin. They were fifth cousins. For five generations, the Whitney family had been farmers. However, from a young age, Asa Whitney showed no interest in agriculture and wanted to be a merchant.  Career  He went to New York in his late teens to chase his dream of being a merchant. He began as a clerk, working for a huge importer of French goods. He was promoted, and, by 1832, he was a successful dry-goods merchant.  Marriage  While he was abroad in France in 1832, he married a French girl, Herminie Antoinette Pillet. However, just a mere year after they met, she died on March 31, 1833. She was buried in New Rochelle, very close to where Asa had planned to start a family with her. He mourned for a short time, and even kept a lock of her hair after she had died. However, he did not mourn for long. He married again to Sarah Jay Munro. She died on November 12, 1840. This may have been a miscarriage or an unsuccessful childbirth. She was buried next to Asa’s first wife. In 1852, Whitney married Mrs. Catherine (Moore) Campbell of Wilmington, N.C. She outlived her husband by six years and is buried beside him in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington, D.C.Margaret L. Brown, \\"Asa Whitney and His Pacific Railroad Publicity Campaign,\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review, Vol. 20, No. 2 (Sept. 1933), p. 223.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/38919770/asa- whitney  Trip to China  After his wife died, his property in New York faced foreclosure and was put up for auction. Whitney was only given $10,000 for his property. He sold the rest of his land and drew his interests toward China. On June 18, 1842, he set sail to China on his ship, the Oscar. The Oscar was loaded down with a lot of goods which resulted in the ship moving very slowly. The voyage to China usually took around 100 days, and newer ships could make the trip in as short as 79 days. However, Whitney’s trip took 153 days, a record slowness for the year. Whitney became very angry during this trip and he was apt to having rages and temper tantrums. He arrived in China during the Opium Wars, which was a dispute between the British and the Chinese. After the dispute died down, many other nations began to trade with China, and Whitney became one of a few Americans who helped with the exportation of teas, spices, and other goods. His profits began piling up. By the time he left China, he had enough money to retire. His time in China lasted a year and four months, and he headed back home on April 2, 1844. His trip back was also very long and tedious.  Attempts at a Transcontinental Railroad  On the way back from China, Asa Whitney began devising a plan that would make the trip to China much easier. He wanted to build a railroad across the United States. People on the East coast could take the train to the West coast, and then take a ship from there to China. It would greatly shorten the long trip. When he arrived back in the United States, he was full of inspiration and drive and he got straight to work. He bought property in upstate New York and began working on a memorial to Congress about his plan for a railroad. His plan was mainly focused on trade with China, and connecting the two countries for increased culture, immigration, and commerce. He believed that the railroad would open trade to all of Asia, and unite the continents. He spent a great amount of time and money to try to promote his plan, and he explored a lot of the routes that he considered. He wrote A Project for a Railroad to the Pacific, a memorial to the United States Congress, in 1849. His plan was detailed and impressive, but he was denied. He continued trying to create the railroad, taking surveys and examining potential routes. He wanted to create a route that went way up north to the Puget Sound. However, no matter how hard he tried, his plan was never accepted, and he stopped campaigning in 1851.  Death  Asa Whitney lived long enough to see his dream become a reality; he was alive when the first transcontinental railroad was completed. He died in 1872, three years after the golden spike was laid, of typhoid fever.Alexandria (VA) Gazette, 18 Sept. 1872, p. 2  Legacy  Although Whitney’s plan fell through, word began spreading of the idea of a transcontinental railroad. His plan inspired many young, ambitious engineers, one of which being Theodore Judah, a man who helped make the dream of a transcontinental railroad into a reality.

Biography Early career J. M. DeMatteis's earliest aspirations were to be a rock musician and comic book artist. He began playing in bands starting in the sixth grade, generally in the role of lead singer, songwriter and rhythm guitarist, and also wrote music reviews for a number of publications. He began drawing at a young age, and was accepted into the School of the Visual Arts. DeMatteis recalled, \\"...for some reason, I think it was financial, I ended up not going. Somewhere after that what little drawing skills I had began to atrophy.\\" He graduated from Midwood High School in Brooklyn in 1971. DeMatteis's is Jewish.J.M. DeMatteis's CREATION POINT: PLEASE STAND BY www.jmdematteis.com › 2014/01 › please-stand- by Posted by J.M. DeMatteis at 8:25 PM ... Forget grandmothers, Jack, I had a Jewish MOTHER who was always doing that! ... American writers are fascinating. DeMatteis then turned from drawing to writing. He got his start in comic books at DC Comics in the late 1970s. After a number of rejected submissions, his first accepted story was \\"The Lady-Killer Craves Blood\\", but it would not be published until years later in House of Mystery #282 (July 1980). His first published story for the company was \\"The Blood Boat!\\" in Weird War Tales #70 (Dec. 1978). He contributed to the company's line of horror comics notably with the creation of the Creature Commandos in Weird War Tales #93 (Nov. 1980) and I…Vampire in House of Mystery #290 (March 1981).Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 193 \\"Writer J. M. DeMatteis unveiled vampire/vampire hunter Andrew Bennett with the help of artist Tom Sutton in The House of Mystery #290.\\" He briefly wrote the Aquaman feature in Adventure Comics as well.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 187: \\"With issue #475, fan favorite Aquaman was added to the [Adventure Comics] lineup, and his first installment was written by J. M. DeMatteis and illustrated by Dick Giordano.\\" DeMatteis and artist Brian Bolland produced a backup story titled \\"Falling Down to Heaven\\" in Madame Xanadu, DC's first attempt at marketing comics specifically to the \\"direct market\\" of fans and collectors. DeMatteis had long been eager to work for Marvel Comics, and following roughly a year in which editor-in-chief Jim Shooter kept him busy with odd jobs and fill-ins, in 1980 he was made the lead writer for Marvel on The Defenders, and had lengthy runs on Captain America, paired with penciler Mike Zeck, and Marvel Team-Up. 1980s After writing a negative review of the Grateful Dead's 1980 album Go to Heaven which was published in Rolling Stone, DeMatteis ended his career as a music critic. He explained, \\"Grateful Dead fans are like hardcore comic book fans, you know... and I know that when I sit down to write a review that I'm just some shmuck sitting down at a typewriter with an opinion—but then it's in print in something like Rolling Stone. I got all these letters, which I saved, from all these hardcore Grateful Dead fans—wounded. ... I said if I'm gonna review at all I'm not gonna write negative reviews anymore...\\" Around this time he also surrendered his professional career as a rock musician, after years of playing in New York City-based bands. In 1984, DeMatteis and artist Bob Budiansky produced a Prince Namor limited series. He saw the series as an opportunity to both delve more into the psychology of the title character than he had been able to in The Defenders and to continue his collaboration with Budiansky from the recently canceled Ghost Rider, later recalling, \\"We'd get on the phone, start talking, and the stories would come so easily. We had a fantastic rapport, personally and professionally.\\" DeMatteis had mixed feelings about the series itself, and said the one part of which he was unreservedly proud was the look into Namor's years as an amnesiac homeless man. DeMatteis and illustrator Jon J. Muth created the graphic novel Moonshadow, for Marvel's Epic line: the groundbreaking story was the first fully painted series in American comics. DeMatteis followed this with the 1986 Doctor Strange graphic novel Into Shamballa drawn by Dan Green and Blood: A Tale, a hallucinatory vampire story drawn by Kent Williams. In 1987, DeMatteis and Zeck re-teamed for the \\"Kraven's Last Hunt\\" arc that ran throughout Marvel's then three Spider-Man titles. The arc has been collected in multiple editions and remains one of the most popular, and respected, stories in Spider-Man's history.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 231: \\"The six-issue story arc...ran through all the Spider-Man titles for two months.\\" Moving back to DC, DeMatteis succeeded Gerry Conway as writer of the superhero-team title Justice League of America. He used the pen name Michael Ellis on his first issue of the series. When that title was cancelledManning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 226: \\"Alongside artist Luke McDonnell, DeMatteis crafted a dramatic four-part finale to the first series of DC's premier team of superheroes.\\" in the wake of the company-wide crossover Legends, DeMatteis stayed through its relaunch as Justice League International,Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 228: \\"It was clear that the [Justice League] needed a major overhaul. But no one quite expected how drastic the transformation would truly be in the hands of writers Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis and artist Kevin Maguire.\\" scripting over the plots of Keith Giffen. JLI took such lesser-known DC characters as Martian Manhunter, Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Mister Miracle, Captain Atom, and Power Girl and turned the then-current preoccupation with \\"grim 'n' gritty\\" superheroes on its head. The lighthearted series emphasized the absurd aspects of people with strange powers, wearing colorful costumes, volunteering to fight evildoers. Although the League had its serious side and often faced world-threatening villains, the stories included such characters as the lovably inept G'nort, the worst Green Lantern in the Green Lantern Corps, Mr. Nebula, the interplanetary decorator, the Injustice League, a bunch of bumbling losers and a flock of homicidal penguins who had been hybridized with piranhas. The success of Justice League International led to a spin-off in 1989 titled Justice League Europe also co-written with Giffen and featuring art by Bart Sears.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 239: \\"Spinning out of the pages of Justice League International, an offshoot of the Justice League set up camp in Paris. Written by Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis with art by Bart Sears.\\" 1990s The Giffen/DeMatteis team worked on Justice League for five years and closed out their run with the \\"Breakdowns\\" storyline in 1991 and 1992.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 251: \\"The lauded Giffen/DeMatteis era of the Justice League came to a dramatic close with \\"Breakdowns\\", a sixteen-part storyline that crossed through the pages of both Justice League America and Justice League Europe.\\" DeMatteis scripted Justice League spin-offs such as solo series for Mister Miracle and Doctor Fate. Back at Marvel, DeMatteis again succeeded Conway, this time as writer of The Spectacular Spider-Man in 1991, taking the series in a grimmer, more psychologically oriented direction. In collaboration with regular artist Sal Buscema, DeMatteis' story arc \\"The Child Within\\" (#178–184) featured the return of the Harry Osborn Green Goblin.Cowsill, Alan \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 193: Starting this issue [#178] was 'The Child Within' story arc, another classic tale from writer J. M. DeMatteis exploring the psychology of Spidey, Vermin, and the Green Goblin. Spider-Man's battle with the Goblin continued in \\"The Osborn Legacy\\" in #189Cowsill \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 198: \\"Writer J. M. DeMatteis and artist Sal Buscema spun a tale in which Harry Osborne again succumbed to the madness of his Green Goblin identity and launched an all-out attack on Spidey.\\" and came to an end when Harry died in \\"The Best Of Enemies!\\" (#200).Cowsill \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 203: \\"This giant-size issue by writer J. M. DeMatteis and artist Sal Buscema brought Spidey's relationship with the Green Goblin to a dramatic conclusion.\\" In 1994, DeMatteis took over from David Michelinie as writer of The Amazing Spider-Man #389–406 for a run that included the apparent death of Peter Parker's Aunt MayCowsill \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 218: \\"May's death was temporary; November 1998's The Spectacular Spider-Man #263 revealed that the woman who died was a genetically modified actress.\\" and the beginnings of the \\"Clone Saga\\" arc. DeMatteis as well worked on such characters as Doctor Strange, Daredevil, Man-Thing, and the Silver Surfer. DeMatteis helped launch DC's mature-audience Vertigo imprint, writing the graphic novels Mercy and Farewell, Moonshadow (a sequel to the Epic Comics series), the miniseries The Last One, and the 15-issue series Seekers Into The Mystery, the story of a Hollywood screenwriter on a journey of self-discovery and the search for universal truths. DeMatteis wrote an autobiographical, digest-sized miniseries Brooklyn Dreams, published by DC's Paradox Press imprint. DeMatteis' most personal work, it was later collected in one volume under the Vertigo imprint. 21st century In the 2000s, DeMatteis redefined the Spectre, through the character of Hal Jordan, as a spirit of redemption rather than of vengeance. DeMatteis co-scripted the \\"Gods of Gotham\\" storyline in Wonder Woman #164–166 (January to March 2001) with Phil Jimenez.Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 298 \\"The 'Gods of Gotham' storyline marked the start of Phil Jimenez's run on the series as artist and writer (with J. M. DeMatteis on board as co-scripter for the first arc).\\" In 2003, with Giffen, he revived the Justice League International for the mini- series Formerly Known as the Justice League.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 311: \\"In 2003, writers J. M. DeMatteis and Keith Giffen and original artist Kevin Maguire worked on a six-part series reuniting [their version of] the team.\\" The series won Giffen, DeMatteis and artist Kevin Maguire an Eisner Award. The team followed this with \\"I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League\\" arc in JLA Classified and, at Marvel, a five-issue run of The Defenders. In 2006, DeMatteis and Giffen began work on two original superhero comedy series, Hero Squared and Planetary Brigade for Boom! Studios. DeMatteis teamed with veteran artist Mike Ploog to create the CrossGen fantasy comic Abadazad (May 2004). The following year, Ploog and DeMatteis announced they were collaborating on a five-issue miniseries, Stardust Kid, from the Image Comics imprint Desperado Publishing. The series moved to Boom! Studios in 2006. The Walt Disney Company acquired Abadazad for its Hyperion Books for Children imprint. The first two books in the series—Abadazad: The Road to Inconceivable and Abadazad: The Dream Thief—were released June 2006. The third book—Abadazad: The Puppet, The Professor and The Prophet—was released in the United Kingdom in 2007. In June 2010, DeMatteis's children's fantasy novel, Imaginalis, was published by Katherine Tegen Books, an imprint of HarperCollins. In 2008, DeMatteis became editor-in-chief of Ardden Entertainment, guiding the launch of a new Flash Gordon comic book series. In 2009, he wrote a five-issue comic book limited series, illustrated by Mike Cavallaro, The Life and Times of Savior 28, which was released by IDW Publishing in 2009. He also wrote the Metal Men back-up story in the new Doom Patrol and returned to Marvel Comics for a number of new Spider-Man stories. In 2010, DeMatteis reunited once again with frequent collaborator Keith Giffen for a run on the comic book series Booster Gold. The two teamed on the DC Retroactive: JLA – The '90s one-shot in October 2011. Also in 2011, DeMatteis created the all-ages fantasy The Adventures of Augusta Wind for IDW Publishing. In 2013, he took over DC Comics' Phantom Stranger and launched the 12-issue Larfleeze series with Giffen. DeMatteis became the writer of Justice League Dark in October 2013 and, again with Giffen, launched Justice League 3000 in December. In 2015, DeMatteis teamed with animation legend Bruce Timm for Justice League: Gods and Monsters, a comic book prequel to the successful animated film. In 2016, Giffen and DeMatteis launched Scooby Apocalypse for DC—a more adult reimagining of the classic cartoon—and IDW published DeMatteis's Augusta Wind sequel The Adventures of Augusta Wind: The Last Story. 2018 saw the release of the IDW series Impossible, Incorporated, with another new creator-owned series, The Girl in the Bay, from Berger Books, announced for 2019. Other media DeMatteis has also written for television, having scripted episodes of the 1980s incarnation of The Twilight Zone, the syndicated series The Adventures of Superboy and Earth: Final Conflict, as well as for the animated series The Real Ghostbusters, Justice League Unlimited, Legion of Super Heroes, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien, Sym-Bionic Titan, ThunderCats, Teen Titans Go! and Marvel's Spider-Man. DeMatteis also wrote the 2015 animated DTV movie Batman vs. Robin and its 2016 sequel, Batman: Bad Blood. The same year, DeMatteis wrote multiple episodes of Cartoon Network's Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!. In 2017, DeMatteis co-wrote the DTV movie Justice League Dark and, in 2018, he wrote all episodes of the CW Seed spin-off animated series Constantine: City of Demons and the expanded, DTV movie Constantine: City of Demons – The Movie. Also a musician, DeMatteis released one album in the late 1990s, How Many Lifetimes?.

After an early career in literary and music criticism (during the late 1970s, he wrote for the now-defunct magazine Records and Recording), Norris moved in 1991 to the Cardiff Philosophy Department. In 1997, he was awarded the title of Distinguished Research Professor in the Cardiff School of English, Communication & Philosophy. He has also held fellowships and visiting appointments at a number of institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley, the City University of New York, Aarhus University, and Dartmouth College. He is one of the world's leading scholars on deconstruction, and the work of Jacques Derrida. He has written numerous books and papers on literary theory, continental philosophy, philosophy of music, philosophy of language and philosophy of science. More recently, he has been focussing on the work of Alain Badiou in relation with both the analytic tradition (particularly analytic philosophy of mathematics) and with the philosophy of Derrida.

It is notable for its exceptionally bad time complexity of . The running time of the algorithm is thus slower compared to reasonable sorting algorithms, and is slower than Bubble sort, a canonical example of a fairly inefficient sort. It is however more efficient than Slowsort. The name comes from The Three Stooges. The algorithm is defined as follows: * If the value at the start is larger than the value at the end, swap them. * If there are 3 or more elements in the list, then:  Stooge sort the initial 2/3 of the list  Stooge sort the final 2/3 of the list  Stooge sort the initial 2/3 of the list again It is important to get the integer sort size used in the recursive calls by rounding the 2/3 upwards, e.g. rounding 2/3 of 5 should give 4 rather than 3, as otherwise the sort can fail on certain data.

From this point of view, someone who is not fully hearing has a hearing loss or is said to be hard of hearing or deaf. The continuum of hearing ability tends to be broken down into fine gradations. Moving down the scale and further away from the medical norm, people are classed as hearing, then slightly hard of hearing, moderately hard of hearing, severely hard of hearing, and finally deaf (severely deaf or profoundly deaf for those furthest from the norm). However, when examined in the context of Deaf culture, the term “hearing” often does not hold the same meaning as when one thinks simply of a person's ability to hear sounds. In Deaf culture, “hearing”, being the opposite of “Deaf” (which is used inclusively, without the many gradations common to mainstream culture), is often used as a way of differentiating those who do not view the Deaf community as a linguistic minority, do not embrace Deaf values, history, language, mores, and sense of personal dignity as Deaf people do themselves. Among language minorities in the United States - for example, groups such as Mexicans, Koreans, Italians, Chinese, or Deaf users of sign language - the minority language group itself has a “we” or “insider” view of their cultural group as well as a “they” or “outsider” view of those who do not share the values of the group. So, in addition to using “hearing” to identify a person who can detect sounds, Deaf culture uses this term as a we and they distinction to show a difference in attitude between people who embrace the view of deaf people who use sign language as a language minority, and those who view deafness strictly from its pathological context. This being the case, a single person could be described as hearing by one person and Deaf by another because the first person was thinking simply about the subject's sensitivity to sound whereas the other person was thinking, partially about the persons ability to rely on residual hearing, but also about their personal views, their identity, or perhaps their ignorance of cultural norms.

It was written by David Anez, who at the time was a physics instructor living in the American Midwest. The comic first appeared on April 1, 2000 and ran until July 28, 2007. It was updated daily, with there being only 29 days without a comic in its seven years of production and with 2568 comics being made altogether. Most Bob and George strips are still images. The initial strips were mostly done in GIF format (occasionally using JPEG for more graphic-intensive comics) before converting to PNG in May 2004. In addition, occasional comics are animated using either animated GIFs or Macromedia Flash. Some of the Flash comics have the characters speaking, voiced by Anez and others (often forum members). Animated comics are generally used for the annual week-long anniversary parties (usually culminating in a brief animated comic that recaps the events of the past year in a matter of seconds), for especially climactic scenes, and for a series of videos depicting an in-comic event known as \\"the Cataclysm\\". The comic's plot is mostly made up of story arcs of varying lengths. Amongst past story arcs there have been retellings of various Mega Man games (which often play out quite differently from the originals), as well as battles against powerful foes. In addition, many of the story arcs involve either time travel, dimensional travel, and villains who want to kill all the characters. History An early hand-drawn comic from June 7, 2000 Bob and George was originally planned to be a hand-drawn webcomic about the college adventures of the two titular brothers. Slated to start on April 1, 2000, the plan fell through because Anez did not have a scanner with which to scan his drawings. He stated \\"I was hoping to use my friend's scanner, but he was never around.\\" He instead released a sequence of filler comics using Mega Man sprites, which he intended to be a temporary measure until he gained access to a scanner, at which point he would implement his initial plan involving the hand drawn comics. He eventually purchased a scanner, and on June 1 he released the hand-drawn comic. The hand-drawn comic was to revolve around a group of superheroes attending college. Neither the initial attempt nor a later attempt at it went well, and both times he returned to the Mega Man sprite comic. Anez has stated that he hated the hand-drawn comic. The hand-drawn comic made something of a return in the storyline \\"All Good Things\\"—the hand-drawn format is used to represent George's home dimension, though this time drawn by Liss, Dave's wife. Dave stated the reason for this is he realized that he still could not draw, and was not going to get any better. However, this meant that the comic strip was titled \\"Bob and George\\", but did not contain any characters named \\"Bob\\" or \\"George\\". This was fixed with the introduction of sprite versions of the two characters into the comic. Bob is depicted as a gray Proto Man recolor while George is a Mega Man recolor with blond hair and no helmet. David planned to end the comic by April 1, 2007, which is the end of the seventh year of the comic's run. However, the story took longer than expected, and the comic ended on Anez's birthday, July 28, 2007. There were a total of 2,658 daily comics produced. Significance While not the first webcomic to ever use video game sprites in place of hand-drawn art, Bob and George is noted as being the first sprite comic to gain widespread popularity and the originator of the sprite comic \\"craze\\".Campbell, T.

Clevinger has called Anez \\"the Father of Sprite Comics\\" for his role in popularizing the phenomenon, and directly credits a friend showing him Anez's Bob and George for his inspiration to make his comic. Regarding the use of sprites in a comic, Clevinger has said, Cast 500px Bob and George has a large cast of characters consisting of characters from the Mega Man series of games, as well as original characters created by Anez and others. *Mega Man – the robotic protagonist of the original Mega Man video game series. *The Author – the (nearly) all-powerful being who creates the comic. He appears as a blue/purple palette swap of Mega Man without his helmet. Alternate versions of The Author, such as \\"The Shadowy Author\\", appear in Bob and George as villains. *Bob – the younger, evil, and more mature brother of George. His alter-ego is Napalm, a super-powered being with control over fire. He is very adept at programming. He is a grey palette swap of Proto Man, with red hair underneath his helmet. His abilities in combat and his intelligence surpass most of the other characters, to the point he's referred to himself as a Mary Sue. *George – heroic where his younger brother Bob is villainous. His alter-ego is Blitz, a super hero with control over lightning. George is a light blue and grey palette swap of helmet-less Mega Man with flat, blonde hair. Other characters featured in Bob and George include Proto Man, Dr. Light, Roll, and Bass. Mega Man characters such as Dr. Wily, X, and Zero are featured in Bob and George as villains and adversaries. Storyline The plot of Bob and George involves various re-tellings of the plot from the Mega Man video games, interspersed with the characters interacting and sometimes battling villains of Anez's own creation. Time travel and inter-dimensional travel are common occurrences, with many of the characters hailing from dimensions (or times) other than that of the main continuity. This leads to a number of temporal paradoxes. Story lines frequently involve breaking the fourth wall, with the strips' Author being a regular character. A running theme of the comic is that most, if not all, of the characters are fully aware that they are in a webcomic.

The New Guard is known for its agitation against Premier of New South Wales Jack Lang. It was founded and led by Eric Campbell, a World War I veteran and former Old Guard member. At its peak, membership was estimated to be around 50,000. The organisation attracted great publicity when member Captain Francis de Groot, on horseback and at Campbell's direction, upstaged Lang in cutting the ribbon at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in protest at the latter's anti- monarchist ideology. After Lang’s dismissal in May 1932 the New Guard’s membership declined rapidly. During this time Campbell had met with fascists and National Socialists such as Sir Oswald Mosley and Joachim von Ribbentrop, and in 1934 published his manifesto The New Road, signalling the New Guard’s ideological transition as Campbell argued his case for an Australian application of Italian corporate statism. As the Centre Party, it unsuccessfully contested five seats at the 1935 New South Wales state election. The party failed to win a single seat, polling 0.60 percent of the total vote. Following the election, Campbell withdrew from public life, and both the party and the New Guard disbanded shortly afterwards. History Old Guard In response to Premier of New South Wales Jack Lang's radical agenda and maverick style within the Australian political sphere, coupled with rising pressure from trade unionists, counter-movements began to rise in opposition to the Labor Party. Among them was the Old Guard, a secret organisation purported to exist as early as 1917, which at the time of the Great Depression was administrated primarily by businessmen Roger Goldfinch and Robert Gillespie, among other anonymous committee members. The Old Guard was a coalition of imperial loyalists, devoted to the British Empire and ready to act preemptively to prevent a socialist revolution from taking place. At the height of its popularity the organisation enjoyed close ties with the NSW Police Force, Attorney-General’s Department and the Department of Defence, and boasted 30,000 members comprising strongly of rural New South Welshmen and wealthy Protestant Anglo-Saxons. Old-New Guard schism Among the Old Guard's members was World War I veteran Eric Campbell, an army officer and former gunner with the First Australian Imperial Force. Campbell had been introduced to the Old Guard by John Scott, a fellow member of the board of Sydney insurance company Sun Insurance. Over time, Campbell grew discontented with the Old Guard. The organisation was sworn to absolute secrecy of membership, and was divided into cells so that its leadership would be hard to identify. Campbell disagreed with this arrangement, asserting that the uncommunicative nature of its leadership to its members, mostly returned servicemen, was ill-fitting to their nature as soldiers. He believed that without clear authority and direction, the Old Guard would be unable to retain members. Unable to convince the committee to change its administrative strategy, he and John Scott left the Old Guard. A week after Campbell's resignation, he and others from the Old Guard agreed, in mid-February, to form a separate body which would be diametrically opposed to the Old Guard’s secrecy and what they considered its inaction. The New Guard was officially formed on 16 March 1931, built on a common ideological system of monarchism, classic liberalism and anti-communism. Campbell was voted Chief Commander. Within a few weeks its membership had swelled. Anti-leftist action (1931-32) Captain de Groot declares the Sydney Harbour Bridge open in March 1932. Whilst the New Guard has been described as a \\"paramilitary\\" group, its military capability was extremely limited and vastly overstated by its leadership. It was amateurish, ineffectual and likened to the Keystone Cops. During the initial growth of the movement, Campbell was able to attract many ex-soldiers and ex-commanders to the movement, with ex-military making up the majority of the group's membership, including the likes of early aviator Charles Kingsford Smith and North Sydney Mayor Hubert Primrose. As general commanding officer, Campbell organized it on military lines. He claimed that, in an 'emergency', it could maintain essential services including Bunnerong power house and the police attested to the Guard's efficiency. With a peak membership of over 50,000, the Guard rallied in public, broke up 'Communist' meetings, drilled, vilified the Labor Party and demanded the deportation of Communists. Campbell and his New Guard proceeded to secure connections and weapons so that, in the event of a statewide communist revolt in which the police had become ineffective, he could seize control of essential services and keep them operational. An attempt to clothe its members in uniforms failed, however, when the Guard could not go through with its order for lack of funds. Campbell's naïve offer to step in to break a seamen's strike in October 1931 was rebuffed by shipowners. Violent clashes Assisted by motorcar, the New Guard developed a strategy where they would regularly disrupt left-wing workers' meetings and New guard members spent much of the summer of 1932 driving around doing so. During December 1931, Captain Francis de Groot organised around 1,000 New Guardsmen to attack leftist meetings. On 11 December 1931, three policemen were injured in a fight between New Guardsmen and communists in Darlinghurst. On 13 February 1932, 700 New Guardsmen practised military drills in Belmore and a number of journalists who attempted to document the drills were assaulted. A few days later, 13 members of the New Guard were arrested after violently disrupting a political meeting in Coffs Harbour. Violent attacks on leftist meetings continued for weeks as part of a 'general mobilisation'. De Groot had stated that he 'felt that, the best reply to force, was greater force' and by May 1932 Campbell had started inciting street brawls, and came close to staging a coup d'etat against the Lang government. Against this backdrop the state Labor party formed a number of militias including the Workers' Defence Army (WDA), the Labor Defence Corps (LDC) and Lang's supporters had formed the Australian Labor Army (ALA). Street fights between Lang's Labor Army and fascist paramilitary groups including Sir Thomas Blamey's Victorian-based White Army and the New Guard became increasingly common as the New Guard attempted to discredit the left by starting brawls or other breaches of the peace. Though the New Guard sought to work as a supplement to the police in the event of a socialist revolution, they were oftentimes opposed under orders from the Lang government. As an exercise the New Guard attempted to measure the strength of the Sydney police force by organising many small unapproved street meetings across the city in an attempt to stretch their men thin. When forced to disperse by police each group of New Guardsmen would peacefully disperse and simply reform nearby. According to a contact Campbell had in the NSW Police Force, the police were reporting large street gatherings and were requesting reinforcements from all over the city. Opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge On 19 March 1932, the New Guard interrupted the much-anticipated opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The New Guard had wanted the bridge opened by Sir Philip Game open the bridge on behalf of King George V, but Lang refused, stating that \\"I will open it myself, it'll be cheaper\\". The New Guard declared that Lang would not perform the ceremony, with Campbell calling Lang a 'tyrant and scoundrel' and declaring that Lang would never open the Harbour Bridge. Rumors began to circulate of a plot to kidnap Lang. During the opening ceremony army officer and zone commander Francis de Groot upstaged Jack Lang by slashing the ceremonial ribbon with his sword. De Groot was supplied with a horse by fellow New Guardsmen Albert Reichard and he rode to the ceremony in his World War I 15th Hussars uniform, managing to slash the ribbon before Lang. De Groot was pulled from his horse and detained, later being fined £9 (equivalent to $859.99 in 2017). The Mayor of North Sydney, Hubert Primrose, an official participant at the opening ceremony, was also a member of the New Guard. Assault on Jock Garden On 6 May 1932, Trades and Labour Council secretary John (Jock) Garden, an influential member of Lang's inner circle, was assaulted by members a New Guard faction known as the Fascist Legion. Garden was assaulted at his home by eight hooded men in Ku Klux Klan-like gowns. The incident caused massive resignations from the New Guard. Decline 1932 constitutional crisis On 13 May of the same year, Lang was dismissed from his premiership. Along with an inner faction of the New Guard’s involvement in orchestrating the bashing of Communist Party of Australia founder Jock Garden, the New Guard began to lose popularity as the organisation’s purpose was perceived as having been fulfilled. The activities of militant splinter groups emerging from the New Guard, such as the Fascist Legion, also contributed to a rush of resignations which began even before Lang's dismissal. By mid 1932, the New Guard was largely a spent force. With their main objective complete – the removal of Lang from office – the New Guard continued to lose members as it drifted into the mid 1930s. Even de Groot left the organisation in November 1932 to pursue collaboration with the Melbourne-based League of National Security by which the White Army was also known. It was during this time that Campbell began to outline more fully his political beliefs, producing a series of broadcasts in which he developed a \\"complete credo for a fascist State\\", most notably incorporating a \\"non- elective cabinet or commission, a corporative assembly, vocational franchise and a charter of liberty\\". He also stated his intentions to contest the next state election, a date for which had not yet been set. 1933: Exploration into fascism Campbell’s memoirs state that due to the New Guard’s opposition to party politics and unwillingness to align themselves with either side, they were often dubbed \\"fascists\\". Though the New Guard bore resemblance to the militant Blackshirts in Italy, its strong adherence to individualism found it disqualified it from this definition. Campbell was curious to learn about fascism from the source however, so in 1933 during an overseas business trip, he met with Sir Oswald Mosley and wife Lady Cynthia at their London home to discuss the matter. His experience was overall positive, and while unimpressed with the members of Mosley’s British Union of Fascists, he was reminded of his own New Guardmen when he attended an Imperial Fascist League meeting. With Mosley’s recommendations he later progressed to Berlin where, unable to meet Chancellor of Germany Adolf Hitler, he was able to see Foreign Affairs Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, as well as Alfred Rosenberg. In Rome he was likewise unable to see Mussolini, instead meeting with Secretary Achille Starace, though their mutual unintelligibility and failure to use French as a medium was no use. Nevertheless, Campbell’s tour across the fascist powers of Europe left him deeply impressed with the ideology. However, on his return to Australia, Campbell's support for an \\"openly pro-fascist policy\\" was met with strong opposition from the Guard's \\"anti-fascist moderates\\". These attempts to establish the movement as what historian Keith Amos dubs \\"Australia's first fascist party\\" are thought to hastened the decline of the New Guard, with many previous members unhappy with the ideological progression that had taken place. One year later he would pen his manifesto The New Road which put forward his case for an Australian application of Italian corporate statism. 1935 state election One idea expressed in Campbell’s manifesto was that the emergence of a \\"centre party\\" in Australia was inevitable. While initially satisfied by the prospects of a United Australia Party-led purging of communism and other socialistic and anti-communist dogmas from the continent, Campbell had realised that the central tenets of the New Guard could not be fulfilled due to those politicians' ineffectiveness in bringing them about. Becoming fully dissatisfied with the politics that had, in his words, \\"degenerated into a number of sordid business undertakings\\", the New Guard entered into party politics. The Centre Party was officially established in December 1933 at a meeting of over 1,000 people, with The Sydney Morning Herald reporting that 100 branches of the party would be established.(5 December 1933). \\"NEW PARTY: ADJUNCT OF NEW GUARD\\" – The Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 3 July 2014. The majority of the shrinking organisation endorsed its move into electoral politics, which was, according to Campbell, \\"necessitated by the failure of the UAP governments, at both federal and state levels, to accede to the New Guard's demands\\". Due to a lack of time needed to organise the campaign, the party did not contest the September 1934 federal election. An August 1934 meeting of the New Guard reaffirmed Campbell as leader, and resolved to \\"make itself felt in the next State elections\\".(2 August 1934). \\"NEW GUARD: Colonel Campbell Re-elected Leader\\" – The Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 12 June 2014. At the May 1935 New South Wales state election, the Centre Party contested five out of the 90 Legislative Assembly districts, all in suburban Sydney, and polled 0.60 percent of the total vote. In two seats, Hornsby, contested by Fergus Munro, and Lane Cove, contested by Campbell, only the Centre Party and the United Australia Party fielded candidates, with the former polling over 15 percent of the vote in both seats. In the other seats it contested, the Centre Party candidates failed to poll more than 5 percent of the vote. The party's relatively high vote in Hornsby and Lane Cove is thought to have represented \\"merely the level of protest against [UAP Premier] Stevens\\" in the absence of other candidates. In Arncliffe, the only seat that required a preference distribution, the majority (56.78%) of Centre Party preferences flowed to the United Australia candidate, Horace Harper, who was defeated by Labor's Joseph Cahill, a future premier.

With the exception of occasional speaking engagements, Campbell himself largely withdrew from public life following the election, and spent most of the rest of his life in country New South Wales, where he was president of the Burrangong Shire Council in 1949 and 1950 (now part of Young Shire).\\"The Young Municipal Council and Burrangong Shire amalgamated in 1980…\\" Ray Christison (2008). Thematic History of Young Shire , p. 75. Retrieved 7 July 2014. Campbell's 1965 autobiographical account of his involvement in the New Guard, The Rallying Point, considered \\"confused\\", \\"highly unreliable\\" and a work of \\"historical fiction\\" by Moore in any event, does not mention the Centre Party at all. Later writers have suggested that the party's lack of success at the 1935 election represented \\"an electoral brick-wall\\", with the party overall a \\"failure\\" and Campbell's movement having \\"lost most of its drive\\". Differences between the Guards Though the New Guard’s ideology began to differ from the Old Guard’s over time, the primary differences between the Guards were more in their pragmatics rather than ideology. The two groups remained very similar in their values and purposes, their distaste for selfish machine politics, their extremist/socialist targets, and even to some extent in their methods. Indeed, in its first weeks, the New Guard tried hard to negotiate acceptable terms for amalgamation. Some support for reunion continued even after this approach ended in April 1931. One difficulty in assessing the New Guard's impact in comparison to that of the Old Guard is that other separate but similar groups were also active, so that it was not always easy to assign responsibility for particular activities. In the countryside many groups, including the Riverina Movement, protesting against perceived neglect, saw possible escape from Sydney domination and an opportunity to dissociate themselves from the New South Welshmen that had chosen their fate under Lang. Behind the scenes a well connected Old Guard exercised considerable influence within such groups, through a network of relationships with traditional country institutions. Organisation At its inception, the administrative structure of the New Guard consisted of an Organising Committee lead by a Chairman with powers to add more committee members by way of a unanimous vote. This committee would be tasked with the recruitment of members and their separation by localities across the Sydney and regional New South Wales areas. Following the meeting at Cahill’s, the structure of the organisation was revised in an attempt to exercise \\"practical democracy\\". The power allotted to each position in the New Guard changed as the organisation was built. The area of Greater Sydney would be broken down into four independent Zones: A Zone, consisting of the land north of Sydney Harbour; B Zone, covering the Eastern Suburbs as well as from the coastline down to Maroubra; C Zone, incorporating the Southern Suburbs down to and including the Sutherland Shire; and D Zone, including the Western Suburbs to the west of Parramatta. These Zones would be divided into Divisions and then subdivided into Localities. As part of Campbell’s practical democratic solution, each Locality would operate as independent units where a few hundred New Guardsmen would select for themselves a Locality Commanders and Administrator to handle affairs, and each Locality would frequently meet at Locality Conventions to discuss and vote on matters. The Locality Commanders of each Division would select Divisional Commanders, and said Divisional Commanders would meet to pick the Zone Commander for their respective Zone. Divisional and Zone Commanders would only assume active command positions when more than one of their respective subdivisions were active in a particular objective, therefore making Localities especially independent in the operation of the New Guard. The executive branch of the New Guard was the General Council, consisting of the leading Chief Commander and four Zone Commanders with equal voting power. The General Council was only to make decisions regarding major executive matters, and questions regarding routine and defensive emergencies would be directed to the Chief Commander, or Deputy Chief Commander if the former was absent. During the period of structural preparation the Chief Commander was to not interfere in the movement’s formation, and only assume complete executive involvement once the Locality system was completely established. To put checks on the General Council’s power, Campbell formed the Council of Action, consisting of the Chief Commander and Divisional Commanders; the Chief Commander would be deprived of a vote. Intelligence on the New Guard’s political rivals would be collected by the individual Localities and submitted to the Chief of the Intelligence Branch for collation. While being essential to the New Guard’s functionality, it was sometimes inaccurate in its intelligence gathering. Flawed analysis of the political demographics of Sydney found that there were 252,473 Communists in ten Sydney electorates alone. As Campbell allowed considerable independence for the Localities and permitted members to associate freely with any political party so long that the New Guard’s central values were upheld, splinter groups such as the Fascist Legion (also known as the Pack of Cards) formed. Legion members wore Ku Klux Klan-style gowns and hoods at their own internal meetings in order to guarantee anonymity, adopting pseudonyms based on particular playing cards in a standard 52-card deck (excluding queens). Keeping with the theme of playing cards, the Fascist Legion's leader was led by \\"the Joker\\". Its membership was estimated at 49. Besides investigating disloyalty and laxity within the New Guard, they purportedly engaged in targeted operations such as the aforementioned attack on Jock Garden. They were reported to be planning kidnappings and police arm store raids. The activity of splinter groups such as the Fascist Legion contributed to the bleeding of members in the lead-up to Lang’s dismissal by Sir Philip Game. Membership Standards for New Guard membership had prospective members picked irrespective of class, financial situation or party affiliations, so long as they were of good character. For maximal utility, the membership system was split into three groups: *A class - Members who were physically able, and could be employed for operations both within Localities and outside its boundaries if needed *B class - Members with technical qualifications, regardless of age, who could assist in the maintenance of essential services such as water, electricity and transport services, among others, in the event of a socialist revolution *C class - Members that due to their age or personality could only be trusted to handle operations within their own Locality New Guardsmen of their own Locality were encouraged to participate during Locality Conventions to decide matters specific to their area. A member was not kept within the organisation against their will, as they could leave at any time for any reason. This was to ensure that the New Guard could preserve its democratic, voluntary elements established at its founding. Estimates of the New Guard’s membership count are contradictory. A report conducted by the NSW Police in September 1931 found 87,000 had sought membership and by December of the same year there were 39,000 card-carrying members – with 3,000 residing in the country centres of regional NSW. For practical reasons, Campbell’s internal estimations of membership count focused on those that the New Guard could rely on in the event of a socialist revolution. In that he estimated the figure at 20,000. For propaganda reasons, New Guard membership was often publicly exaggerated, as when Campbell foreshadowed a procession of 100,000 men along Macquarie Street to present a petition to Sir Game.

Lockhart was born into a gentry family in 1721 and embarked on a naval career. He served on a number of ships during the War of the Austrian Succession, seeing action at both the First and Second Battles of Cape Finisterre, having by then risen to the rank of lieutenant. He had his own commands by the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, and enjoyed particular success as a frigate captain, cruising against privateers while in command of . Further commands followed, including roles in detached squadrons at the Battle of Quiberon Bay. Taking the additional name Ross after he inherited a deceased relative's estates, he served as a member of parliament and undertook land reforms and improvements during the years of peace before the outbreak of the American War of Independence. Lockhart-Ross returned to sea on the outbreak of war, commanding a ship at the Battle of Ushant, and later being promoted to flag rank. He served in several actions as a junior commander of Rodney's fleet, including the capture of the Caracas convoy, the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and the relief of Gibraltar. He then retired ashore, devoting himself to his estates until his death in 1790. He was succeeded in the baronetcy he had inherited in 1778 by his son. Family and early life Lockhart was born on 11 November 1721 at Lockhart Hall, Lanarkshire, the fifth son of Sir James Lockhart, 2nd Baronet.James Stanier Clarke and Stephen Jones, \\"The Naval Chronicle\\" (Page 44); Published by J. Gold, 1801 His mother, Grizel, was the third daughter of William Ross, 12th Lord Ross. Lockhart joined the navy in September 1735, serving first aboard the 50-gun under Captain Henry Osborne. He transferred to the 50-gun under Captain Charles Knowles in the West Indies between 1737 and 1738, and went on to serve aboard the 54-gun under Captain Henry Medley in 1739, and the 14-gun sloop under Captain Frogmere in 1740. Lockhart followed Frogmere to several of his ships, serving under him aboard the 20-gun and then the 54-gun . He passed his lieutenant's examination on 28 September 1743, and received his commission with a posting on 21 October that year to the 44-gun in the North Sea, and afterwards on the coast of North America. While serving on the North American station he was moved into the 50-gun and returned to England with her in late 1746. Lockhart's next appointment was to the 66-gun in April 1747. Devonshire was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Peter Warren, under whom Lockhart saw action at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre on 3 May 1747. He was then appointed to his first command, that of the fireship , in which he saw action with Sir Edward Hawke's fleet at the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre on 16 October 1747. One of the captains in the battle, Thomas Fox of the 64-gun , was later relieved of his command after controversy over his actions in the engagement, and Lockhart was given temporary command of Kent in his place. During 1748 Lockhart was first lieutenant of the Portsmouth guardship , and for the next few years was on half pay in Scotland. In January 1755 he was appointed first lieutenant of the 90-gun with Captain Charles Saunders, and on 22 April 1755 he was promoted to command the 8-gun sloop , attached during the year to the western squadron cruising under the command of Sir Edward Hawke or Vice-Admiral John Byng. Command Captain Sir John Lockhart Ross (1721-90) RMG RS9673 On 23 March 1756 Lockhart was posted to the 28-gun , which he commanded for several cruises in the Channel, capturing several large privateers of equal or superior force, among them the 22-gun Cerf with 211 men, the 26-gun Grand Gideon with 190 men, and the 20-gun Mont-Ozier of Rochelle with 170 men. Lockhart was severely wounded in the capture of the Mont-Ozier on 17 February 1757, and had to be invalided on shore for the next two months. He rejoined the Tartar and on 15 April, off Dunnose, Isle of Wight, he captured the 26-gun Duc d'Aiguillon of St. Malo with 254 men; and on 2 November the 36-gun Melampe with 320 men. The latter ship was added to the navy as the 36-gun frigate . As a reward for Lockhart's services, the Admiralty offered him the command of the 50-gun , which was then nearing completion, and making several promotions from Tartars crew. He was also presented by the merchants of London and of Bristol with pieces of plate ‘for his signal service in supporting the trade;’ and by the corporation of Plymouth with the freedom of the borough in a gold box. Lockhart spent the next few months recuperating at Bath and waiting for the Chatham to be launched. She was duly launched in April 1758 and Lockhart took command, taking many of his officers and men from Tartar to crew her, with the Admiralty's permission. Lockhart had her fitted for sea by May, and spent June to September cruising against privateers in the North Sea. Chatham was then ordered into the Channel and later joined the fleet under Sir Edward Hawke. She spent the summer under Rear-Admiral George Brydges Rodney, taking part in the Raid on Le Havre before rejoining Hawke in October, and then being sent to join a squadron under Commodore Robert Duff, to watch the French in Quiberon Bay. The squadron observed the French fleet sail out, and were chased by them as they rushed to report the news to Hawke. Hawke brought his fleet against them and decisively defeated them at the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. Four days later Hawke appointed Lockhart to command in the place of Captain John Campbell, who was sent home with the despatches. In the end of January 1760 the Royal George came to Spithead, and a month later Lockhart was appointed to command the 64-gun , forming part of the fleet under Hawke or Edward Boscawen. Later naval and parliamentary career Balnagown Castle With the death of his brother James in September 1760 Lockhart succeeded to the Ross estate of Balnagown, the entail of which obliged him to take the name of Ross; this he formally did in the following spring, announcing the change to the admiralty on 31 March 1761. He was then at Lockhart Hall, where he seems to have passed the winter on leave, but afterwards rejoined the Bedford during the summer. In September he applied to be relieved from the command, and on 27 September was placed on half pay. In the previous June he had been elected member of parliament for Lanark Burghs, but it does not appear that he took any active interest in parliamentary business. He devoted himself principally to the improvement of his estates and the condition of the peasantry, and became known as ‘the best farmer and the greatest planter in the country; his wheat and turnips showed the one, his plantation of a million of pines the other’. He was MP for Lanark Burghs from 1761 to 1768 and in 1762, he initiated land tenure reform which would later evolve into the Highland Clearances.Eric Richards, \\"The History of the Highland Clearances\\" (Page 249); He was MP for Lanarkshire from 1768 to 1774.Leigh Rayment In 1777, when war with France appeared imminent, Ross returned to active service, and was appointed to the 74-gun , joining the fleet under Admiral Augustus Keppel in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. On 13 August, by the successive deaths of his elder brothers without male issue, he succeeded to the baronetcy. On 19 March 1779 he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral, and during the summer, with his flag in the Royal George, he was fourth in command in the Channel. In September he was sent with a small squadron into the North Sea to look out for John Paul Jones, but Jones, after capturing the Serapis in 1779, made good his escape. Continuing in the Channel Fleet, Ross was with Rodney at the capture of the Caracas convoy, the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and the relief of Gibraltar in January 1780; with George Darby at the relief of Gibraltar in April 1781; and with Lord Howe during the early summer of 1782. On the return of the fleet to Spithead in August he resigned his command, and had no further employment afloat. He became a vice-admiral on 24 September 1787, and died at Balnagown Castle in Ross-shire on 9 June 1790. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Dundas of Arniston, the younger, in 1762 and had a number of children. Among them was his eldest son, Charles Lockhart- Ross, an army officer who inherited the baronetcy on his father's death, and George Ross, father of distinguished legal writer George Ross.

Manufactured by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, the X-45 was a part of DARPA's J-UCAS project. Development Boeing developed the X-45 from research gathered during the development of the Bird of Prey. The X-45 features an extremely low-profile dorsal intake placed near the leading edge of the aircraft. The center fuselage is blended into a swept lambda wing, with a small exhaust outlet. It has no vertical control surfaces — split ailerons near each wingtip function as asymmetric air brakes, providing rudder control, much as in Northrop's flying wings. X-45A test flight Removing the pilot and its associated facilities from the aircraft dramatically reduces the aircraft's cost. Ground-based pilots execute the higher level decisions, but the mechanical flying of the aircraft is autonomous. Variants X-45A Boeing built two of the model X-45A; both were scaled-down proof-of-concept aircraft. The first was completed by Boeing's Phantom Works in September 2000. The goal of the X-45A technology demonstrator program was to develop the technologies needed to \\"conduct suppression of enemy air defense missions with unmanned combat air vehicles.\\" The first generation of unmanned combat air vehicles are primarily planned for air-to-ground roles with defensive air-to-air capabilities coupled with significant remote piloting. X-45A underside with weapons bay door open The X-45A had its first flight on May 22, 2002, and the second vehicle followed in November of that year. On April 18, 2004, the X-45A's first bombing run test at Edwards Air Force Base was successful; it hit a ground target with a 250-pound inert precision-guided munition. On August 1, 2004, for the first time, two X-45As were controlled in flight simultaneously by one ground-based pilot. On February 4, 2005, on their 50th flight, the two X-45As took off into a patrol pattern and were then alerted to the presence of a target. The X-45As then autonomously determined which vehicle held the optimum position, weapons (notional), and fuel load to properly attack the target. After making that decision, one of the X-45As changed course and the ground-based pilot authorized the consent to attack the simulated antiaircraft emplacement. Following a successful strike, another simulated threat, this time disguised, emerged and was subsequently destroyed by the second X-45A.The 50th flight: Two X-45s work autonomously as a group and successfully attack previously undetected targets This demonstrated the ability of these vehicles to work autonomously as a team and manage their resources, as well as to engage previously-undetected targets, which is significantly harder than following a predetermined attack path. After the completion of the flight test program, both X-45As were sent to museums, one to the National Air and Space Museum, and the other to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, where it was inducted on November 13, 2006.Boeing news release The X-45A introduced yaw axis thrust vectoring.https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/speed-bump-usaf-sets- modest-goals-for-new-bomber-214539/ X-45B/C The newer, larger X-45C X-45C from the side The larger X-45B design was modified to have even more fuel capacity and three times greater combat range, becoming the X-45C. Each wing's leading edge spans from the nose to the wingtip, giving the aircraft more wing area, and a planform very similar to the B-2 Spirits'. The first of the three planned X-45C aircraft was originally scheduled to be completed in 2006, with capability demonstrations scheduled for early 2007. By 2010, Boeing hoped to complete an autonomous aerial refueling of the X-45C by a KC-135 Stratotanker. Boeing has displayed a mock-up of the X-45C on static displays at many airshows. The X-45C portion of the program received $767 million from DARPA in October 2004, to construct and test three aircraft, along with several supplemental goals. The X-45C included an F404 engine.\\"Boeing Receives First Engines for X-45C UCAV\\" . Boeing, November 18, 2004.

Manga artist Kamui Fujiwara is credited with the character designs. Terranigma tells the story of the Earth's resurrection by the hands of a boy named Ark, and its progress from the evolution of life to the present day. It was published by Enix in Japan before Nintendo localized the game and released English, German, French and Spanish versions in Europe and Australia. The game has never been officially released in North America. Gameplay The game keeps a top-down perspective view of the world and utilizes an action-based real-time battle system that allows the player to perform different techniques depending on whether the protagonist is running, jumping, attacking, or using a combination of these three actions. Each attack is meant for dealing more damage to certain kinds of enemies, though in most cases there is little to no difference regardless of the technique used. Projectiles launched at Ark can be blocked by the guard technique, which is otherwise ineffective against melee attacks. With each victory, experience points are gained, increasing the protagonist's level and his maximum hit points, strength, defense, and luck. Slain enemies sometimes leave behind gems which can be used to buy weapons, armors, healing items, and spells. There are no magic points in the game, all spells take the form of one-time use items instead. The player must collect Magirocks and take them to a magic shop to have them transformed into magic rings and summon medals. Those items are used up when casting the corresponding spell and then turn back to Magirocks which may be exchanged for new spells again. Upon defeating bosses and completing miscellaneous tasks, new types of magic become available. Plot Setting In Terranigma, the planet is portrayed as a hollow sphere (though the map in the game is mathematically a torus) that has both an external and internal face. Since the beginning of the Earth, the external Lightside, the surface world, stood for growth whereas the internal Darkside, the under world, represented decline. Over the course of billions of years, these two forces came to be called God and Devil. Regardless of this inner antagonism, rapid progress took root and primitive life forms evolved to plants, animals, and humans. Technology and industry further expanded civilization, but the fight between God and the Devil was still taking place, more fiercely than ever. The conflict culminated in a final battle in Antarctica, on the surface world. However, neither of the two forces were victorious. The continents of the surface world submerged into the sea and the under world was sealed away. Story Ark fights enemies in the first dungeon area. The first chapter of the game, \\"The Outset,\\" introduces Ark, a mischievous boy who lives in Crysta, the only village in the under world. After opening a forbidden door and touching a mysterious box containing a friendly demon named Yomi, every citizen in the village is frozen. The only person not affected by the curse, the Elder, guides him to resurrect the continents of the surface world in order to unfreeze the people. A way out of his hometown appears, and for the first time ever, a human being leaves Crysta to explore the under world, which is portrayed as a frozen wasteland of imposing crystal mountains, crossed by rivers of magma. He conquers the trials of the five towers, each representing one continent, and revives the mainland of the Earth. Upon returning to his hometown, the Elder instructs him to travel to the surface world and to resurrect all living beings. With a heavy heart, Ark says goodbye to his lifelong devoted friend Elle and sets out to the Lightside. In the second chapter, \\"Resurrection of the World,\\" after having crossed a dimensional crevasse, Ark is confronted with the barren land that was once the Earth's surface. His first task is to free the giant tree Ra from a parasite that is afflicting him. This causes the resurrection of all plants in the world, helping Ark to cross the mountains of Guiana. He travels further into the world, reviving birds, the wind, animals, and eventually mankind. In the third chapter, \\"Resurrection of the Genius,\\" the Elder appears to Ark in a dream and tells him to keep helping humanity grow, as the world is still in the fledgling stages. He continues his journey, traveling and expanding cities, assisting with the invention of groundbreaking technologies, and also—much to his surprise—encountering a Lightside twin of Elle, who lives as the adopted daughter of a French king but was rendered mute by a traumatic event in her childhood. Ark manages to break this condition, and although Princess Elle at first stays away from Ark, she begins to grow close to him. In continuing to follow the Elder's commands, Ark ultimately awakes the ingenious Beruga, a scientist who survived the destruction of the previous world by hiding himself in a cryogenic sleep. Beruga provides Ark with an insight into his personal image of paradise: A perfect world where all insignificant life is killed with a virus named Asmodeus and everyone else is made immortal by turning them into zombies. Ark tries to attack Beruga after this revealing twist but is stopped by robots, injuring him severely in the process. The Elder once again appears to him, saying that his mission is fulfilled and he may now pass away. Ark realizes that he's been used by Dark Gaia (the \\"Devil\\"), whose plans of world domination required Ark to resurrect the planet. Just as he is about to die, Kumari, a wise human who watched the world's growth through reincarnation, teleports Ark out of Beruga's laboratory. He then instructs him to go search the five Starstones and to lay them at the grave at Time's End in order to call the Golden Child. Ark obtains the stones one after another and sets them into skull statues at Dryvale, the location at the South Pole where the final confrontation between God and the Devil once took place. This leads to the appearance of Ark's Lightside self; the person Dark Gaia used to create Ark himself. His Lightside self reveals to him that he, the underworld Ark, is the legendary hero and then kills him. However, in the fourth and final chapter, \\"Resurrection of the Hero,\\" Ark is reborn as a baby through the soul of the surface world, Light Gaia. He is kidnapped by Darkside Elle, who was led there by Yomi to eliminate a threat to Crysta. When she realizes this threat is actually Ark, she allows him to awaken as the legendary hero and grow back into an adult in the process. Yomi then decides to kill Ark by himself and reveals he has been working for Dark Gaia all along. He fails, as Darkside Elle sacrifices herself to kill Yomi and save Ark's life. Afterwards, Ark departs to defeat Beruga. After he conquers the professor, he returns to the underworld to defeat Dark Gaia. The victory over that entity brings forth the destruction of the Darkside. In the end, Ark realizes that as a creation of Dark Gaia, he, along with the village of Crysta and the underworld, shall now vanish with the Devil's demise, though it is implied he and his loved ones in Crysta will be reincarnated. He goes to sleep, after being told by Light Gaia that he, as creator and defender, is what the humans would call a god. Ark's last dream pictures him as a bird flying above the world that he helped to exist, watching it grow older. An epilogue plays which shows Lightside Elle at her original home. There is a knock at the door, and she answers it. The game then ends. Development Terranigma was developed by the Japanese company Quintet, which had previously designed creation-themed Super NES games such as ActRaiser and Soul Blazer. In fact, game journalists often consider Terranigma to be part of an unofficial trilogy with the games Illusion of Gaia and Soul Blazer. Publisher Enix commissioned the developers as a subcontractor and decided for the title to be an action role-playing game for strategic reasons, based on Quintet's experience in that particular genre and the good reception of their earlier games by Japanese players. The theme of creation prevalent in Terranigma was introduced as a contrast to the destruction of enemies in other action titles, and to inspire the player's imagination concerning the effects their actions might have. The script was written by director and designer Tomoyoshi Miyazaki, the founder of Quintet, with the scenario provided by Reiko Takebayashi. Tatsuo Hashimoto created the computer graphics cover art and also rendered the background images for the resurrection scenes. The music of Terranigma was composed by Miyoko Takaoka and Masanori Hikichi, the latter of whom was responsible for the design of the sounds as well.  Release  The game was released in Japan on October 20, 1995 for the Super Famicom. According to developer Quintet, Tenchi Sōzō sold 200,000 copies in Japan. Terranigma wound up never being published in North America because Enix had already closed its US subsidiary by the time the localization was finished. The English scripts of the game used in the European and Australian releases by Nintendo were translated by Colin Palmer, Dan Owsen and Hiro Nakamura. Terranigma was released alongside several pieces of merchandise in Japan, including an official guide book, a world atlas, a novel by Saori Kumi, a novelization by Norio Nakai titled Logout Bunko Tenchi Sōzō, a gamebook featuring artwork by character designer Kamui Fujiwara, and the two volume manga Gangan Fantasy Comics: Tenchi Sōzō by Mamiko Yasaka. Except for the guide book, none of these materials have been released outside Japan, though in Germany, Club Nintendo published a 32-page comic illustrating scenes from the game up to the events of the third chapter. A Japanese soundtrack album titled Tenchi Sōzō Creative Soundtracks with 33 compositions was released by Kitty Enterprises on October 25, 1995. The first six tracks are arranged versions of the game's music. Reception On release, Famicom Tsūshin scored the game a 30 out of 40.NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: 天地創造. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.358. Pg.29. 27 October 1995. Kei Kuboki of the video game magazine GameFan described it as the developer's \\"best (...) effort\\", and as being \\"among the [Super NES's] most memorable titles\\". The game was praised in German magazines. M! Games gave it a score of 80 out of 100, praising it as a good game in the Japanese action game tradition, with great level design and controls. Total! praised the varied soundtrack, ease of play, and recommended the game should be bought during the Christmas season for any fans of the genre. They also said that it would tide over fans until the release of Lufia II. MegaFun also praised the game giving it 80% score. French magazines were equally as positive. Joypad gave the game an 88, and Player One gave the game a 92. Spanish magazine Nintendo Accion gave it a 97 out of 100 score. In a retrospective review, Nintendo Life praised the game as well giving it a 10 out of 10 score.

The Holter's most common use is for monitoring ECG heart activity (electrocardiography or ECG). Its extended recording period is sometimes useful for observing occasional cardiac arrhythmias which would be difficult to identify in a shorter period. For patients having more transient symptoms, a cardiac event monitor which can be worn for a month or more can be used. The Holter monitor was developed at the Holter Research Laboratory in Helena Montana by experimental physicists Norman J. Holter and Bill Glasscock, who started work on radio telemetry in 1949. Inspired by a suggestion from cardiologist Paul Dudley White in the early 1950s, they redirected their efforts toward development of a wearable cardiac monitoring device. The Holter monitor was released for commercial production in 1962. When used to study the heart, much like standard electrocardiography, the Holter monitor records electrical signals from the heart via a series of electrodes attached to the chest. Electrodes are placed over bones to minimize artifacts from muscular activity. The number and position of electrodes varies by model, but most Holter monitors employ between three and eight. These electrodes are connected to a small piece of equipment that is attached to the patient's belt or hung around the neck, keeping a log of the heart's electrical activity throughout the recording period. A 12 lead Holter system is also available when precise ECG signal information is required to analyse the exact nature and origin of the rhythm signal.Herzschrittmacherther Elektrophysiol. 2013 Jun;24(2):92-6. doi: 10.1007/s00399-013-0268-4. Epub 2013 Jun 19. 12-lead Holter electrocardiography. Review of the literature and clinical application update. Su L1, Borov S, Zrenner B.  Data storage  Atrial fibrillation recorded by a Holter monitor Older devices used reel-to- reel tapes or a standard C90 or C120 audio cassette and ran at a 1.7 mm/s or 2 mm/s speed to record the data. Once a recording was made, it could be played back and analyzed at 60x speed so 24 hours of recording could be analyzed in 24 minutes. More modern units record an EDF-file onto digital flash memory devices. The data is uploaded into a computer which then automatically analyzes the input, counting ECG complexes, calculating summary statistics such as average heart rate, minimum and maximum heart rate, and finding candidate areas in the recording worthy of further study by the technician. Components Each Holter system consists of two basic parts – the hardware (called monitor or recorder) for recording the signal, and software for review and analysis of the record. Advanced Holter recorders are able to display the signal, which is very useful for checking the signal quality. Very often there is also a “patient button” located on the front site allowing the patient to press it in specific cases such as sickness, going to bed, taking pills, etc.; a special mark will be then placed into the record so that the doctors or technicians can quickly pinpoint these areas when analyzing the signal. Recorder The size of the recorder differs depending on the manufacturer of the device. The average dimensions of today's Holter monitors are about 110x70x30 mm but some are only 61x46x20 mm and weigh 99 g.HeartBug technical specifications Most of the devices operate with two AA batteries. In case the batteries are depleted, some Holters allow their replacement even during monitoring. Most of the Holters monitor the ECG via only two or three channels (Note: depending on manufacturer, different counts of leads and lead systems are used). Today's trend is to minimize the number of leads to ensure the patient's comfort during recording. Although two/three channel recording has been used for a long time in the Holter monitoring history, as mentioned above, 12 channel Holters have recently appeared. These systems use the classic Mason-Likar lead system, i.e. producing a signal in the same format as during the common rest ECG and/or stress test measurement. These Holters can occasionally provide information similar to that of an ECG stress test examination. They are also suitable when analyzing patients after myocardial infarction. Recordings from these 12-lead monitors are of a significantly lower resolution than those from a standard 12-lead ECG and in some cases have been shown to provide misleading ST segment representation, even though some devices allow setting the sampling frequency up to 1000 Hz for special-purpose exams such as detection of \\"late potential\\". Another innovation is the inclusion of a triaxial movement sensor, which records the patient's physical activity, and on examination and software processing, extracts three movement statuses: sleeping, standing up, or walking. Some modern devices also have the ability to record a vocal patient diary entry that can be later listened to by the doctor. These data help the cardiologist to better identify events in relation to the patient's activity and diary. Analyzing software Screenshot of Holter ECG software When the recording of ECG signal is finished (usually after 24 or 48 hours), it is up to the physician to perform the signal analysis. Since it would be extremely time demanding to browse through such a long signal, there is an integrated automatic analysis process in the software of each Holter device which automatically determines different sorts of heart beats, rhythms, etc. However the success of the automatic analysis is very closely associated with the signal quality. The quality itself mainly depends on the attachment of the electrodes to the patient body. If these are not properly attached, electromagnetic disturbance can influence the ECG signal resulting in a very noisy record. If the patient moves rapidly, the distortion will be even bigger. Such record is then very difficult to process. Besides the attachment and quality of electrodes, there are other factors affecting the signal quality, such as muscle tremors, sampling rate and resolution of the digitized signal (high quality devices offer higher sampling frequency). The automatic analysis commonly provides the physician with information about heart beat morphology, beat interval measurement, heart rate variability, rhythm overview and patient diary (moments when the patient pressed the patient button). Advanced systems also perform spectral analysis, ischemic burden evaluation, graph of patient's activity or PQ segment analysis. Another requirement is the ability of pacemaker impulses detection and analysis. Such ability may be useful when the physician desires to check for correct basic pacemaker function. History The cardiac event monitor has been used for over twenty years. At first, these devices were not portable and had to be used only in hospital buildings. Advances resulted in these devices becoming smaller but were still being used only in hospitals for twenty four to forty eight hours. Soon portable monitors were developed weighing at first thirty pounds, then 10 pounds, and 1 pound. Modern devices are much easier to wear, weighing only a fraction of a pound. Procedure Although some patients may feel uncomfortable about a Holter examination, the only hazards are potential minor skin abrasions to optimize signal quality; it should have little effect on one's normal daily life. The recording device can be worn in a case on a belt or on a strap across the chest. The device may be visible under light clothing, and those wearing a Holter monitor may wish to avoid shirts with a low neckline. Persons being monitored should not limit normal daily activities, since its purpose is to record how a heart works under various actual conditions over an extended period. It is an electrical device, however, and should be kept dry; showering or swimming should probably be avoided. Monitors can be removed for a few minutes without invalidating collected data, but proper reattachment is critical to avoid degradation of its signals. Beyond changing batteries, one should leave its handling to trained personnel.

He was Professor of Mathematical Physics at the California Institute of Technology and Princeton University. Robertson made important contributions to the mathematics of quantum mechanics, general relativity and differential geometry. Applying relativity to cosmology, he independently developed the concept of an expanding universe. His name is most often associated with the Poynting–Robertson effect, the process by which solar radiation causes a dust mote orbiting a star to lose angular momentum, which he also described in terms of general relativity. During World War II, Robertson served with the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). He served as Technical Consultant to the Secretary of War, the OSRD Liaison Officer in London, and the Chief of the Scientific Intelligence Advisory Section at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. After the war Robertson was director of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1950 to 1952, chairman of the Robertson Panel on UFOs in 1953 and Scientific Advisor to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in 1954 and 1955. He was Chairman of the Defense Science Board from 1956 to 1961, and a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) from 1957 to 1961.  Early life  Howard Percy Robertson, was born in Hoquiam, Washington, on January 27, 1903, the oldest of five children of George Duncan Robertson, an engineer who built bridges in Washington state, and Anna McLeod, a nurse. His father died when he was 15 years old, but although money was short, all five siblings attended university. He entered the University of Washington in Seattle in 1918, initially with the intention of studying engineering, but he later switched to mathematics. He earned a bachelor of science degree in mathematics in 1922 and a master of science in mathematics and physics in 1923. In 1923 Robertson married Angela Turinsky, a philosophy and psychology student at the University of Washington. They had two children: George Duncan, who became a surgeon, and Marietta, who later married California Institute of Technology (Caltech) historian Peter W. Fay. At the University of Washington he also met Eric Temple Bell, who encouraged him to pursue mathematics at Caltech. Robertson completed his PhD dissertation in mathematics and physics there in 1925 under the supervision of Harry Bateman, writing \\"On Dynamical Space-Times Which Contain a Conformal Euclidean 3-Space\\". Upon receipt of his doctorate, Robertson received a National Research Council Fellowship to study at the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he met David Hilbert, Richard Courant, Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, Karl and Martin Schwarzschild, John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner. He found Max Born unsympathetic to his concept of an expanding universe, which Born considered \\"rubbish\\". He also spent six months at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he was a post-doctoral student of Arnold Sommerfeld.  Mathematics  Robertson returned to the United States in 1927, and became an assistant professor of mathematics at Caltech. In 1928, he accepted a position as an assistant professor of mathematical physics at Princeton University, where he became an associate professor in 1931, and a professor in 1938. He spent 1936 on sabbatical at Caltech. His interest in general relativity and differential geometry led to a series of papers in the 1920s that developed the subject. Robertson wrote three important papers on the mathematics of quantum mechanics. In the first, written in German, he looked at the coordinate system required for the Schrödinger equation to be solvable. The second examined the relationship between the commutative property and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The third extended the second to the case of m observables. In 1931 he published a translation of Weyl's The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics. It was Robertson's anonymous 1936 critical peer review of a paper submitted by Albert Einstein to Physical Review which caused Einstein to withdraw the paper from consideration.\\"Einstein Versus the Physical Review,\\" Physics Today, vol. 58, no. 9, p. 43, September 1, 2005. (John T. Tate, Sr. was the editor who sent the paper to Robertson for review.)\\"Reviewing Einstein,\\" Science, vol. 349, no. 6244, p. 149, July 10, 2015. Yet perhaps Robertson's most notable achievements were in applying relativity to cosmology. He independently developed the concept of an expanding universe, which would imply distant galaxies as seen from Earth would be redshifted – a phenomenon previously confirmed by Vesto Slipher . Robertson went on to apply the theory of continuous groups in Riemann spaces to find all the solutions that describe the cosmological spaces. This was extended by Arthur Geoffrey Walker in 1936, and is today widely known in the United States as the Robertson–Walker metric. One of Robertson's landmark papers, a brief note in The Annals of Mathematics, entitled a \\"Note on the preceding paper: The two body problem in general relativity\\", solved that problem within a degree of approximation not improved on for several decades. Earlier work, such as the Schwarzschild metric, were for a central body that did not move, while Robertson's solution considered two bodies orbiting each other. Nevertheless, his solution failed to include gravitational radiation, so the bodies orbit forever, rather than approaching each other. Yet Robertson's name is most often associated with the Poynting–Robertson effect, the process by which solar radiation causes a dust mote orbiting a star to lose angular momentum. This is related to radiation pressure tangential to the grain's motion. John Henry Poynting described it in 1903 based on the \\"luminiferous aether\\" theory, which was superseded by Einstein's theories of relativity. In 1937, Robertson described the effect in terms of general relativity. Robertson developed the theory of invariants of tensors to derive the Kármán–Howarth equation in 1940, which was later used by George Batchelor and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in the theory of axisymmetric turbulence to derive Batchelor–Chandrasekhar equation.Robertson, H. P. (1940, April). The invariant theory of isotropic turbulence. In Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (Vol. 36, No. 2, pp. 209–223). Cambridge University Press  World War II  Aside from his work in physics, Robertson played a central role in American scientific intelligence during and after World War II. He was approached by Richard Tolman shortly after World War II began in 1939, and began working for the Committee for Passive Protection Against Bombing. This was absorbed with other groups into Division 2 of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), with Robertson engaged in the study of terminal ballistics. In 1943, Robertson became the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) chief scientific liaison officer in London. He became close friends with Reginald Victor Jones, and Solly Zuckerman praised the work Robertson and Jones did on scrambling radar beams and beacons. In 1944 Robertson also became a Technical Consultant to the Secretary of War, and the Chief of the Scientific Intelligence Advisory Section at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. His fluency in German helped him to interrogate German scientists, including rocket scientists involved in the V-2 rocket program. He was awarded the Medal for Merit for his contributions to the war effort.  Later life  After the war, Robertson accepted a professorship at Caltech in 1947. He would remain there for the rest of his career, except for long periods of government service. He was a Central Intelligence Agency classified employee and director of the Weapons System Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense,. the Weapons System Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1950 to 1952, and Scientific Advisor in 1954 and 1955 to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), General Alfred M. Gruenther. In 1953 he chaired the Robertson Panel, which investigated a wave of UFO reports in 1952. He was Chairman of the Defense Science Board from 1956 to 1961, and a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) from 1957 to 1961. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, serving as its foreign secretary from 1958 until his death in 1961, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Mathematical Society, the American Physical Society, the American Astronomical Society, the American Philosophical Society, the Operational Research Society, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. In August 1961, Robertson was hospitalized after being injured in a car accident. He suffered a pulmonary embolism and died on August 26, 1961. He was survived by his wife and children. His papers were donated to the Caltech Archives by his daughter and son-in-law in 1971.

The conflagration began at 7:20 p.m. on Saturday, November 9, 1872, in the basement of a commercial warehouse at 83–87 Summer Street. The fire was finally contained 12 hours later, after it had consumed about of Boston's downtown, 776 buildings and much of the financial district, and caused $73.5 million in damage (equivalent to $ billion in ). The destruction to the buildings was valued at $13.5 million and the personal property loss was valued at $60 million. Despite these devastations, only thirteen people died in the inferno, including two Boston firemen. Underlying causes Franklin St. before and after the Great Boston Fire of 1872  Building practices  In 1872, there was no strictly enforced building code in Boston. The streets were narrow and the buildings were close together. Many of the buildings were too tall for fire ladders to reach the upper levels, and the pressure from the fire hoses was often insufficient to extinguish flames on the roofs of the buildings. Thus, the fire could spread from rooftop to rooftop, and across narrow streets. Many of the affected buildings were made of brick and stone, but with wooden framing. Also, wooden mansard roofs were a common architectural trend of the time period. The steep pitch of a mansard roof allows for more storage in the upper levels of a building. However, these roofs are flammable due to their wooden construction. Additionally, the warehouses of downtown Boston commonly stored dry materials in the eaves of the roofs, increasing the flammability. Merchandise stored in the attics of warehouses was not considered taxable inventory.  Insurance  Building owners in Boston had few incentives to implement fire-safety measures. Buildings were often insured above value or at full value. Arson to gain insurance money was not uncommon.  Fire alarm boxes  A fire alarm box in San Francisco, CA In 1852, Boston became the first city in the world to install telegraph-based fire alarm boxes. The boxes served as a fire warning system. If the lever inside of the alarm box was pulled, the fire department was notified, and the alarm could be traced back to the box via a coordinate system so that firefighters were dispatched to the correct location. All of the fire alarm boxes were kept locked from the system's installation in 1852 until after the Great Fire of 1872 to prevent false alarms. A few citizens in each area of Boston were given a key to the boxes, and all other citizens had to report fires to the key-holders who could then alert the fire department. In 1872, witnesses watched the fire spread before the key-holder of the area was located and able to unlock the alarm box to alert the Boston Fire Department. Twenty minutes after the fire was first noticed, firefighters arrived on the scene.  Water infrastructure  John Damrell, Boston Fire Department's chief engineer at the time, had told Boston officials that the existing water infrastructure was inadequate. He was told not to \\"magnify the needs of his department\\" after requesting funding for water infrastructure repairs. The existing water main pipelines were old and leaky, causing the pressure in the pipes to be lower than acceptable. The lack of pressure was so severe that the pipes could not produce enough force to reach the top floors and roofs of newer buildings. The number of hydrants throughout the city was insufficient to adequately cover the surrounding buildings. As the fire spread, firefighters struggled to find hydrants with adequate water pressure. Additionally, the fire hydrant couplings were not standardized within Boston making it more difficult for firefighters to connect their hoses and related equipment.  Horse sickness  Horses were used by the Boston fire department to pull fire engines, hoses, and ladders. At the time of the 1872 fire in early November, the northeast United States was experiencing an epizootic flu that affected and weakened the horses. When Damrell heard of the horse sickness he preemptively hired an additional 500 men to replace the horsepower that would typically haul the engines and other equipment to the sites of fires. After the fire, the city commission in charge of investigating the fire concluded that the response time of the fire department was only delayed by a few minutes in the absence of the horses.  Similarities to Great Chicago Fire  In 1871, Chicago suffered massive destruction and an estimated 300 casualties due to a massive fire. Damrell, along with fire chiefs from various large cities, traveled to Chicago after the fire in an attempt to learn from the city’s mistakes. Like Boston, Chicago buildings were made primarily of wood and building codes were not enforced, making the densely developed neighborhoods susceptible to fire. General Phil Sheridan, in charge of military relief in Chicago post-fire, did not condemn the city's use of gunpowder to blow up buildings to create firebreaks. In theory, a firebreak creates a gap in flammable material that serves as a barrier where the fire will run out of \\"fuel\\" to spread any further. However, many fire chiefs from Southern cities were firmly opposed to gunpowder-created firebreaks after having seen the destruction they caused in the Civil War. Damrell returned to Boston and continued to request funding for improved water infrastructure and fire equipment. Events of the fire Experts have deduced that the fire began in the basement of a warehouse on the corner Kingston Street and Summer Street, at approximately 83-85 Summer Street. In this particular area, most of the buildings were dedicated to retail or used as warehouses. The warehouse that first caught fire housed dry goods. From the basement, the flames spread to the wooden elevator shaft in the center of the building and moved up the floors, fueled by the flammable fabrics in storage. Finally, the building’s wooden mansard roof caught on fire and the flames were able to spread from rooftop to rooftop down the street. The heat was so powerful that granite buildings exploded. The fire spread through most of Boston's financial district which became known as the \\"burnt district.\\" The glow of the fire was noted in ships' logs by sailors off the coast of Maine.

The first fire engine to arrive was Engine Co. 7 from a station at 7 East Street. The first water on the fire came from Hose Company 2 of Hudson Street. By 8 pm, all of Boston's twenty-one engine companies were fighting the fire. Telegraphs were sent to surrounding towns requesting help, but the messages were delayed due to most telegraph offices already having closed for the night. Eventually, support arrived from fire departments in every state of New England, except Vermont. Of these were two Amoskeag Steamers from Manchester, New Hampshire. One was the first Amoskeag ever constructed (serial number 1), owned by the Manchester Fire Department; the other was the first self-propelled Amoskeag that the manufacturer sent down. Boston purchased the self-propelled steamer after the fire, impressed with its performance. The self-propelled steamer was the first one in use in the country.  Crowd control  During the fire, the narrow streets of Boston were packed with firefighters and their equipment as well as crowds of people. As building owners raced to retrieve valuables from their burning properties, looters ran in after them to collect whatever was left behind. Because the affected area was mostly commercial and not residential, spectators came from residential neighborhoods to watch the fire spread. Some historians estimate that over 100,000 bystanders watched the fire spread. The firefighters had to both extinguish the flames and keep people back from danger.  Gas lines  Gas supply lines connected to street lamps and used for lighting in buildings could not be shut off promptly. The gas still running through the lines served as fuel to the fire. Many of Boston's gas lines exploded due to the fire.  Use of explosives  As the fire spread, citizens asked Mayor William Gaston to authorize the use of gunpowder to blow up buildings in the path of the fire to create a firebreak. Mayor Gaston approved the creation of firebreaks and groups of citizens began packing buildings with gunpowder kegs. However, the firebreaks were not effective. Instead, they caused injury to the citizens involved and the flaming debris from the exploded buildings spread to surrounding buildings. Eventually, Damrell had to force citizens to stop using gunpowder. Old South Meeting House  Conclusion  Citizens and firefighters alike worked to stop the fire. Along Washington Street, wet blankets and rugs were said to have been used to cover buildings to prevent the fire from spreading to the Old South Meeting House, the church in which the Boston Tea Party was planned. Some citizens and firefighters climbed to the roof of the meeting house to put out sparks. Most accounts of the fire credit the Kearsarge Engine 3 of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with saving Old South Meeting House. The efforts to save this historic landmark finally halted the fire at the corner of Washington and Milk Streets, around midday on November 10.

Rebuilding  Following the fire, a citizen-formed committee urged Boston to restructure the layout of roadways in the damaged areas. Boston officials approved of this proposal, and many downtown streets were re-established to be wider and straighter. Most notably, Congress Street, Federal Street, Purchase Street, and Hawley Street were widened. The restructuring allotted space to establish Post Office Square at the intersection of Milk, Congress, Pearl, and Water Streets. Some of the rubble from destroyed buildings was moved into the harbor to expand Atlantic Avenue. Because over-insurance of buildings was common, many businesses had enough insurance money to begin rebuilding soon after the fire. In less than two years, Boston's financial district was rebuilt.  Economic effects  In the rebuilding that followed the fire, land values of the \\"burnt district\\" increased, according to a study in American Economic Review in 2017. The forced reconstruction of the financial district brought about widespread, simultaneous building upgrades and updates, and many properties were rebuilt to suit the commercial nature of the district. The widening of roads and re- assembly of land plots into larger parcels also contributed to the rise in land values. center  John Stanhope Damrell  A new committee, the Fire Commission was established to oversee the Boston Fire Department and investigate the fire of 1872. John Damrell resigned from his position as chief engineer in 1874 in the wake of the Fire Commission's investigation. He had served as chief engineer for eight years and worked as a professional firefighter in Boston since 1858. In 1874, Boston began replacing and repairing its water mains, one of Damrell's main causes during his career. Damrell continued his career in firefighting and public safety. In 1873, he founded the National Association of Fire Engineers (NAFE, now called the International Association of Fire Chiefs, IAFC) and became the organization's first president. He also served as a building inspector for the city of Boston.  Building code and inspection  While Damrell served as president of NAFE, the association published a list of eight fire safety concerns in building construction. # Flammable and combustible building materials # Excessive height buildings, beyond the reach of ground ladders # Fire escapes # Water supply # Space between buildings # Corridors and open stairways # Fire alarms # Fire department In 1877, Damrell was appointed Boston's building commissioner. He served the Department of Building Inspection for 25 years, until his son succeeded him. At the 20th Annual Convention of NAFE in 1892, Damrell is credited for Boston's formally established limits of building height and area. At the time, Boston was the only American city with these limitations. In 1884, Damrell petitioned the National Association of Fire Engineers to create a more formalized building code during his presentation of Building Code Report at a NAFE convention. In 1891, The National Association of Commissioners and Inspectors of Public Buildings (NACIPB) was established by Damrell, and he served as the first president. He served a second term as president when he was re-elected at the organization's annual conference in 1894. A standardized building code wasn't established until 1905, the year of Damrell's death, when the National Board of Fire Underwriters published its National Building Code.  Remembrance  At the corner of Kingston and Summer Streets, a plaque was installed by The Bostonian Society to mark the start of the fire. Old South Meeting House recognized the 138th anniversary of the fire in 2010 by displaying a partially-restored Kearsarge fire engine. Harvey W. Wiley took part in fighting the fire while he was a student at Harvard University. He later wrote about it in his autobiography. Author Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. watched the fire from his home on Beacon Hill. He wrote a poem about the event called \\"After the Fire\\".City ruins after the fire Image gallery File:1872 AfterFire Boston byJWBlack SmithsonianAmericanArt 1994.91.27 1a.jpgFile:1872 BostonFire byHaskell Allen NMAH2003-24860.jpgFile:View from Sturgis Street, by Kilburn Brothers.jpgFile:Bird's-eye view, from Robert N.

It was the ultimate development of the B-29 family, being over 50% heavier than its ancestor and had nearly double the range. Only two prototypes were built before the program was cancelled in favor of the Tupolev Tu-95 bomber which was much faster and had the same range. Development Neither the Tu-4 nor the Tupolev Tu-80 were true intercontinental strategic bombers as they both lacked the range to attack the United States from bases in the Soviet Union and return. The Tu-85 was designed to achieve the necessary range by use of more powerful and fuel-efficient engines, a redesigned wing to increase the lift/drag ratio and the addition of more fuel. A large number of engines were considered before settling on the Shvetsov ASh-2K, essentially two air-cooled ASh-82 radial engines paired together and the liquid-cooled Dobrynin VD-4K six-bank inline engine, similar in configuration to the failed German Junkers Jumo 222, for a format of engine/airframe proposed much earlier during World War II's later phases in late July 1943, for the Heinkel firm's Amerikabomber never-built contract contender. Both proposed engine designs for the Tu-85 were given turbochargers and power-recovery turbines which converted them into turbo-compound engines. The Shvetsov design was preferred, but was not yet mature enough for use, and the VD-4K was selected. A lot of effort was put into refining the design of the wing in collaboration with TsAGI. It had an aspect ratio of 11.745 and a taper of 2.93 for optimum lift at high- altitudes.Gordon, p. 115 The Tu-85 carried of fuel in 48 flexible tanks.Gunston, p. 146 Much of the armament and equipment was derived from those of the late-model Tu-4, including the four remotely-controlled dorsal and ventral turrets and the tail turret, each with two Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannon. But the Tu-85's tail turret had Argon ranging radar and each of the two bomb bays was enlarged to hold a FAB-9000 bomb. Actual design work began in August 1948 and was ratified by a directive from the Council of Ministers dated 16 September that required the first prototype to be ready for manufacturer's tests in December 1950. Construction of the first aircraft began in July 1950 and was completed in September.Gordon, p. 116 It first flew on 9 January 1951 and the manufacturer's tests lasted until October 1951. On 12 September the first prototype flew with a bombload of , landing with enough fuel remaining to have covered . The second prototype, sometimes referred to as the 85D () or 85/2, incorporated the lessons learned from the first aircraft, including revision and reinforcement of the airframe and a variety of changes to its equipment and systems. It was first flown on 28 June 1951 and its trials lasted until November 1951. Series production was approved on 23 March 1951 at three factories where it would succeed the Tu-4 on the production line, but this was reversed later in the year and the program was cancelled: during the Korean War Soviet MiG-15s brought down many US B-29 bombers, showing that there was no future for piston aircraft in combat use. Priority was given to the higher-performance turboprop Tu-95 'Bear', as its own turboprop powerplants, the TV-12 prototype series for the Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprops that power the Tu-95 to this day, were already generating 12,000 shp as early as 1951.Kuznetsov NK-12 (Russian Federation) – Jane's Aero- Engines Specifications (Tu-85/1) See also  References  Notes Bibliography  External links * Tu-85 by A.N.

It was cancelled in 1949 in favor of the Tupolev Tu-85 program which offered even more range. The sole prototype was used in various test programs before finally being used as a target. Development The Tu-80 was designed as a modernized and enlarged Tu-4 with greater range. This was to be achieved by the use of more fuel- efficient engines, better aerodynamics and added fuel tanks. It was intended to have a range of and carry a maximum bombload of with a top speed of . Work began on the design in February 1948 and this was confirmed by a Council of Ministers order of 12 June that required the prototype be ready for State acceptance trials in July 1949.Gordon, p. 112 The forward portion of the fuselage was redesigned with an airliner-style stepped windscreen and the fuselage was lengthened by almost which allowed the bomb bays and their doors to be lengthened. The radar and its operator were moved into the forward pressurized compartment and the radar itself was located in the \\"chin\\" position in a new streamlined fairing. The wings were enlarged to a total of and the rubber deicing boots were replaced by more efficient and aerodynamic bleed air deicers. The engine nacelles were redesigned with smaller cross- sections with less drag. Originally, Shvetsov ASh-2TK or Dobrynin VD-3TK engines were considered, but neither engine was ready so the Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN was used. Fully feathering propellers were also used. All of these changes increased the lift/drag ratio to 18 from the 17.0 of the Tu-4.Gordon, pp. 112–14 Construction of the Tu-80 began in November 1948, using as many Tu-4 components as possible to speed up construction, but the first flight was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 in favor of the Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing reversible-pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft.

The first Soviet military machine of this class, it was equipped with a rear fuselage loading ramp. It was not placed into production because the VVS decided it would be cheaper to modify its existing Tu-4s for the transport mission and to use its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 transports. Design and development The Tupolev OKB began work in September 1946 on a military transport version of the Tupolev Tu-70 airliner and this was confirmed by the Council of Ministers on 11 March 1947 with state trials to begin in August 1948. To expedite the process, maximum use was made of components of the Tu-70. Its engines were the uprated Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version. A new, narrower fuselage was designed, which included a rear cargo hatch, a vehicle loading ramp and paratroop exit doors. Three gun turrets (dorsal, ventral and tail), were to be adapted from the Tu-4, although they were not fitted on the prototype. It had a crew of six (two pilots, three gunners, a radio operator, and a navigator). The aircraft was intended for three different roles; transport, parachute transport and aerial ambulance. In the first role it was designed to carry two ASU-76 assault guns, two STZ NATI artillery tractors, six or seven GAZ-67B jeeps or five guns without their prime movers or any combination of equipment up to . To facilitate the loading of cargo, a winch was mounted on the ceiling of the cargo hold with a capacity of .

As an aerial ambulance it could carry 31 stretchers and four medical attendants.Gordon and Rigamant, p. 108 Operational history Construction of the first prototype was quite prolonged; the aircraft was not finished until November 1949, with its first flight taking place on 21 January 1950. It finished its manufacturer's trials the following May, but Tupolev decided not to submit it for the State acceptance trials as the Soviet Air Force had already decided that it would be cheaper to rely on its existing transports and to modify Tu-4 bombers for the cargo role. The prototype was used by the MAP ( – Ministry of Aviation Industry) until it crashed in October 1954.Gordon and Rigamant, p. 109 Specifications See also References Notes Bibliography  Tu-0075 Category:1950s Soviet military transport aircraft Category:Four- engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Abandoned military aircraft projects of the Soviet Union Tu-75 Category:Aircraft first flown in 1950 Category:Four-engined piston aircraft ","title":"Tupolev Tu-75"},{"id":"563700","text":"Newgrounds is an American online entertainment website and company. It hosts user-generated content such as gaming, filming, audio and artwork composition in four respective website categories. Newgrounds provides visitor-driven voting and ranking of user-generated submissions. The site's owner, Tom Fulp, founded the site and company in 1995 and produces in-house content over at the headquarters and offices, based in the Glenside neighborhood of Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania. Newgrounds's slogan since 2006 is \\"Everything, By Everyone\\". Newgrounds's slogan from 1995 to 2006 was \\"The Problems Of The Future, Today!\\" Time ranked the website at number 39 on its \\"50 Best Websites\\" list in 2010. Layout and overview Content and general alt= User- generated content can be uploaded and categorized into either one of the site's four web portals: Games, Movies, Audio, and Art. A Movie or Games submission entered undergoes the process termed Judgment, where it can be rated by all users (from 0 to 5 stars) and reviewed by other users. The average score calculated at various points during Judgment determine if whether the content will be \\"saved\\" (added onto the database) or \\"blammed\\" (deleted, with only its reviews saved in the Obituaries section). Art and audio compositions are processed using a different method called \\"Scouting\\". All users can put art and audio onto their own page, but only those that are \\"scouted\\" will appear in the public area. Like the Judgment system, it stops stolen content, spam, or prohibited material reaching the public area, using users and site moderators (referred to as \\"Mods\\") . Once an individual is scouted they are given the privilege to also scout others to those Portals. Since showing animated movies and games was the original purpose and they are still the dominant media of the site, those submissions are all displayed in an area just called the \\"Portal\\". This displays not only what is in Judgment, but it also displays the statuses of recently judged submissions, and various winners and most popular submissions. Content and context are liable to be reported for review to the Mods and staff members by flagging it for violations to the site's guidelines; a weighted system recognises experienced users and gives their flag more voice. The Homepage of Newgrounds includes featured submissions from each category, as well as awards and honors to users whose submission that fall under the site's requirements to earn them. All submissions have a rating. Adult-oriented content is allowed with adult ads, but is supposedly restricted only to users aged 18 and up, though there is no safeguard to assure this. Online competitions and contests are open at some times, where an individual can win and receive prizes presented by either a recognized user or staff member upon following a given theme. Pictured here is a depiction of members of the Clock Crew, a small group on Newgrounds User communication and behavior The site includes a Community portal, where users are able to communicate with others through various Internet forums. Threads in the forums can be locked if they are in violation of forum rules. Another communication system developed on the site, termed \\"Private Messaging\\" and abbreviated as PM, is also granted, similar to the service of email where users can send messages via the site to other users. A live chat room is also available. Any user breaking the rules of site use anywhere on the site can be sent warnings or subjected to sanctions, such as restrictions of membership or banning, by the Moderators or Staff. History 1990s: organization In 1991, at the age 13, Tom Fulp launched a Neo Geo fanzine under the name \\"New Ground\\" sending issues to approximately 100 members of a club originating on the internet in Prodigy. Fulp launched a website as New Ground Remix using a hosting service, increasing popularity in the summer of 1996 after BBS games Club a Seal and Assassin were created by Fulp while a student at Drexel University, Pennsylvania. Fulp created the sequels to his creations, as games Club a Seal II and Assassin II, along with the decision to develop a separate hosting site, titled as New Ground Atomix. Tom Fulp (pictured in 2007) is the creator of Newgrounds. Fulp began experimenting with Macromedia Flash, along with programming a Flash-compatible homepage that was later introduced to his secondary site, \\"Telebubby Fun Land\\", and was later released. Fulp later merged his two websites to form another website with the name Newgrounds, leading to him to change hosts to accommodate the increasing traffic, and started selling merchandise to pay for the website's hosting bills. Introducing banner ads to pay for growing payments in 1999, Fulp partnered with Troma, who hosted the site in exchange for a share of ad revenue. A chat room and message board was added onto the website, which allowed people visiting the website to interact with each other. Many users had begun submitting their own Flash creations to Fulp, so he created a portion of the site called \\"The Portal\\" to display them. A friend of Fulp's named Ross developed the \\"Grounds Gold System\\", which allowed users to gain points for voting on submissions online. Ad revenue had increased, so Ross was hired, starting development of the current automated Portal, which would allow users to submit their own generated content to the website and have it judged by anyone visiting. 2000s: Developments After the dot-com bubble collapsed, Newgrounds struggled in paying its hosting costs. The affiliation with Troma ended in 2003 and Newgrounds switched to another bandwidth provider, which significantly reduced hosting costs. 2004 saw Newgrounds recovering from the online market crash, and the Numa Numa Dance viral phenomenon made its debut on Newgrounds near the end of the year, and became one of the first viral videos on the internet. Medals, the equivalent of in-game achievements, were introduced for the first time through the API software in 2009, soon followed by a \\"Sharing\\" component that would allow content to be distributed within games, such as custom level designs. The Art Portal in its complete form was launched in June of the same year, along with the renovation of the company's headquarters. In later 2009, Fulp raised the file limit of Newgrounds to allow Mark Haynes to upload the eighth episode of his web series Super Mario Bros. Z, of which Fulp was a fan. 2010–present: Financial concerns, copyrights, and format changes In 2011, the Newgrounds Annual Tournament of Animation (NATA) began as a 4–6 month long animation competition on Newgrounds sponsored by Adobe. In 2012, Newgrounds published their first mobile game, titled GroundCats, on iOS. That same year, major changes to the website included the launch of the video player, allowing users to publish movies that were not in .SWF format for the first time, and support for HTML5-coded games, which meant users were no longer limited to submitting movies and games made in Flash. In 2013, the site suffered heavily through financial issues and closed down its online merchandise market the year after. Platform mobile game Geometry Dash developed by RobTop Games allowed songs from Newgrounds to be used in levels made with the level editor with the release of its 1.9 update in 2014. The Audio Portal consisted of submitted copyrighted songs for use in the game, leading to nightcore, along with mashups, banned as a result. The issue of copyright protection came to a head in 2016, when the site received a serious challenge to deal with the content and files containing unlicensed commercial music and images, resulting in many submissions being removed by moderators and staff. In 2018, new servers and video-encoding-software were unveiled, along with developments for the site to be ad-free, and improve page performance. In November and December 2018, Newgrounds experienced surges of new members originally from Tumblr, when that site began restricting adult content after illegal child pornography was found on that service, resulting in its iOS app being removed from Apple's App Store. In the wake of the Adobe Flash Player no longer being supported after the end of 2020, Newgrounds developed the Newgrounds Player as an alternate media player to continue viewing old Flash projects. Newgrounds also introduced support for HTML5-based games and animations as an alternative to Flash, which can be uploaded in the form of a .zip file.

It used a number of components from Boeing B-29s that had made emergency landings in the Soviet Union after bombing Japan. It had the first pressurized fuselage in the Soviet Union and first flew on 27 November 1946.Gordon, p. 105 The aircraft was successfully tested, recommended for serial production, but ultimately not produced because of more pressing military orders and because Aeroflot had no requirement for such an aircraft. Design and development After basic design work was completed on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided to design a passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, as it was to be known, would be made after testing. To speed up construction of the prototype, a number of components were utilized from two B-29s. These included the outer wing panels, the engine cowlings, the flaps, the undercarriage, the tail assembly and some of the internal equipment. The wing center section was redesigned and its span increased. The pressurized fuselage was entirely new and changed the wing's position from mid-wing to low-wing. The aircraft's cockpit windscreen was changed to a more conventional \\"stepped\\" configuration. Three different configurations were proposed for the cabin layout, a government VIP version, a mixed-class 40–48 passenger model and an airliner configuration with 72 seats. The prototype appears to have been built in the mixed-class configuration, but that cannot be confirmed.Gordon, pp. 105–06 The Tu-70 was completed in October 1946, but did not make its first flight until 27 November. It began manufacturer's trials in October, but an engine fire on the fourth flight caused it to make a crash-landing. This was traced to a design defect in the American-built supercharger-control system, but identifying the problem and fixing it prolonged the manufacturer's trials through October 1947. It was redesignated as the Tu-70 when it went through the State acceptance trials which ended on 14 December. It met all the design goals, but was not accepted for production as all the factories were already committed to building aircraft with a higher priority and Aeroflot had no requirement for the type, being fully satisfied with its existing Ilyushin Il-12 airliners.Gordon, pp. 106–07 It was sent to the NII VVS ( – Scientific- Research Institute of the Air Forces) for evaluation as a military transport aircraft in December 1951. It was used afterwards for a variety of tests before being scrapped in 1954. Its design was modified to a military transport as the Tupolev Tu-75, but this was also not placed into production.Gordon, p. 107 Specifications  300px See also References Notes Bibliography  * Tu-0070 Category:1940s Soviet airliners Category:Abandoned civil aircraft projects Category:Soviet Union–United States relations Category:Four-engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Tu-70 Category:Aircraft first flown in 1946 Category:Four-engined piston aircraft ","title":"Tupolev Tu-70"},{"id":"563713","text":"Mac Classic may refer to: * Macintosh Classic, a model of Macintosh computer * Classic Environment, a compatibility layer for Mac OS 9 included in Mac OS X * Classic Mac OS, versions of Mac OS before Mac OS X ","title":"Mac Classic"},{"id":"563719","text":"\\"Fly Me to the Moon\\", originally titled \\"In Other Words\\", is a song written in 1954 by Bart Howard. Kaye Ballard made the first recording of the song the year it was written. Frank Sinatra's 1964 version was closely associated with the Apollo missions to the Moon. In 1999, the Songwriters Hall of Fame honored \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" by inducting it as a \\"Towering Song\\". Background and composition In 1954, when he began to write the song that became \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\", Bart Howard had been pursuing a career in music for over 20 years. He played piano to accompany cabaret singers, but also wrote songs with Cole Porter, his idol, in mind. In response to a publisher's request for a simpler song, Bart Howard wrote a cabaret balladWill Friedwald, Sinatra! The Song Is You: A Singer's Art, Scribner, New York, 1995, page 411 which he titled \\"In Other Words\\". A publisher tried to make him change some words from \\"fly me to the Moon\\" to \\"take me to the Moon,\\" but Howard refused. Many years later Howard commented that \\"... it took me 20 years to find out how to write a song in 20 minutes.\\" He used his position as a piano accompanist and presenter at the Blue Angel cabaret venue to promote the song, and it was soon introduced in cabaret performances by Felicia Sanders. The song was composed in 3/4 time signature but was changed to 4/4 by Quincy Jones in his arrangement. Early recordings Kaye Ballard circa late 1950s Kaye Ballard made the song's first commercial recording, released by Decca in April 1954. A brief review published on May 8, 1954 in Billboard said that \\"In Other Words\\" was \\"...a love song sung with feeling by Miss Ballard.\\" This recording was released as the flipside of \\"Lazy Afternoon\\", which Kaye Ballard was currently performing as star of the stage show The Golden Apple.Liz Smith, Liner Notes for the CD Portia Nelson, Let Me Love You: Portia Nelson Sings the Songs of Bart Howard, DRG 91442, 1995 Over the next few years, jazz and cabaret singers released cover versions of \\"In Other Words\\" on EP or LP record albums, including Chris Connor, Johnny Mathis, Portia Nelson, and Nancy Wilson. Eydie Gormé sang the song on her 1958 album Eydie In Love, which reached #20 in the Cashbox Album Charts and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Fly Me to the Moon In 1960, Peggy Lee released the song on the album Pretty Eyes, then made it more popular when she performed it in front of a large television audience on The Ed Sullivan Show. As the song's popularity increased, it became better known as \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\", and in 1963 Peggy Lee convinced Bart Howard to make the name change official. Connie Francis released two non-English versions of the song in 1963: in Italian as \\"Portami Con Te\\" and in Spanish as \\"Llévame a la Luna\\".

Paul Anka released a version of \\"Fly Me To The Moon\\" in 1963. Frank Sinatra included the song on his 1964 album It Might as Well Be Swing, accompanied by Count Basie. The music for this album was arranged by Quincy Jones, who had worked with Count Basie a year earlier on the album This Time by Basie, which also included a version of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\". Will Friedwald commented that \\"Jones boosted the tempo and put it into an even four/four\\" for Basie's version, but \\"when Sinatra decided to address it with the Basie/Jones combination they recharged it into a straight swinger... [which]...all but explodes with energy\\". Bart Howard estimated that by the time Frank Sinatra covered the song in 1964, more than 100 other versions had been recorded. Bobby Womack recorded a version that was released in 1968 on Minit Records, from his album Fly Me to the Moon. His rendition reached #52 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #16 on the R&B; chart. Occasionally during the CBS-TV series WKRP, an instrumental sampling of \\"Fly Me To The Moon\\" was used as a doorbell melody during scenes taking place in the apartment of character Jennifer Marlowe. By 1995, the song had been recorded more than 300 times. The Japanese animated series Neon Genesis Evangelion uses several versions of the song sung by Claire Littley, Yoko Takahashi, and various female cast members of the series for the closing music of each episode; the song was removed from the 2019 Netflix re-release in most regions due to licensing issues, much to the dismay of fans. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic a 6-year-old girl in China named Miumiu made national news when her home video of the song was found and edited by a group of Italian musicians led by Bruno Zucchetti, who added an instrumental accompaniment performed from their homes during lockdown. NASA association Quincy Jones presents platinum copies of Frank Sinatra's album to Senator John Glenn and Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong Frank Sinatra's 1964 recording of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" became closely associated with NASA's Apollo space program. A copy of the song was played on a Sony TC-50 portable cassette player on the Apollo 10 mission which orbited the Moon, and also on Apollo 11 before the first landing on the Moon.Music on the Moon: Meet Mickey Kapp, Master of Apollo 11’s Astro-Mixtapes The song's association with Apollo 11 was reprised many years later when Diana Krall sang it at the mission's 40th anniversary commemoration ceremony, and also for mission commander Neil Armstrong's memorial service in 2012. The Sinatra version was also used in the 2000 NASA related fictional film Space Cowboys.

The Visigothic Code (; , Book of the Judges), also called Lex Visigothorum (English: Law of the Visigoths), is a set of laws first promulgated by king Chindasuinth (642–653 AD) of the Visigothic Kingdom in his second year of rule (642–643) that survives only in fragments. In 654 his son, king Recceswinth (649–672), published the enlarged law code, which was the first law code that applied equally to the conquering Goths and the general population, of which the majority had Roman roots, and had lived under Roman laws. The code abolished the old tradition of having different laws for Romans (leges romanae) and Visigoths (leges barbarorum), and under which all the subjects of the Visigothic kingdom would stop being romani and gothi instead becoming hispani. In this way, all subjects of the kingdom were gathered under the same jurisdiction, eliminating social and legal differences, and allowing greater assimilation of the populations. As such, the Code marks the transition from the Roman law to Germanic law and is one of the best surviving examples of leges barbarorum. It combines elements of the Roman law, Catholic law and Germanic tribal customary law. The first law codes During the first centuries of Visigothic rule, Romans were ruled by different laws than Goths were. The earliest known Visigothic laws are the Code of Euric, which were compiled by roughly 480 A.D. The first written laws of the Visigothic kingdom were compiled during the rule of king Alaric II and were meant to regulate the lives of Romans, who made up the majority of the kingdom and were based on the existing Roman imperial laws and their interpretations. The Breviarium (Breviary of Alaric) was promulgated during the meeting of Visigothic nobles in Toulouse on February 2, 506.Visigothic Spain 409 - 711 During the reign of king Leovigild an attempt was made to unite the laws regulating the lives of Goths and Romans into a revised law code, Codex Revisus. In 589, at the Third Council of Toledo, the ruling Visigoths and Suebi, who had been Arian Christians, accepted Roman Christianity (what became modern Catholicism). Now that the formerly Roman population and the Goths shared the same faith King Reccared issued laws that equally applied to both populations.Law and Society in the Visigothic Kingdom Visigothic code Fragment of an 11th-century Liber Judiciorum translation to the old Catalan language. Guarded at Santa Maria of Montserrat Abbey on the Montserrat mountain, Catalonia (Spain). The code of 654 was enlarged by the novel legislation of Recceswinth (for which reason it is sometimes called the Code of Recceswinth) and later kings Wamba, Erwig, Egica, and perhaps Wittiza. Recceswinth's code was edited by Braulio of Zaragoza, since Chindasuinth's original code had been hastily written and promulgated.King, 148-149. During the Twelfth Council of Toledo in 681, King Erwig asked that the law code be clarified and revised. Some new laws were added, out of which 28 dealt with Jews.Law and Society in the Visigothic Kingdom The laws were far-reaching and long in effect: in 10th-century Galicia, monastic charters make reference to the Code.Fletcher 1984, ch. 1, note 56 The laws govern and sanction family life and by extension political life: marriage, the transmission of property to heirs, safeguarding the rights of widows and orphans. Particularly with the Visigoth's Law Codes, women could inherit land and title, were allowed to manage land independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, could represent themselves and bear witness in court by age 14 and arrange for their own marriages by age 20.Klapisch-Zuber, Christine; A History of Women: Book II Silences of the Middle Ages, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England. 1992, 2000 (5th printing). Chapter 6, \\"Women in the Fifth to the Tenth Century\\" by Suzanne Fonay Wemple, pg 74. According to Wemple, Visigothic women of the Iberian Peninsula and the Aquitaine could inherit land and title and manage it independently of their husbands, and dispose of it as they saw fit if they had no heirs, and represent themselves in court, appear as witnesses (by the age of 14), and arrange their own marriages by the age of twenty The laws combined the Catholic Church's Canon law, and as such have a strongly theocratic tone. The code is known to have been preserved by the Moors, as Christians were permitted the use of their own laws, where they did not conflict with those of the conquerors, upon the regular payment of jizya tribute. Thus it may be presumed that it was the recognized legal authority of Christian magistrates while the Iberian Peninsula remained under Muslim control. When Ferdinand III of Castile took Córdoba in the thirteenth century, he ordered that the code be adopted and observed by his subjects, and had it translated, albeit inaccurately, into the Castilian language, as the Fuero Juzgo. The Catalan translation of this document, \\"Llibre Jutge\\", is among the oldest literary texts in that language (c. 1050). In 1910 an English translation of the code by Samuel Parsons Scott was published,The Visigothic Code (Forum Judicum(1910) available at http://libro.uca.edu/vcode/visigoths.htm but it received some severe criticism.See Timothy G.

(d/b/a AMC Theatres, originally an abbreviation for American Multi-Cinema; often referred to simply as AMC and known in some countries as AMC Cinemas or AMC Multi-Cinemas) is an American movie theater chain headquartered in Leawood, Kansas, and the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market ahead of Regal and Cinemark Theatres. After acquiring Odeon Cinemas, UCI Cinemas, and Carmike Cinemas in 2016, it became the largest movie theater chain in both the world and the United States. It has 2,200 screens in 244 theatres in Europe and over 8,200 screens in 661 theatres in the United States. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange; from 2012 to 2018, the Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group owned a majority stake in the company. Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners made a $600 million investment in AMC in September 2018, but the voting power of AMC shares is structured in such a way that Wanda Group still controls the majority of AMC's board of directors. As of March 18, 2020, all AMC theaters were temporarily closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the company reopened a majority of its theaters on August 20, 2020. As of July 28, 2020, AMC Theaters has also signed on \\"a multi-year deal\\" with Universal Pictures on releasing new films on VOD streaming after three weekends. History AMC Theatres was founded in 1920 by Maurice, Edward, and Barney Dubinsky, who had been traveling the Midwest performing melodramas and tent shows with actress Jeanne Eagels. They purchased the Regent Theatre on 12th Street between Walnut and Grand in downtown Kansas City, Missouri.The Dubinsky Brothers - Kansas City Public Library - Retrieved March 21, 2008 The Dubinskys eventually changed their name to Durwood, and the company they formed eventually became known as Durwood Theatres. In 1961, Edward's son Stanley H. Durwood took control of Durwood Theatres, then a small ten-theatre chain, when his father died. Stanley had attended Harvard University and served as a navigator in the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II. He renamed Durwood Theatres as American Royal Cinema on October 1, 1968. During the incorporation process, the name was changed to American Multi-Cinema, Inc., and Stanley began to apply military management and the insights of management science to revolutionize the movie theatre industry.La Franco, Robert. \\"Coming soon: a megaplex near you.\\" Forbes, August 12, 1996, p. 133. As he later explained to Variety magazine, \\"We needed to define what our company was doing in the (exhibition) business. My dad wasn't that organized.\\"\\"Durwood legacy packs 'em in.\\" Variety, March 16, 1998, p. 42. It was structured under the belief that every customer was a \\"guest\\". Under its new name, AMC Theatres opened the two-screen Parkway Twin theatre in a shopping center on Kansas City's Ward Parkway in 1963. This was the company's first foray into using the multiplex model. According to Variety, Stanley Durwood later claimed in 1962 that he \\"was standing in the lobby of his 600-seat Roxy in Kansas City mulling over its poor grosses, when he realized he could double his box office by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff.\\" The industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept, where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant increase in profits. The concept also provided more film choices at one location, drawing bigger crowds. It also gave owners the flexibility to show big hits on more screens, and less reliance on any individual film that could turn out to be a bust.Nan Robertson, \\"Multiplexes Add 2,300 Movie Screens in 5 Years\\"\\", The New York Times, November 7, 1983, C13.  Growth  AMC Empire 25 theatre in Times Square, New York City By the 1980s, the company was experiencing strong growth and in 1983 it had its initial public offering. AMC Theatres built it first multiplex overseas in 1985, the 10-screen multiplex at The Point, Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom, and later opened additional sites in the UK such as in Dudley and Tamworth, Staffordshire. In October 1988, they announced a joint venture with United Artists and Cinema International Corporation (a partnership of Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios), to run their combined cinemas in the UK, Ireland under the AMC name, however, AMC pulled out of the joint venture in December 1988, and sold their U.K. assets, including their 12 cinemas, to the new entity (later called United Cinemas International) for $98 million and withdrew from the UK market. In 1995, AMC Theatres pioneered the first North American megaplex, a theater that could accommodate thousands, when it opened the AMC Grand 24 in Dallas, Texas; the first megaplex in the world had been built by European chain Kinepolis in 1988. AMC continued to open other megaplex theaters, such as the AMC Hampton Towne Center 24 in Hampton, Virginia, and the chain's busiest theater in the US, the AMC Empire 25 in New York City near Times Square. On December 13, 1996, AMC opened the Ontario Mills 30, a 30-screen theater in Ontario, California, which at the time was the largest multiplex in the world. AMC Theatres' megaplex theatres were a success overseas as well. In April 1996, they opened Canal City 13 in Fukuoka, Japan which was followed on December 20, 1996, by the AMC Arrábida 20 in Porto, Portugal. In January 2002, the 16-screen Great Northern theatre was opened in Manchester in the U.K., which was later supplemented by the opening of a 12-screen cinema on the Broadway Plaza site in Birmingham in October 2003. AMC Theatres sometimes serve a dual function; in addition to the normal cinema functions, they also cater to companies' business conferences which can make use of their projectors for displaying presentations. In 2004, AMC Theatres was acquired by Marquee Holdings Inc., an investment vehicle controlled by affiliates of J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC, the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase, and Apollo Global Management, a private investment firm. At the time, AMC was publicly traded on AMEX under the code AEN. In 2006, the company announced a new initial public offering (IPO) expected to be worth approximately $789 million; however, adverse market conditions convinced the company's management to withdraw from such an offering on May 3, 2007. The company filed for a $450 million IPO in its third such filing since 2006 on July 14, 2010. Stanley Durwood died in 1999, and his successor was Peter Brown, the first non- Dubinsky/Durwood family member to head the company. Gerardo I. Lopez succeeded Brown as president and CEO of AMC Theatres on March 2, 2009. Previously, Lopez was the Executive Vice President of President Consumer Products Group, Seattle's Best Coffee, and Foodservice at Starbucks. Under new leadership, one of the first major announcements came in March of the same year; the company announced that it would equip 1,500 of its screens with Real D projectors. In the same month, AMC Theatres announced it had closed on a $315 million deal with Sony to replace all of its reel projectors with digital cinema projectors, starting in the second quarter of 2009 and completing in 2012. The company was formerly headquartered in downtown Kansas City. In September 2011, AMC Theatres announced plans to move its headquarters to a new $30 million four-story building designed by 360 Architecture in the Park Place development at 117th Street and Nall Avenue in Leawood, Kansas in suburban Kansas City. The state of Kansas had offered $47 million in incentives to get the 400 jobs to move. After reaching a settlement with the state of Illinois regarding complaints from a disability rights organization in April 2012, AMC pledged to equip all of its theaters in the state with captioning and description services by 2014. The disability rights group had accused the company of only providing closed captioning or audio description systems at some of its locations in the state.  Acquisition by Wanda Group (2012-present)  In May 2012, AMC Theatres was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, headquartered in Dalian, who paid $2.6 billion to acquire AMC's 5,048 screens in 347 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. The deal was finalized on September 4, 2012. The acquisition made Wanda the world's largest cinema chain. Wang Jianlin, CEO of Dalian Wanda Group, announced that the company would plan to spend $500 million renovating AMC locations. AMC Theatres had eight movie theatres in Canada. In July 2012, four locations were sold to Cineplex Entertainment, and two more locations were sold to Empire Theatres and later acquired by Landmark Cinemas. The two remaining locations have since closed. AMC Lakeline 9 in Austin, Texas Gerardo I. Lopez announced his resignation as CEO of AMC in August 2015. Craig Ramsey was appointed as the interim CEO by the company board. In December 2015, AMC announced that Adam Aron would be the company's president and chief executive officer, as well as a member of the company's board of directors, beginning on January 4, 2016. Aron will also be . In March 2016, AMC Theatres announced it would acquire competitor Carmike Cinemas. In July 2016, Carmike's management accepted a revised offer, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal was closed on December 25, 2016, making AMC the largest cinema chain in the United States. On March 1, 2017, AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron stated that the company would rebrand Carmike Cinemas locations under the AMC name; smaller locations were rebranded under the new banner AMC Classic (which repurposes trademarks associated with Carmike). Aron also announced a plan to rebrand its kitchen-equipped theaters as AMC Dine-In. In July 2017, AMC Theatres announced they would be cutting $30 million in expenses by the end of the year. This cost reduction would be accomplished by reducing operating hours, cutting staffing levels, and other measures. In September 2018, Silver Lake Partners made a $600 million investment in AMC Theatres, whose proceeds were used to repurchase approximately 32% of Wanda Group's class B common stock. However, the voting power of AMC's shares is structured in such a way that, even after reducing its ownership of AMC common stock to just under 50% by the end of 2019, Wanda Group continues to retain majority control over AMC's board of directors. In October 2019, AMC began to offer on-demand rentals and purchases of digital film releases under the banner AMC Theatres On Demand. The service is tied to the company's Stubs loyalty program.  Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  AMC Theatres Marquee in Connecticut On March 18, 2020, AMC announced the closure of all of its theaters due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in compliance with CDC guidance against any gathering of over ten people. AMC said this shutdown would last for at least six to twelve weeks. On March 25, 2020, AMC furloughed all of its 600 corporate employees, including CEO Adam Aron. All furloughed corporate AMC employees and associates retain their active employment status, including all health benefits. On April 28, 2020, AMC announced they would no longer carry films from Universal Pictures, following the studio's announced plans to release its films on demand simultaneously with theatrical releases. On June 3, 2020, AMC announced it had \\"substantial doubt\\" that it would remain in business after closing its theaters due to the pandemic. On June 18, 2020, AMC announced plans to resume operations in 450 of its US locations on August 20, 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to close its US venues for over five months. On July 28, 2020, AMC and Universal were able to resolve their dispute, with AMC agreeing to a shorter theatrical window of 17 days before Universal could release their films on demand. On August 20, 2020, AMC resumed theatre operations with offerings of $0.15 tickets. The company upgraded its air filtration systems to four times the rates before the pandemic and installed electrostatic sprayers in the auditoriums. In October 2020, the company announced that \\"existing cash resources would be largely depleted by the end of 2020 or early 2021.\\" Features AMC patented cup holder armrests in 1981. AMC also introduced stadium-style seating. The seats are placed on risers so that each person has an unobstructed view of the screen. In 1995, they introduced \\"Love Seat\\" style seating with retractable armrests so that there can be no barrier between two seats. These features have become standard for nearly all movie theaters built today by almost all major chains. In July 1994, AMC signed an agreement with Sony to begin installing Dolby Digital in auditoriums, and began upgrading selected older auditoriums in 2003. On March 26, 2009, AMC announced an agreement to convert 1,500 existing auditoriums to fully digital 3D screens using RealD technology. On March 30, they announced they would convert all 4,500 screens in their chain to 4K digital projectors provided by Sony. In competition with IMAX, AMC had begun its conversion at select locations to the Enhanced Theatre Experience (ETX), with the installation of AMC's ETX with Dolby Atmos in some locations. As of 2016, some of these ETX locations have become Dolby Cinema at AMC locations. Premium formats Selected AMC locations offer premium screens and features for a higher ticket price, including large-screen formats. Most theater locations are equipped to show 3D films in RealD 3D. *Dolby Cinema is a premium large format that features dual 4K laser projectors with Dolby Vision HDR, Dolby Atmos surround sound, and recliners with seat-mounted subwoofers. They also feature special entrance tunnels into the auditorium, with a video wall displaying content relating to the film being screened. Some Dolby Cinema screens were converted from the Prime and ETX formats. *IMAX auditoriums are available at many locations; IMAX digital projectors are used in most locations, with a few using traditional 70 mm analog projectors. * Prime at AMC auditoriums feature large screens with Dolby Atmos, and recliners with seat-mounted subwoofers. In 2015, AMC began to replace Prime with Dolby Cinema at some locations. *BigD is a large-screen format inherited from the Carmike Cinemas chain, which uses a 70-foot screen and stadium seating with retractable armrests. Defunct * ETX (Enhanced Theatre Experience) was a premium large format used in selected markets, which included larger screens, 12-channel surround sound, and digital projection (utilizing either Sony 4K projection or Christie DLP technology). Some auditoriums also included Dolby Atmos. In 2015, AMC began to replace ETX with Dolby Cinema. Non-film formats * Virtual Reality  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc invested $20 million in virtual-reality arcades and productions: $10 million to virtual reality entertainment company Dreamscape Immersive and another $10 million in a content fund.AMC Theaters Backs Virtual Reality With $20 Million Investment, Bloomberg, September 26, 2017 Guest loyalty programs AMC Theatres created the now-defunct MovieWatcher program that rewarded frequent movie-goers similar to other rewards programs but featured innovative aspects. It was based on a points-per-movie-ticket-purchased system, with rewards varying from concessions to movie passes based on point- based level. However, points were limited to a maximum of four points per three-hour time period, which was equal to two tickets. For those AMC cinemas which were not part of the Loews Cineplex acquisition, and therefore, ticketed by MovieTickets.com, the website's surcharge was waived for MovieWatcher members. On April 1, 2011, AMC started a new rewards program known as AMC Stubs, which could be purchased for a fee of $12 for an entire year. For that initial fee, members would receive $5 on every $50 spent between the box office and the concession stand at any AMC theater nationwide. AMC Stubs members also received a free size upgrade with every popcorn and drink they purchase (for example, an AMC Stubs member can get a large popcorn for the price of a regular). Other perks include birthday gifts and waived ticketing fees for online ticketing sites such as MovieTickets.com and Fandango and also online ticket purchases through AMC's own website and mobile app. Receipts or ticket stubs were required for manual adjustments. No more than four manual adjustments would be allowed per account in a single calendar month. Manual adjustments would be made for purchases made within 30 calendar days from date of original purchase. As of March 29, 2012, AMC Stubs had 3.2 million members, which represents approximately 18% of AMC attendance during fiscal 2012. In July 2018, AMC Stubs was split into three programs which are currently still in-place: the free AMC Stubs Insider; the yearly fee-based AMC Stubs Premiere, which costs $15 annually and provides the same benefits as the original Stubs plus an expedited line at tickets and concessions; and the monthly fee-based AMC Stubs A-List, which includes up to 3 movie tickets a week to any film in any format for $19.95 to $23.95 a month, depending on the state the member plans to watch movies in. Discount Tuesdays is another feature every Tuesday for members to purchase tickets typically for just $6 to any film in most locations, with occasional exclusions, plus surcharges for premium formats such as 3D, IMAX, and Dolby Cinema, as well as special events. MacGuffins Bar and Lounge Some AMC locations have a bar service under the MacGuffins brand. These are primarily offered at AMC and AMC Dine-in locations, but some AMC Classic locations with liquor licenses offer their alcoholic beverages under this brand. Drinks can be ordered to be drank in the bar and lounge area or taken into the theater. Some AMC Dine-in theaters have their MacGuffins set up as a full-service restaurant that can be accessed without having to pay for a movie ticket. Vouchers Several types of vouchers may be used at AMC Theatres. * Black And Yellow tickets  AMC sells Black and Yellow (formerly Red, Green, Gold, and Silver) tickets, typically priced from $8.50 to $10.25, that can be purchased in bulk at many retailers, like Costco and Sam's Club, as well as at AMC locations. Both can be redeemed towards any movie, but yellow tickets cannot be redeemed in the states of California, New York, and New Jersey. Regardless of the ticket used, surcharges apply for special presentations and premium formats such as RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX, among others. * Gift cards  AMC offers gift cards, which are sold at AMC theaters and by some retailers. They can be used to buy goods or services (such as tickets and food) both online and at AMC theaters. * Snack vouchers  AMC offers Show Snacks coupons. Some can be exchanged for a small popcorn, while others offer a small fountain drink. The chain also offers similar coupons via SMS or smartphone apps. Older coupons specially designed for the concession stand may be honored by AMC, at its discretion. Banners Following the acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, AMC began to unify its cinemas under one of three main banners in 2017: AMC only reflects this branding in the Theater name, with different in location signage, and with a different pre-show intro depending on how the location is branded. * AMC serves as the flagship banner, covering conventional cinemas with premium features and formats available. * AMC Classic is used for smaller, value-oriented cinemas with fewer premium amenities. The brand is primarily used by the former Carmike locations (also reusing Carmike's \\"folded film\\" logo and \\"America's Hometown Cinemas\\" trademarks). These locations will also use Orange window decals instead of the normal red to reflect the classic branding. * AMC Dine-In is used for cinemas that offer expanded food service, including auditoriums with reserved seating and table service Other endeavors AMC also formed a short-lived partnership with Planet Hollywood which failed due to that company's bankruptcy. The Planet Movies by AMC venture planned to open complexes worldwide with the objective of having icon locations in major metropolitan and other select areas, like Orlando and Columbus. Initially, seven existing, unnamed AMC megaplex theaters with more than 150 combined screens were to be re-branded under a license arrangement to incorporate certain elements of the new concept. The initial seven re-branded locations were to include markets such as Orlando, Florida. The AMC Pleasure Island 24 megaplex in Orlando, situated directly across from Planet Hollywood's most successful restaurant and retail unit and adjacent to Disney's Pleasure Island (now Disney Springs) was to be the first Planet Movies location. After the initial seven, the joint-venture planned to own and operate all subsequent units including 8 to 10 complexes with 200 to 250 screens planned to open over the next 18 to 24 months. Over the longer term, the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of 5 to 10 per year. From almost the very start, the well-publicized financial strains on Planet Hollywood hindered the project. The only Planet Movies location to actually open, a 30 screen megaplex, did so in the summer of 1999 at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio. The location was also located alongside an Official All Star Café and Planet Hollywood restaurant. The continued poor financial performance of Planet Hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in December 1998, and even before the first location had opened stated that \\"the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the Columbus site is completed\\". As Planet Hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in October 1999 their re-organization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from side- ventures like Planet Movies and their Cool Planet ice cream chain. The Planet Hollywood restaurant and All Star Café in Columbus were closed in late 2000, and the film memorabilia were also removed from the theater as it was rebranded AMC Easton 30, and continues to operate. The Planet Movies by AMC joint venture was formally dissolved on January 9, 2001. Both of the Disney Parks in the United States at one time included AMC movie theaters at their Downtown Disney sections: AMC Dine-In Disney Springs 24 all-stadium-seating megaplex with Dolby Cinema and Dine-In Theatres (opened in 1996) (formerly AMC Pleasure Island 24) at Walt Disney World Resort and AMC Downtown Disney 12 at Disneyland Resort stadium-seating multiplex (opened in 2001, closed in 2018). The AMC Citywalk Stadium 19 located on Universal Studios Hollywood's Citywalk was relaunched after a renovation as \\"Universal Cinema, an AMC Theatre\\", on April 21, 2017. This location includes a seven-story IMAX screen with IMAX Laser and IMAX 70mm film, as well as \\"Black Box\\"–inspired auditoriums. It has one Christie Laser Projector per auditorium, with Dolby Atmos speakers. At Universal Studios Florida, AMC had the Universal Cineplex 20 (also a former Cineplex Odeon), until September 2018 when it became a Cinemark. AMC Independent (also known as AMCi) is an AMC film distribution program that aims to help independent films reach a theatrical audience. The program was announced in 2010 via the AMC Blog, and has been responsible for promoting and distributing all independent films to AMC theaters since. Acquisitions The Loews Alderwood 16 in Lynnwood, Washington had opened in March 2005 before the merger with AMC AMC has acquired multiple other theater chains throughout its history, resulting in a total of 385 theaters with 5,128 screens in six countries: In March 2002, AMC bought General Cinema Corporation, which added 66 theaters with 621 screens to the company assets, as well as Gulf States Theaters, which had five theaters with 68 screens in the greater New Orleans area. In late 2003, AMC acquired MegaStar Theatres, adding additional theaters in the Atlanta and Minneapolis–St. Paul markets. On January 26, 2006, AMC merged with Loews Cineplex Entertainment to form AMC Entertainment; the deal brought into AMC's fold the entire Loews and American Cineplex chains, along with Magic Theatres (named after NBA player Magic Johnson) and Star Theatres, based in Metro Detroit. In 2010, AMC acquired Chicago-based Kerasotes Showplace Theatres, LLC for $275 million, combining the nation's second and sixth largest movie theater chains, except for the Showplace 14 in New Jersey and the Showplace ICON theatres.AMC Entertainment and Kerasotes Theatres Announce Entry Into Definitive Agreement , AMC Entertainment, January 19, 2010Kerasotes Plans Sale of Theatres to AMC, NWI.com, January 22, 2010AMC Theatres and Kerasotes Theatres Announce Completion of Sale , AMC Entertainment, May 25, 2010AMC Closes on $275 Million Purchase of Kerasoets Theater Chain, Kansas City Business Journal, May 25, 2010 In December 2015, Starplex Cinemas was sold to AMC for approximately $175 million. Most of these theaters now operate as AMC Classic as of July 2017. On March 3, 2016, AMC announced its intent to acquire Carmike Cinemas in a $1.1 billion deal, pending regulatory and shareholder approval, which would allow it to overtake Regal as the United States' largest movie theater chain. The merger officially closed in December 2016. In July 2016, UCI & Odeon Cinema Group was sold to AMC for approximately $1.21 billion, subject to European Commission approval. The acquisition was approved by the European Commission and the deal closed in November 2016. In January 2017, Nordic Cinema Group, the leading movie theater operator in the Nordic and Baltic area, was sold to AMC for approximately $929 million. The deal was completed in March 2017 after AMC received clearance from the European Commission. Controversies The early versions of stadium- style seating as built in 1995 had auditoria configured with an entrance to a flat area in front of the screen for wheelchair users; people sitting there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen. Able-bodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable line-of-sight with the screen. Since some wheelchair users may have limited neck movement range, this configuration made AMC a popular target for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) lawsuits. AMC subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building full-stadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal line-of-sight. However, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the company, and obtained an order requiring AMC to retrofit over 1,990 screens in 95 multiplexes and megaplexes across the United States. The company successfully appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled on December 5, 2008 that the order was excessive and violated AMC's due process rights under the Constitution of the United States. AMC won by pointing out that the United States Access Board had not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require them to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers, versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen. Therefore the court ruled that it was unfair to AMC to retroactively hold it to a standard which did not exist at the time it began building stadium-style theaters. When AMC announced that most of their theaters would reopen in mid- July 2020, the initial announcement said masks would be recommended but not mandatory. AMC CEO Adam Aron stated, \\"We are strongly encouraging our guests to wear masks all across the country, but not requiring it\\" and \\"We did not want to be drawn into a political controversy . . . We thought it might be counterproductive if we forced mask wearing on those people who believe strongly that it is not necessary.\\" After massive pushback from the public, Aron changed the policy to require masks: \\"This announcement prompted an intense and immediate outcry from our customers, and it is clear from this response that we did not go far enough on the usage of masks,\\" Aron said.

He is best known for his \\"Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey\\", a large body of surrealistic one-liner jokes, as well as his \\"Fuzzy Memories\\" and \\"My Big Thick Novel\\" shorts, and for his deadpan delivery. Although many people assume otherwise, Handey is a real person, not a pen name or character. Career Handey's earliest writing job was for a newspaper, the San Antonio Express-News. He lost the job after writing an article that, in his words, \\"offended local car dealerships\\". His first comic writing was with comedian Steve Martin. According to Martin, Handey got a job writing for Saturday Night Live after Martin introduced Handey to the show's creator, Lorne Michaels. For several years Handey worked on other television projects: the Canadian sketch series Bizarre in 1980; the 1980 Steve Martin television special Comedy Is Not Pretty!; and Lorne Michaels' short-lived sketch show on NBC called The New Show in 1984. Handey returned to Saturday Night Live in 1985 as a writer. Deep Thoughts In April 1984, National Lampoon published the first of Jack Handey's Deep Thoughts. Additional Deep Thoughts appeared in the October and November 1984 editions as well as in the short-lived comedy magazine Army Man, while more appeared in 1988 in The Santa Fe New Mexican. The one-liners were to become Handey's signature work, notable for their concise humor and their outlandish hypothetical situations. For example: *If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason. *The crows seemed to be calling his name, thought Caw. Handey's work next showed up in the Michael Nesmith-produced TV series Television Parts in the format which later became famous on Saturday Night Live (though in Television Parts, Nesmith provided the narration). Some of these segments appeared in the compilation video of that program, Doctor Duck's Super Secret All-Purpose Sauce. Between 1989 and 1990, Deep Thoughts were shown during commercial breaks on The Comedy Channel with Handey's narration. Between 1991 and 1998, Saturday Night Live included Deep Thoughts on the show as an interstitial segment (between sketches). Introduced by Phil Hartman and read live by Handey (neither actually appeared on screen), the one-liners proved to be extremely popular. Hartman intoned \\"And now, Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey...\\", and peaceful easy listening music played while the screen showed soothing pastoral scenes, much like a New Age relaxation video. Handey then read the Deep Thought as the text to it scrolled across the screen. They became an enduring feature of SNL, which often had multiple Thoughts in each episode, and made Handey a well-known name. Other SNL work Other Handey creations that appeared on SNL include the Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, \\"Fuzzy Memories\\" which depicted reenactments of a twisted childhood memory and aired in the late 1990s, and the short-lived \\"My Big Thick Novel\\", which were spoken excerpts from a very long book in the style of \\"Deep Thoughts\\" and which aired during the 2001–03 seasons of SNL. Handey is also credited with creating Toonces the Driving Cat, the cat who could drive a car, although not very well.Carman, John (February 14, 1992). \\"We Paws for This Message\\", San Francisco Chronicle. The recurring skit originated in 1989 with Steve Martin and Victoria Jackson as the crash-prone kitten's owners. In 1992 NBC aired a half-hour Toonces special. Handey, who lived with a real cat by the same name, once said he could not remember exactly how he dreamed up the premise. He said, \\"It was just one of those free association ideas you write down and look at later and think, 'Maybe. Further writing In early April 2008, Handey published his first collection of magazine humor pieces, What I'd Say to the Martians and Other Veiled Threats. Associated Press critic Jake Coyle wrote, \\"With absurdist musings such as these, Handey has established himself as the strangest of birds: a famous comedian whose platform is not the stage or screen, but the page.\\" Handey subsequently became a regular contributor to The New Yorker Shouts and Murmurs section. On July 16, 2013 Handey's first novel, The Stench of Honolulu, was released with publisher Grand Central. Personal life Handey was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1949. His family later moved to El Paso, Texas, where Handey attended Eastwood High School (where he was editor of Sabre, the school newspaper) and the University of Texas at El Paso. Jack Handey lives with his wife, Marta Chavez Handey, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Previously, the Handeys had lived in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.

An audiometer is used to determine a person's hearing sensitivity at different frequencies. There are other hearing tests as well, e.g., Weber test and Rinne test. Ear examination Prior to the hearing test itself, the ears of the client are usually examined with an otoscope to make sure they are free of wax, that the eardrum is intact, the ears are not infected, and the middle ear is free of fluid (indicating middle ear infection). The most common reasons to develop hearing loss due to genetic disorder, ageing problems, exposure to noise pollution, infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins. Pure tone audiometry The standard and most common type of hearing test is pure tone audiometry, which measures the air and bone conduction thresholds for each ear in a set of 8 standard frequencies from 250Hz to 8000Hz. The test is conducted in a sound booth using either a pair of foam inserts or supraural headphones connected to an external audiometer. The result of the test is an audiogram diagram which plots a person's hearing sensitivity at the tested frequencies. On an audiogram an \\"x\\" plot represents the softest threshold heard at each specific frequency in the left ear, and an \\"o\\" plot represents the softest threshold heard at each specific frequency in the right ear. There is also a high frequency version of the test which tests frequencies over 8000Hz to 16000Hz which may be employed in special circumstances.  In-situ audiometry using mobile applications  The availability of stereo headphones and smartphones or tablets equipped with sound reproduction systems led to the appearance of new audiologic diagnostic methods which help people identify their degree of hearing loss without assistance. For users of these mobile devices, there are a number of applications available with a function for audiometric hearing testing. There are also hearing aid applications with a built-in hearing test for making hearing aid adjustments. In the process of hearing test with specialized applications, initial hearing thresholds of perception of tone signals on different frequencies (audiogram) are identified. Hearing thresholds, like with traditional audiometry, and with a special application, are determined on a standard set of frequencies from 125 Hz to 8 kHz. Also, an application can be integrated with a function for testing the relevance of perception of separate sounds and figures of intelligibility in various acoustic conditions Technically, the hearing test application consists of the following blocks: * program module-generator of tone signals of the required frequency; * graphic interface options (for fixing the user’s reaction to exceeding tone perception threshold); * interpreter of test results (text and graphics); * database with the results of previous examinations and hearing age norms parameters Hearing test results obtained through the application will be in error as compared to the results of hearing test conducted by an audiologist because of the following reasons: * the use of specialized calibrated equipment; * sound- proofing of the room where hearing test is held; * heterogeneity of parameters of sound-recording systems in smartphones and tablets, and also headphones or headsets; * noise masking effect of tone signals Advantages of the audiometry conducted with a specialized application or hearing aid application include availability and possibility to do the hearing test without assistance. Despite possible errors in the results of diagnostics, the undoubted advantages of hearing testing with a special application or hearing aid application include the ability to do the hearing test without assistance and the availability of hearing testing. Scientists suggest that the hearing test using a mobile application can be used to identify hearing pathologies and also for hearing screening tests. Weber and Rinne A complete hearing evaluation involves several other tests as well. In order to determine what kind of hearing loss is present, a bone conduction hearing test is administered. In this test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed behind the ear, on the mastoid process. When the patient can no longer feel/hear the vibration, the tuning fork is held in front of the ear; the patient should once more be able to hear a ringing sound. If they cannot, there is conductive hearing loss in that ear. Additionally, the tuning fork is placed on the forehead. The patient is then asked if the sound is localised in the centre of the head or whether it is louder in either ear. If there is conductive hearing loss, it is likely to be louder in the affected ear; if there is sensorineural hearing loss, it will be quieter in the affected ear. This test helps the audiologist determine whether the hearing loss is conductive (caused by problems in the outer or middle ear) or sensorineural (caused by problems in the cochlea, the sensory organ of hearing) or neural - caused by a problem in the auditory nerve or auditory pathways/cortex of the brain. Hearing in Noise The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) measures a person's ability to hear speech in quiet and in noise. In the test, the patient is required to repeat sentences both in a quiet environment and with competing noise being presented from different directions. More specifically, there are four conditions: (1) sentences with no competing noise, (2) sentences with competing noise presented directly in front of the patient, (3) noise presented at 90° to the right of the patient, and (4) noise presented at 90° to the left of the patient. The test measures signal to noise ratio for the different conditions which corresponds to how loud the sentences needed to be played above the noise so that the patient can repeat them correctly 50% of the time.  Words- in-Noise Test The Words-in-Noise Test (WIN) uses monosyllabic words presented at seven different signal to noise ratios with masking noise - typically speech spectrum noise. The WIN test will yield a score for a person's ability to understand speech in a noisy background. Unlike a pure- tone audiogram, the WIN test may provide a more functional test of a person's hearing in a situation that is likely to occur.  Modified Rhyme Test The Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) is defined in the American National Standard ANSI S3.2 Methods for Measuring the Intelligibility of Speech Over Communication Systems. The method consists of 50 sets of six monosyllabic words that differ in initial or final consonant (e.g. not, tot, got, pot, hot, lot or ray, raze, rate, rave, rake, race). The listener is typically presented with the on of the words in the couplet preceded by a phrase, \\"You will mark the word ___\\". The six words that rhyme are presented to the listener to select what they believe to be the correct answer. The MRT has been extensively used by the US Air Force to test the performance of different communication systems, which often include a noise interference component. If a condition achieves a score of 80% correct responses or better, then that is often an acceptable performance level. Other *The audiologist or hearing instrument specialist may also conduct speech tests, wherein the patient repeats the words he or she hears. *In addition, a test called a tympanogram is generally done. In this test, a small probe is placed in the ear and the air pressure in the ear canal is varied. This test tells the audiologist how well the eardrum and other structures in the middle ear are working. The ear canal volume indicates whether a perforation in the eardrum (tympanic membrane) may be present. The middle ear pressure indicates whether any fluid is present in the middle ear space (also called \\"glue ear\\" or \\"otitis media with effusion\\"). Compliance measurement indicates how well the eardrum and ossicles (the three ear bones) are moving. *The last test the audiologist may perform is an acoustic reflex test. In this test a probe is placed in the ear and a loud tone, greater than 70 dBSPL, is produced. The test measures the reflexive contraction of the stapedius muscle, which is important in protecting the ear from loud noises, such as a person's own speech which may be 90 dBSPL at the eardrum. This test can be used to give information about the vestibular and facial nerves and indicate if a lesion may be present.

It is approximately north-east of Canberra located adjacent to the Federal Highway en route to and Sydney. Lake George is also the name of a locality on the western and southern edges of the lake, within the area of the Queanbeyan–Palerang Regional Council. Geography and hydrology Lake George is an endorheic lake, as it has no outflow of water to rivers and oceans. The lake is believed to be more than a million years old. Originally, small streams drained its catchment into the Yass River, but then the Lake George Escarpment rose due to major crustal movement along a strong fault line, blocking this drainage and forming the lake. Lake George has in previous Ice Ages been much larger and deeper. The thickness of sediment beneath the lake exceeds , according to a Bureau of Mineral Resources Canberra drilling programme in the 1982/83 summer. The oldest sediments, which lie some distance above the bedrock, were dated at 4–5 million years using spore and pollen analysis and magnetic reversal stratigraphy. At long and wide, Lake George is long, largely flat and extremely shallow, with a very small catchment. Resultant evaporation rates as well as a tendency for strong winds to blow the water back on itself explain the mysterious filling and drying episodes on both short term (hours) and long term (years) time scales that have been observed. The lake's depth when full can range from ; however in many areas it is only around deep. Its deepest point has been measured as . When full, the lake holds about of water. Between the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the lake lapped the Federal Highway on its western edge. Lake George is one of the most studied lakes in Australia. The palaeontologist Patrick De Deckker has commented that \\"it is actually a depression that turns into a lake when it fills. There’s always water below the lake floor, and amazingly, it is saline, but if you have more rainfall, the lake fills up\\". Activities Zebra herd at the Floriade event Lake George is the site of an experimental scientific wave behaviour platform established by researchers from the Civil Engineering department of the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra. Lake George has been a popular fishery at times, after high water levels and stockings of fish. Since the 1960s hang gliders have been flown from the escarpment when easterly winds form standing waves. Pilots can then fly along the length of the lake. Unpowered model aircraft are also flown from this area, and powered models are flown from the lake floor. Wine grapes are grown along the western edge of the lake, on the escarpment. Sheep are grazed on the lake when it is dry or nearly so. Public art Lake George was an important subject for the Canberra artist, Rosalie Gascoigne (1917-1999) who told Kate Davidson in 1996 that she \\"was enraptured with the feeling of getting out of my car at the top of the range above Lake George and Gundaroo and seeing Australia stretch away under a big dome of sky. Nothing is there, but everything is there. It was very free and uncalculated. You cannot really express it in concrete terms, you have to be elusive and allusive at the same time.\\" (Davidson, Kate and Michael Desmond, Islands: Contemporary installations from Australia, Asia, Europe and America, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, 1996). Works inspired by Lake George include Pale landscape 1977 (Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington), Feathered fence 1978-79 and Suddenly the lake 1994-95 (both National Gallery of Australia), But mostly air 1994-95 (Art Gallery of South Australia) and Lake 1991 (Garangula Gallery NSW). Pale landscape 1977 and Feathered fence 1978-79 were both made with thousands of swans feathers found at a sanctuary at the southern end of the lake in the mid-1970s, the swans are no longer there since the lake dried up. In 2010, Canberra artists Alan and Julie Aston installed a herd of zebra sculptures on the lake adjacent to the highway stop commemorating Kevin \\"Dasher\\" Wheatley VC, used as a \\"Driver Reviver\\" site. They were named Stopper, Reviver, Survivor, and Dasher. They were a sensation, but the Government of New South Wales ordered that they be removed, following a complaint from the leaseholder of the land. They reappeared at Floriade in September 2010, along with a baby, George. History The local indigenous people called the lake Werriwa (originally spelled Weereewa in the journals of the explorers who noted the name), which may mean \\"bad water\\"; even when full, the lake is one of the saltiest bodies of water in inland NSW, almost as saline as seawater. However, the name is also similar to regional indigenous word for eagle, which often fly there. The first European to visit the lake was Joseph Wild on 19 August 1820,Canberra's Engineering Heritage, William Charles Andrews, Institution of Engineers, Canberra, 1990 p2 and it was named for King George III on 28 October 1820 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie, who was touring the area as part of a Royal Commission inquiring into the condition of the Colony.Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia, 1931 (ABS cat. no. 1301.0) Looking east over a dry lake bed A large and beautiful billabong existed at the northern end of the lake, and in the 1850s it was stocked by the landowner with Murray cod fished out of the Molonglo River at Yarralumla. At some time the billabong overflowed and introduced Murray cod into the lake itself. They bred rapidly and, from the 1850s to the 1890s, Lake George abounded with them. The long Federation Drought commenced in the mid-1890s, and by 1902 the lake had dried out completely. In their search for water to survive in, the Murray cod flocked into the mouths of the few small creeks feeding the lake and were killed by the thousands. One of the original 75 electoral divisions of the Australian House of Representatives in 1901 was named \\"Werriwa\\". By 1913, it no longer included the lake, and the electorate is currently centred in the south-western suburbs of Sydney. In the early 1900s an area immediately to the east of the lake was surveyed as a possible site for the capital city of Australia. Instead, the Australian Capital Territory and city of Canberra were established some south-west of the lake. During World War II, a wooden 'dummy' ship was floated on the lake and used for bombing practice by the Royal Australian Air Force. It is possible that there is still unexploded ordnance settled into the lake bed. On 8 July 1956 five cadets from the Royal Military College, Duntroon died due to hypothermia in a yachting accident. Due to the drought in New South Wales, Lake George dried out completely in November 2002, and remained so until February 2010 when it started to refill. The previous time the lake had dried out completely was during a severe drought in the 1940s, although it was partially dry in 1986, leaving large pools of water. When the lake is empty it is used by farmers to graze sheep and cattle. During September 2016, the lake filled for the first time since 1996. In the intervening years the level of water in the lake had never been as high as that in September 2016. Rainfall in the ACT during August 2020 helped to partly fill the lake again after several more years of drought. The unusual fluctuations in the water level have given rise to fanciful urban myths that the lake is somehow connected to lakes in Peru or South Africa, although NSW government ecologist Justin Nancarrow theorises that the lake may indeed be connected to the nearby Yass River by subterranean aquifers which pass under the surrounding escarpment, and that this connection may explain the salinity of the river. Wind-power generation The Capital Wind Farm completed in 2009 is located along the south-eastern side of Lake George. Locality Lake George is a locality covering territory on the western and southern edges of the lake, largely within the area of the Queanbeyan–Palerang Regional Council, although some hillside areas are in the Yass Valley Council. At the , it had a population of 98.

It is the largest natural body of water and the second-largest body of water in North Dakota after Lake Sakakawea. It can reach a level of before naturally flowing into the Sheyenne River via the Tolna Coulee. On June 27, 2011, it reached an unofficial historical high elevation of . The cities of Devils Lake, North Dakota and Minnewaukan, North Dakota take their name from the lake as does the Spirit Lake Reservation, which is located on the lake's southern shores. History The present site of Devils Lake is historically territory of the Dakota people. The Sisseton, Wahpeton, and Cut-Head bands of Dakotas were relocated to the Spirit Lake Reservation as a result of the 1867 treaty with the United States that established a reservation for Dakotas who had not been forcibly relocated to Crow Creek Reservation in what is now called South Dakota. The name \\"Devils Lake\\" is a calque of the Dakota words mni (water) wak’áŋ (literally \\"pure source\\", also translated as \\"spirit\\" or \\"sacred\\"). The Dakota consider it holy because they believe it is the home of the underwater serpent Unktehi. The Dakota name is reflected in the name of the Spirit Lake Tribe and the nearby town of Minnewaukan. European-American settlers mistranslated the name to mean \\"Bad Spirit Lake\\", or \\"Devils Lake\\". The \\"bad\\" referred to the high salinity of the lake, making it unfit to drink, and \\"spirit\\" meant the mirages often seen across the water. The Christian concept of the devil is not present in Dakota philosophy. The Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nations also accessed the lake, and the Arikara name for it is čiwahaahwaarúxti and the Hidatsa name is mirixubaash (\\"sacred water\\"). Geography Devils Lake is located in Ramsey County and Benson County in northeastern North Dakota. The Spirit Lake Tribe occupies most of the southern shore and has been adversely affected by flooding since the 1990s. Hydrology Devils Lake is the endorheic, or closed, lake of a drainage basin of some , the Devils Lake Basin. The lake collects around 86 percent of the basin's water runoff.Devils Lake Basin Joint Water Resource Board. North Dakota State Water Commission. 2006. 2006 Devils Lake Basin Water Management Plan . Above an elevation of AMSL, the lake spills into neighboring Stump Lake. At , the combined lake flows naturally into the Sheyenne River, though the lake has not reached this level in approximately 1,000 years. The Sheyenne River is a tributary to the Red River, which flows into Canada, with eventual exit into the Hudson Bay. Dike protection is set at . Under normal conditions, Devils Lake is shallow, saline, and hypereutrophic (very high in nutrients). During periods of excessive precipitation, however, the lake can be up to deep, eutrophic (rich in minerals, nutrients, and organisms), with decreased salinity due to dilution. Salinity Because Devils Lake is endorheic, the lake tends to be much higher in salinity than are lakes with outlets to river systems. This is similar to the Great Salt Lake in Utah.Rosenberg, Sheryl A. 2000. \\"A Canadian Perspective on the Devils Lake Outlet: Towards an Environmental Assessment Model for the Management of Transboundary Disputes.\\" North Dakota Law Review 76: 817–59. Lower water levels increase salinity threatening fish and wildlife. Salinity levels in the lake have been one prominent aspect of the debate over diversion of lake water into the Sheyenne River, with questions of the potential environmental impact of the diverted water on downstream rivers, lakes, and communities. Flooding Historical Elevations of Devils Lake, 1860–2008 Devils Lake: 1984 Partially submerged trees in 2002 Devils Lake: 2009 Devils Lake is well known for its wide variations in lake levels,Runaway Devils Lake » American Scientist with large swings between low and high water levels. This owes in large part to its nature as a closed-basin lake, lacking a natural outlet. The release of water is dependent upon evaporation and seepage. The low, flat terrain around Devils Lake consists of various coulees, channels, and basins, which may be separated during times of low water, or connected during high water. Thus the boundaries of the lake can vary greatly from year to year, depending on the amount of precipitation. The draining of wetlands to develop agricultural land in the area has aggravated flooding at Devils Lake. Drainage of the basin's wetlands and conversion of the basin's native prairie to cropland has resulted in water moving more rapidly into the lake, increasing water levels.Bryn, Eric M. 1996. \\"Through a Biodiversity Looking-Glass: An Analysis of the Devils Lake Water Management Plan.\\" Great Plains Natural Resources Journal 1: 65–96. In addition, the diversion of natural water flows is also considered to have contributed to the flooding. An increase in precipitation between 1993 and 1999 caused the lake to double in size, forcing the displacement of more than 300 homes and flooding of farmland. The Spirit Lake Tribe, whose reservation is along part of the lake, suffered considerable damage to homes and lands. Attempts to mitigate the flooding have reportedly cost North Dakota and the U.S. government more than $450 million. Efforts to control flooding include artificial outlets, dike construction and moving railroad lines, roads, and power lines.\\"Devils Lake Basin in North Dakota.\\" United States Geological Survey Water Science Center. http://nd.water.usgs.gov/devilslake/index.html . Future climate as projected by 17 different global climate models indicates overall increase in both precipitation and temperature in the Devils Lake region leading to the lake's overspill probability (24-47% without the outlet and 3.5-14.4% with the full capacity outlet) into the nearby Sheyenne River.Kharel, G. & Kirilenko, A. 2018. \\"Comparing CMIP-3 and CMIP-5 climate projections on flooding estimation of Devils Lake of North Dakota, USA,\\" PeerJ https://peerj.com/articles/4711/?td=wk. In response to the flooding, the U.S. Congress directed the Army Corps of Engineers to research construction of an outlet in 1997 to control the lake level through methods other than evaporation or natural overflow. The Corps' design included mechanisms for filtration and monitoring of the water, and was estimated to cost $186.5 million.Brouwer, Greg. 2003. \\"Corps Approves Devils Lake Diversion,\\" Civil Engineering: 18–19. The state of North Dakota objected to the cost and certain water quality provisions of the plan, and declined to participate in construction of the Corps' outlet. In 2003, the state constructed its own outlet to divert water from Devils Lake into the Sheyenne River, at a cost of $28 million. The outlet was completed in 2005, but was not operated in 2006 due to water quality and biota issues. The outlet operated at the maximum permitted rate for the first time in July 2009. The National Weather Service is the official federal government agency responsible for observing and predicting water levels at Devils Lake.National Weather Service hydrograph for Devils Lake: http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=fgf&gage;=dcbn8&view;=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 Recreation Devils Lake has been known for a long time for fishing and other watersports. It has been named the perch capital of the world. There are a number of boat ramps and other facilities around the lake to facilitate recreational activities on the lake. Recreation in the form of open water and ice fishing is estimated to have generated more than $20 million annually. White Horse Hill National Game Preserve is located on the lake's southern shore. Grahams Island State Park is located on an island in the lake. Other parks on the lake include Black Tiger State Recreation Area and Shelvers Grove State Recreation Area, which is now closed due to the lake's flooding. Issues and controversies Outlet controversy One of two large pumps used in the state-constructed outlet. During the most recent wet cycle which began in 1993, the lake rose over , inundating of primarily agricultural land. This required the expenditure of more than $400 million in flood protection measures.Kempf, Bart. 2007. \\"Draining Devils Lake: The International Lawmaking Problems Created by the Devils Lake Outlet,\\" Georgetown International Environmental Law Review. Some stakeholders argued for construction of an emergency outlet into the Sheyenne River, which is a tributary of the Red River of the North. The Army Corps of Engineers proposed to draw water from a different point of the lake, provide filtration, and discharge a maximum of of water from Devil's Lake, in order to lessen dependence on overflow or evaporation to reduce water levels.Hollis, Duncan B. 2007. \\"Disaggregating Devils Lake: Can Non-State Actors, Hegemony, or Principal-Agent Theory Explain the Boundary Waters Treaty?\\" In Responsibility of Individuals, States and Organizations. The Corps of Engineers estimated its project costs to amount to $186.5 million, with the United States Congress designating $100 million to the project; North Dakota would have paid the remaining amount. Because the project potentially affected the Red River of the North, which runs into Canadian waters, the project was considered to be subject to the Boundary Waters Treaty, and international issues were raised. Led by Republican Governor John Hoeven, North Dakota objected to the water quality provisions and the amount of funding required. Instead it constructed its own outlet, with approval of the North Dakota Department of Health, the U.S. State Department, and Council on Environmental Quality. This outlet, which cost $28 million, has a lower maximum discharge than the federal proposal (limited to a maximum of by the Section 402 NDPDES Permit); its gravel filter removes only larger organisms. But it has provided some relief to the flood problem.Landers, Jay. 2005, Oct. \\"North Dakota Begins Operating Devils Lake Diversion,\\" Civil Engineering: 18. Construction began in 2003 and was completed as of summer 2005. The state outlet project was opposed by the governments of Minnesota and Manitoba, Canada. They argue the outlet would create the potential for the transfer of unknown foreign aquatic species and high levels of sulfates into the Red River basin, an important agricultural area, and Lake Winnipeg, the world's 10th-largest freshwater lake. In March 2004, Manitoba, along with Minnesota and several environmental groups, sued the North Dakota Department of Health in state court over the Devils Lake Outlet 402 NDPDES Permit. The court ruled the outlet could proceed in August 2004 and May 2005. The Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 established an intermediary, the International Joint Commission (IJC), through which the United States and Canada can solve cross-boundary water disputes, but the commission has no power to act without invocation by both nations.Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 Canada attempted to invoke the IJC for purposes of conflict resolution, but the United States did not, effectively preventing the IJC from taking part in the controversy.Flanders, Joseph M. 2006. \\"Transboundary Water Disputes on an International and State Platform: A Controversial Resolution to North Dakota's Devils Lake Dilemma,\\" North Dakota Law Review 82, 3. The Government of Canada argues that the diversion by the state, without consultation or approval from Canada, is a violation of the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 and Canada's national sovereignty. The U.S. government contends the diversion will not be harmful, nor will it violate the treaty under current conditions. In November 2005, a joint United States and Canadian study concluded that none of the 13 species Canada classifies as invasive were present in Devils Lake. The study did find three species of fish parasites that are not currently known to exist in Lake Winnipeg (to which the Red River flows). However, all three are ubiquitous to the waters of North America and have a wide variety of hosts. A difficulty inherent in determining what species are in Devils Lake versus Lake Winnipeg results from spatial relationships and scale. Lake Winnipeg covers approximately , dozens of times larger than Devils Lake. In addition, the Devils Lake Basin is significantly smaller than the watersheds feeding Lake Winnipeg, including the Saskatchewan River basin at approximately . Drawing conclusions about the biological community already in Lake Winnipeg is difficult, due to the relative lack of biological sampling there compared to that of the smaller Devils Lake. Carp Due to the rising waters of the Devils Lake and its basin, streams can flow into the Red River Valley or the Devils Lake Basin. The Red River Valley basin contains a \\"rough fish\\", the common carp, which the North Dakota Game and Fish Department fears will enter Devils Lake basin waters in the near future, allowing the carp to populate Devils Lake. The carp's fast reproductive growth and the lack of carp predators in the lake will likely help it to dramatically increase in population. This could have drastic consequences for existing populations of game fish, such as the walleye and northern pike, which could greatly harm the sport fishing industry. Some preventive measures have been proposed, including inserting chemicals in the creeks along the boundary of the Devils Lake Basin and the Red River Valley to kill fish. Biologists did tests in 2005 which conclude that there are currently no carp in the Devils Lake Basin, but some have been found within two miles (3 km). The carp appear to have been stalled by the abundant cattail plants, which makes travel impossible for the fish. Railroad problems Due to the lake's rising waters, the BNSF Railway temporarily suspended freight traffic between Devils Lake and Churchs Ferry, a total of , during 2009-2013\\\\. However, Amtrak's Empire Builder continued to operate over this segment. BNSF offered Amtrak the right to instead operate the Empire Builder over the Northern Transcon route, to which freight traffic had been shifted. To compensate for the loss of station stops at Grand Forks, Devils Lake, and Rugby, North Dakota that would have been caused by the shift, BNSF suggested that Amtrak add a station stop at New Rockford, North Dakota. However, Amtrak said that they would continue using the line by the lake. In 2010, analysts estimated that Amtrak would soon either have to rebuild the bridge that crosses the lake at Churchs Ferry, or reroute its passenger trains.Fred W. Frailey, \\"Minus its backbone, Amtrak makes a tempting target,\\" Trains, August 2010, p. 18 On June 15, 2011, BNSF and Amtrak agreed to rebuild the rail line, whereby each would cover one-third of the cost. The state of North Dakota received a federal TIGER grant to pay for the remaining third. The growth of freight traffic associated with oil from the Bakken formation in this period resulted in BNSF upgrading its assessment of the importance of the Devils Lake line.Ross B. Capon, \\"AMTRAK’S LONG-DISTANCE TRAINS: BRIEF HISTORY, BENEFITS, INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES\\", for Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission, 9 June 2014; accessed 1 November 2016, Grand Forks Herald After the track was rebuilt and raised, through service resumed from Devils Lake to Churchs Ferry.

They are primarily native to East Africa from Sudan to northern South Africa, but half a dozen species are found in the upper Congo River Basin and two species (N. rubroreticulatus and N. thierryi) are from west-central Africa; the greatest species richness is in Tanzania. Nothobranchius typically inhabit ephemeral pools that are filled only during the monsoon season, and show extreme life-history adaptations to survive the dry season. When their habitats dry up, the adult fish die and the eggs survive encased in the clay during the dry season. The embryos survive the dry season by entering diapause, facilitated by their specialized eggs that have a very hard chorion and are resistant to desiccation and hypoxia.Alexander Dorn, Zuzana Musilová, Matthias Platzer, Kathrin Reichwald and Alessandro Celler (2014) The strange case of East African annual fishes: aridification correlates with diversification for a savannah aquatic group?

The program included broadcasts of a variety of sports, although it is primarily remembered for its focus on boxing matches. Overview and background The Cavalcade of Sports officially began on radio in 1942 as the Gillette Company grouped various existing sports sponsorships under one banner. The sponsorships had begun three years earlier, according to an article on the Gillette Company in Vol. 68 of the International Directory of Company Histories. In 1939, Gillette president Joseph Spang purchased the sponsorship rights to the World Series on behalf of Gillette for $100,000. A special promotion of Gillette razors and blueblades sold four times better than company estimates, resulting in the company seeking out additional sponsorships for sporting events. The Gillette stable of radio sports programs spanned several different networks (including the NBC Red Network, CBS Radio Network and the Mutual Broadcasting System) and grew to include not only ongoing sponsorship deals with Major League Baseball for the World Series and All-Star Game, but the annual Kentucky Derby horse race and the Cotton Bowl Classic and Orange Bowl in college football. In his book about Gillette's history Cutting Edge, author Gordon McKibben wrote, \\"most males in the 1940s and 1950s did not have to be told that the Cavalcade of Sports meant Gillette was sponsoring another ball game or horse race\\". The diversified field of sporting events continued onto television, reportedly including at least two golfing tournaments as well as college football's Blue–Gray Classic and (beginning in 1958) the Rose Bowl game. As late as 1988, the Cavalcade of Sports banner was used in connection with Gillette's sponsorship of the NHL's Stanley Cup Playoffs. Internationally, the Gillette World Sports program continues the concept to the present day in many international regions from Ireland to Africa to Asia. With all of this, however, the Cavalcade of Sports was best known for its Friday night boxing broadcasts that aired on NBC from 1946 to 1960, and then, after NBC decided against featuring boxing due to sensitivity over criminal allegations in the sport, for several more years on ABC. As Cavalcade of Sports Its earlier iteration, Cavalcade of Sports, likewise a boxing show, ran on NBC's New York City station WNBT (channel 4, now WNBC) intermittently beginning in 1943 and was picked up by the NBC television network three years later. The twice-weekly 1946 shows began on Monday, November 8 at 9:00 p.m. and Friday, November 12 at 9:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Both were open-ended programs – as the station signed off the air after the last bout ended (in the early days of television, most stations did not have late-night local newscasts). St. Nicholas Arena in New York City was the site of the earliest bouts and continued to host the Monday night fights until that program's cancellation in May 1949. As Gillette Cavalcade of Sports The Friday night program, broadcast from Madison Square Garden lasted until June 24, 1960, a 14-year period which is, by far, the longest continuous run of any boxing program in television history. The Gillette sponsorship began at the start of the first full television programming season, 1948-49. On September 4, the program was retitled The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports, a name that remained until the end of its run. Every great boxer of the time – including among others Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Archie Moore, Rocky Graziano, Willie Pep – appeared on one or more of its broadcasts. In the early years of television, there was a saturation of boxing programs, as many as six prime-time network programs in one week, not even counting the myriad local shows. With so much boxing airing simultaneously, all weight divisions had a chance at stardom, not just heavyweight contenders. Commentators Bob Haymes (using the stage name Bob Stanton) was the program's original announcer; he was joined by Ray Forrest in 1948. Jimmy Powers took over the role in 1949 and remained NBC's main boxing announcer until the network ceased carrying prime time boxing matches in 1960. Theme music The show's theme music was the \\"Look Sharp/Be Sharp March\\" by Mahlon Merrick, an upbeat tune that was recorded, published (and sheet music printed) sometime between 1953 and 1956. It received quite a bit of airplay on U.S. radio programs, and was used in the repertoire of many high school and college bands of the period. There is a 1954 rendition of the song by the Boston Pops under Arthur Fiedler on YouTube. The \\"March\\" was used in the 1980 film Raging Bull during a scene in which the Robert De Niro character Jake LaMotta unveils his new nightclub. Coleco's Head-to-Head Boxing handheld video game, released in 1981, played the most identifiable eight-note part of the tune when turned on and the first three notes of that at the start of each round. The music is also used in the Punch-Out!! series of video games published by Nintendo, and the 1993 Argentine film Gatica, el mono. Recognition Awards and nominations The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports won an Emmy Award for Best Sports Program in 1955. It also received an Emmy nomination for Best Sports or News Program in 1954. Nielsen ratings According to Nielsen, the program finished at #6 for the 1950-51 season; it slide to #19 in 1951-52 and then to #24 in 1952-53 before rebounding somewhat to #18 in 1953-54. No other boxing series has ever ranked in the Nielsen top 10 in its season ratings. Latin America In the late 1940s, when the Cavalcade was aired through NBC Red Network extended their Spanish programming activities to Latin American countries, where it was known as the Cabalgata Deportiva Gillette. Its schedule included the MLB Game of the Week aired on Saturday afternoons, the MLB All-Star Game in the midseason and the fall World Series.Smith, Curt (2011). A Talk in the Park: Nine Decades of Baseball Tales from the Broadcast Booth. Potomac Books. . On there, shared duties Spanish-language broadcasters such as Pancho Pepe Cróquer, Buck Canel, and Felo Ramírez. During the opening presentation, Canel habitually introduced Cróquer as La Voz Deportiva de América. In addition, the Cavalcade broadcast the bouts of every great fighter of the time, including Rocky Marciano, Archie Moore, Willie Pep, Sugar Ray Robinson, Sandy Saddler and Jersey Joe Walcott,Winn, J. Emmett Winn; Brinson, Susan Lorene Brinson (2005). Transmitting the Past: Historical and Cultural Perspectives on Broadcasting. University Alabama Press. . whose fights were accurately and succinctly described by Cróquer on its Friday nights broadcasts from Madison Square Garden. He is particularly remembered for his emotional description on the second of four matches held between Pep and Saddler, which was aired in February 1949.You Tube Audio: Willie Pep against Sandy Sadler; 15th round of their second match on February 11, 1949 (Spanish).

Located on the Victorian side of the Murray River, Mildura had a population of 33,444 in 2016. When nearby Wentworth, Irymple, Nichols Point and Merbein are included, the area had an estimated urban population of 51,903 Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. at June 2018, having grown marginally at an average annual rate of 0.88% year-on-year over the preceding five years. It is the largest settlement in the Sunraysia region. Mildura is a major horticultural centre notable for its grape production, supplying 80% of Victoria's grapes.Mildura , Department of Planning and Community Development, Mildura Rural City Council, Accessed 27 September 2007 Many wineries also source grapes from Mildura. The city's central business district is located just a short distance from the banks of the Murray. Langtree Avenue is the main shopping and dining precinct in Mildura, with the middle section of the street a pedestrian mall. The other major retail precinct is along Fifteenth Street in the Mildura South area, where a mid-sized undercover shopping mall and several big box stores are located. The city's name was taken from the Mildura homestead, an early sheep station which covered most of the area. The urban area of Mildura is surrounded by irrigated horticulture, where the original grape and citrus blocks were located with water irrigated from the Murray River.  History  Mildura has a long history of orange and grape farming.  Toponymy  There are several theories as to the origin of the name Mildura. While it was the name of the sheep station, without precedent in the English language, most historians believe it to have originated from Aboriginal Australian words. However, the etymology of Mildura is not certain, as in several local dialects, the words mill and dura have different meanings. The word dura is generally thought to mean \\"earth\\", \\"sand\\" or \\"rock\\" in the local Ladji Ladji language. However, usage of the word mill varies by dialect and may mean \\"red\\" or \\"water\\",Mildura Homestead – Mildura Arts Centre . Yourartscentre.com.au. Retrieved on 18 August 2011. and thus, interpretations of the name can vary from \\"red earth\\" to \\"water rock\\".  Prehistory and European settlement  William Blandowski's 1857 depiction of Jarijari (Nyeri Nyeri) people including men hunting, women cooking and children playing near Merbein, Victoria. A form of kick and catch football is apparently being played in the background.From William Blandowski's Australien in 142 Photographischen Abbildungen, 1857, (Haddon Library, Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge) Many Aboriginal people lived around the site of Mildura because of the abundant food. Local tribes included the Latjilatji and Jarijari. The first Europeans in the area arrived in 1857 and brought sheep to graze the rich pastures.  Irrigation settlement  A major drought in Victoria from 1877 to 1884 prompted Alfred Deakin, then a minister in the State Government and chairman of a Royal Commission on water supply to visit the irrigation areas of California. There he met George and William Chaffey. In 1886, Canadian-American irrigator George Chaffey came to Australia and selected a derelict sheep station known as Mildura as the site for his first irrigation settlement, signing an agreement with the Victorian government to spend at least £300,000 on permanent improvements at Mildura in the next twenty years. After much political wrangling, the settlement of Mildura was established in 1887. The Post Office opened on 23 January 1888.  Growth  Guinness Book of Records as the longest bar in the world until 1995 when it was removed during renovations. The nearby towns of Wentworth, Gol Gol, Curlwaa and Yelta sprang up in the mid-to-late 19th century. In the 1890s came the scourge of the rabbit. This devastated the sheep farmers, especially south of the Murray. There was also a financial recession at this time. Combined, these factors restricted growth of the new settlement. After this period, the new settlement grew and grew. It was soon the main town of the district. Suburbs and new satellite towns sprang up. From the 1920s, a number of 'suburban' train services were established to Merbein and Red Cliffs.The Mildura Suburban Train Service McLean, Bruce Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, September, 1978 pp189-205 These were operated by railcars. Post war Mildura experienced a large influx of migrants particularly from European and Mediterranean countries including Italy and Greece. Many of these migrants were attracted by the unskilled labour offered by the fruit picking industry. In 1934 Mildura was officially proclaimed a city. Langtree Avenue, 1950  Nowingi toxic waste proposal  In 2004 there was a controversial proposal by the Victorian Government to build a state-level Long Term Containment Facility (LTCF) for Industrial Waste in Nowingi, approximately 50 km south of Mildura. The site is a small enclave of state forest surrounded by national park, and contains habitat important to a number of threatened species. The abandoning of the LTCF proposal was received with jubilation by opponents of the LTCF not only in the Mildura area and elsewhere in Victoria, but also across the border in South Australia where there were fears that in reputation, if not in substance, the toxic waste could affect the water supply via the Murray River and thereby the fruit-growing industries of the Riverland and Murraylands. The Mildura Rural City Council and residents spent almost $2 million fighting the Government's proposal for the LTCF at Nowingi. On 10 January 2007 the Victorian Government did not rule out some form of reimbursement for the Rural City of Mildura council's legal and other costs in opposing the LTCF. \\"The general rule is that people bear their own costs, that is most likely to apply in this case ... but I've indicated and I am prepared to talk to the council and mayor about the whole issue of how Mildura moves forward and I'll do that,\\" John Thwaites said.  Geography   Topography  Mildura is situated on flat land without hills or mountains on the southern bank of the Murray River and surrounded to the west, north and east by lakes and billabongs including Lake Hawthorn, Lake Ranfurly and Lake Gol Gol. Several towns surround Mildura on the flat plains including Merbein to the west as well as Irymple and Red Cliffs to the south which could be considered suburban areas or satellite towns separated by small stretches of open farmland. While the land along the river and irrigation channels is fertile, much of the land around Mildura is also dry, saline and semi- arid.Mildura – Wyperfeld NP . Visitmildura.com.au (18 June 2007). Retrieved on 18 August 2011.  Urban structure  Mildura is a largely low-rise and low density urban area that is overwhelmingly dependent upon private automobiles for transportation. Residential dwellings consist almost solely of single- family detached homes on relatively large allotments. The population has been growing rapidly for several decades and most of the residential growth has occurred in the south-western and southern parts of the urban area. The central business district is located at the northern end of the urban area, fronting onto the Murray River. The main shopping street of Mildura is Langtree Avenue, which features a pedestrian mall and shopping centre. However, this shopping precinct competes with the Mildura Central Shopping Centre, located at the opposite end of the urban area on the corner of Fifteenth Street and Deakin Avenue. Fifteenth Street is also the main strip of big box stores and other commercial enterprises. The tallest buildings are the two-storey 1934 Old Mildura Base Hospital, two-storey Marina Dockside apartments completed in 2010 and the three-storey tower/spire of the 1920s T&G; building.  Climate  Mildura has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk) with hot summers and cool winters. It is only about 50 metres above sea level despite being several hundred kilometres from the coast. Rainfall totals are about 280 mm a year and are spread evenly across the months and seasons with Winter and Spring having the most rainy days. Average maximum temperatures range from a hot in summer to a mild in winter. Minimum temperatures range from around in summer to in winter, when frost is common and often destructive to irrigated crops. Mildura experiences some very hot days in summer with temperatures exceeding 40 °C (104 °F) on a number of days per year. Mildura got record daily rainfall on 5 February 2011 with .  Economy  Grape vines growing in Mildura during December 2006. Mildura is also known as the centre of Victoria's Food Bowl and is a major producer of citrus fruits (especially oranges), and wine. It is also notable for its grape production, supplying 80% of Victoria's grapes. Many wineries also source grapes from Mildura. The local area produces more than 70% of Australia's dried vine fruits.  Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone  Mildura is part of the Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone, in which fruits or vegetables may not be taken into the area (they can, however, be taken out). This is to stop the Queensland fruit fly from invading crops and plantations which could have a devastating effect on the economy. Disposal bins into which fruit can be disposed of are located along highways entering the zone.  Tourism  Mildura's paddlesteamers, such as the PS Melbourne, are popular with tourists Tourism is a A$210 million industry in Mildura. However, a large percentage (30%) are domestic tourists visiting friends or relatives. The city's situation on the Murray River makes it a hub for watersports, paddlesteamers and boat cruises. The still conditions make Mildura ideal for hot air ballooning and the Mildura International Balloon Fiesta attracts many visitors. The Australian Inland Botanic Gardens, located nearby in Mourquong is another popular attraction which draws visitors to the city.  Mildura Central  Mildura Central's (formerly Centro Mildura) extensive redevelopment in 2005 has positioned the centre as the major shopping destination within the Sunraysia region. Mildura Central is also the only fully enclosed, air-conditioned centre in this area and offers a retail mix including representation from a number of national fashion stores. Serving a primary trade area population of 60,000 residents, Mildura Central also receives consumers from beyond the trade area including the Riverland, Swan Hill, Robinvale and Broken Hill. It includes a large Target, a Big W to the side of Mildura Central, a 19 aisle Woolworths and a Coles supermarket across the road.  Development proposals  Mildura's location in Victoria and consistently strong local lobbyingIles, Kieran. (16 August 2010) New voice for Mildura growth – Local News – News – General . Sunraysia Daily. Retrieved on 18 August 2011. have seen the Government of Victoria take an interest in the city as a possible centre for population and industry decentralisation programs. There have been numerous proposals involving the state government for large scale developments and investments, many ambitious and speculative that have been shelved indefinitely. Given the large amount of sunlight Mildura receives, it is the site for several proposals for large scale solar power in Australia including a massive solar updraft tower proposal in 2004 and 2010.Victorian government may help build a solar power plant at Mildura. Watoday.com.au (22 September 2010). Retrieved on 18 August 2011. In 2013, Mildura Solar Concentrator Power Station, a 1.5 MW demonstration plant, was commissioned by Silex Systems and it was expected to be expanded to 100 MW by 2017. However, in August 2014, the project was abandoned by Silex, due to lack of commitment to renewable energy by the Abbott government. The government's plans to scrap the praised Renewable Energy Target (RET) in Australia were cited as one of the main reasons for abandoning the project. International scientists criticised this decision extensively, claiming Australia risks being \\"left behind the rest of the world\\" if it cuts its plans for renewable energy. The decision to not build the plant may also cause electricity prices to rise significantly in the country. Another large development which has been controversial was the proposal for Mildura to be the site for Victoria's second casino.Mildura casino plans unveiled – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation). Abc.net.au (26 March 2010). Retrieved on 18 August 2011.  Culture  Rio Vista, the former home of Canadian engineer William Chaffey, built in the Queen Anne style. Since early settlement Mildura has been home to artists, writers and creative people. Organisations such as the Red Cliffs Musical Society, Eisteddfod, Mildura Ballet Guild and Mildura Country Music Festival have helped grow a reputation for home grown talent and creative community. The hub of this community is the Mildura Arts Centre, which began as a gallery space at Rio Vista House in the 1950s and became fully established in 1956 with the building of a new regional art gallery and performing arts theatre. In 2012, after two years of construction, the new Mildura Arts Centre opened. Mildura is host to many annual festivals such as the Mildura Country Music Festival, the International Balloon Fiesta, the Jazz Food & Wine Festival, Mildura Wentworth Arts Festival, Murray River International Music Festival, Mildura Writers Festival, Mildura Palimpsest, and the Mildura Show. There is also the annual Mildura masters coarse fishing competition held in November which attracts a number of international and local coarse anglers and the Australian Alternative Varieties Wine Show  Demographics  As of the , there were 33,444 people residing in 15,320 households. Indigenous Australians make up 4.6% of Mildura's population. 77.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.4%, Italy 1.1%, India 0.9%, New Zealand 0.9% and Afghanistan 0.8%. 80.0% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian 1.7%, Turkish 1.1%, Tongan 0.8%, Hazaragi 0.7% and Mandarin 0.7%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion, so described 33.1%, Catholic 21.8% and Anglican 11.3%.  Crime  In 2018 Mildura recorded the highest rural crime rate in Victoria and the fourth highest crime rate in the state overall. Organised crime Mildura has long been associated with the Calabrian Mafia, with claims made by police in 1966 that annual organised crime meetings were held in Mildura to co-ordinate nationwide criminal activities. In a 1960s National Anti-Mafia Directorate report by John T. Cusack (United States' Bureau of Narcotics) and Dr Ugo Macera (assistant commissioner of police in Calabria) claims were made that the \\"ancient Calabrian Secret Criminal Society known as the L'Onorata Societa\\" and the \\"'Ndrangheta\\" were operating \\"throughout the State, with large segments in the fruit growing and farming areas of Mildura and Shepparton\\" adding that \\"There are reports the Society has existed in Victoria since 1930\\". They have reportedly been involved in revenge killings, cannabis production and weapons purchases. During the 1980s the Mildura Mafia emerged as a major crime group that dominated marijuana production in Australia and ran an Australia-wide money-laundering network. Several notable mafia murders have been linked to the region including the suspected mafia hit on 43-year-old Marco Medici in 1983, police believe the murder may be connected to the assassination of anti-drug crusader Donald MacKay at Griffith in 1977. The 1984 murders of Melbourne gangsters Rocco Medici and Giuseppe Furina are also connected to Mildura through the Medici family. In 1982, 42-year-old Mildura greengrocer Dominic Marafiote and his parents were murdered after Marafiote gave South Australian police the names of Calabrian mafia bosses in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. In 2016 Mildura residents Nicola Ciconte, Vincenzo Medici and Michael Calleja were convicted and sentenced in Italy for their role in a plot to smuggle up to 500 kilograms of cocaine into Australia. Ice epidemic Mildura has recorded significantly higher than average rates of methamphetamine use. Rural methamphetamine use overall is 2.5 times higher than in metropolitan areas. Prior to 2010 rates of use of illicit drugs in rural areas were significantly lower than those in the cities. In 2014, a Mildura-based Comancheros Motorcycle Club member and former Australian Defence Force (ADF) sniper, Joshua Faulkhead, was arrested after being caught transporting large quantities of methamphetamine, cocaine and ecstasy between Sydney and Mildura. Faulkhead was sentenced to nine years and five months in jail. In 2015, 20 people were involved in a large drug trafficking operation in Mildura in north-west Victoria. Methamphetamine, marijuana and ecstasy were seized in raids. The drugs seized were reported to be worth more than $15,000. $20,000 in cash were seized and a number of weapons were also seized. Later that same year, Stephen Gillard and Geoffrey Hitchen from South Penrith, were arrested for possession of $300,000 worth of methamphetamines in scrubland off the Mallee Highway at Tutye, west of Ouyen. Local farmers uncovered plastic fruit juice bottles containing the drugs after noticing the men behaving strangely the previous day. In 2017, a joint Australian Federal Police (AFP) and United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigation lead to the seizure of $2.4 million in cash at the Mildura Airport, after 255 kilograms crystal methamphetamine were found at a storage facility in Northern California in June. The bust was part of an investigation into an alleged conspiracy to use a light plane to export drugs from the US to Australia. The 72-year-old pilot, a 52-year-old man from Zetland, and a 58-year-old Melbourne man were charged with conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of border controlled drugs and money laundering offences. The crystal methamphetamine was reported to be worth $255 million. That arrests were connected to $2.4 million which was found in Mildura, in a prime mover that was driven from Adelaide in April.

Education St Joseph's College In 1905, a small group of Sisters of Mercy came from Wentworth to Mildura and established a convent in a weatherboard building on the corner of Pine Avenue and Tenth Street. Catholic secondary education commenced in Mildura in 1906 when the Sisters of Mercy began conducting classes in rooms attached to the original convent in Pine Avenue. The Certificate of Registration of a School dated 31 December 1906, indicates that sub-primary, primary and secondary classes were being conducted from convent at the time. In 1911 boarding school facilities were provided in Olive Avenue and in 1914 a new school was erected in Walnut Avenue. The first buildings of St Joseph's College at its present site were opened in 1929. The College has well equipped classrooms, science and computer laboratories, creative arts and design and technology complex, religious education centre, library, sports facilities, staff and student amenities. Mildura Senior College The College has been closely linked with the development of Mildura since the opening of the irrigation settlement by the Chaffey's in the 1880s. For example, in 1890 the Governor of Victoria, Lord Hopetoun, laid the foundation stone of what was to become the Chaffey Agricultural College, but unfortunately, because of financial difficulties, the College was not built. In 1911, the Education Department of Victoria agreed to erect a high school on the Chaffey College site, and Mildura High School was officially opened in September 1912. The Diamond Jubilee of the school was celebrated on 8 and 9 September 1972. They celebrated their 75th birthday in August 1987 and in 2012 celebrated their centenary over the weekend of 14–16 September. As part of a strategic plan by the Ministry of Education in 1990, Mildura High School changed its name to Mildura Secondary College to reflect the changing nature of educational delivery in secondary schools. Again as a result of restructuring in education provision since 1995 the College has been known as Mildura Senior College, catering exclusively for the final two years of secondary education. Mildura Senior College has a long and distinguished history of providing quality educational pathways to thousands of young people living in Sunraysia. Mildura Senior College caters exclusively for Year 11 & 12 students. In 2013 there will be approximately 500 students in Year 11 and 400 in Year 12. Entrance to Year 11 is open to all students living in the Sunraysia District who have successfully completed Year 10. The decision regarding the satisfactory completion of Year 10 is the responsibility of the 7-10 College. Enrolment at the College is also dependent on factors such as age, behaviour record and other achievements. Please see the section on enrolment for further information. Chaffey Secondary College Chaffey Secondary College is a Victorian State Government secondary school catering for students in Years 7 to 10 located in Deakin Avenue. In 2012 the college had 640 students enrolled. The college offers 120 to 140 different courses each term as part of its modular learning program. Students and families participate in a program of course counseling and student-led presentations each term to help students create the most appropriate course for their ability, pathway and interests.

Synopsis A widowed New York City resident, Karen St. John (played by Flora Campbell), moved to a small town to be near relatives. There she met a man who had been adopted by her family, and with whom she fell in love. However, he was already engaged to another woman. In addition, the sophisticated St. John clashed with her rural relatives. Jim Von Schilling, in his book, The Magic Window: American Television, 1939-1953, wrote, \\"Soap operas were popular on radio during the 1930s and 1940s; Faraway Hill simply brought the genre to television, where real arms were embraced, real tears shed, and where a card reading 'Continued Next Week' was held before the camera at each episode's climax.\\" Broadcast history The series ran from October 2 to December 18, 1946. David P. Lewis, the writer and director, had a budget of around $300 an episode.Brooks, Tim & Marsh, Earle (1964). The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows (3rd ed.). New York: Ballantine. The first episode originated from the basement of the Greenwich Village Wanamaker's department store. Other actors included Mel Brandt, Eve McVeagh, and Julie Christy (not to be confused with actress Julie Christie). The half-hour show was broadcast live, although filmed excerpts were interspersed, and slides of scenes from previous shows were included in later episodes to bring viewers up to date with regard to plot elements which had previously transpired. A narrator gave Karen's thoughts as bridges between scenes. In 1992, Lewis's obituary in the Los Angeles Times explained the program's short lifespan: \\"Lewis declared at the time that it was only an experiment. It never made a cent and had no commercials. ... He wanted, he said years later, not a successful series but to 'test the mind of the viewer.'\\" In popular culture In Sharon Travers' novel Stranger in Our Midst (part of The Oak Grove Chronicles series), character Melba reflects on watching Faraway Hill: > In a dither of confusion, she also wondered about watching Faraway Hill with > Trudy yesterday. It all seemed so real when you actually watched it on > television, much more so than listening to it on the radio. They were both > caught up in the story, thinking what a sorry mess Karen had gotten herself > into. On February 28, 2006, Faraway Hill was featured in a clue on the television game show Jeopardy!. The $200 clue in the category \\"'S'-ential Knowledge\\" was \\"Broadcast on the Dumont Network in 1946, Faraway Hill is considered the first TV show in this daytime genre\\", with the answer being \\"a soap opera\\". Episode status No footage from the series has survived (the show was done live; methods to record television, such as kinescopes, did not exist until 1947 and videotapes did not become prevalent until 1958). The original scripts are owned by the estate of the Lewis family.

Early life Kalman was born in Budapest and became a U.S. resident in 1956, after he and his family fled Hungary to escape the Soviet invasion, settling in Poughkeepsie, New York. Both of his parents had Jewish ethnic roots, and converted to Catholicism to avoid persecution, so 'Kalman only became aware that he was Jewish at the age of 18'.Paola Antonelli, Tibor Kalman, Perverse Optimist, Booth-Clibborn Editions (1998), p. 54 In 1967, he enrolled in NYU, dropping out after one year of Journalism classes to travel to Cuba to harvest sugar cane and learn about Cuban culture, as a member of the Venceremos Brigade. Career In 1971, Kalman returned to New York City where he was hired by Leonard Riggio for a small bookstore that eventually became Barnes & Noble. He later became the creative director of their in-house design department where he created advertisements, store signs, shopping bags, and the original B&N; bookplate trademark. In 1979, Kalman - along with Carol Bokuniewicz, and Liz Trovato - started the design firm M & Co., which did corporate work for such diverse clients as the Limited Corporation, the new wave rock group Talking Heads, and Restaurant Florent in New York City's Meatpacking District. Quote: Florent Morellet \\"left most of the 1950s luncheonette features intact, and gave Tibor Kalman and M & Co. to create ads and graphics that cultivated a Florent culture that survives today and extends well beyond the walls of the space.\\" He sought to challenge mundane design thinking and aspired to create unpredictable work. Kalman also worked as creative director of Interview magazine in the early 1990s. By the 1980s, Kalman was known for being 'the 'bad boy' of graphic design' because of his antics and radical consciousness. He believed that award-winning design was only possible when the client was ethical, and frequently called other designers out when he did not agree with their actions. He defined good design as a benefit to everyday life and should be used to increase public awareness of social issues. Kalman adopted a vernacular style as a way to protest corporate International Style which was the primary design style of the time. Kalman became founding editor-in-chief of the Benetton-sponsored magazine Colors, in 1991. Two years later, Kalman closed M & Co. and moved to Rome, to work exclusively on Colors. Billed as 'a magazine about the rest of the world', Colors focused on multiculturalism and global awareness. This perspective was communicated through bold graphic design, typography, and juxtaposition of photographs and doctored images, including a series in which highly recognizable figures such as the Pope and Queen Elizabeth were depicted as racial minorities. In 1999, Kalman won the AIGA medal as the 'design profession's moral compass and its most fervent provocateur'. Personal life From 1981 up until his death, Kalman was married to the illustrator and author Maira Kalman. Death and legacy The onset of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma forced Kalman to leave Colors in 1995, and return to New York. In 1997, he re- opened M & Co. and continued to work until his death on May 2, 1999 in Puerto Rico. Tibor Kalman: Perverse Optimist, a book about Kalman's work and that with M&Co;, was published by Princeton Architectural Press in 1999.

The Encyclopedia of Television noted that the program \\"is historically important because it exemplified the issues faced by networks, sponsors, and advertising agencies in television's formative years.\\" Distribution Hour Glass was broadcast only on WNBT (now WNBC) in New York City from May 9, 1946, through November of that year, when distribution to NBC affiliates in Philadelphia and Schenectady began. From that time, the three- city network continued until March 1947. Overview Described as \\"the first [television] hour-long musical variety show\\", Hour Glass was sponsored by Standard Brands, promoting Chase and Sanborn coffee and Tenderleaf Tea. The program included comedians, musicians, entertaining films (such as a film of dance in South America), and a long, live commercial for the sponsor's products. Such famous names as Doodles Weaver, Bert Lahr, Dennis Day, Anton Reiter, Jerry Colonna, Peggy Lee and Joe Besser appeared on the program. The first show was hosted by Evelyn Eaton (daughter of one of The Seven Little Eatons); Life surmised that NBC was adapting to a paradigm shift and making better use of the visual medium by hiring an attractive woman as master of ceremonies, as opposed to the more authoritative voices of men who typically commanded radio variety shows of the era. On November 14, 1946, Edgar Bergen brought his ventriloquism act to the show. It was one of the first times that a major radio performer had appeared on television. Coincidentally, Standard Brands (via Chase and Sanborn) was the sponsor of Bergen's radio program. Duration The Columbia History of American Television attributed the program's short life to its cost and the lack of market penetration for television at the time, saying, \\"Standard Brands invested $200,000 in this series over its ten-month tenure at a time when that level of investment just couldn't be supported and sustained, leading to the Hour Glass's abbreviated run.\\" Another factor was that James Petrillo, president of the American Federation of Musicians forbade musicians from performing on television without an agreement between the AFM and the networks, thus limiting directors and performers to use of recorded music and lip sync. A report in Life at the show's start noted that the show's audience at the time was estimated at 3,500 television sets watched by up to 20,000 viewers, a thousandth of the estimated 20,000,000 radio listeners nationwide that were hearing The Chase and Sanborn Hour on a given week. Personnel The show was co-hosted by Eddie Mayehoff and Helen Parrish. Bergen later became the host of the program. Edward Sobol was the producer. During the series' time on the air, a system of alternating writers was developed, giving \\"an individual writer two weeks in which to write a show instead of the weekly deadline.\\" Critical reception A contemporary review in Life praised the individual performances but panned the production values, noting that camera operators cut off the feet of dancers and that the show lacked the kind of \\"camera virtuosity monopolized by Hollywood.\\" On the whole, the Life review noted that television would need \\"good scripts and better directors\\" if it were to succeed. Existing recordings Audio-only recordings of Hour Glass from 1946–1947, including the inaugural show, are known to exist at the Library of Congress, making the show one of the few shows to have any surviving material from before 1948 still in existence. Photos of the first live Hour Glass broadcast taken from a TV monitor during the live telecast, along with a program review, appear in the May 27, 1946 issue of Life.\\"Commercial Television: First Show is Fuzzy, Funny Life Magazine (May 27, 1946) See also *1946-47 United States network television schedule References External links * Category:1946 American television series debuts Category:1947 American television series endings Category:1940s American variety television series Category:NBC original programming Category:Black-and-white American television shows Category:English-language television shows Category:Lost television shows ","title":"Hour Glass (TV series)"},{"id":"563792","text":"Canvey Island Football Club is a football club based in Canvey Island, Essex, England.

Located in Laconia, in the Peloponnese, it used to form part of the municipal unit of Faris until 31 December 2010. Since 1 January 2011, as part of the Kallikratis reform, it is one of the local communities of the municipality of Sparta. The nearest major towns are Gytheio, to the southeast, and Sparta, approximately 40 km to the north. The area has a rich history. Near the village, at the Arkina site, two Mycenaean-era chamber tombs have been found. Artefacts from many periods have also been found at Arna and Arkina, mostly ceramic containers. These findings support the conclusion that the site has been since ancient times a stop on the road connecting Sparta and Messenia. The residents of Arna featured prominently in the Greek War of Independence (1821-1829). A close-by reminder of that struggle is the \\"Kolokotronis Cave\\", on the north slope of Mt. Annina. Folk tradition has it that Constantine Kolokotronis (father of famed hero Theodoros Kolokotronis) had sought refuge in this cave after being wounded defending the tower of the nearby village of Kastania, at the side of fellow revolutionary Panagiotaros Venetsanakos, a Maniot from Mesa Mani. He was discovered there the next day and killed; his body was thrown into the cave. Today, Arna's population is on the decline, as is the population of the Greek countryside nationwide. The 1971 census counted 324 residents in the village; today, fewer than 150 remain. There are, however, positive signs of increased activity: the number of visits from emigrant Arniotes is on the rise, year round.

The Lingones (Gaulish: \\"the jumpers\\") were a Gallic tribe of the La Tène and Roman periods. They dwelled in the region surrounding the present-day city of Langres, between the provinces of Gallia Lugdunensis and Gallia Belgica.  Name   Attestations  They are mentioned as Língōnes (Λίγγωνες) by Polybius (2nd c. BC),Polybius. Historíai, 2:17:7 as Lingones by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC), Pliny (1st c. AD) and Tacitus (early 2nd c. AD),Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 1:25:6; 1:40:11Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 4:106Tacitus. Historiae, 1:53 as Díngones (Δίγγονες) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD),Strabo. Geōgraphiká, 4:3:4 and as Lóngōnes (Λόγγωνες) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD).Ptolemy. Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis, 2:9:9  Etymology  The name Lingones stems from the Gaulish ling- (\\"to jump\\"), ultimately from the Proto-Celtic verbal base *leng- ('to jump'; compare with Old Irish lingid \\"he jumps\\"). Lingones thus probably meant \\"the jumpers\\", perhaps \\"good at jumping (on horseback)\\", or \\"the dancers\\". The city of Langres, attested as civitas Lingonum ca. 400 AD, is named after the Gallic tribe.  Geography  The territory of the Lingones was situated on the border separating Gallia Lugdunensis from Gallia Belgica, between the Senones and the Sequani.  Settlement  Their capital Andematunnum (present-day Langres, Haute-Marne) is attested from 43 AD on boundary markers (abbreviated as AND). It was built on a Bajocian limestone promontory, overlooking the Marne valley to the east and north, and the Bonnelle valley to the west. Only the southern part, open to the Langres plateau, did not possess natural defences. Archeological evidence have demonstrated a continuity between the La Tène and Roman periods on the site of Langres, and the city of Andematunnum appears to have been built at the turn of the 1st century BC on a previous Gallic settlement. The Roman-era civitas of the Lingones was located at the crossroad of the modern départments of Aube, Haute-Marne, Côte d’Or and Yonne. The Cathedral St- Mammes, built in the Burgundian Romanesque style for the ancient diocese that was referred to as Lingonae (\\"of the Lingones\\") and rivalled Dijon. Three of its early bishops were martyred by the invasion of the Vandals, about 407.  History  Some of the Lingones migrated across the Alps and settled near the mouth of the Po River in Cisalpine Gaul of northern Italy around 400 BC. These Lingones were part of a wave of Celtic tribes that included the Boii and Senones (Polybius, Histories ii.17). The Lingones may have helped sack Rome in 390 BC. The Gaulish Lingones did not participate in the battles of the Gauls against Caesar. They gained Roman citizenship at the end of the first century CE, living in a rich and urbanized society in the region of Langres and Dijon and minting coins. They were caught up in the Batavian rebellion (69 AD) described by Tacitus. The strategist Sextus Julius Frontinus, author of the Strategemata, the earliest surviving Roman military textbook, mentions the Lingones among his examples of successful military tactics: In Roman Britain, at least three named cohorts of Lingones, probably subscripted from among the Lingones who had remained in the area of Langres and Dijon are attested in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, from dedicatory inscriptions and stamped tiles.

The Dragon style is an imitative-style that was developed based on the imagined characteristics of the mythical Chinese dragon. The Dragon played an influential and beneficial role in Chinese culture. An amalgam of several creatures, including monitor lizards, pythons and the Chinese alligator, the polymorphic dragon was a water spirit, responsible for bringing the rains and thus ensuring the survival of crops. The dragon was the symbolic guardian to the gods, and was the source of true wisdom. This latter feature most likely resulted from the observation of the living reptilian counterparts which, usually at rest, seem to be in a near constant state of contemplation. The dragon represented two of the ancient elements, Earth and Water, endowing the creature with powers of illusion and strength. A Yang symbol, the Taoists saw the dragon as a personification of the Tao itself—\\"the Dragon reveals himself only to vanish\\". Shaolin Buddhists saw him as a vision of enlightened truth, to be felt, but never to be held. Certain very old men were called dragons, these being well versed in the life- supporting skills of herbal medicine, agriculture, and kung fu. In early China, these skills were surely a matter of life or death, and those so educated were held in high regard. History The history of Southern Dragon style has historically been transmitted orally rather than by text, so its origins will probably never be known in their entirety. Modern Southern Dragon style's history can be reliably traced back to the monk Daai Yuk Sim Si who was the abbot of Wa Sau Toi (White Hair) temple on Mount Luofu. No reliable records of the style's origin prior to that exist, though there is much speculation regarding the subject. Southern Dragon style has roots in a combination of the local styles of the Hakka heartland in inland eastern Guangdong with the style that the monk Ji Sin Sim Si taught in Guangdong and the neighboring province of Fujian in the 18th century. North of the Dongjiang in the northwest of Bóluó () County in the prefecture of Huizhou in Guangdong Province is the sacred mountain Luófúshān. Luófúshān is the site of many temples, including Wa Sau Toi where, c. 1900, a Chan (Zen) master named Daai Yuk taught Southern Dragon style to Lam Yiu Gwai (1874-1965), who in turn passed the art on to the many students of his schools in Guangzhou. Lam Yiu Gwai and Jeung Lai Chuen (1880-1966) were good friends from their youth in the Dongjiang region of Huizhou, longtime training partners and later cousins by marriage. Lam and Jeung would open several schools together, and Southern Dragon style and Jeung's style of Bak Mei share many similarities. A variation of the Southern Dragon style is taught by the Long Choo Kung Fu Society based in Penang, Malaysia and with branches in Australia. Founded by Li Ah Yu and his father near the turn of the 20th century, this association claims it is teaching a Soft/ Hard Dragon style originating from Fukkien province. Methods and philosophy Southern Dragons kung fu is essentially an internal qi (pronounced chi) cultivation method, but initialisation training is far more like a hard, external style, than the delicate approach an internal (like it's chi ch'uan or baguazhang) would have. In learning the moves, the student will strike hard, block hard and rush into each position, with the idea of learning the proper place to be once each movement is complete. Eventually, the method of transmitting power is retained, and the physically strengthened body is able to make transitions in the proper, fluid manner. In turn, this dragon-like smoothness helps disguise the attack, making it extremely difficult for an adversary to effectively counter. Once a purely physical semblance to flow has been mastered, the disciple incorporates the deep hissing sounds to train chi flow. Inhaling is silent, but exhalation is deliberate, tense and controlled. Inhaling lightens the body for aerial maneuvers, while exhaling drives power into each technique. Blocking is dispensed with, and parries or simple strikes substituted. At this point, novice and advanced student show very little in common. On the highest level, an opponent is allowed to tire himself out, evasion becoming the Dragon's key defense. Qi control is highly developed, and the degree to which the body must be moved to redirect or avoid impact is under greater control. The forms that constitute this system are divided by complexity into three categories, and are enumerated below: *Basic 16 Movements/Holes () Passing Bridge Three Times () Fierce Tiger Leaping Over Wall () Rescue Master From Single Side () Single Sword and Mount () Press and Hit from Four Sides () Eagle Claw () Bridge Smashing () *Intermediate Touch Bridge (introduces sticking hands) () Venomous Snake Moves Tongue () Hua King's Fist () Standing Five-Form () Cross Standing Five-Form Turn to Hook and Hit Five Horses Returning to Stable () *Advanced Plum Flower Punch () Seven Ways of Plum Flower Punch () In each form, one is taught to \\"ride the wind\\", a phrase which in large part means follow rather than lead. Provide no opening without first letting your opponent open. Unlike Crane, which also relies heavily upon evasion as a tactic, the Dragon evades primarily by rotation of upper or lower torso with straight and zig-zag stance movements, while the Crane stylist hops frequently to reposition the entire body. Both styles employ pinpoint strikes to vulnerable meridian targets, but dragon also heavily uses tiger-like punches and clawing techniques, snake-like stance shifts, and leopard-like hit and run strikes to weaken a physically superior adversary. Southern Dragon kung fu also regularly employs low sweeping techniques, but these are not unique; most senior stylists of any kung fu system use these on a weakened adversary. Techniques Overview The southern dragon stylist relies on a variety of fighting techniques that can be employed for a wide range of needs. The style uses techniques that can cripple or kill an opponent if the need arises or it can be used simply to control a minor street fighting situation. Lung Ying (Dragon form) focuses mainly on powerful, short to medium range attacks, as is common among southern Chinese styles of kung fu. Gripping techniques and extensive use of forearms typify the art. The style was created as an aggressive combat art and operates under the basic assumption that you are trying to either disable your opponent to the point that they are no longer a threat in battle, or kill them, though these are not by any means the only options a Lung Ying practitioner has. As such Lung Ying employs a large number of techniques to damage the opponent's joints either through joint manipulation or direct striking; nullify the opponent's defenses either through breaking their stance or compromising their guard, and thus their ability to defend; and others. Like most southern style kung fu, it has initially limited kicks and jumps (they are common in the advanced levels) and consisted mainly of fist, palm and clawing techniques. Power generated from the waist using soft hard jin (see neijin and waijin). Lung Ying training also involves an extensive amount of iron body training. Hardening the forearms especially is considered essential to the style as it makes such extensive use of them. Depending on the particular school any of a fairly large pool of traditional training methods will be used to toughen the body. Three, five and seven star conditioning drills, pea buckets, weighted ropes, sand bags, and striking poles are all common in Lung Ying schools. It really isn't possible to separate Lung Ying conditioning from its methods, the two work hand in hand, each needing the other to be completely effective. Basics The Southern Dragon Kung Fu practitioner typically attacks with winding low yang; that is, powerful and quick movements. For example, when striking with the fist, more power can be exerted when the movement originates from the feet, is guided by the waist, flows through the body, and exits through the fist. Foot work In Southern Dragon style, leg work is characterized by a zig- zag motion that mimics the imagined movement of the mythical Chinese dragon. This also allows one to use floating, spitting, swallowing and sinking movements which are very important in generating power and stability, making your body calm and relaxed. Though the Lung Ying footwork pool is deep, it generally centers on two basic types of stepping. The first is \\"Zig Zag\\" stepping (dragon stepping). Basically with each step forward, the rear foot moves forward and becomes the forward foot. However, the step is not taken directly forward but basically follows the angle the front foot is turned at (about 33 degrees). This has the effect of moving the Lung Ying practitioner forward and off to an angle while offering some protection to the groin from attack. This type of stepping allows a Lung Ying practitioner to press his opponent (usually used before the opponent's center has been taken) while launching attacks from angles that are difficult for the opponent to defend. The Lung Ying practitioner seems to be constantly moving into an uncomfortable range and at an angle that forces their opponent to reposition their whole body to defend against, or else torque their torso around thus breaking their structure and disconnecting them from the power generation machinery of their lower body. The second basic type of stepping is Bik Bo stepping, or press stepping. In this method the front foot moves forward and the rear foot drags up to get back to the basic position. This stepping generally covers less distance than the dragon stepping, and is used to press the opponent. It will frequently be used once the Lung Ying practitioner has begun to press their attack in earnest or is exploiting some advantage. There are specific methods for stretching this footwork out addressed in various forms. One of the primary purposes of this footwork is to keep the Lung Ying practitioner \\"on top of\\" their opponent and in attacking range. Also, this type of stepping is heavily used in various stance breaking methods. Southern Dragon style motto :\\"Control yourself, let others do what they will. :This does not mean you are weak. :Control your heart, obey the principles of life. :This does not mean others are strong\\". Codes of Southern Dragon style *The seeds were first planted from Haufeng; the essence was gained later at Haushou *Restrain one's self and yield to others not because one is weak, but to uphold the ethical Tao and let the others have their claim. Four rules of the Southern Dragons #Focus to train and condition the body. #Be righteous and uphold your honor. #Respect your parents, honor your teacher. #Treat others with honesty, treat your friends with loyalty. Dragon style in popular culture *The 2010 show A Fistful of Stances has used this in episode 22 and 23. *The style was performed by Jackie Chan in his films Dragon Lord and Dragon Fist. *Dragon is one of the three fighting styles utilized by the character Sub-Zero in the Mortal Kombat series (as seen in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance and Mortal Kombat: Deception) and the character Jarek in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. It is also Liu Kang's grapple style in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks. Onaga, the boss character of Mortal Kombat: Deception, also uses a fighting style named Dragon. However, this is not the true Dragon style (as used by Sub-Zero); it is simply named as such due to Onaga being an actual dragon. *The Dragon fighting style is used at times by the police officer Lei Wulong in Tekken. These are all examples of Běilóngquán (Northern Dragon Fist), rather than the aforementioned Southern Dragon Fist (Nánlóngquán).

Seventy miles of the river between Lake Tenkiller and the Arkansas border, flowing through the Cookson Hills, have been supervised by the Oklahoma Scenic Rivers Commission, currently headed by Ed Fite since 1970. Description The spring-fed river rises in the Ozark Mountains in the northwest corner of Arkansas, in Washington County southwest of Fayetteville, near the communities of Hogeye and Onda. The stream flows north parallel to Arkansas Highway 265 then turns northwest passing under U.S. Route 62 northeast of Prairie Grove. It continues north-northwest passing under Arkansas Highway 16 west of Savoy and forming a portion of the east boundary of the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest. The stream flows through a portion of the national forest and enters Benton County. Near Robinson the stream flows under U.S. Route 412 and turns to the west paralleling that route. It passes north of Pedro then under Route 412 again and turns to the southwest. It passes under Arkansas 16 again and Arkansas Highway 59 to the southeast of Siloam Springs. The stream leaves Arkansas at the southwest corner of Benton County and enters Lake Frances in Oklahoma. It flows west into northeast Oklahoma, then southwest and south through the mountains of eastern Oklahoma, past Scraper and Tahlequah. South of Tahlequah, it passes through the reservoir Tenkiller Ferry Lake. It joins the Arkansas River downstream of Gore and upstream of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, approximately southeast of Muskogee. Together with its tributary streams, it has a drainage area of . The town of Tahlequah on its banks was the western terminus of the Trail of Tears. The river is a major source of tourism in the area. In 1999, it was estimated to have brought in approximately 500,000 tourists and $9 million to the Oklahoma section of the river. The upper section and its tributaries, Flint Creek and the Baron Fork, became a designated Scenic River under the Oklahoma Scenic Rivers Act in 1977. and home to many native species of bass with spring runs of white bass. It is a popular summertime destination for floaters. The lower section, below Tenkiller Dam, is a designated year-round trout stream, stocked with Rainbow and Brown Trout. The state record rainbow trout was caught in the cold tailwater of the dam. Environmental issues The river has been the source of a long-running controversy between the two states, with Oklahoma blaming Arkansas for pollution in the river, most notoriously phosphorus contamination by sewage and poultry farm runoff. In 1987, wastewater discharge by the city of Fayetteville, Arkansas was identified as the source of a heavy load of phosphorus. Oklahoma sued Arkansas to stop this discharge. The suit went to the U. S. Supreme Court in 1992, which ruled that the upstream state must enforce the water quality rules of the downstream state. In 2002, Oklahoma became the first state to use a numerical water quality standard for phosphorus. The standard for scenic rivers was set at 0.037 mg/L In December 2003, an agreement was reached between the two states, with Arkansas agreeing to reduce phosphorus output from its waste water treatment plants by 75% over the next ten years, although it does not address poultry-farm runoff. In 1996, a report demonstrated that nutrient-fed algae was endangering Lake Tenkiller, which is located on the lower Illinois. The report stated that phosphorus content in the river should be reduced by 40 percent to prevent lake water quality from declining further and by 80 percent to return the quality to its original condition.Krehbiel, Randy. \\"The Illinois River is cleaner, but the hard work has just begun. Tulsa World. October 20, 2015. Accessed October 21, 2017. The situation appears to have improved. The Oklahoma Water Resources Board reported in 2015, that phosphorus levels have been declining in the Illinois River and its tributaries on the Oklahoma side of the state line. On October 1, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued for public comment the water quality model for the Illinois River. The J. T. Nickel Family Nature and Wildlife Preserve is the largest nature preserve near the river. It is located near the east bank of the Illinois River near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Elk were reintroduced into the preserve in 2005. This species had been missing from the Cookson Hills area for at least 150 years.\\"OKLAHOMA: J.T.

She is thought to be the subject of a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Early life Clairmont was born in 1798 in Brislington, near Bristol, the second child and only daughter of Mary Jane Vial Clairmont. Throughout her childhood, she was known as \\"Jane\\". In 2010 the identity of her father was discovered to be John Lethbridge (1746–1815, after 1804 Sir John Lethbridge, 1st Baronet) of Sandhill Park, near Taunton in Somerset. Her mother had identified him as a \\"Charles Clairmont\\", adopting the name Clairmont for herself and her children, to disguise their illegitimacy. It appears that the father of her first child, Charles, was Charles Abram Marc Gaulis, \\"a merchant and member of a prominent Swiss family, whom she met in Cadiz\\". In December 1801, when Clairmont was three years old, her mother married a neighbour, the writer and philosopher William Godwin. This brought her two stepsisters: Godwin's daughter Mary (later Mary Shelley), only eight months her senior, and his stepdaughter Fanny Imlay, a couple of years older. Both were the daughters of Mary Wollstonecraft, who had died four years before, but whose presence continued to be felt in the household. The new couple soon became the parents of a son, Claire's youngest sibling. All five children were influenced by Godwin's radical anarchist philosophical beliefs. Both parents were well-educated and they co-wrote children's primers on Biblical and classical history, published the Juvenile Library, and ran a bookshop. Godwin encouraged all of his children to read widely and give lectures from early childhood.McDowell, \\"Books: Women's Work\\". Mary Jane Clairmont was a sharp-tongued woman who often quarrelled with Godwin and favoured her own children over her husband's daughters. She contrived to send her volatile and emotionally intense daughter to boarding school for a time, thus providing her with more formal education than her stepsisters. Unlike Mary, Claire Clairmont was fluent in French as a teenager; later she was credited with fluency in five languages. Despite their different treatment, the girls grew close and remained in contact for the rest of their lives. Byron Lord Byron At sixteen Clairmont was a lively, voluptuous brunette with a good singing voice and a hunger for recognition. Her home life had become increasingly tense as her stepfather William Godwin sank deeper into debt and her mother's relations with Godwin's daughter Mary became more strained. Clairmont aided her stepsister's clandestine meetings with Percy Bysshe Shelley, who had professed a belief in free love and soon left his own wife, Harriet, and two small children to be with Mary. When Mary ran away with Shelley in July 1814, Clairmont went with them. Clairmont's mother traced the group to an inn in Calais but could not make Clairmont go home with her. Godwin needed the financial assistance that the aristocratic Shelley could provide. Clairmont remained in the Shelley household in their wanderings across Europe. The three young people traipsed across war-torn France and into Switzerland, fancying themselves like characters in a romantic novel, as Mary Shelley later recalled, but always reading widely, writing, and discussing the creative process. On the journey, Clairmont read Rousseau, Shakespeare, and the works of Mary's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft. \\"What shall poor Cordelia do – Love & be silent,\\" Clairmont wrote in her journal while reading King Lear. \\"Oh [th]is is true – Real Love will never [sh]ew itself to the eye of broad day – it courts the secret glades.\\" Clairmont's emotions were so stirred by Cordelia that she had one of her \\"horrors\\", a hysterical fit, Mary Shelley recorded in her own journal entry for the same day. Clairmont, who was surrounded by poets and writers, also made her own literary attempts. During the summer of 1814, she started a story titled The Idiot, which has since been lost. In 1817–18, she wrote a book which Percy Bysshe Shelley tried without success to have published.Booth, pp. 67–70. Although Clairmont lacked the literary talent of her stepsister and brother-in-law, she always longed to take centre stage. It was during this period that she changed her name from \\"Jane\\" to first \\"Clara\\" and finally the more romantic-sounding \\"Claire\\". Any romantic designs Clairmont might have had on Shelley were frustrated initially, but she did bring the Shelleys into contact with Lord Byron, with whom she entered into an affair before he left England in 1816 to live abroad. (A year marked by agricultural failures and widespread European famine, but also of significant literary advances as the Godwin-Shelley-Byron circle holed up indoors, 1816 would later be known as the \\"year without a summer\\".) Clairmont hoped to become a writer or an actress and wrote to Byron asking for \\"career advice\\" in March 1816, when she was almost 18. Byron was a director at the Drury Lane Theatre. Clairmont later followed up her letters with visits, sometimes bringing Mary, whom she seemed to suggest Byron might also find attractive. \\"Do you know I cannot talk to you when I see you? I am so awkward and only feel inclined to take a little stool and sit at your feet,\\" Clairmont wrote to Byron. She \\"bombarded him with passionate daily communiques\\" telling him he need only accept \\"that which it has long been the passionate wish of my heart to give you\\".Eisler, p. 504. She arranged for them to meet at a country inn. Byron, in a depressed state after the breakup of his marriage to Annabella Milbanke and the scandal over his relationship with his half-sister Augusta Leigh, made it very clear to Clairmont before he left that she would not be a part of his life. But she was determined to change his mind. She convinced Mary and Percy Shelley that they should follow Byron to Switzerland, where they met him and his personal physician, John William Polidori, at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva. It is unknown whether Clairmont knew she was pregnant with Byron's child at the commencement of the trip, but it soon became apparent to both her travelling companions and to Byron not long after their arrival at his door. At first he maintained his refusal of Clairmont's companionship and allowed her to be in his presence only in the company of the Shelleys; later, they resumed their sexual relationship for a time in Switzerland. Clairmont and Mary also made fair copies of Byron's current work- in-progress, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.Eisler, p. 519. Clairmont was the only lover, other than Caroline Lamb, whom Byron referred to as a \\"little fiend\\".Eisler, p. 515. Confessing the affair in a letter to his half-sister Augusta Leigh, Byron wrote: > What could I do? – a foolish girl – in spite of all I could say or do – > would come after me – or rather went before me – for I found her here... I > could not exactly play the Stoic with a woman – who had scrambled eight > hundred miles to unphilosophize me.\\"Eisler, p. 519. He referred to her also in the following manner, in a letter to Douglas Kinnaird (20 January 1817): > You know – & I believe saw once that odd-headed girl [Claire Clairmont]– who > introduced herself to me shortly before I left England – but you do not know > – that I found her with Shelley and her sister at Geneva – I never loved her > nor pretended to love her – but a man is a man – & if a girl of eighteen > comes prancing to you at all hours of the night – there is but one way – the > suite of all this is that she was with child – & returned to England to > assist in peopling that desolate island... This comes of \\"putting it about\\" > (as Jackson calls it) & be dammed to it – and thus people come into the > world. Clairmont would later say that her relationship with Byron had given her only a few minutes of pleasure, but a lifetime of trouble. Birth of Allegra The group left Byron in Switzerland at the end of the summer and returned to England. Clairmont took up residence in Bath and in January 1817 she gave birth to a daughter, Alba, whose name was eventually changed to Allegra. Throughout the pregnancy, Clairmont had written long letters to Byron, pleading for his attention and a promise to care for her and the baby, sometimes making fun of his friends, reminding him how much he had enjoyed making love to her, and sometimes threatening suicide. Byron, who by this time hated her, ignored the letters. The following year, Clairmont and the Shelleys left England and journeyed once more to Byron, who now resided in Italy. Clairmont felt that the future Byron could provide for their daughter would be greater than any she herself would be able to grant the child and, therefore, wished to deliver Allegra into his care. Upon arriving in Italy, Clairmont was again refused by Byron. He arranged to have Allegra delivered to his house in Venice and agreed to raise the child on the condition that Clairmont keep her distance from him. Clairmont reluctantly gave Allegra over to Byron. Percy Bysshe Shelley Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1819 Clairmont may have been sexually involved with Percy Bysshe Shelley at different periods,Eisler, p. 516. though Clairmont's biographers, Gittings and Manton, find no hard evidence. Their friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg joked about \\"Shelley and his two wives\\", Mary and Claire, a remark that Clairmont recorded in her own journal. Clairmont was also entirely in sympathy, more so than Mary, with Shelley's theories about free love, communal living, and the right of a woman to choose her own lovers and initiate sexual contact outside marriage. She seemed to conceive of love as a \\"triangle\\" and enjoyed being the third. She had also formed a close friendship with Shelley, who called her \\"my sweet child\\" and inspired and fed off his work. Mary Shelley's early journals record several times when Clairmont and Shelley shared visions of Gothic horror and let their imaginings take flight, stirring each others' emotions to the point of hysteria and nightmares.Fisch, Mellor, and Schor, p. 45. In October 1814, Shelley deliberately frightened Clairmont by assuming a particularly sinister and horrifying facial expression. \\"How horribly you look... Take your eyes off!\\" she cried. She was put to bed after yet another of her \\"horrors\\". Shelley described her expression to Mary as \\"distorted most unnaturally by horrible dismay\\". In the autumn of 1814, Clairmont and Shelley also discussed forming \\"an association of philosophical people\\" and Clairmont's conception of an idealized community in which women were the ones in charge. Shelley's poem \\"To Constantia, Singing\\" is thought to be about her: Mary Shelley revised this poem, completely altering the first two stanzas, when she included it in a posthumous collection of Shelley's works published in 1824. In Shelley's \\"Epipsychidion\\", some scholars believe that he is addressing Clairmont as his:Eisler, p. 519. At the time Shelley wrote the poem, in Pisa, Clairmont was living in Florence, and the lines may reveal how much he missed her.Gittings and Manton, p. 58. Mary Shelley, about 1820 It has occasionally been suggested that Clairmont was also the mother of a daughter fathered by Percy Shelley. The possibility goes back to the accusation by Shelley's servants, Elise and Paolo Foggi, that Clairmont gave birth to Shelley's baby during a stay in Naples, where, on 27 February 1819, Shelley registered a baby named Elena Adelaide Shelley as having been born on 27 December 1818. The registrar recorded her as the daughter of Percy Shelley and \\"Maria\\" or \\"Marina Padurin\\" (possibly an Italian mispronunciation of \\"Mary Godwin\\"), and she was baptized the same day as the lawfully begotten child of Percy Shelley and Mary Godwin. It is, however, almost impossible that Mary Shelley was the mother, and this has given rise to several theories, including that the child was indeed Clairmont's.Seymour, p. 221; Holmes, pp, 460–474; Bieri, pp. 103–112; Gittings and Manton, p. 46; Journals of Mary Shelley, pp. 249–50 n3. Among several theories, some scholars have speculated she was Elise Foggi, a nursemaid of the Shelley family; others believe Elena's mother was Clairmont. Thomas Medwin, a cousin of Shelley, claimed the mother was an unnamed woman with whom Shelley had an affair. It has also been proposed that Shelley adopted a local child as his own, or that the child was Elise Foggi's by Byron. Clairmont herself had ascended Mount Vesuvius, carried on a palanquin, on 16 December 1818, only nine days before the date given for the birth of Elena.Seymour, p. 224. Though, since the question arises of why Shelley waited two months before registering the baby, the birth date may not be reliable. It may be significant, however, that Clairmont was taken ill at about the same time – according to Mary Shelley's journal she was ill on 27 December – and that her journal of June 1818 to early March 1819 has been lost.Gittings and Manton, p. 45; Bieri, p. 104. Bieri calls the loss of the journal \\"significant and probably not accidental\\" and part of a situation in which \\"the Shelley family was concealing much that occurred in Naples\\". In a letter to Isabella Hoppner of 10 August 1821, Mary Shelley, however, stated emphatically that \\"Claire had no child\\". She also insisted: > I am perfectly convinced in my own mind that Shelley never had an improper > connexion [sic] with Claire ... we lived in lodgings where I had momentary > entrance into every room and such a thing could not have passed unknown to > me ... I do remember that Claire did keep to her bed there for two days – > but I attended on her – I saw the physician – her illness was one that she > had been accustomed to for years – and the same remedies were employed as I > had before ministered to her in England.Seymour, p. 224; Mary Shelley, > Letter to Isabella Hoppner, Selected Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, > pp. 76–77. The infant Elena was placed with foster parents and later died on 10 June 1820. Byron believed the rumors about Elena and used them as one more reason not to let Clairmont influence Allegra.Eisler, p. 668. Death of Allegra Clara Allegra Byron, about 1822 Clairmont was granted only a few brief visits with her daughter after surrendering her to Byron. When Byron arranged to place her in a Capuchin convent in Bagnacavallo, Italy, Clairmont was outraged. In 1821, she wrote Byron a letter accusing him of breaking his promise that their daughter would never be apart from one of her parents. She felt that the physical conditions in convents were unhealthy and the education provided was poor and was responsible for \\"the state of ignorance & profligacy of Italian women, all pupils of Convents. They are bad wives & most unnatural mothers, licentious & ignorant they are the dishonour & unhappiness of society.... This step will procure to you an innumerable addition of enemies & of blame.\\"Eisler, pp. 690–691. By March 1822, it had been two years since she had seen her daughter. She plotted to kidnap Allegra from the convent and asked Shelley to forge a letter of permission from Byron. Shelley refused her request. Byron's seemingly callous treatment of the child was further vilified when Allegra died there at age five from a fever some scholars identify as typhus and others speculate was a malarial-type fever. Clairmont held Byron entirely responsible for the loss of their daughter and hated him for the rest of her life. Shelley's death followed only two months later. Later life Edward John Trelawny Tomb of Claire Clairmont at Cimitero della Misericordia dell'Antella, Florence, Italy Shortly after Clairmont had introduced Shelley to Byron, she met Edward John Trelawny, who was to play a major role in the short remaining lives of both poets. After Shelley's death, Trelawny sent her love letters from Florence pleading with her to marry him, but she was not interested.Eisler, p. 724. Still, she remained in contact with him the rest of her long life.Gittings and Manton, p. 71. Clairmont wrote to Mary Shelley: \\"He [Trelawny] likes a turbid and troubled life; I a quiet one; he is full of fine feeling and has no principles; I am full of fine principles but never had a feeling (in my life).\\" Devastated after Shelley's death, Mary returned to England. She paid for Clairmont to travel to her brother's home in Vienna where she stayed for a year, before relocating to Russia, where she worked as a governess from 1825 to 1828. The people she worked for treated her almost as a member of the family. Still, what Clairmont longed for most of all was privacy and peace and quiet, as she complained in letters to Mary Shelley. Two Russian men she met commented on her general disdain for the male sex; irritated by their assumption that since she was always falling in love, she would return their affections if they flirted with her, Clairmont joked in a letter to Mary Shelley that perhaps she should fall in love with both of them at once and prove them wrong. She returned to England in 1828, but remained there only a short while before departing for Dresden, where she was employed as a companion and housekeeper. Scholar Bradford A. Booth suggested in 1938 that Clairmont, driven by a need for money, might have been the true author of most of The Pole, an 1830 short story that appeared in the magazine The Court Assembly and Belle Assemblée as by \\"The Author of Frankenstein\\". Unlike Mary Shelley, Clairmont was familiar with the Polish used in the story. At one point, she thought of writing a book about the dangers that might result from \\"erroneous opinions\\" about the relations between men and women, using examples from the lives of Shelley and Byron. She did not make many literary attempts, as she explained to her friend Jane Williams: > But in our family, if you cannot write an epic or novel, that by its > originality knocks all other novels on the head, you are a despicable > creature, not worth acknowledging.Booth, pp. 67–70. Clairmont returned to England in 1836, the year William Godwin died, and worked as a music teacher. She cared for her mother when she was dying. In 1841, after Mary Jane Godwin's death, Clairmont moved to Pisa, where she lived with Margaret King (officially Lady Margaret Mount Cashell but known as Mrs Mason), an old pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft. She lived in Paris for a time in the 1840s. Percy Shelley had left her £12,000 in his will, which she finally received in 1844. She carried on a sometimes turbulent, bitter correspondence with her stepsister, until Mary died in 1851. Clairmont converted to Catholicism, despite having hated the religion earlier in her life. She moved to Florence in 1870 and lived there in an expatriate colony with her niece, Paulina. She was also close to Paulina's brother Wilhelm Gaulis Clairmont, the only other surviving child of her brother Charles. She considered making her home with him and financially supported some of his endeavours, for example with £500 towards the purchase of a farm. Clairmont also clung to memorabilia of Percy Shelley. The Aspern Papers by Henry James is based on the narrator's attempts to gain ownership of these items. Clairmont died in Florence on 19 March 1879, at the age of eighty. Clairmont outlived all the members of Shelley's circle, except Trelawny and Jane Williams. In popular culture Clairmont was portrayed by Myriam Cyr in the 1986 Ken Russell film Gothic. She was portrayed by Elizabeth Hurley in the Goya Award-winning 1988 Spanish film Rowing with the Wind, by Laura Dern in Haunted Summer (1988), and by Bel Powley in Mary Shelley (2017). All four films focus on the 1816 trip to Switzerland, during which Clairmont aimed to reunite with Byron, and Mary Shelley began writing Frankenstein. Clairmont was depicted in a special edition of the comic book The Wicked + The Divine, as an incarnation of the goddess Inanna and a member of the 1830s Pantheon. Clairmont was included as a member of the household in the eighth episode of Season 12 of Doctor Who (\\"The Haunting of Villa Diodati\\",The Haunting of Villa Diodati) which drew on the May 1816 visit of Clairmont, Percy Shelley and Mary Godwin to Byron's Swiss villa.Mary Shelley#Lake Geneva and Frankenstein.

The effect is important in applications where high direct current densities are used, such as in microelectronics and related structures. As the structure size in electronics such as integrated circuits (ICs) decreases, the practical significance of this effect increases.  History  The phenomenon of electromigration has been known for over 100 years, having been discovered by the French scientist Gerardin. The topic first became of practical interest during the late 1960s when packaged ICs first appeared. The earliest commercially available ICs failed in a mere three weeks of use from runaway electromigration, which led to a major industry effort to correct this problem. The first observation of electromigration in thin films was made by I. Blech.I. Blech: Electromigration in Thin Aluminum Films on Titanium Nitride. Journal of Applied Physics, Vol 47, pp. 1203-1208, April 1976. Research in this field was pioneered by a number of investigators throughout the fledgling semiconductor industry. One of the most important engineering studies was performed by Jim Black of Motorola, after whom Black's equation is named.J.R. Black: Electromigration - A Brief Survey and Some Recent Results. IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, Vol. ED-16 (No. 4), pp. 338-347, April 1969. At the time, the metal interconnects in ICs were still about 10 micrometres wide. Currently interconnects are only hundreds to tens of nanometers in width, making research in electromigration increasingly important.  Practical implications of electromigration  thumb SEM image of a failure caused by electromigration in a copper interconnect. The passivation has been removed by reactive ion etching and hydrofluoric acid Electromigration decreases the reliability of chips (integrated circuits (ICs)). It can cause the eventual loss of connections or failure of a circuit. Since reliability is critically important for space travel, military purposes, anti-lock braking systems, medical equipment like Automated External Defibrillators and is even important for personal computers or home entertainment systems, the reliability of chips (ICs) is a major focus of research efforts. Due to difficulty of testing under real conditions, Black's equation is used to predict the life span of integrated circuits. To use Black's equation, the component is put through high temperature operating life (HTOL) testing. The component's expected life span under real conditions is extrapolated from data gathered during the testing. Although electromigration damage ultimately results in failure of the affected IC, the first symptoms are intermittent glitches, and are quite challenging to diagnose. As some interconnects fail before others, the circuit exhibits seemingly random errors, which may be indistinguishable from other failure mechanisms (such as electrostatic discharge damage). In a laboratory setting, electromigration failure is readily imaged with an electron microscope, as interconnect erosion leaves telltale visual markers on the metal layers of the IC. With increasing miniaturization, the probability of failure due to electromigration increases in VLSI and ULSI circuits because both the power density and the current density increase. Specifically, line widths will continue to decrease over time, as will wire cross-sectional areas. Currents are also reduced due to lower supply voltages and shrinking gate capacitances. However, as current reduction is constrained by increasing frequencies, the more marked decrease in cross-sectional areas (compared to current reduction) will give rise to increased current densities in ICs going forward.J. Lienig, M. Thiele: \\"The Pressing Need for Electromigration-Aware Physical Design \\" (Download paper), Proc. of the Int. Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD) 2018, pp. 144–151, March 2018 In advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, copper has replaced aluminium as the interconnect material of choice. Despite its greater fragility in the fabrication process, copper is preferred for its superior conductivity. It is also intrinsically less susceptible to electromigration. However, electromigration (EM) continues to be an ever-present challenge to device fabrication, and therefore the EM research for copper interconnects is ongoing (though a relatively new field). In modern consumer electronic devices, ICs rarely fail due to electromigration effects. This is because proper semiconductor design practices incorporate the effects of electromigration into the IC's layout. Nearly all IC design houses use automated EDA tools to check and correct electromigration problems at the transistor layout-level. When operated within the manufacturer's specified temperature and voltage range, a properly designed IC device is more likely to fail from other (environmental) causes, such as cumulative damage from gamma- ray bombardment. Nevertheless, there have been documented cases of product failures due to electromigration. In the late 1980s, one line of Western Digital's desktop drives suffered widespread, predictable failure 12–18 months after field usage. Using forensic analysis of the returned bad units, engineers identified improper design-rules in a third-party supplier's IC controller. By replacing the bad component with that of a different supplier, WD was able to correct the flaw, but not before significant damage to the company's reputation. Electromigration due to poor fabrication processes was a significant cause of IC failures on Commodore's home computers during the 1980s. During 1983, the Commodore 64 computer for a time had a nearly 50% customer return rate. Electromigration can be a cause of degradation in some power semiconductor devices such as low voltage power MOSFETs, in which the lateral current through the source contact metallisation (often aluminium) can reach the critical current densities during overload conditions. The degradation of the aluminium layer causes an increase in on-state resistance, and can eventually lead to complete failure.  Fundamentals  The material properties of the metal interconnects have a strong influence on the life span. The characteristics are predominantly the composition of the metal alloy and the dimensions of the conductor. The shape of the conductor, the crystallographic orientation of the grains in the metal, procedures for the layer deposition, heat treatment or annealing, characteristics of the passivation and the interface to other materials also affect the durability of the interconnects. There are also grave differences with time dependent current: direct current or different alternating current waveforms cause different effects.  Forces on ions in an electrical field  Two forces affect ionized atoms in a conductor: 1) The direct electrostatic force Fe, as a result of the electric field, which has the same direction as the electric field, and 2) The force from the exchange of momentum with other charge carriers Fp, toward the flow of charge carriers, is in the opposite direction of the electric field. In metallic conductors Fp is caused by a so-called \\"electron wind\\" or \\"ion wind\\". The resulting force Fres on an activated ion in the electrical field is :F_{res}=F_e-F_p=q\\\\cdot Z^*\\\\cdot E=q\\\\cdot Z^*\\\\cdot j\\\\cdot \\\\rho Electromigration occurs when some of the momentum of a moving electron is transferred to a nearby activated ion. This causes the ion to move from its original position. Over time this force knocks a significant number of atoms far from their original positions. A break or gap can develop in the conducting material, preventing the flow of electricity. In narrow interconnect conductors, such as those linking transistors and other components in integrated circuits, this is known as a void or internal failure (open circuit). Electromigration can also cause the atoms of a conductor to pile up and drift toward other nearby conductors, creating an unintended electrical connection known as a hillock failure or whisker failure (short circuit). Both of these situations can lead to a malfunction of the circuit.  Failure mechanisms   Diffusion mechanisms  In a homogeneous crystalline structure, because of the uniform lattice structure of the metal ions, there is hardly any momentum transfer between the conduction electrons and the metal ions. However, this symmetry does not exist at the grain boundaries and material interfaces, and so here momentum is transferred much more vigorously. Since the metal ions in these regions are bonded more weakly than in a regular crystal lattice, once the electron wind has reached a certain strength, atoms become separated from the grain boundaries and are transported in the direction of the current. This direction is also influenced by the grain boundary itself, because atoms tend to move along grain boundaries. Diffusion processes caused by electromigration can be divided into grain boundary diffusion, bulk diffusion and surface diffusion. In general, grain boundary diffusion is the major electromigration process in aluminum wires, whereas surface diffusion is dominant in copper interconnects.  Thermal effects  In an ideal conductor, where atoms are arranged in a perfect lattice structure, the electrons moving through it would experience no collisions and electromigration would not occur. In real conductors, defects in the lattice structure and the random thermal vibration of the atoms about their positions causes electrons to collide with the atoms and scatter, which is the source of electrical resistance (at least in metals; see electrical conduction). Normally, the amount of momentum imparted by the relatively low- mass electrons is not enough to permanently displace the atoms. However, in high-power situations (such as with the increasing current draw and decreasing wire sizes in modern VLSI microprocessors), if many electrons bombard the atoms with enough force to become significant, this will accelerate the process of electromigration by causing the atoms of the conductor to vibrate further from their ideal lattice positions, increasing the amount of electron scattering. High current density increases the number of electrons scattering against the atoms of the conductor, and hence the speed at which those atoms are displaced. In integrated circuits, electromigration does not occur in semiconductors directly, but in the metal interconnects deposited onto them (see semiconductor device fabrication). Electromigration is exacerbated by high current densities and the Joule heating of the conductor (see electrical resistance), and can lead to eventual failure of electrical components. Localized increase of current density is known as current crowding.  Balance of atom concentration  A governing equation which describes the atom concentration evolution throughout some interconnect segment, is the conventional mass balance (continuity) equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial N}{\\\\partial t} + abla\\\\cdot\\\\vec J = 0 where N(\\\\vec x, t) is the atom concentration at the point with a coordinates \\\\vec x=(x, y, z) at the moment of time t, and J is the total atomic flux at this location. The total atomic flux J is a combination of the fluxes caused by the different atom migration forces. The major forces are induced by the electric current, and by the gradients of temperature, mechanical stress and concentration. \\\\vec J = \\\\vec J_c + \\\\vec J_T + \\\\vec J_\\\\sigma + \\\\vec J_N. To define the fluxes mentioned above: : \\\\vec J_c = \\\\frac{NeZD\\\\rho}{kT}\\\\vec j. Here e is the electron charge, eZ is the effective charge of the migrating atom, \\\\rho the resistivity of the conductor where atom migration takes place, \\\\vec j is the local current density, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature. D(\\\\vec x, t) is the time and position dependent atom diffusivity. : \\\\vec J_T = -\\\\frac{NDQ}{kT^2} abla T. We use Q the heat of thermal diffusion. : \\\\vec J_\\\\sigma = \\\\frac{ND\\\\Omega}{kT} abla H here \\\\Omega=1/N_0 is the atomic volume and N_0 is initial atomic concentration, H=(\\\\sigma_{11}+\\\\sigma_{22}+\\\\sigma_{33})/3 is the hydrostatic stress and \\\\sigma_{11},\\\\sigma_{22},\\\\sigma_{33} are the components of principal stress. : \\\\vec J_N = -D abla N. Assuming a vacancy mechanism for atom diffusion we can express D as a function of the hydrostatic stress D = D_0\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Omega H - E_A}{kT}\\\\right) where E_A is the effective activation energy of the thermal diffusion of metal atoms. The vacancy concentration represents availability of empty lattice sites, which might be occupied by a migrating atom.  Electromigration-aware design   Electromigration reliability of a wire (Black's equation)  At the end of the 1960s J. R. Black developed an empirical model to estimate the MTTF (mean time to failure) of a wire, taking electromigration into consideration. Since then, the formula has gained popularity in the semiconductor industry:, Page 607, equation 24 :\\\\text{MTTF} = \\\\frac{A}{J^n} e^{\\\\frac{E_\\\\text{a}}{k T}}. Here A is a constant based on the cross-sectional area of the interconnect, J is the current density, E_\\\\text{a} is the activation energy (e.g. 0.7 eV for grain boundary diffusion in aluminum), k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in kelvins, and n a scaling factor (usually set to 2 according to Black). The temperature of the conductor appears in the exponent, i.e. it strongly affects the MTTF of the interconnect. For an interconnect of a given construction to remain reliable as the temperature rises, the current density within the conductor must be reduced. However, as interconnect technology advances at the nanometer scale, the validity of Black's equation becomes increasingly questionable.  Wire material  Historically, aluminium has been used as conductor in integrated circuits, due to its good adherence to substrate, good conductivity, and ability to form ohmic contacts with silicon. However, pure aluminium is susceptible to electromigration. Research shows that adding 2-4% of copper to aluminium increases resistance to electromigration about 50 times. The effect is attributed to the grain boundary segregation of copper, which greatly inhibits the diffusion of aluminium atoms across grain boundaries. Pure copper wires can withstand approximately five times more current density than aluminum wires while maintaining similar reliability requirements.J. Lienig: \\"Introduction to Electromigration-Aware Physical Design\\" (Download paper), Proc. of the Int. Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD) 2006, pp. 39–46, April 2006. This is mainly due to the higher electromigration activation energy levels of copper, caused by its superior electrical and thermal conductivity as well as its higher melting point. Further improvements can be achieved by alloying copper with about 1% palladium which inhibits diffusion of copper atoms along grain boundaries in the same way as the addition of copper to aluminium interconnect.  Bamboo structure and metal slotting  A wider wire results in smaller current density and, hence, less likelihood of electromigration. Also, the metal grain size has influence; the smaller grains, the more grain boundaries and the higher likelihood of electromigration effects. However, if you reduce wire width to below the average grain size of the wire material, grain boundaries become \\"crosswise\\", more or less perpendicular to the length of the wire. The resulting structure resembles the joints in a stalk of bamboo. With such a structure, the resistance to electromigration increases, despite an increase in current density. This apparent contradiction is caused by the perpendicular position of the grain boundaries; the boundary diffusion factor is excluded, and material transport is correspondingly reduced.M. Zamri et al \\"In Situ TEM Observation of Fe-Included Carbon Nanofiber: Evolution of Structural and Electrical Properties in Field Emission Process\\", ACS Nano, 2012, 6 (11), pp 9567–9573. [Link http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn302889e] However, the maximum wire width possible for a bamboo structure is usually too narrow for signal lines of large-magnitude currents in analog circuits or for power supply lines. In these circumstances, slotted wires are often used, whereby rectangular holes are carved in the wires. Here, the widths of the individual metal structures in between the slots lie within the area of a bamboo structure, while the resulting total width of all the metal structures meets power requirements.  Blech length  There is a lower limit for the length of the interconnect that will allow higher current carrying capability. It is known as \\"Blech length\\". Any wire that has a length below this limit will have a stretched limit for Electromigration. Here, a mechanical stress buildup causes an atom back flow process which reduces or even compensates the effective material flow towards the anode. The Blech length must be considered when designing test structures to evaluate electromigration. This minimum length is typically some tens of microns for chip traces, and interconnections shorter than this are sometimes referred to as 'electromigration immortal'  Via arrangements and corner bends  Particular attention must be paid to vias and contact holes. The current carrying capacity of a via is much less than a metallic wire of same length. Hence multiple vias are often used, whereby the geometry of the via array is very significant: multiple vias must be organized such that the resulting current is distributed as evenly as possible through all the vias. Attention must also be paid to bends in interconnects. In particular, 90-degree corner bends must be avoided, since the current density in such bends is significantly higher than that in oblique angles (e.g., 135 degrees).  Electromigration in solder joints  The typical current density at which electromigration occurs in Cu or Al interconnects is 106 to 107 A/cm2. For solder joints (SnPb or SnAgCu lead-free) used in IC chips, however, electromigration occurs at much lower current densities, e.g. 104 A/cm2. It causes a net atom transport along the direction of electron flow. The atoms accumulate at the anode, while voids are generated at the cathode and back stress is induced during electromigration. The typical failure of a solder joint due to electromigration will occur at the cathode side. Due to the current crowding effect, voids form first at the corners of the solder joint. Then the voids extend and join to cause a failure. Electromigration also influences formation of intermetallic compounds, as the migration rates are a function of atomic mass.  Electromigration and technology computer aided design  The complete mathematical model describing electromigration consists of several partial differential equations (PDEs) C. Basaran, M. Lin, and H. Ye : A Thermodynamic Model for Electrical Current Induced Damage. International Journal of Solids and Structures, Vol 40, pp. 7315-7327, 2003. which need to be solved for three-dimensional geometrical domains representing segments of an interconnect structure. Such a mathematical model forms the basis for simulation of electromigration in modern technology computer aided design (TCAD) tools. Use of TCAD tools for detailed investigations of electromigration induced interconnect degradation is gaining importance. Results of TCAD studies in combination with reliability tests lead to modification of design rules improving the interconnect resistance to electromigration.  Electromigration due to IR drop noise of the on-chip power grid network/interconnect  The Electromigration degradation of the on-chip power grid network/interconnect depends on the IR drop noise of the power grid interconnect. The Electromigration-aware lifetime of the power grid interconnects as well as the chip decreases if the chip suffers from a high value of the IR drop noise. Electromigrated nanogaps  Electromigrated nanogaps are gaps formed in metallic bridges formed by the process of electromigration. A nanosized contact formed by electromigration acts like a waveguide for electrons. The nanocontact essentially acts like a one- dimensional wire with a conductance of G =2e^2/h. The current in a wire is the velocity of the electrons multiplied by the charge and number per unit length, I = veN/L or G=veN/LV. This gives a conductance of G=ve^2N/LE. In nano scale bridges the conductance falls in discrete steps of multiples of the quantum conductance G =2e^2/h. Electromigrated Nanogaps have shown great promise as electrodes in use in molecular scale electronics. Researchers have used feedback controlled electromigration to investigate the magnetoresistance of a quantum spin valve.

It is usually described as a minimization problem because the maximization of the real-valued function g(x) is equivalent to the minimization of the function f(x):=(-1)\\\\cdot g(x). Given a possibly nonlinear and non-convex continuous function f:\\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} with the global minima f^* and the set of all global minimizers X^* in \\\\Omega, the standard minimization problem can be given as :\\\\min_{x\\\\in\\\\Omega}f(x), that is, finding f^* and a global minimizer in X^*; where \\\\Omega is a (not necessarily convex) compact set defined by inequalities g_i(x)\\\\geqslant0, i=1,\\\\ldots,r. Global optimization is distinguished from local optimization by its focus on finding the minimum or maximum over the given set, as opposed to finding local minima or maxima. Finding an arbitrary local minimum is relatively straightforward by using classical local optimization methods. Finding the global minimum of a function is far more difficult: analytical methods are frequently not applicable, and the use of numerical solution strategies often leads to very hard challenges.  General theory  A recent approach to the global optimization problem is via minima distribution . In this work, a relationship between any continuous function f on a compact set \\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^n and its global minima f^* has been strictly established. As a typical case, it follows that : \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x)m^{(k)}(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x=f^*,~~\\\\textrm{where}~~m^{(k)}(x)=\\\\frac{e^{-kf(x)}}{\\\\int_\\\\Omega e^{-kf(x)} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x}; meanwhile, : \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty}m^{(k)}(x) =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{cl} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu(X^*)}, & x\\\\in X^*, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & x\\\\in\\\\Omega-X^*, \\\\end{array}\\\\right. where \\\\mu(X^*) is the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the set of minimizers X^*\\\\in\\\\Omega. And if f is not a constant on \\\\Omega, the monotonic relationship : \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x)m^{(k)}(x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x> \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x)m^{(k+\\\\Delta k)}(x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x>f^* holds for all k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} and \\\\Delta k>0, which implies a series of monotonous containment relationships, and one of them is, for example, : \\\\Omega\\\\supset D_f^{(k)}\\\\supset D_f^{(k+\\\\Delta k)}\\\\supset X^*, \\\\text{ where } D_f^{(k)}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\Omega : f(x)\\\\leqslant \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(t)m^{(k)}(t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. And we define a minima distribution to be a weak limit m_{f,\\\\Omega} such that the identity : \\\\int_\\\\Omega m_{f,\\\\Omega}(x)\\\\varphi(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\int_\\\\Omega m^{(k)}(x) \\\\varphi(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x holds for every smooth function \\\\varphi with compact support in \\\\Omega. Here are two immediate properties of m_{f,\\\\Omega}: : (1) m_{f,\\\\Omega} satisfies the identity \\\\int_\\\\Omega m_{f,\\\\Omega}(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x = 1. : (2) If f is continuous on \\\\Omega, then f^*=\\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x)m_{f,\\\\Omega}(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x. As a comparison, the well- known relationship between any differentiable convex function and its minima is strictly established by the gradient. If f is differentiable on a convex set D, then f is convex if and only if : f(y)\\\\geqslant f(x)+ abla f(x)(y-x),~~\\\\forall x,y\\\\in D; thus, abla f(x^*)=0 implies that f(y)\\\\geqslant f(x^*) holds for all y\\\\in D, i.e., x^* is a global minimizer of f on D.  Applications  Typical examples of global optimization applications include: * Protein structure prediction (minimize the energy/free energy function) * Computational phylogenetics (e.g., minimize the number of character transformations in the tree) * Traveling salesman problem and electrical circuit design (minimize the path length) * Chemical engineering (e.g., analyzing the Gibbs energy) * Safety verification, safety engineering (e.g., of mechanical structures, buildings) * Worst-case analysis * Mathematical problems (e.g., the Kepler conjecture) * Object packing (configuration design) problems * The starting point of several molecular dynamics simulations consists of an initial optimization of the energy of the system to be simulated. * Spin glasses * Calibration of radio propagation models and of many other models in the sciences and engineering * Curve fitting like non-linear least squares analysis and other generalizations, used in fitting model parameters to experimental data in chemistry, physics, biology, economics, finance, medicine, astronomy, engineering.  Deterministic methods  The most successful general exact strategies are: Inner and outer approximation In both of these strategies, the set over which a function is to be optimized is approximated by polyhedra. In inner approximation, the polyhedra are contained in the set, while in outer approximation, the polyhedra contain the set. Cutting-plane methods The cutting-plane method is an umbrella term for optimization methods which iteratively refine a feasible set or objective function by means of linear inequalities, termed cuts. Such procedures are popularly used to find integer solutions to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, as well as to solve general, not necessarily differentiable convex optimization problems. The use of cutting planes to solve MILP was introduced by Ralph E. Gomory and Václav Chvátal. Branch and bound methods Branch and bound (BB or B&B;) is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems. A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm. Interval methods Interval arithmetic, interval mathematics, interval analysis, or interval computation, is a method developed by mathematicians since the 1950s and 1960s as an approach to putting bounds on rounding errors and measurement errors in mathematical computation and thus developing numerical methods that yield reliable results. Interval arithmetic helps find reliable and guaranteed solutions to equations and optimization problems. Methods based on real algebraic geometry Real algebra is the part of algebra which is relevant to real algebraic (and semialgebraic) geometry. It is mostly concerned with the study of ordered fields and ordered rings (in particular real closed fields) and their applications to the study of positive polynomials and sums-of- squares of polynomials. It can be used in convex optimization  Stochastic methods  Several exact or inexact Monte-Carlo-based algorithms exist: Direct Monte-Carlo sampling In this method, random simulations are used to find an approximate solution. Example: The traveling salesman problem is what is called a conventional optimization problem. That is, all the facts (distances between each destination point) needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal is to run through the possible travel choices to come up with the one with the lowest total distance. However, let's assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path we would want to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to go from one point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account. Stochastic tunneling Stochastic tunneling (STUN) is an approach to global optimization based on the Monte Carlo method- sampling of the function to be objectively minimized in which the function is nonlinearly transformed to allow for easier tunneling among regions containing function minima. Easier tunneling allows for faster exploration of sample space and faster convergence to a good solution. Parallel tempering Parallel tempering, also known as replica exchange MCMC sampling, is a simulation method aimed at improving the dynamic properties of Monte Carlo method simulations of physical systems, and of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods more generally. The replica exchange method was originally devised by Swendsen,Swendsen RH and Wang JS (1986) Replica Monte Carlo simulation of spin glasses Physical Review Letters 57 : 2607–2609 then extended by GeyerC. J. Geyer, (1991) in Computing Science and Statistics, Proceedings of the 23rd Symposium on the Interface, American Statistical Association, New York, p. 156. and later developed, among others, by Giorgio Parisi.,David J. Earl and Michael W. Deem (2005) \\"Parallel tempering: Theory, applications, and new perspectives\\", Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 7, 3910 Sugita and Okamoto formulated a molecular dynamics version of parallel tempering: this is usually known as replica-exchange molecular dynamics or REMD. Essentially, one runs N copies of the system, randomly initialized, at different temperatures. Then, based on the Metropolis criterion one exchanges configurations at different temperatures. The idea of this method is to make configurations at high temperatures available to the simulations at low temperatures and vice versa. This results in a very robust ensemble which is able to sample both low and high energy configurations. In this way, thermodynamical properties such as the specific heat, which is in general not well computed in the canonical ensemble, can be computed with great precision. Heuristics and metaheuristics  :Main page: Metaheuristic Other approaches include heuristic strategies to search the search space in a more or less intelligent way, including: * Ant colony optimization (ACO) * Simulated annealing, a generic probabilistic metaheuristic * Tabu search, an extension of local search capable of escaping from local minima * Evolutionary algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms and evolution strategies) * Differential evolution, a method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality * Swarm-based optimization algorithms (e.g., particle swarm optimization, social cognitive optimization, multi-swarm optimization and ant colony optimization) * Memetic algorithms, combining global and local search strategies * Reactive search optimization (i.e. integration of sub-symbolic machine learning techniques into search heuristics) * Graduated optimization, a technique that attempts to solve a difficult optimization problem by initially solving a greatly simplified problem, and progressively transforming that problem (while optimizing) until it is equivalent to the difficult optimization problem.Hossein Mobahi, John W.

In the U.S., it premiered as a Sci Fi Pictures telefilm on the Sci Fi Channel. Plot A couple goes camping in the Scottish Highlands. The woman gives the man a silver letter opener as a present; shortly afterward they are killed in their tent by unseen assailants. Meanwhile, a soldier named Cooper runs through a forest in North Wales. He attacks his pursuers, but is overwhelmed and wrestled to the ground. It is revealed that Cooper is trying to join a special forces unit but fails when he refuses to shoot a dog in cold blood. He is returned to his unit by Captain Richard Ryan. Four weeks later, a squad of six British soldiers, including Cooper, are dropped into the Scottish Highlands to carry out a training exercise against a Special Air Service unit. The following morning, they find the SAS unit's savaged remains. A badly wounded Captain Ryan, the only survivor, makes cryptic references to what attacked them. The troops retreat when unseen assailants begin pursuing them. While retreating, Bruce is impaled by a tree branch, which kills him, and Sergeant Wells is attacked. He is rescued by Cooper and carried to a rural roadside where the group meets Megan, a zoologist who takes them to a lonely house belonging to an unknown family. The soldiers who remain are Wells, Cooper, Spoon, Joe, and Terry. As darkness falls, the house is surrounded by the attackers, who are revealed to be werewolves. The survivors try to get in the Land Rover but find it has been destroyed by the werewolves. The soldiers maintain a desperate defence against the creatures, believing that if they can make it to sunrise, the werewolves will revert to human form. Cooper and Megan treat Wells' wounds. After Terry is abducted and their ammunition runs short, they realize they will not last and decide to try to escape. Spoon creates a diversion while Joe steals a Land Rover from the garage. Joe drives up to the house door, but is then killed by a werewolf that was hiding in the back seat. Under interrogation, Ryan reveals that the government had sent him on a mission to capture a live werewolf, so that it could be studied and exploited as a weapon; Cooper's squad was supposed to be the bait. An enraged Wells and Cooper attempt to kill Ryan, but he transforms into a werewolf due to his wounds and escapes into the forest. It is then revealed that the unknown family of the house are the werewolves. The soldiers try blowing up the barn - where Megan told them the werewolves must be hiding - with petrol, gas canisters, matches, and the Land Rover. Once the structure has been destroyed, Megan reveals that not only were there no werewolves in the barn, but she is a werewolf, as well. She also reveals that she unlocked the back door to the house, allowing the other werewolves to get inside. Before she fully transforms, Wells shoots her in the head. He and Cooper run upstairs, while Spoon fights a werewolf in the kitchen. Using nearby surroundings to his advantage, he gains the upper hand but is eventually killed when a second werewolf intervenes. Wells and Cooper shoot through the floor upstairs to elude the werewolves, and drop into the kitchen, where they find Spoon's remains. As he begins to transform into a werewolf, Wells orders Cooper to take shelter in the cellar and gives him a roll of photographic film (which was in a flashgun camera used to stun the werewolves) to prove what has happened. The werewolves break into the kitchen and confront Wells as he cuts a gas line and blows up the house, killing himself and the werewolves. As the sun rises, Cooper attempts to leave, but the werewolf Ryan confronts him. After a brutal fight, Cooper stabs Ryan in the chest with the silver letter opener, weakening him enough to allow Cooper to shoot him in the head. Cooper and Megan's Border Collie, Sam, emerges from the cellar. Cooper's story, with photographs, is shown reported only in a sensationalist tabloid newspaper with title \\"Werewolves ate my platoon!\\", under the results of an England vs. Germany football match. Cast * Sean Pertwee as Sergeant Harry G. Wells * Kevin McKidd as Private Lawrence Cooper * Emma Cleasby as Megan * Liam Cunningham as Captain Richard Ryan * Darren Morfitt as Private Phil \\"Spoon\\" Witherspoon * Chris Robson as Private Joe Kirkley * Leslie Simpson as Private Terry Milburn * Thomas Lockyer as Corporal Bruce Campbell * Craig Conway as male camper * Tina Landini as female camper Production Development In 1995, director Neil Marshall pitched to co-producer Keith Bell his idea of a low-budget soldiers vs. werewolves film. The filmmakers were introduced to the Victor Film Company as a sales agent, who introduced them to producer Christopher Figg. The project was later taken to AFM, where producer David E. Allen became interested in the project after seeing artwork and the script. Production designer Simon Bowles created models of the house for Marshall to plan and structure where to set up cameras and where characters would run or climb onto the next set. For the exterior set of the house, only the front portion was built early on and is the only part used in the film. Dog Soldiers was produced by the Kismet Entertainment Group, the Noel Gay Motion Picture Company, the Victor Film Company, and the Carousel Picture Company with the support of the Luxembourg Film Fund. In addition to the credits in the infobox, the costume designer is Uli Simon, the casting directors are Jeremy Zimmerman and Andrea Clarke, the special makeup, animatronic and digital visual effects are by the company Image FX, and the physical-effects supervisor and stunt coordinator is Harry Wiessenhaan. In the United States, the film premiered as a Sci-Fi Pictures telefilm on the Sci-Fi Channel. official site (Sci-Fi Channel). Archived from the original on 5 June 2003 The film contains homages to H. G. Wells as well as the films The Evil Dead, Zulu, Aliens, The Matrix and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.Director, cast and crew commentary. Dog Soldiers (DVD). Pathe Film. Writing Marshall wrote the first draft in 1996. It took six years to refine the script and acquire financing. Marshall wanted the focus to be on the soldiers, with the creatures being an enemy that happens to be werewolves. Marshall wanted to avoid cliches about werewolf curses or \\"how awful it is to be a werewolf\\", which Marshall felt was a trope exhaustingly used in many werewolf films. Filming Principal photography was originally scouted and planned to commence in the Isle of Man due to its tax rebates but the idea fell through. Manitoba was later considered as a filming location due to tax reasons but the idea collapsed as well. The film was shot in Luxembourg due to tax deals and having access to crew and student facilities provided by a company based in Luxembourg. Snow affected the set occasionally, which delayed filming schedules. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Dog Soldiers holds an approval rating of 77%, based on 35 reviews, and an average rating of 6.84/10. It's consensus reads, \\"Frightening, funny, and packed with action, Dog Soldiers is well worth checking out for genre fans  and marks writer- director Neil Marshall as a talent to keep an eye on.\\" Awards In 2002, the film won the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film's Golden Raven, the festival's top award, as well as the audience prize, the Pegasus. Home media Dog Soldiers was released on DVD in the U.S. in November 2002 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. A Blu-ray edition (including a single-disc edition and a double-disc edition with a DVD copy) was released by First Look Studios on May 5, 2009, available only in the U.S. and Canada. Due to the low quality of the original Blu-ray transfer, Shout! Factory worked hand in hand with director Neil Marshall to create a brand-new Blu-ray transfer for Dog Soldiers in a release titled Dog Soldiers: Collector's Edition, which was released on June 23, 2015. It was a two-disc set including a brand-new Blu-ray and a DVD copy with a new cover. This edition is only available in the U.S. (Region A). However, the original negative wasn't located at the time of the making of this release, and Shout! Factory had to rely on two original cinema prints, whose visual qualities are limited. On March 14, 2019, with the original negative finally located, the German company Koch Media released the movie on video in a package including the movie, restored in 4K from the negative, on DVD, Blu-ray and UHD. Another 4K restoration was announced by Vertigo Releasing in 2020, with a digital release on October 12, 2020 and a limited edition Blu-ray release by Second Sight Films following in February 2021. Sequel Producer David E. Allen said in January 2004 that a sequel, Dog Soldiers: Fresh Meat, would begin a 35-day shoot that April in either Luxembourg or Canada with a budget of $5.5 million. Andy Armstrong, a second- unit director on films including Hellbound: Hellraiser II and Nightbreed, would direct from an Eric Miller script, with Allen and Brian Patrick O’Toole returning as producers. No casting was announced. Allen said the plot would involve Cooper being \\"picked up by an American team who, we find out, were the real opponents for the war games for Sgt. Wells' squad.\\" A year later, he elaborated that, \\"In the first film, it was a family who were the werewolves. In this one, it's an actual team of werewolves who are true military men. So even though they are now werewolves, they act like a trained military unit.\\" In January 2005, Michael J. Bassett was in talks to direct, but by July 2006, Rob Green, who previously directed the horror film The Bunker, was set to direct and said he and Miller had written a story in which \\"Some of the characters actually love being a werewolf because they are so powerful – the ultimate killing machine … [I]t's a fun spin on the traditional angle that being a werewolf is a curse which damns the person no matter what. We also have a very savage she-wolf in the climax who faces against the leader of the pack of Dog Soldiers.\\" Production was not set for autumn 2006. By 21 December 2008, however, information about the film had been removed from various web resources including the website of production company Kismet status. A \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\"-inspired web series, Dog Soldiers: Legacy, was announced in September 2011 by producer and Kismet vice-president, Allen, now going by D. Eric Allen. A teaser trailer for the series was filmed in northwest Arkansas over the last weekend of August 2011. Directed by Ryan Lightbourn, the trailer included members of Allen's family, including his grandmother Pat \\"Nan\\" Allen and his sister Emmy Allen, as Red. Allen also said the Dog Soldiers sequel was in early pre-production. An early poster of Dog Soldiers: Fresh Meat was released with the tagline \\"Coming 2014\\" across the bottom on 23 March 2014. D. Eric Allen announced that a prequel and another sequel are in the planning stages, and Fresh Meat would be released on 20 December 2014. This date passed with no release and no additional updates on the film's status. Neil Marshall stated in an audio commentary for Dog Soldiers, that the moment in the film when Megan cuts her hand on a shard of glass was meant to be a setup for a second sequel about werewolf DNA, which would complete a planned trilogy. However, he added that the planned sequels will \\"probably amount to nothing now.\\"Neil Marshall, Dog Soldiers audio commentary, 59:16 - 59:38 See also *Battle of Rorke's Drift (mentioned in dialogue as an analogy of the squad's situation) References Sources  * External links  * Category:2002 films Category:2002 horror films Category:British films Category:British horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Neil Marshall Category:Films set in 2001 Category:Films set in Scotland Category:Films shot in Luxembourg Category:Luxembourgian films Category:Luxembourgian horror films Category:Scottish films Category:Syfy original films Category:Werewolves in film Category:2002 directorial debut films ","title":"Dog Soldiers (film)"},{"id":"563864","text":"Hollywood Walk of Fame, in Los Angeles, California, which are depicted as a star Walhalla hall of fame temple, Germany A hall, wall, or walk of fame is a list of individuals, achievements, or animals, usually chosen by a group of electors, to mark their fame in their field.

The album is also available as a two DVD set. With the exception of the last two tracks on the third disc, the album was recorded at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro on the final night of the Vapor Trails Tour. The other two tracks were taken from previous shows on the same tour. \\"Between Sun & Moon\\" was recorded at the Cricket Wireless Pavilion, Phoenix, Arizona, on September 27, 2002, and \\"Vital Signs\\" was recorded at the Colisée Pepsi, Quebec City, Quebec, on October 19, 2002. The DVD has been certified 7× Platinum by the R.I.A.A. in the US with over 700,000 copies sold as of September 2010.https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold- platinum-searchable-database The track \\"O Baterista\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2005, but lost to Brian Wilson's \\"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\\". Rush in Rio was the first live album released by the band to not follow the pattern of releasing a live album after every four studio releases and was also the first to feature a complete setlist without any changes in song order, including Neil Peart's drum solo. It is also the band's first live album that presents a single night's performance in its entirety (not counting the two bonus tracks). In an interview about the album and DVD, Alex Lifeson and James \\"Jimbo\\" Barton noted that it took an extended amount of time to mix the sound. This was due to technical difficulties of recording the audio on primitive equipment. At this concert, Rush played to 40,000, their second-largest crowd on the Vapor Trails Tour (the largest crowd was 60,000 at the show the previous night in São Paulo). In a rare departure from the band's practice of re-creating the sound of their studio work when playing live, the song \\"Resist\\" (on disc 2) was rearranged into a stripped-down acoustic version between Lifeson and Geddy Lee, with Peart sitting out after his drum solo.

Intended for sale in discount and grocery stores, the Crusader 101 was easily among the largest and most detailed toy cars on the market. The toy did not represent any specific car. The front featured stacked, forward-sweeping headlights and slightly pointed hood reminiscent of Pontiacs of the period while the inwardly dished grille and crossbar resembled those used on early 1960s Mercurys. The taillights strongly resembled those on 1948-1956 Cadillacs while the rear end and overall styling suggested the 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible rendered in molded red plastic. The highly detailed interior featured white bucket seats with black inserts both front and rear, matching door panels, black \\"carpeting\\" and a chrome-plated dashboard and console with legible gauges and radio dial resembling those in the Mercury Monterey. The chrome- plated windshield frame surrounded a green-tinted windshield and was topped by working sun visors. The Crusader 101 had the additional benefit of size. It measured about three feet in length - or just under one meter - which allowed for some elaborate detail hitherto unseen in a toy car. The trunk had storage space for a spare tire, jack and lug wrench which could be used to actually change a wheel. Twin radio aerials on either rear fender could be raised or lowered by hand. Not only were the sun visors adjustable, the turn signal lever, steering wheel and gear selector could be moved as well. A male driver figure was included with the car - in a relaxed pose at the wheel and was just as detailed as the car itself. He was unpainted beige plastic. A remote control and battery holder shaped like an automatic transmission selector allowed the car to be \\"driven\\" per the promise on the box of \\"YOU DRIVE IT - YOU PARK IT.\\" Despite its size and level of detail unusual for a toy car, the Crusader 101 was, first and foremost, a toy. The front steering knuckles were prone to breaking, especially if one got a bit too eager with the lug wrench. Electrical problems were common usually manifesting themselves in failed steering control. The windshield frame often warped with age as did the body - though to a much lesser degree - while the vacuum-plated chrome plastic parts tended to turn black. Regardless of its problems, the Crusader 101 is one of the most collectible toy cars of the postwar era. Originally priced at around US$13, prime, mint-with-box examples can easily fetch upwards of $300. The Crusader 101's size has always made it particularly desirable to Barbie collectors since it is well-proportioned to the fashion doll and will easily seat four of them. Deluxe Reading manufactured a \\"Dream Kitchen\\" playset during that period that was scaled to Barbie and similar dolls. As such, the Crusader 101 was the subject of the cover story of the December, 2002 edition of Barbie Bazaar magazine.

They were led by singer-songwriter and guitarist, Brendan \\"Wig\\" Kibble (ex-Vampire Lovers). The group issued one album, Genuine Rock & Roll Medicine Show (Green Fez, 1988), an EP and six singles. Their records did well in the Australian independent charts but they did not appear on the ARIA Charts. They toured nationally but did not perform overseas. History Bam Balams were formed in Sydney in April 1984 with the line-up of Brendan \\"Wig\\" Kibble (ex- Vampire Lovers) on lead vocals and guitar; Dave Stead on guitar and backing vocals; Steve Cole on bass guitar and backing vocals; and Matt Manchester on drums, backing vocals. Dave Stead left the band in 1985, and was replaced by Brad Fitzpatrick. The group got their name from a track on Supersnazz (1969) by the Flamin' Groovies, and are referred to as Bambas by fans. Their influences included Gene Vincent, Johnny Burnette, Tony Joe White, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Byrds, Buck Owens and The Standells. The band released their first two singles, \\"Deliver My Love\\" (December 1985) and \\"No-One Else\\" (June 1986), on Citadel Records with Rob Younger (ex-member of Radio Birdman) producing. Also in 1986 they released \\"Same Old Tune\\", as a split single with September Gurls' \\"Precious\\" on Guiding Light Records as a give-away with Adventure #2 magazine in Denmark. In 1987, the original line up split up (Fitzpatrick, Cole, and Manchester went on to form The Hexbreakers, who cut a single 'Faraway Years' for Green Fez Records).Kibble formed a second line-up in 1987 with Amr Z. Abdallah (later of ARIA No 1 chart toppers Ratcat) on bass guitar, Steve Carlin on guitar, and Warren Elford on drums, which recorded a single, \\"Surfin' in the Swamp\\" (March 1988), for Citadel Record's Green Fez label. Soon after a third line-up formed, with Kibble and Abdallah joined by Ian \\"The Reverend\\" Little (ex-Grooveyard) on guitar and Joe Breen (Coupe DeVille) on drums, they recorded the group's one album, Genuine Rock & Roll Medicine Show (December 1988) and its lead single, \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" (November). Greg Marchant replaced Abdallah on bass guitar in 1989 (Abdallah left the band to join Ratcat), and this line-up recorded the single, \\"Hellfire\\" (November 1989). Dave Castellari replaced Marchant later that year, and they recorded a 12\\" extended play, 45 RPM Extended Play, with the track \\"10,000 Miles (A España)\\" on Pink Flamingo Records. The group provided the lead track, \\"Munster Rock'n'Roller\\", for the 1990 Munster Records compilation, Munster Dance Hall Favourites Vol III. In 1990, the line-up changed again with Terry Stanley on bass guitar, and Tim Denny on drums, they remained until the band split in 1992. The gained popularity overseas including Spain, France and Italy; but they had never toured outside Australia. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, \\"[w]hile many of their Sydney-based contemporaries exploited Detroit-inspired hard rock, ... 1960s acid-punk ... or 1960s psychedelia\\", Bam Balams played a mix of garage rock, swamp rock- swamp pop, R&B;, rockabilly, jangle pop and 1950s-1960s style country music. Their records did well on the Australian independent charts but they did not appear on the ARIA Charts. Kibble formed the Navahodads in 1995, which played swampy R&B;, Country, and Rock n Roll, they released two albums and toured overseas.

Jingshan's history dates to the Liao and Jin dynasties, almost a thousand years ago.Beijing Jingshan Park Official Website Accessed 2013-06-18 The high artificial hill was constructed in the Yongle era of the Ming dynasty entirely from the soil excavated in forming the moats of the Imperial Palace and nearby canals. All of this material was moved by manual labor and animal power. Jingshan consists of five individual peaks, and on the top of each peak there lies an elaborate pavilion. These pavilions were used by officials for gathering and leisure purposes. These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing. The dictates of feng shui long praised tombs and residences sited south of a nearby hill, serving to channel both harmful yin and cold northern winds. With Jingshan serving that purpose, it gained the name Feng Shui Hill. It is also well known to locals as Coal Hill, from an old rumor that the emperors kept a hidden stash in the park.The China Guide. \\"Jingshan Park \\". Accessed 16 November 2013. The Chongzhen Emperor, the last ruler of the Ming dynasty, committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree in Jingshan in 1644 after Beijing fell to Li Zicheng's rebel forces.  Relationship with the Forbidden City  Jingshan Hill is separated from the Forbidden City by the palace moat. However, until 1928 the park sat directly by the moat and was accessible on the south side only from the Forbidden City via the Gate of Divine Might. In 1928, a new road (New Jingshan Street) was built to the north of the palace moat. This fully separated Jingshan Hill from the Forbidden City. The Gate of Divine Might became the back door of the Palace Museum, and the front gate of Jingshan Park now stood to the north of the new road. The street addresses of both the Forbidden City and Jingshan Park are on New Jingshan Street. Jingshan Park is now a popular place for people to gather and socialize. One can often find elderly folks dancing, singing opera and doing other cultural activities, such as kuaiban, at Jingshan Park. Access The park has four entrances, one in each of the cardinal directions, but only three are currently open to the public. The south entrance is located across Jingshan Front Street from the Forbidden City and is accessible by Beijing Bus routes 101, 103, 109, 124, 202, 211, 609 and 685. The west entrance on Jingshan West Street and Doushan Street is a short walk from the east gate of Beihai Park and is accessible by Bus routes 5 and 609. Trolleybus routes 111 and 124 stop at the east entrance. The north entrance is currently closed to the public. It is at the T-intersection between Jingshan Back Street and Di'anmen Inner Street and is accessible by Bus routes 5, 111, 124 and 609.

Argyle is the fourth-largest diamond producer in the world by volume, although due to the low proportion of gem-quality diamonds it is set to close by 2020. It is the only known significant source of pink and red diamonds, producing over 90% of the world's supply. It additionally provides a large proportion of other naturally coloured diamonds, including champagne, cognac and rare blue diamonds. On June 21, 2015, after more than 11 years and 42 kilometres of tunnelling, the Argyle underground block cave development was officially completed. In 2013, Argyle is estimated to produce 10.2 million carats with an average per carat price of $25/carat. The Argyle diamond mine is also notable for being the first successful commercial diamond mine exploiting a volcanic pipe of lamproite, rather than the more usual kimberlite pipe; much earlier attempts to mine diamonds from a lamproite pipe in Arkansas, United States, were commercially unsuccessful. The Argyle mine is owned by the Rio Tinto Group, a diversified mining company which also owns the Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada and the Murowa diamond mine in Zimbabwe. Description The mine site covers about , stretching in a mostly linear shape about long and wide. The mine is of open-pit construction, and reaches about 600 m deep at its deepest point. The open cut closed in 2010. An underground block cave mine is currently under development, and is likely to extend Argyle's diamond production until 2018. Location The Argyle diamond mine is located in the Kimberley region in the far northeast of the Australian state of Western Australia.Short description of Argyle Diamonds at LJWest Diamonds It is located to the south-west of Lake Argyle in the Matsu Ranges, about south-west of Darwin. Because it is by road from the nearest settlement (Kununurra), a complete residential camp has been constructed on site. Most of the 520 workers commute from Perth, over away, for alternating two-week shifts at the mine. The mine has encouraged local employment and has a large number of indigenous local people working within the mine. History Small quantities of alluvially deposited diamonds have been known in Australia since the late 19th century, first found by prospectors searching for gold. However, no source volcanic pipe deposit was apparent. Following the discovery of several alluvial diamonds in the West Kimberley region along the Lennard River (Ellendale area) in 1969 a systematic search of Western Australia for the source of these diamonds was began by a consortium of mining companies, collectively known as the Kalumburu Joint Venture. Tanganyika Holdings part of the Kalumburu Joint Venture (later to become the Ashton Joint Venture) had employed Maureen Muggeridge. In 1979, Muggeridge discovered diamond samples in the floodplain of a small creek that flowed in Lake Argyle. She soon traced the source of the diamonds to the headwaters of Smoke Creek. On 2 October 1979, the Argyle pipe was discovered. Over the following three years, the deposit was assessed for economic viability, and in 1983 the decision was made to commence mining operations. Alluvial mining operations commenced immediately, while the open-pit mine was constructed over a period of 18 months at a cost of A$450 million. The mine was commissioned in December 1985. Geology The mine is the first successful commercial diamond mine (except alluvial mining operations) not located on a kimberlite pipe. The pipe is named \\"AK-1\\", although it is commonly simply called the \\"Argyle pipe\\". The volcanic pipe is a diatreme, composed of olivine lamproite, present as tuff and lava. Peripheral volcanic facies suggest the lamproite eruption formed a maar. At the margins of the volcanic pipe the lamproite is mixed with a volcanic breccia containing shattered wall rock fragments mixed and milled by the eruption. Minerals in the marginal facies include zeolite minerals, micas, kaolinite and clays, typical of post-eruption hydrothermal circulation. Diamonds are found within the intact core of the volcanic pipe, as well as within some of the marginal breccia facies and maar facies. However, some diamonds are considered to have been resorbed during the post-eruption cooling of the pipe and converted to graphite. The diatreme pipe formed by explosive eruption of the lamproite magma through a zone of weakness in the continental crust. The diamonds found at the Argyle pipe have been dated to about 1.58 billion years of age, while the volcano which created the pipe is aged between 1.1 and 1.2 billion years old. This represents a relatively short period during which diamond formation could have taken place (around 400 million years), which may explain the small average size and unusual physical characteristics of Argyle diamonds. Diamonds found in the Argyle pipe are predominantly eclogitic, meaning that the carbon is of organic origin (see Natural history of diamonds). In addition to the pipe itself, a number of semipermanent streams have eroded away portions of the pipe and created significant alluvial deposits of diamonds. These deposits are also actively mined. Production Logo Argyle is the fourth-largest diamond-producing mine in the world by volume, averaging annual production of . Production peaked in 1994, when were produced. Since operations began in 1983, Argyle's open pit mine has produced over of rough diamonds. Most of Argyle's gem-quality production is in brown diamonds. These diamonds are usually difficult to sell, although Rio Tinto has seen some success in a decade-long marketing campaign to promote brown diamonds as champagne and cognac toned. In contrast, the company has no problems selling diamonds in pink, purple and red tones, which are very rare and in high demand, therefore commanding premium prices. The pink diamonds are processed and sold as polished diamonds by a specialised team based in Perth to customers worldwide. The mine has ore processing and diamond sorting facilities on site. Once diamonds are removed from the ore and acid washed, they are sorted and shipped to Perth for further sorting and sale. A significant quantity of diamonds are cut in India, where low costs of labour allow small diamonds to be cut for a profit; this is especially relevant to the Argyle mine, which on average produces smaller rough diamonds than other mines do. Diamond characteristics A large brown Argyle diamond, 3.6 carats The diamonds produced at the Argyle diamond mine are of an average low quality. Only 5% of mined diamonds are of gem quality, compared to a worldwide average of 20% (Author Janine Roberts contends that the \\"near-gem quality\\" rating is subjective and misleading because these diamonds can be cut into gems if desired.); of the remaining 95%, they are about evenly split between classifications of \\"near-gem quality\\" and industrial grade; 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown, followed by 16% yellow, 2% white, 2% grey, and less than 1% pink and green. Despite the low production volume of pink and red diamonds, the Argyle mine is the only reliable source in the world, producing 90 to 95% of all pink and red diamonds. Most Argyle diamonds are classified as type 1a (see material properties of diamond), and have low levels of nitrogen impurities, their colour resulting instead from structural defects of the crystal lattice. Argyle diamonds tend to fluoresce blue or dull green under ultraviolet light, and blue-white under X-ray radiation. The most common inclusion is unconverted graphite, followed by crystalline inclusions of orange garnet, pyroxene, and olivine. Annual Diamond Tender Each year, a small collection of the best pink diamonds are offered in an exclusive sale known as the Argyle Pink Diamond Tender. For every of rough pink diamonds produced by the mine, only polished will be offered for sale at the tender. It is an invitation-only event. Access to the collector's edition catalogue and website access in itself is highly sought after. In March 2009, Argyle announced their first-ever tender of rare blue diamonds. The \\"Once in a Blue Moon\\" collection was sourced over several years, and comprised a range of precious blue and violet diamonds, which weighed in total . In 2016, the annual Argyle Tender became the highest-selling tender in its 20-year history, according to the Diamond Investment & Intelligence Center. Reserves Initial proven reserves of the Argyle mine were 61 million tonnes of ore, with an average ore grade of per ore tonne, about . Further estimated reserves of 14 million tonnes of ore, at a grade of per tonne (85 million carats, 17,000 kg), also existed. As of 2001, reserves and resources in the open-pit-mined area contain 220 million tonnes of 2.5- to 3.0-carat-per-tonne (500 to 600 mg) graded ore, sufficient to sustain current production rates until 2007. The ore grades at the Argyle mine are unusually high, with most commercial diamond mines averaging grades of per metric ton. Alluvial deposits of diamonds are believed to have been exhausted. In 1989–1990, drill samples were taken from over 300 m below the floor of the pit. At the end of 1989 around 238 million tons of ore, with an estimated grade of 3.7 carats per ton were quoted as a resource. Much of this resource was below the open pit and was the subject of an underground mining study carried out in the mid-1990s. In the late 1990s, part of the west wall of the open pit mine, containing 25 million tonnes of waste rock, began to collapse. In 1998, the decision was made to remove or \\"cut back\\" the unstable part of the west wall which freed up further economic ore in the south part of the open pit. This cut back cost around $100 million. Argyle has just announced on March 2, 2018 that it's estimated Ore Reserves decreased by 13 million tonnes to just 16 million tonnes. They mined 5 million tonnes in 2017. A more conservative view on future production performance and grades could bring forward the economic shut-off criteria. An exploration decline was constructed at a cost of A$70 million to evaluate the economics of mining diamonds from the diamondiferous pipes below the floor of the open pit; these reserves would be mined underground (by block caving), rather than the open-pit method currently used. In late 2005, Rio Tinto Ltd concluded that the operation was economically feasible. Pre-production construction of the underground mine commenced in early to mid-2006.  Economics  The Argyle diamond mine is economically feasible because its large reserves and high- grade ore offset a low average diamond value. The estimated value of Argyle diamond production is only US$7 per carat ($35/g); this compares to values of $70 per carat ($350/g) for diamonds produced at the Diavik mine and US$170 per carat ($850/g) at the Ekati mine, both in Canada. However, Argyle has two to four times the concentration of diamonds (ore grade) of these mines. This makes extraction economically feasible, as mine costs are mostly related to the amount of ore processed, not the amount of diamond extracted. Underground expansion Aerial view of the open pit in 2007 In 2005, Rio Tinto was given the go-ahead to a future expansion project, moving it from an open pit to an underground mine.More block cave diamonds at Infomine This plan was postponed; in September 2010 Rio Tinto announced fresh plans to develop an underground mine beneath the existing pit, increasing annual production to 9 million tonnes of ore. The project is predominantly an underground construction requiring high-quality development and engineering excellence. The Block Cave is expected to operate until the end of 2020 using the latest in mining technology, including Sandvik's auto mining technology. The project is due to be completed by 2013, two years later than first planned, after diamond prices slumped.

If the dynamical process can escape the well around the current minimum estimate it will not be trapped by other local minima that are higher. Wells with deeper minima are enhanced.

Master Gunnery Sergeants are senior staff non- commissioned officers (SNCOs) with the pay grade of E-9, equivalent to Sergeants Major and the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps (though the latter is a single unique billet in the Corps, and is senior to all enlisted ranks). Master Gunnery Sergeants are sometimes referred to by the nicknames \\"Master Guns\\" or \\"Master Gunny\\". These nicknames are considered unacceptable in formal or ceremonial situations and, at the rank holder's discretion, may also be unacceptable for use by lower-ranking Marines. The Master Gunnery Sergeant insignia consists of a bursting bomb (colloquially referred to as a \\"pineapple\\" due to the similarity of its appearance as stylized) centered vertically between three chevrons and four rockers. History The grade was derived from another grade unique to the United States Marine Corps, the Gunnery Sergeant, and has been in use (though not continuously) since the time of the Spanish–American War (April 25 – August 12, 1898). Establishment of the grade in its current form and pay grade occurred during a sweeping reorganization of grades in 1958 and 1959. The grade was included, along with the grade of Master Sergeant, in a new career path for the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 which allowed senior SNCO billets to be filled by occupational specialists. This move was designed to officially acknowledge the ever- increasing complexity of modern warfare, while still keeping the First Sergeant and Sergeant Major career paths with their historic command emphasis intact. (During and prior to World War II, this was reversed; the Sergeant Major at the time was an administrative position while the Master Gunnery Sergeant was part of the S-3 section and enforced discipline.) Modern role Master gunnery sergeant insignia Master Gunnery Sergeants (MGySgts) with an infantry Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) serve in the billet of operations chief, as the senior staff non-commissioned officer in the operations section of an infantry battalion, or higher level (e.g., MEU, infantry regiment, MEB, Marine division, or MEF) headquarters. MGySgts with a non-infantry (e.g., artillery, tank, communications, logistics) MOS typically serve as either the operations chief of their MOS type battalion/regiment (e.g., artillery battalion/regiment, tank battalion) or as the section chief/NCOIC in their MOS related staff section (e.g., communications, logistics) at the regimental/Marine Aircraft Group, or higher level, headquarters. Master Gunnery Sergeants with the Military Police MOS serve in the billet of Provost Sergeant in the Provost Marshal's Office. Master Gunnery Sergeants with an aviation maintenance MOS serve in the billet of maintenance NCOIC/chief in the aircraft maintenance department of a Marine aircraft squadron or in maintenance-related billets at the Marine Air Group (MAG) or Marine Air Wing (MAW) level. For example, there are four aviation-related MGySgt billets (aircraft maintenance NCOIC, aviation supply NCOIC, avionics NCOIC, and aviation ordnance NCOIC) in the Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron (MALS) organic to each Marine Aircraft Group (MAG). In their annual performance evaluations, called \\"fitness reports\\", eligible Gunnery Sergeants indicate whether they wish to be considered for promotion to Master Sergeant or First Sergeant, and thus whether they enter the promotional track for Master Gunnery Sergeant or Sergeant Major. Once promoted, the promotional track is usually permanent, with lateral movement between the two programs very uncommon. One of the major differences between the two E-9 ranks is that Master Gunnery Sergeants retain an occupational field-related MOS, while Sergeants Major receive a new MOS to reflect their specific command-related focus. This reinforces the Master Gunnery Sergeant's role as a provider of military leadership, technical acumen, and mastery of their MOS. It is also important to note that while a Sergeant Major and a Master Gunnery Sergeant have different duties and responsibilities, a Master Gunnery Sergeant can (and often does) assume the duties of a Sergeant Major. The reverse is rarely possible.

The discrete log problem is of fundamental importance to the area of public key cryptography. Many of the most commonly used cryptography systems are based on the assumption that the discrete log is extremely difficult to compute; the more difficult it is, the more security it provides a data transfer. One way to increase the difficulty of the discrete log problem is to base the cryptosystem on a larger group. Theory The algorithm is based on a space–time tradeoff. It is a fairly simple modification of trial multiplication, the naive method of finding discrete logarithms. Given a cyclic group G of order n, a generator \\\\alpha of the group and a group element \\\\beta, the problem is to find an integer x such that : \\\\alpha^x = \\\\beta\\\\,. The baby-step giant-step algorithm is based on rewriting x: :x = im + j :m = \\\\left\\\\lceil \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\right\\\\rceil :0 \\\\leq i < m :0 \\\\leq j < m Therefore, we have: : \\\\alpha^x = \\\\beta\\\\, : \\\\alpha^{im + j} = \\\\beta\\\\, : \\\\alpha^j = \\\\beta\\\\left(\\\\alpha^{-m}\\\\right)^i\\\\, The algorithm precomputes \\\\alpha^j for several values of j. Then it fixes an m and tries values of i in the right- hand side of the congruence above, in the manner of trial multiplication. It tests to see if the congruence is satisfied for any value of j, using the precomputed values of \\\\alpha^j. The algorithm Input: A cyclic group G of order n, having a generator α and an element β. Output: A value x satisfying \\\\alpha^x = \\\\beta. # m ← Ceiling() # For all j where 0 ≤ j < m: ## Compute αj and store the pair (j, αj) in a table. (See ) # Compute α−m. # γ ← β.

The best in this case is a hash table. The hashing is done on the second component, and to perform the check in step 1 of the main loop, γ is hashed and the resulting memory address checked. Since hash tables can retrieve and add elements in O(1) time (constant time), this does not slow down the overall baby-step giant-step algorithm. The running time of the algorithm and the space complexity is O(\\\\sqrt n), much better than the O(n) running time of the naive brute force calculation. The Baby-step giant-step algorithm is often used to solve for the shared key in the Diffie Hellman key exchange, when the modulus is a prime number. If the modulus is not prime, the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm has a smaller algorithmic complexity, and solves the same problem.  Notes  * The baby-step giant-step algorithm is a generic algorithm. It works for every finite cyclic group. * It is not necessary to know the order of the group G in advance. The algorithm still works if n is merely an upper bound on the group order. * Usually the baby-step giant-step algorithm is used for groups whose order is prime. If the order of the group is composite then the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm is more efficient. * The algorithm requires O(m) memory. It is possible to use less memory by choosing a smaller m in the first step of the algorithm. Doing so increases the running time, which then is O(n/m). Alternatively one can use Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms, which has about the same running time as the baby-step giant-step algorithm, but only a small memory requirement. * While this algorithm is credited to Daniel Shanks, who published the 1971 paper in which it first appears, a 1994 paper by NechaevV.

Under intense pressure (but limited temperature), the crystalline structure of quartz is deformed along planes inside the crystal. These planes, which show up as lines under a microscope, are called planar deformation features (PDFs), or shock lamellae. Discovery Shocked quartz was discovered following underground nuclear bomb testing, which generated the intense pressures required to alter the quartz lattice. Eugene Shoemaker showed that shocked quartz is also found inside craters created by meteor impact, such as the Barringer Crater and Chicxulub crater. The presence of shocked quartz supports that such craters were formed by impact, because a volcanic eruption would not generate the required pressure. Lightning is now known to contribute to the surface record of shocked quartz grains, complicating identification of hypervelocity impact features. Formation Shocked quartz is usually associated in nature with two high-pressure polymorphs of silicon dioxide: coesite and stishovite. These polymorphs have a crystal structure different from standard quartz. This structure can be formed only by intense pressure (more than 2 gigapascals), but at moderate temperatures. Coesite and stishovite are usually viewed as indicative of impact events, eclogite facies metamorphism, (or thermonuclear explosion), but are also found in sediments prone to lightning strikes and in fulgurites. Occurrence Shocked quartz is found worldwide, and occurs in the thin Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary layer, which occurs at the contact between Cretaceous and Paleogene rocks. This is further evidence (in addition to iridium enrichment) that the transition between the two geologic periods was caused by a large impact. Lightning also generates planar deformation features in quartz and is capable of propagating appropriate pressure/temperature gradients in rocks and sediments alike. This very common mechanism may significantly contribute to the accumulation of shocked quartz in the geologic record. Mantle xenoliths and sediments derived from them may contain coesite or stishovite. Though shocked quartz is only recently recognized, Eugene Shoemaker discovered it prior to its crystallographic description in building stones in the Bavarian town of Nördlingen, derived from shock-metamorphic rocks, such as breccia and pseudotachylite, of Ries crater.

Founded in 1874, the SUNY Maritime College was the first college of its kind (federally approved, offering commercial nautical instruction) to be founded in the United States and is one of only seven degree-granting maritime academies in the United States.  History  Maritime College is the oldest institution of its kind in the United States. Due in part to the Civil War, there was a decline in the American maritime industry and a growing concern about the professionalism of its officers. As a result, the New York Chamber of Commerce and maritime interests of the port of New York lobbied the state legislature to create a professional nautical school for the city. This was done in 1873, but the school lacked a ship. The chamber then teamed up with the noted naval education reformer and modernizer, Stephen B. Luce. Luce led the effort, and through his efforts an act was passed by Congress in 1874 that enabled individual states to request from the Navy retired or obsolete vessels to train seamen. The state of New York then appealed to the Navy for a training vessel. On December 14, 1874, the USS St. Mary's arrived in New York harbor and became the home of the longest running nautical school in the United States. Originally administered by the Board of Education of the City of New York, it was conducted as a grammar school that taught common school subjects (along with nautical classes) during the winter term, and then held practical cruises during the summer term. As time advanced, the school began to teach more advanced professional subjects. During this early period, the school was typically run on an annual appropriation of $20,000 to $30,000 with the school often facing closure because the cost per pupil was much higher than in a regular public school, mainly due to the overhead of ship maintenance and student board. SUNY Maritime College from the shore By 1907, the St. Mary's was replaced by the gunboat Newport, a sail-steam hybrid. In 1913 New York City threatened to close the school due to its costs. However, the state of New York took over its management and renamed it the New York State Nautical School. Despite being a state institution, the school was almost closed in 1916, again for budgetary reasons, but efforts from the maritime industry and the school's alumni kept it alive. After this time, the American merchant marine grew and subsequently a greater demand for trained American merchant marine brought growth to the school. During this period, the school was administered by a Board of Governors in addition to the Superintendent. In 1921, the school, which had for long moved from berth to berth, found itself at Bedloe's Island (now Liberty Island) in New York Harbor. There they were allowed to use the army facilities. Over time, conditions on the island were deemed inadequate to teach modern merchant mariners. With the growing demand, a push was made by then superintendent James Harvey Tomb beginning in 1927 to acquire a larger ship and a land-based institution. The ship came in the form of the Procyon, which was renamed the Empire State. This ship effectively doubled the size of the school. Finally, the school, renamed the \\"New York State Merchant Marine Academy\\", in 1929 became land-based in 1938 at the Maritime College's present Throggs Neck campus in Fort Schuyler. One of Franklin D. Roosevelt's last acts as Governor of New York State was to sign the act turning Fort Schuyler and the Throggs Neck peninsula over to the school for use as a shore-based facility of higher education. Work restoring Fort Schuyler for the academy's use was done at first by the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration (TERA) in 1934 followed by the Works Progress Administration in 1935. The fort was restored, allowing the school to operate there by 1938. In 1946 degree conferring status was granted, and the academy became a college. The college was one of the original institutions incorporated into the State University of New York system in 1948.Williams, J.A. Four Years Before the Mast: A History of New York's Maritime College. Fort Schuyler Press, 2013 . Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the decision was made to move the students out of the dorms 16 March 2020. Three plans were implemented in regard to Summer Sea Term 2020: a 60 day summer sea term starting in June, a 30 day summer sea term starting in July, or no sea term for the summer of 2020. With the situation regarding the pandemic worsening, the college decided not to do a summer sea term. However, the college let any regimental students come to campus on 13 July 2020 for 30 days as a way to get sea days needed to graduate, take the burden off of sea days needed for Summer Sea Term 2021 (as there would be too many students on the ship who need to catch up on sea days), and to finish any outstanding license assessments from the spring semester that could not have been done remotely. Academics All of the college's bachelor's degree programs may be combined with preparation for the professional license as a United States Merchant Marine Officer. The College also offers a master's degree in International Transportation Management and Maritime and Naval Studies; as well as several graduate Professional Mariner Training certificates. Most of the degree programs may be completed while concurrently preparing for the United States Merchant Marine officer's license as a third mate or third assistant engineer. Additionally, SUNY Maritime College has the only United States Navy/United States Marine Corps Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) program in the metropolitan New York City area, which prepares enrollees for commissioned officer positions in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. , the graduates of SUNY Maritime College earned US$144,000, the highest average annual salary of any university graduates in the United States.  Athletics  SUNY Maritime College teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III, competing primarily in the Skyline Conference for the majority of its sports, as well as the ECFC for football, ICSA for sailing, and US Rowing for its rowing teams. The department currently sponsors 16 different varsity programs: baseball, men's basketball, men's and women's cross country, football, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's rowing, co-ed dinghy sailing, co-ed offshore sailing, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's swimming & diving, and women's volleyball. The department also offers ice hockey, mixed rifle and rugby at the club level, ice hockey competes as a Division III member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association, mixed rifle competes in the Mid-Atlantic Rifle Conference, and rugby competes in the Tri-State Rugby Conference.  Regiment  SUNY Maritime College has a regiment to fulfill the USCG requirements for obtaining a license through a college. The regiment has a Pipe and Drum Band, Regimental Band, Honor Guard (Color Guard and Drill Team), and a Security Company. The Band and Honor Guard perform at events both on and off campus, such as parades and dinners. Incoming Cadets must go through Indoctrination (shortened to INDOC), a ten days of training in August where they learn leadership and basic seamanship skills. During freshman year, aka Mariner Under Guidance (MUG) year, Cadets are made to square corners, stand at attention for all upperclassmen, have room inspections, and maintain the uniform of the day.

Coesite was first synthesized by Loring Coes Jr., a chemist at the Norton Company, in 1953.The word \\"coesite\\" is pronounced as \\"Coze-ite\\" after chemist Loring Coes Jr. Occurrences In 1960, a natural occurrence of coesite was reported by Edward C. T. Chao, in collaboration with Eugene Shoemaker, from Barringer Crater, in Arizona, US, which was evidence that the crater must have been formed by an impact. After this report, the presence of coesite in unmetamorphosed rocks was taken as evidence of a meteorite impact event or of an atomic bomb explosion. It was not expected that coesite would survive in high pressure metamorphic rocks. In metamorphic rocks, coesite was initially described in eclogite xenoliths from the mantle of the Earth that were carried up by ascending magmas; kimberlite is the most common host of such xenoliths. In metamorphic rocks, coesite is now recognized as one of the best mineral indicators of metamorphism at very high pressures (UHP, or ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism). Such UHP metamorphic rocks record subduction or continental collisions in which crustal rocks are carried to depths of or more. Coesite is formed at pressures above about 2.5 GPa (25 kbar) and temperature above about 700 °C. This corresponds to a depth of about 70 km in the Earth. It can be preserved as mineral inclusions in other phases because as it partially reverts to quartz, the quartz rim exerts pressure on the core of the grain, preserving the metastable grain as tectonic forces uplift and expose these rock at the surface. As a result, the grains have a characteristic texture of a polycrystalline quartz rim (see infobox figure). Coesite has been identified in UHP metamorphic rocks around the world, including the western Alps of Italy at Dora Maira, the Erzgebirge of Germany, the Lanterman Range of Antarctica, in the Kokchetav Massif of Kazakhstan, in the Western Gneiss region of Norway, the Dabie-Shan Range in Eastern China, the Himalayas of Eastern Pakistan, and the Vermont Appalachian Mountains. Crystal structure Atomic structure of coesite Coesite is a tectosilicate with each silicon atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedron. Each oxygen atom is then bonded to two Si atoms to form a framework. There are two crystallographically distinct Si atoms and five different oxygen positions in the unit cell. Although the unit cell is close to being hexagonal in shape (\\"a\\" and \\"c\\" are nearly equal and β nearly 120°), it is inherently monoclinic and cannot be hexagonal. The crystal structure of coesite is similar to that of feldspar and consists of four silicon dioxide tetrahedra arranged in Si4O8 and Si8O16 rings. The rings are further arranged into chains. This structure is metastable within the stability field of quartz: coesite will eventually decay back into quartz with a consequent volume increase, although the metamorphic reaction is very slow at the low temperatures of the Earth's surface. The crystal symmetry is monoclinic C2/c, No.15, Pearson symbol mS48.

Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini, or Our Lady of the Conception of the Capuchins, is a church in Rome, Italy, commissioned in 1626 by Pope Urban VIII, whose brother, Antonio Barberini, was a Capuchin friar. It is located at Via Veneto, close to Piazza Barberini.Rendina, Claudio (1999). Enciclopedia di Roma. Newton Compton. Interior The Archangel Michael, painted by Guido Reni.The church was designed by Antonio Casoni and built between 1626 and 1631. It comprises a small nave and several side chapels. The chapels are notable as one contains the body of St. Felix of Cantalice and another is the tomb of the Saint Crispin of Viterbo. The first chapel has a dramatic altarpiece of St. Michael the Archangel (c.1635) by Guido Reni, and Gherardo delle Notti's Christ Mocked. The second chapel has a Transfiguration by Mario Balassi, and a Nativity (c. 1632) by Lanfranco. The third chapel has a Saint Francis receives stigmata by Domenichino. The fourth chapel houses a Prayer in the Gesthemane (c. 1632) by Baccio Ciarpi. In the fifth chapel is a Saint Anthony by Sacchi, who also painted the Apparition of the Virgin (1645) to Saint Bonaventure in the fifth chapel on the left. The tomb monument for Alexander Sobieski was sculpted by Camillo Rusconi. The third chapel has a Deposition by Andrea Camassei and a Stigmatization of Saint Francis (c. 1570) by Girolamo Muziano. The second chapel has a Santa Felice da Cantalice by Alessandro Turchi, while the first has a painting of Saint Paul restores vision (c. 1631) by Pietro da Cortona. Crypt The crypt is located just under the church. Cardinal Antonio Barberini, who was a member of the Capuchin order, in 1631 ordered the remains of thousands of Capuchin friars exhumed and transferred from the friary Via dei Lucchesi to the crypt. The bones were arranged along the walls, and the friars began to bury their own dead there, as well as the bodies of poor Romans, whose tomb was under the floor of the present Mass chapel. Here the Capuchins would come to pray and reflect each evening before retiring for the night. The crypt, or ossuary, now contains the remains of 4,000 friars buried between 1500 and 1870, during which time the Roman Catholic Church permitted burial in and under churches. The underground crypt is divided into five chapels, lit only by dim natural light seeping in through cracks, and small fluorescent lamps. The crypt walls are decorated with the remains in elaborate fashion, making this crypt a macabre work of art. Some of the skeletons are intact and draped with Franciscan habits, but for the most part, individual bones are used to create elaborate ornamental designs. The crypt originated at a period of a rich and creative cult for their dead; great spiritual masters meditated and preached with a skull in hand. A plaque in one of the chapels reads, in three languages, \\"What you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.\\" This is a memento mori. The popularity of the crypt as a tourist attraction once rivalled the Catacombs. The Sedlec ossuary (1870) in the Czech Republic and the Skull Chapel in Poland are said to have been inspired by it. File:Rom, Santa Maria Immacolata a Via Veneto, Krypta der Kapuziner 2.jpgFile:Rom, Santa Maria Immacolata a Via Veneto, Krypta der Kapuziner 1.jpgLiterary references  Several renowned authors visited the crypt and left descriptions. The Marquis de Sade, who visited the crypt in 1775, wrote, “I have never seen anything more striking” (Voyage d'Italie, p. 106 of the Maurice Lever edition). Mark Twain visited the crypt in the summer of 1867, and begins Chapter XXVIII of The Innocents Abroad with 5 pages of his observations. Nathaniel Hawthorne describes the crypt in his novel The Marble Faun. Additional descriptions were written by authors Tom Weil (1992), Folke Henschen (1965) and Anneli Rufus (1999).

It is designed for efficient rendering of multichannel three- dimensional positional audio. Its API style and conventions deliberately resemble those of OpenGL. OpenAL is an environmental 3D audio library, which can add realism to a game by simulating attenuation (degradation of sound over distance), the Doppler effect (change in frequency as a result of motion), and material densities. OpenAL aimed to originally be an open standard and open- source replacement for proprietary (and generally incompatible with one another) 3D audio APIs such as DirectSound and Core Audio, though in practice has largely been implemented on various platforms as a wrapper around said proprietary APIs or as a proprietary and vendor-specific fork. While the reference implementation later became proprietary, there are open source implementations such as OpenAL Soft available. History OpenAL was originally developed in 2000 by Loki Software to help them in their business of porting Windows games to Linux. After the demise of Loki, the project was maintained for a time by the free software/open source community, and implemented on NVIDIA nForce sound cards and motherboards. It is now hosted (and largely developed) by Creative Technology with on-going support from Apple,https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/OpenAL/ Blue Ripple Sound via their Rapture3D OpenAL Driver,http://www.blueripplesound.com/gaming and individual open-source developers. While the OpenAL charter says that there will be an \\"Architecture Review Board\\" (ARB) modeled on the OpenGL ARB, no such organization has ever been formed and the OpenAL specification is generally handled and discussed via email on its public mailing list. Since 1.1, the implementation by Creative has turned proprietary, with the last releases in free licenses still accessible through the project's Subversion source code repository. However, OpenAL Soft is a widely used open source alternative. API structure and functionality The general functionality of OpenAL is encoded in source objects, audio buffers and a single listener. A source object contains a pointer to a buffer, the velocity, position and direction of the sound, and the intensity of the sound. The listener object contains the velocity, position and direction of the listener, and the general gain applied to all sound. Buffers contain audio data in PCM format, either 8- or 16-bit, in either monaural or stereo format. The rendering engine performs all necessary calculations as far as distance attenuation, Doppler effect, etc. The net result of all of this for the end user is that in a properly written OpenAL application, sounds behave quite naturally as the user moves through the three-dimensional space of the virtual world. From a programmer's perspective, very little additional work is required to make this happen in an existing OpenGL-based 3D graphical application. Unlike the OpenGL specification, the OpenAL specification includes two subsections of the API: the core consisting of the actual OpenAL function calls, and the ALC (Audio Library Context) API which is used to manage rendering contexts, resource usage and locking in a cross platform manner. There is also an 'ALUT' (Audio Library Utility Toolkit) library that provides higher level 'convenience' functions — exactly analogous to OpenGL's 'GLUT'. In order to provide additional functionality in the future, OpenAL utilizes an extension mechanism. Individual vendors are thereby able to include their own extensions into distributions of OpenAL, commonly for the purpose of exposing additional functionality on their proprietary hardware. Extensions can be promoted to ARB (Architecture Review Board) status, indicating a standard extension which will be maintained for backwards compatibility. ARB extensions have the prospect of being added to the core API after a period of time. For advanced digital signal processing and hardware-accelerated sound effects, the EFX (Effects Extension) or environmental audio extensions (EAX) can be used. Limitations The single listener model in OpenAL is tailored to a single human user and is not fit for artificial intelligence or robotic simulations or multiple human participants as in collaborative musical performances. In these cases a multiple listener model is required. OpenAL also fails to take into account sound propagation delays (the speed of sound is used for the Doppler effect only). The distance to a sound source only translates into an amplitude effect (attenuation) and not a delay. Hence OpenAL cannot be used for time difference of arrival calculations unless that functionality is added in separately.Open Source FPS Game Alien Arena 2009 Released #28412367 In order to take full speed advantage of OpenAL, a vendor/hardware specific implementation is needed and these are seldom released as open source. Many supported platforms in fact implement OpenAL as a wrapper which simply translates calls to the platform's native, and often proprietary, audio API. On Windows, if a vendor specific implementation is not detected it will fall back to the wrap_oal.dll wrapper library that translates OpenAL into DirectSound (Generic Software) or DirectSound3D (Generic Hardware); the removal of the latter from Windows Vista onward has effectively broken generic hardware acceleration on modern versions of Windows.Enumeration with OpenAL on WindowsOpenAL® and Windows Vista™ Supported platforms The API is available on the following platforms and Operating systems: Android (supports OpenSL ES), AmigaOS 3.x and 4.x,http://se.aminet.net/dev/lib/openal-soft.readme Bada, BlackBerry 10, BlackBerry PlayBook, BSD, iOS (supports Core Audio), IRIX, Linux (supports ALSA, OSS, PortAudio and PulseAudio), Mac OS 8, Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X (Core Audio), Microsoft Windows (supports DirectSound, Windows Multimedia API and Windows Multimedia Device (MMDevice) API), MorphOS, OpenBSD, Solaris, QNX, and AROS.

The hooker with a heart of gold (also the whore with a heart of gold or the tart with a heart) is a stock character involving a courtesan or prostitute with a hidden integrity and kindness. The character, traditionally female, is usually an example of irony: an allegedly immoral woman who demonstrates virtues absent in a woman morally correct for the role. Characteristics This character is often a pivotal, but peripheral, character in literature and motion pictures, usually giving key advice or serving as a go-between. She is sometimes established in contrast to another female character who is morally correct but frigid or otherwise unyielding. Hookers with hearts of gold are sometimes reluctant prostitutes due to either desperation or coercion from a pimp. Or her prostitution may reflect an overall lust for life, as in Ilya in Never on Sunday. The stereotype might owe something of a debt to certain traditions surrounding the Biblical figures of Mary Magdalene (who was not a prostitute) and Rahab, or to the ancient Indian theatrical tradition of Sanskrit drama where Śudraka's play Mṛcchakatika (The Little Clay Cart) featured a nagarvadhu (courtesan) with a heart of gold named Vasantasena. But this stock character is pervasive enough in various myths and cultures in the form of a tragic story of the concubine who falls in love with her patron/client or, alternatively, young and often poor lover. Therefore, this might be considered not just an archetype but also fairly universal, and somewhat indicative of various societies' complex ideas about sexual decency and moral character. A variation on the theme, the dancer (stripper) with a heart of gold, is a tamer version of the character. The fictitious courtesan Chandramukhi in Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's highly acclaimed Bengali novel Devdas has been adapted into film numerous times, most notably into Hindi in 1955 and 2002 with the character-role of \\"Chandramukhi\\" being played by actresses Vyjayanthimala and Madhuri Dixit, respectively. Chandramukhi here fulfils Devdas' desire of feeling loved which was betrayed by Parvati (Paro). In opera and musical theater, a hooker with a heart of gold is most often portrayed by a mezzo- soprano. (One notable exception is the heroine of Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata, Violetta Valery, portrayed by a soprano.) She is portrayed in a tragic light and often dies a tragic death. Another classic example of the \\"Tart with a heart\\" character is the character of Nancy in Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist and the stage musical derived from it, Oliver!. In television history, the \\"tart with a heart\\" has become an important archetype in serial drama and soap opera, especially in Britain. During the 1960s, the character of Elsie Tanner in British series Coronation Street set the mold for future characters such as Bet Lynch, Carla Connor, (both also Coronation Street), Kat Slater, Stacey Slater and Dawn Swann (all three characters from the British soap opera EastEnders). Characters of this nature are often depicted as having tragic lives, but put on a front when in public to create the illusion of happiness. More often than not, these female characters are vital to their respective shows, and inevitably become some of the biggest stars in British Television. The hooker with a heart of gold is also a prominent character in many American western movies. In The Usual Suspects, detective Dave Kujan says to Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint: \\"... so don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold.\\" Examples The story of Rahab in the Bible's Book of Joshua is considered by some the earliest example of this character type. * Aldonza/Dulcinea (Sophia Loren) in Man of La Mancha * Belle Watling Gone with the Wind * Bianca in Othello * Cabiria Ceccarelli (Giulietta Masina) in Nights of Cabiria * Chandramukhi (portrayed in film adaptations by Vyjayanthimala, Madhuri Dixit, Kalki Koechlin and others) in Devdas is a courtesan with a heart of gold * Charity Hope Valentine in Sweet Charity is a taxi dancer with a heart of gold. * Daisy in Californication * Dallas in Stagecoach * Donna Beck (Candice Earley) on All My Children * Danielle from The Girl Next Door is a former porn star with a heart of gold. * Goldie in Sin City * Gulabo (Waheeda Rehman) in Pyaasa * Lady Heather (Heather Kessler) (Melinda Clarke), a professional dominatrix in CSI Las Vegas * Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado) in High Noon * Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino) in Mighty Aphrodite * Lucy from the Broadway musical Jekyll & Hyde * Luenell in Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan * Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) in L.A.

Early life  Michael Checkland was educated at the state grammar school King Edward VI Five Ways in Birmingham, and Wadham College, Oxford, of which he was appointed an Honorary Fellow in 1989. After leaving Oxford he worked first as an auditor at Parkinson Cowan Ltd and then as an accountant at Thorn.  Career at the BBC 1964-87  Checkland joined the BBC in 1964 as a senior cost accountant and in 1969 he was promoted to be head of the Central Finance Unit and chief accountant for Central Finance Services. In 1971 he moved to BBC TV, where he was successively chief accountant (1971–76), financial controller (1976–77), controller of planning and resource management (1977–82), and director of resources (1982–85). He had meanwhile been a director of Visnews from 1980 until 1985. In 1985 he was appointed Deputy Director-General of the Corporation, and at the same time he became Vice President of the Royal Television Society, a position he retained until 1994. In 1986 he became Chairman of BBC Enterprises, of which he had been a director since 1979. The following year he became Director-General upon the resignation of Alasdair Milne. This appointment coincided with a term of office as President of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association from until 1988.  Director-General of the BBC  As a former BBC accountant (hence his somewhat derogatory nickname \\"Michael Chequebook or Chequebook Checkland\\") he was more cautious and less radical than Milne, and therefore much less unsettling to the Thatcher government. It has been claimed that the exodus to Channel 4 in the early 1990s of dramatists like Dennis Potter and Alan Bleasdale, who had both been responsible for series which caused outrage among Conservatives during the Milne era, had much to do with the relative lack of risk-taking at the BBC under Checkland and his successor John Birt, who was deputy director- general throughout Checkland's reign.  After the BBC  Following his departure from the BBC, Checkland suggested at a Royal Television Society conference that the corporation's governors and the chairman Marmaduke Hussey had been out of touch: they thought, as he put it, that FM (as in FM radio) \\"stood for fuzzy monsters!\\" Chris Horrie & Steve Clarke, Fuzzy Monsters: Fear and Loathing at the BBC, 1994. Following his retirement from the BBC, Checkland became closely associated with the National Children's Homes charity. He has since become involved in a range of other charities and public bodies: Director of the National Youth Music Theatre (1992–2002), Chairman of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (1995–2001), Governor of Westminster College, Oxford (1993–97), Governor of Birkbeck College London (1993–97), Visiting Professor at the International Academy of Broadcasting, Montreux (1995–97), the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors (1994-2000),http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/george-foster-peabody- awards-board-members and Chairman of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (1997–2001). In 1997-8 he was elected Vice-President of the British Methodist Conference, the highest lay position in the church. He is a trustee of Reuters, chairman of Horsham YMCA, chairman of Horsham Arts Festival, chairman of the University of Brighton and a board member of the Wales Millennium Centre. He was a member of the Independent Television Commission from 1997 to 2003, and chairman of Brighton Festival from 1993 to 2002. Michael Checkland now lives in Sussex and has three children.

Life and career  Born on September 10, 1937, in Calgary, Alberta, Morton was the son of a Brigadier General, and the grandson of General Sir William Dillon Otter. A Rhodes Scholar at Keble College, Oxford, Morton was a graduate of the Collège militaire royal de St-Jean, the Royal Military College of Canada, and the London School of Economics. He received his doctorate from the University of London. He spent ten years in the Canadian Army (1954-1964 retiring as a Captain) prior to beginning his teaching career. He was named Honorary Colonel of 8 Wing of the Canadian Air Force at CFB Trenton in 2002. He received the Canadian Forces Decoration in 2004 for 12 years total military service. Morton was the Hiram Mills Professor of History at McGill University, as well as the founding director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, established in 1994, in Montreal, Quebec. Following his retirement, he continued to serve at McGill as a professor emeritus. Prior to that, he was Principal of Erindale College, University of Toronto, from 1986 to 1994. He served as President of the Canadian Historical Association from 1978-1979. Before beginning his teaching career, Morton served as an advisor to Tommy Douglas of the New Democratic Party. From 1964 to 1966, he served as assistant secretary of the Ontario New Democratic Party. After the success of the famous 1964 NDP Riverdale by-election, Morton wrote and published The Riverdale Story, which detailed how the party's organizing and canvassing changed the way campaigns in Canada are run. In the 1970s he worked with David Lewis, Stephen Lewis, and other party leaders to oppose The Waffle, a left-wing faction within the NDP. In the 1980s he informally advised Brian Mulroney of the Progressive Conservatives. Morton was the author of over thirty-five books on Canada, including the popular A Short History of Canada. In 1994 he won the C.P. Stacey Prize for his history of Canadian soldiers during the First World War, When Your Number's Up. He wrote prolifically about the First World War, considering it of great importance in Canadian history. He once wrote: \\"For Canadians, Vimy Ridge was a nation building experience. For some, then and later, it symbolized the fact that the Great War was also Canada's war of independence\\".Desmond Morton, A Military History of Canada: From Champlain to Kosovo, Canada, McClelland and Stewart, 1999 (1985), p.145. In 1996, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. Morton was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1985. Morton's widow Gael Eakin, to whom he was married for 20 years, announced that he died on September 4, 2019, six days short of his 82nd birthday.Desmond Morton, historian and McGill University professor, dead at 81 Published works * \\"French Canada and the Canadian militia, 1868–1914\\", Histoire sociale / Social History 3 (June 1969): 32–50, * \\"Des Canadiens Errants: French Canadian Troops in the North-West Campaign of 1885,\\" Journal of Canadian Studies 5, no. 3 (Aug. 1970): 28–39 * \\"Aid to the Civil Power: The Canadian Militia in Support of Social Order, 1867–1914,\\" Canadian Historical Review 52, no. 4 (Dec. 1970): 407–25. * Ministers and Generals: Politics and the Canadian Militia, 1868–1904, , (1970) * The Last War Drum: The North West Campaign of 1885 (1972) * with R.H.

In mathematics, the look-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows: : 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, ... . To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example: * 1 is read off as \\"one 1\\" or 11. * 11 is read off as \\"two 1s\\" or 21. * 21 is read off as \\"one 2, then one 1\\" or 1211. * 1211 is read off as \\"one 1, one 2, then two 1s\\" or 111221. * 111221 is read off as \\"three 1s, two 2s, then one 1\\" or 312211. The look-and- say sequence was introduced and analyzed by John Conway. The idea of the look- and-say sequence is similar to that of run-length encoding. If started with any digit d from 0 to 9 then d will remain indefinitely as the last digit of the sequence. For d different from 1, the sequence starts as follows: : d, 1d, 111d, 311d, 13211d, 111312211d, 31131122211d, … Ilan Vardi has called this sequence, starting with d = 3, the Conway sequence .

Conway's constant is marked with the Greek letter lambda (λ).  Growth  The sequence grows indefinitely. In fact, any variant defined by starting with a different integer seed number will (eventually) also grow indefinitely, except for the degenerate sequence: 22, 22, 22, 22, …  Digits presence limitation  No digits other than 1, 2, and 3 appear in the sequence, unless the seed number contains such a digit or a run of more than three of the same digit.  Cosmological decay  Conway's cosmological theorem asserts that every sequence eventually splits (\\"decays\\") into a sequence of \\"atomic elements\\", which are finite subsequences that never again interact with their neighbors. There are 92 elements containing the digits 1, 2, and 3 only, which John Conway named after the chemical elements up to uranium, calling the sequence audioactive. There are also two \\"transuranic\\" elements for each digit other than 1, 2, and 3.Ekhad, S. B., Zeilberger, D.: Proof of Conway's lost cosmological theorem, Electronic Research Announcements of the American Mathematical Society, August 21, 1997, Vol. 5, pp. 78–82. Retrieved July 4, 2011.  Growth in length  The terms eventually grow in length by about 30% per generation. In particular, if Ln denotes the number of digits of the n-th member of the sequence, then the limit of the ratio \\\\frac{L_{n + 1}}{L_n} exists and is given by :: \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\frac{L_{n+1}}{L_{n}} = \\\\lambda where λ = 1.303577269034... is an algebraic number of degree 71. This fact was proven by Conway, and the constant λ is known as Conway's constant. The same result also holds for every variant of the sequence starting with any seed other than 22.  Conway's constant as a polynomial root  Conway's constant is the unique positive real root of the following polynomial: : \\\\begin{align} &\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, x^{71} && &&\\\\- x^{69} &&\\\\- 2x^{68} &&\\\\- x^{67} &&\\\\+ 2x^{66} &&\\\\+ 2x^{65} &&\\\\+ x^{64} &&\\\\- x^{63} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\- x^{62} &&\\\\- x^{61} &&\\\\- x^{60} &&\\\\- x^{59} &&\\\\+ 2x^{58} &&\\\\+ 5x^{57} &&\\\\+ 3x^{56} &&\\\\- 2x^{55} &&\\\\- 10x^{54} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\- 3x^{53} &&\\\\- 2x^{52} &&\\\\+ 6x^{51} &&\\\\+ 6x^{50} &&\\\\+ x^{49} &&\\\\+ 9x^{48} &&\\\\- 3x^{47} &&\\\\- 7x^{46} &&\\\\- 8x^{45} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\- 8x^{44} &&\\\\+ 10x^{43} &&\\\\+ 6x^{42} &&\\\\+ 8x^{41} &&\\\\- 5x^{40} &&\\\\- 12x^{39} &&\\\\+ 7x^{38} &&\\\\- 7x^{37} &&\\\\+ 7x^{36} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\+ x^{35} &&\\\\- 3x^{34} &&\\\\+ 10x^{33} &&\\\\+ x^{32} &&\\\\- 6x^{31} &&\\\\- 2x^{30} &&\\\\- 10x^{29} &&\\\\- 3x^{28} &&\\\\+ 2x^{27} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\+ 9x^{26} &&\\\\- 3x^{25} &&\\\\+ 14x^{24} &&\\\\- 8x^{23} && &&\\\\- 7x^{21} &&\\\\+ 9x^{20} &&\\\\+ 3x^{19} &&\\\\- 4x^{18} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\- 10x^{17} &&\\\\- 7x^{16} &&\\\\+ 12x^{15} &&\\\\+ 7x^{14} &&\\\\+ 2x^{13} &&\\\\- 12x^{12} &&\\\\- 4x^{11} &&\\\\- 2x^{10} &&\\\\+ 5x^9 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & &&\\\\+ x^7 &&\\\\- 7x^6 &&\\\\+ 7x^5 &&\\\\- 4x^4 &&\\\\+ 12x^3 &&\\\\- 6x^2 &&\\\\+ 3x &&\\\\- 6 \\\\end{align} In his original article, Conway gives an incorrect value for this polynomial, writing − instead of + in front of x^{35}.Ilan Vardi, Computational Recreation in Mathematica However, the value of given in his article is correct.  Popularization  The look-and-say sequence is also popularly known as the Morris Number Sequence, after cryptographer Robert Morris, and the puzzle \\"What is the next number in the sequence 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221?\\" is sometimes referred to as the Cuckoo's Egg, from a description of Morris in Clifford Stoll's book The Cuckoo's Egg.Robert Morris SequenceFAQ about Morris Number Sequence Variations There are many possible variations on the rule used to generate the look-and-say sequence. For example, to form the \\"pea pattern\\" one reads the previous term and counts all instances of each digit, listed in order of their first appearance, not just those occurring in a consecutive block. Thus, beginning with the seed 1, the pea pattern proceeds 1, 11 (\\"one 1\\"), 21 (\\"two 1s\\"), 1211 (\\"one 2 and one 1\\"), 3112 (\\"three 1s and one 2\\"), 132112 (\\"one 3, two 1s and one 2\\"), 311322 (\\"three 1s, one 3 and two 2s\\"), etc. This version of the pea pattern eventually forms a cycle with the two terms 23322114 and 32232114. Other versions of the pea pattern are also possible; for example, instead of reading the digits as they first appear, one could read them in ascending order instead. In this case, the term following 21 would be 1112 (\\"one 1, one 2\\") and the term following 3112 would be 211213 (\\"two 1s, one 2 and one 3\\"). These sequences differ in several notable ways from the look-and-say sequence. Notably, unlike the Conway sequences, a given term of the pea pattern does not uniquely define the preceding term. Moreover, for any seed the pea pattern produces terms of bounded length. This bound will not typically exceed 2 * radix + 2 digits and may only exceed 3 * radix digits in length for degenerate long initial seeds (\\"100 ones, etc\\"). For these maximum bounded cases, individual elements of the sequence take the form a0b1c2d3e4f5g6h7i8j9 for decimal where the letters here are placeholders for the digit counts from the preceding element of the sequence. Given that this sequence is infinite and the length is bounded, it must eventually repeat due to the pigeonhole principle. As a consequence, these sequences are always eventually periodic.

She was President of the Poitou-Charentes Regional Council from 2004 to 2014. She won the 2006 Socialist Party primary, becoming the first woman in France to be nominated as a presidential candidate by a major party. In the subsequent 2007 presidential election, she earned further distinction as the first woman to qualify for the second round of a presidential election, but ultimately lost to Nicolas Sarkozy. In 2008, Royal narrowly lost to Martine Aubry in the Socialist Party's election for First Secretary at the Party's twenty-second national congress. She lost the Socialist Party presidential primary in 2011, and failed in an attempt to win a seat in the National Assembly in the June 2012 parliamentary elections. François Hollande, the former President, is the father of her four children. She was appointed by him to the vice-Chair directorship of the Banque Publique d'Investissement (BPI) in 2013. She served as Minister for Ecology from 2014 to 2017, in the Valls, then Cazeneuve cabinets. Early life Ségolène Royal was born on 22 September 1953 in the military base of Ouakam, Dakar, French West Africa (now Senegal), the daughter of Hélène Dehaye and Jacques Royal, a former artillery officer and aide to the mayor of Chamagne (Vosges). Her parents had eight children in nine years: Marie-Odette, Marie-Nicole, Gérard, Marie-Ségolène, Antoine, Paul, Henri and Sigisbert. After secondary school in the small town of Melle, Deux-Sèvres, Marie-Ségolène attended a local university where she graduated 2nd in her class with a degree in Economics. Her eldest sister then suggested she prepare the entrance exam to the elite Institut d'études politiques de Paris popularly called Sciences Po, which she attended on scholarship. There she discovered politics of class and feminism (\\"Sciences Po\\" at the time was 85% upper-class Parisian, mostly male). In 1972, at the age of 19, Royal sued her father because he refused to divorce her mother and pay alimony and child support to finance the children's education. She won the case after many years in court, shortly before Jacques Royal died of lung cancer in 1981. Six of the eight children had refused to see him again, Ségolène included. Royal, like the majority of France's political elite, is a graduate of the École nationale d'administration. She was in the same class as her former partner of 30 years, François Hollande, as well as Dominique de Villepin (prime minister under Jacques Chirac). Each class year at the ENA receives a nickname to distinguish it: Royal tried to get her peers to name their class after Louise Michel, a revolutionary from the 1870s, but they chose the name \\"Voltaire\\" instead. During her time at the ENA, Royal also dropped \\"Marie\\" from her hyphenated first name.  Political career   Beginnings  After graduating in 1980, she elected to serve as a judge (conseiller) of an administrative court before she was noticed by President François Mitterrand's special adviser Jacques Attali and recruited to his staff in 1982. She held the junior rank of chargée de mission from 1982 to 1988.  Member of the French National Assembly  She decided to become a candidate for the 1988 legislative election; she registered in the rural, Western Deux-Sèvres Département. Her candidacy was an example of the French political tradition of parachutage (parachuting), appointing promising \\"Parisian\\" political staffers as candidates in provincial districts to test their mettle. She was up against an entrenched UDF incumbent, and Mitterrand is said to have told her: \\"You will not win, but you will next time.\\" Straddling strongly Catholic and Protestant areas, that district had been held by conservatives since World War II. She did win against the odds, and remarked: \\"Pour un parachutage, l'atterrissage est réussi.\\" (\\"As far as parachuting goes, the landing was a success\\"). After this election, she served as representative in the National Assembly for the Deux-Sèvres' 2nd constituency (1988–1992, 1993–1997, 2002–2007).  Minister  *Minister of Environment : 1992–1993. *Minister of School Education : 1997–2000. *Minister of Family and Children : 2000–2001. *Minister of Family, Children and Disabled persons : 2001–2002.  President of the region Poitou-Charentes  On 28 March 2004, she obtained 55% in the second round in the regional election in Poitou-Charentes, notably defeating Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's protégée, Élisabeth Morin, in his home region. She was elected president of the region the next week. She kept her National Assembly seat until June 2007, when she chose not to run in the legislative election, in agreement with one of her presidential campaign's promises. She organised a run-off between two contenders; the winner, Delphine Batho, went on to win the district for her and Royal's party.  2007 presidential candidacy  Royal on the trail Kader Arif, the European parliament's rapporteur for ACTA in Toulouse on 13 April 2007 where he was promoting Ségolène Royal's candidacy for the 2007 presidential election. On 22 September 2005 Paris Match published an interview in which she declared that she was considering running for the presidency in 2007. In 2006 the CPE (first employment contract) laws were proposed with large protests as a result. Rather than going to the organised protest, she voted a law in her \\"région\\" whereby no company using that type of contract would receive the Région's subsidies. The government backed down and stated that the law would be put on the statute book, but that it would not be applied. After this event Royal was tipped as the lead contender in what is dubbed the \\"Sarko-Ségo\\" race against Nicolas Sarkozy. Until that time, she had not been thought a likely candidate as she had stayed out of the Socialist Party's power struggles. On 7 April 2006, Royal launched an Internet-led electoral campaign at (\\"Desires for the future\\"), publishing the first of ten chapters of her political manifesto. By the beginning of September, her intentions had become quite clear. She has said that only widespread sexism in the Socialist Party had prevented it from rallying around her candidacy as it would have had she been a man. She announced an official team to promote her campaign on 30 August. At this point, polls showed her to be much more popular than her closest competitor, former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and other Socialist heavyweights Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Jack Lang, another former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and François Hollande. Her status as a presidential candidate became more likely on 28 September 2006, when Lionel Jospin, the Socialist former Prime Minister and a fixture in French politics for nearly three decades, announced that he would not run after all. Jack Lang followed suit. On 16 November, Royal defeated Laurent Fabius and Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the French Socialist Party primary, becoming the party's candidate for the 2007 presidential election. The Socialist party's members voted 60.69% for her and gave a bit under 20% each to the more traditional contenders. She also won in 101 of 104 of the Socialist Party's fédérations, losing only Haute-Corse, Mayotte and Seine-Maritime (the latter being the home region of Laurent Fabius). One of her top advisors, Éric Besson, resigned soon afterwards over a disagreement about the costs of this programme, which he believes could reach €35 billion, while others in the campaign team wanted to delay bringing out that figure.[The figure was equivalent to that of Mr. Sarkozy's but higher than Mr. Bayrou's, who was becoming a key figure in the race.] This led to an unusually bitter fall-out, and Mr Besson writing a book titled Qui connaît Madame Royal ? (Who knows Mrs Royal?), published on 20 March. In it, Besson accuses Royal of being a populist, an authoritarian and a luddite and says that he will not vote for her and hopes that she is not elected. He then went on to join the Sarkozy campaign and was rewarded with a junior position in the next government on 18 May 2007. Following the first round of the presidential election, she faced Nicolas Sarkozy in the second round of voting on 6 May in a two-way runoff. In the final round of voting on Sunday, 6 May, Sarkozy won the presidency with 53% of the vote. Royal conceded defeat and wished Sarkozy the best, requesting he keep her supporters in mind. Royal later revealed she had offered defeated centrist candidate, François Bayrou, the premiership should she be elected.  2008 Socialist Party leadership election  Royal entered the leadership election of the Socialist Party to replace her former common law husband François Hollande as head of the party. She garnered the largest plurality of votes in the first round of voting, but not enough to win outright; she was eventually narrowly defeated in the second round by rival Martine Aubry by the margin of 42 votes. After a vote recount, Aubry was declared the winner 25 November 2008, with the margin widening to 102 votes. Royal has announced her intentions to contest the result. Royal has blamed party leaders and her former partner for her loss in the 2007 election.  2011 Socialist Party presidential primary  Royal ran in the French Socialist Party presidential primary election of 2011, the party's first ever open primary. She arrived 4th in the first round on 9 October 2011 with a mere 6.95% of votes, considerably below the figures suggested by opinion polls.  Defeat in the 2012 legislative election  In 2012, Royal ran for office representing Charente-Maritime's 1st constituency. She lost the election to a dissident Socialist, Olivier Falorni.\\"Large victoire pour le PS, large défaite pour Royal\\", Libération, 17 June 2012 After her separation with Hollande, political relations between them were tense, though they have both stated that they remained friends. In the 2008 Socialist Party leadership election, Hollande backed another candidate, and Royal has blamed him and the party establishment for her 2007 Presidential defeat.  2014 return to government  On 2 April 2014 Royal was appointed Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy in the second cabinet of Prime Minister Manuel Valls,Royal, Montebourg, Hamon... l'équation risquée de Manuel Valls, Le Monde, 2 avril 2014 In January 2015 she was third in line in governmental rank,\\"Les Victimes de la Prise d'Otages de Vincennes Enterrés en Israël,\\" Le Monde, January 13, 2015 after the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Increasingly, commentators have seen Royal as President François Hollande’s stand-in for some important state occasions. When Pope Francis touched down on French soil for the first time in his papacy with a visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2014, Royal was the senior French official there to greet him. After the deadly attacks against a satirical newspaper and a kosher supermarket in January 2015, she traveled to Israel to represent France at the memorial services.Elaine Sciolino (July 28, 2015), Ségolène Royal: A Sort-of Vice President, Not-Quite First Lady New York Times.  2017–2020: Ambassador for the Arctic and Antarctic  When Emmanuel Macron was elected French President in May 2017, Royal hoped to be offered a position in his government but instead was offered the position of Ambassador for the Poles, which she accepted in June 2017. In late 2018 the publication of Royal's book \\"Ce que je peux enfin vous dire\\" (What I can finally tell you) detailing the sexism she had suffered throughout her political career, coincided with a decline in Macron's popularity at the time of the Gilets jaunes protests and resulted in speculation that Royal was contemplating a political comeback. After repeatedly and publicly criticizing Macron's handling of pension reform, it was announced by the Council of Ministers that the Mission to the Poles would be ended, effectively removing Royal from her position, in tandem with an official investigation being launched inquiring about alleged misuse of public funds during Royal's time in office.cite web last1=Méheut first1=Constant title=Macron Fires Ambassador Who Attacked His Pension Plan url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/europe/segolene- royal-macron.html website=nytimes.com accessdate=26 February 2020}} Policies Royal has tended to campaign on family and other socially- oriented issues, rather than on economic or foreign policy issues. For instance, she has mounted campaigns against the exposure of children to violent television shows, including cartoons (see her 1989 book, listed below, Le Ras-le-bol des bébés zappeurs, roughly translated as \\"The Channel-Surfing Kids Are Fed Up\\"), and more generally has taken a stand on several issues regarding family values and the protection of children. Royal stated as part of her 100-point platform that if elected, she would raise the lowest state pensions by five percent, increase the monthly minimum wage to €1,500, raise benefits of handicapped citizens, implement state-paid rental deposits for the poorest citizens, and guarantee a job or job training to every student within six months of graduation. She pledged to abolish a flexible work contract for small companies. She pledged free contraception for all young women and a €10,000 interest-free loan for all young people. Economy Royal opposes movements of jobs between EU countries and outsourcing to developing countries. She pledged to abolish a flexible work contract for small companies. She did not directly address whether additional taxes would need to be raised to fund these programs, stating that they can be paid for by cutting waste in government. She was appointed to the vice-Chair directorship of the Banque Publique d'Investissement, from which position she stated that the \\"BPI's purpose is not to do business nor to make profits\\".latribune.fr: \\"BPI: Ségolène Royal vole la vedette au directeur général\\" 24 Apr 2013 Environment The Socialist Party website states that during her tenure as Minister for the Environment, 1992–1993, Royal campaigned actively and successfully for the \\"Law on the treatment and recycling of Waste\\" (), the \\"Law to preserve the countryside\\" (), a \\"Save our countrysides, savour their products\\" campaign to provide proper labelling for the products of 100 local areas (), and the \\"Law against noise pollution\\" (). She provided compensation for people adversely affected by airport noise. Education During her tenure as Minister-delegate for the Family, Children, and the Handicapped, 2000–2002, Royal was active in the re-launch of the Priority Education Zones program (ZEP / zone d'éducation prioritaire), the creation of a government student lunch program, the implementation of language instruction as a priority in primary schools, the creation of a national home-tutoring program, Heures de Soutien Scolaire, and the creation of programs for parental involvement in schools, \\"la Semaine des parents à l'école\\", and national campaigns for the elections of parent-representatives. She also campaigned for the creation of local education and citizenship education contracts, the \\"Initiatives citoyennes\\" program for teaching children how to live together, the law on \\"Defense of children's rights and campaign against violence in the schools\\" (Loi de juin 1998 relative à la prévention et à la répression des infractions sexuelles ainsi qu'à la protection des mineurs), the \\"Campaign against hazing rituals in higher education\\" (Loi de juin 1998 contre le bizutage), the \\"Campaign against violence and racketeering\\" which included implementation of the \\"SOS Violence\\" telephone number, and the implementation of mandatory civics instruction in secondary schools. In January 2006, she criticised secondary school teachers (workers of state public service) who give private lessons outside school hours, saying that they should spend more time in school. When a bootleg video of the speech surfaced on the Internet in November 2006, the teachers' union SNES rebuffed her, requesting that she renounce her proposal. Family and social affairs Ségolène Royal speaking to a crowd in Nantes In 1989, Royal authored a book called The Channel-Surfing Kids Are Fed-Up,Ségolène Royal, Le ras-le-bol des bébés zappeurs, Robert Laffont, 1989, where she criticised Japanese animation (then dominant in certain TV programs) as poor quality production detrimental for children. Royal favours, and has worked for, the \\"Parental rights and obligations act\\" (Loi sur l'autorité parentale), the \\"Women's rights reform and anonymous childbirth act\\" (l'accouchement sous X), the creation of paternity leave, the creation of 40,000 new spaces in French nursery schools, and Social housing reform. She has been active in campaigns providing for \\"Parental time-off provisions and financial support for child illness care\\", Special education support (parents d'enfants handicapés), \\"Benefit allocations for students starting the new school year\\" (Allocation de rentrée scolaire), and the \\"Prostitution of Minors Act\\" (Loi contre la prostitution des mineurs) which provides penal measures for clients. Royal has supported the \\"Law against child pornography\\", the creation of the association \\"Childhood and the Media\\" (Enfance et média) against violence in the media, the creation of the Plan Handiscole for the education of handicapped children and adolescents and their integration into life at school, programs for mass and individual transportation, and the creation of the program \\"Tourism and the Handicapped\\" (Tourisme et handicap). In 2009, she declared herself to be \\"profoundly shocked\\" by statements of Pope Benedict XVI which claimed that the distribution of condoms will not stop the spread of AIDS. Royal added that \\"the responsibility of any religious leader\\" is to \\"defend the principle of life, and certainly not to urge human beings towards their deaths.\\" When she accepted her nomination as the Socialist presidential candidate, Royal said: \\"There is a strong correlation between the status of a woman and the state of justice or injustice in a country.\\" According to an article in Ms. magazine, French women currently earn 80% of a male counterpart's salary.Wachter, Sarah J. \\"Battle Royal: A French woman campaigns to be Mme la Présidente.\\" Ms. magazine. Spring 2007. pp 24–26. Royal has been a long-standing critic of violence on television. She has voiced opinions in the past linking youth crime to exposure to pornography and television violence. She also described the M6 programme Loft Story, imitating the internationally popular Big Brother TV series, as contrary to principles of human dignity and risking transforming viewers into voyeurs instead of providing quality programming. A law passed in February 2002, introduced by Royal on behalf of the Jospin government, allows some parental authority to be granted to same-sex partners. The law amended Article 377 of the Civil Code in allowing a parent to ask a judge to share his/her parental authority with a partner. Article 377-1, added by the law, ensures that \\"delegation may provide, for the needs of education of a child, that the father and mother, or one of them, shall share all or part of the exercise of parental authority with the third person delegatee\\". In a June 2006 interview with LGBT publication Têtu, Royal said \\"opening up marriage to same-sex couples is needed in the name of equality, visibility and respect\\" and said that if her party formed the next government she would introduce a bill to legalise same-sex marriage and adoption. According to her 2007 campaign website, Royal has advocated a policy of more humane prisons and supports creating better conditions inside penal institutions. The website states that she supports a system of rehabilitating offenders and reintegrating them into society. Foreign policy Royal initially appeared to have few opinions on key subjects, such as the accession of Turkey to the European Union, merely responding, \\"my opinion is that of the French people.\\" On the subject of the Iranian nuclear program, Royal also took conflicting positions. She initially took a very hard line in a televised debate, contending that any nuclear power programme in Iran must be prevented since it would inevitably lead to weapons production. When she was criticised by French politicians for not understanding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty – which gives signatories the right to nuclear power for non-military purposes – Royal softened her position and, through a spokesman, said that a civil nuclear program should be allowed as long as UN inspectors were permitted to conduct spot checks. International tours From December 2006 Royal began travelling abroad extensively, but her efforts were set back by a series of blunders, which her political opponents at UMP were quick to jump on. Middle East In early December 2006 controversy followed a brief tour of the Middle East. Meeting Hezbollah politician Ali Ammar, she took exception to his use of the euphemism \\"Zionist entity\\", but did not take issue with his comparison of the Palestinian territories to France under German occupation during World War II. This attracted criticism in France and in Israel which Royal visited next. However, the French ambassador to Lebanon, Bernard Emié, backed her explanation that she did not hear \\"the offending remarks\\" – the discussion took place via an interpreter supplied by the Lebanese parliament. In the same visit, Royal thanked the minister for being so \\"frank\\" when he described US foreign policy in the Middle East as \\"unlimited American insanity\\". China Royal visited China in January 2007; after speaking with a lawyer in that country she noted to the press that he had pointed out to her that the Chinese legal system was \\"faster\\" than the French one. She was immediately reminded by her opponents at home that the Chinese system orders 10,000 executions each year, and that defence lawyers there must be authorised by the Communist Party. She however brought up with her hosts the fate of three Chinese journalists recently imprisoned, and criticised the \\"meekness\\" of French entrepreneurs in tackling new markets such as China. Royal was criticised by French and international media by what was called \\"mangling the French language\\" in a soundbite delivered on the Great Wall of China. She used the word bravitude instead of the word bravoure, which means bravery. Canada: Support for the Quebec independence movement In January 2007, during a meeting with Quebec opposition leader and Parti Québécois head André Boisclair, she declared her support for the Quebec sovereignty movement in its aim to secede from Canada. Royal said Quebec and France share common values, including \\"sovereignty and Quebec's freedom\\". Soon after, Royal took a phone call from comedian Gérald Dahan pretending to be Quebec Premier Jean Charest, and was tricked into making a quip about Corsica's independence: \\"Not all French people would be opposed.\\" She then added, \\"But don't repeat that or we'll have another scandal on our hands.\\" On Afghanistan On 5 April 2007, when commenting on the kidnapping of two Frenchmen by the Taliban in Afghanistan, Royal called for sanctions to be imposed by the United Nations against regimes like the Taliban. This comment was widely interpreted as indicating that Royal did not understand that the Taliban no longer formed the Afghan government and that she was clueless on international matters. Personal life From the late 1970s, Royal was the partner of François Hollande, former President of France, whom she met at ENA. The couple had four children: Thomas (born 1984), Clémence (born 1985), Julien (born 1987) and Flora (born 1992). They were neither married (considering it too \\"bourgeois\\"The Guardian \\"French Socialist party election overshadowed by love triangle\\" Retrieved 15 September 2011) nor bound by a PACS (pacte civil de solidarité, which provides for a civil union between two adults, regardless of gender), contrary to rumours.Les secrets de Ségolène Royal François et elle : un couple en équilibre A news agency leaked news of their separation in June 2007, on the evening of the legislative election. According to the Guardian, she had asked Hollande \\"to move out of the house\\" and pursue his new love interest \\"which has been detailed in books and newspapers\\" – a reference to a much-discussed chapter by journalists explaining how Hollande was having a long-term affair with a journalist. Royal's eldest son, Thomas Hollande, served as an adviser to her during her presidential candidacy, working on a website designed to appeal to young voters. Her brother Antoine named their brother Gérard Royal as the agent who placed the bomb that sank the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior. But other sources claim that this statement is exaggerated and that Gérard was part of the logistics team.Guerres secrètes à l'Élysée, by Paul Barril, ed Albin Michel, Paris (1996) Royal's cousin Anne- Christine Royal followed the paternal side of the family and has been a candidate of the far-right Front National party at a local election in Bordeaux. Royal was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50 by The Guardian in March 2013.

Subprefects (French: sous-préfets) are responsible for the subdivisions of departments, arrondissements. The office of a prefect is known as a prefecture and that of a sub-prefect as a subprefecture. Prefects are appointed by a decree of the President of the Republic in the Council of Ministers, following the proposal of the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior. Decree 64-805 of July 29, 1964, current version They serve at the Government's discretion and can be replaced at any meeting of the Council. From 1982 to 1988 prefects were called commissaires de la République (the Republic's commissioners) and the sub-prefects commissaires adjoints de la République.See 1982 decree amended by a 1988-02-29 decree. Roles A French prefect The post of prefect was first created in 1800 by then-First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte. Their roles were initially similar to those of the pre- revolutionary intendants.Prefect at Encyclopedia Britannica Prefects were initially charged with supervising local governments in their department, ensuring that taxes flowed to Paris and supervising conscription at the local level.France: The Napoleonic era at Encyclopedia Britannica Currently, the main role of the prefect is defined in article 72 of the Constitution of France: The exact role and attributions are defined in decrees, most notably decrees of 1964, 1982, 2004, each replacing the preceding one. The prefect of the département containing the chef-lieu de région is also the préfet de région, or the prefect of the région. Prefects operate under the Minister of the Interior. Their main missions include. * representing the state to local governments; * security  the coordination of police and gendarmerie forces;  handling major crises;  emergency defence procedures; * safety  the decision to evacuate zones facing natural disasters; the organisation of relief operations; * responsibility for official documents, such as  the production of identity documents, including identity cards and passports;  the issuing of driving licences, and their administrative withdrawal in case of certain offenses;  the application of immigration rules; * ensuring respect for legality: officials working for the prefect verify the legality of decisions made by local governments and submit doubtful cases to administrative courts or to financial auditing courts. Prefects may issue administrative orders in areas falling within the competency of the national government, including general safety. For instance, they may prohibit the use of certain roads without special tyres in times of snow. The prohibition on smoking or leaving the motor running while filling the fuel tank of a motor vehicle is another example of a matter typically decided by a prefectoral administrative order. On official occasions, prefects wear uniforms. For much of the time after 1800, the departments largely functioned as transmission belts for policies developed in Paris. As such, prefects originally had fairly extensive powers of supervision and control over departmental affairs. This was especially true during the First and Second Empires, when even the most trivial local matter had to be referred to the prefect. Since 1982, local government has been progressively decentralized, and the prefect's role has largely been limited to preventing local policies from conflicting with national policy. Special cases * In New Caledonia and French Polynesia, the prefect's roles, with certain differences in status, are fulfilled by a high commissioner; in Wallis and Futuna, by a superior administrator. * The French Southern and Antarctic Lands used to be run by a superior administrator, but since 2004 are run by a prefect. The prefect, however, is not based in the territories, but in Réunion. * Paris, which is both a city (commune) and a department, is an exception. While it has a prefect, who is also prefect of the Île-de-France region, another prefect handles law enforcement in Paris and some surrounding areas, as well many other administrative duties: the Prefect of Police of Paris. In Paris, the law enforcement powers exercised in other French cities and towns by the mayor belong to the Prefect of Police. In 2012, a Prefecture of Police of the Bouches-du-Rhône was also created, seated at Marseille, with similar powers. * The authority of the state over the sea is exercised by the Maritime Prefect of the relevant region. Québec In Québec, a prefect is an unelected administrator of a Municipalité régionale de comté. There is no equivalent of French arrondissements, and instead, the word \\"arrondissement\\" always refers to a submunicipal division with an elected leader.

In October 1984, her escort service was disbanded, and after pleading guilty for promoting prostitution, Barrows wrote a 1986 autobiography, Mayflower Madam: The Secret Life of Sydney Biddle Barrows. A TV movie based on the book starring Candice Bergen was broadcast in 1987 under the title Mayflower Madam. Early life, education and career Barrows comes from the Biddle family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and is descended directly from Mayflower passengers William Brewster, John Howland, and Thomas Rogers. Her father is Donald Byers Barrows, Jr. (born 1926) of Rumson, N.J, and her mother is Jeannette Ballantine, who is now married to Felix Molzer, a musician and director of the Monmouth Arts Center in New Jersey. Barrows attended Stoneleigh-Burnham, a girls' boarding school in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and is an alumna of Fashion Institute of Technology (\\"FIT\\") in New York City. She worked in 1975 as an assistant to Alan Snyder, the bath buyer for Abraham & Straus. She was introduced to the world of high-class prostitution and started her own escort service named Cachet, which existed in New York City from 1979 to 1984. Some of its clients included industrialists, high-powered business executives, lawyers, foreign diplomats, and Arabian oil sheiks. In October 1984, Cachet escort service was shut down, Barrows was arrested, and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office charged her with promoting prostitution. When arrested at her home office on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Barrows identified herself as Sheila Devin; one report describes her as the CEO. The name \\"Mayflower Madam\\" was coined by a New York Post reporter, Peter Fearon, who broke the story of Barrows's Mayflower connections. After her guilty plea, Barrows published a best-selling autobiography, Mayflower Madam: The Secret Life of Sydney Biddle Barrows (1986). Barrows appeared in 1987 on the late- night television series Saturday Night Live with a parody of her book; the sketch included Candice Bergen, who portrayed Barrows in the made-for-TV movie Mayflower Madam (1987). Barrows subsequently wrote two books on sexual etiquette. In late 2008, Barrows finished Uncensored Sales Strategies: A Radical New Approach to Selling Your Customers What They Really Want \\\\- No Matter What Business You're In, co-authored with marketing expert Dan Kennedy.

Haas and for Swiss rower see Ernst Haas (rower). Ernst Haas (March 2, 1921 – September 12, 1986) was an Austrian- American photojournalist and color photographer. During his 40-year career, Haas bridged the gap between photojournalism and the use of photography as a medium for expression and creativity. In addition to his coverage of events around the globe after World War II, Haas was an early innovator in color photography. His images were disseminated by magazines like Life and Vogue and, in 1962, were the subject of the first single-artist exhibition of color photography at New York's Museum of Modern Art. He served as president of the cooperative Magnum Photos, and his book The Creation (1971) was one of the most successful photography books ever, selling 350,000 copies.  Early life and education  Haas was born in Vienna, Austria, on March 2, 1921. He was the son of Ernst Haas, a high-level civil servant, and Frederike Haas-Zipser. He had an older brother named Fritz Haas. Haas was raised in the cultural climate of Vienna before World War II. His parents, who placed great value upon education and the arts, encouraged his creative pursuits from an early age. His father enjoyed music and photography, and his mother wrote poetry and aspired to be an artist. Haas's teachers had him act as a judge, rather than a participant, in artistic competitions among his peers. As a painter, he had particular interest in an artwork's formal qualities, and developed a refined sense of composition and perspective. From 1935 to 1938, Haas attended LEH Grinzing, a private school in Vienna, where he studied art, literature, poetry, philosophy, and science. World War II interrupted his formal education in 1938, when the school was closed following Germany's invasion of Austria. The following year, Haas received his diploma from Rainer Gymnasium. Haas was sent to a German army labor camp, working six hours a day in exchange for two daily hours of school attendance. He left the service in 1940 and returned to Vienna to study medicine. Haas was only able to complete one year of medical school before he was forced out as a result of his Jewish ancestry.  Introduction to photography  Haas was uninterested in learning photography as a child, though his father tried to encourage him. Upon his father's death in 1940, Haas first entered the darkroom, learning to print old family negatives. His interest grew, and he soon began to take his own photographs. Though his formal education was complicated by the war, Haas was an autodidact and worked to learn the medium. In 1941, as the “school photographer” of the Max Reinhardt Film Seminar, he attended technical classes and developed an interest in filmmaking. Haas also took advantage of his family's extensive library, as well as museums and libraries in Vienna. He studied philosophy and poetry, in particular, both of which informed his beliefs about the creative potential for photography. A Poet’s Camera (1949), which combined poetry with metaphoric imagery by artists like Edward Weston, was particularly important to Haas's early development. Many of his first extant photographs—close-ups of plants, water, and natural forms—reflect its influence. Unsure of his career path, Haas realized that photography could provide both a means of support and a vehicle for communicating his ideas. He obtained his first camera in 1946, at the age of 25, trading a 20-pound block of margarine for a Rolleiflex on the Vienna black market. Of the decision, he later said: In 1947 Haas presented his first exhibition at the American Red Cross in Vienna, where he had a part-time position teaching photography to soldiers. Taking a portfolio of his work to Zurich, he drew the interest of Arnold Kübler, an editor for the magazine du. After reviewing his photographs, Kübler introduced Haas to Swiss photographer Werner Bischof’s images of Berlin after the war. Influenced by Bischof's work, Haas began to consider how an image could simultaneously tell a story and function as an autonomous work of art. When Haas returned home, he similarly documented the war’s effects in Vienna.Haas' Homecoming Prisoners, Vienna, 1947 Haas obtained assignments from magazines like Heute, often working with fellow correspondent Inge Morath. In 1947, while scouting locations for a fashion shoot, Haas and Morath witnessed prisoners of war disembarking a train and began documenting their arrival. Haas’s images show the anticipation and grief of people searching for their lost relatives among the survivors. The resulting photo essay, “Homecoming,” was published in both Heute and Life magazine.  Magnum Photos  Warren Trabant showed Robert Capa, the war photographer, Haas's “Homecoming” photographs before they were published. Upon reviewing his work, Capa invited Haas to travel to Paris and join the international photographic cooperative Magnum Photos, then two years old. Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger, David “Chim” Seymour, Werner Bischof, and William Vandivert were already members. At the same time, Haas was offered a staff photographer position at Life. He decided he did not want to be limited by Life’s restrictive scope. Describing his decision in a letter to Life editor Wilson Hicks, Haas wrote “What I want is to stay free, so that I can carry out my ideas... I don’t think there are many editors who could give me the assignments I give myself...”  United States  After carrying out assignments in Vienna and London, Haas conceived an extensive project about America. Visas to the United States were difficult to obtain, but in 1950 Robert Capa appointed him Magnum's U.S. Vice President. With this position, Haas was able to obtain the proper documentation, and he arrived in New York in May of that year. The first images Haas took in the United States showed fellow immigrants arriving at Ellis Island. By the time of Haas's arrival, the streets of New York had already become a popular subject for photographers who sought to document all aspects of life. His approach was less direct and confrontational than that of colleagues such as Lisette Model and William Klein. Wrote critic A.D. Coleman, “[Haas] was a lyric poet pursuing a photographic equivalent of gestural drawing, utilizing such photographic effects as softness of focus, selective depth of field, and overexposure to telling effect.” While Haas would continue traveling for his work, he lived the rest of his life in New York City.  Assignments for Life magazine  In 1952 Haas hitchhiked across the United States to White Sands National Monument in New Mexico, planning to photograph Native Americans. Working with the vast area's changing light and clouds, Haas also photographed symbols, local details, and tourist oddities. His finished photo essay, published by Life as “Land of Enchantment” in a six-page spread, was well received by readers and prompted the magazine to iniate another project. According to writer (and early Magnum employee) Inge Bondi, Haas’ Western chronicle was the first major story he created based on his own instinct and at his own financial risk. Once back in New York, Haas purchased color film to begin a new project. He had experimented with color as early as 1949, but this would be his first opportunity to work with what was still a scarce and expensive medium. Haas spent two months photographing New York, and in 1953 Life published his vivid images. Titled “Images of a Magic City,” the sprawling 24-page story spanned two issues. According to critic Andy Grundberg, these images “brought photography into the precincts of abstract expressionism.”  Technique and innovations in color photography  Haas' La Suerte De Capa, Pamplona, Spain, 1956Though Haas continued to use black-and- white film for much of his career, color film and visual experimentalism became integral to his photography. He frequently employed techniques like shallow depth of field, selective focus, and blurred motion to create evocative, metaphorical works. When he submitted his blurred motion bullfight photos, original at the time, to the lab they said there was a problem and they were unusable. Life ran a 12 page spread. He became interested in, as he put it, \\"transforming an object from what it is to what you want it to be.\\" Beyond the physical place, person, or object he depicted, Haas hoped to reflect the joy of looking and of human experience. Haas supported his adventurous personal work with commercially viable photojournalism, advertising, and motion picture stills photography. While on such assignments, he would make his own photographs, translating his passion for poetry, music, painting, and adventure into color imagery. His reputation on the rise, Haas traveled the world, photographing the U.S., Europe, South Africa, and Southeast Asia in expressionistic color. In the late 1940s, Haas switched from his medium format Rolleiflex to the smaller 35mm Leica rangefinder camera, which he used consistently for the rest of his career. Once he began working in color, he most often used Kodachrome, known for its rich, saturated colors. To print his color work, Haas used the dye transfer process whenever possible. An expensive, complex process most frequently used at the time for advertising, dye transfer allowed for great control over color hue and saturation. As the technology of color photography evolved and improved during this period, audience interest in color imagery increased. Many of the magazines that published Haas’ work, such as Life, improved the quality of their color reproduction, and increasingly sought to include his work in the medium. Despite this progress, many photographers, curators, and historians were initially reluctant to consider color photography as art, given the technology's commercial origins.  Leadership of Magnum  In 1954 Robert Capa, Magnum's first president, was killed while on assignment covering the First Indochina War. That same year, Werner Bischof died in a car accident in the Andes. Following their deaths, Haas was elected to Magnum's board of directors and traveled to Indochina himself to cover the war. After the death of David “Chim” Seymour in Suez in 1959, Haas was named the fourth president of Magnum. He made significant and lasting contributions to the organization as its leader. Haas had a deep understanding of the cooperative's mission and encouraged its members to strive for excellence and innovation. In a letter to the members of Magnum, he wrote:  Exhibitions  In 1962 the Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a ten-year survey of Haas's color photography.\\"Ernst Haas: Color Correction \\", LensCulture, 2012. Retrieved February 23, 2013.Press release for Ernst Haas: Color Photography (1962), reproduced here (PDF), MoMA. Retrieved February 23, 2013. Titled Ernst Haas: Color Photography, the exhibition marked MoMA's first solo-artist retrospective exhibition dedicated to color work, and took place during Edward Steichen’s final year as director of the museum's Department of Photography. It was realized by Steichen’s successor John Szarkowski, and consisted of about 80 prints including Haas’s motion studies and color essays. Of Haas’ revelatory color imagery, Steichen has said, “He is a free spirit, untrammelled by tradition and theory, who has gone out and found beauty unparalleled in photography.” No exhibition catalogue was produced at the time,Rick Poynor, \\"Ernst Haas and the color underground \\", Design Observer Group Observatory, January 19, 2012. Retrieved February 23, 2013. but the original prints exist, allowing a much later \\"re-creation\\" of the exhibition.\\"reCREATION: The first color photography exhibition at MoMA, 1962\\", Opinarte, 2005 Before his solo exhibition at MoMA, Haas had been included in Steichen's exhibition The Family of Man, which premiered in 1955 and traveled to 38 countries.  Advertising and stills photography  Haas was a respected stills photographer for many films, including The Misfits, Little Big Man, Moby Dick, Hello Dolly, West Side Story, and Heaven's Gate. John Huston employed Haas as a second-unit director for his 1966 film The Bible: In the Beginning (a.k.a. The Bible), to visualize the section devoted to creation. In addition to editorial journalism and unit stills work, Haas was also highly regarded for advertising photography, contributing groundbreaking campaigns for Volkswagen automobiles and Marlboro cigarettes, among other clients.  The Creation and other publications  The Creation, by Haas Haas was inspired and fascinated by the natural world, and took photographs of the elements throughout his career. Inspired in part by his involvement in John Huston's 1966 film The Bible, Haas conceived an ambitious, multi-year project to visualize the theme of the Earth's creation, as described in a variety of religious texts, primarily the Old Testament. His book The Creation, first published in 1971, presented 106 color photographs made throughout the world, organized into an expressive, poetic sequence. The book was produced in multiple editions in numerous languages through 1988, selling over 350,000 copies to become one of the best-selling photography books of all time. Haas also issued the monographs In America (1975), In Germany (1977), and Himalayan Pilgrimage (1978). In 1980 Haas published a limited edition portfolio of dye transfer prints from The Creation with Daniel Wolf Press. He also began work on a book devoted to Japan and a project illustrating the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke, whose writings inspired him throughout his life. Posthumous books of Haas’ photographs include: Ernst Haas: Color Photographs (1989); Ernst Haas in Black and White (1992); Ernst Haas (Photo Poche), 2010; and Ernst Haas: Color Correction (2011).  Television appearances and teaching  In 1962, the year of his retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, Haas was invited to write and host The Art of Seeing, a four-hour miniseries for National Public Television, then in its first year. Newsweek magazine praised its success as a television program, for Haas combined seeing with hearing. Throughout the series, Haas demonstrated what makes a successful photograph, illustrating how images can be transformed by the slightest variations of technique, perspective, or choice of tools and materials. Haas also taught frequently at photography workshops, including the Maine Photographic Workshops, the Ansel Adams Workshop in Yosemite National Park, and the Anderson Ranch Arts Center near Aspen, Colorado.  Personal life and family  In 1951 Haas married the Hungarian countess Antoinette Wenckheim. They later divorced, and in 1962 Haas married Cynthia Buehr Seneque, an American editor. They had two children, Alexander and Victoria. Gisela Minke, a German-born airline stewardess, was Haas's companion for many years. She encouraged his interest in Tibet, and their travels resulted in the book Himalayan Pilgrimage. Six years before his death, he met Takiko Kawai, who he credited with introducing him to the culture and traditions of Japan.  Late life and death  In the early 1970s Haas became interested in creating audiovisual slideshows—long sequences of projected imagery with accompanying soundtracks, dissolving from one image into the next. \\"I love music,\\" he explained, \\"and with my audiovisual presentation I can combine music and photography.” After suffering a stroke in December 1985, Haas concentrated on layouts for two books he wanted to publish, one featuring his black and white photographs, the other his color. At the time of his death from a stroke on September 12, 1986, he had been preparing to write his autobiography.  Legacy  In 1958, Haas was listed as one of the 10 greatest photographers in the world by Popular Photography magazine, along with Ansel Adams, Richard Avedon, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Alfred Eisenstadt, Philippe Halsman, Yousuf Karsh, Gjon Mili, Irving Penn, and W. Eugene Smith. He won the Hasselblad Award just before his death.\\"Ernst Haas\\", Hasselblad Foundation. Retrieved February 22, 2013. A number of awards have been created in Haas's honor, including the Ernst Haas Award for Creative Photography by the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP); and the Ernst Haas Photographers Grant, funded by Kodak, at the Maine Photographic Workshops. In 1998 the Ernst Haas Studio archive was sent to London to be housed at the Hulton Getty Picture Library as part of a licensing agreement with Getty Images. In 1999 the Ernst Haas Memorial Collection was established at the Portland Museum of Art in Maine. The Ernst Haas Estate is operated by his children, Alexander Haas and Victoria Haas.

An askari (from Swahili and Arabic عسكري ʿaskarī, meaning soldier, or military) was a local soldier serving in the armies of the European colonial powers in Africa, particularly in the African Great Lakes, Northeast Africa and Central Africa. The word is used in this sense in English, as well as in German, Italian, Urdu and Portuguese. In French, the word is used only in reference to native troops outside the French colonial empire. The designation is still in occasional use today to informally describe police, gendarmerie and security guards.Kamusi Project During the period of the European colonial empires in Africa, locally recruited soldiers designated as askaris were employed by the Italian, British, Portuguese, German and Belgian colonial armies. They played a crucial role in the conquest of the various colonial possessions, and subsequently served as garrison and internal security forces. During both World Wars, askari units also served outside their colonies of origin, in various parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In South Africa the term refers to former members of the liberation movements who defected to the Apartheid government security forces.TRC Final Report, Volume 6, Section 3, Chapter 1 \\"Key Security Force Units Involved in Gross Human Rights Violations\\" Etymology Askari is a loan word from the Arabic (ʿaskarī), meaning \\"soldier\\". The Arabic word is a derivation from the Middle Persian word \\"lashkar\\" meaning \\"army\\". . The word \\"lashkar\\" also is the root of the word Lascar for a South Asian soldier or a person of South Asian origin. Words for \\"(a regular) soldier\\" derived from these words are found in Azeri, Indonesian, Malay, Somali, Swahili, Turkish and Urdu. Belgian colonies In the Belgian Congo, the askaris were organised into the Force Publique. This combined military and police force was commanded by white Belgian officers and non commissioned officers. British colonies Soldiers of the King's African Rifles at the coronation of Edward VII in 1902 The Imperial British East Africa Company raised units of askaris from among the Swahili people, the Sudanese and Somalis. There was no official uniform, nor standardised weaponry. Many of the askaris campaigned in their native dress. Officers usually wore civilian clothes. From 1895 the British askaris were organised into a regular, disciplined and uniformed force called the East African Rifles, later forming part of the multi-battalion King's African Rifles.Armies of the 19thC East Africa Chris Peer, Foundry books 2003 The designation of \\"askari\\" was retained for locally recruited troops in the King's African Rifles, smaller military units and police forces in the colonies until the end of colonial rule in Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda during the period 1961–63. After independence, the term Askari continued to be used to refer to soldiers in former British colonies. German colonies The German Colonial Army (Schutztruppe) of the German Empire employed native troops with European officers and NCOs in its colonies. The main concentration of such locally recruited troops was in German East Africa (now Tanzania), formed in 1881 after the transfer of the Wissmanntruppe (raised in 1889 to suppress the Abushiri Revolt) to German imperial control. The first askaris formed in German East Africa were raised by DOAG (Deutsche Ost-Afrika Gesellschaft—the German East Africa Company) in about 1888. Originally drawn from Sudanese mercenaries, the German askaris were subsequently recruited from the Wahehe and Angoni tribal groups. They were harshly disciplined but well paid and highly trained by German cadres who were themselves subject to a rigorous selection process. Prior to 1914 the basic Schutztruppe unit in Southeast Africa was the Feldkompanie comprising seven or eight German officers and NCOs with between 150 and 200 askaris (usually 160)—including two machine gun teams. Such small independent commands were often supplemented by tribal irregulars or Ruga-Ruga.Moyd, Michelle \\"Askari and Askari Myth\\" in Prem Poddar et al. Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures: Continental Europe and its Colonies, Edinburgh University Press, 2008. They were successfully used in German East Africa where 11,000 askaris, porters and their European officers, commanded by Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, managed to fight a successful guerilla campaign against numerically superior British, Portuguese and Belgian colonial forces until the end of World War I in 1918. The Weimar Republic and pre-war Nazi Germany provided pension payments to the German askaris. Due to interruptions during the worldwide depression and World War II, the parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) voted in 1964 to fund the back pay of the askaris still alive. The West German embassy at Dar es Salaam identified approximately 350 ex-askaris and set up a temporary cashiers office at Mwanza on Lake Victoria. Only a few claimants could produce the certificates given to them in 1918; others provided pieces of their old uniforms as proof of service. The banker who had brought the money came up with an idea: each claimant was handed a broom and ordered in German to perform the manual of arms. Not one of them failed the test.In Treue fest (July 21, 1975) DER SPIEGEL 30/1975, pp. 64–65 File:Askari- Ostafrika.jpgAskari of Ostafrika File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R19361, Deutsch- Ostafrika, Deutsches Feldgeschütz.jpgGermans and Askari during the East African Campaign File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA3049, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Askari beim Übungsschießen.jpgAskari in training File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA7225, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Askari im Kampf.jpgAskari in action (Tanga) File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA7209, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Askari auf dem Marsch.jpgAskari on the march (WWI) File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA6369, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Askari.jpgAskari of Ostafrika File:Deutsch-Ostafrikaner- Ehrenmal in Aumühle.JPGGerman-Ostafrika Memorial in Aumühle Nazi Germany Two Ukrainian askaris at the time of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising During World War II, the Germans used the term \\"askaris\\" for Red Army, predominantly Russian, deserters and POWs who formed units fighting against the Red ArmyReitlinger, Gerald. The SS: Alibi Of A Nation, 1922-1945. Da Capo Press, 1989. at page 126. and in other action on the Eastern front. Western Ukrainian volunteer units like the Nightingale Battalion, Schuma battalions, and the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS were also called Askari. These battalions were used in many operations during World War II. Most of them were either Red Army deserters or anti-communist peasants recruited from Western Ukrainian rural areas under German occupation. Italian colonies The Italian army in Italian East Africa recruited Eritrean and subsequently Somali troops to serve with Italian officers and some NCOs. These forces comprised infantry, cavalry, camel-mounted and light artillery units. Somali personnel were later recruited to serve with Royal Italian Navy ships operating in the Indian Ocean. The Italian askaris (ascari) fought in the Mahdist War, Battle of Coatit, First Italo–Ethiopian War, Italian-Turkish War, Second Italo- Abyssinian War and in the World War II East African Campaign. History Many of the Askaris in Eritrea were drawn from local Nilotic populations, including Hamid Idris Awate, who reputedly had some Nara ancestry. Of these troops, the first Eritrean battalions were raised in 1888 from Muslim and Christian volunteers, replacing an earlier Bashi-bazouk corps of irregulars. The four Indigeni battalions in existence by 1891 were incorporated into the Royal Corps of Colonial Troops that year. Expanded to eight battalions, the Eritrean ascaris fought with distinction at Serobeti, Agordat, Kassala, Coatit and AdwaRaffaele Ruggeri, pages 78-79, \\"Italian Colonial Wars\\", Editrice Militare Italiana 1988 and subsequently served in Libya and Ethiopia. Out of a total of 256,000 Italian troops serving in Italian East Africa in 1940, about 182,000 were recruited from Eritrea, Somalia and the recently occupied (1935–36) Ethiopia. When in January 1941, Allied forces invaded Ethiopia in January 1941, most of the locally recruited ascaris deserted. The majority of the Eritrean Ascaris remained loyal until the Italian surrender four months later. Organisation Initially the Eritrean Ascaris comprised only infantry battalions, although Eritrean cavalry squadrons (Penne di Falco) and mountain artillery batteries were subsequently raised. By 1922 units of camel cavalry called \\"meharisti\\" had been added. Those Eritrean camel units were also deployed in Libya after 1932. During the 1930s Benito Mussolini added some armored cars units to the Ascari. Uniforms Eritrean regiments in Italian service wore high red fezzes with coloured tufts and waist sashes that varied according to each unit. As examples, the 17th Eritrean Battalion had black and white tufts and vertically striped sashes; while the 64th Eritrean Battalion wore both of these items in scarlet and purple. White uniforms were worn for parade (see illustration) with khaki for other duties. The Somali ascari were similarly dressed, though with knee length shorts. Ranks The Eritrean and Somali Ascari had the following ranks, from simple soldier to senior non commissioned officer: Ascari - Muntaz (corporal) - Bulukbasci (lance-sergeant) -Sciumbasci (sergeant). The Sciumbasci-capos (staff- sergeants) were the senior Eritrean non-commissioned officers, chosen in part according to their performance in battle. All commissioned officers of the Eritrean Ascari were Italian.Ascari del tenente Indro (in Italian) Spanish colonies Mariano Fortuny, 1860 As noted above \\"askari\\" was normally a designation used in Sub-Saharan Africa. Exceptionally though, the term \\"askari\\" was also used by the Spanish colonial government in North-West Africa,Book image of Spanish \\"Tropas coloniales\\" in respect not of their regular Moroccan troops (see regulares), but of a locally recruited gendarmerie force raised in Spanish Morocco in 1913.Jose Bueno, page 39\\"Uniformes de las Unidades Militares de la Ciudad de Melilla\\" They were known as the \\"Mehal-la Jalifianas\\". This was the equivalent of the better known Goumiers employed in French Morocco. Indigenous members of the Tropas Nómadas or desert police serving in the Spanish Sahara were also designated as \\"askaris\\", as were the other ranks of the Native Police (Policia Indígena) raised in Melilla in 1909.Jose Bueno, page 48 \\"Uniformes de las Unidades Militares de la Ciudad de Melilla\\" Portuguese colonies In Portuguese West Africa, and most other African colonies of the Portuguese Empire, local askaris were recruited. These were used to keep the peace in the nation-sized colonies. During the 20th century, all the indigenous troops were merged into a Portuguese colonial army. This military was segregated along lines of race, and until 1960 there were three classes of soldiers: commissioned soldiers (European whites), overseas soldiers (black African \\"civilizados\\") and native soldiers (Africans who lived in the Portuguese colonies). These categories were renamed to 1st, 2nd and 3rd class in 1960—which effectively corresponded to the same classification.Coelho, João Paulo Borges, African Troops in the Portuguese Colonial Army, 1961-1974: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique, Portuguese Studies Review 10 (1) (2002), pp. 129–50 Apartheid South Africa During Apartheid, especially during the 1980s, Askari was the term used to describe former members of the liberation movements who came to work for the Security Branch, providing information, identifying and tracing former comrades. A number were also operationally deployed. Former members of the liberation movements became askaris if they defected from the liberation movements of their own accord or if they were arrested or captured. In some cases, attempts were made to ‘turn’ captured uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) or Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) operatives using both orthodox and unorthodox methods during interrogation, often involving torture. Other askaris were MK operatives who had been abducted by the Security Branch from neighbouring states. Several abductees remain disappeared and are believed to have been killed. The threats of death used to ‘turn’ askaris were not idle. During the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, amnesty applications revealed that several operatives were killed for steadfastly refusing to co-operate. Askaris were primarily used to infiltrate groups and to identify former comrades with whom they had trained in other countries. At the Pretoria hearing in July 1999, Mr Chris Mosiane testified: \\"In the initial stages askaris were used as police dogs to sniff out insurgents with white SB [Security Branch members] as their handlers. Black SB were used to monitor the askaris.\\" Askaris were initially treated as informers and were paid from a secret fund. Later, they were integrated into the South African Police at the level of constable and were paid an SAP salary. While deployed in the regions, they were paid an additional amount, which was usually generated by making false claims to a secret fund. After successful operations they usually received bonuses. The askaris used Vlakplaas as an operational base and resided in the townships where they attempted to maintain their cover as underground MK operatives. Although a few askaris escaped, most were far too frightened to attempt it. At his amnesty hearing, Colonel Eugene de Kock testified that he had set up a spy network amongst the askaris and used electronic surveillance. He told the Amnesty Committee that he had also established a disciplinary structure to deal with internal issues and other infractions by askaris and white officers. However, askaris who exceeded their authority in operational situations or criminal matters were seldom punished. Generally askaris were extremely effective. Because of their internal experience of MK structures, they were invaluable in identifying potential suspects, in infiltrating networks, in interrogations and in giving evidence for the state in trials. Post 2003 Iraq War  Askari Monument in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania dedicated to Askari who fought in the East African Campaign of World War I Widely deployed Ugandan private security guards are also designated as askari.Kiswahili Radio Report (in Swahili) Guards were to receive $1,000 monthly salary and an $80,000 bonus if shot, but many have complained that the money was not paid or unfair fees assessed. The guards work for recruiting agencies such as Askar Security Services, which are hired by Beowulf International, a receiving company in Iraq, which subcontracts their services to EOD Technologies, an American company hired by the U.S. Department of Defense to provide security guards for Camp Victory in Baghdad. A Beowulf representative said that 400 of the workers \\"had impressed the US Army with their skill and experience\\", but complained that some of the workers lacked police or security experience and \\"didn't even know how to hold a gun\\". At least eleven other Ugandan recruiters include Dresak International and Connect Financial Services.

He had a long career at the BBC, where he was eventually promoted to Director-General, and was described by The Independent as \\"one of the most original and talented programme-makers to emerge during television's formative years\\". In his early career, Milne was a BBC producer and was involved in founding the current affairs series Tonight in 1957. Later, after a period outside the BBC, he became Controller of BBC Scotland and BBC Television's Director of Programmes. He served as Director- General of the BBC between July 1982 and January 1987, when he was forced to resign from his post by the BBC Governors following several difficult years for the Corporation, which included sustained pressure from the Thatcher government about editorial decisions which had proved controversial. Education Born in India to Scottish parents, Milne was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford. Career Before going to university Milne did his National Service as an officer in the Gordon Highlanders. He joined the BBC in September 1954 as a graduate trainee after his wife spotted a BBC advertisement.Philip Purser Obituary: Alasdair Milne, The Guardian, 9 January 2013 He was taken under the wing of Grace Wyndham Goldie who recruited, trained, guided and encouraged many well-known BBC broadcasters and current affairs executives. Milne was one of the so-called \\"Goldie Boys\\", a group of producers and presenters, which included Huw Wheldon, Robin Day, David Frost, Cliff Michelmore, Ian Trethowan and Richard Dimbleby. Milne was the first television producer to become Director- General.Dan Sabbagh \\"Alasdair Milne, former BBC director general, dies aged 82\\", The Guardian, 9 January 2013 His background was in current affairs and he was a founder producer of Tonight, and became the programme's Editor in 1961. He also worked on programmes such as That Was The Week That Was, one of the most controversial programmes of the 1960s, and The Great War. He was instrumental in bringing the entire Shakespeare canon to television, as well as one of the BBC's most acute comedies, Yes, Minister. Landmark broadcasting events during his time as Director-General included Live Aid, the massive music event precipitated by a BBC news report on famine in Africa. The BBC's new Breakfast Time programme went on air on 17 January 1983, presented by Frank Bough and former ITN newscaster Selina Scott. Milne was full of praise for the show, saying: \\"It was a terrific start. The first Tonight programme was not as good as this.\\" As Director-General, Milne was involved with a series of controversies with the British government. Contentious programme- making included the Nationwide general election special with Margaret Thatcher in 1983, the coverage of the miners' strike of 1984–85, the Real Lives fracas,https://www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/anniversaries/june/real-lives the Panorama libel action, the reporting of the U.S. bombing of Libya and the controversy surrounding the programme Secret Society which took place in light of MI5's vetting of BBC employees. On top of this, Milne had to defend the existence of the BBC to the Peacock Committee, which was considering the future of the BBC. Milne defended the television licence thus: The licence fee survived the negotiations, and the BBC made an expensive and failed attempt to enter satellite broadcasting. In September 1986, Marmaduke Hussey was appointed Chairman of the BBC Governors.Maggie Brown \\"How BBC director general Alasdair Milne was hustled out by Hussey\\", The Guardian, 10 January 2013 Perceived as being Margaret Thatcher's \\"hatchet man\\", he was accused of having been appointed because of her perception that the Corporation was biased towards the left.Caroline Davies \\"Hussey, the man behind BBC shake-up, dies\\", The Daily Telegraph, 28 December 2006 In an unprecedented step, Hussey convinced the Board of Governors that a change of direction was needed, and they forced Milne's resignation. Milne wrote: Alasdair Milne, who later described the governors as a \\"bunch of amateurs\\", resigned in January 1987. Post-resignation comments about the BBC Milne was strongly critical of later BBC Director-General John Birt whom he called \\"blue skies Birt\\". Milne described Birt's thesis on television's so-called 'bias against understanding' as \\"balls, actually\\", and said In October 2004, stories were published implying that he had suggested that alleged dumbing down of the BBC was partly the consequence of the corporation's growing number of female executives: Milne later clarified his position: Personal life He married Sheila Kirsten Graucob in 1954, who was of Danish and Irish ancestry; she died in 1992. The couple had two sons, Ruairidh and Seumas and a daughter, Kirsty (who died in July 2013).Iain Martin \\"Obituary: Kirsty Milne, journalist and academic\\", The Scotsman, 16 July 2013 Alasdair Milne died on 8 January 2013 at age 82 after suffering from a series of strokes.

The same expression can be evaluated using innermost tree reduction, yielding the reduction sequence: : \\\\begin{align} & {} & &((2+2)+(2+2))+(3+3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} &= &((2+2)+4)+(3+3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} &= &(4+4)+(3+3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} &= &(4+4)+6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} &= &8+6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} &= &14 \\\\end{align} Notice that the reduction order is made explicit by the addition of parentheses. This expression could also have been simply evaluated right to left, because addition is an associative operation. Represented as a tree, the expression above looks like this: 300px This is where the term tree reduction comes from. When represented as a tree, we can think of innermost reduction as working from the bottom up, while outermost works from the top down. The expression can also be represented as a directed acyclic graph, allowing sub-expressions to be shared: 300px As for trees, outermost and innermost reduction also applies to graphs. Hence we have graph reduction. Now evaluation with outermost graph reduction can proceed as follows: 200px Notice that evaluation now only requires four steps. Outermost graph reduction is referred to as lazy evaluation and innermost graph reduction is referred to as eager evaluation.  Combinator graph reduction  Combinator graph reduction is a fundamental implementation technique for functional programming languages, in which a program is converted into a combinator representation which is mapped to a directed graph data structure in computer memory, and program execution then consists of rewriting parts of this graph (\\"reducing\\" it) so as to move towards useful results.  History  The concept of a graph reduction that allows evaluated values to be shared was first developed by Chris Wadsworth in his 1971 Ph.D. dissertation. This dissertation was cited by Peter Henderson and James H. Morris Jr. in 1976 paper, “A lazy evaluator”A lazy evaluator that introduced the notion of lazy evaluation. In 1976 David Turner incorporated lazy evaluation into SASL using combinators. SASL was an early functional programming language first developed by Turner in 1972.

The board was formed in December 1928 as a society, registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act. It is a consortium of state cricket associations and the state associations select their representatives who in turn elect the BCCI Chief. Its headquarters are in Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Grant Govan was its first president and Anthony De Mello its first secretary.  History   Early years  In 1912, an all- India cricket team visited England for the first time, sponsored and captained by Maharaja of Patiala. In 1926, two representatives of the Calcutta Cricket Club travelled to London to attend meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference, the predecessor to the current International Cricket Council. Although technically not an official representative of Indian cricket, they were allowed to attend by Lord Harris, chairman of the conference. The outcome of the meeting was the MCC's decision to send a team to India, led by Arthur Gilligan, who had captained England in The Ashes. In a meeting with the Maharaja of Patiala and others, Gilligan promised to press for its inclusion in the ICC if all the promoters of the game in the land came together to establish a single controlling body. An assurance was given and a meeting held in Delhi on 21 November 1927 and was attended by delegates from Patiala, Delhi, United Provinces, Rajputana, Alwar, Bhopal, Gwalior, Baroda, Kathiawar, Central Provinces, Sindh and Punjab. A consensus was reached to create a board for control of cricket in India and on 10 December 1927, a unanimous decision to form a provisional board of control was taken. In December 1928, the BCCI was registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act with six associations affiliated to it. R E Grant Govan was elected as its first president and Anthony de Mello as secretary.Page 44 Indian cricket team toured England in 1932.  Reforms: 2017 Committee of Administrators (CoA)  With the surge of cricket in India, BCCI has become rather notorious for its monopoly and has suffered from corruption allegations. The Supreme Court on 30 January 2017 nominated a four-member panel Committee of Administrators (Vinod Rai, Ramachandra Guha, Vikaram Limaye and Diana Edulji) to look after the administration of the BCCI in order to implement Lodha Committee reforms. Vinod Rai, ex-CAG of India heads the four members panel to look after the administrative duties of the board until the fresh elections are called. Presently Sourav Ganguly is the president of BCCI. On 9 August 2019, the BCCI agreed to adhere to the anti-doping mechanisms governed by the National Anti- Doping Agency. Sunil Joshi, former Indian cricket team spinner was named as Chairman of the national selection panel by the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) of BCCI replacing MSK prasad in that role.  Cricket development and matches   Domestic cricket  The BCCI organises the following domestic cricket competitions:  Men's domestic cricket  * Cooch Behar Trophy * Irani Cup * Deodhar Trophy * Duleep Trophy * Indian Premier League (IPL) * Ranji Trophy * Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy * Vijay Hazare Trophy * Vinoo Mankad Trophy  Women's domestic cricket  * Senior Women's Challenger Trophy * Senior Women's One Day League * Senior Women's T20 Challenger Trophy * Senior Women's T20 League * Women's T20 Challenge (Women's IPL) Finances Clout as world's richest board  Financial clout  The BCCI is India's richest sporting body and the richest cricket board in the world. Most other boards depend on their matches with India for the largest chunk of their income. BCCI does not depend on the Government of India for its finances. In 2020, with US$405 million out of US$1534 million India had 26% share in the ICC FTP income disbursed to 10 test playing nations, while ECB received US$139 million as the second highest earner. In 2020, to revive the financial health of other boards after the global economic decline and the significantly reduced income of most boards due to the COVID-19 pandemic ICC will rejig its FTP to schedule more bilateral matches of others nations with India. Influence over the ICC The BCCI is regarded as cricket's big economic player. In 2009, the ICC and BCCI were in disagreement over the WADA Whereabouts clause. Income Total annual income In 2019-2020 fy, the total annual income of BCCI is estimated to be over INR 3730 crore (US$535 million), including INR 2500 crore (US$345 million) from IPL, INR 950 crores (US$139 million) from bilateral cricket with other nations, and INR 380 crores (US$51 million per year or total US$405 million for 8 years) from India's share of ICC revenue. Revenue streams = ICC income share = In 2020, as per the present present eight-year Future Tours Program (FTP), while India receives a total of US$405 million from ICC, as contrasted with US$139 million to ECB, while US$128 million for each of Cricket Australia, Cricket South Africa, Pakistan Cricket Board, New Zealand Cricket, Sri Lanka Cricket, Cricket West Indies and Bangladesh Cricket Board, and US$94 million for Zimbabwe. =Media rights= From 2018 to 2022 global media rights for IPL is awarded to STAR India for . In 2010, the media rights for 25 neutral venue one-day matches to be played over the next 5 years were awarded to Zee Telefilms for $219.16 million. =Sponsorship rights= From 2016 to 2020 inclusive, the official kit sponsorship rights for 5 years has been awarded to Nike for . Earlier in 2019, BYJU'S became the official Indian cricket team sponsor for a period of four years at a cost of . For each home match BCCI makes INR 60 crore (slightly less than US$8 million) per home match under this sponsorship deal. Expenditure Cricketing infrastructure development On 12 September 2006, BCCI announced that it will spend 1,600 crore over the subsequent one year to upgrade the cricket stadiums around the country. Donations In 2020 March, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly donated 51 crore to the PM CARES Fund to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Players' contracts and welfare Taxation payments In 2018, the total amount of tax 462.22 crore, which was outstanding as on April 1, 2018, was cleared along with interest in September 2018 but The Department of Revenue has issued a notice for tax evasion to the BCCI. The Department of Revenue has asked the BCCI to pay another outstanding income tax worth Rs 1,303 crore, according to details submitted by the Finance Ministry in Parliament in February, 2019. Earlier in 2007-08 although the Income Tax Department withdrew this exemption, BCCI only paid tax amounting to against its tax liability of in the 2009-10 financial year In 2012, BCCI had avoided taxes on its income, claiming exemption as a charitable organisation.  Organisation   President  The current president is Sourav Ganguly who is a former captain of Indian cricket team. Affiliated domestic member boards  Sponsorship controversy  The 2020 VIVO IPL decided to continue to go ahead with Chinese sponsorship even amidst the border standoff between India and China in which 20 Indian soldiers had died. BCCI faced criticism by Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, RSS and others. Calls for boycott of IPL were also announced if IPL retained the Chinese sponsors.

For four years, with a force of about 14,000 (3,000 Germans and 11,000 Africans), he held in check a much larger force of 300,000 British, Indian, Belgian, and Portuguese troops. Essentially undefeated in the field, Lettow-Vorbeck was the only German commander to successfully invade a part of the British Empire during the First World War. His exploits in the campaign have been described by Edwin Palmer Hoyt as \\"the greatest single guerrilla operation in history, and the most successful.\\" However, Lettow-Vorbeck's military successes against the Allies came at a high cost to local civilians. Early life Lettow-Vorbeck's birthplace in Saarlouis Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck was born into the Pomeranian minor nobility, while his father was stationed as an army officer at Saarlouis in the Prussian Rhine Province. He was educated in boarding schools in Berlin and joined the cadet corps at Potsdam and Berlin- Lichterfelde. In 1890, he was commissioned a Lieutenant into the Imperial German Army. According to Robert Gaudi, \\"In Mein Leben von Lettow writes nostalgically of his decade as a junior officer in the Kaiser's Imperial Army: there were Dawn inspections in the biting cold, regimental maneuvers, glimpses of the luminaries of the day - the Kaiser, Crown Prince Friedrich, the 'Man of Gold' Field Marshal Count von Moltke, who was Germany's greatest military strategist, and others. There were drinking parties with fellow officers, card games till all hours, and splendid dances in Berlin - the young women shivering in their off-the-shoulder dresses,the new officers in bright stiff uniforms - followed by the mad rush to catch the last train back to Spandau barracks before the last roll call.\\"Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 36. Lettow-Vorbeck later wrote, \\"I recall an older officer scolding a younger one because he failed to ask a young woman who was without a partner to dance. Offenses against chivalry were not tolerated.\\"Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 37. Lt. von Lettow-Vorbeck was assigned to the Great German General Staff. Military career Captain von Lettow- Vorbeck, stationed in German South-West Africa in 1904 In 1900, Lettow-Vorbeck was posted to China as a member of the international alliance forces to quell the Boxer Rebellion. Although Lettow-Vorbeck was fascinated by the ancient history and elaborate courtesy of Chinese culture, he intensely disliked fighting against guerrillas and considered the war detrimental to the discipline of the German Army. He returned to the German General Staff from China in 1901. Beginning in 1904, he was assigned to German Southwest Africa (now Namibia), during the Herero insurrection and the subsequent genocide. Lettow-Vorbeck saw combat against the Herero at the Battle of Waterberg, which he later called, \\"something rarely encountered in guerilla warfare, a chance to defeat them in a single operation.\\"Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Pages 85-90. When the Nama people also rose against German rule under the leadership of Hendrik Witbooi, Lettow-Vorbeck remained in German Southwest Africa in order to continue fighting. He played a major role in the pursuit of Samuel Morenga. During a 1906 gunfight against Morenga and his men, Lettow- Vorbeck suffered injuries to his left eye, which was left blind, and his chest.Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Pages 93-100. He was then evacuated to South Africa for treatment and recovery.Farwell, The Great War in Africa, p. 106 Leonard Mosley would later write, however, \\"It was from these brilliant and fantastic Hottentots that Lettow-Vorbeck learned the Bushcraft that was to prove of such value to him in his war against the British in East Africa. When [Hottentot guerilla leader] Samuel Isaak was captured and brought in for questioning, it was von Lettow who conducted the interrogations... His questions were how to live off a country which offers no apparent sustenance, how to run in conditions when most men barely have the strength to walk, how to condition the body to go without food or water, and most important of all, how to become so much a part, so absorbed into an unfriendly wilderness that survival is possible as the snakes and land crabs and lizards survive.\\"Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 101. In 1907 Lettow-Vorbeck was promoted to Major and assigned to the staff of XI Corps at Kassel, Hesse. From March 1909 to January 1913, he was commanding officer of the marines of II. Seebataillon (\\"2nd Sea Battalion\\") at Wilhelmshaven, Lower Saxony. In October 1913, the Imperial German army promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel and appointed him to command the German colonial forces, known as the Schutztruppe (protectorate force), in German Kamerun (today's Cameroon, plus a portion of present-day Nigeria). Before he could assume this command, however, his orders were changed and he was posted — with effect from 13 April 1914 — to German East Africa (Tanganyika, the mainland territory of present-day Tanzania). While travelling to his new assignment, Lettow-Vorbeck formed a lifelong friendship with Danish author Karen Blixen (also known by her pen name of Isak Dinesen), who was travelling aboard the same liner. Decades later, she recalled that, \\"He belonged to the olden days, and I have never met another German who has given me so strong an impression of what Imperial Germany was and stood for.\\"Farwell, The Great War in Africa, p. 105 First World War Great War poster of Lettow-Vorbeck leading African soldiers. Above: \\"Colonial Warriors' Donation\\"; below a facsimile of Lettow-Vorbeck's signature Lettow- Vorbeck's plan for the war was relatively simple: knowing that East Africa would only be a sideshow to other theatres of war, he was determined to tie down as many British troops as he could. He intended to keep them away from the Western Front, and in this way to contribute to the German war effort. In August 1914 Lettow-Vorbeck was the commander of a military garrison of 2,600 German nationals and 2,472 African soldiers in fourteen Askari field companies.Farwell, p. 109. Feeling the need to seize the initiative, he disregarded orders from Berlin and the colony's Governor, Heinrich Schnee, who had attempted to achieve neutrality for German East Africa, relying on the Congo Act of 1885, by which the European colonial powers had promised to keep their overseas possessions neutral in any European wars. He thus prepared to repel a major British amphibious assault on the city of Tanga. The attack began on 2 November 1914, and for the next four days the German forces fought the Battle of Tanga. Lettow-Vorbeck then assembled his men and their scant supplies to attack the British railways in East Africa. He scored a second victory over the British at Jassin on 19 January 1915. These victories allowed the Germans to capture much needed rifles and other supplies, in addition to boosting the troops' morale. Lettow-Vorbeck also lost many experienced men, however, including the \\"splendid Captain Tom von Prince\\", whom he could not easily replace.Prince had a Scots father and German mother and was born on Mauritius. After being orphaned, Prince and his sister had been educated in England. Later, his mother's family brought him to Germany, where he and Lettow-Vorbeck were classmates at the Kassel Military Academy (Kadettenanstalt Kassel). Prince eventually settled in the Usambara region of German East Africa. He was recalled to active duty as Hauptmann (captain) and given command of the Askaris of the 13th Field Company and of the 7th and 8th Schützenkompagnies (rifle companies composed mainly of the sons of German settlers). Prince's exploits earned him the nickname Bwana Sakarani — the wild one — from his Askaris. He was killed at Tanga on 4 November 1914. Gaudi 2017, pp. 35, 145–148, 200 Schutztruppe Askari Company (1914) Though casualties were high, Lettow insisted his commanders engage British forces, though they offered few enticing targets. This forced him to conduct raids into British East Africa (later Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia), targeting forts, railways, and communications, still hoping to force the Entente to divert manpower from the main theatre of war in Europe. Realizing the critical needs of guerrilla warfare, he used everything available to him to keep his troops supplied. The Schutztruppe recruited new personnel and expanded its size to some 14,000 soldiers, most of them Askaris. Lettow-Vorbeck's fluency in the Swahili language apparently earned the respect and admiration of his African soldiers. He appointed black officers and reportedly stated that \\"we are all Africans here\\". In one historian's opinion, > \\"It is probable that no white commander of the era had so keen an > appreciation of the African's worth not only as a fighting man but as a > man.\\"Miller, Charles (1974), Battle for the Bundu, The First World War in > East Africa p. 38. The historian Michael von Herff says the loyalty of Askaris during the campaign was due to them having formed a military caste within the colonial structure, which had largely separated itself from its members' tribal roots.They Walk Through The Fire Like The Blondest German – African Soldiers Serving the Kaiser in German East Africa 1888–1918. Michael von Herff MA Thesis, McGill University, Montreal 1991 Königsberg guns on land In 1915, he gained the men and artillery of the German cruiser which had been scuttled in the Rufiji River delta. The cruiser had a capable crew under commander Max Looff, and its artillery pieces, converted to land use, became the largest standard guns used in the East African Theatre. In March 1916 British forces under General J. C. Smuts and the Belgians under Charles Tombeur launched an offensive with 45,000 men near Tabora. Lettow-Vorbeck used the climate and terrain to his advantage, engaging the British on his terms. British reinforcements forced Lettow-Vorbeck to yield territory. Continuing his resistance, Lettow-Vorbeck fought a crucial battle at Mahiwa in October 1917, where he inflicted 2,700 casualties on the British.Miller, p. 287. Lettow- Vorbeck himself lost 519 men killed, wounded, or missing while also running critically low on ammunition, forcing him to withdraw. The British would proceed to recover their losses and continue to hold an overwhelming advantage in numbers of men. For the Schutztruppe, this was serious, for there were no reserves with which to replenish their ranks. After news of the battle reached Germany, however, Lettow-Vorbeck was promoted to major-general (Generalmajor).Hoyt, p. 175; on a comparison chart this rank was equivalent to brigadier general in the British or American armies: i.e., the lowest general- officer rank. The Battle of Ngomano in November 1917 Lettow-Vorbeck thus withdrew to the south, with his troops on half rations and the British in pursuit. On 25 November 1917, his advance column waded across the Ruvuma River into Portuguese Mozambique.A state of war had existed since 9 March 1916 between Germany and Portugal: when neutral Portugal complied with a British demand to confiscate German ships interned in Portuguese ports, Germany reacted by declaring war on Portugal. Having essentially cut their own supply lines, the Schutztruppe caravan became a nomadic tribe. On its first day across the river, the column attacked the newly replenished Portuguese garrison of Ngomano and solved its supply problems for the foreseeable future.Miller, p. 296. The subsequent capture of a river steamer with a load of medical supplies, including quinine, satisfied some of its medical needs as well.Hoyt, p. 214. For almost a year Lettow-Vorbeck's men had lived off whatever was available, mainly provisions captured from the British and Portuguese; they had replaced their old rifles with new equipment and acquired machine guns and mortars after capturing Namakura (Nhamacurra in modern Mozambique) in July 1918.Willmott, World War One, p. 93. General von Lettow- Vorbeck and colonial Governor Heinrich Schnee The war in East Africa set off a chain of events with devastating results for the natives and their German overlords. The invasions caused interruptions throughout the colony, so that the land no longer \\"basked in a climate of plenty.\\"Miller, p. 22. Lettow- Vorbeck considered his first obligation as a military commander that to his army, over the objections of Governor Heinrich Schnee. The governor regarded war as the worst possible calamity to befall German East Africa, \\"[undoing] everything his social and economic reforms had accomplished.\\"Miller, p. 41. Lettow-Vorbeck's strategy, meanwhile, held central giving ground and escaping confrontations with Allied forces. He had thus established food depots along his intended line of march from Neu Moshi to the Uluguru Mountains, writing off famine in neighboring villages as a misfortune of war.Miller, p. 236. Scarcely any aid from Germany could penetrate the British naval blockade to alleviate the enormous supply deficiencies in the area, and only two ships succeeded in running the blockade and reaching the colony. On 14 April 1915, the freighter Kronborg arrived off Tanga at Manza Bay after a two month journey from Wilhelmshaven, and was promptly attacked by the British cruiser HMS Hyacinth. Fortunately for the Germans, Kronborg was scuttled by her captain to avoid a coal fire after repeated hits were scored by the British cruiser, and the ship settled in shallow water. Nearly the entire cargo could then be salvaged.Hoyt, pp. 89–90 However when the steamer Marie von Stettin arrived south of Lindi on 17 March 1916,Hoyt, p. 119. its cargo of 1,500 tons was of only very modest help to Lettow-Vorbeck's forces.Farwell, p. 276. An attempt in November 1917 to resupply German forces by Zeppelin airship, an operation codenamed \\"the China Show\\", failed. The Zeppelin, LZ 104 (L 59), intended also as a morale-booster to the beleaguered East African troops, was designed to be dismembered on arrival and all its parts cannibalised as spares for the troops - the canvas of its hull used for tents, for example. The airship reached the Sudan, in a single uninterrupted flight from Bulgaria, where it received a message from the German Admiralty that its planned landing area in East Africa was no longer in Lettow-Vorbeck’s hands. Its captain decided to turn back. The British later claimed the about-turn was a result of a fake radio message sent in German by British intelligence in Cairo stating that Lettow-Vorbeck had surrendered, but this has never been proven. By late September 1916, all of coastal German East Africa, including Dar es Salaam and the Central Railway, was under British control. The west of the colony was meanwhile occupied by Belgian forces.Louis, Great Britain and Germany's Lost Colonies 1914–1919, p. 74. In December 1917, the German colony was officially declared an Allied protectorate.Miller, p. 291. Lettow-Vorbeck and his caravan of Europeans, Askaris, porters, women, and children marched on, deliberately bypassing the tribal homelands of the native soldiers in an effort to prevent desertions. They traversed difficult territory. \\"Swamps and jungles ... what a dismal prospect there is in front of me,\\" stated the Allied commander in pursuit, General J. C. Smuts, whose new approach was subsequently not to fight the Schutztruppe at all, but to go after their food supply.Miller, p. 237. When the end of the campaign eventually came, Smuts was in London and General J. L. van Deventer commanded East Africa. His actions were described as \\"a campaign of supreme ruthlessness where a small, well trained force extorted supplies from civilians to whom it felt no responsibility...it was the climax of Africa's exploitation\\".The Boers in East Africa: Ethnicity and Identity, Brian M. Du Toit Lettow-Vorbeck's tactics led to a famine that killed thousands of Africans and weakened the population, leaving it vulnerable to the Spanish influenza epidemic in 1919.Warfare in World History Michael S. Neiberg page 68 In a book published in 1919, Ludwig Deppe, a doctor of medicine who campaigned with Lettow-Vorbeck and who had formerly headed the hospital at Tanga, lamented the tragedy that German forces had imposed on East Africa in their war with the Allies: > \\"Behind us we leave destroyed fields, ransacked magazines and, for the > immediate future, starvation. We are no longer the agents of culture, our > track is marked by death, plundered and evacuated villages, just like the > progress of our own and enemy armies in the Thirty Years' War.\\"Ferguson, > Empire, p. 253. When the worldwide Spanish influenza epidemic swept into eastern Africa in 1918–1919, it struck down thousands of people.Farwell, p. 354. The weakened state of many native Africans, resulting from the war, made them especially susceptible.Miller, p. 329. Lettow-Vorbeck was greatly respected by his white officers, non-commissioned officers and Askaris, and even Allied forces. In the field when rations had to be reduced and supplies dwindled, > \\"It was a measure of the Askaris' loyalty to their commander that they > accepted the cuts and did not desert en masse. Some did desert, of course... > But the German Askaris were by far the most loyal as well as the most > effective, and it all went back to… Lettow-Vorbeck's brand of discipline, > which bound him and his German officers as much as his black soldiers\\".Hoyt, > p. 171. Lettow-Vorbeck surrendering his forces to the British at Abercorn, as drawn by an African artist On 28 September 1918, Lettow-Vorbeck again crossed the Ruvuma River and returned to German East Africa, with the British still in pursuit. He then turned west and raided Northern Rhodesia, evading an ambush that the British had prepared in German East Africa. On 13 November 1918, two days after the Armistice, he took the town of Kasama, which the British had evacuated,\\"The Evacuation of Kasama in 1918\\". The Northern Rhodesia Journal. IV (5) (1961). pp. 440–442. Retrieved 7 March 2007. and continued heading south-west towards Katanga. When he reached the Chambeshi River on the morning of 14 November, the British magistrate Hector Croad appeared under a white flag and delivered a message from South African General Jacob van Deventer, informing Lettow-Vorbeck of the Armistice. Lettow-Vorbeck agreed to a cease- fire at the spot now marked by the Chambeshi Monument in present-day Zambia. He was instructed by the British to march north to Abercorn to surrender his army, arriving there on 25 November.Gore-Browne, Sir Stewart (1954). \\"The Chambeshi Memorial\\". The Northern Rhodesia Journal, 2 (5) pp. 81–84 (1954). Retrieved 18 May 2007.Lettow-Vorbeck, My Life The remains of his army at the time consisted of 30 German officers, 125 German non-commissioned officers and other enlisted ranks, 1,168 Askaris, and some 3,500 porters.Haupt, Deutschlands Schutzgebiete in Übersee 1884–1918, p. 154. Chambeshi Monument, in the Northern Province of Zambia, also called the Chambeshi Memorial and the Lettow-Vorbeck Memorial, commemorates the final cessation of hostilities of the First World War, three days after the Armistice in Europe. After hostilities ended, the British transferred the German POWs to Dar es Salaam for eventual repatriation. Lettow-Vorbeck attempted to ensure decent treatment and as early a release for the German Askaris, imprisoned at Tabora, as possible.Miller, p. 327. Before Lettow-Vorbeck was separated from his Askaris, one of them cried out, > \\"I have been asked to say this to you Bwana General. Where do you go now? > Where you go, we will go with you! And if this is not the time, then wait > until my son grows up to be a warrior and he will take my place and go with > you. We will go with the Bwana General, will we not?\\"Gaudi (2017) page 409. Robert Gaudi writes, > \\"To a man, the Askaris stepped forward, ready to follow the commander to the > ends of the Earth. But von Lettow held them back with a gesture and kept on > marching. His war was over now.\\" Post-war Lettow-Vorbeck at a parade in Berlin in 1919 Lettow-Vorbeck returned to Germany in early March 1919 to a hero's welcome. He led the veterans of the Schutztruppe in their tattered tropical uniforms on a victory parade through the Brandenburg Gate, which was decorated in their honour.Farwell, pp. 355–356. He was the only German commander to successfully invade the British Empire during the First World War.Article 17 of the Armistice did not require his \\"surrender\\" but simply \\"evacuation of all German forces operating in East Africa.\\" [Farwell, p. 353] He remained in the Reichswehr despite attempts to involve him in the politics of the Weimar Republic. Fourteen months after his return to Germany, Lettow-Vorbeck commanded the troops that ended the Spartacist Uprising in Hamburg.Miller, p. 331 However, Lettow-Vorbeck then lost his commission in the Reichswehr in the summer of 1920 following his involvement in the Kapp Putsch. He subsequently worked in Bremen as an import-export manager.Lettow Vorbeck. My Life pp. 142ffFarwell, p. 356. Lettow-Vorbeck (right) as a guest of General Günther von Kluge during army maneuvers in 1935 In June 1926, Lettow-Vorbeck met Richard Meinertzhagen in Bremen, the British Intelligence Corps Colonel with whom he had fought a battle of wits until December 1916, when Meinertzhagen was invalided.Garfield, p. 164. Three years later, Lettow-Vorbeck accepted an invitation to London where he met face-to-face for the first time J. C. Smuts;Garfield, p. 178. the two men formed a lasting friendship. When Smuts died in 1950, Lettow-Vorbeck sent his widow a moving letter of sympathy.Farwell, p. 357. A similar oft-quoted claim states that Lettow- Vorbeck also apologised for the \\"ungentlemanly death\\" of the British hunter Frederick Selous at the hands of one of his snipers; this claim, however, is not supported by any contemporary evidence. Political career In a review of the work on Lettow-Vorbeck by Uwe Schulte-Varendorff, historian Eckard Michels agrees with Schulte-Varendorff that Lettow-Vorbeck showed susceptibility to far right politics and anti-Semitism. Eckard Michels also writes, however, that Lettow-Vorbeck did not seek publicity out of opportunism or greed and only morphed into a public figure because of the society at the time's desire for a reminder of times gone by. Between May 1928 and July 1930, Lettow-Vorbeck served as a Reichstag deputy for the monarchist German National People's Party. He left the party in 1930, after Alfred Hugenberg became the party leader and drew it increasingly into the far right. Lettow-Vorbeck then joined the Conservative People's Party and ran for it in the election of 1930, where he gained the best result of the party in his electoral district of Upper Bavaria, but was not re-elected. He intensely \\"distrusted Hitler and his movement,\\" and approached his relative Hans-Jürgen von Blumenthal with an idea to form a coalition with Der Stahlhelm against the Nazis. This resulted in the Vorbeck-Blumenthal Pact. Nazi Germany Later, when Hitler offered him the ambassadorship to the Court of St James's in 1935, he \\"declined with frigid hauteur\\"; the suggestion for the nomination as ambassador to the Court of St James had come from retired Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen during a visit to Berlin.Miller, p. 331 During the 1960s, Charles Miller asked the nephew of a Schutztruppe officer, \\"I understand that von Lettow told Hitler to go fuck himself.\\" The nephew responded, \\"That's right, except that I don't think he put it that politely.\\" After his blunt refusal, Lettow \\"was kept under continual surveillance\\" and his home office was searched. Thanks to his popularity among the German people, he was promoted to the rank of General for Special Purposes in 1938, at the age of 68, but was never recalled to active service. One of Lettow-Vorbeck's junior officers, Theodor von Hippel, used his experiences in East Africa to form the Brandenburgers, the commando unit of the Abwehr, the German military intelligence service during the Second World War.Lefèvre, Brandenburg Division, pp. 17–29. Die Stunde Null By the end of the Second World War, Lettow-Vorbeck was destitute. His house in Bremen had been destroyed by Allied bombs, and he depended for a time on food packages from his friends Meinertzhagen and Smuts. After the postwar economic boom, however, he enjoyed comfortable circumstances again. In 1953 he visited Dar- es-Salaam, where he was welcomed by surviving Askaris who greeted him with their old marching song Heia Safari! British colonial officials welcomed him with full military honours.This trip was sponsored by the German news magazine Stern. As colonialism came to an end in Africa, several activists for the independence of Tanganyika, who were all the sons of Lettow-Vorbeck's Askaris, came to seek his advice. As there had been violence against the White population in the former colony of German East Africa, Lettow-Vorbeck later recalled that he gave one of them, who later became a government official in independent Tanzania, > \\"a good talking to. I told him not to despise the White people and not to > humiliate them for the mistakes they made. 'We only repudiate the small men, > father,' he replied, 'When the White Man is big enough, as you were big > enough, we continue to respect him.'\\" Lettow-Vorbeck was pleased by this answer, and laughed and slapped his knee when he told Leonard Mosley about the conversation.Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Pages 416-417. Personal life After his return from Africa, Lettow-Vorbeck married Martha Wallroth (1884–1953) in 1919. They had two sons and two daughters: Rüdiger (1921–1940), Arnd (1922–1941), Heloise (1923), and Ursula (1927). Both his two sons, Rüdiger and Arnd von Lettow- Vorbeck, and his stepson Peter Wallroth, were all killed in action serving in the Wehrmacht. Death In 1964, eleven days before his 94th birthday, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck died in Hamburg. The West German government and the Bundeswehr flew in two former Askaris as state guests to attend the funeral.Uwe Schulte-Varendorff, Kolonialheld für Kaiser und Führer. General Lettow-Vorbeck – Mythos und Wirklichkeit (Ch. Links, Berlin 2006), p. 125 Several officers of the Bundeswehr were assigned as an honour guard, and West Germany's Minister of Defence, Kai-Uwe von Hassel, gave the eulogy, saying that the deceased, \\"was truly undefeated in the field\\". Paul von Lettow- Vorbeck was buried in Pronstorf, Schleswig-Holstein, in the graveyard of Vicelin Church. Legacy Relief sculpture at the former Hamburg-Jenfeld barracks In the year of Lettow-Vorbeck's death, 1964, the West German Bundestag voted to give back-dated pay to all surviving Askaris from the German forces of the First World War. A temporary cashier's office was set up in Mwanza on Lake Victoria. Of the 350 former soldiers who gathered, only a handful could produce the certificates that Lettow-Vorbeck had given them in 1918. Others presented pieces of their old uniforms as proof of service. The German banker who had brought the money then had an idea: each claimant was asked to step forward, was handed a broom, and was ordered in German to perform the manual of arms. Not one man failed the test.Miller, p. 333. Four barracks of the Federal German Army, or Bundeswehr, were once named in Lettow- Vorbeck's honour. They were situated at Leer, Hamburg-Jenfeld, Bremen, and Bad Segeberg. Following the recent closure of 178 military installations, the only one remaining is the Lettow-Vorbeck-Kaserne in Leer, East Frisia. The former Hamburg-Jenfeld barracks houses the \\"Tanzania Park\\", a group of large terracotta relief sculptures of Lettow-Vorbeck and his Askari soldiers, now closed to the public.A Monument under Lock and Key: Seeking Germany's Colonial Lieux of Mémoire by George Steinmetz. The Germanic Review, 2009 Another sculpture of Lettow-Vorbeck and the Askaris is on display at Mühlenteich, near the Bismarck memorial at Friedrichsruh.Lettow-Vorbeck und seine Askari In early 2010, the City Council of Saarlouis renamed Von Lettow-Vorbeck-Straße, mainly for Lettow-Vorbeck's involvement in the 1920 Kapp Putsch.\\"Stadtrat beschließt neue Straßennamen\\" Saarbrücker Zeitung, 3 May 2010. In Hanover, \\"Lettow-Vorbeck Straße\\" was renamed \\"Namibia Straße\\". In Wuppertal, Cuxhaven, Mönchengladbach, Halle, Radolfzell and Graz, Austria there are still streets named after General von Lettow-Vorbeck.\\"Lettow-Vorbeck-Straße hat ausgedient\\" Südkurier, 25 October 2012. The dryosaurid species Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki was named after Lettow-Vorbeck. In popular culture Lettow- Vorbeck appears in a 1993 episode of the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. The episode, which was titled \\"The Phantom Train of Doom\\", begins with Indiana Jones as an officer in the Belgian Army during the First World War. Determined to destroy a Schutztruppe armoured train, Indiana takes General von Lettow-Vorbeck (played by Tom Bell) hostage and attempts to return with him behind Allied lines. When the Schutztruppe tracks them down, Indy draws his revolver to shoot the general, but decides to let him go. The general magnanimously gives him a compass so Indiana can find his way back to his lines, and the two part as friends. Lettow-Vorbeck is the protagonist of The Ghosts of Africa, a 1980 historical novel by Anglo-Canadian novelist William Stevenson about the East African Campaign which highlighted the long- distance resupply mission of the German rigid airship L 59. Lettow-Vorbeck also appears as a character in Peter Høeg's short story, \\"Journey into a Dark Heart\\", which is the opening story in his 1990 collection, Tales of the Night. In this story Høeg imagines Lettow-Vorbeck travelling through Africa by train at night accompanied by Joseph Conrad. Much of the history of Lettow-Vorbeck's war campaign in East Africa is detailed in the book Speak Swahili, Dammit! (2011) by James Penhaligon, as well as in a novel of the same year, The Bridge Builders (Brobyggarna in Swedish) by Jan Guillou. A German film, Lettow- Vorbeck: Der deutsch-ostafrikanische Imperativ, was produced in 1984. In the grand strategy video game Hearts of Iron IV, Lettow-Vorbeck is able to be recalled to service if Hitler is deposed and the monarchy has been restored.

Described as the \\"most momentous piece of legislation in the field of railway law to have been enacted since the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854\\", it was passed by Harold Macmillan's Conservative government to dissolve the British Transport Commission (BTC), which had been established by Clement Attlee's Labour government in 1947 to oversee railways, canals and road freight transport. The Act established the British Railways Board, which took over the BTC's railway responsibilities from 1 January 1963 until the passing of the Railways Act 1993. The Act put in place measures that enabled the closure of around a third of British railways the following year as a result of the Beeching report, as the Act simplified the process of closing railways removing the need for pros and cons of each case to be heard in detail. Historical context By the end of 1960, British Railways had accumulated a deficit of some £500 million and the annual rate of increase of the deficit was estimated to be in the region of £100 million. The Act sought primarily to remedy this situation by putting public transport operators on the same footing as private companies, reversing the policy that had been in place since the earliest days of transport law, namely that the carrier was a monopolist to be controlled and regulated by the State for the benefit of the public. New financial management obligations By virtue of Sections 36 and 38 of the Act, some of the debts of the BTC, including the funds invested in the failed 1955 Modernisation Plan, were written off or transferred to the Treasury. The British Railways Board was directed, under Section 22, to run the railways so that its operating profits were \\"not less than sufficient\\" for meeting running costs. The obligation to be self-sufficient was a departure in UK railway legislation and marked an important turning point. Each railway service should pay for itself or at least have the prospect of doing so. The days of general subsidisation of the railways were now clearly over. The change of policy was brought about by the Select committee of the House of Commons on Nationalised Industries, which concluded that the BTC should make its decisions exclusively on considerations of \\"direct profitability\\". Where decisions based \\"on grounds of the national economy or of social needs\\" needed to be taken, the Minister of Transport would be responsible, having sought the approval of Parliament. The railways would now be operated on the principles applicable to a private entrepreneur in a competitive marketplace. In that respect, Section 3(1) provides that it was the duty of the British Railways Board to provide railway services \\"in Great Britain\\" (not 'for') with regard to \\"efficiency, economy and safety of operation\\". Break-up of the British Transport Commission To facilitate the new policy, the BTC was replaced by five new public corporations: *the British Railways Board *the London Transport Board *the British Transport Docks Board *the British Waterways Board *the Transport Holding Company (holding the shares of companies belonging to BTC, including Thomas Cook and Son Ltd and Thomas Tilling) The four Boards inherited the property, liabilities and functions of the BTC, but their activities were to be co-ordinated by the Minister of Transport, rather than a body separate from the government. The Boards needed the consent of the Minister to borrow and for approval for projects involving large sums of money (Sections 19 and 27). New advisory bodies Nationalised Transport Advisory Council Section 55 of the Act created the Nationalised Transport Advisory Council to \\"advise\\" the Minister of Transport on the activities of the five corporations, which would all be represented on the Council. Transport consultative committees The Central Transport Consultative Committee took the place of a similar body that had been created under the Transport Act 1947 to represent users of the railway, and Area Transport Users Consultative Committees covered individual areas of the country. The Committees were to make recommendations relating to the services provided by the four Boards, although their remit did not include the charges and fares. The Minister was not bound to follow any recommendations. Procedure for closure of railway lines A new procedure was set out for the closure of railway lines, Section 56(7) requiring that British Railways gave at least six weeks' notice of their intention to close a line and to publish this proposal in two successive weeks in two local newspapers in the area affected. The notice would give the proposed closure dates, details of alternative transport services (including services which BR was to lay on as a result of closure) and inviting objections to a specified address. A copy of the notice was to be sent to the relevant Area Committee. Rail users affected by a closure could also send their objections to the Area Committee (this was not required to be specified in the Closure Notice) who would then report to the Minister of Transport. The Area Committee would consider the \\"hardship\\" which it considered would be caused as a result of the closure, and recommend measures to ease that hardship. The closure would not then be proceeded with until the Committee had reported to the Minister and he had given his consent to the closure. Based on the report, the Minister could subject his consent to closure to certain conditions, such as the provision of alternative transport services. Reform of the law of transport The four Boards were placed in the position of private companies in respect of their commercial activities. They no longer had the status of common carrier transporting persons and goods for the public benefit, but were now bailees transporting goods and people like a private operator. The main effect of this change was that the Boards were no longer \\"absolutely liable\\" for their operations, i.e. bearing responsibility for loss even in the absence of negligence or fault on their part. Now they could restrict their liabilities in a similar fashion to private operateurs. A consequence was that they could reject passenger and goods consignments and limit the exposure of their liability, and were free to \\"demand, take and recover such charges for their services and facilities, and to make the use of those services and facilities subject to such terms and conditions as they think fit\\" (Section 43), i.e. have total freedom of contract to sell their services, rather than operate via the medium of a statutory process. An exception was made for the London Passenger Transport Area where fares were still fixed by the Transport Tribunal. As one commentator noted, \\"the Act goes much further in giving effect to laissez- faire in the law of transport than English law has ever done at any time since the seventeenth century\\". Railway byelaws Section 67 of the Act enables byelaws regulating the use of the railways to be issued. This provision featured in Boddington v British Transport Police (1998) where the House of Lords recognised the principle that a defendant in criminal proceedings, in this case fined £10 for smoking on a train in violation of a railway byelaw, could challenge the validity of the rule before a court, save where Parliament has indicated that such a challenge is not possible.

This character has appeared with the Green Hornet in film, television, book and comic book versions. Kato was the Hornet's assistant and has been played by a number of actors. On radio, Kato was initially played by Raymond Hayashi, then Roland Parker who had the role for most of the run, and in the later years Mickey Tolan and Paul Carnegie.Harmon, Jim, Radio Mystery and Adventure and Its Appearances in Film, Television and Other Media, McFarland & Company, Inc., 1992. Keye Luke took the role in the movie serials, and in the television series he was portrayed by Bruce Lee. Jay Chou played Kato in the 2011 Green Hornet film. Character history Kato was Britt Reid's valet, who doubled as The Green Hornet's masked driver and partner to help him in his vigilante adventures, disguised as the activities of a racketeer and his chauffeur/bodyguard/enforcer. According to the storyline, years before the events depicted in the series, Britt Reid had saved Kato's life while traveling in the Far East. Depending on the version of the story, this prompted Kato to become Reid's assistant or friend. In the anthology The Green Hornet Chronicles from Moonstone Books, author Richard Dean Starr's story \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay: An Origin Story of Kato\\" explores the character's background and how he ends up living in America, suggesting that Kato met Britt Reid on a later trip back to his homeland while in search of his mother. Radio program and nationality George W. Trendle, the owner of radio station WXYZ in Michigan first created and produced \\"The Green Hornet\\" show in 1936, with the scripts being written by Fran Striker. The show became so popular it ran for nearly two decades and spun off at least two films. This was Trendle and Striker's second big radio hit; their first was \\"The Lone Ranger.\\" In the 1936 premiere of the radio program, Kato was presented as being Japanese. By 1939, the invasion of China by the Empire of Japan made this bad for public relations, and from that year until 1945 \\"Britt Reid's Japanese valet\\" in the show's opening was then simply identified by the announcer as his \\"faithful valet.\\" The first of Universal's two movie serials, produced in 1939 but not released to theaters until early 1940, referred in passing to Kato being \\"a Korean\\". By 1941, Kato had begun to be referred to as Filipino.radio episode \\"Walkout for Profit\\" The Green Hornet Collection, Volume 2, Tape 1, Side B, Wireless, 1995 (original airdate: June 21, 1941, Blue Network)). A long-standing, but false, urban legend maintained that the switch from one to the other occurred immediately after the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor. In serials, Kato was played by Chinese-born American actor Keye Luke. In the 2011 film, Kato (played by Jay Chou) tells Britt Reid that he was born in the Chinese city of Shanghai; Reid replies by saying that he \\"love[s] Japan\\". Television series The televised series of \\"The Green Hornet\\" was created and produced by William Dozier, the owner of Greenway Productions, for ABC. It ran from 1966 to 1967 and was then cancelled after that one season. Van Williams played the Green Hornet and Bruce Lee played Kato. Dozier was also the creator of the more popular \\"Batman\\" television series. Even though he had the Green Hornet and Kato appear on \\"Batman\\" three times, they never acquired a large audience. Kato, as portrayed by Bruce Lee in the television series It was due in part to Bruce Lee's portrayal of this character, that the Green Hornet became more well known, and that the martial arts became more popular in the United States in the 1960s. Indeed, Lee refused to follow the American director's expectation of fisticuff fights and insisted he be allowed to use his martial arts skills.\\"Bruce Lee Steals the Show in 'The Green Hornet'\\" American Heritage Center Blog https://ahcwyo.org/2020/03/16/bruce- lee-steals-the-show-in-the-green-hornet/ They became so popular with the audience that Van Williams, who played the Green Hornet, asked to be taught some moves. In a crossover episode of Batman from the same time and companies, Kato had a battle with Robin that ended in a draw (the same thing happened simultaneously with their senior partners). This was in part because Lee refused to participate in a fight that showed Asian-style martial arts being defeated; the original script had the Green Hornet and Kato being beaten by Batman and Robin. The popular impression Lee made at the time is demonstrated by one of the TV series tie-in coloring books produced by Watkins & Strathmore. It is titled Kato's Revenge Featuring the Green Hornet.Bonnet, Jean Pierre, \\"The Buzz Word\\" (letter to the editor), The Green Hornet, Vol. 2, # 18, February 1993, NOW Comics. The Green Hornet's success in Hong Kong, where it was popularly known as The Kato Show, led to Lee starring in the feature films that would make him a pop culture icon. This show launched Bruce Lee's adult television and film career. In the TV series Kato (portrayed by Bruce Lee) is not at all a mechanic but a professional servant, a highly skilled driver, and a master of the art of war. In all other versions of the story he is also a mechanic, with the creations of both the special automobile, the Black Beauty, and the Hornet's trademark sleeping gas and the gun that delivered it attributed to him. In the television series he also became an expert in martial arts, which was implied in the first film serial with his use of a tranquilizing \\"chop\\" to the back of a thug's neck. Comic book adaptations All Green Hornet comic book adaptations have included Kato. These were produced by Helnit (later Holyoke), Harvey, Dell and, tied into the television version, Gold Key. Beginning in 1989 one, published by NOW Comics, established a continuity between the different versions of the story. In this comic, the TV/Bruce Lee version of Kato was the son of the Kato from the radio stories, and had the given name Hayashi as an homage to the character's first radio actor.Murray, Will, \\"Where Hornets Swarm,\\" Comics Scene, No. 9, October 1989, Starlog Communications International, Inc., p.42. The comic also established a new Kato, a much younger half-sister of the television-based character, Mishi. This female Kato also insisted on being treated as the Hornet's full partner rather than a sidekick. However, the Green Hornet, Inc., soon withdrew approval and this character was replaced with the 1960s version after Vol. 1, #10.Piron, Diane, \\"The Buzz Word\\" (letter column), The Green Hornet, Vol. 1, No. 13, November 1990. Her removal was explained by having the Kato family company, Nippon Today, needing her automotive designing services at its Zurich, Switzerland facility. Mishi would return in Volume 2, appearing sporadically in the new costumed identity of the Crimson Wasp, on a vendetta against the criminal, Johnny Dollar. She eventually revealed (in The Green Hornet Vol. 2, #s 12 & 13, August & September 1992) that he had been an embezzling executive at the Swiss plant, whose actions she unwittingly began to expose. Consequently, he had murdered her fiancé and his daughter in an attack that also caused the unknowingly pregnant Mishi, the main target, to miscarry. In the No. 34, July 1994 issue of that run, she appeared in her \\"Hornet's partner\\" guise one additional time, as the masked Paul Reid attended a gangland meeting; the rules stated that each \\"boss\\" was allowed two \\"boys.\\" During this period, Hayashi became romantically involved with District Attorney Diana Reid, daughter of the original Hornet, who even thought for a while that she had conceived his child. In the final issue, Diana discussed their wedding plans with Mishi. In the last two issues, yet another Kato, a nephew to both of these named Kono, was brought in to allow the aging Hayashi to retire from crime-fighting, but the publisher's ceasing of operations prevented much of him being seen. The Bruce Lee-based Kato was also featured in two of his own spin-off miniseries, written by Mike Baron. The first had him defending a Chinese temple, where he had studied kung fu, from the Communist government, while in the second he took the job of bodyguarding a heroin-addicted rock star. A third solo adventure, also by Baron, was announced and promoted first as another miniseries, then as a graphic novel (now subtitled \\"Dragons in Eden\\"), but was left unpublished when NOW folded. The line featured one other version of the character. The three-issue mini-series The Green Hornet: Dark Tomorrow (June- August 1993) was set approximately one hundred years in the future, and had an Asian-American Green Hornet, real name Clayton Reid, who had been corrupted by power and truly became the crime boss he was supposed to only pretend to be, fighting a Caucasian Kato. Beyond the reversal of ethnicities, the latter added the claim that he and the future Hornet were cousins, and the art's depiction of this Hornet's unnamed paternal grandparents resembles Paul Reid and Mishi Kato. Although the future Kato is not further identified here, a later \\"Reid/Kato Family Trees\\" feature (in The Green Hornet, Vol. 2, # 26, October 1993) gave him the first name Luke. This comic book incarnation gave a degree of official status to a long-standing error about the character, that in his masked identity he is known as Kato. The name was restricted to his private persona in the original radio series, the two movie serials, and most of the television version (there were two slips in this last medium, one on the Batman appearance, the other in the last filmed episode of the Hornet series itself, \\"Invasion from Outer Space, Part 2\\"; this story is well out of sync with the rest of the run, and the writer, director, and even the line producer are people with no other credits on the program). But the NOW comic version made a big point of having the masked assistants called Kato, with the woman at one early point telling the equally new Hornet during their first adventure, \\"While I'm in this funky get-up, call me Kato. It's part of the tradition.\\"The Green Hornet, Vol. 1, No. 7, May 1990, NOW Comics, p. 7. In the Kevin Smith's 2010 revamp of the continuity, Kato is depicted, in modern times, as the elderly but still physically fit valet of the late Britt Reid, killed by a yakuza mobster going by the Black Hornet sobriquet. The elder Kato, in this version a Japanese forced to act Filipino to avoid the suspicions and the racist charges against his people during WWII, retires his identity along with Britt Reid, and both men decide to devote themselves to their families, respectively raising their offspring Britt Reid Jr. and Mulan Kato. After Britt Reid's death, Kato returns in America with Mulan, now the second Kato, to act out the Secret Testament of Britt Reid Sr., who wished, in the event of his death, Kato to destroy every Green Hornet paraphernalia still in his possession and whisk Britt Reid Jr. to Japan, for his safety. However both offspring refuse Reid's and Kato's will: Mulan Kato, now clad in a close variation of her father's original outfit, storms off to confront the Yakuza, and Britt Reid Jr. manages to steal one of the Green Hornet costumes to help her, despite having little training on his own.Green Hornet No. 3 (2010) As the new Kato, Mulan is a strong, physically fit, silent warrior woman, able to perform amazing feats with uncanny strength and precision.Green Hornet No. 2 (2010) Despite having been shown, in her late teens, as a peppy, lively, cheery social butterfly,Kato No. 1 (2010) the adult Mulan Kato is a darker, brooding character who never speaks (despite physically able to do so, Mulan prefers speaking as little as she can to prevent the much talkative Britt Reid Jr., and seemingly everyone else, from talking backKato No. 5 (2010)) and shows little, if no interest at all, for any form of socialization, a thing that seems to distress the second Green Hornet, every bit the suave socialite his father was. In addition, the limited series Green Hornet: Parallel Lives by writer Jai Nitz, will serve as a prequel to the 2011 Green Hornet film, exploring the backstory for the film's version of Kato. In 2013, an eight- issue miniseries called Masks brought together famous heroes from the pulp era. It starred The Shadow, the Green Hornet and Kato, The Spider and Zorro, and was written by Chris Roberson with art by Alex Ross and Dennis Calero. Films In 1975, the Taiwanese actor Bruce Li played Kato in Bruce Lee Against Supermen. A 1994 Hong Kong film, Qing feng xia, starred Kar Lok Chin as a Kato-like masked hero called the Green Hornet (in English subtitles). In one scene, he is reminded of his predecessors, one of whom is represented by a picture of Bruce Lee in his TV Kato costume.. Portrayed in Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story The 1993 American semi-fictionalized film biography Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, in which Jason Scott Lee (no relation) portrayed Bruce Lee, featured scenes involving the filming of the TV series The Green Hornet. Van Williams, who starred in that TV series, appeared in the film as the show's director. Feature films Black Mask is a 1996 Hong Kong action film starring Jet Li. The film is an adaptation of the 1992 manhua Black Mask by Li Chi-Tak. In the film, in homage to The Green Hornet, Black Mask wears a domino mask and chauffeur's cap in the same style as Kato from the series. The Black Mask is even compared to Kato in one scene. In 2002, it was followed by a sequel, Black Mask 2: City of Masks starring Andy On. In the film Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen, released late September 2010 in Asia and early 2011 in the United States, there is a large feature of the Green Hornet. The subplot consist of the main character Chen Zhen (played by Donnie Yen) dressing up as a mask vigilante (based on the Green Hornet's sidekick Kato) to stop Japanese assassinations and to protect the people. The director has mentioned that since Bruce Lee played both Chen Zhen (in the 1972 film Fist of Fury) and Kato (in the 1960s television series The Green Hornet) before, the film was a tribute and dedication to Lee. On June 4, 2008 Sony Pictures announced plans for a feature film of the superhero. Released on January 14, 2011, the film starred Seth Rogen, who took on writing duties along with Superbad co-writer Evan Goldberg. Stephen Chow had originally signed to play Kato, but then dropped out. Taiwanese actor Jay Chou replaced Chow as Kato for the film. In this version, Kato is Chinese and grew up as a poor runaway from his orphanage in Shanghai. He was originally employed by Britt Reid's father James as a car mechanic (also making his coffee with a specially-designed machine he had created for the purpose) before joining Britt on the steps that lead to him becoming the Green Hornet as Britt concluded that they had both been wasting their potential. Kato's martial art skills in this version of the series are so exceptional that he claims that time literally slows down for him when he gets an adrenaline rush in a dangerous situation, as well as his traditional role as mechanic and driver. Although he and Britt have a temporary falling-out when they argue over their respective importance to the \\"Green Hornet\\" concept- Kato acting as the actual action man of the Hornet while Britt is the public face as Kato is too fast for any cameras to see him- they patch up their differences in time to destroy the gang of crime lord Chudnofsky. Deadline.com has reported that Paramount Pictures and Chernin Entertainment have acquired the rights to The Green Hornet and have started preliminary work on developing a reboot with Gavin O'Connor attached to produce and direct the film and Sean O'Keefe writing. On January 29, 2020, Deadline reported that Amasia Entertainment has gained the rights of the Green Hornet. On April 16, 2020, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Amasia has officially teamed with Universal Pictures for the reboot titled Green Hornet and Kato.

His name is an amalgamation of the Rastafarian term for God and that of the Zulu king Shaka Zulu. Career Jah Shaka was born in Clarendon Parish, Jamaica, an area which has produced numerous roots reggae stars, amongst them Toots Hibbert, Everton Blender, Barrington Levy and Freddie McGregor. Jah Shaka started out on the Freddie Cloudburst Sound System as an operator, before setting up his own sound system. By the late 1970s Shaka's system had rapidly gained a large and loyal following due to the combination of spiritual content, high energy rhythms, massive sonority, and his dynamic personal style. That following notably included many of the pioneers of post-punk such as Public Image Ltd and The Slits. In 1980 Shaka played himself in the film Babylon (directed by Franco Rosso, although he directed the scene he appeared in), operating his Sound System in a soundclash at the climax of the story. Shaka stayed true to his spiritual and distinct musical style during the 1980s when many other Sound Systems had started to follow the Jamaican trend towards playing less orthodox styles tending towards slack dancehall music. In 1989, Shaka visited Jamaica and worked with many musicians there, including King Tubby. On 23 September 2000, he suffered numerous injuries during a house fire. In 2002, Jah Shaka appeared before a large crowd in New York City's Central Park. Live footage of Shaka is featured in the documentary All Tomorrow's Parties based on the musical festival, which was released in 2009. The Jah Shaka Sound System continues to appear regularly in London, with occasional tours of the United States, Europe and Japan. Label On his own record label he has released music from Jamaican artists such as Max Romeo, Johnny Clarke, Bim Sherman and Prince Alla as well as UK groups such as Aswad and Dread & Fred. He has released a number of dub albums, often under the Commandments of Dub banner. Artists featured on more recent releases include both established singers like Tony Tuff, and new emerging artists like Rockaway and Principle - who have sung over riddims produced by his son Malachi, known as Young Warrior. Style and influence Shaka's uncompromising \\"Warrior Style\\" has inspired a host of new UK reggae artists and Sound Systems such as Eastern Sher, The Disciples, Iration Steppas, Jah Warrior, Channel One Sound System, Conscious Sounds, The Rootsman, Aba Shanti-I and Zion Train. Non-reggae artists such as Basement Jaxx have cited Jah Shaka as being their best night out ever. Jah Shaka events are renowned for attracting a wide audience from all backgrounds, races and ages. His dances attract numbers previously thought unthinkable for this genre of music. Shaka believes it to be a testament to the quality of the message that he expounds in his choice of music and his Rastafarian beliefs. His followers are known to be vocally ardent, and have developed dance steps that resemble African war dances. Jah Shaka's music has had a profound influence on genres in the UK like Junglist, a ghetto style born out of the UK soundsystem culture. Jah Shaka's son Young Warrior has now started his own sound system, to great acclaim.Drum and Bass is also deeply influenced by Jah Shaka's sound system frequencies, and a number of the DJ's who feature in that genre, such as Congo Natty frequently name check Shaka's sound.Don Letts has also frequently referenced the influence of Jah Shaka on John Lydon and on the punk scene as a whole. Non-musical work Shaka has also established the Jah Shaka Foundation to carry out assistance with projects in Ghana, where the foundation has bought of land in Agri, 30 miles outside of Accra. It has also managed to distribute medical supplies, wheelchairs, library books, carpentry tools, drawing materials and records to clinics, schools and radio stations in the Accra area establishing important links with the local communities. Shaka himself was actually a youth worker years ago, and has regularly been quoted encouraging youths to study geography and history so they know \\"what's happened, where it's happening and who's doing it\\".

Its distinctive breeding call can be heard throughout much of Japan from the start of spring.  Description  The Japanese bush warbler is olive brown above and tending toward dusky colors below. It has pale eyebrows. It has a beak that curves up making it look like it is smiling. The bird is typically in length. Distribution and habitat The Japanese bush warbler is a common year-round resident throughout Japan (except Hokkaidō) and the northern Philippines. In summer the Japanese bush warbler can also be found in Hokkaidō, Manchuria, Korea, and central China. In winter, the bush-warbler can also be found in southern China and Taiwan. It was introduced to Oahu in Hawaii between 1929–1941 and have since spread to other South Eastern islands of the Hawaiian chain.Japanese Bush Warbler Retrieved April 22, 2017 In summer it ranges from low hills to high mountains, preferring bamboo thickets and black pine trees. In winter it seeks cover at lower elevations.  Relationship to humans The propensity of the Japanese bush warbler to sing has led to the birds being kept as cage birds. Robert Young records that to encourage singing the cages of kept birds were covered with a wooden box with a small paper window that allowed only subdued light in.Robert Young. Yedo and Peking. London: John Murray, 1863. viii. 120. Along with the return of the barn swallow the bush warbler's call is viewed by Japanese as a herald of springtime. It is one of the favorite motifs of Japanese poetry, featured in many poems including those in Man'yōshū or Kokin Wakashū. In haiku and renga, uguisu is one of the kigo which signify the early spring. In poetry the bird is associated with the ume blossom, and appears with ume on hanafuda playing cards. There is also a popular Japanese sweet named Uguisu-boru (Uguisu Balls) which consists of brown and white balls meant to resemble ume flower buds. However, the distinctive song is not usually heard until later in spring, well after the ume blossoms have faded. In haiku the bird with this song is known as sasako, and the song is called sasanaki. The beauty of its song led to the English name Japanese Nightingale,Frank Reynolds and Jason A. Carbine. The Life of Buddhism.

An uguisu-jō (jō = woman) is a female announcer at Japanese baseball games, or a woman employed to advertise products and sales with a microphone outside retail stores. These women are employed because of their beautiful 'warbling' voices. They are also employed to make public announcements for politicians in the lead-up to elections. In Japanese architecture there is a type of floor known as \\"uguisubari\\", which is generally translated into English as \\"nightingale floor\\". These floors have squeaking floorboards that resemble the Japanese bush warbler's low chirping, and are meant to be so designed to warn sleepers of the approach of ninja. Examples can be seen at Eikan-dō temple, Nijō Castle and Chion-in temple in Kyoto. The nightingale's droppings contain an enzyme that has been used for a long time as a skin whitening agent and to remove fine wrinkles. It is sometimes sold as \\"uguisu powder\\". The droppings are also used to remove stains from kimono.  Songs  Japanese bush warbler singing. * Song 1 Pi pi pi... kekyo kekyo Hooo- hoke'kyo Hoohokekyo.

The number traditionally assigned to it is based on the order of its publication; it is actually Beethoven's 14th quartet in order of composition. It was premiered (in its original form) in March 1826 by the Schuppanzigh Quartet and dedicated to Nikolai Galitzin on its publication in 1827.  Movements  Beethoven originally wrote the work in six movements, lasting 42–50 minutes, as follows: (Nomenclature: \\"danza tedesca\\" means \\"German dance\\", \\"Cavatina\\" a short and simple song, and \\"Große Fuge\\" means \\"Great Fugue\\" or \\"Grand Fugue\\".) The work is unusual among quartets in having six movements. They follow the pattern of movements seen in the Ninth Symphony and occasionally elsewhere in Beethoven's work (opening, dance movement, slow movement, finale), except that the middle part of the cycle is repeated: opening, dance movement, slow movement, dance movement, slow movement, finale. New finale Negative reaction to the work's final movement at the first performance, and his publisher's urging, led Beethoven to write a substitute for the final movement, a contradanse much shorter and lighter than the enormous Große Fuge it replaced. This new finale was written between September and November 1826 and is the last complete piece of music Beethoven composed before his death in March 1827. It is marked: :Finale: Allegro in B major Beethoven never witnessed a performance of the quartet in its final form; it was premiered on 22 April, 1827, nearly a month after his death. The original finale was published separately under the title Große Fuge as opus 133. Modern performances sometimes follow the composer's original intentions, leaving out the substitute finale and concluding with the fugue. Robert Simpson argues that Beethoven's intentions are best served by playing the quartet as a seven-movement work, with the Große Fuge followed by the replacement finale.https://robertsimpson.org.uk/writings/authored-by- robert-simpson/programme-notes-on-the-beethoven-string-quartets/#lvb- op130op133  In media  The Cavatina (performed by the Budapest String Quartet) is the final piece on the Voyager Golden Record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of Earth's sounds, languages, and music sent into outer space in 1977 with the two unmanned Voyager probes.

The provisions of the Act took effect from the start of 1923. History The British railway system had been built up by more than a hundred railway companies, large and small, and often, particularly locally, in competition with each other. The parallel railways of the East Midlands and the rivalry between the South Eastern Railway and the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway at Hastings were two examples of such local competition. During the First World War the railways were under state control, which continued until 1921. Complete nationalisation had been considered, and the 1921 Act is sometimes considered as a precursor to that, but the concept was rejected; nationalisation was subsequently carried out after the Second World War, under the Transport Act 1947. The form of the Act was developed by former North Eastern Railway executive, the Minister of Transport, Eric Geddes. Geddes favoured privately-owned regional monopolies through amalgamations, and suggested increased worker participation from pre-war levels. Geddes viewed the pre-war competition as wasteful, but was opposed to nationalisation on the grounds that it led to poor management, as well as a mutually corrupting influence between railway and political interests. In his 9 March 1920 Cabinet paper \\"Future Transport Policy\\", he proposed five English groups (Southern, Western, North Western, Eastern and North Eastern), a London passenger group, and separate single groupings for Scotland and Ireland. Geddes' proposals became the 1920 white paper \\"Outline of Proposals as to the Future Organisation of Transport Undertakings in Great Britain and their Relation to the State\\" (Cmd. 787). This suggested the formation of six or seven regional companies; additionally it suggested worker participation on the board of directors of the company.E McGaughey, 'Votes at Work in Britain: Shareholder Monopolisation and the ‘Single Channel’ (2018) 47(1) Industrial Law Journal 76 The white paper was opposed by the Railway Companies' Association (RCA) and MPs representing railway companies' interests. The move to greater worker participation was strongly opposed by the RCA, but supported by the Labour Party. Worker-directors were not included in the final act, being replaced by agreed negotiating mechanisms. The regional groups initially proposed were five in England (southern, western, north-western, eastern, and north- eastern), and a Scottish regional group. Railways serving London were intended to form a separate regional group, but this amalgamation was delayed and took place in 1933. (see London Passenger Transport Act 1933). In 1921 the white paper \\"Memorandum on Railways Bill\\" (Cmd. 1292), suggested four English regional groups and two Scottish groups. Scottish railway companies wished to be incorporated into British groupings, and the RCA proposed five British regional monopolies including the Scottish businesses. After consideration of the Railways Bill it was decided that the Scottish companies, originally destined to be a separate group, would be included with the Midland/North Western and Eastern groups respectively, in order that the three main Anglo- Scottish trunk routes should each be owned by one company for its full length: the West Coast Main Line and the Midland Main Line by the former group, and the East Coast Main Line by the latter. The Act The opening paragraph of the Railways Act of 1921 states: > With a view to the reorganisation and more efficient and economical working > of the railway system of Great Britain railways shall be formed into groups > in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and the principal railway > companies in each group shall be amalgamated, and other companies absorbed > in manner provided by this Act. Part 1 of the act dealt with the terms and procedure of the amalgamations of railway companies. The constituents and subsidiaries of the four groups were set out in the first schedule of the act. Companies that had not formed an amalgamation scheme by 1923 would be amalgamated under terms decided by a tribunal. Part 2 dealt with powers and regulation of the railway companies by the Railway and Canal Commission, part 3 dealt with railway rates, charges and conditions of carriage with powers given to a Railway Rates Tribunal, and part 4 with employee wages and conditions. Parts 5 and 6 dealt with light railways and general clauses respectively, with the general clauses of part 6 including the requirement of the railway companies to provide the Minister of Transport with statistic and financial reports. The third reading of the Act in the House of Commons took place on 9 August 1921, and was passed with a majority of 237 to 62; the act passed through the House of Lords and the Lords' amendments were accepted by the Commons on 19 August and Royal Assent given. The state control of the railways which began under war conditions during World War I were to continue under the Ministry of Transport Act 1919 for a further two years. The Act took effect on 1 January 1923. On that date most of the mergers took place; some had taken place during the previous year. The February 1923 issue of The Railway Magazine dubbed the new companies as \\"The Big Four of the New Railway Era\\". Lines outside the Act A number of joint lines remained outside the Big Four, continuing to be operated jointly by the successor companies. These included the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&GN;), a London, Midland and Scottish Railway/London and North Eastern Railway joint line in eastern England, the largest of the joint railways in terms of route mileage; the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), LMS/LNER joint line in Lancashire and Cheshire, largest in terms of both passenger and freight traffic; and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&DJR;), a joint LMS/SR line in south-western England. The London suburban railway companies, such as the Underground Electric Railways Company of London and the Metropolitan Railway, were also excluded. Later legislation under the London Passenger Transport Act 1933 amalgamated these and London area bus and tram operations into the London Passenger Transport Board (see List of transport undertakings transferred to the London Passenger Transport Board). Other exempted railways were light railways authorised under the Light Railways Act 1896, and similar lines, although some such lines still chose to join the groups. Those lines staying independent were principally those under the influence of Colonel Stephens, who had been instrumental in securing the necessary exemption.

Wopschall, and commissioned on 8 June 1944, Captain Richard B. Tuggle in command. Service history World War II Commissioned just before the thrust into the Mariana Islands, Pasadena completed shakedown and training during the summer of 1944, and on 25 September got underway for the Pacific theater. On 3 November she crossed the International Date Line and, continuing on, joined TF 38, the fast carrier force, at Ulithi at mid-month. She was part of TF38 as it sailed into Typhoon Cobra on 18 December 1944. Through the remainder of the year she participated in that force's operations against Luzon and Formosa in support of the Philippine campaign. In mid-January 1945, as the assault on Luzon pressed forward, the force sailed into the South China Sea and hit Japanese installations and shipping along the Indo-China coast and on Formosa. In February, the ships, now TF 58, moved against the Japanese home islands, then swung southeast to cover the landings on Iwo Jima, during which Pasadena added her guns to the bombardment group and performed patrol duties. Replenished at Ulithi, the force, with Pasadena in the inner screen, sortied again in mid- March to soften the way for the operation \\"Iceberg\\" assault force with strikes on the southern Japanese home islands and the northern Ryukyus in addition to those against the main assault target: Okinawa. At sea for 80 days, Pasadena, as flagship for CruDiv 17, participated in the night bombardments of Minami Daito (28 March and 10 May) and in the continuous strikes against other Japanese positions on Okinawa and Kyūshū (1 April – 30 May). After a brief respite at Ulithi and Leyte in June, the force sortied from Leyte Gulf for its last strikes against the enemy's home islands in early July, and from mid- month to mid-August pounded military and industrial complexes on the Tokyo Plain, northern Honshū, and Hokkaidō in anticipation of heavy resistance to what appeared inevitable—an invasion of Japan. On 15 August, however, Japan accepted surrender terms. Post-war Following the cessation of Pacific hostilities, Pasadena commenced occupation duties. On 23 August she became flagship of TG 35.1, on the 27th she anchored in Sagami Wan, and on 1 September shifted to Tokyo Bay where she witnessed the official surrender ceremony the next day. From then until mid-January 1946, she remained in the Tokyo Bay area supporting the occupation forces. On 19 January she got underway for San Pedro, California, and an overdue overhaul. Training and local operations followed and in September she headed west again. From November to February, 1947, she participated in division exercises in Micronesia, then, after fleet maneuvers in Hawaiian waters, returned to California. For the next year she conducted local operations, including a trip up the Columbia River to Portland, OR for Navy Day 1947 then several months in dry dock at Bremerton, WA. Then, during the summer of 1948, she conducted an NROTC training cruise. On 1 October she got underway again for the Far East. At the end of the month, she arrived at Tsingtao, and until May 1949 operated off the China coast. On 1 June, she returned to California. During the summer, she conducted local exercises, and on 12 September departed Long Beach, California, for Bremerton and inactivation. She decommissioned on 12 January 1950.

Career Ian Trethowan was educated at the independent Christ's Hospital school near Horsham in West Sussex, and started work as a journalist and parliamentary lobby correspondent. He became a presenter for Independent Television News in the late 1950s and early 1960s, co-presenting ITN's coverage of the 1959 general election. He moved to the BBC in about 1963, and was part of Grace Wyndham Goldie's group of heavy hitting journalists which included Richard Dimbleby and Robin Day. Trethowan was a regular presenter of political programmes such as Gallery, Panorama and general election and budget specials. He presented the BBC's tribute programme to President John F. Kennedy on the day of his assassination. A Conservative, and a close friend of the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, Trethowan has been criticised for his support of the Security Service \\"vetting\\" of BBC employees which has often been seen as a means of weeding out leftists in the corporation. Trethowan allowed MI5 to remove half the content from a Panorama documentary made by BBC journalist Tom Mangold, this emerged in December 2011, when 30-year-old British government papers were released. Trethowan told the press at the time that nobody from the government had seen the film or put pressure on the BBC but in fact he had met the heads of Security Service (MI5) and the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), shown them a tape of the programme and invited them to suggest cuts to it. The programme-makers defended their programme and, although changes were made, the transmitted version still annoyed the intelligence agencies.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16358075https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16369440 However, his genuflection to those in power ensured that his five years in charge of the BBC were generally very stable and secure for the organisation. Cautious and conservative-minded, he was responsible for the sacking of Kenny Everett from Radio 1 in 1970 for making a joke suggesting that the wife of John Peyton, the transport minister in the Conservative government, had only passed her driving test because she had \\"slipped the examiner a fiver\\". In 1979, when Trethowan was director-general, the BBC governors scuppered a plan to broadcast Michael Parkinson's chat show three nights a week, probably because the idea seemed too populist. Trethowan's final months at the BBC saw the Thatcher government dissatisfied with what it saw as the corporation's insufficiently patriotic coverage of the Falklands War. From 1987 until his death from motor neurone disease, he was chairman of Thames Television. He was knighted in 1980. In 1994, when announcing her plans to reduce the dominance of received pronunciation and include more regional accents on Radio 3 and Radio 4, Liz Forgan (who then held Trethowan's old post as managing director of BBC network radio) said that she wanted to move away from the attitude she said he had expressed when he heard a Birmingham accent on BBC radio and said \\"What is that sound doing on the BBC?

She was the fifth ship named for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the 1950s, she was commissioned into the Brazilian Navy as Almirante Barroso. Philadelphia was laid down on 28 May 1935 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 17 November 1936; sponsored by Mrs. Huberta F. Earle (née Potter), first lady of Pennsylvania and wife of Governor George H. Earle III, ; and commissioned at Philadelphia on 23 September 1937, Captain Jules James in command. United States Navy Inter-war period After fitting out, the cruiser departed Philadelphia on 3 January 1938 for shakedown in the West Indies followed by additional alterations at Philadelphia and further sea trials off the Maine coast. Philadelphia called at Charleston, South Carolina, on 30 April and hosted President Franklin Delano Roosevelt the first week of May for a cruise in Caribbean waters. The President debarked at Charleston on 8 May, and Philadelphia resumed operations with Cruiser Division 8 (CruDiv 8) off the Atlantic coast. She was designated flagship of Rear Admiral Forde A. Todd, Commander CruDiv 8 (ComCruDiv 8), Battle Force on 27 June. In the following months, she called at principal ports of the West Indies, and at New York City, Boston, and Norfolk, Virginia. Transiting the Panama Canal on 1 June 1939, Philadelphia joined CruDiv 8 in San Pedro, California, on 18 June for Pacific coastal operations. She departed Los Angeles, California, on 2 April 1940 for Pearl Harbor, where she engaged in fleet maneuvers until May 1941. In September 1940, fifteen of the ship's African American mess men wrote an open letter to a newspaper protesting the treatment of African Americans in the Navy. \\"We sincerely hope to discourage any other colored boys who might have planned to join the Navy and make the same mistake we did. All they would become is seagoing bell hops, chambermaids and dishwashers,\\" they wrote. On publication of the letter, the fifteen were confined to the brig. They were later dishonorably discharged. The incident drew protests from hundreds of mess men on other ships as well as anger in the African American community, and led to a series of meetings between Roosevelt and NAACP leaders A. Philip Randolph and Walter White to discuss partial desegregation of the armed forces. Philadelphia stood out of Pearl Harbor on 22 May 1941 to resume Atlantic operations, arriving Boston on 18 June. At this point, she commenced Neutrality Patrol operations, steaming as far south as Bermuda and as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia. She entered Boston Navy Yard on 25 November for upkeep, and was in repair status there when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. World War II 1942 11 days after the Japanese attack, Philadelphia steamed for exercises in Casco Bay, after which she joined two destroyers for anti-submarine patrol to NS Argentia, Newfoundland. Returning to New York on 14 February 1942, she made two escort runs to Hafnarfjörður, Iceland. She then joined units of Task Force 22 (TF 22) at Norfolk on 16 May, departing two days later for an anti-submarine warfare sweep to the Panama Canal. She then returned to New York, only to depart on 1 July as an escort unit for a convoy bound for Greenock, Scotland. The middle of August found her escorting a second convoy to Greenock. Returning to Norfolk on 15 September, she joined Rear Admiral H. Kent Hewitt’s Western Naval Task Force. This force was to land some 35,000 troops and 250 tanks of General George Patton's Western Task Force at three different points on the Atlantic coast of French Morocco. Philadelphia became flagship of Rear Admiral Lyal A. Davidson, commanding the Southern Attack Group. which was to carry 6,423 troops under Major General Ernest N. Harmon, with 108 tanks, to the landing at Safi, Morocco, about 140 mi (220 km) south of Casablanca. Philadelphias task group departed Norfolk on 24 October and set course as if bound for the British Isles. The entire Western Naval Task Force, consisting of 102 ships and spanning an ocean area some 20 × 40 mi (30 × 60 km), combined off Cape Race on 28 October. It was the greatest war fleet sent forth by the United States at the time. The task force swept northward on 6 November, thence changed course toward the Straits of Gibraltar. But after dark, a southeasterly course was plotted towards Casablanca, and shortly before midnight on 7 November, three separate task groups closed three different points on the Moroccan coast. Philadelphia took up its fire support station as the transports offloaded troops in the early morning darkness of 8 November. Shore batteries opened fire at 0428, and within two minutes Philadelphia joined in bombardment of Batterie Railleuse which, with four 5.1 in (130 mm) guns, was the strongest defense unit in the Safi area. Later in the morning, Philadelphia bombarded a battery of three 6.1 in (155 mm) guns about 3 mi (5 km) south of Safi. Spotter planes from the cruiser also got into the act by flying close support missions. One of Philadelphias aircraft discovered and bombed a Vichy French submarine on 9 November in the vicinity of Cape Kantin. The next day, the Vichy submarine Medeuse, one of eight that had sortied from Casablanca, was sighted down by the stern and listing badly to port, beached at Mazagan, north of Cape Blanco. Thought to be the same submarine previously attacked off Cape Kantin, Medeuse was again spotted by a plane from Philadelphia and was subsequently bombed. 1943 Departing Safi on 13 November, Philadelphia returned to New York on 24 November. Operating from that port until 11 March 1943, she assisted in escorting two convoys to Casablanca. She then joined Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk’s TF 85 for training in Chesapeake Bay preparatory to the invasion of Sicily. A convoy escorted by Philadelphia and nine destroyers sortied from Norfolk on 8 June and arrived Oran, Algeria on 22 June, where final invasion staging operations took place. The convoy stood out from Oran on 5 July, and arrived off the beaches of Scoglitti, Sicily shortly before midnight of 9 July. Philadelphia assisted in furnishing covering bombardment as the troops of Major General Troy Middleton’s 45th Infantry Division stormed ashore. By 15 July, she had joined the gunfire support group off Porto Empedocle, where her guns were put to good use. Philadelphia took departure from her gunfire support area on 19 July and steamed to Algiers, where she became flagship of Rear Admiral L. A. Davidson’s Support Force. This TF 88 was formed on 27 July and given the mission of the defense of Palermo, gunfire support to the Seventh Army’s advance along the coast, provision of amphibious craft for \\"leap frog\\" landings behind enemy lines, and ferry duty for heavy artillery, supplies, and vehicles to relieve congestion on the railway and the single coastal road. Philadelphia, , and six destroyers entered the harbor at Palermo on 30 July and the next day commenced bombardment of the batteries near San Stefano di Camatra. Action in the area of Palermo continued until 21 August, when Philadelphia steamed for Algiers. During her operations in support of the invasion of Sicily, the cruiser had provided extensive gunfire support and, in beating off several hostile air attacks, had splashed a total of six aircraft. She touched at Oran, departing on 5 September en route to Salerno. Her convoy entered the Gulf of Salerno a few hours before midnight of 8 September 1943. Philadelphias real work began off the Salerno beaches at 0943 the next day, when she commenced shore bombardment. When one of her scouting planes spotted 35 German tanks concealed in a thicket adjacent to Red Beach, Philadelphias guns took them under fire and destroyed seven of them before they escaped to the rear. Philadelphia narrowly evaded a KG 100-launched glide bomb on 11 September, although several of her crew were injured when the bomb exploded. While bombarding targets off Aropoli on 15 September, the cruiser downed one of 12 attacking planes and assisted in driving off a second air attack the same day in the vicinity of Altavilla. She downed two more hostile aircraft on 17 September and cleared the gunfire support area that night, bound for Bizerte, Tunisia. After upkeep at Gibraltar, Philadelphia departed Oran, Algeria on 6 November as part of the escort for a convoy which arrived at Hampton Roads on 21 November. 1944 Philadelphia underwent overhaul at New York and then engaged in refresher training in Chesapeake waters until 19 January 1944, when she steamed from Norfolk as an escorting unit for a convoy arriving Oran, Algeria on 30 January. Philadelphia joined the gunfire support ships off Anzio on 14 February and provided support for the advancing ground troops through 23 May. On this same day she collided with the . She then sailed to the British naval yard at Malta, where repairs to her bow were effected. After overhaul at Malta, she joined Admiral C. F. Bryant’s Task Group 85.12 (TG 85.12) at Taranto, Italy. The cruiser served as one of the escorting units for the group, which reached the Gulf of Saint-Tropez, France, on 15 August. At 0640, she teamed with and and, with other support ships, they closed the beaches and provided counter-battery fire. By 0815, the bombardment had destroyed enemy defenses, and Major General William W. Eagles’ famed \\"Thunderbirds\\" of the 45th Army Infantry Division landed without opposition. After replenishing ammunition at Propriano, Corsica, on 17 August, Philadelphia provided gunfire support to the French army troops on the western outskirts of Toulon. Four days later, her commanding officer, Captain Walter A. Ansel, accepted the surrender of the fortress islands of Pomeques, Château d'If, and Ratonneau in the Bay of Marseilles. After gunfire support missions off Nice, she departed Naples on 20 October and returned to Philadelphia, Pa., arriving on 6 November. 1945 Philadelphia underwent overhaul at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and then refresher training in the West Indies, returning to Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 June 1945. She steamed for Antwerp, Belgium on 7 July, acting as escort for which had embarked President Harry S. Truman and his party, including Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy. Arriving Antwerp on 15 July, the President departed Augusta and was flown to the Potsdam Conference. Before the conference ended, Philadelphia proceeded to Plymouth, England, to await return of the President. On 2 August, Philadelphia rendered honors to King George VI, who visited President Truman aboard Augusta. The ships departed that same day and Philadelphia arrived Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 August. Post-war Philadelphia stood out of Narragansett Bay for Southampton, England, on 6 September, returning on 25 September as escort for the former German liner Europa. After operations in Narragansett Bay and in Chesapeake Bay, she arrived Philadelphia on 26 October. Steaming for Le Havre, France, on 14 November, she embarked Army passengers for the return to New York on 29 November. She made another \\"Magic Carpet\\" run from New York to Le Havre and return from 5 to 25 December, and arrived at Philadelphia for inactivation on 9 January 1946. Brazilian Navy Philadelphia decommissioned in the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 3 February 1947. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 January 1951, she was sold to the government of Brazil under terms of the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. She served in the Brazilian Navy under the name Barroso (C–11) and was scrapped in 1974. Awards Philadelphia received five battle stars for World War II operations.

The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. Unlike the early Sonata No. 8, Pathétique,Schindler, A. (1970). Biographie von Ludwig van Beethoven. Reprografischer Nachdruck der Ausgabe Münster 1871. Georg Olms Verlag. p. 66 the Appassionata was not named during the composer's lifetime, but was so labelled in 1838 by the publisher of a four-hand arrangement of the work. One of his greatest and most technically challenging piano sonatas, the Appassionata was considered by Beethoven to be his most tempestuous piano sonata until the twenty-ninth piano sonata (known as the Hammerklavier) . 1803 was the year Beethoven came to grips with the irreversibility of his progressively deteriorating hearing. An average performance of the entire Appassionata sonata lasts about twenty-five minutes. Form The beginning of the first movement The sonata, in F minor, consists of three movements: Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterised by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G). This use of the Neapolitan chord (i.e. the flattened supertonic) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven's Waldstein sonata, the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the early 19th-century piano's range. The choice of F minor becomes very clear when one realises that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F1 on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time. The total performance time of this movement is usually between and 11 minutes. Andante con moto A set of variations in D major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. (See image.) The four variations follow: The fourth variation ends with a deceptive cadence containing the dominant chord that resolves to a soft diminished seventh, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition (without pause) to the finale. The total performance time of this movement is about 6 to 8 minutes. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, the second part is directed to be repeated, and not the first. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a faster coda (at presto speed as seen above and in many editions) introducing a new theme which in turn leads into an extended final cadence in F minor. According to Donald Francis Tovey this is one of only a handful of Beethoven's works in sonata form that end in tragedy (the others being the C minor Piano Trio, Piano Sonata Op. 27 no. 2 (\\"Moonlight\\"), and the Violin Sonata Op. 30 no. 2.). The total performance time of this movement is about 7 to 8 minutes with the repeats and about to 6 minutes without them.

During the 1950s and 1960s, he reached the top of the pop charts with his interpretations of romantic ballads, including a cover of Eddy Arnold hit \\"You Don't Know Me\\" (1956) and \\"Have You Looked into Your Heart\\" (1964). Vale, who was of Italian descent, sang numerous songs in Italian, many of which were used in soundtracks by films of Martin Scorsese. Vale showed his love of Italian music with his albums, I Have But One Heart (1962) and Arrivederci, Roma (1963), full of Italian standards such as \\"Amore, Scusami\\", \\"Ciao, Ciao, Bambina\\", \\"Arrivederci, Roma\\", and \\"O Sole Mio\\". His renditions of \\"Volare\\", \\"Innamorata (Sweetheart)\\", and \\"Al di là\\" became classic Italian-American songs. Early life Gennaro Louis Vitaliano was born in the Bronx, New York, to Italian immigrant parents, and grew up in the Wakefield section of the Bronx which at the time was composed mainly of Italian-American families. In high school, to earn money, Vale took a job shining shoes in a barbershop, singing while he worked. His boss, Vito Veneziano, liked the sound so well that he paid for music lessons for the boy. Vale started singing in high school musicals and at a local nightclub. Still a teenager, he left school to work in a factory as an oiler alongside his father. Career His early nightclub performances led to additional shows in the early 1950s, including one lasting for three years at the Enchanted Room, a club in Yonkers, New York. When Paul Insetta (road manager for singer Guy Mitchell and hit songwriter) heard him there, he signed him to a management contract and further coached him. Genaro changed his name to the Americanized Jerry Vale. Insetta arranged for Vale to record some demonstration records of songs he'd written, and he brought them to Columbia Records. Guy Mitchell introduced Vale to Mitch Miller, influential executive at Columbia Records. Vale signed a recording contract, with Insetta as his manager for many years to come. Jerry Vale appeared on the Ted Mack Amateur Hour in 1950 singing \\"It Isn't Fair\\". Vale's first recording with the Columbia label, with accompaniment by Percy Faith and his band, was \\"You Can Never Give Me Back My Heart\\", reached #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Vale's first U.S. hit. His version of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", recorded in late 1963, was a fixture at many sporting events for years, and the gold record Vale received was displayed at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Vale frequently sang the song at Yankee Stadium. Additionally, he owned the Daytona Beach Admirals. He sang the Late Night with David Letterman anthem \\"It's A Late Night World\\" on the program's eighth anniversary special in 1990. He made cameo appearances as himself in the 1990 film Goodfellas and the 1995 film Casino, both directed by Martin Scorsese. Vale reportedly suffered a stroke in 2002 and did not perform in his later years. Personal life In 1959, Vale married Rita Grapel, a burlesque dancer. His biography A Singer's Life, by Richard Grudens, was published in 2000 by Celebrity Profiles. Death Jerry Vale died of natural causes in his sleep on May 18, 2014, at his home in Palm Desert, California. Vale was 83 years old. He and his wife had two children, Robert Vale and Pamela Vale Branch. He is interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery, in Cathedral City, California. In popular culture Vale played himself in a 1990 episode of Growing Pains, Season 5, episode 24, \\"Weekend at Mike's\\". In the 2016 Disney animated film Zootopia, Nick Wilde finds a CD by \\"Jerry Vole\\". As an actor, Vale appeared as himself in the films Goodfellas and Casino as well as the television series The Sopranos, and Who's The Boss. Vale is portrayed by Steven Van Zandt in the 2019 film The Irishman. Honors In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to Vale.

The third ship to bear this name, it was laid down on 3 February 1943 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard at Quincy, Massachusetts; launched on 22 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs Cornelius D. Scully, wife of the Mayor of Pittsburgh; and commissioned at Boston on 10 October 1944, with Capt. John Edward Gingrich in command. Service history World War II, 1944-1945 Pittsburgh trained along the east coast and in the Caribbean until departing Boston on 13 January 1945 for duty in the Pacific. After calling in Panama and final gunnery exercises in the Hawaiians, she joined TF 58 at Ulithi on 13 February, assigned to TG 58.2 formed around the aircraft carrier . Iwo Jima The force sortied on 10 February to prepare the way for the assault on Iwo Jima. Carrier air strikes against airfields near Tokyo on 16 and 17 February limited Japanese air response to the initial landings on 19 February. That day planes from Pittsburghs group began direct support to Marines fighting to overcome fierce Japanese resistance on the island. Final strikes against Tokyo's environs on 25 February and 1 March against the Nansei Shoto completed this operation. The force sailed from Ulithi on 14 March to pound airfields and other military installations on Kyūshū on 18 March, and again the next day. The Japanese struck back at dawn on the 19th, with an air raid which set the carrier ablaze, her decks utter chaos and power lost. Pittsburgh dashed to the rescue at . After saving 34 men from the water, Pittsburgh, with the light cruiser , performed an outstanding feat of seamanship in getting a tow line on board the flaming carrier. Pittsburgh then began the agonizingly slow task of pulling the carrier to safety, as the flattop's crew struggled to restore power. Twice gunning off enemy air attacks attempting to finish Franklin, the cruiser continued her effort until noon, on 20 March when Franklin was able to cast off the tow and proceed, albeit slowly, under her own power. Capt. Gingrich had remained at the conn for 48 hours during the situation. Okinawa Between 23 March and 27 April, Pittsburgh guarded the carriers as they first prepared for, then covered and supported, the invasion of Okinawa. Enemy airfields were interdicted, and the troops given direct aid from the carriers. Pittsburgh repelled enemy air attacks and launched her scout planes to rescue downed carrier pilots. After replenishing at Ulithi, the force sortied once more on 8 May to attack the Nansei Shoto and Southern Japan in the continuing fight for Okinawa. Damaged by a typhoon USS Pittsburgh after the typhoon, with her bow section missing. On 4 June, Pittsburgh began to fight a typhoon which by early next day had increased to winds and waves. Shortly after her starboard scout plane had been lifted off its catapult and dashed onto the deck by the wind, Pittsburghs second deck buckled, her bow structure thrust upward, and then the front fell off. However, not a man was lost. Still fighting the storm, and maneuvering to avoid being rammed by the drifting bow- structure, Pittsburgh was held quarter-on to the seas by engine manipulations while the forward bulkhead was shored. After a seven-hour battle, the storm subsided, and Pittsburgh proceeded at to Guam, arriving on 10 June. Her bow, nicknamed \\"McKeesport\\" (a suburb of Pittsburgh), was later salvaged by the tugboat and brought into Guam. The 104-foot section of bow broke off owing to poor plate welds at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co. at the Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts, in April 1943. With a false bow, Pittsburgh left Guam on 24 June bound for Puget Sound Navy Yard, arriving 16 July. Still under repair at war's end, she was placed in commission in reserve on 12 March 1946 and decommissioned on 7 March 1947. The typhoon damage also earned her the nickname \\"Longest Ship in the World\\" as thousands of miles separated the bow and stern. Atlantic and Mediterranean, 1951-1954 USS Pittsburgh anchored in Souda Bay, Crete, 8 May 1952. As the Korean War called for a major restoration of US naval strength, Pittsburgh recommissioned on 25 September 1951, Capt. Preston V. Mercer in command. She sailed on 20 October for the Panama Canal, trained out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and prepared at Norfolk for a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet for which she sailed on 11 February 1952. Returning on 20 May, she joined in the Atlantic Fleet's schedule of exercises and special operations in the western Atlantic and Caribbean. At this time her captain was P D Gallery. During her second Mediterranean cruise, for which she sailed on 1 December, she flew the flag of Vice Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander in Chief, Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean for a good-will cruise to the Indian Ocean in January 1953. She returned to Norfolk in May for a major modernization overhaul, but rejoined the 6th Fleet at Gibraltar on 19 January 1954. Once again she carried Admiral Wright to ports of the Indian Ocean during this cruise which ended with her return to Norfolk on 26 May. During the summer of 1954, she engaged in further operations along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. On 29 July 1954, Pittsburgh collided with another ship while sailing in the Saint Lawrence River. Damage to the hull was above the waterline and the holes were quickly repaired. Pacific, 1954-1956 On 21 October 1954, she passed through the Panama Canal to join the Pacific Fleet, with Long Beach her home port. She sailed almost at once for the Far East, calling at Pearl Harbor on 13 November and reaching Yokosuka on 26 November. She joined the 7th Fleet in exercises and to cover the Chinese Nationalist defense of the Tachen Islands and their evacuation of civilians and non-essential military personnel. Leaving Japan on 16 February 1955, she resumed west coast operations until reporting at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 28 October for inactivation. Decommissioning and sale, 1956-1974 Pittsburgh went into reserve on 28 April 1956, and was decommissioned at Bremerton on 28 August 1956. The ship remained there until stricken on 1 July 1973 and sold for scrap on 1 August 1974, to Zidell Explorations Corp., Portland, Oregon.

Known for playing distinctive supporting and character roles, Hoffman acted in many films from the early 1990s until his death in 2014. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest actors of his generation. Born and raised in Fairport, New York, Hoffman was drawn to theater in his youth after attending a stage production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons at age 12. Hoffman studied acting at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, and began his screen career in a 1991 episode of Law & Order and started to appear in films in 1992. He gained recognition for his supporting work, notably in Scent of a Woman (1992), Twister (1996), Boogie Nights (1997), Happiness (1998), Patch Adams (1998), The Big Lebowski (1998), Magnolia (1999), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Almost Famous (2000), Punch- Drunk Love (2002) and Along Came Polly (2004). He began to occasionally play leading roles, and for his portrayal of the author Truman Capote in Capote (2005), won multiple accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Actor. Hoffman's profile continued to grow and he received three more Oscar nominations for his supporting work as a brutally frank CIA officer in Charlie Wilson's War (2007), a priest accused of pedophilia in Doubt (2008), and the charismatic leader of a Scientology-type movement in The Master (2012). While he mainly worked in independent films, including The Savages (2007) and Synecdoche, New York (2008), Hoffman also appeared in Flawless (1999), and Hollywood blockbusters such as Twister (1996), Mission: Impossible III (2006), and in one of his final roles, as Plutarch Heavensbee in the Hunger Games series (2013–15). The feature Jack Goes Boating (2010) marked his debut as a filmmaker. Hoffman was also an accomplished theater actor and director. He joined the off-Broadway LAByrinth Theater Company in 1995, where he directed, produced, and appeared in numerous stage productions. His performances in three Broadway plays—True West in 2000, Long Day's Journey into Night in 2003, and Death of a Salesman in 2012—all led to Tony Award nominations. Hoffman struggled with drug addiction as a young adult and relapsed in 2013 after many years of abstinence. In February 2014, he died of combined drug intoxication. Remembered for his fearlessness in playing reprehensible characters, and for bringing depth and humanity to such roles, Hoffman was described in his New York Times obituary as \\"perhaps the most ambitious and widely admired American actor of his generation\\". Early life Hoffman was born on July 23, 1967, in the Rochester suburb of Fairport, New York. His mother, Marilyn O'Connor (née Loucks), came from nearby Waterloo and worked as an elementary school teacher before becoming a lawyer and eventually a family court judge. His father, Gordon Stowell Hoffman, who was of German descent, was a native of Geneva, New York, and worked for the Xerox Corporation. Along with one brother, Gordy, Hoffman had two sisters, Jill and Emily. The village of Fairport, New York, Hoffman's hometown Hoffman was baptized a Roman Catholic and attended Mass as a child, but did not have a heavily religious upbringing. His parents divorced when he was nine, and the children were raised primarily by their mother. Hoffman's childhood passion was sports, particularly wrestling and baseball, but at age 12, he saw a stage production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons and was transfixed. He recalled in 2008, \\"I was changed – permanently changed – by that experience. It was like a miracle to me\\". Hoffman developed a love for the theater, and proceeded to attend regularly with his mother, who was a lifelong enthusiast. He remembered that productions of Quilters and Alms for the Middle Class, the latter starring a teenaged Robert Downey, Jr., were also particularly inspirational. At the age of 14, Hoffman suffered a neck injury that ended his sporting activity, and he began to consider acting. Encouraged by his mother, he joined a drama club, and initially committed to it because he was attracted to a female member. Acting gradually became a passion for Hoffman: \\"I loved the camaraderie of it, the people, and that's when I decided it was what I wanted to do.\\" At the age of 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs, where he met his future collaborators Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Miller later commented on Hoffman's popularity at the time: \\"We were attracted to the fact that he was genuinely serious about what he was doing. Even then, he was passionate.\\" Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. Between starting on the program and graduating from Fairport High School, he continued his training at the Circle in the Square Theatre's summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an usher. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989. Career Early career (1991–95) After graduating, Hoffman worked in off-Broadway theater and made additional money with customer service jobs. He made his screen debut in 1991, in a Law & Order episode called \\"The Violence of Summer\\", playing a man accused of rape. His first cinema role came the following year, when he was credited as \\"Phil Hoffman\\" in the independent film Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole. After this, he adopted his grandfather's name, Seymour, to avoid confusion with another actor. More film roles promptly followed, with appearances in the studio production My New Gun, and a small role in the comedy Leap of Faith, starring Steve Martin. Following these roles, he gained attention playing a spoiled student in the Oscar-winning Al Pacino film Scent of a Woman (1992). Hoffman auditioned five times for his role, which The Guardian journalist Ryan Gilbey says gave him an early opportunity \\"to indulge his skill for making unctuousness compelling\\". The film earned US$134 million worldwide and was the first to get Hoffman noticed. Reflecting on Scent of a Woman, Hoffman later said \\"If I hadn't gotten into that film, I wouldn't be where I am today.\\" At this time, he abandoned his job in a delicatessen to become a professional actor. Hoffman continued playing small roles throughout the early 1990s. After appearing in Joey Breaker and the critically panned teen zombie picture My Boyfriend's Back, he had a more notable role playing John Cusack's wealthy friend in the crime comedy Money for Nothing. In 1994, he portrayed an inexperienced mobster in the crime thriller The Getaway, starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, and he subsequently appeared with Andy García and Meg Ryan in the romantic drama When a Man Loves a Woman. He then played an uptight police deputy who gets punched by Paul Newman – one of Hoffman's acting idols – in the drama Nobody's Fool. Still considering stage work to be fundamental to his career, Hoffman joined the LAByrinth Theater Company of New York City in 1995. This association lasted the remainder of his life; along with appearing in multiple productions, he later became co-artistic director of the theater company with John Ortiz, and directed various plays over the years. Hoffman's only film appearance of 1995 was in the 22-minute short comedy The Fifteen Minute Hamlet, which satirized the film industry in an Elizabethan setting. He played the characters of Bernardo, Horatio, and Laertes alongside Austin Pendleton's Hamlet. A rising actor (1996–99) Between April and May 1996, Hoffman appeared at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in a Mark Wing- Davey production of Caryl Churchill's The Skriker. Following this, based on his work in Scent of a Woman, he was cast by writer–director Paul Thomas Anderson to appear in his debut feature Hard Eight (1996). Hoffman had only a brief role in the crime thriller, playing a cocksure young craps player, but it began the most important collaboration of his career. Before cementing his creative partnership with Anderson, Hoffman appeared in one of the year's biggest blockbusters, Twister, playing a grubby, hyperactive storm chaser alongside Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. According to a People survey of Twitter and Facebook users, Twister is the film with which Hoffman is most popularly associated. He then reunited with Anderson for the director's second feature, Boogie Nights, about the Golden Age of Pornography. The ensemble piece starred Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds; Hoffman played a boom operator, described by David Fear of Rolling Stone as a \\"complete, unabashed loser,\\" who attempts to seduce Wahlberg's character. Warmly received by critics, the film grew into a cult classic, and has been cited as the role in which Hoffman first showed his full ability. Fear commended the \\"naked emotional neediness\\" of the performance, adding that it made for compulsive viewing. Hoffman later expressed his appreciation for Anderson when he called the director \\"incomparable\\". Continuing with this momentum, Hoffman appeared in five films in 1998. He had supporting roles in the crime thriller Montana and the romantic comedy Next Stop Wonderland, both of which were commercial failures, before working with the Coen brothers in their dark comedy The Big Lebowski. Hoffman had long been a fan of the directors, and relished the experience of working with them. Appearing alongside Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, Hoffman played Brandt, the smug personal assistant of the titular character. Although it was only a small role, he claimed it was one for which he was most recognized, in a film that has achieved cult status and a large fan base. Between March and April 1998, Hoffman made 30 appearances on stage at the New York Theatre Workshop in a production of Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking, portraying an ex-heroin addict. Hoffman took an unflattering role in Todd Solondz's Happiness (1998), a misanthropic comedy about the lives of three sisters and those around them. He played Allen, a strange loner who makes crude phone calls to women; the character furiously masturbates during one conversation, producing what film scholar Jerry Mosher calls an \\"embarrassingly raw performance\\". Jake Coyle of the Associated Press rated Allen as one of the creepiest characters in American cinema, but critic Xan Brooks highlighted the pathos that Hoffman brought to the role. Happiness was controversial but widely praised, and Hoffman's role has been cited by critics as one of his best. His final 1998 release was more mainstream, as he appeared as a medical graduate in the Robin Williams comedy Patch Adams. The film was critically panned, but one of the highest-grossing of Hoffman's career. In 1999, Hoffman starred opposite Robert De Niro as drag queen Rusty Zimmerman in Joel Schumacher's drama Flawless. Hoffman considered De Niro the most imposing actor with whom he had appeared, and he felt that working with the veteran performer profoundly improved his own acting. Hoffman's ability to avoid clichés in playing such a delicate role was noted by critics, and Roger Ebert said it confirmed him as \\"one of the best new character actors\\". He was rewarded with his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. Hoffman then reunited with Paul Thomas Anderson, where he was given an atypically virtuous role in the ensemble drama Magnolia. The film, set over one day in Los Angeles, features Hoffman as a nurse who cares for Jason Robards' character. The performance was approved of by the medical industry, and Jessica Winter of the Village Voice considered it Hoffman's most indelible work, likening him to a guardian angel in his caring for the dying father. Magnolia has been included in lists of the greatest films of all time, and it was a personal favorite of Hoffman's. One of the most critically and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), which he considered \\"as edgy as you can get for a Hollywood movie\\". He played a \\"preppy bully\\" who taunts Matt Damon's Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called \\"the truest upper class twit in all of American movies\\". Hoffman's performance caught the attention of Meryl Streep – another of his cinematic idols – with his performance: \\"I sat up straight in my seat and said, 'Who is that?' I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done what we all strive for – he's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating.\\" In recognition of his work in Magnolia and The Talented Mr. Ripley, Hoffman was named the year's Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review. Theatrical success and leading roles (2000–04) Cannes in 2002 promoting Punch-Drunk Love Following a string of roles in successful films in the late 1990s, Hoffman had established a reputation as a top supporting player who could be relied on to make an impression with each performance. His film appearances were likened by David Kamp of GQ to \\"discovering a prize in a box of cereal, receiving a bonus, or bumping unexpectedly into an old friend\\". According to Jerry Mosher, as the year 2000 began, \\"it seemed Hoffman was everywhere, poised on the cusp of stardom\\". Hoffman had begun to be recognized as a theater actor in 1999, when he received a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Featured Actor for the off-Broadway play The Author's Voice. This success continued with the 2000 Broadway revival of Sam Shepard's True West, where Hoffman alternated roles nightly with co-star John C. Reilly, making 154 appearances between March and July 2000. Ben Brantley of The New York Times felt that it was the best stage performance of Hoffman's career, calling him \\"brilliant\\", and the actor earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Play. The following year, Hoffman appeared with Meryl Streep, Natalie Portman, and John Goodman in a Delacorte Theater production of Chekhov's The Seagull – although Brantley felt that this performance was less fully realized. As a stage director, Hoffman received two Drama Desk Award nominations for Outstanding Director of a Play: one for Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train in 2001, and another for Our Lady of 121st Street in 2003. In a 2008 interview, Hoffman opined that \\"switching hats\\" between acting and directing helped him improve in both roles. David Mamet's comedy State and Main, about the difficulties of shooting a film in rural New England, was Hoffman's first film role of 2000 and had a limited release. He had a more prominent supporting role that year in Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe's popular coming-of-age film set in the 1970s music industry. Hoffman portrayed the enthusiastic rock critic Lester Bangs, a task by which he felt burdened, but he managed to convey the real figure's mannerisms and sharp wit after watching him in a BBC interview. The following year, Hoffman featured as the narrator and interviewer in The Party's Over, a documentary about the 2000 U.S. elections. He assumed the position of a \\"politically informed and alienated Generation-Xer\\" who seeks to be educated in U.S. politics, but ultimately reveals the extent of public dissatisfaction in this area. In 2002, Hoffman was given his first leading role (despite joking at the time \\"Even if I was hired into a leading-man part, I'd probably turn it into the non- leading-man part\\") in Todd Louiso's tragicomedy Love Liza (2002). His brother Gordy wrote the script, which Hoffman had seen at their mother's house five years earlier, about a widower who starts sniffing gasoline to cope with his wife's suicide. He considered it the finest piece of writing he had ever read, \\"incredibly humble in its exploration of grief\\", but critics were less enthusiastic about the production. A review for the BBC wrote that Hoffman had finally been given a part that showed \\"what he's truly capable of\\", but few witnessed this as the film had a limited release and earned only US$210,000. Director Paul Thomas Anderson, who cast Hoffman in five of his first six films Later in 2002, Hoffman starred opposite Adam Sandler and Emily Watson in Anderson's critically acclaimed fourth picture, the surrealist romantic comedy-drama Punch-Drunk Love (2002), where he played an illegal phone-sex \\"supervisor\\". Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader saw the performance as a fine example of Hoffman's \\"knack for turning small roles into seminal performances\\" and praised the actor's comedic ability. In a very different film, Hoffman was next seen with Anthony Hopkins in the high-budget thriller Red Dragon, a prequel to The Silence of the Lambs, portraying the meddlesome tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds. His fourth appearance of 2002 came in Spike Lee's drama 25th Hour, playing an English teacher who makes a devastating drunken mistake. Both Lee and the film's lead Edward Norton were thrilled to work with Hoffman, and Lee confessed that he had long wanted to do a picture with the actor, but had waited until he found the right role. Hoffman considered his character, Jakob, to be one of the most reticent characters he had ever played, a straight-laced \\"corduroy-pants-wearing kind of guy.\\" Roger Ebert promoted 25th Hour to one of his \\"Great Movies\\" in 2009, and along with A. O. Scott, considered it to be one of the best films of the 2000s. The drama Owning Mahowny (2003) gave Hoffman his second lead role, starring opposite Minnie Driver as a bank employee who embezzles money to feed his gambling addiction. Based on the true story of Toronto banker Brian Molony, who committed the largest fraud in Canadian history, Hoffman met with Molony to prepare for the role and help him play the character as accurately as possible. He was determined not to conform to \\"movie character\\" stereotypes, and his portrayal of addiction won approval from the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Roger Ebert assessed Hoffman's performance as \\"a masterpiece of discipline and precision,\\" but the film earned little at the box office. Hoffman's second 2003 appearance was a small role in Anthony Minghella's successful Civil War epic Cold Mountain. He played an immoral preacher, a complex character that Hoffman described as a \\"mass of contradictions\\". The same year, from April to August, he appeared with Vanessa Redgrave in a Broadway revival of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Director Robert Falls later commented on the dedication and experience that Hoffman brought to his role of alcoholic Jamie Tyrone: \\"Every night he ripped it up to an extent that he couldn't leave [the role]. Phil carried it with him.\\" Hoffman received his second Tony Award nomination, this time for Best Featured Actor in a Play. In 2004, he appeared as the crude, has-been actor friend of Ben Stiller's character in the box-office hit Along Came Polly. Reflecting on the role, People said it proved that \\"Hoffman could deliver comedic performances with the best of them\\". Critical acclaim (2005–09) Truman Capote in 1959: Hoffman won many awards for his portrayal of the writer in Capote (2005). A turning point in Hoffman's career came with the biographical film Capote (2005), which dramatized Truman Capote's experience of writing his true crime novel In Cold Blood (1966). Hoffman took the title role for a project that he co-produced and helped come to fruition. Portraying the idiosyncratic writer proved highly demanding, requiring significant weight loss and four months of research – such as watching video clips of Capote to help him affect the author's effeminate voice and mannerisms. Hoffman stated that he was not concerned with perfectly imitating Capote's speech, but he did feel a great duty to \\"express the vitality and the nuances\\" of the writer. During filming, he stayed in character constantly so as not to lose the voice and posture: \\"Otherwise,\\" he explained, \\"I would give my body a chance to bail on me.\\" Capote was released to great acclaim, particularly regarding Hoffman's performance. Many critics commented that the role was designed to win awards, and indeed Hoffman received an Oscar, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild Award, BAFTA, and various other critics' awards. In 2006, Premiere listed his role in Capote as the 35th-greatest movie performance of all time. After the film, several commentators began to describe Hoffman as one of the finest, most ambitious actors of his generation. Hoffman received his only Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his supporting role in the HBO miniseries Empire Falls (2005), about life in a New England town. He ultimately lost to castmate Paul Newman. In 2006, he appeared in the summer blockbuster Mission: Impossible III, playing the villainous arms dealer Owen Davian opposite Tom Cruise. A journalist for Vanity Fair stated that Hoffman's \\"black-hat performance was one of the most delicious in a Hollywood film since Alan Rickman's in Die Hard \\", and he was generally approved of for bringing gravitas to the action film. With a gross of nearly US$400 million, it exposed Hoffman to a mainstream audience. Returning to independent films in 2007, Hoffman began with a starring role in Tamara Jenkins's The Savages, where Laura Linney and he played siblings responsible for putting their dementia-ridden father (Philip Bosco) in a care home. Jake Coyle of the Associated Press stated that it was \\"the epitome of a Hoffman film: a mix of comedy and tragedy told with subtlety, bone-dry humor, and flashes of grace\\". Hoffman received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in The Savages. He next appeared in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, the final film by veteran director Sidney Lumet, where he played a realtor who embezzles funds from his employer to support his drug habit. Mosher comments that the character was one of the most unpleasant of Hoffman's career, but that his \\"fearlessness again revealed the humanity within a deeply flawed character\\" as he appeared naked in the opening sex scene. The film was received positively by critics as a powerful and affecting thriller. Mike Nichols's political film Charlie Wilson's War (2007) gave Hoffman his second Academy Award nomination, again for playing a real individual – Gust Avrakotos, the CIA agent who conspired with Congressman Charlie Wilson (played by Tom Hanks) to aid Afghani rebels in their fight against the Soviet Union. Todd McCarthy wrote of Hoffman's performance: \\"Decked out with a pouffy '80s hairdo, moustache, protruding gut and ever- present smokes ... whenever he's on, the picture vibrates with conspiratorial electricity.\\" The film was a critical and commercial success, and along with his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, Hoffman was nominated for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe Award. Hoffman at the 81st Academy Awards in February 2009, where he was nominated for Doubt The year 2008 contained two significant Hoffman roles. In Charlie Kaufman's enigmatic drama Synecdoche, New York, he starred as Caden Cotard, a frustrated dramatist who attempts to build a scale replica of New York inside a warehouse for a play. Hoffman again showed his willingness to reveal unattractive traits, as the character ages and deteriorates, and committed to a deeply psychological role. Critics were divided in their response to the \\"ambitious and baffling\\" film. Sonny Bunch of The Washington Times found it \\"impressionistic, inaccessible, and endlessly frustrating\\", likening Hoffman's character to \\"God, if God lacked imagination\\". Roger Ebert, on the contrary, named it the best film of the decade and considered it one of the greatest of all time, and Robbie Collin, film critic for The Daily Telegraph, believes Hoffman gave one of cinema's best performances. Hoffman's second role of the year came opposite Meryl Streep and Amy Adams in John Patrick Shanley's Doubt, where he played Father Brendan Flynn – a priest accused of sexually abusing a 12-year-old African American student in the 1960s. Hoffman was already familiar with the play and appreciated the opportunity to bring it to the screen; in preparing for the role, he talked extensively to a priest who lived through the era. The film had a mixed reception, with some critics such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian suspicious of it as Oscar bait, but Hoffman gained second consecutive Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, and was also nominated by the Screen Actors Guild. On stage in 2009, Hoffman played Iago in Peter Sellars' futuristic production of Othello (with the title role by John Ortiz), which received mixed reviews. Ben Brantley, theatre critic of The New York Times, found it to be \\"exasperatingly misconceived\\", remarking that even when Hoffman is attempting to \\"manipulate others into self-destruction, he comes close to spoiling everything by erupting into genuine, volcanic fury\\". Hoffman also did his first vocal performance for the claymation film Mary and Max, although the film did not initially have an American release. He played Max, a depressed New Yorker with Asperger syndrome, while Toni Collette voiced Mary – the Australian girl who becomes his pen pal. Continuing with animation, Hoffman then worked on an episode of the children's show Arthur and received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Performer In An Animated Program. Later in the year, he played a brash American disc jockey opposite Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans in Richard Curtis's British comedy The Boat That Rocked (also known as Pirate Radio) – a character based on Emperor Rosko, a host of Radio Caroline in 1966. He also had a cameo role as a bartender in Ricky Gervais's The Invention of Lying. Reflecting on Hoffman's work in the late 2000s, Mosher writes that the actor remained impressive, but had not delivered a testing performance on the level of his work in Capote. The film critic David Thomson believed that Hoffman showed indecisiveness at this time, unsure whether to play spectacular supporting roles or become a lead actor who is capable of controlling the emotional dynamic and outcome of a film. Final years (2010–14) Hoffman's profile continued to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure. Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The independent drama Jack Goes Boating was adapted from Robert Glaudini's play of the same name, in which Hoffman had starred and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended only to direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack – a lonely limousine driver looking for love – after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable. The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, though it received many positive reviews. However, Dave Edwards of the Daily Mirror remarked that \\"Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely remember what it was about as I left\\", while critic Mark Kermode appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director. In addition to Jack Goes Boating, in 2010 Hoffman also directed Brett C. Leonard's tragic drama The Long Red Road for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Steven Oxman of Variety described the production as \\"heavy handed\\" and \\"predictable\\", but \\"intriguing and at least partially successful\\". Moneyball premiere in September 2011 Hoffman next had significant supporting roles in two films, both released in the last third of 2011. In Moneyball, a sports drama about the 2002 season of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, he played the manager Art Howe. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Hoffman was described as \\"perfectly cast\\" by Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post, but the real-life Art Howe accused the filmmakers of giving an \\"unfair and untrue\\" portrayal of him. Hoffman's second film of the year was George Clooney's political drama The Ides of March, in which he played the earnest campaign manager to the Democratic presidential candidate Mike Morris (Clooney). The film was well- received and Hoffman's performance, especially in the scenes opposite Paul Giamatti – who played the rival campaign manager – was positively noted. Hoffman's work on the film earned him his fourth BAFTA Award nomination. In the spring of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, starring as Willy Loman in a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman. Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre's history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was too young for the role of 62-year- old Loman, and Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted that he found the role difficult, but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination. Hoffman collaborated with Paul Thomas Anderson for the fifth time in The Master (2012), where he turned in what critic Peter Bradshaw considered the most memorable performance of his career. Set in 1950s America, the film featured Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd, the charismatic leader of a nascent Scientology- type movement who brings a troubled man (Joaquin Phoenix) under his tutelage. Hoffman was instrumental in the project's development, having been involved with it for three years. He assisted Anderson in the writing of the script by reviewing samples of it, and suggested making Phoenix's character, Freddie Quell, the protagonist instead of Dodd. A talented dancer, Hoffman was able to showcase his abilities by performing a jig during a surreal sequence; Bradshaw called it an \\"extraordinary moment\\" that \\"only Hoffman could have carried off.\\" The Master was praised as an intelligent and challenging drama, and Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader also felt that it contained Hoffman's finest work: \\"He's inscrutable yet welcoming, intimidating yet charismatic, villainous yet fatherly. He epitomizes so many things at once that it's impossible to think of [Dodd] as mere movie character\\". Hoffman and Phoenix received a joint Volpi Cup Award at the Venice Film Festival for their performances, and Hoffman was also nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA Award and a SAG Award for the supporting role. Hoffman, Anton Corbijn and Grigoriy Dobrygin promoting A Most Wanted Man at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2014, less than two weeks before his death A Late Quartet was Hoffman's other film release of 2012, where he played a violinist in a string quartet whose members (played by Christopher Walken, Catherine Keener, and Mark Ivanir) face a crisis when one is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The drama received favorable reviews, and Stephen Holden of The New York Times called Hoffman's performance \\"exceptional\\". In 2013, Hoffman joined the popular Hunger Games series in its second film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, where he played gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. The film finished as the 10th-highest grossing in history to that point, and Hoffman became recognizable to a new generation of film-goers. In January 2014, shortly before his death, he attended the Sundance Film Festival to promote two films. In Anton Corbijn's A Most Wanted Man, a thriller based on John le Carré's novel, Hoffman played a German intelligence officer. His performance was praised by Xan Brooks as one of \\"terrific, lip-smacking relish: full of mischief, anchored by integrity.\\" The other was God's Pocket, the directorial debut of actor John Slattery, in which Hoffman played a thief. In November 2014, nine months after his death, Hoffman was seen in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1. At the time of his death, Hoffman was filming The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2, the final film in the series, and had already completed the majority of his scenes. His two remaining scenes were rewritten to compensate for his absence, and the film was released in November 2015. Hoffman was also preparing for his second directorial effort, a Prohibition-era drama titled Ezekiel Moss, which was to star Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal. In addition, he had filmed a pilot episode for the Showtime series Happyish, in which he played the lead role of an advertising executive, but plans for a full season were put on hold following his death. The role was later passed on to Steve Coogan. Personal life Hoffman at a Hudson Union Society event in September 2010 Hoffman rarely mentioned his personal life in interviews, stating in 2012 that he would \\"rather not because my family doesn't have any choice. If I talk about them in the press, I'm giving them no choice. So I choose not to.\\" For 14 years, he was in a relationship with costume designer Mimi O'Donnell, whom he had met in 1999 when they were both working on the Hoffman-directed play In Arabia We'd All Be Kings. They lived in New York City and had a son and two daughters. While some reports stated Hoffman and O'Donnell separated in the fall of 2013, O'Donnell later said she and Hoffman were both committed to their relationship, but he had moved out of their longtime residence to a nearby apartment to protect their children from the effects of his relapse into substance abuse. Hoffman was also discreet about his religious and political beliefs, but it is known that he voted for the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. He felt that keeping his personal life private was beneficial to his career: \\"The less you know about me the more interesting it will be to watch me do what I do\\". In a 2006 interview with 60 Minutes, Hoffman revealed he had engaged in drug and alcohol abuse during his time at New York University, saying he had used \\"anything I could get my hands on. I liked it all.\\" Following his graduation in 1989, he entered a drug rehabilitation program at age 22, and remained sober for 23 years. However, he relapsed in 2013, and admitted himself to drug rehabilitation for about ten days in May of that year. Death and legacy Although friends stated that Hoffman's drug use was under control at the time, on February 2, 2014, Hoffman was found dead in the bathroom of his Manhattan apartment by a friend, playwright and screenwriter David Bar Katz. Hoffman was 46. Detectives searching the apartment found heroin and prescription medications at the scene, and revealed that he was discovered with a syringe in his arm. After an investigation including the Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Alex Spiro, Hoffman's death was officially ruled an accident caused by \\"acute mixed drug intoxication, including heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and amphetamine\\". Whether Hoffman had taken all of the substances on the same day, or whether any of the substances had remained in his system from earlier use, was not reported. A funeral Mass was held at St. Ignatius Loyola Church in Manhattan on February 7, 2014 and was attended by many of his former co-stars. Those who attended the funeral service included Marisa Tomei, Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett, Julianne Moore, Ethan Hawke, Joaquin Phoenix, Laura Linney, Amy Adams, Michelle Williams, Chris Rock, Ellen Burstyn, Jerry Stiller, Louis C.K., Mike Nichols, and Diane Sawyer. Hoffman was cremated. Hoffman's death was lamented by fans and the film industry and was described by several commentators as a considerable loss to the profession. On February 5, 2014, the LAByrinth Theatre Company honored his memory by holding a candlelight vigil, and Broadway dimmed its lights for one minute. In another tribute, actress Cate Blanchett dedicated her BAFTA trophy to Hoffman when she received the award for Blue Jasmine on February 16. Three weeks after Hoffman's death, Katz established the American Playwriting Foundation in the actor's memory. With the money received from a libel lawsuit against the National Enquirer (which inaccurately published that Hoffman and Katz were lovers), the foundation awards an annual prize of US$45,000 to the author of an unproduced play. Katz named this the \\"Relentless Prize\\" in honor of Hoffman's dedication to the profession. Hoffman left his fortune, around US$35 million, to Mimi O'Donnell in his October 2004 will, trusting her to distribute money to their children. At the 90th Academy Awards, Sam Rockwell dedicated his win for Best Supporting Actor to him, stating at the end of his acceptance speech \\"This is for my buddy, Phil Hoffman.\\" Katz remembered him by a prose poem written in The Guardian on December 21, 2014. Reception and acting style Hoffman was held in high regard within both the film and theater industries, and he was often cited in the media as one of the finest actors of his generation. Despite this status among his peers and critics, he was never one of the most popular film stars, and has been overlooked in lists of all-time greatest actors. He was not a typical movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was grateful for his appearance as it made him believable in a wide range of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, \\"The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life\\". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an \\"anti-star\\", whose real identity remained \\"amorphous and unmoored\\". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, \\"I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK. I think there are other people who are interested in what I do.\\" Most of Hoffman's notable roles came in independent films, including particularly original ones, but he also featured in several Hollywood blockbusters. He generally played supporting roles, appearing in both dramas and comedies, but was noted for his ability to make small parts memorable. Peter Bradshaw, film critic for The Guardian, felt that \\"Almost every single one of his credits had something special about it\\". Hoffman was praised for his versatility and ability to fully inhabit any role, but specialized in playing creeps and misfits: \\"his CV was populated almost exclusively by snivelling wretches, insufferable prigs, braggarts and outright bullies\\" writes the journalist Ryan Gilbey. Hoffman was appreciated for making these roles real, complex and even sympathetic; while Todd Louiso, director of Love Liza, believed that Hoffman connected to people on screen because he looked like an ordinary man and revealed his vulnerability. Xan Brooks of The Guardian remarked that the actor's particular talent was to \\"take thwarted, twisted humanity and ennoble it\\". \\"The more pathetic or deluded the character,\\" writes Gilbey, \\"the greater Hoffman's relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of the merely monstrous.\\" When asked in 2006 why he undertook such roles, Hoffman responded, \\"I didn't go out looking for negative characters; I went out looking for people who have a struggle and a fight to tackle. That's what interests me.\\" Work ethic The journalist Jeff Simon described Hoffman as \\"probably the most in-demand character actor of his generation\\", but Hoffman claimed never to take it for granted that he would be offered roles. Although he worked hard and regularly, he was humble about his acting success, and when asked by a friend if he was having any luck he quietly replied, \\"I'm in a film, Cold Mountain, that has just come out.\\" Patrick Fugit, who worked with Hoffman on Almost Famous, recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in \\"a school-of-hard- knocks way\\", remarking that \\"there was a certain weight that came with him\\". Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, \\"ultimately my main goal is to do good work. If it doesn't pay well, so be it.\\" He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year. Hoffman occasionally changed his hair and lost or gained weight for parts, and he went to great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview, he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: \\"The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult.\\" In an earlier interview with The New York Times, he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, \\"that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's a beautiful thing ... Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great – well, that's absolutely torturous.\\" This struggle was confirmed by the author John le Carré, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel A Most Wanted Man. While praising the actor's intelligence and intuition, le Carré acknowledged the burden that Hoffman felt: \\"It was painful and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing. The world was too bright for him to handle.\\" Filmography and awards Hoffman appeared in 55 films and one miniseries during his screen career spanning 22 years. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for Capote (2005), and was nominated three times for Best Supporting Actor for Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Doubt (2008), and The Master (2012). He also received five Golden Globe Award nominations (winning one), five BAFTA Award nominations (winning one), four Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning one), and won the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival. Hoffman remained active in theater throughout his career, starring in ten and directing 19 stage productions (predominantly in New York). He received three Tony Award nominations for his Broadway performances: two for Best Leading Actor, in True West (2000) and Death of a Salesman (2012), and one for Best Featured Actor in Long Day's Journey into Night (2003).

Portsmouth was laid down by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, on 28 June 1943; launched on 20 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Marian M. Dale and Mrs. Sarah B. Leigh, and commissioned 25 June 1945, Captain Heber B. Brumbaugh in command. Service history Following shakedown off Cuba, Portsmouth, based at Norfolk, was employed with the Operational Development Force until the spring of 1946. In May she departed on a goodwill cruise to Africa and after visiting Cape Town, Lagos, Freetown, Monrovia, Dakar, and Casablanca, steamed into the Mediterranean for calls at Naples, and Palermo before heading home. On 25 November, Portsmouth got underway to return to the Mediterranean. Arriving at Naples on 7 December, she shifted around the peninsula to Trieste at the end of the month, and until February 1947 cruised in the politically turbulent Adriatic. The following month, she returned for another two weeks at Trieste and in April she sailed for the United States. The following November, she again steamed east to the Mediterranean, returning to the east coast for overhaul at Boston on 11 March 1948. On completion of overhaul, she resumed type exercises off the eastern seaboard and conducted Naval Reserve training cruises to the Caribbean. On 9 March 1949, she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for inactivation overhaul. Decommissioned on 15 June 1949, she joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and into 1970 remained a unit of that fleet, berthed at Philadelphia. Two of her main engines remain in service today as part of the MARF (Modifications and Additions to a Reactor Facility) facility for the S7G nuclear reactor prototype in Ballston Spa, New York.

The earliest example of such paper was made in Germany in 1479. Unsubstantiated anecdotes suggest that this watermark was introduced to England in 1580 by John Spilman, a German who established a papermill at Dartford, Kent. Apocryphally, the Rump Parliament substituted a fool's cap for the royal arms as a watermark on the paper used for the journals of Parliament. Oficio In Venezuela and Chile the paper size is named oficio. In Venezuela While laws expressly permit any paper size, public offices require all documents to be presented in oficio paper size. In Brazil, the same size is usually named folio, but is also sometimes called ofício II. This is a reference to the paper size, which is known as ofício in Portuguese, despite being called legal in English . F4 F4 is a paper size .Prographic paper sizes Although metric, based on the A4 paper size, and named to suggest that it is part of the official ISO 216 paper sizes, it is only a de facto standard.

Early years Charles Curran was born in Dublin. His father, Felix Curran, was an army schoolmaster and his mother, Alicia Isabella Bruce, came from Aberdeen. Three weeks after his birth, the family moved to Aberdeen, then his family moved to Yorkshire in 1924. He was the eldest child in a family of four siblings. He attended Wath Grammar School, before obtaining a first-class honours degree at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Career He served in the Indian Army from 1942 to 1945, but left to work in the BBC Talks department. He resigned following a dispute to edit the Canadian Fishing News, but he returned in 1951 to join BBC Monitoring. Subsequent posts included Secretary and Director of External Broadcasting. While Director-General, he served three terms as President of the European Broadcasting Union. He succeeded Ronnie Waldman as Managing Director of the news agency Visnews in 1977. He was Director-General of the BBC from 1 April 1969 to 30 September 1977. He was the first grammar school-educated director-general. Following the appointment of the former Conservative minister Lord Hill as Chairman of the BBC Governors in 1967 (ironically, the Labour Prime Minister who appointed Hill, Harold Wilson, had attacked Hill's appointment as chairman of the Independent Television Authority under a Conservative government in 1963), Curran's arrival marked a return to a more cautious approach after the radicalism of Sir Hugh Carleton Greene. Curran also suffered criticism from Harold Wilson, at that time the Leader of the Opposition, who claimed that the documentary Yesterday's Men (1971) was biased against himself and the Labour Party,David Wilby Yesterday's Men 1971\\", BBC 2006 an assertion the BBC now accepts.Yesterday's Men (1971), History of the BBC A parallel documentary at the time on the Heath government passed without incident. Unlike Greene, Curran allowed himself to be influenced by Mary Whitehouse. Curran issued an apology to Whitehouse after she complained about the violence at the end of part three of The Deadly Assassin (1976), a Doctor Who serial. Philip Hinchcliffe, then series producer, was replaced after only three more serials and his successor, Graham Williams, was ordered to lighten the tone and reduce the violence and horror content.David J. Howe, Mark Stammers, Stephen James Walker Doctor Who: The Seventies, Niagara, NY: London Bridge, 1994. p. 108 It was under Curran that the BBC produced some of its best-loved and most consistently repeated comedy series, such as Dad's Army, Porridge and the first series of Fawlty Towers. Curran has often been blamed for an unenthusiastic and somewhat censorious attitude towards Monty Python's Flying Circus, but the Python team still won many of their battles with BBC officialdom. The Play for Today series continued to take risks throughout Curran's eight years as Director-General. The Morecambe and Wise Show became one of the best-loved British TV institutions ever between 1969 and 1977, and the Curran era also saw the development of Michael Parkinson's hugely popular Saturday-night chat show. Knighthood and death Curran was made a Knight Bachelor in 1974.Supplement to the London Gazette of Friday, 28 December 1973, No. 46162, Tuesday, 1 January 1974, p. 1 Following a period of ill health, Sir Charles Curran died from a heart attack on 9 January 1980, aged 58. His funeral was held in Westminster Cathedral. He is not to be confused with a former Conservative Member of Parliament Leslie Charles Curran.

It was incorporated in 1847 from an amalgamation of several existing railways. It was the third-largest railway system based in northern England (after the Midland and North Eastern Railways). The intensity of its service was reflected in the 1,650 locomotives it owned – it was by far the most densely-trafficked system in the British Isles with more locomotives per mile than any other company – and that one third of its 738 signal boxes controlled junctions averaging one every . No two adjacent stations were more than apart and its 1,904 passenger services occupied 57 pages in Bradshaw, a number exceeded only by the Great Western Railway, the London and North Western Railway, and the Midland Railway. It was the first mainline railway to introduce electrification of some of its lines, and it also ran steamboat services across the Irish Sea and North Sea, being a bigger shipowner than any other British railway company. It amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922. One year later, the merged company became the largest constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. History The L&YR; was incorporated in 1847, being an amalgamation of several important lines, the chief of which was the Manchester and Leeds Railway (itself having been incorporated in 1836). Constituent companies The following companies, in order, were amalgamated into the L&YR.; The dates shown are, in most cases, the Acts of Parliament authorising the incorporation and amalgamation of each company.

For working purposes the railway was split into three divisions: * Western Division:  Manchester to Blackpool and Fleetwood;  Manchester to Bolton, Wigan, Southport and Liverpool; and the direct line to Liverpool; * East Lancashire or Central Division  Manchester to Oldham, Bury, Rochdale, Todmorden, Accrington, Burnley and Colne. It also included the connection to the LNWR at Stockport for through traffic to London. * Eastern Division:  Todmorden to Halifax, Bradford, Leeds, Huddersfield, Wakefield, Normanton, Goole, and Doncaster. Whereas there were various lines split between the Central and Western Divisions there was only one route connecting the Eastern and Central Divisions. This line cut through the Pennines between Lancashire and Yorkshire using a number of long tunnels, the longest of which was Summit Tunnel ( in length) near Rochdale. There were six other tunnels each more than long. Manchester Victoria railway station Manchester Victoria railway station was one of the largest railway stations in the country at the time. It occupied and had 17 platforms with a total length of . After the grouping, a structural change led platform 11 to run through and join with platform 3 in the LNWR's adjacent Exchange station; at between ramps it became the longest railway platform in Britain. Lately the station capacity has been reduced to two platforms for Metrolink trams, two bay platforms, and four through platforms under the Manchester Evening News Arena, which now replaces a significant area once occupied by the station. The main façade and station building of the original Hunts Bank station still exist and are kept in relatively good condition. Electrification The L&YR; was the first in the country to electrify a mainline route. In Liverpool, the fourth rail system pioneered by the tube railways in London was used at 600 V DC, although this was later converted to a third rail system. Suburban lines in the Liverpool area were electrified to reach a total of . * Liverpool Exchange – and : 22 March 1904 * Liverpool – (two routes): July and December 1906 * Southport – : 1909 * Aintree – : 1913 In 1912 Dick, Kerr & Co.'s Preston factory was considering tendering for a Brazilian contract, and approached the L&YR; to use the Bury to Holcombe Brook Line for test purposes at Dick, Kerr's expense. The line from to was electrified with the overhead 3.5 kV DC system; rolling stock was also supplied at their cost. After prolonged trials the trains entered public use on 29 July 1913. The L&YR; purchased the equipment and stock on the successful completion of the trials in 1916. Horwich, 1915 In 1913 a decision was taken to electrify the Manchester to Bury route at 1.2 kV DC in an attempt to overcome competition from electric trams. Using the third rail system, trains powered by electric motor cars (or carriages) began running on 17 April 1916 but as Horwich was by then involved in war work, deliveries of the new electric stock were delayed and it was not until August 1916 that steam trains were withdrawn from the route. In 1920 the L&YR; also considered electrifying the Manchester–Oldham–Shaw and Royton lines, but no work was carried out. During 1917 work began to convert the Bury to Holcombe Brook line to a third rail system, matching the Manchester to Bury system. Third-rail trains started to run on 29 March 1918.

Lining was black and white. In 1876 the dark green was changed to a light green and goods engines were painted plain black. 1878 saw the goods locomotives also appearing in light green. This livery was discontinued from 1883 when all locomotives were painted black. Lining was red and white for passenger locomotives and, if present, red only for goods locomotives. Passenger coaching stock was originally painted teak, changing in 1875 to an overall light brown. In 1879 a decision was made to use 'a little brighter shade'. Finally in June 1881 it was announced that the lower panels were to be painted 'lake colour'. Between 1896 and 1914 the upper panels became buff with the lower in purple-brown, ends were dark brown. Roofs were normally dark grey but some did appear in red oxide. Wagons were unpainted until 1902 except for the ironwork which was black. After 1902 it was painted dark grey. The graphical symbol of an inverted solid triangle within a circle was replaced in 1902–03 with the letters LY. Brake vans were black and special traffic wagons were painted in various colours, such as red for gunpowder, white for fish, and pale blue for butter. The football team of the L&YR; Carriage and Wagon works at Newton Heath, Manchester, evolved into Manchester United F.C.. Accidents The Helmshore rail accident on 4 September 1860 saw 11 people killed and 77 injured when the rear portion of a Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway passenger excursion train became detached and ran back down the line where it collided with an oncoming passenger excursion train. The Burscough Junction crash occurred on 15 January 1880 at the station on the Liverpool to line, resulting in nine fatalities.Rosbottom, Ernest (1987) Burscough – The Story of an Agricultural Village. pp.179, 182. Carnegie Press, Preston. A passenger train ran into a goods train near Mosesgate on 27 October 1880. Several passengers were injured and about a dozen carriages and a number of wagons were damaged. An excursion train was in collision with a West Lancashire Railway passenger train at , Lancashire on 3 August 1896 due to the driver of the excursion train misreading signals. One person was killed and seven were injured. A passenger train was derailed on 15 July 1903 at Waterloo station, then in Lancashire (now Merseyside) caused by a broken spring and spring bridle on the locomotive, while negotiating a curve at speed. Seven people were killed and 116 were injured.Major E Druitt, Report of inquiry into the causes of the accident which occurred on the 15th July to an express passenger train which was derailed at Waterloo on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, Railway Department, Board of Trade, 10 August 1903 An express passenger train collided with a light engine at , Yorkshire on 22 October 1903 due to a signalman's error. A third train collided with the wreckage at low speed. One person was killed. A collision between a London and North Western Railway (LNWR) empty stock train and a passenger train at , Yorkshire on 21 April 1905 killed two people. The driver of the LNWR train had overrun signals, but fatigue was a contributory factor. The Hall Road rail accident at Blundellsands in what is now Merseyside on 27 July 1905 saw 20 killed and 48 injured when two Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway electric passenger trains collided due to human error on the part of a signalman and a train driver. Two locomotives were shunted into a siding at Hindley & Blackrod Junction, Lancashire on 22 January 1909, but one of them remained foul of the main line. A passenger train collided with it, killing one person and injuring 33. A passenger train was derailed on the Charlestown Curve when the track spread under it on 21 June 1912. Four people were killed and twelve were injured. A freight train became divided on 28 October 1913. The rear portion ran back and was derailed at , Yorkshire. On 18 March 1915, an express passenger train overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with an empty stock train at , Lancashire. Four people were killed and 33 were injured. A viaduct at Penistone, Yorkshire collapsed on 2 February 1916 due to subsidence. A locomotive was on the bridge at the time, but its crew had time to escape before it fell. A freight train became divided at Pendlebury, Lancashire. The rear portion was too heavy for the banking locomotive to hold, and it was pushed back downhill and derailed by catch points, as were the wagons. The Lostock Junction train collision near Bolton on 17 July 1920 saw four fatalities and 148 injured as the result of a near head-on collision between two Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway passenger trains due to a signal having been passed at danger Post-grouping history On 25 March 1921, the L&YR; and LNWR agreed terms under which the two railways would amalgamate. Before this could occur, the Railways Act 1921 became law on 19 August 1921, under which the L&YR; and LNWR would be forced to amalgamate on 1 January 1923 with each other and with other railways, such as the Midland Railway and the Caledonian Railway. The Act included provisions for two or more railways to amalgamate voluntarily before 1923; and the L&YR; and LNWR took the opportunity to implement their March 1921 agreement, and on 1 January 1922 both railways were dissolved and a new company was formed, which was also named the London and North Western Railway; its board of twenty directors included six from the former L&YR.; The 1923 Grouping duly occurred one years later, which involved the expanded LNWR forming part of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The general manager, secretary and chief mechanical engineer positions of the expanded company were taken by L&YR; employees. Ex-L&YR; lines formed the core of the LMS's Central Division. The LMS did little to develop the former L&YR; routes, which in many places ran parallel to ex-LNWR or ex-Midland routes now forming part of the same network. Nationalisation followed in 1948 followed by a period of rationalisation and modernisation. The L&YR; system has survived largely intact, although the following routes have been closed, many within the L&YR;'s old East Lancashire division: *Bury to Manchester (converted to Manchester Metrolink operation in 1992) *Bury to Clifton Junction, closed 1966 *Bury/Radcliffe to Bolton, closed 1970 *Bury to Rochdale, closed to regular passenger traffic 1970, but now partly preserved as the East Lancashire Railway heritage railway line *Bury to Accrington/Bacup, closed to regular passenger traffic in 1966, but now partly preserved as the East Lancashire Railway heritage railway line *Bury to Holcombe Brook, fully closed 1963 *Rochdale to Bacup, fully closed 1967 *Rochdale to Manchester via Oldham – The Oldham Loop, now converted to Manchester Metrolink operation *Blackburn to Burnley via Padiham – The North Lancs or Great Harwood Loop, closed 1964 *Blackburn to Chorley, closed 1960 *Preston to Southport, closed 1964 *Preston to Longridge, closed 1930 *Southport to Altcar, closed 1952 The routes today Most ex-L&YR; routes are now operated by Northern. Manchester Victoria station has been rebuilt in a more modest form and retains the former terminal building. The Caldervale Line, as named by West Yorkshire Metro, is also operated by Northern and uses a large part of the former L&YR.; Locomotives The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway locomotive works were originally at Miles Platting, Manchester. From 1889 they were at Horwich. Surviving stock To see surviving L&YR; steam locomotives, go to Locomotives of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Surviving coaching stock of L&YR; origin go as far as 1878, with Directors Saloon No. 1 being privately preserved at the Keighley & Worth Valley Railway.

Many L&YR; carriages, that were sold to the Barry Railway Company also survive, one being a birdcage brake from 1882. A dynamometer car also survives at the Midland Rail Centre in Butterley. Mostly covered goods vans survive in the form of L&YR; goods stock, some of these vans also passed into Cadbury ownership for use at Bournville. A brake van also survives at the Kent & East Sussex Railway and the body of a CCT van at the Cambrian Heritage Railways in Oswestry. Shipping The L&YR; had the largest ship fleet of all the pre-grouping railway companies. In 1902 the assets of the Drogheda Steam Packet Company were acquired for the sum of £80,000New Zealand Tablet, 9 January 1902. (). In 1905 they took over the Goole Steam Shipping Company. By 1913 they owned 26 vessels, with another two under construction, plus a further five under joint ownership with the London and North Western Railway. The L&YR; ran steamers between Liverpool and Drogheda, Hull and Zeebrugge, and between Goole and many continental ports including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Hamburg, and Rotterdam. The jointly-owned vessels provided services between Fleetwood, Belfast and Derry.

Personal life Lawrence and Gorme with sons David (left) and Michael (right). Gene Kelly is also pictured with his son, Tim (left) and daughter, Bridget (right). Kelly was a guest on the couple's 1975 television special, \\"Our Love Is Here to Stay\\". Lawrence and Gormé married on December 29, 1957, at the El Rancho Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. They had two sons together. David Nessim Lawrence (b. 1960) is an ASCAP Award-winning composer who composed the score for High School Musical. Michael Robert Lawrence (1962–1986) died suddenly from ventricular fibrillation resulting from an undiagnosed heart condition at the age of 23. Michael was an assistant editor for a television show at the time of his death and was apparently healthy despite a previous diagnosis of slight arrhythmia. Gormé and Lawrence were in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time of Michael's death, having performed at the Fox Theater the night before. Upon learning of the death, family friend Frank Sinatra sent his private plane to fly the couple to New York to meet David, who was attending school at the time. Following their son's death, Gormé and Lawrence took a year off before touring again. Gormé died on August 10, 2013. In June 2019, Lawrence was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

Early in his career on the Manchester Evening News, Haley was found to be too shy to work as a reporter. He was then transferred to subediting.Harold Evans, Essential English for Journalists, Editors and Writers 2000 p.10 He rose through the ranks becoming director of Manchester Guardian and Evening News, Ltd after 8 years. He served as Director-General of the BBC from 1944 to 1952 and from 1952 to 1966 he was editor of The Times. At The Times he wrote a series of light-hearted bookish articles under the pseudonym 'Oliver Edwards'. These articles were published in 1957 by Heinemann as 'Talking of Books'. While at the BBC he created the BBC Third Programme, which was replaced by BBC Radio 3 in 1970. He was made Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1946. He was editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica from January 1968 until resigning in April 1969 in an editorial dispute over how to adapt the work to new readers. It was reported that younger executives (including the company's president, Charles E. Swanson) wanted to introduce livelier materials, while Haley favoured the traditional approach and an expansion in size.Henry Raymont, \\"Encyclopaedia Britannica Feud Seen\\", New York Times, April 20, 1969 Sir William died in a nursing home in Jersey.

Early life Jacob was born in 1899 in Quetta, Pakistan (then a part of the British Empire). His father was Field Marshal Sir Claud Jacob, in whose footsteps Ian followed by becoming a professional soldier with the Royal Engineers in 1918, after being educated at both Wellington College, Berkshire and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In 1924, Jacob married Cecil Treherne, the daughter of another senior army officer, Surgeon Major-General Sir Francis Treherne. The couple had two sons. Jacob trained as an officer at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and later at the Staff College, Camberley from 1931 to 1932, (where he passed the entrance examination with record marks), his fellow students there including Brian Horrocks, Sidney Kirkman, Frank Simpson, Cameron Nicholson, Arthur Dowler, Nevil Brownjohn, and Thomas Rees. He also studied at Kings College, Cambridge. Wartime work Jacob served as the Military Assistant Secretary to the War Cabinet for the duration of the Second World War (he actually asked to be returned to his regiment in 1940, but was refused). He worked closely with Winston Churchill and implemented Churchill's communications during his thirteen wartime journeys outside the United Kingdom. Churchill valued Jacob's efforts enough to endorse his promotion from the rank of colonel to lieutenant general over the course of the war. As a brigadier (war-substantive lieutenant-colonel), Jacob was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel in the Regular Army on 30 June 1943. He was granted the acting rank of major- general on 8 September 1944 and advanced to temporary major-general on 8 September 1945. In the 1944 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion in the Military Division of the Order of the Bath (CB). Post-war As Jacob had never been in command of troops, he had few prospects for serious work in the forces after the war and sought to make use of his experience in communications. Indeed, he was one of a number of wartime information service staff who moved into broadcasting after 1945. Jacob retired from the Army on 1 July 1946 with the honorary rank of major-general. By the end of the war, the BBC's European Service (later the BBC World Service), based at Bush House, had become the world's most respected and sophisticated foreign language broadcasting operation and had been admired for its contribution to the war effort. After the war, however, its significance was greatly reduced and its future in some doubt. The departing head of the service, Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick (who would become the Chairman of the Independent Television Authority a decade later), recommended Jacob as a potential successor. Sir William Haley, the BBC's Director-General, had already met Jacob during preparations to report the news of the D-Day landings and was aware that his political contacts (Churchill in particular) could be valuable. He heeded Kirkpatrick's recommendation, and Jacob was duly appointed Controller of the European Service following his retirement from the Army. Jacob accepted the post shortly after receiving a knighthood for his work with the war cabinet. In 1947, Haley decided to rationalise the BBC's overlapping European and Overseas services into a single operation. Jacob's successful management of Bush House led to his being appointed Director of the reconstructed Overseas service in which post he continued until 1951. In February 1950, he helped to establish the European Broadcasting Union (responsible for the Eurovision Song Contest and similar events) and served as its first President until 1960. Back into government Churchill was re-elected in 1951 and in addition to being Prime Minister, he also took the office of Secretary of State for Defence. He immediately asked for William Haley to second Jacob from the BBC to reprise his advisory role, this time under the title of Chief Staff Officer. After a single visit to the United States of America and Canada, Churchill had realised that the Defence portfolio was relatively dull during peacetime; he left the post and appointed Field Marshal the Earl Alexander as his replacement. Jacob was less comfortable working for Alexander than for Churchill, but a new opportunity arose for him in June 1952, when Haley announced he was to leave the BBC to become editor of The Times. Jacob as BBC Director-General As Haley departed, it was apparent that Jacob was likely to succeed him in the role of Director-General. Jacob was well respected by the senior staff of the BBC, much more so than the other candidate George Barnes, then the controller of BBC television. (Barnes had been appointed Controller of Television in 1950, despite having no enthusiasm for visual broadcasting, and was not popular within the BBC. Indeed, the BBC's regional controllers informed the Chairman, Lord Simon of Wythenshawe, that they would resign simultaneously if Barnes was chosen over Jacob as Haley's replacement). However, Jacob was still officially seconded to the Ministry of Defence, and so a member of the Board of Management, Sir Basil Nicholls, was made acting Director-General until Jacob could be released back to the BBC. Jacob eventually entered his new job on 1 December 1952. Jacob's tenure coincided with the rise of television, which was beginning to displace radio as the main broadcast medium (sales of Sound-and-Television licences overtook those of Sound-only licences in 1957). In contrast to Haley's hard-bitten era, Jacob's was a time of financial prosperity for the BBC. Indeed, he initially found it hard to persuade senior staff that money was available and that there was ample opportunity to spend it in developing television to the full. Jacob was an enthusiast of news and current affairs programming and was keen to continue the BBC's tradition of accuracy and impartiality in its journalism. However, this goal led him to misinterpret the intentions of the controversial Editor of News, Tahu Hole, who was inclined to abuse the impartiality principle to avoid management responsibilities. In fact, it was only in 1958, by which time BBC News was being put to shame by its competitor Independent Television News, that Jacob finally noticed Hole's shortcomings and moved him into an administrative post. Jacob did, however, campaign for the abolition of the restrictive Fourteen-Day Rule that prevented broadcast analysis of topics that were to be debated in parliament within the next fourteen days (the Rule was finally suspended in December 1956). Also during Jacob's time as Director- General was the first showing of Panorama which is the world's longest-running current affairs series as of 2017. Jacob's approach to news coverage was not always popular with the government. His former mentor Winston Churchill in particular had never liked the BBC's journalistic impartiality, thinking that broadcast media should be a tool of government rather than a forum of political analysis and criticism. Churchill's successor as Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, objected to the BBC's reporting of the 1956 Suez Crisis. Eden insisted that unfavourable reports of the British bombardment of Egypt should not be broadcast to the world on the BBC's Overseas Service, but Jacob refused to compromise:- Eden responded by cutting the budget of the Overseas Service (which was, unlike today's World Service, funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office rather than the Licence fee which funded the rest of the BBC). However, this punitive measure was lifted after Eden's resignation in 1957 with no further restrictions on the BBC's journalistic freedom. Jacob was replaced as Director-General in 1960 by Hugh Carleton Greene. Though less radical (and certainly less well-known) than Greene, he saw the BBC successfully through many significant events in British broadcasting: the surge in television viewership (aided especially by the coverage of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952); the introduction of the competing ITV service in 1955; the gradual modernisation of some old eccentric practices (the aforementioned Fourteen-Day Rule and the Toddlers' Truce closedown period in the early evening). It was also mostly on the strength of Jacob's work that the 1960 Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting recommended that the third television channel should be offered to the BBC, eventually materialising as BBC2 in 1964. Jacob's date of retirement was 31 December 1959. The following day, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year's Honours. Later life Jacob was the co-author (along with Lord Ismay) of the 1963 Report on the Central Organisation of Defence, a work he later came to regard as his most important ever. He was also a trustee of the Imperial War Museum between 1966 and 1973 and was a County Councillor in Suffolk for two separate periods (1960–1970 and 1974–1977). He was a Deputy Lieutenant for the county from 1964 to 1968.Smart, p. 172 References ;Notes ;Sources  * Category:1899 births Category:1993 deaths Category:BBC executives Category:British Army generals of World War II Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Quetta Category:Royal Engineers officers Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Suffolk Category:Councillors in Suffolk ","title":"Ian Jacob"},{"id":"564123","text":"Mark Julian Byford (born 13 June 1958) was Deputy Director General of the British Broadcasting Corporation and head of BBC Journalism from 2004–2011. He chaired the BBC Journalism Board and had overall responsibility for the world's largest news organisation and all its radio, television and interactive journalism content across the UK and around the world. He was a member of the BBC Executive Board for thirteen years. His responsibilities also included BBC Sport, the Nations and Regions (BBC Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and English regions) and Editorial Policy. He led the BBC- wide coverage of the General Elections in 2005 and 2010; the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008; and the BBC coverage of the Queen Mother's Funeral in 2002 and the Royal Wedding in 2011. Byford established and chaired the BBC's Editorial Standards Board, which is responsible for promoting the BBC's standards in ethics and programme-making across the Corporation. He also established and chaired the Complaints Management Board, which oversees the handling of complaints across the BBC. In addition, he was the chair of the BBC Academy Board co-ordinating all its training and development. He was in overall charge of the BBC's planning for the London 2012 Olympic Games as Chair of the London 2012 Steering Group. On 12 October 2010 it was announced that Byford had accepted voluntary redundancy. He stood down from the Executive Board in March 2011 and left the Corporation in June 2011.Neil Midgley \\"BBC's Mark Byford made redundant\\", The Daily Telegraph, 11 October 2010 After leaving the BBC, Byford became a writer as well as focusing on voluntary and charitable work. His first book, A Name on a Wall, about an American soldier killed in the Vietnam War, was published by Mainstream Publishing in November 2013. His second book, The Annunciation: A Pilgrim's Quest, a personal search to understand the meaning of Luke's Gospel story, was published in April 2018. He is currently a Lay Canon and member of the Chapter at Winchester Cathedral. He is also a Governor at the University of Winchester ; a Trustee of the Winchester Hospice Fundraising charity; and a Trustee of Play to the Crowd, the charity that runs Winchester Theatre Royal and the Hat Fair. He was made a Vice President of the RNLI in 2019 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the charity whilst a Trustee from 2012-2019, where he was Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and, previously, Chair of the Fundraising and Communications Committee. Early life Byford was born in Castleford, Yorkshire. He spent his early years living around the West Riding of Yorkshire , where his father, Sir Lawrence Byford, served as a policeman. Sir Lawrence went on to Chief Constable of Lincolnshire, and later, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Mark was educated at Lincoln School which later became Christ's Hospital Comprehensive School. He returned to West Yorkshire in 1976, studying Law at the University of Leeds, where he was president of Devonshire Hall. Immediately on graduating he joined the BBC in 1979, aged 20, as a \\"temporary holiday relief assistant\\" working as a researcher over the summer holiday in his local (Look North) television newsroom in Leeds. After three months' vacation work, he joined the BBC full- time. Career with the BBC In 1981, aged just 22, he produced the Royal Television Society's Regional News programme of the Year – a BBC Look North special on unemployment in the north of England. The following year, in 1982, he produced the award-winning edition again – this time with South Today in Southampton. In 1987 he became Head of News at BBC Bristol before becoming Home Editor BBC News and Current Affairs, responsible for all television network newsgathering coverage across the UK. There he led the BBC's coverage of the Clapham rail crash, the Kegworth M1 air crash, the Lockerbie bombing, the Hillsborough football tragedy, and the Marchioness riverboat disaster. In 1990 he returned to Leeds as Head of Centre. In 1991 he became Controller Regional Broadcasting aged 33. He joined the BBC's Board of Management in 1996 as Director, Regional Broadcasting responsible for all the BBC's activities across the UK, outside London. In 1997–98, he drew up the BBC's response to devolution and helped to devise and implement the policy to increase the level of network programming production outside London. In 1998 he became Director of the BBC World Service and then Head of the BBC's multi-media Global News Division in 2002. In January 2004 he became Deputy Director General of the BBC but within three weeks of his appointment, Greg Dyke resigned as Director General, following the publication of the Hutton Report. Byford was appointed by the Board of Governors as Acting Director-General, a role that he undertook for five months. During this period, Byford had a lead role in producing \\"Building Public Value\\", the BBC's Charter renewal manifesto. When Mark Thompson was appointed Director General in June 2004, Byford's role was enlarged to take responsibility for all the BBC's journalism at UK, international and local levels – the first time such a post leading the BBC's Journalism at all levels across radio, television and online, had been established. In July 2006, he also became responsible for BBC Sport. In June 2008 the BBC's governing body, the BBC Trust, in a direct criticism of BBC News, instructed Byford and his editors to \\"improve the range, clarity and precision of its network coverage of the different UK nations and regions\\". The Trust said the BBC was \\"falling short of its own high standards\\" and, in part, failing to meet its core purpose of helping inform democracy. Three years later, Professor Anthony King, the author of the original report for the Trust, said there \\"had been enormous change in how the BBC reported the devolved nations. They make many fewer mistakes than they used to.\\" As Chair of the BBC's Editorial Standards Board, Byford led the Executive's response to the faked competitions scandals that engulfed the Corporation in 2007 including designing the special training programme \\"Safeguarding Trust\\" which more than 17,000 members of staff had to attend. In November 2008, he led the investigation into the Brand/Ross affair and produced the special report that was published subsequently by the BBC Trust. He is a Fellow of The Radio Academy. He was a first board member of the joint industry radio research body, RAJAR, in the early 1990s and was also a board member of BARB, the television audience research body. He was a trustee of the Children in Need charity from 1992 to 1996. In 1999, he established the BBC World Service Trust, the BBC's international development charity, which used media and communications to reduce poverty and promote education and human rights around the world. In July 2010, it was revealed that Byford had flown on business to the World Cup in South Africa business class at a cost of £4,878. This came against a background of further cuts in BBC News, for which Byford was responsible. On 12 October 2010 it was announced Byford was leaving the Corporation after thirty two years and the Deputy Director General post closed as part of the BBC's cutbacks in senior management costs. Byford left the Executive Board of the BBC at the end of March 2011, and his BBC employment ended in the early summer after he led the Royal Wedding coverage, reportedly with a redundancy/notice package of between £800,000 and £900,000. On his retirement The Guardian commented:- \\"If he has a public profile at all it is because Byford came to symbolise the apparent excesses of top executive pay at the corporation. There he was, grey man with a job for life, half a million pounds in salary and, because he had been at the BBC so long without ever leaving, an uncapped two-thirds final salary pension entitlement and no obvious market rate comparator to justify such riches. It was very easy to put the question, as even many lower ranking BBC staff did – who else would pay Mark Byford £500,000 and for what? – knowing there was no very good answer.\\" However, the remainder of that article, written by media commentator, Steve Hewlett, suggested that his presence might be missed greatly at the Corporation. \\"He made things happen and by common consent brought a firm moral sense to everything he did, rising above his own particular interests.\\" It went on to highlight how he was a stabilising influence on Director General, Mark Thompson.That opinion appeared highly prophetic in the light of the two major Newsnight scandals – concerning Sir Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine respectively – which engulfed the BBC within 18 months of Byford's departure. Both of those incidents led to widespread adverse criticism of high level management of journalism within the BBC and were surrounded by suggestions that the Director General of the day was not sufficiently informed about issues highly significant for the reputation of the Corporation. The subsequent Pollard Review highlighted that several witnesses had said \\"they believe the Savile affair and, in particular, the BBC's poor handling of it after the investigation was halted, would not have happened if the role of Deputy Director General occupied by Mark Byford had still been in existence.\\" Media commentators agreed with that view. Professor Stewart Purvis said: \\"He watched the DG's back and he watched the BBC's back. Margaret Thatcher once declared: \\"Every Prime Minister needs a Willie (Whitelaw). Now the chorus is growing that every DG needs a Mark B.\\" Peter Preston described him as: \\"a news aware Deputy, a safety net, a mopper up of perilous trifles.\\" After leaving the BBC, Byford has pursued a fresh path as a writer of non-fiction. His first book, A Name On A Wall: Two Men, Two Wars, Two Destinies was published by Mainstream in 2013. It tells the contrasting stories of an American soldier, Larry Byford, killed in the Vietnam War in 1967 and his own father, Lawry Byford, who served alongside the Americans in the Second World War. Jan C. Scruggs, the President and Founder of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, described it as \\"an amazing journey that unfolded as a mission. An extraordinary experience like nothing ever done before in America. It's important. It matters.\\" Julian Pettifer, the BAFTA award-winning Vietnam war reporter, wrote \\"This tale should be compulsory reading for MPs and military leaders and anyone else who might lead us into armed conflict. An absorbing and meticulously researched work.\\" His second book, The Annunciation: A Pilgrim's Quest, was published by Winchester University Press in April 2018. Inspired by a chance viewing of an Annunciation painting by François Lemoyne in The National Gallery, on loan from Winchester College, he searches for the spiritual meaning of Luke's biblical story through intimate conversations with more than a hundred senior clerics, theologians and art historians, as well as viewing more than a hundred acclaimed Annunciation images, during a three-year 30,000 mile journey. Personal life He is married to Hilary Bleiker, whom he met whilst at Leeds University where she studied English, and they have five adult children, two sons and three daughters. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree by the University of Leeds in 2008. He and his family live in Winchester. In 2006 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Winchester, and in 2010 an honorary doctorate by the University of Lincoln, the city where he spent his teenage years. He has been a Lay Canon and member of Chapter at Winchester Cathedral since 2017. He has been a Governor of the University of Winchester since 2014; a Trustee of the Winchester Hospice Fundraising Charity since 2018; and a Trustee of Play to the Crowd, the charity that runs Winchester Theatre Royal and the Hat Fair, since 2018. He was made a Vice President of the RNLI in 2019 in recognition of his outstanding contribution as a Trustee from 2012 - 2019.

It was formed in the early 19th century with the objective of forming a link between English railways and Glasgow. It progressively extended its network and reached Edinburgh and Aberdeen, with a dense network of branch lines in the area surrounding Glasgow. It was absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Many of its principal routes are still used, and the original main line between Carlisle and Glasgow is in use as part of the West Coast Main Line railway (with a modified entry into Glasgow itself). Introduction Caledonian locomotive CR 419 at the Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway (formerly part of the North British Railway). In the mid-1830s railways in England evolved from local concerns to longer routes that connected cities, and then became networks. In Scotland it was clear that this was the way forward, and there was a desire to connect the central belt to the incipient English network. There was controversy over the route that such a line might take, but the Caledonian Railway was formed on 31 July 1845 and it opened its main line between Glasgow, Edinburgh and Carlisle in 1848, making an alliance with the English London and North Western Railway. In the obituary of the engineer Richard Price-Williams written in 1916 the contractor of the Caledonian Railway is stated to be Thomas Brassey and the civil engineer George Heald.Obituary of Richard Price-Williams Although the company was supported by Scottish investors, more than half of its shares were held in England.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System: 1722–1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, first edition 1983, Establishing itself as an inter-city railway, the Caledonian set about securing territory by leasing other authorised or newly built lines, and fierce competition developed with other, larger Scottish railways, particularly the North British Railway and the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The company established primacy in some areas, but remained less than successful in others; considerable sums were expended in the process, not always finding the approval of shareholders. A considerable passenger traffic developed on the Firth of Clyde serving island resorts, and fast boat trains were run from Glasgow to steamer piers; the company was refused permission to operate its own steamers, and it formed a partnership with a nominally independent, but friendly, operator, the Caledonian Steam Packet Company. In 1923 the railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" under the Railways Act 1921 and the Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the newly formed London Midland and Scottish Railway; its capitalisation at that time was £57 million (equivalent to £ today), and it had a single track mileage of . It extended from Aberdeen to Portpatrick, and from Oban to Carlisle, running express passenger services and a heavy mineral traffic. Early history The Lanarkshire coal lines In the closing years of the 18th century, the pressing need to bring coal cheaply to Glasgow from the plentiful Monklands coalfield had been met by the construction of the Monkland Canal, opened throughout in 1794.Guthrie Hutton, Monkland: the Canal that Made Money, Richard Stenlake, Ochiltree, 1993, George Thomson, The Monkland Canal - a Sketch of the Early History, originally written in 1945, published by Monkland Library Services Department, 1984, This encouraged development of the coalfield but dissatisfaction at the monopoly prices said to be exacted by the canal led to the construction of the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway (M&KR;), Scotland's first public railway; it opened in 1826. Development of the use of blackband ironstone by David Mushet, and the invention of the hot blast process of iron smelting by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828 led to a huge and rapid increase in iron production and demand for the ore and for coal in the Coatbridge area. The industrial development led to the construction of other railways contiguous with the M&KR;, in particular the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway and the Wishaw and Coltness Railway. These two lines worked in harmony, merging to form the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway in 1841, and competing with the M&KR; and its allies. All these lines used the local track gauge of , and they were referred to as the coal lines; passenger traffic was not a dominant activity.Don Martin, The Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway, Strathkelvin Public Libraries, Kirkintilloch, 1976Don Martin, The Monkland and Kirkintilloch and Associated Railways, Strathkelvin Public Libraries, Kirkintilloch, 1995, Don Martin, The Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, Strathkelvin District Libraries and Museums, 1981 English railways Former Caledonian Main Line, Edinburgh 2011During this period, the first long- distance railways were opened in England; the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first inter-city line, opened in 1830 and was an immediate success.Frank Ferneyhough, The Liverpool & Manchester Railway, 1830–1980, Robert Hale Ltd., London, 1980, It was quickly followed by the Grand Junction Railway in 1837,Norman W Webster, Britain's First Trunk Line – the Grand Junction Railway, Adams and Dart, Bath, 1972, the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838David Gould, The London & Birmingham Railway 150 Years On, David & Charles plc, Newton Abbot, 1987, and the North Union Railway reaching Preston in 1838, so that London was linked with the Lancashire and West Midlands centres of industry. Connecting Scotland and London It was clearly desirable to connect central Scotland into the emerging network. At first it was assumed that only one route from Scotland to England would be feasible, and there was considerable controversy over the possible route. A major difficulty was the terrain of the Southern Uplands: a route running through the hilly lands would involve steep and lengthy gradients that were challenging for the engine power of the time; a route around them, either to the west or the east, involved much lengthier main lines, and made connection to both Edinburgh and Glasgow more problematic. Many competing schemes were put forward, not all of them well thought out, and two successive Government commissions examined them. However, they did not have mandatory force, and after considerable rivalry, the Caledonian Railway obtained an authorising Act of Parliament on 31 July 1845, for lines from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle. The share capital was to be £1,800,000 (equivalent to £ today). The Glasgow and Edinburgh lines combined at Carstairs in Clydesdale, and the route then crossed over Beattock summit and continued on through Annandale.O.S. Nock The Caledonian Railway, Ian Allan The promoters had engaged in a frenzy of provisional acquisitions of other lines being put forward or already being constructed, as they considered it was vital to secure territory to their own control and to exclude competing concerns as far as possible. However, if they hoped to operate the only Anglo-Scottish route, they were disappointed. The North British Railway opened between Edinburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed on 22 June 1846,John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, David Ross, The North British Railway — A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, forming part of what has become the East Coast Main Line. The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway had opened in 1841 with the declared intention of reaching Carlisle by way of Dumfries; it did so in 1850, changing its name then to the Glasgow and South Western Railway.The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2104, David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The main line The Caledonian Railway first main lineThe main line was opened from Carlisle to Beattock on 10 September 1847, and throughout between Glasgow and Carlisle on 15 February 1848. A continuous railway route between Glasgow and London existed for the first time. (It had been possible to travel via Edinburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne since 1846, but this involved crossing the River Tweed at Berwick by road, and the River Tyne at Newcastle by ferry.) The Caledonian Railway's Edinburgh line from Carstairs opened on 1 April 1848. The terminal at Edinburgh was Lothian Road. Glasgow was reached over the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway (successor to the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway), and the Wishaw and Coltness Railway, which the Caledonian had leased from 1 January 1847 and 1 January 1846 respectively. The Glasgow station was the Townhead terminus of the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway. During the process of seeking Parliamentary authorisation, the Caledonian observed that the Clydesdale Junction Railway was being promoted. The Caledonian acquired that line during its construction, and it opened in 1849. It gave an alternative, and shorter access to another Glasgow passenger terminal, named South Side, and to the Clyde Quays at General Terminus (over the connected General Terminus and Glasgow Harbour Railway). The South Side station was already being used by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, worked by the Caledonian. One day, they hoped, they might extend that line into Ayrshire. Meanwhile, the line was leased (for 999 years) to the Caledonian in 1849. The Caledonian recognised that the Townhead terminus was unsatisfactory and constructed a deviation from Milton Junction to a new Glasgow terminus at Buchanan Street. It opened on 1 November 1849. Trains to Edinburgh, Stirling and Carlisle used the new station; the Stirling trains had to reverse at Gartsherrie Junction. The Garnkirk's old Glebe Street (Townhead) station was reduced to goods and mineral duties. In 1853 or 1854 the Hayhill Fork, between Gartcosh and Garnqueen, was opened, enabling direct running from Buchanan Street towards Stirling. Financial problems, and Greenock amalgamation In the period between formation of the Caledonian Railway and the opening of the main line, a large number of leases and working arrangements had been concluded with other railways being promoted or built. This was mostly done by guaranteeing those shareholders an income on their capital, which meant no immediate cash was required. When the lines started working, suddenly a huge periodical payment was required, and the income was inadequate to satisfy it. There were also suggestions of improper share acquisitions, and in the period 1848 to 1850 a number of shareholder inquiries disclosed bad practices, and many board members had to resign in February 1850. The Company had obtained Parliamentary powers to merge with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway (GP&GR;) in 1847, but even more alarming revelations of financial impropriety emerged regarding that company, and the Caledonian considered getting authorisation to cancel the amalgamation. However, it was later decided to proceed, and the amalgamation took place by Act of Parliament of 7 August 1851. The GP&GR; operated the line between Glasgow and Paisley jointly with the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;), and the Paisley line used a terminus at Bridge Street, in Glasgow. The Caledonian now worked trains at three termini in Glasgow: Buchanan Street, South Side (from the Clydesdale Junction line, mostly used for local trains to Motherwell and Hamilton), and Bridge Street (on the Paisley line). Gradually the financial difficulties were got under control, by economy, and by the discovery that several of the lease agreements were illegal.Ross, p. 63 Handsome dividends continued to be paid, but it was not until March 1853 that the dividend was paid wholly from revenue.The earlier practice of paying dividends from capital made some shareholders feel good, but gave a misleading indication that the company was profitable. South Lanarkshire: mainly mineral traffic If the Caledonian Railway had been formed as an inter-city trunk line, its attention was early on turned to other demands. Local interests in Lanark promoted a branch line to their town, opening in 1855. Coal owners in South Lanarkshire pressed for a railway connection, and the Lesmahagow Railway was formed by them, opening in 1856. It was later absorbed by the Caledonian, but other lines followed in the sparsely populated but mineral-rich area. As new coal mines opened, so new branches were needed, connecting Coalburn, Stonehouse, Strathaven, Muirkirk and Darvel and many other places, with new lines built right up until 1905. When the coal became exhausted in the second half of the twentieth century, the railways were progressively closed; passenger traffic had always been light and it too disappeared. Only the passenger traffic to the Lanark and Larkhall branches remain in operation. North Lanarkshire In North Lanarkshire the North British Railway was a keen competitor, having taken over the Monkland Railways. The area contained the rapidly growing iron production area surrounding Coatbridge, and servicing that industry with coal and iron ore, and transport to local and more distant metal processing locations, dominated the Caledonian's activity in the region. The Rutherglen and Coatbridge line, later linking Airdie, and the Carfin to Midcalder line were routes with significant passenger traffic. Many lines to coal and iron ore pits further east were built, but serving remote areas the lines closed when the mineral extraction ceased. Developing the network: to 1880 Busby and East Kilbride With the Barrhead line in full operation, interests in Busby wanted a railway connection. The wealthy middle class saw the town as an elegant location and the Busby Railway opened in 1866. Commuting was already in fashion. The line was extended to East Kilbride in 1868, although at that time (long before the New Town) the village did not generate much business for the railway. Branches south of Carstairs When the main line was built, no branches were provided in the thinly populated terrain. Four independent companies made branches themselves, and the Caledonian built two. Shades of the past. A former Caledonian Railway building in Hamilton, Scotland. The Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway was opened in 1860, having been taken over by the Caledonian during construction. It was extended to Peebles in 1864. In 1863 an independent line, the Dumfries, Lochmaben and Lockerbie Railway was opened. The line was encouraged by the Caledonian Railway, giving westward access into Dumfriesshire, and worked by it; the Caledonian acquired the line in 1865. The Portpatrick Railway had opened between Castle Douglas and Portpatrick in 1861–1862 and the Caledonian Railway worked that railway; it obtained running powers over the G&SWR; between Dumfries and Castle Douglas, and at a stroke the Caledonian had penetrated deep into the south- west, and to the ferry service to the north of Ireland, territory that the G&SWR; had assumed was its own. The Portpatrick Railway later reformed with the Wigtownshire Railway as the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway; the Caledonian was a one-quarter owner.C E J Fryer, The Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Railways, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1991, David L Smith, The Little Railways of South West Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, The North British Railway opened the branch line to Dolphinton, east of Carstairs, and the Caledonian feared that the next step would be an incursion by the NBR into Caledonian territory, possibly seeking running powers on the main line. To head this off, the Caledonian built its own Dolphinton branch from Carstairs; it opened in 1867. Dolphinton had a population of 260 and two railways, and traffic was correspondingly meagre, and the line closed in 1945 (passengers) and 1950 (goods). The independent Solway Junction Railway was opened in 1869, linking iron mines in Cumberland with the Caledonian Railway at Kirtlebridge, crossing the Solway Firth by a viaduct; the company worked the line itself. It considerably shortened the route to the Lanarkshire ironworks, and was heavily used at first, but the traffic was depleted by cheap imported iron ore within a decade. The Scottish part of the line was acquired by the Caledonian Railway in 1873, and the whole line in 1895. Serious ice damage and later heavy maintenance costs made the line seriously unprofitable and it was closed in 1921.Stuart Edgar and John M Sinton, The Solway Junction Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1990, Glasgow Central station When the Caledonian's first main line opened, it used the Townhead terminus of the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway, and almost simultaneously, it acquired access to the South Side station planned for the Clydesdale Junction Railway. It extended from Townhead to Buchanan Street, an \\"inadequate and very cramped station\\"Ross, p. 64 in 1849, but the route from there to the southwards main line was very circuitous. The Caledonian also worked the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway with a terminus at Bridge Street, also inconveniently situated south of the Clyde: the Caledonian, therefore, had three unsatisfactory Glasgow termini. As early as 1846 proposals to cross the Clyde from Gushetfaulds to a Dunlop Street terminal had been put forward; the idea was killed by fierce opposition from the Clyde Bridges Trust (which would lose toll income) and the Admiralty (who insisted on a swing bridge).Colin Johnston and John R Hume, Glasgow Stations, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1979, Another scheme failed to get finance in 1866 and again in 1873, but in 1875 an Act was obtained to build a bridge crossing the Clyde and bringing the South Side route into the city centre. A four track railway bridge crossing the river was designed by Blyth and Cunningham and built by Sir William Arrol & Co.; the Clyde railway bridge was complete on 1 October 1878. The new Glasgow Central station on Gordon Street opened in December 1879. It had eight platforms, but was considered to be unsatisfactory, having narrow platforms; the circulating area was \\"ridiculously small\\"; there was no good cab stance and inadequate siding accommodation.Johnston and Hume, p. 37 The Bridge Street terminus was jointly operated with the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;); it had to be reconstructed as a through station, and the Greenock line trains (operated by the Caledonian) continued to use it. A ninth platform was added to Central station in 1889, but a major expansion took place in the years 1901–1906, when the platforms were lengthened and four platforms added on the west side; a second river crossing was provided. In 1904 Bridge Street station was substantially changed to provide carriage washing and stabling facilities; it closed as a passenger station on 1 March 1905. Central station was operated by a single signal box, staffed with ten men. It was commissioned on 3 May 1908; it had 374 miniature levers, the largest of its type in the world, operating points and signals by electro-pneumatic and electro-magnetic equipment. Extending the network after 1880 Moffat Railway The Moffat Railway was opened from Beattock on 2 April 1883. It was just over long. It was worked by the Caledonian and absorbed on 11 November 1889. The Caledonian Railway sought to develop both Moffat and Peebles as watering places, and ran The Tinto Express from both places, combining at Symington, to Edinburgh and Glasgow for several years. With the intention of revitalising the lead mining industry, the Leadhills and Wanlockhead Branch was opened as a light railway from Elvanfoot in 1901 - 1902. With challenging gradients to reach Scotland's highest village in otherwise remote territory, the line scraped a bare living and closed in 1938. From Greenock to the Firth of Clyde In the mid 1850s the steamer connections on the River Clyde assumed ever increasing importance, and journey transit times from settlements in Argyll and the islands to Glasgow became critical. The inconvenient situation of the Greenock station and pier encouraged thoughts of more convenient routes, and in 1862 the Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway was authorised. It was an independent company intending to provide a fast connection from Rothesay, Bute; it opened on 13 May 1865 and in August 1893 it amalgamated with the Caledonian Railway, having been operated by the Caledonian Railway since its opening.Awdry, p. 78 In 1889 the Caledonian itself opened an extension line from Greenock to Gourock, more conveniently situated than Greenock; this involved the expensive construction of Newton Street Tunnel, the longest in Scotland.Chris Hogg and Lynn Patrick, The Glasgow, Cowal and Bute Route Through Time, Amberley Publishing, Stroud, 2014, In competing with rival rail and steamer connections, the Caledonian became frustrated with its reliance on independent steamer operators, and tried to obtain powers to operate the vessels directly; this was refused by Parliament on competition grounds, and in reaction the company founded the nominally independent Caledonian Steam Packet Company in 1889. The CSPC expanded its routes and services considerably; following nationalisation of the railways in 1948 it became owned by British Railways, but was divested in 1968 and later became a constituent of Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd, which is (2015) state-owned.[Calmac corporate web page at https://www.calmac.co.uk/corporate/history] Glasgow and Paisley suburban lines In the final decades of the nineteenth century, as the cities spread into conurbations, the company's attention turned to increasing traffic in areas now thought of as \\"suburban\\". Street running tramways were already responding to the demand for passenger travel in these areas, but as yet they used horse traction. The Cathcart District Railway was promoted as an independent concern but heavily supported by the Caledonian. It opened in 1886 from Pollokshields to Mount Florida and Cathcart (the eastern arm of the present-day Cathcart Circle Line) in 1886, and was extended via Shawlands to form a loop in 1894. It was worked by the Caledonian, although the company retained its independence until 1923. The Glasgow Central Railway was authorised as an independent company to build a surface line from Rutherglen to Maryhill. It encountered fierce opposition, and the scheme was taken over by the Caledonian and converted into a route mainly in tunnel. It opened in 1896, further encouraging suburban passenger travel. It closed in 1959 but re- opened (as the Argyle Line) in 1979. The Paisley and Barrhead District Railway was incorporated in 1897 and transferred to the Caledonian in 1902; it was to link Paisley and Barrhead and enable a circular service from Glasgow. The line was substantially ready in 1902 but by now street tramways were electrically operated and eminently successful. It was plain that a passenger service would not be viable against tram competition and the intended passenger service was never started.Awdry North Clydeside The area of the north bank of the river Clyde became increasingly important for industry, and therefore became heavily populated. The North British Railway and its satellites had gained an early monopoly of this traffic, but its importance encouraged the Caledonian to enter the area. The Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway was nominally independent, running from near Maryhill to Dumbarton, opening progressively between 1894 and 1896. In 1896 the Caledonian gained access to Loch Lomond with the opening of the Dumbarton and Balloch Joint Railway, (originally built by the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway), built jointly with the NBR. The Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway In 1888 the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway opened a line from Giffen on the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway to Ardrossan. Its purpose was to shorten the route for Caledonian mineral traffic, and it was worked by the Caledonian. In 1903–04 it was extended eastwards to Cathcart and Newton, enabling the heavy mineral trains to avoid the Joint Line and the congested area around Gushetfaulds from the Lanarkshire coalfields to Ardrossan Harbour.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways: Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, , pp. 91 to 92 Edinburgh and Lothians Caledonian lines are shown in red on this 1905 Railway Clearing House map of Edinburgh. The Caledonian Railway entered Edinburgh from Carstairs on 15 February 1848; its terminus was a one-platform station named Lothian Road. This was the first line to offer travel without change of carriage between Edinburgh and England: passengers on the rival North British Railway needed to cross the River Tweed on foot to continue their rail journey. The unsatisfactory Edinburgh terminus needed improvement but funds were limited, and the Caledonian built a short spur to Haymarket; talks had taken place about using the E&GR; and NBR station, later named Waverley; but the NBR rejected the idea. Eventually in 1870 the Lothian Road station was much improved and extended, and the new terminus was named Princes Street. An empty stock train for Princes Street Station, passing Dalry Road Locomotive Depot in 1962The owner of Granton Harbour encouraged, and half- funded, the construction of a branch from near Lothian Road, and this opened in 1861. A branch from the Granton line to Leith Docks was made in 1864. This line was opened to passengers from 1879: the Leith terminal was later renamed Leith North. After 1900 the port authorities built new modern docks to the east of the former Leith docks, and the Caledonian further extended its Leith line to reach the new facilities: the Leith New Lines opened in 1903. It had been planned to open a passenger service on the line, and passenger stations had been built, but street tramcar competition made it clear that an inner suburban passenger railway was unviable and the passenger service was never inaugurated. The Edinburgh main line passed close to numerous mineral workings, and several short branches and connections were made to collieries, iron workings and shale oil plants. The Wilsontown branch from Auchengray, opened in 1860 was the most significant, and carried a passenger service. The original Wishaw and Coltness Railway, now leased by the Caledonian, had long since reached Cleland ironworks from the west, and in 1869 the line was extended from near there to Midcalder Junction on the Edinburgh main line, passing through Shotts, Fauldhouse and Midcalder. This line connected to many further mines and industrial sites, and gave the Caledonian a passenger route between Glasgow and Edinburgh that competed with the North British Railway's route through Falkirk. The first main line had by-passed a considerable centre of industry located on the Water of Leith south-west of the city, and a branch line to Balerno opened on 1 August 1874. The line was successful in encouraging residential building, especially at Colinton, and also leisure excursions: for a time it was known as the picnic line, but it too succumbed to more convenient transport facilities by road, and it closed to passengers in 1943. Speculative residential development encouraged the construction of a line to Barnton, west of Edinburgh. The branch line opened on 1 March 1894; the terminus was named Cramond Brig at first. The Caledonian intended to make the line into a loop, returning to the city by way of Corstorphine, but this idea was shelved. Stirling, Perth, Callander and Crieff The Caledonian Railway had intended to lease, or absorb, the Scottish Central Railway (SCR), which obtained its Act of Parliament on the same day as the Caledonian. The SCR needed a partner railway to get access to Glasgow and Edinburgh, but the rival Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&GR;) would provide that. The SCR opened from Greenhill Junction with the E&GR; to Perth on 22 May 1848, and the Caledonian opened its branch to reach Greenhill Junction on 7 August 1848. The SCR remained independent for some time, mainly because of Parliamentary opposition to proposed mergers. The SCR built Perth General station, which became the focus of several railways at that traffic centre, and a Joint Committee managed the station. The SCR itself managed to absorb some local railways; the Crieff Junction Railway had opened from Crieff to what later became Gleneagles station in 1856, and it was worked by the SCR and absorbed in 1865. In 1858 the Dunblane, Doune and Callander Railway was opened in 1858. It achieved considerable significance as the starting point for the Callander and Oban Railway, described below. It was absorbed by the SCR in 1865 immediately before the SCR amalgamated with the Caledonian Railway on 1 August 1865, finally having gained Parliamentary approval to do so. The Scottish Central Railway was absorbed by the Caledonian Railway in 1865. North and east of Perth Several railways obtained their Acts of Parliament on the same day as the Caledonian, on 31 July 1845. There was a frenzy of railway promotion in that year, and it seemed as if every locality must have its own line. The Scottish Central Railway had been described above; the Scottish Midland Junction Railway (SMJR), the Aberdeen Railway and the Dundee and Perth Railway also got their Acts on the same day. The SMJR built a line from Perth to Forfar; at Perth it used the Scottish Central Railway joint station. The main line ran through the fertile area of Strathmore and the SMJR adopted two existing short lines that were on a suitable alignment. They were the Newtyle and Coupar Angus Railway and the Newtyle and Glammiss Railway. (Glammiss is spelt Glamis nowadays.) Both were unsuccessful adjuncts to the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, built using stone block sleepers and a track gauge of . The two short lines were modernised and altered to double track using standard gauge. At Forfar the SMJR joined the Arbroath and Forfar Railway, another earlier stone block railway, in this case using the track gauge of . The SMJR opened in 1848. The Inchture Express was a horse-drawn carriage service operated by the Caledonian Railway Company. Its rails \\"ran along a hedge-lined route\\" to Inchture railway station. It later closed and the rails were lifted.\\"‘Soldiering On’ ……… and Magdalene\\" - Westmuir.org.uk The Aberdeen Railway was to run north from Guthrie, a few miles north-west of Arbroath. Joining the Arbroath and Forfar Railway there, it obtained access to both termini of that line. It was authorised to lease the A&FR.; The Aberdeen Railway may have underestimated the cost of upgrading the A&FR;'s stone block track, and it ran out of money building its own main line; its construction was delayed and it encountered political difficulty in Aberdeen itself. It opened in 1850 to Ferryhill, on the southern margin of the city, extending to Guild Street station in 1854. There were branches to Brechin and Montrose. At this early stage the Caledonian Railway saw itself as the future creator of an extensive network in Scotland, and it set about gaining control of as many other railways as possible. It did so not by purchasing them, but by leasing them. This had the advantage that no payment was required at first, only a periodical payment much later. The Caledonian negotiated with the SCR, the SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway and believed it had captured them, but the SCR had other ideas. Much later the Caledonian found that the periodical lease payments were unaffordable, and it was rescued by the legal opinion that the lease agreements had been ultra vires. The Dundee and Perth Railway opened in 1847; it was taken over by the Scottish Central Railway, and its network came to the Caledonian with the SCR when that company was taken over by the Caledonian in 1865. The Scottish Midland Junction Railway opened in 1848 from Perth to Forfar, giving onward access to Aberdeen. The SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway amalgamated in 1856 to form the Scottish North Eastern Railway in 1856. The SNER did not remain independent for long: it was absorbed by the Caledonian in 1866. At the time of the absorption the SNER and the Great North of Scotland Railway were engaged in building a through line at Aberdeen, with a new Joint station; it opened in 1867. The Caledonian had now got what it had wanted from the outset: control of an extensive network of lines covering a considerable territorial area. This came at a cost: Parliament became increasingly uncomfortable with monopolies of this kind, and when the North British Railway protested, it was given running powers over much of the Caledonian's northern system. There was worse to come: as the North British approached Dundee (with the building of the Tay Bridge, which opened in 1878, the NBR sought and was given joint ownership of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, which became jointly owned in 1881. The NBR had already built an independent line from Arbroath to Kinnaber Junction, north of Montrose, and so, with the opening in 1890 of the Forth Bridge immediately north of Edinburgh, now had a rival route to Aberdeen. Competition between the companies on the east and west coast routes from London to Aberdeen led in 1895 to what the press called the Race to the North. Acquisition of the SNER and other lines brought a number of branch lines to communities off the main line. A number of infill lines were added towards the end of the nineteenth century. The Dundee and Forfar direct line was opened by the Caledonian in 1870 between Broughty Ferry and Forfar, developing residential travel (to Dundee) but otherwise only a rural line. The Forfar and Brechin Railway was promoted as a potential alternative main line; it opened in 1895 but remained simply a rural branch. Callander and Oban Railway The Callander and Oban Railway was an independent company intended to connect the Western Seas to the railway network, but it had been promised financial support by the Scottish Central Railway (SCR). The Caledonian absorbed the SCR in 1865 and the directors were dismayed at the level of commitment to a difficult construction scheme barely started. Construction took many years, reaching a \\"Killin\\" station in 1870 and completing in 1880, and money was always desperately tight. The line was never profitable although it contributed greatly to the development of the town of Oban. A branch was built to Ballachulish, opened in 1903. The western part of the line from Crianlarich is open today, connected to the West Highland Line but the remainder has closed.John Thomas, The Callander and Oban Railway, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1966John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15: North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, The Strathearn Lines The Perth, Almond Valley and Methven Railway opened in 1858 to connect Methven to the SMJR network; it was extended to Crieff when the Crieff & Methven Railway opened in 1866. Crieff now had two railway connections, using the same station. The upsurge in tourism in Strathearn encouraged many visitors, who used Crieff as a railhead and continued by road. In 1893 the Crieff and Comrie Railway made a short extension into Strathearn, and this encouraged ideas of completing a link right through to the Callander and Oban line. There were wild dreams of Irish cattle imports coming to Perth markets over the route. This became the Lochearnhead, St Fillans and Comrie Railway; due to serious problems raising capital, it took from 1901 to 1905 to open fully. The through traffic never developed and passenger connections at Balquhidder were poor, discouraging through travel.Bernard Byrom, The Railways of Upper Strathearn, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2004, Notable accidents Quintinshill *On 2 October 1872, an express passenger train was in collision with a freight train that was being shunted at , Dumfriesshire due to errors by the station master and signalman, compounded by a lack of interlocking and absolute block working.

Above there was a crest showing helmet surmounted by a crown; the supporters were unicorns. This was slightly modified in August 1866 and from September 1888 a further riband was added below the motto; this bore the words Caledonian Railway Company. From the base of the shield hung a medallion of St Andrew. A lion sejant affronted was superimposed on the crest above which was the inscription In Defence [sic].

She was the third ship to carry the name. Construction The third Quincy was authorized on 17 June 1940, and laid down at the Fore River Shipyard of the Bethlehem Steel Company, Quincy, Massachusetts, as St. Paul on 9 October 1941. Renamed Quincy on 16 October 1942, to perpetuate that name, after the destruction of the second at the Battle of Savo Island on 9 August 1942. She was launched on 23 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Catherine Adams-Morgan, wife of Henry S. Morgan, daughter of Charles Francis Adams, and sponsor of the previous Quincy. She was commissioned at the U.S. Naval Drydock, South Boston, Massachusetts, on 15 December 1943, with Captain Elliot M. Senn in command. Service history World War II After a shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Paria, between Trinidad and Venezuela, the new heavy cruiser was assigned, 27 March 1944, to Task Force 22 and trained in Casco Bay, Maine, until she steamed to Belfast, Northern Ireland, with TG 27.10, arriving 14 May and reporting to Commander, 12th Fleet for duty. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force, accompanied by Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk, inspected the ship's company in Belfast Lough 15 May 1944. USS Quincy sailed out of Belfast Lough, 20 May, for the Clyde and anchored off Greenock, Scotland, to begin special training in shore bombardment. She then returned to Belfast Lough, and began final preparations for the invasion of Europe. Her float plane artillery observer pilots were temporarily assigned to VOS-7 flying Spitfires from RNAS Lee-on- Solent (HMS Daedalus). At 0537, 6 June 1944, she engaged shore batteries from her station on the right flank of Utah Beach, Baie de la Seine. During the period 6 through 17 June, in conjunction with shore fire control parties and aircraft spotters, Quincy conducted highly accurate pinpoint firing against enemy mobile batteries and concentrations of tanks, trucks, and troops. She also neutralized and destroyed heavy, long range enemy batteries, supported minesweepers operating under enemy fire, engaged enemy batteries that were firing on the crews of the ships USS Corry (DD-463) and Glennon (DD-620) during their efforts to abandon their ships after they had struck mines and participated in the reduction of the town of Quinéville on 12 June. Quincy steamed to Portland, England, 21 June, and joined TF 129. She departed Portland, 24 June, for Cherbourg, France. The bombardment of the batteries surrounding the city commenced in conjunction with the Army's assault at 1207. Nineteen of the twenty-one primary targets assigned the task force were successfully neutralized or destroyed thus enabling Army troops to occupy the city on 26 June. The heavy cruiser sailed for Mers-el Kebir, North Africa, on 4 July, arriving there 10 July. She proceeded to Palermo, Sicily, 16 July, arriving two days later. Quincy, based at Palermo through 26 July, conducted shore bombardment practice at Camarota in the Gulf of Policastro. She then steamed to Malta via the Straits of Messina. Between 27 July and 13 August, the cruiser participated in training exercises at Malta and Camarota, Italy. On the afternoon of 13 August, in company with four British cruisers, one French cruiser, and four American destroyers, Quincy departed Malta for the landings on the southern coast of France, arriving Baie de Cavalaire 15 August. For three days the group provided fire support on the left flank of the U.S. 7th Army. Quincy transferred 19 August to TG 86.4, and until the 24th, engaged the heavy batteries at Toulon, St. Mandrier, and Cape Sicie. She steamed westward the afternoon of 24 August to support minesweepers clearing the channel to Port de Bouc in the Marseilles area. USS Quincy was detached from European duty on 1 September, and steamed for Boston, arriving one week later. She remained at Boston for the installation of new equipment through 31 October, when she got underway for training in Casco Bay. After fitting out at Boston for a Presidential cruise, Quincy steamed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, 16 November. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his party embarked on Quincy on 23 January 1945, at Newport News, Virginia, for passage to Malta, arriving 2 February. After receiving calls by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and other dignitaries, President Roosevelt departed Quincy and continued on to the Crimea by air to attend the Yalta Conference. The Quincy Agreement President Roosevelt with Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia and William Leahy aboard Quincy USS Quincy departed Malta 6 February 1945, and arrived at the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal two days later, after calling at Ismalia, Egypt. The President and his party returned to Quincy on 12 February, following the Yalta Conference with Soviet leader Josef Stalin and Churchill, and the next day received King Farouk of Egypt and Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia. From 14 February, President Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, known in the West as Ibn Saud, met aboard Quincy. During the meeting, President Roosevelt tried to persuade Ibn Saud to give support for Jewish immigration to Palestine, and hoped that Ibn Saud might be able to offer constructive advice on the Palestine issue. There, Roosevelt and Saud concluded a secret agreement in which the U.S. would provide Saudi Arabia military security – military assistance, training and a military base at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia – in exchange for secure access to supplies of oil.Letter From President Roosevelt to King Ibn Saud, April 5, 1945, Crethi Plethi. After a call at Alexandria, and a final meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, Quincy steamed for Algiers, arriving on 18 February. Following a presidential conference with the American ambassadors to Great Britain, France and Italy, the cruiser steamed for the United States, arriving Newport News, 27 February. Remainder of Wartime Career USS Quincy sailed out of Hampton Roads 5 March 1945, arriving Pearl Harbor 20 March. After training in the Pearl Harbor area, she steamed for Ulithi via Eniwetok, joining the 5th Fleet there 11 April. Two days later, she departed Ulithi and joined Rear Admiral Wiltse's Cruiser Division 10, in Vice Admiral Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force. From 16 April, Quincy supported the carriers in their strikes on Okinawa, Amami Gunto, and Minami Daito Shima. She returned to Ulithi with units of the task force 30 April. In company with units of TF 58, Quincy departed Ulithi 9 May, for the area east of Kyushu, Japan, arriving 12 May for carrier strikes against Amami Gunto and Kyushu. Before dawn on 14 May, the cruiser splashed a Japanese plane. Her own aircraft strafed targets in Omonawa on Tokune Shima 19 May. Quincy continued to support carrier aircraft strikes against Okinawa, Tokuno Shima, Kikai Jima, Amami Gunto, and Asumi Gunto until the force returned to base 13 June. En route, Quincy safely rode out the severe typhoon of 5 June. During the period of replenishment and upkeep at Leyte in the Philippines, Rear Admiral Wiltse, ComCruDiv 10 transferred to Quincy. The cruiser departed Leyte 1 July with Task Force 38 to begin a period of strikes at Japan's home islands which lasted until the termination of hostilities on V-J Day. She supported carriers in strikes in the Tokyo Plains area, Honshu, Hokkaido, and Shikoku. Quincy joined the Support Force, 23 August, and four days later, helped occupy Sagami Wan, Japan, and entered Tokyo Bay 1 September. Rear Admiral Wiltse transferred his flag 17 September to Vicksburg (CL-86), and 20 September, Quincy joined the 5th Fleet as a unit of the Eastern Japan Force, TF 53, basing in Tokyo Bay. Korean War Quincy was decommissioned on 19 October 1946, in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. She was assigned to the Bremerton Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet until 31 January 1952, when she recommissioned to serve in the 7th Fleet in support of United Nations Forces in Korea. Following fitting out and readiness training, she served in the screen of the Fast Carrier Task groups ranging off the coastline of Korea from 25 July 1953 to 1 December 1953. She again decommissioned 2 July 1954, at Bremerton. Fate Quincy sat in the reserve fleet at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard until she was stricken on 1 October 1973. She was the only one of her class to retain her Bofors 40 mm gun mounts instead of receiving the newer 3/50 mounts. Of the Baltimore class she had the second shortest active career (Fall River was in service just 2 1/2 years), and only was in active service for 5 1/2 years. She was sold to American Ship Dismantling Co., Portland Oregon on 1 September 1974 for $1,156,667.66.

It served a triangular area of south-west Scotland between Glasgow, Stranraer and Carlisle. It was formed on 28 October 1850 by the merger of two earlier railways, the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway and the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway. Already established in Ayrshire, it consolidated its position there and extended southwards, eventually reaching Stranraer. Its main business was mineral traffic, especially coal, and passengers, but its more southerly territory was very thinly populated and local traffic, passenger and goods, was limited, while operationally parts of its network were difficult. It later formed an alliance with the English Midland Railway and ran express passenger trains from Glasgow to London with that company, in competition with the Caledonian Railway and its English partner, who had an easier route. In 1923 the G&SWR; formed a constituent of the London Midland and Scottish Railway group. Much of the network remains active at the present day; Glasgow commuting particularly has developed, and parts of the network have been electrified. Many of the earlier mineral workings, and branches constructed to serve them, have ceased, and many local passenger stations in rural areas have closed. In 1921 the G&SWR; had of line (calculated as single track extent plus sidings) and the company’s capital was about £19 million. History Before the G&SWR; In the early 1830s, there were already several mineral railways operating in Scotland; local in extent, they were mostly built to serve coal mines and other mineral activity. The successful operation of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway as an inter- city line, and then the Grand Junction Railway reaching northwards, caused railway promoters in the west of Scotland to consider that one day, there might be a through railway line to London. The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;) was authorised in 1838, and opened its line to Ayr in 1840. It was a locomotive railway, and in due time it opened its branch line from Dalry to Kilmarnock, with the intention of extending to Carlisle to meet up with whatever railway might reach that city from the south. The GPK&AR; had anticipated constructing its authorised line and then the extension, but by 1846 there was a frenzy of competing schemes that threatened to destroy the Company's core business. Few of these were realistic, but the GPK&AR; itself felt obliged to promote numerous branches, many of them tactical, in order to keep competing schemes out. This period of railway promotion was followed by a slump, when money was difficult to come by, and these factors prevented the GPK&AR; from bringing its Carlisle extension into reality. Enthusiasm for a connection to English railways continued, however, and was intensified by the promotion of other schemes to link central Scotland and England. Interests friendly to the GPK&AR; formed the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway (GD&CR;) to extend from the southern extremity of the GPK&AR; to Carlisle; their route became known as the Nithsdale Route. Opposing promoters put forward a so-called central line via Carstairs and Beattock, that had the advantage of a shorter mileage, and the capacity to serve Edinburgh directly, but the disadvantage of much heavier gradients and running through a less populous area. This route became known as the Annandale Route. The GD&CR; was authorised by Act of Parliament, but the rival Caledonian Railway (CR) had already had authorisation for building its line on the Annandale route; the GD&CR;'s financial position led it to abandon its intention of building an independent line to Carlisle, and it altered its plan so as to join the CR at Gretna Junction, relying on negotiating running powers for its trains to reach Carlisle. The GD&CR; and the GPK&AR; formed the definite intention of merging; at first the GD&CR; demanded terms that were excessive, particularly as their own financial situation was weak: they were funding construction of their line with money loaned by the GPK&AR.; However more realistic expectations emerged later, and by Acts of 1846 and 1847 it was determined that the two companies would merge when the GD&CR; had completed construction of its line. The GPK&AR; extended as far as Horsecleugh (between Cumnock and New Cumnock) and the GD&CR; reached an end-on junction there, completing the through line on 28 October 1850.David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2104, The G&SWR; formed System map of the G&SWR; at vesting in 1850Accordingly on 28 October 1850 the G&SWR; was formed.Stephenson Locomotive Society, The Glasgow and South Western Railway, 1850 - 1923, 1950 Although this was described as a merger, the reality was that the penniless GD&CR; was dissolved, its operation was taken over by the GPK&AR;, and the latter company changed its name to the G&SWR.; The GPK&AR; had been working the GD&CR;'s line for it since it (partially) opened. The new company had lines: * from Bridge Street in Glasgow to Ayr; the Ayr station was north of the river, at Newton- on-Ayr), and the section between Bridge Street and Paisley was owned and operated jointly with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway; and * from Dalry Junction to Gretna Junction via Kilmarnock and Dumfries; and * a number of lines in mineral districts, including the former Kilmarnock and Troon Railway, now upgraded to contemporary technical standards. The trains on the Dumfries line now ran through to Carlisle, an arrangement having been made with the Caledonian Railway to permit this. However the CR did not encourage the G&SWR; and only on 1 March 1851 was a booking clerk given accommodation at Carlisle Citadel passenger station. This was granted on an undertaking that the G&SWR; would never interfere with the business of the CR or the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, and tolls were charged for use of the line from Gretna, and for bulk goods passing through Carlisle, whether transshipped or not. The CR ensured that all traffic between south of Carlisle and Glasgow or Edinburgh was routed over its own line. The accounts for the first half year, produced in March 1851, showed gross income for the six months to be £87,186 and a 2¼% dividend was declared. The Company owned 72 engines, 171 passenger coaches, and 2,416 non-passenger vehicles. Good enough as the results were, the long main line to Gretna was not producing much, due to the dominance of competing route of the Caledonian Railway, and business in general declined following the first half year. A pooling agreement was finalised in 1853 which mitigated some of the worst toll charges, but routing of goods traffic via the CR was made obligatory in many situations. The agreement included a comprehensive limitation on encroachment by either railway into the other's territory.Campbell Highet, The Glasgow & South-Western Railway, Oakwood Press, Lingfield, 1965 Expansion by alliance Dumfries station pilot in BR daysIn the years immediately following the formation of the G&SWR;, the shortage of capital meant that no definite steps were taken for further expansion. Local initiatives were encouraged, however, with the G&SWR; providing some funding and in most cases working the line when it was completed. The Ayr and Dalmellington Railway Act was passed on 4 August 1853. At this time the G&SWR; Ayr station was north of the River Ayr, and the A&DR; was to run from Falkland Junction, a short distance north of the station, and round the east side of the town. The new line had an Ayr passenger station (a temporary structure at first), but it was less convenient than the old terminus; until January 1860 the old G&SWR; terminus station continued to be used by some trains. There were important ironworks owned by the Houldsworth family, and ironstone and coal deposits, in the lands near Dalmellington. The independent A&DR; company was worked by the G&SWR; and later absorbed on 1 August 1858. On 10 July 1854 the Ayr and Maybole Junction Railway was authorised to reach Maybole by a junction from the Ayr and Dalmellington; the junction was to be called Maybole Junction, but was named Dalrymple Junction when the line opened to goods traffic on 15 May 1856. Passenger opening was delayed until 2 August 1856 because of the Board of Trade Inspecting Officer's dissatisfaction with the works at first. This line too was worked by the G&SWR.; There were discussions of a further extension railway to reach Girvan and develop the harbour there, possibly as a ferry port for Ireland: a Maybole and Girvan Railway was formed in 1855; it got its authorising Act on 14 July 1856. All of these local initiatives received the promise of cash support from the G&SWR.; The Maybole and Girvan line opened on 24 May 1860; the old Maybole station, east of Redbrae, was unsuitable for an onward route and was by- passed, the new passenger station being at Culzean Road. The Ardrossan Railway had long been allied to the G&SWR; and by Act of 24 July 1854 it was vested in the G&SWR;, effective on 1 August 1854. The line ran between Ardrossan Harbour and Kilwinning, with mineral branches extending further east. Reaching towards the north of Ireland thumbThe wide space of countryside west of Dumfries and south of Girvan still lacked any rail connection. In 1856 a provisional Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway (CD&DR;) was gaining momentum. It was independently sponsored, although it was seen as a possible first step in opening up the entire region; it was authorised on 21 July 1856. This prompted the G&SWR; to relocate the Dumfries station to a point north of St Mary's street; the former \\"temporary\\" station was relegated to goods status. The new station opened on 13 September 1859: it was described as \\"equal if not superior in lightness and beauty to any in Great Britain\\".Glasgow Herald (newspaper), 27 September 1859, quoted in Ross The CD&DR; line opened on 21 July 1856.The SLS says 7 November. For many years schemes had been put forward to reach Portpatrick. There was a small harbour there and ferry crossings to Donaghadee provided the shortest route to reach the north of Ireland. Mail, cattle, and soldiers had been conveyed that way, but reaching Portpatrick with a railway across difficult and sparsely populated land had been a challenge. Encouraged by the CD&DR; authorisation, at the end of 1856 promoters resolved to build a British and Irish Grand Junction Railway, 62 miles (100 km) from Castle Douglas. Government assurances were given about the use of the sea route for mail and improvement of the tiny harbour at Portpatrick, and suddenly rival railways including the English Great Northern Railway were hastening to put up money for a share. With a capital of £460,000, the line looked well supported and got its Act of Parliament on 17 August 1857, retitled the Portpatrick Railway.C E J Fryer, The Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Railways, The Oakwood Press, Headington, 1991, The construction, through difficult terrain, went ahead, and as completion became near, the Portpatrick Railway planned the arrangements for the working of its line. The G&SWR; were working the CD&DR; and offered to work the Portpatrick line for 72% of gross receipts. The G&SWR; had recently announced that it worked its own railway for less than 38%, and the Portpatrick line decided the proposed charge was too much; on 28 March 1860 they decided that \\"the board should retain the working of the line under their own management\\". The G&SWR; had been certain that its terms for working the line would have to be accepted; it had promised a further £40,000 towards the capital cost of the Portpatrick Railway, and on a pretext it now declined to make that payment, further alienating the Portpatrick Railway. The line opened, stoutly independent, on 12 March 1861 as far as Stranraer. The Government had implied a promise to improve the tiny harbour at Portpatrick and was now delaying; the Portpatrick Railway delayed too, but finally completed the line from Stranraer to Portpatrick on 28 August 1862. Although some use was made of the route, the anticipated major sea crossing never materialised, and in time Stranraer became the more important port.David L Smith, The Little Railways of South West Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, H D Thorne, Rails to Portpatrick, T Stephenson and Sons Ltd, Prescot, 1976, The Paisley and Renfrew line Before the existence of the G&SWR;, its predecessor, the GPK&AR; had acquired the Paisley and Renfrew Railway, a horse-operated railway with track on stone blocks, and the GS&WR; acquired this line. By 1866 the primitive technology had become an embarrassment and pressure from the Burgh of Renfrew caused the G&SWR; to upgrade the line to locomotive haulage, converting it to standard gauge, and connecting it to the main (joint) line at Greenlaw, east of Paisley, and facing Glasgow. The work was completed by September 1867 and through passenger trains between Glasgow and Renfrew were instituted. Crossing the Clyde, and a central Glasgow station System map of the G&SWR; 1876As traffic increased, dependency on the Bridge Street station as the G&SWR; Glasgow station became ever more strained, and a nominally independent central terminus was proposed; this would involve constructive the first railway bridge over this part of the Clyde—there had previously been no connection across the river in Glasgow. The G&SWR; and the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway were partners, and invited the Caledonian Railway to join in, but the CR declined. The City of Glasgow Union Railway obtained Parliamentary authorisation on 29 July 1864; the capital was £900,000 with the G&SWR; and the E&GR; taking one-third of the shares each.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 (The following year the two existing companies agree to take all the stock themselves.) The line would run from a junction with the Paisley joint line at West StreetLater referred to as Eglinton Street Junction, and later still merged with Shields Junction. to Sighthill on the E&GR;, with a new passenger station at St Enoch, a large goods station in land vacated by the University of Glasgow and a connection at West Street to the General Terminus goods branch on the bank of the Clyde. Construction was slow and costs overran heavily; on 12 December 1870 the first trains ran from Shields Road to a temporary central passenger terminus at Dunlop Street. On 1 June 1871 the line was extended to Bellgrove, joining the North British Railway (NBR) there, and forming the north-south connecting link, which was heavily used for transfer goods trains. It was not until 1 May 1876 that St Enoch station opened and through trains to London ran from there. The station was universally regarded as magnificent, and in 1879 the accompanying St Enoch Hotel, the largest in Scotland, opened too. By now the NBR enthusiasm for a general central passenger station had waned, and the northwards exit from St Enoch station was only used by local G&SWR; trains to Springburn. On 29 June 1883 the station and the immediate approach lines were transferred from the CGUR to the G&SWR.; This was followed by partition of the CGUR; the section south and west of College Junction (near High Street, NBR) went to the G&SWR;, and the section north and east of Bellgrove went to the NBR. These changes were enacted on 29 June 1883. In the 1890s it became obvious that expansion of St Enoch was essential, and on 18 August 1898 an Act for the extension of St Enoch station was passed. A second arch roof and six further platforms were built; they were brought into use progressively from 1901. The extension was completed in 1904, at a cost of £2,500,000. A direct line to Kilmarnock The GPK&AR; had declined to give Kilmarnock a direct route; it opened its line via Dalry in 1843. In 1848 the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway (GB&NDR;) opened from a South Side terminus in Glasgow. The line was friendly to the Caledonian Railway. In 1865 both the Caledonian Railway and the G&SWR; obtained Parliamentary authority to build a line from Glasgow to Kilmarnock. Shareholders of both companies objected to the wasteful duplication, and in 1869 an Act was obtained for the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway, owned jointly by both companies, running from Neilston on the GB&NDR.; It opened in 1873, with a branch from Lugton to Beith. A connection into the St Enoch line was opened shortly afterwards. Other new lines proposed, and existing branches absorbed As well as supporting the City Union line, in 1864 the G&SWR; proposed a large number of branch lines, most of them tactical in respect of competition with the Caledonian Railway. This caused considerable disquiet among shareholders—the same was true within the Caledonian company—and some moderation of the proposals took place. As part of the rapprochement, the G&SWR; was granted permanent powers to run between Gretna and Carlisle, for £5,000 a year. In 1865, four railways were absorbed, effective from 1 August; they were the Bridge of Weir Railway (from Elderslie, opened in 1864), the Maybole and Girvan Railway (described above; it had never made money and had run out of cash to finish the buildings and ancillary works on the line); the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway (CD&DR;); and the Kirkcudbright Railway. The CD&DR; and the Kirkcudbright Railway were now operated as the Kirkcudbright branch as a single unit from Dumfries. The Caledonian Railway was granted running powers between Dumfries and Castle Douglas for trains it ran between Lockerbie and Stranraer. Reaching Greenock The Prince's Pier, Greenock, in use today as a shipping terminusFrom the outset, Greenock had been served by the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway, allied to the Caledonian Railway. The port developed and carried increasing volumes of goods, and passenger traffic for the Clyde ferries grew considerably. The G&SWR; wished to secure a share of this valuable traffic, and the Bridge of Weir Railway had been a move in that direction. The friendly Greenock and Ayrshire Railway (G&AR;) was heavily supported (£300,000 out of £350,000 share capital) by the G&SWR;, and opened its line from Bridge of Weir to its Albert Harbour station at Greenock, in 1869. This gave a quayside transfer to steamers at Greenock, and a price war with the established CR line broke out, eventually resolved with a traffic sharing agreement: the G&SWR; received 42.68% of receipts. In 1872 the G&AR; was absorbed by the G&SWR.; The Greenock Harbour Trustees further developed Albert Harbour, constructing Princes Pier with extensive berthing facilities for steamers, and the G&SWR; renamed their own station Princes Pier in 1875. Further extension to the harbour facilities took place at the eastern side of Greenock, at Garvel. The G&SWR; built a connecting line eastwards from Lynedoch, opening on 5 August 1886. G&SWR; trains had to reverse twice to reach the harbour on a steep incline. The branch cost £262,467. The Annbank lines In 1870 and the following years, a network of lines was opened connecting Ayr with mineral-bearing districts in east Ayrshire. The first line was from Ayr to Mauchline through Annbank, and this was followed by a long loop from Annbank to Cronberry on the Muirkirk line, and a connection to Holehouse Junction on the Dalmellington route. Although the Mauchline connection facilitated some passenger journeys, mineral traffic was more important than passenger operation on these lines. Extending to Largs Ardrossan had long been reached, but the G&SWR; wished to extend up the coast to Largs. It experienced resistance at first, the Largs Branch opened in stages between 1878 and 1885, with stations at West Kilbride, Fairlie and Largs. A Fairlie Pier station was opened: the station roof was built using materials recovered from the temporary Dunlop Street station. Bitter and destructive competition for the ferry traffic to island locations developed. Portpatrick again—or Stranraer The G&SWR; had reached Girvan in 1860 with the help of allied local companies. Continuing from Girvan to Portpatrick, for the crossing to the north of Ireland was still an aspiration, but this section was the most difficult, and sparsely populated terrain. After some false starts, friendly promoters put forward a Girvan and Portpatrick Junction Railway (G&PJR;) obtained an authorising Act on 5 July 1865 to close the gap. Raising money, and carrying out the construction was much more difficult than expected. The railway was to reach Stranraer by joining the Portpatrick Railway at Challoch Junction, continuing over that line for 10 miles (16 km). However the Portpatrick line was being worked by the Caledonian Railway (CR), and the CR was hostile to the G&PJR;, which it saw was an ally of the G&SWR.; It took until 5 October 1877 to inaugurate a full passenger service over the line. In the intervening period the supposed advantages of Portpatrick as the ferry port for the north of Ireland had dissipated, and Stranraer was now considered the better port. The G&PJR; was financially exhausted and weak, operating a long main line with little local business. The financial situation worsened and the company was taken over by the Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Railway Company (A&WR;) on 1 August 1887. The new ownership appears to have been a speculative move, but the A&WR; was no more solvent than its predecessor. In 1892 the G&SWR; purchased the company for £270,000 (on 20 June). It introduced corridor coaching stock was on the boat trains in 1899. The Portpatrick Railway (PR) had its established line from Dumfries to Stranraer, also a long line through difficult terrain with little intermediate business, but achieving significantly better financial results. The arrangement with the CR for that company to work the line expired in 1885 and the PR considered who might take up the work. Both the CR and the G&SWR; were candidates, and two English railways, the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway were interested in extending their influence to Stranraer to capture Irish business. The Wigtownshire Railway was in effect a branch of the PR, running south from Newton Stewart to connect good quality farming land around Wigtown and the sea ports of Garlieston and Wigtown. Their line was being worked by an independent contractor, Thomas Wheatley and his son. After considerable negotiation, the decision emerged not to form a further working arrangement for the PR, but instead to merge the PR and the Wigtownshire Railway. The combined network formed the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway, purchased by a consortium of the interested larger companies, the G&SWR;, the CR, the MR and the LNWR. The arrangement was ratified on 6 August 1885; the sale value was £491,980. The line was worked by the G&SWR; and the CR in tandem. Paisley Canal, and the Dalry and North Johnstone line As traffic developed, especially the mix of heavy mineral traffic and passenger trains, line capacity became increasingly a problem. This was particularly the case on the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Line where the traffic of the rival Caledonian Railway had to be dealt with. In 1881 the G&SWR; submitted a Parliamentary Bill to drain the defunct Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal and build a railway on it. The Bill passed, and the G&SWR; started work on what became the Paisley Canal Line. The new line left the former City of Glasgow Union Line at Shields Junction, where it joined the Joint Line, and ran via the southern part of Paisley to Elderslie, where it rejoined the Ayr main line. At this time Paisley was enjoying very considerable industrial growth and the new line was able to serve the relevant areas. Following the route of a contour canal involved many meandering curves, the worst of which were eased by the use of earthworks. The line opened fully on 1 July 1885, and some through passenger trains used the line as well as local and mineral trains. Capitalising on access to industry in Paisley, a spur off the Canal Line to Potterhill was opened in 1886. In 1894-5, new carriage sidings were constructed at Bellahouston on the Canal Line, while new engine sheds at Corkerhill were constructed, to relieve pressure on the city centre accommodation. Industry was expanding too in Johnstone, on the north side of the town in areas not served by the main line. As well as mineral extractive industries, there were extensive textile mills along the Black Cart Water, and a short branch line from Cart Junction to Johnstone North was opened in 1896. The traffic congestion problem was also experienced on the main line between Elderslie and Dalry (where the Kilmarnock line diverged) and the decision was taken to duplicate this section of the route by a new line on the north of the lochs in the Garnock Valley. The scheme upgraded the Johnstone North line, and ran from its terminus (upgraded and relocated) to Brownhill Junction, north of Dalry, by way of Lochwinnoch. This was the Dalry and North Johnstone Line, which opened in 1905. The capacity relief was continued at Dalry by quadrupling the track from Brownhill Junction, and the junction itself was a flying junction, the first in Scotland. Much more traffic took the diverging route at Elderslie towards Cart Junction—all of the new line traffic, as well as the fast Greenock boat trains—and the opportunity was taken to provide a burrowing junction at Elderslie for this route: when the Ayr main line was built, it crossed the canal by a bridge. The canal was long defunct, and a new line was built passing under the bridge and running to Cart Junction, eliminating the conflicting move. This opened in 1906. Darvel In 1896 the Newmilns branch was extended to Darvel. When the Caledonian Railway reached the town from the east in 1905, a non-encroachment agreement was activated and a few miles of line from Darvel to the Lanarkshire county boundary was transferred from the CR to the G&SWR.; There was an end-on connection at the county line. The volume of mineral traffic heading for Troon and Ayr caused congestion in passing through Kilmarnock station, and a by-pass line on the south side of the town opened in 1902. These developments are described in the article Cross-country lines of the Glasgow and South Western Railway. Linking Paisley and Barrhead Observing the success of the Paisley Canal and Potterhill lines in serving industry, both the CR and the G&SWR; considered lines in the area between Paisley and Barrhead. In 1902 the G&SWR; opened the Barrhead Branch from Potterhill to a new Barrhead Central station, with spurs to the GB&KJR; route. For a time a circular passenger service was operated from St Enoch via Paisley Canal, Potterhill and Barrhead Central. Usage proved disappointing, and it reverted to a reduced conventional service in 1907, and Barrhead Central closed to passengers in 1917. Three local lines after 1900 The small industrial town of Catrine had long aspired to a railway connection. Possibly responding to a petition, the G&SWR; built a short branch from Brackenhill Junction, south of Mauchline. The Catrine branch opened on 1 September 1903, with a train service operated by a railmotor. In 1905 the Cairn Valley Light Railway opened, connecting Moniaive with the G&SWR; main line just north of Dumfries. It adopted a proprietary signalling system based on Sykes lock and block system. Passenger usage was poor and was hit hard by bus competition, and the line closed to passengers in 1943. On 17 May 1906 the Maidens and Dunure Light Railway opened. Intended to open up remote coastal settlements between Ayr and Girvan it was promoted with the construction of the luxurious Turnberry Hotel. Through trains from Glasgow were run, and in both World Wars military use was made of the line. Local passenger services were discontinued in 1930, but the link at the Girvan end to Turnberry survived for a short period; at the Ayr end a holiday camp was in use, receiving holidaymakers by train to Heads of Ayr until 1968.David McConnell and Stuart Rankin, Rails to Turnberry and Heads of Ayr: The Maidens & Dunure Light Railway & the Butlin's Branch, The Oakwood Press, Usk, 2010, Gordon Stansfield, Ayrshire and Renfrewshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing Ltd, Catrine, 1999, Operations Brakes In the earliest days, railways did not have continuous brakes (in which brakes on all or most vehicles in a train could be controlled by the driver). Over the course of time, accidents created pressure for their provision on passenger trains, but the system to be adopted was controversial. At first the company adopted Smith's simple vacuum brake, but although the equipment was simple, it had the defect that it was inoperable in the event of a train becoming divided, or if the engine apparatus failed. The company decided to change systems: at the end of 1878 the Board of Trade were informed that the G&SWR; had six engines operating Smith's brake, and 22 engines operating the Westinghouse brake. The Westinghouse system was much more complicated, but it was an automatic brake. In this period there was considerable disparity in the systems used on the railways of the country, and compatibility between locomotive and the vehicles of another company, for example on through trains, was a serious issue. The company began to see its future as an ally of the Midland Railway, a large English system using the automatic vacuum brake, and in 1884 decided to convert to that system. There was a lengthy transition period during which compatibility with other companies' rolling stock was a problem.David L Smith, Tales of the Glasgow and South Western Railway, Ian Allan Limited, London, undated, page 20 By the end of 1900 the company had 210 engines fitted with continuous brake equipment, and 97% of passenger mileage was under such conditions. 2,021,266 train miles were run with the automatic vacuum brake, and 69,160 with Westinghouse.Ross, pages 102 to 103, 142 and 188 Slip coach Between 1888 and 1901 the G&SWR; operated a slip coach service. The slip coach section was slipped at Irvine off the 4.15 pm St Enoch to Ayr, which ran non-stop from Paisley to Prestwick. The slip section was attached to an Ardrossan to Ayr stopping train, with which it followed the main train. Six-wheel brake vans with end windows were built for the service.Ross, page 123 Signalling Swan, writing for the G&SWRA;, described early concentration of signalling and primitive interlocking at Dumfries: > In 1859 the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway formed a junction at > Dumfries, and at the request of the G&SWR; built a brick \\"lighthouse\\" or > octagonal signalbox at Albany Junction. It opened with two wooden masts > built into the castellated telegraph hut, the tallest for running up and > down a flag to signify if the main line north to St Enoch was clear and the > second one slightly shorter to signal the trains for the Castle Douglas > branch. > With the opening of the Lockerbie branch into Dumfries in 1863 the > pointsman's tower was removed from the junction beyond Albany Place and was > re-erected on the summit of the slope at the deep cutting north of Dumfries > station. The Castle Douglas and Lockerbie railways formed junctions with the > G&SWR; line in the cutting opposite the pointsman's tower. > The Kirkcudbright Advertizer (sic) further reported: The points at the > sidings and junctions will be worked from the top of this bank by means of > rods and levers. Three semaphore signal posts have been erected at the > tower; the central post, which is higher than the others, is for the G&SWR; > line; that on the eastern side, for the Lockerbie line; and the one on the > western side, for the Castle Douglas line. The semaphores for each line will > be connected with the levers which work the points, and consequently when > the pointsman shifts the points the semaphore is made by the same movement > to show the proper signal ... In the night the signals will be by lamp > lighted with wax lights.Andrew F Swan, G&SWR; Signalling, G&SWR; > Association, Paisley, 1999, Shipping Serving many piers and harbours on the Firth of Clyde it was natural that the G&SWR; developed shipping services to the islands and other piers. This traffic increased considerably in the 1870s and excursion traffic also became significant. Closures In the 1960s consideration was given to rationalising the railway facilities in Glasgow, and it was decided to concentrate the south-facing passenger services on Glasgow Central station, closing St Enoch. The closure took place in 1966, and for some time the trainshed was used principally as a car park; the roof was demolished in 1975. The site was redeveloped as the St Enoch Centre, which was opened in May 1989. A stub of the G&SWR; route relaid at Kilmarnock for coal traffic in 2010 The Greenock line was shortened to operate only between Elderslie and Kilmacolm in 1966. In 1971 the Princes Pier stub was connected to the Wemyss Bay line at Cartsburn Junction in order to serve the Clyde Port Authority container terminal. In June 1965 the Port Road between Dumfries and Challoch Junction was closed; Stranraer boat trains were diverted via Mauchline. In 1966 local services were withdrawn from the Dalry to Kilmarnock line; the route closed completely in October 1973 after completion of the West Coast Main Line electrification. The Paisley Canal Line was closed in January 1983, and the original Paisley Canal station, on the east side of Causeyside Street, was converted into a restaurant. In the 1980s and 1990s the course of the line beyond Paisley was made into a footpath and cycle path. This links Lady Octavia Park in Greenock, through upper Port Glasgow, Kilmacolm and past Quarrier's Village to Paisley. It is part of the Sustrans National Cycle Route linking Edinburgh and Gourock. The G&SWR; network today The main line of the G&SWR;, from Glasgow to Carlisle via Kilmarnock and Dumfries continues to operate at the present day. The line from Glasgow to Stranraer via Ayr also continues in use, together with the branch from Kilwinning to Largs. After a period of closure the Paisley Canal line reopened, operating only between Shields Junction and Paisley Canal. Passenger services are supported by the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport.

Reilly collaborated with Anderson on other films, playing a pornographic actor in Boogie Nights (1997); a deeply religious police officer in Magnolia (1999); and a cameo in the music video for Fiona Apple's single \\"Across the Universe\\". Terrence Malick's ensemble war film, The Thin Red Line (1998) featured Reilly in a supporting role that was written as a larger one, but much of his scenes were deleted along with many other cast members. In 1999, Reilly starred in the independent film The Settlement alongside William Fichtner, which Variety writer Robert Koehler dismissed as a \\"write-off\\" despite praising his performance. That same year, Reilly played one of the newspaper managing editors in the romantic comedy film Never Been Kissed. In Sam Raimi's sports drama For Love of the Game, released the same year, Reilly played fictional baseball catcher Gus Sinski. The box office hit The Perfect Storm was his only release of 2000 and featured Reilly as a veteran crew member on the Andrea Gail fishing vessel which was caught in the 1991 Perfect Storm. In the Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming directed comedy The Anniversary Party (2001), he played director Mac Forsyth.

He was one of his few friends.\\" He played the lead role in the crime film Criminal (2004), with Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Based on the Argentine film Nine Queens (2000), Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt that \\"John C. Reilly may be one of our finer character actors, but his portrayal of Richard Gaddis, a gimlet-eyed con man, in Criminal allows too many vestiges of the duped schlub of a husband he played in Chicago to leak into his performance.\\" Reilly reportedly quit the 2005 Lars von Trier film Manderlay to protest the on-set killing of a donkey. He played the lead in one of Miranda July's short films, Are You the Favorite Person of Anybody? (2005).

Reilly appeared in the 2017 monster film reboot Kong: Skull Island, as Hank Marlow, a World War II lieutenant who has spent 28 years stranded on the titular island. The actor, who described his character as \\"essentially a love-letter to Chicago\\", was singled out for praise for his performance out of what is generally considered to be an underwhelming ensemble cast. Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz noted that Reilly \\"steals the film instantly and never gives it back\\" in playing the \\"wisecracking castaway\\", and Owen Gleiberman praised his performance for being \\"terrifically dry and sly\\" in what could have been a cliché character.

Plot summary The story of BPS revolves around a \\"freelance artist\\" named Akira Shirase. He's a very talented, yet mysterious computer programmer. Because of his incredible abilities, he's contacted by several individuals (curiously, all of them are very similar persons named Akizuki Kaoru) to do all sorts of strange computer-related hacking/security jobs. He's a very quiet guy who lives alone in a small apartment near his niece's house. At first, the episodes revolved around some freelance jobs that highlighted his abilities - however, later on in the series, characters came back and offered help or plot twists. The school that Shirase had gone to had been hinted throughout the series, and it finally made an appearance in the last episode, when some of the characters began to show their hidden relationships to the others. However, the series was not continued. Characters ; : : He's the main character of the story. Akira is a very talented computer connoisseur and is known in the hacking world as Battle Programmer Shirase (which is typically shortened to BPS). A genius in computer hacking and security who can do anything on any computer, or phone. ; : : Misao is Akira's great-niece. She is a very shy girl who loves to spend her time with Akira, whom she often refers to as '. She cares for him deeply and it's very common to see her cooking for him or worrying about him. Sometimes, Misao says ', which doesn't have an actual meaning (this may be a \\"cute\\" form of speech the creators added for her to please fans of cute anime girls). Misao looks very young for a 6th grader. Misao Amano has made a cameo appearance in the final OVA of (Dual!

She had been following Misao and asked if she could go to her house. She seems to have the same knowledge of computers as Akira and in one episode asks him to join her in the National Guard as her partner. She also asks him to go to America with her, and seems to have strong feelings for Akira as well. ; : : Sae is Misao's teacher. In an earlier episode she had tried to get Misao together with a boy from grade class. She is later seen drinking in an alley where she meets Akira, whom she hasn't seen since high school.

While it was obsolete by the start of the Second World War and unsuited to the European air war, the Wellesley was operated in the desert theatres of East Africa, Egypt and the Middle East. It was one of two planes named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the other being the Vickers Wellington. Design and development geodesic construction in duralumin The design originated from the Air Ministry Specification G.4/31 which called for a general purpose aircraft, capable of carrying out level bombing, army co-operation, dive bombing, reconnaissance, casualty evacuation and torpedo bombing. The biplane Vickers Type 253 design, which used a radical geodesic airframe construction, derived from that used by Barnes Wallis in the airship R100, was ordered by the Ministry and tested against the specification along with the Fairey G.4/31, Westland PV-7, Handley Page HP.47, Armstrong Whitworth A.W.19, Blackburn B-7, Hawker P.V.4 and the Parnall G.4/31. The Type 253 was declared the winner, with 150 being ordered. The Vickers Type 246 monoplane, which used the same geodetic design principles for the fuselage and wings, was then built as a private venture, first flown at Brooklands by Vickers' Chief Test Pilot J \\"Mutt\\" Summers, on 19 June 1935 and offered to the RAF.Mason 1994, p. 237. This aircraft had superior performance but did not attempt to meet the multi-role requirements of the specification, being designed as a bomber only. An initial order for 96 Type 246s was substituted for the Type 253 order. The RAF ultimately ordered a total of 176 with the service name \\"Wellesley\\", to a newly written specification 22/35, with a 14-month production run starting in March 1937.Crosby 2007, p. 145. The Wellesley was a single-engine monoplane with a very high 8.83 aspect ratio wing and a manually operated, retractable undercarriage. As it was not known how the geodetic structure could cope with being disrupted by a bomb bay, the Wellesley's bomb load was carried in two streamlined panniers under the wings.Mason 1994, pp. 237–238. The Wellesley Mk I had two cockpits but this was slightly changed in what was unofficially dubbed the Wellesley Mk II, whose pilot's canopy was extended to cover the navigator/bomb aimer's position that had been buried in the fuselage. Only the pilot had flight controls. The gunner retained a separate canopy. Operational history 47 Squadron RAF (as can be seen by the code letters 'KU') over the desert The RAF received its first Wellesleys in April 1937: they served with No. 76 Squadron RAF at Finningley. The aircraft eventually equipped six RAF Bomber Command squadrons in the UK. Five aircraft with provisions for three crew members were modified for long-range work with the RAF Long-Range Development Flight. Additional modifications included the fitting of Pegasus XXII engines and extra fuel tanks. On 5 November 1938, three of these aircraft under command of Squadron Leader Richard Kellett flew non-stop for two days from Ismailia, Egypt to Darwin, Australia setting a world distance record. All three aircraft broke the record, but No. 2 aircraft landed in West Timor, short of the objective. The Wellesley's record remained unbroken until November 1945.Barfield 1973, p. 89. This flight is still the longest by an aircraft with a single piston engine.Murray 2009 By the outbreak of the Second World War, the Wellesley had been phased out from home-based squadrons, with only four examples remaining in Britain, but they remained in service with three squadrons based in the Middle East.Air International July 1980, p. 33. Following the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the remaining Wellesley squadrons participated in the East African Campaign against Italian forces in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somaliland. Although obsolete, the Wellesley formed a major part of the British Commonwealth bomber forces, mainly carrying out raids targeting Eritrea and northern Ethiopia. Sudan-based Wellesleys carried out their first bombing mission on 11 June 1940, against Asmara in Eritrea. Three days later, they were involved in their first air combat, when Capitano Mario Visintini, future top-scoring biplane ace of the Second World War, intercepted a pair of Wellesleys from 14 Squadron on their way to bomb Massawa. Visintini, who was flying a Fiat CR.42, shot down the aircraft K7743, flown by Pilot Officer Reginald Patrick Blenner Plunkett. It was the first of Visintini's 16 air victories in Eastern Africa.Sutherland & Canwell 2009, p. 32.Skulski 2007, p. 40. In the early part of the campaign, fighter escort was not available and when caught by CR.42s, Wellesleys proved vulnerable to the Italian biplane fighter. Despite this, the Wellesley continued to be sent on bombing raids, bombing Addis Ababa from Aden on 18 August.Air International July 1980, p. 49. The Wellesley continued in use against the Italians over East Africa until November 1941, when Gondar, the last Italian-held town, fell to Commonwealth and Ethiopian forces. The final Wellesley-equipped unit, 47 Squadron, was then switched to maritime reconnaissance duties over the Red Sea, continuing in this role until September 1942.Air International July 1980, p. 50. While the Wellesley was not a significant combat aircraft, the design principles that were tested in its construction were put to good use with the Wellington medium bomber, which became one of the mainstays of Bomber Command in the early years of the European war. In February 1940, three Wellesleys (K7728, K7735 and K8531) were sold to Egypt to serve in the Royal Egyptian Air Force.Barfield 1973, p. 93.

She was the first warship to be named for the city of Reno, Nevada. was a destroyer named for Lt. Commander Walter E. Reno. Reno was laid down by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, at San Francisco, California, on 1 August 1941. She was launched on 23 December 1942; sponsored by Mrs. August C. Frohlich; and commissioned on 28 December 1943, with Captain Ralph C. Alexander in command. The USS Reno spent her entire service life in the Pacific War, and its immediate aftermath, during 1944 through 1946. Service history Shakedown Following a shakedown cruise off the coast of San Diego, the USS Reno departed from San Francisco on 14 April 1944, steaming west to join the 5th Fleet, under the command of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. As an active unit in Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force (Task Force 58), Reno first came in contact with the enemy while supporting minor air raids against Marcus Island on 19–20 May. Three days later, she also supported air strikes on Japanese-held Wake Island. Battle of the Philippine Sea During the months of June to July 1944, Reno joined the fast aircraft carriers in air attacks against Saipan on 11 June, Pagan Island on 12–13 June, and against the Volcano Islands and the Bonin Islands - namely Iwo Jima, Haha Jima, and Chichi Jima on 15–16 June. Three days later, Reno aided in repelling a large-scale Japanese Navy aircraft carrier task force attempt to defeat the American invasion of the Marianas Islands (including Guam, Saipan, and Tinian, during the Battle of the Philippine Sea \\\\- the world's largest carrier vs. carrier battle of all time, and an overwhelming victory by the U.S. Navy. Guam From 20 June to 8 July 1944, Reno joined operations covering the conquest of Saipan. She then covered amphibious landings on Guam from 17–24 July, and two days later, she took part in air strikes against the Palau Islands from 26–29 July. The 5th Fleet then became the 3rd Fleet, as Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., rotated in to command this fleet. Doubling back northward again, one more series of air strikes were made on the Bonin Islands on 4–5 August. Then on 7 September, TF 38 (formerly TF 58) returned south to hit the Palaus again. Philippines After steaming west across the Philippine Sea, Reno and TF 38 carried out some of the first American air raids against the Philippines hitting the southern island of Mindanao, and its adjacent islands, from 9–13 September 1944. TF 58 supported the amphibious landings on two of the Palau's from 15–20 September, and then on 21–22 September, it carried out air strikes against the Manila area of Luzon in the northern Philippines. While striking the island of Nansei Shoto on 8 October, Reno and TF 38 came closer to the Japanese Home Islands than any other major units of the U.S. Navy had been during World War II. During a 3-day series of air strikes by TF 38 on Japanese airfields on the previously-touched island of Formosa from 12–14 October 1944, Reno shot down at least six enemy aircraft. At the height of this aerial battle, one Imperial Japanese Navy torpedo plane crashed Reno's fantail, exploding and partially incapacitating turret #6, but the turret officer in charge succeeded in maintaining his defensive fire against the attacking Japanese planes. USS Princeton On 24 October 1944, four days after the amphibious invasion of Leyte, while supporting air strikes against Japanese airfields on Luzon, TF 38 was subjected to a large- scale air attack by land-based aircraft from Clark Field, Luzon. The light aircraft carrier took the brunt of the attack; she was hit by an aerial bomb and forced to withdraw from the Task Force. Reno was assigned to help fight fires on board Princeton by bringing her fire hoses to bear, and also to rescue her crewmen. Reno closed Princeton five times but could not remain on station because of intense heat and smoke from the burning carrier. While Reno was assisting Princeton, the carrier began listing and her flight deck struck Reno, crushing one of her 40 mm mounts. Efforts to save the aircraft carrier continued, but when Princetons torpedo warhead magazine exploded, Reno was ordered to sink Princeton with her own torpedoes. Princeton was the last major US Navy aircraft carrier sunk by an enemy attack. On 25 October, having rejoined TF 38, Reno and the other warships steamed northward to engage the Japanese Northern Force, setting off the Battle off Cape Engaño, which was the final engagement of the Battle for Leyte Gulf. I-41 attack On the night of 3 November 1944, well east of the San Bernardino Strait, as part of Admiral Sherman's Task Group 3 (TG 38.3) of Task Force (TF 38) Fast Carrier Task Force, Reno received two torpedo hits on her port side fired from while escorting . One torpedo lodged in the outer hull of Reno and was later defused. The second hit exploded four decks below topside. This was the first time in almost two years that a Japanese submarine successfully attacked a ship operating with fast carriers. Casualties were 46 dead and many injured. After a night dead in the water, she survived yet another attempt to sink her by an unknown Japanese submarine firing 3 torpedoes that missed, but was rescued by a destroyer left behind to defend her. Reno was towed 1,500 miles (2,400 km) to the major American base at Ulithi Atoll for some temporary repairs by fleet tug . Among other measures taken to reduce topweight, her starboard torpedo tubes were jettisoned to help preserve stability in the damaged state. During this 700-mile voyage, a crew of 242 remained aboard. A total of 1250 tons of seawater was pumped from flooded compartments, a feat noted favorably by Vice Admiral Charles McMorris in his November 1944 endorsement of Reno's report on the torpedoing. Gunnery officer Arthur R. Gralla received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his role leading the dewatering effort in difficult conditions. Repairs in Charleston, South Carolina She then steamed under her own power across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal, then to Charleston, S.C., where she entered Charleston Navy Yard on 22 March 1945 for heavy repairs. Emerging seven months later, Reno was ordered to the Texas coast, then back to Charleston for the addition of hundreds of bunk spaces. She then reported for \\"Operation Magic Carpet,\\" steaming roundtrip twice to Le Havre, France bringing home U.S. Army troops. Decommission In early 1946, Reno steamed to Port Angeles, Washington, where she decommissioned on 4 November 1946, and then entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet, berthed at Bremerton, Washington. Reclassified CLAA-96 18 March 1949, she remained at Bremerton until her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 March 1959. Her hulk was sold on 22 March 1962 to the Coal Export Co., of New York City, for scrapping. One of Reno's 5-inch gun turrets was kept for display at the U.S. Navy Museum, in eastern Washington, D.C.. The ship's bell and flag are on display in City Hall in Reno, Nevada. The flag was stolen by rioters in June 2020 but was returned anonymously. Awards Reno earned three battle stars for World War II service.

Commissioned in 1949, she served in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Pacific before being decommissioned in 1958. She was sold for scrap in 1972. Construction and Commissioning Roanoke was laid down on 15 May 1945 by the New York Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, New Jersey; launched 16 June 1947; sponsored by Miss Julia Ann Henebry; and commissioned at Philadelphia 4 April 1949. Service Following shakedown in the Caribbean, Roanoke undertook maneuvers in the Atlantic as a unit of the Battleship-Cruiser Force and on 6 January 1950 got underway to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean for her first extended deployment. Returning to the United States in May, she alternated 6th Fleet deployments with operations in the western Atlantic until the summer of 1952 when she added a midshipman's cruise to Europe and the Caribbean to her schedule. Continuing to operate in the Battleship-Cruiser Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet until the fall of 1955, Roanoke completed her sixth Mediterranean deployment in May, then prepared for transfer to the Pacific Fleet. On 22 September 1955, Roanoke departed Norfolk, Va., for the Panama Canal.

Herbert Eisenhart, wife of the president of Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., Rochester, New York; and commissioned 20 December 1946 at the Boston Navy Yard, Captain Harry Aloysius Guthrie in command. Rochester departed Provincetown, Mass., 22 February 1947 for shakedown out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. By the end of April, she was at Philadelphia, ready to commence nine extended naval reserve training cruises which took her north to Casco Bay and south to the Caribbean. 1940s Upon completion of her ninth reserve training cruise in the second week of January 1948, Rochester prepared for Mediterranean service. Departing Philadelphia 20 February, she arrived at Gibraltar 1 March, and became flagship for Admiral Forrest Sherman, Commander, 6th Fleet. In addition to calling at several ports, the cruiser waited out the events of the Palestinian crisis, at Suda Bay on the northern coast of Crete. She completed her tour 14 June; Admiral Sherman shifted his flag to light cruiser Fargo (CL-106), and Rochester departed for Philadelphia the 15th, arriving 27 June. Rochester then resumed reserve training duty, making cruises to Bermuda, to New Brunswick, and to Jamaica. After shore bombardment exercises at Bloodsworth Island in early October 1948, Rochester reported to the South Boston Naval Shipyard for her first overhaul which included removal of her catapults and conversion of her aviation section from seaplanes to helicopters. Her new aviation detachment consisted of four Sikorsky HO3S-1 utility helicopters. The helos replaced the seaplanes formerly carried aboard. She then operated in the Caribbean and along the North Atlantic coast until she stood out from Narragansett Bay on 5 January 1950 and steamed for the west coast, and a new homeport, Long Beach, California. Transfer to Pacific In April 1950, Rochester departed Long Beach for the South Pacific. After calling at Pearl Harbor, she embarked Adm. Arthur W. Radford, Commander-in Chief, Pacific Fleet, for a tour of the U.S. Trust Territories. Upon completion of this tour, Vice Admiral A. D. Struble, Commander, 7th Fleet, was received on board at Guam. Rochester then set course for the Philippine Islands. Korean War Service She was at Sangley Point, Philippine Islands, when president Truman ordered the 7th Fleet into action, and was operating with Carrier Task Force 77 on the morning of 3 July 1950 when the first U.N. air raids against North Korean forces were launched. On 18 and 19 July 1950, Rochester supported landings on Pohang Dong by the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. She continued to serve with Task Force 77 until 25 August 1950. Vice Admiral Struble's flagship, commanded by Capt. Edward L. Woodyard, Rochester's guns provided support for the troops that landed at Inchon on 13 September in the operation that prompted General MacArthur’s proud signal that \\"the Navy and Marines have never shone more brightly than this morning.\\" Just before daylight at 0550 on 17 September, a North Korean Yak-9 and an II-2 made an attack run on the cruiser Rochester, anchored off Wolmi-do. Initially the aircraft were thought to be friendly until they dropped four bombs over the American ship. All but one missed and the one that did hit smashed the Rochesters crane and failed to detonate. There were no American casualties in the skirmish and they painted a Purple Heart on the crane as a reminder of how close the ship came to being heavily damaged. After the bombing of the Rochester, she and the nearby cruiser HMS Jamaica opened fire with naval guns. The North Korean II-2 then strafed the British cruiser, resulting in one sailor killed and two wounded. At about the same time, shots from the Jamaica hit the II-2 and it crashed into the water. It became the first and only shootdown of an attacking plane with naval gunfire. The Yak-9 fled after losing its partner. During the months of October, November, and December, Rochester operated continuously along the Korean coast for 81 days, providing gunfire support to troops ashore and serving as a mobile helicopter base. Helos were kept aloft constantly to aid the minesweepers in opening the ports of Changjon, Koje, Wonsan, Hungnam, and Songjin. In addition to destroying six mines by her own gunfire, the cruiser controlled naval air operations in the Wonsan area during the 10 days preceding the arrival of landing forces. Her helicopters also aided in the rescue of survivors from the minesweepers Pirate (AM-275) and Pledge (AM-277), sunk in Wonsan Harbor. During 198 days of operations against the Communist forces in Korea, she steamed over 25,000 miles and expended 3,265 eight-inch and 2,339 five-inch projectiles. Rochester then called at Sasebo, Japan, and on 10 January 1951 headed for home, arriving at Long Beach 30 January. Ten days later she steamed for her scheduled yard overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, San Francisco, which took her through May. During refresher training in the Long Beach-San Diego area, Rochester assisted in training crews for the ships that were being taken out of mothballs. She departed Long Beach 27 August 1951 for training in the Hawaiian area, after which she steamed for Yokosuka, Japan, arriving there 21 November. On 28 November, she blasted Kosong with more than 250 rounds of high explosive. She then ranged the entire northeastern Korean coastline, bombarding ground targets, while her helicopters flew rescue missions for Task Force 77 aviators. Into the spring she continued harassment and interdiction missions along the eastern coast of Korea. In early April 1952, she spent a week as flagship of the Blockading and Escorting Forces on Korea's west coast, and in late April, she steamed for her homeport. May through October was given over to in-port time at Long Beach and to coastal training operations. In November, the cruiser departed for another WestPac tour, arriving back on station as a unit of Task Group 77.1 (Support Group) in the waters off eastern Korea 7 December. After spending the winter months in harassment and interdiction missions and other operations with the fast carrier task force, Rochester steamed home, arriving Long Beach, 6 April 1953. Post-Korean War and fate During her regularly scheduled yard period at Mare Island, 4 May to 7 September 1953, her 20 mm. and 40 mm. batteries were replaced with 3 inch/50 rapid-fire guns. Coastal refresher training was followed by a 5 January 1954 departure for Western Pacific (WestPac). The normal exercises and port calls of a WestPac deployment ended with her departure from Yokosuka 29 May for the west coast. USS Rochester in 1956. In February 1955, Rochester served on her fifth WestPac deployment, completing that cruise 6 August and arriving at her homeport the 22d. An overhaul at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard commenced 19 November 1955 and was completed 7 March 1956. Thence came refresher training and preparations for yet another WestPac deployment. This sixth Pacific tour commenced 29 May when Rochester and her escorts stood out of Long Beach. It was 16 December when the ships returned to homeport. The first week of June 1957 found Rochester in San Francisco, where she acted as flagship for Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz as he reviewed the 1st Fleet. Returning to Long Beach the 18th, she resumed local operations and exercises until her departure on 3 September for her seventh WestPac deployment. She returned to Long Beach 24 March 1958. Two more WestPac deployments followed, 6 January to 17 June 1959 and 5 April to 29 October 1960. While planning was in place to convert her into an Albany-class guided missile cruiser, funds were not appropriated and Rochester was ordered to report to the Commander, Bremerton Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet on 15 April 1961 for inactivation. She departed Long Beach 12 April, reported to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and she was placed out of commission, in reserve, 15 August 1961. She remained at Bremerton until struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1973 and sold to Zidell Explorations, Portland, Oregon on 31 July 1974 and scrapped.

It was originally started by the Transport Research Laboratory for the UK Department for Transport, but later backed by several European governments, as well as by the European Union. Their slogan is \\"For Safer Cars\\". History and Activities Euro NCAP is a voluntary vehicle safety rating system created by the Swedish Road Administration, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile and International Consumer Research & Testing, backed by 14 members, and motoring & consumer organisations in several EU country.They provide European consumers with information regarding the safety of passenger vehicles. In 1998, operations moved from London to Brussels. The programme is modelled after the New Car Assessment Program, introduced 1979 by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Other areas with similar (but not identical) programmes include Australia and New Zealand with ANCAP, Latin America with Latin NCAP and China with C-NCAP. They publish safety reports on new cars, and awards 'star ratings' based on the performance of the vehicles in a variety of crash tests, including front, side and pole impacts, and impacts with pedestrians. Testing is not mandatory, with vehicle models either being independently chosen by Euro NCAP or sponsored by the manufacturers. In Europe, new cars are certified as legal for sale under the Whole Vehicle Type Approval regimen that differs from Euro NCAP. According to Euro NCAP, \\"The frontal and side impact crash tests used by Euro NCAP are based on those used in European legislation. However, much higher performance requirements are used by Euro NCAP. Euro NCAP also states that \\"Legislation sets a minimum compulsory standard whilst Euro NCAP is concerned with best possible current practice. Progress with vehicle safety legislation can be slow, particularly as all EU Member States’ views have to be taken into account. Also, once in place, legislation provides no further incentive to improve, whereas Euro NCAP provides a continuing incentive by regularly enhancing its assessment procedures to stimulate further improvements in vehicle safety.\\" Before Euro NCAP was introduced car buyers had little information if one car was safer than the other; in fact the UK at the time required only a frontal crash test. The first ratings of a group of best selling vehicles were released in 1997, since then Euro NCAP has tested more than 1,800 new cars, published over 600 ratings and has helped save upwards of 78,000 lives in Europe and encouraged manufacturers to build safer cars. The result of Euro NCAP is that over the years, European automakers' cars have become much safer. Test results are commonly presented by motor press, and in turn, greatly influence consumer demand for a vehicle. One notable example of this is the Rover 100 (an update of a 1980 design, first marketed as an Austin ), which after receiving a one-star Adult Occupant Rating in the tests in 1997, suffered from poor sales and was withdrawn from production soon afterwards: it was the 'What Car' car of the year, for 1980. BMW's 2007 MINI, for example, had its bonnet and headlamp fixture changed to meet the latest pedestrian safety requirements. In 2017, to celebrate Euro NCAP's 20th anniversary, they tested a 1997 Rover 100 and 2017 Honda Jazz under the same frontal offset conditions to demonstrate how far safety has come in Europe.  2020 Test Procedures   Mobile progressive deformable barrier  The test car is propelled at into a moving deformable barrier mounted on an oncoming 1400 kg trolley, also travelling at 50 km/h at a 50% overlap. This represents hitting a mid-size family car. Two adult male THOR-50M dummies are seated in the front and two child dummies are placed in the back. The aim is to assess the crumple zones and the compatibility of the test car.  Full width rigid barrier  The test car is driven into a rigid barrier with full overlap at a speed of . A small female dummy is seated in the driving position and in the rear seat. The aim is to test the car's restraint system, such as airbags and seat belts.  Mobile side impact barrier  A deformable barrier is mounted on a trolley and is driven at into the side of the stationary test vehicle at a right angle. This is meant to represent another vehicle colliding with the side of a car.  Side pole  The car is propelled sideways at against a rigid, narrow pole at a small angle away from perpendicular to simulate a vehicle travelling sideways into roadside objects such as a tree or pole.  Far side impact  The body in white (frame) of the vehicle is attached to a sled is propelled sideways to provide accelerations experienced by the vehicle in the side and pole tests, but on the far side of the vehicle. The far side testing was implemented in 2020 to help combat far side injuries (where the driver is struck from the opposite side). The ‘excursion’ of the dummy - the extent to which the dummy moves towards the impacted side of the vehicle - is measured. If the vehicle is equipped with centre airbags then a co-driver (front passenger) is added in either the mobile side impact or the pole test to evaluate its effectiveness.  Whiplash  The vehicle seat is propelled forwards rapidly at both to test the seat and head restraint's capabilities to protect the head and neck against whiplash during a rear impact.

It was first published serially in the journal The Russian Messenger in 1868–69. The title is an ironic reference to the central character of the novel, Prince (Knyaz) Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin, a young man whose goodness, open-hearted simplicity and guilelessness lead many of the more worldly characters he encounters to mistakenly assume that he lacks intelligence and insight. In the character of Prince Myshkin, Dostoevsky set himself the task of depicting \\"the positively good and beautiful man.\\" The novel examines the consequences of placing such a unique individual at the centre of the conflicts, desires, passions and egoism of worldly society, both for the man himself and for those with whom he becomes involved. Joseph Frank describes The Idiot as \\"the most personal of all Dostoevsky's major works, the book in which he embodies his most intimate, cherished, and sacred convictions.\\" It includes descriptions of some of his most intense personal ordeals, such as epilepsy and mock execution, and explores moral, spiritual and philosophical themes consequent upon them. His primary motivation in writing the novel was to subject his own highest ideal, that of true Christian love, to the crucible of contemporary Russian society. The artistic method of conscientiously testing his central idea meant that the author could not always predict where the plot was going as he was writing. The novel has an awkward structure, and many critics have commented on its seemingly chaotic organization. According to Gary Saul Morson, \\"The Idiot violates every critical norm and yet somehow manages to achieve real greatness.\\" Dostoevsky himself was of the opinion that the experiment was not entirely successful, but the novel remained his favourite among his works. In a letter to Strakhov he wrote: \\"Much in the novel was written hurriedly, much is too diffuse and did not turn out well, but some of it did turn out well. I do not stand behind the novel, but I do stand behind the idea.\\" Background In September 1867, when Dostoevsky began work on what was to become The Idiot, he was living in Switzerland with his new wife Anna Grigoryevna, having left Russia in order to escape his creditors. They were living in extreme poverty, and constantly had to borrow money or pawn their possessions. They were evicted from their lodgings five times for non-payment of rent, and by the time the novel was finished in January 1869 they had moved between four different cities in Switzerland and Italy. During this time Dostoevsky periodically fell into the grip of his gambling addiction and lost what little money they had on the roulette tables. He was subject to regular and severe epileptic seizures, including one while Anna was going into labor with their daughter Sofia, delaying their ability to go for a midwife. The baby died aged only three months, and Dostoevsky blamed himself for the loss. Dostoevsky's notebooks of 1867 reveal deep uncertainty as to the direction he was taking with the novel. Detailed plot outlines and character sketches were made, but were quickly abandoned and replaced with new ones. In one early draft, the character who was to become Prince Myshkin is an evil man who commits a series of terrible crimes, including the rape of his adopted sister (Nastasya Filippovna), and who only arrives at goodness by way of his conversion through Christ. By the end of the year, however, a new premise had been firmly adopted. In a letter to Apollon Maykov, Dostoevsky explained that his own desperate circumstances had \\"forced\\" him to seize on an idea that he had considered for some time but had been afraid of, feeling himself to be artistically unready for it. This was the idea to \\"depict a completely beautiful human being\\". Rather than bring a man to goodness, he wanted to start with a man who was already a truly Christian soul, someone who is essentially innocent and deeply compassionate, and test him against the psychological, social and political complexities of the modern Russian world. It was not only a matter of how the good man responded to that world, but of how it responded to him. Devising a series of scandalous scenes, he would \\"examine each character's emotions and record what each would do in response to Myshkin and to the other characters.\\"Morson (2018). p. 5 The difficulty with this approach was that he himself did not know in advance how the characters were going to respond, and thus he was unable to pre-plan the plot or structure of the novel. Nonetheless, in January 1868 the first chapters of The Idiot were sent off to The Russian Messenger. Plot Part 1 Prince Myshkin, a young man in his mid-twenties and a descendant of one of the oldest Russian lines of nobility, is on a train to Saint Petersburg on a cold November morning. He is returning to Russia having spent the past four years in a Swiss clinic for treatment of a severe epileptic condition. On the journey, Myshkin meets a young man of the merchant class, Parfyon Semyonovich Rogozhin, and is struck by his passionate intensity, particularly in relation to a woman—the dazzling society beauty Nastasya Filippovna Barashkova—with whom he is obsessed. Rogozhin has just inherited a very large fortune due to the death of his father, and he intends to use it to pursue the object of his desire. Joining in their conversation is a civil servant named Lebedyev—a man with a profound knowledge of social trivia and gossip. Realizing who Rogozhin is, he firmly attaches himself to him. The purpose of Myshkin's trip is to make the acquaintance of his distant relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna, and to make inquiries about a matter of business. Lizaveta Prokofyevna is the wife of General Epanchin, a wealthy and respected man in his mid-fifties. When the Prince calls on them he meets Gavril Ardalionovich Ivolgin (Ganya), the General's assistant. The General and his business partner, the aristocrat Totsky, are seeking to arrange a marriage between Ganya and Nastasya Filippovna. Totsky had been the orphaned Nastasya Filippovna's childhood guardian, but he had taken advantage of his position to groom her for his own sexual gratification. As a grown woman, Nastasya Filippovna has developed an incisive and merciless insight into their relationship. Totsky, thinking the marriage might settle her and free him to pursue his desire for marriage with General Epanchin's eldest daughter, has promised 75,000 rubles. Nastasya Filippovna, suspicious of Ganya and aware that his family does not approve of her, has reserved her decision, but has promised to announce it that evening at her birthday soirée. Ganya and the General openly discuss the subject in front of Myshkin. Ganya shows him a photograph of her, and he is particularly struck by the dark beauty of her face. Myshkin makes the acquaintance of Lizaveta Prokofyevna and her three daughters—Alexandra, Adelaida and Aglaya. They are all very curious about him and not shy about expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor on a wide variety of subjects—his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speak of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly ostracized and morally condemned. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastasya Filippovna. The prince rents a room in the Ivolgin apartment, occupied by Ganya's family and another lodger called Ferdyschenko. There is much angst within Ganya's family about the proposed marriage, which is regarded, particularly by his mother and sister (Varya), as shameful. Just as a quarrel on the subject is reaching a peak of tension, Nastasya Filippovna herself arrives to pay a visit to her potential new family. Shocked and embarrassed, Ganya succeeds in introducing her, but when she bursts into a prolonged fit of laughter at the look on his face, his expression transforms into one of murderous hatred. The Prince intervenes to calm him down, and Ganya's rage is diverted toward him in a violent gesture. The tension is not eased by the entrance of Ganya's father, General Ivolgin, a drunkard with a tendency to tell elaborate lies. Nastasya Filippovna flirtatiously encourages the General and then mocks him. Ganya's humiliation is compounded by the arrival of Rogozhin, accompanied by a rowdy crowd of drunks and rogues, Lebedyev among them. Rogozhin openly starts bidding for Nastasya Filippovna, ending with an offer of a hundred thousand rubles. With the scene assuming increasingly scandalous proportions, Varya angrily demands that someone remove the \\"shameless woman\\". Ganya seizes his sister's arm, and she responds, to Nastasya Filippovna's delight, by spitting in his face. He is about to strike her when the Prince again intervenes, and Ganya slaps him violently in the face. Everyone is deeply shocked, including Nastasya Filippovna, and she struggles to maintain her mocking aloofness as the others seek to comfort the Prince. Myshkin admonishes her and tells her it is not who she really is. She apologizes to Ganya's mother and leaves, telling Ganya to be sure to come to her birthday party that evening. Rogozhin and his retinue go off to raise the 100,000 rubles. Among the guests at the party are Totsky, General Epanchin, Ganya, his friend Ptitsyn (Varya's fiancé), and Ferdyshchenko, who, with Nastasya Filippovna's approval, plays the role of cynical buffoon. With the help of Ganya's younger brother Kolya, the Prince arrives, uninvited. To enliven the party, Ferdyshchenko suggests a game where everyone must recount the story of the worst thing they have ever done. Others are shocked at the proposal, but Nastasya Filippovna is enthusiastic. When it comes to Totsky's turn he tells a long but innocuous anecdote from the distant past. Disgusted, Nastasya Filippovna turns to Myshkin and demands his advice on whether or not to marry Ganya. Myshkin advises her not to, and Nastasya Filippovna, to the dismay of Totsky, General Epanchin and Ganya, firmly announces that she is following this advice. At this point, Rogozhin and his followers arrive with the promised 100,000 rubles. Nastasya Filipovna is preparing to leave with him, exploiting the scandalous scene to humiliate Totsky, when Myshkin himself offers to marry her. He speaks gently and sincerely, and in response to incredulous queries about what they will live on, produces a document indicating that he will soon be receiving a large inheritance. Though surprised and deeply touched, Nastasya Filipovna, after throwing the 100,000 rubles in the fire and telling Ganya they are his if he wants to get them out, chooses to leave with Rogozhin. Myshkin follows them. Part 2 For the next six months, Nastasya Filippovna remains unsettled and is torn between Myshkin and Rogozhin. Myshkin is tormented by her suffering, and Rogozhin is tormented by her love for Myshkin and her disdain for his own claims on her. Returning to Petersburg, the Prince visits Rogozhin's house. Myshkin becomes increasingly horrified at Rogozhin's attitude to her. Rogozhin confesses to beating her in a jealous rage and raises the possibility of cutting her throat. Despite the tension between them, they part as friends, with Rogozhin even making a gesture of concession. But the Prince remains troubled and for the next few hours he wanders the streets, immersed in intense contemplation. He suspects that Rogozhin is watching him and returns to his hotel where Rogozhin—who has been hiding in the stairway—attacks him with a knife. At the same moment, the Prince is struck down by a violent epileptic seizure, and Rogozhin flees in a panic. Recovering, Myshkin joins Lebedyev (from whom he is renting a dacha) in the summer resort town Pavlovsk. He knows that Nastasya Filippovna is in Pavlovsk and that Lebedyev is aware of her movements and plans. The Epanchins, who are also in Pavlovsk, visit the Prince. They are joined by their friend Yevgeny Pavlovich Radomsky, a handsome and wealthy military officer with a particular interest in Aglaya. Aglaya, however, is more interested in the Prince, and to Myshkin's embarrassment and everyone else's amusement, she recites Pushkin's poem \\"The Poor Knight\\" in a reference to his noble efforts to save Nastasya Filippovna. The Epanchins' visit is rudely interrupted by the arrival of Burdovsky, a young man who claims to be the illegitimate son of Myshkin's late benefactor, Pavlishchev. The inarticulate Burdovsky is supported by a group of insolent young men. These include the consumptive seventeen-year-old Ippolit Terentyev, the nihilist Doktorenko, and Keller, an ex-officer who, with the help of Lebedyev, has written an article vilifying the Prince and Pavlishchev. They demand money from Myshkin as a \\"just\\" reimbursement for Pavlishchev's support, but their arrogant bravado is severely dented when Gavril Ardalionovich, who has been researching the matter on Myshkin's behalf, proves conclusively that the claim is false and that Burdovsky has been deceived. The Prince tries to reconcile with the young men and offers financial support anyway. Disgusted, Lizaveta Prokofyevna loses all control and furiously attacks both parties. Ippolit laughs, and Lizaveta Prokofyevna seizes him by the arm, causing him to break into a prolonged fit of coughing. But he suddenly becomes calm, informs them all that he is near death, and politely requests that he be permitted to talk to them for a while. He awkwardly attempts to express his need for their love, eventually bringing both himself and Lizaveta Prokofyevna to the point of tears. But as the Prince and Lizaveta Prokofyevna discuss what to do with the invalid, another transformation occurs and Ippolit, after unleashing a torrent of abuse at the Prince, leaves with the other young men. The Epanchins also leave, both Lizaveta Prokofyevna and Aglaya deeply indignant with the Prince. Only Yevgeny Pavlovich remains in good spirits, and he smiles charmingly as he says good-bye. At that moment, a magnificent carriage pulls up at the dacha, and the ringing voice of Nastasya Filippovna calls out to Yevgeny Pavlovich. In a familiar tone, she tells him not to worry about all the IOUs as Rogozhin has bought them up. The carriage departs, leaving everyone, particularly Yevgeny Pavlovich and the Prince, in a state of shock. Yevgeny Pavlovich claims to know nothing about the debts, and Nastasya Filippovna's motives become a subject of anxious speculation. Part 3 Reconciling with Lizaveta Prokofyevna, the Prince visits the Epanchins at their dacha. He is beginning to fall in love with Aglaya, and she likewise appears to be fascinated by him, though she often mocks or angrily reproaches him for his naiveté and excessive humility. Myshkin joins Lizaveta Prokofyevna, her daughters and Yevgeny Pavlovich for a walk to the park to hear the music. While listening to the high-spirited conversation and watching Aglaya in a kind of daze, he notices Rogozhin and Nastasya Filippovna in the crowd. Nastasya Filippovna again addresses herself to Yevgeny Pavlovich, and in the same jolly tone as before loudly informs him that his uncle—a wealthy and respected old man from whom he is expecting a large inheritance—has shot himself and that a huge sum of government money is missing. Yevgeny Pavlovich stares at her in shock as Lizaveta Prokofyevna makes a hurried exit with her daughters. Nastasya Filippovna hears an officer friend of Yevgeny Pavlovich suggest that a whip is needed for women like her, and she responds by grabbing a riding-whip from a bystander and striking the officer across the face with it. He tries to attack her but Myshkin restrains him, for which he is violently pushed. Rogozhin, after making a mocking comment to the officer, leads Nastasya Filippovna away. The officer recovers his composure, addresses himself to Myshkin, politely confirms his name, and leaves. Myshkin follows the Epanchins back to their dacha, where eventually Aglaya finds him alone on the verandah. To his surprise, she begins to talk to him very earnestly about duels and how to load a pistol. They are interrupted by General Epanchin who wants Myshkin to walk with him. Aglaya slips a note into Myshkin's hand as they leave. The General is greatly agitated by the effect Nastasya Filippovna's behavior is having on his family, particularly since her information about Yevgeny Pavlovich's uncle has turned out to be completely correct. When the General leaves, Myshkin reads Aglaya's note, which is an urgent request to meet her secretly the following morning. His reflections are interrupted by Keller who has come to offer to be his second at the duel that will inevitably follow from the incident that morning, but Myshkin merely laughs heartily and invites Keller to visit him to drink champagne. Keller departs and Rogozhin appears. He informs the Prince that Nastasya Filippovna wants to see him and that she has been in correspondence with Aglaya. She is convinced that the Prince is in love with Aglaya, and is seeking to bring them together. Myshkin is perturbed by the information, but he remains in an inexplicably happy frame of mind and speaks with forgiveness and brotherly affection to Rogozhin. Remembering it will be his birthday tomorrow, he persuades Rogozhin to join him for some wine. They find that a large party has assembled at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyshchenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin's surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev's eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The essay is a painfully detailed description of the events and thoughts leading him to what he calls his 'final conviction': that suicide is the only possible way to affirm his will in the face of nature's invincible laws, and that consequently he will be shooting himself at sunrise. The reading drags on for over an hour and by its end the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, are bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually he falls asleep and the party disperses. The Prince wanders for some time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat appointed by Aglaya as their meeting place. Her laughter wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastasya Filippovna. They talk for a long time about the letters Aglaya has received, in which Nastasya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin. Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastasya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastasya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is not in love with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters back in her face, and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters with dread, and later that day Nastasya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her. Part 4 It is clear to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Epanchin that their daughter is in love with the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastasya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves. For a while the dinner party proceeds smoothly. Inexperienced in the ways of the aristocracy, Myshkin is deeply impressed by the elegance and good humour of the company, unsuspicious of its superficiality. It turns out that one of those present—Ivan Petrovich—is a relative of his beloved benefactor Pavlishchev, and the Prince becomes extraordinarily enthusiastic. But when Ivan Petrovich mentions that Pavlishchev ended by giving up everything and going over to the Catholic Church, Myshkin is horrified. He launches unexpectedly into an anti-Catholic tirade, claiming that it preaches the Antichrist and in its quest for political supremacy has given birth to Atheism. Everyone present is shocked and several attempts are made to stop or divert him, but he only becomes more animated. At the height of his fervor he begins waving his arms about and knocks over the priceless Chinese vase, smashing it to pieces. As Myshkin emerges from his profound astonishment, the general horror turns to amusement and concern for his health. But it is only temporary, and he soon begins another spontaneous discourse, this time on the subject of the aristocracy in Russia, once again becoming oblivious to all attempts to quell his ardour. The speech is only brought to an end by the onset of an epileptic seizure: Aglaya, deeply distressed, catches him in her arms as he falls. He is taken home, having left a decidedly negative impression on the guests. The next day Ippolit visits the Prince to inform him that he and others (such as Lebedyev and Ganya) have been intriguing against him, and have been unsettling Aglaya with talk of Nastasya Filippovna. Ippolit has arranged, at Aglaya's request and with Rogozhin's help, a meeting between the two women. That evening Aglaya, having left her home in secret, calls for the Prince. They proceed in silence to the appointed meeting place, where both Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin are already present. It soon becomes apparent that Aglaya has not come there to discuss anything, but to chastise and humiliate Nastasya Filippovna, and a bitter exchange of accusations and insults ensues. Nastasya Filippovna orders Rogozhin to leave and hysterically demands of Myshkin that he stay with her. Myshkin, once again torn by her suffering, is unable to deny her and reproaches Aglaya for her attack. Aglaya looks at him with pain and hatred, and runs off. He goes after her but Nastasya Filippovna stops him desperately and then faints. Myshkin stays with her. In accordance with Nastasya Filippovna's wish, she and the Prince become engaged. Public opinion is highly critical of Myshkin's actions toward Aglaya, and the Epanchins break off all relations with him. He tries to explain to Yevgeny Pavlovich that Nastasya Filippovna is a broken soul, that he must stay with her or she will probably die, and that Aglaya will understand if he is only allowed to talk to her. Yevgeny Pavlovich refuses to facilitate any contact between them and suspects that Myshkin himself is mad. On the day of the wedding, a beautifully attired Nastasya Filippovna is met by Keller and Burdovsky, who are to escort her to the church where Myshkin is waiting. A large crowd has gathered, among whom is Rogozhin. Seeing him, Nastasya Filippovna rushes to him and tells him hysterically to take her away, which Rogozhin loses no time in doing. The Prince, though shaken, is not particularly surprised at this development. For the remainder of the day he calmly fulfills his social obligations to guests and members of the public. The following morning he takes the first train to Petersburg and goes to Rogozhin's house, but he is told by servants that there is no one there. After several hours of fruitless searching, he returns to the hotel he was staying at when he last encountered Rogozhin in Petersburg. Rogozhin appears and asks him to come back to the house. They enter the house in secret and Rogozhin leads him to the dead body of Nastasya Filippovna: he has stabbed her through the heart. The two men keep vigil over the body, which Rogozhin has laid out in his study. Rogozhin is sentenced to fifteen years hard labor in Siberia. Myshkin goes mad and, through the efforts of Yevgeny Pavlovich, returns to the sanatorium in Switzerland. The Epanchins go abroad and Aglaya elopes with a wealthy, exiled Polish count who later is discovered to be neither wealthy, nor a count, nor an exile—at least, not a political exile—and who, along with a Catholic priest, has turned her against her family.  Characters  Major characters :(For further discussion of the major characters see Prince Myshkin) Prince Myshkin, the novel's central character, is a young man who has returned to Russia after a long period abroad where he was receiving treatment for epilepsy. The lingering effects of the illness, combined with his innocence and lack of social experience, sometimes create the superficial and completely false impression of mental or psychological deficiency. Most of the other characters at one time or another refer to him disparagingly as an 'idiot', but nearly all of them are deeply affected by him. In truth he is highly intelligent, self-aware, intuitive and empathic. He is someone who has thought deeply about human nature, morality and spirituality, and is capable of expressing those thoughts with great clarity. Nastasya Filippovna, the main female protagonist, is darkly beautiful, intelligent, fierce and mocking, an intimidating figure to most of the other characters. Of noble birth but orphaned at age 7, she was manipulated into a position of sexual servitude by her guardian, the voluptuary Totsky. Her broken innocence and the social perception of disgrace produce an intensely emotional and destructive personality. The Prince is deeply moved by her beauty and her suffering, and despite feeling that she is insane, remains devoted to her. She is torn between Myshkin's compassion and Rogozhin's obsession with her. Rogózhin (Parfyón Semyónovich), who has just inherited a huge fortune from his merchant father, is madly in love with Nastasya Filippovna, and recklessly abandons himself to pursuing her. He instinctively likes and trusts the Prince when they first meet, but later develops a hatred for him out of jealousy. The character represents passionate, instinctive love, as opposed to Myshkin's Christian love based in compassion. Agláya Ivánovna is the radiantly beautiful youngest daughter of Myshkin's distant relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna and her husband, the wealthy and respected General Epanchin. Aglaya is proud, commanding and impatient, but also full of arch humour, laughter and innocence, and the Prince is particularly drawn to her after the darkness of his time with Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin. Ippolít Teréntyev is a young nihilist intellectual who is in the final stages of tuberculosis and near death. Still full of youthful idealism, he craves love and recognition from others, but their indifference and his own morbid self-obsession lead him to increasing extremes of cynicism and defiance. The character is a 'quasi-double' for Myshkin: their circumstances force them to address the same metaphysical questions, but their responses are diametrically opposed.Frank (2010). p. 582 Other characters *Gánya (Gavríl Ardaliónovich) – a capable but extremely vain and avaricious young man, he offers himself in marriage to Nastasya Filippovna, whom he secretly hates, on the promise of riches from Totsky, but she rejects and humiliates him. He also tries to compete with Myshkin for Aglaya's affections. A mediocrity who imagines himself original, Ganya represents love from vanity, and is contrasted with Myshkin and Rogozhin.Frank (2010). p. 569 *Lébedyev (Lukyán Timoféevich) – a roguish drunkard whose restless curiosity and petty ambition have made him into a kind of repository of social information. He uses this to ingratiate himself with superiors, and to pursue various schemes and intrigues. His unpleasant tendencies are offset to some extent by a mischievous sense of humour, a sharp intellect, and occasional bouts of abject self-condemnation and compassion for others. *Lizavéta Prokófyevna – Aglaya's mother and Myshkin's distant relative. Though child- like in the spontaneity of her emotions, she is strong-willed and imperious, particularly about matters of honour and morality. Myshkin considers her and Aglaya to be very alike. *General Iván Fyódorovich Epanchín – Aglaya's father. *Alexándra Ivánovna – Aglaya's sister, eldest daughter of Ivan Fyodorovich and Lizaveta Prokofyevna. *Adelaída Ivánovna – Aglaya's sister, second daughter of Ivan Fyodorovich and Lizaveta Prokofyevna. *Prince Shch. (or Prince S) – a 'liberal' aristocrat who marries Adelaida Ivanovna. *Yevgény Pávlovich Radómsky – a handsome military officer who is a close friend of the Epanchins. His rumoured interest in Aglaya leads Nastasya Filippovna (who wants to bring Aglaya and the Prince together) to publicly expose some unsavoury aspects of his background. Despite this, he and the Prince become friends and have a mutual respect for each other's intelligence. *Afanásy Ivánovich Tótsky – a wealthy aristocrat and libertine, a friend and business associate of General Epanchin. He is the former guardian of Nastasya Filippovna. *General Ívolgin (Ardalión Alexándrovich) – Ganya's father, a highly honourable man, but a drunkard and mythomaniac. He is the subject of a subplot in Part 4, involving the theft of 400 rubles from Lebedyev *Nína Alexándrovna – General Ivolgin's long-suffering wife, and mother of Ganya, Varya and Kolya. *Kólya (Nikolay Ardaliónovich) – Ganya's younger brother.

He begins by aggressively demanding money from the Prince, but later becomes an admirer. *Kéller – a retired Lieutenant, initially one of Rogozhin's crew, he becomes an associate of Ippolit and Burdovsky and writes a slanderous article about the Prince. He later develops a great admiration for the Prince and seeks to defend him. *Doktorenko – Lebedyev's nephew, a nihilist who, along with Ippolit, leads Burdovsky's attack on the Prince. *Véra Lukyánovna – Lebedyev's daughter. Themes Atheism and Christianity in Russia A dialogue between the intimately related themes of atheism and Christian faith (meaning, for Dostoevsky, Russian Orthodoxy) pervades the entire novel. Dostoevsky's personal image of Christian faith, formed prior to his philosophical engagement with Orthodoxy but never abandoned, was one that emphasized the human need for belief in the immortality of the soul, and identified Christ with ideals of \\"beauty, truth, brotherhood and Russia\\".William Mills Todd III. Introduction to The Idiot (trans. McDuff). 2004. Penguin Classics. p. xxiv. The character of Prince Myshkin was originally intended to be an embodiment of this \\"lofty (Russian) Christian idea\\". With the character's immersion in the increasingly materialistic and atheistic world of late 19th century Russia, the idea is constantly being elaborated, tested in every scene and against every other character. However, Myshkin's Christianity is not a doctrine or a set of beliefs but is something that he lives spontaneously in his relations with all others. Whenever he appears \\"hierarchical barriers between people suddenly become penetrable, an inner contact is formed between them... His personality possesses the peculiar capacity to relativize everything that disunifies people and imparts a false seriousness to life.\\" The young nihilist Ippolit Terentyev is the character that provides the most coherent articulation of the atheist challenge to Myshkin's worldview, most notably in the long essay 'An Essential Explanation' which he reads to the gathering at the Prince's birthday celebration in part 3 of the novel.William Mills Todd III. Introduction to The Idiot (trans. McDuff). 2004. p. xxxi. Here he picks up a motif first touched upon early in part 2, in a dialogue between Myshkin and Rogozhin, when they are contemplating the copy of Holbein's Dead Christ in Rogozhin's house, and Rogozhin confesses that the painting is eroding his faith. Holbein's painting held a particular significance for Dostoevsky because he saw in it his own impulse \\"to confront Christian faith with everything that negated it\\".Frank (2010). p. 550 The character of Ippolit argues that the painting, which depicts with unflinching realism the tortured, already putrefying corpse of Christ within the tomb, represents the triumph of blind nature over the vision of immortality in God that Christ's existence on Earth signified. He is unable to share Myshkin's intuition of the harmonious unity of all Being, an intuition evoked most intensely earlier in the novel in a description of the pre-epileptic aura.Frank (2010). p. 561Dostoevsky, F. The Idiot (2004). Part 2, chapter 5, pp. 263–64. Consequently, the inexorable laws of nature appear to Ippolit as something monstrous, particularly in the light of his own approaching death from tuberculosis: > \\"It is as though this painting were the means by which this idea of a dark, > brazen and senseless eternal force, to which everything is subordinate, is > expressed... I remember someone taking me by the arm, a candle in his hands, > and showing me some sort of enormous and repulsive tarantula, assuring me > that this was that same dark, blind and all-powerful creature, and laughing > at my indignation.\\"Dostoevsky, F.The Idiot (2004). Part 3, chapter 6, p. > 477. The Prince does not directly engage with Ippolit's atheistic arguments, as a religious ideologist might: rather, he recognizes Ippolit as a kindred spirit, and empathetically perceives his youthful struggle with both his own inner negation and the cruelty, irony, and indifference of the world around him.Dostoevsky, F. The Idiot (2004). Part 3, chapter 7, pp. 493–98.Frank (2010). p. 561 Catholicism The Prince's Christianity, insofar as he is the embodiment of the 'Russian Christian idea', explicitly excludes Catholicism. His unexpected tirade at the Epanchins' dinner party is based in unequivocal assertions that Catholicism is \\"an unChristian faith\\", that it preaches the Antichrist, and that its appropriation and distortion of Christ's teaching into a basis for the attainment of political supremacy has given birth to atheism. The Catholic Church, he claims, is merely a continuation of the Western Roman Empire: cynically exploiting the person and teaching of Christ it has installed itself on the earthly throne and taken up the sword to entrench and expand its power. This is a betrayal of the true teaching of Christ, a teaching that transcends the lust for earthly power (the Devil's Third Temptation), and speaks directly to the individual's and the people's highest emotions—those that spring from what Myshkin calls \\"spiritual thirst\\". Atheism and socialism are a reaction, born of profound disillusionment, to the Church's defilement of its own moral and spiritual authority.Dostoevsky, F. The Idiot (2004). Part 4, chapter 7, pp. 633–35. It is because of this \\"spiritual thirst\\" that Myshkin is so uncompromisingly scathing about the influence of Catholicism and atheism in Russia.Frank (2010). p. 586 The Russian, he claims, not only feels this thirst with great urgency, but is, by virtue of it, particularly susceptible to false faiths: > \\"In our country if a man goes over to Catholicism, he unfailingly becomes a > Jesuit, and one of the most clandestine sort, at that; if he becomes an > atheist, he will at once begin to demand the eradication of belief in God by > coercion, that is, by the sword... It is not from vanity alone, not from > mere sordid vain emotions that Russian atheists and Russian Jesuits proceed, > but from a spiritual pain, a spiritual thirst, a yearning for something more > exalted, for a firm shore, a motherland in which they have ceased to > believe...\\"Dostoevsky, F. The Idiot (2004). Part 4, chapter 7, p. 636. The theme of the maleficent influence of Catholicism on the Russian soul is expressed, in a less obvious and polemical way, through the character of Aglaya Epanchin. Passionate and idealistic, like 'the Russian' alluded to in the anti-Catholic diatribe, Aglaya struggles with the ennui of middle class mediocrity and hates the moral vacuity of the aristocracy to whom her parents kowtow. Her 'yearning for the exalted' has attracted her to militant Catholicism, and in the Prince's devotion to Nastasya Filippovna she sees the heroism of a Crusader-Knight abandoning everything to go in to battle for his Christian ideal. She is deeply angry when, instead of \\"defending himself triumphantly\\" against his enemies (Ippolit and his nihilist friends), he tries to make peace with them and offers assistance.Frank (2010). p. 586Dostoevsky, F. The Idiot (2004). Part 2, chapters 7–8. Aglaya's tendency to misinterpret Myshkin's motives leads to fractures in what is otherwise a blossoming of innocent love. When the Epanchins go abroad after the final catastrophe, Aglaya, under the influence of a Catholic priest, abandons her family and elopes with a Polish 'Count'. Innocence and guilt In his notes Dostoevsky distinguishes the Prince from other characters of the virtuous type in fiction (such as Don Quixote and Pickwick) by emphasizing innocence rather than comicality. In one sense Myshkin's innocence is an instrument of satire since it brings in to sharp relief the corruption and egocentricity of those around him. But his innocence is serious rather than comical, and he has a deeper insight into the psychology of human beings in general by assuming its presence in everyone else, even as they laugh at him, or try to deceive and exploit him.William Mills Todd III. Introduction to The Idiot (trans. McDuff). 2004. Penguin Classics. pp. xxiv–xxvi. Examples of this combination of innocence and insight can be found in Myshkin's interactions with virtually all the other characters.Bakhtin, Mikhail (1984). p. 242 He explains it himself in an episode with the roguish but 'honourable' Keller, who has confessed that he has sought the Prince out for motives that are simultaneously noble (he wants spiritual guidance) and mercenary (he wants to borrow a large sum of money from him). The Prince guesses that he has come to borrow money before he has even mentioned it, and unassumingly engages him in a conversation about the psychological oddity of 'double thoughts': > Two thoughts coincided, that very often happens... I think it's a bad thing > and, you know, Keller, I reproach myself most of all for it. What you told > me just now could have been about me. I've even sometimes thought that all > human beings are like that, because it's terribly difficult to fight those > double thoughts... At any rate, I am not your judge... You used cunning to > coax money out of me by means of tears, but you yourself swear that your > confession had a different aim, a noble one; as for the money, you need it > to go on a drinking spree, don't you? And after such a confession that's > weakness of course. But how can one give up drinking sprees in a single > moment? It's impossible. So what is to be done? It is best to leave it to > your own conscience, what do you think?The Idiot (2004). Part 2, Chapter 11, > p. 362 Aglaya Ivanovna, despite her occasional fury at his apparent passivity, understands this aspect of Myshkin's innocence, and expresses it in their conversation at the green seat when she speaks of the \\"two parts of the mind: one that's important and one that's not important\\". The Idiot (2004). Part 3, Chapter 8, p. 500 Nastasya Filippovna is a character who embodies the internal struggle between innocence and guilt. Isolated and sexually exploited by Totsky from the age of sixteen, Nastasya Filippovna has inwardly embraced her social stigmatization as a corrupted 'fallen woman', but this conviction is intimately bound to its opposite—the victimized child's sense of a broken innocence that longs for vindication. The combination produces a cynical and destructive outer persona, which disguises a fragile and deeply hurt inner being. When the Prince speaks to her, he addresses only this inner being, and in him she sees and hears the long dreamt-of affirmation of her innocence. But the self-destructive voice of her guilt, so intimately bound to the longing for innocence, does not disappear as a result, and constantly reasserts itself. Myshkin divines that in her constant reiteration of her shame there is a \\"dreadful, unnatural pleasure, as if it were a revenge on someone.\\"The Idiot (2004). Part 3, Chapter 8, p. 506 Its principal outward form is the repeated choice to submit herself to Rogozhin's obsession with her, knowing that its end result will almost certainly be her own death.Bakhtin, Mikhail (1984). pp. 257–58 The theme of the intrapsychic struggle between innocence and guilt is manifested, in idiosyncratic forms, in many of the characters in the novel. The character of General Ivolgin, for example, constantly tells outrageous lies, but to those who understand him (such as Myshkin, Lebedyev and Kolya) he is the noblest and most honest of men.The Idiot (2004). Part 4, Chapter 4, p. 574 He commits a theft out of weakness, but is so overcome by shame that it helps precipitate a stroke.Frank (2010). p. 585 Lebedyev is constantly plotting and swindling, but he is also deeply religious, and is periodically overcome by paroxysms of guilt-ridden self-loathing. Myshkin himself has a strong tendency to feel ashamed of his own thoughts and actions. The fact that Rogozhin reaches the point of attacking him with a knife is something for which he feels himself to be equally guilty because his own half-conscious suspicions were the same as Rogozhin's half-conscious impulse.The Idiot (2004). Part 3, Chapter 3, p. 425 When Burdovsky, who has unceremoniously demanded money from him on the basis of a falsehood, gets increasingly insulted by his attempts to offer assistance, Myshkin reproaches himself for his own clumsiness and lack of tact.The Idiot (2004). Part 2, Chapter 9, p. 329 Autobiographical themes Capital punishment In 1849, Dostoevsky was sentenced to execution by firing squad for his part in the activities of the Petrashevsky Circle. Shortly after the period of interrogation and trial, he and his fellow prisoners were taken, without warning, to Semyonovsky Square where the sentence of death was read out over them. The first three prisoners were tied to stakes facing the firing squad: Dostoevsky was among the next in line. Just as the first shots were about to be fired, a message arrived from the Tsar commuting the sentences to hard labor in Siberia. The experience had a profound effect on Dostoevsky, and in Part 1 of The Idiot (written twenty years after the event) the character of Prince Myshkin repeatedly speaks in depth on the subject of capital punishment. On one occasion, conversing with the Epanchin women, he recounts an anecdote that exactly mirrors Dostoevsky's own experience. A man of 27, who had committed a political offence, was taken to the scaffold with his comrades, where a death sentence by firing squad was read out to them. Twenty minutes later, with all the preparations for the execution having been completed, they were unexpectedly reprieved, but for those twenty minutes the man lived with the complete certainty that he was soon to face sudden death. The Prince recounts in detail what the man experienced during those twenty minutes.The Idiot (2004). Part 1, Chapter 5, pp. 70–72. The subject of capital punishment first comes up earlier in Part 1, when the Prince is waiting with a servant for General Epanchin to appear. Engaging the servant in conversation, the Prince tells the harrowing story of an execution by guillotine that he recently witnessed in France. He concludes the description with his own reflections on the horror of death by execution: > ... the worst, most violent pain lies not in injuries, but in the fact that > you know for certain that within the space of an hour, then ten minutes, > then half a minute, then now, right at this moment—your soul will fly out of > your body, and you'll no longer be a human being, and that this is certain; > the main thing is that it is certain. When you put your head right under the > guillotine and hear it sliding above your head, it's that quarter of a > second that's most terrible of all... Who can say that human nature is able > to endure such a thing without going mad? Why such mockery—ugly, > superfluous, futile? Perhaps the man exists to whom his sentence has been > read out, has been allowed to suffer, and then been told: \\"off you go, > you've been pardoned\\". A man like that could tell us perhaps. Such suffering > and terror were what Christ spoke of. No, a human being should not be > treated like that!The Idiot (2004). Part 1, Chapter 5, p. 27. Later, when he is conversing with the Epanchin sisters, the Prince suggests to Adelaida, who has asked him for a subject to paint, that she paint the face of a condemned man a minute before the guillotine falls. He carefully explains his reasons for the suggestion, enters in to the emotions and thoughts of the condemned man, and describes in meticulous detail what the painting should depict.The Idiot (2004). Part 1, Chapter 5, pp. 75–78. In part 2, the usually comical character of Lebedyev also considers the horror of the moment before execution. In the midst of a heated exchange with his nihilist nephew he expresses deep compassion for the soul of the Countess du Barry, who died in terror on the guillotine after pleading for her life with the executioner.The Idiot (2004). Part 2, Chapter 5, pp. 230–31. Epilepsy For much of his adult life Dostoevsky suffered from an unusual and at times extremely debilitating form of temporal lobe epilepsy. In 1867 (the same year he began work on The Idiot) he wrote to his doctor: \\"this epilepsy will end up by carrying me off... My memory has grown completely dim. I don't recognize people anymore... I'm afraid of going mad or falling into idiocy\\".quoted in Frank (2010). p. 557 Dostoevsky's attacks were preceded by a brief period of intense joyous mystical experience which he described as being worth years of his life, or perhaps even his whole life. A similar illness plays an important part in the characterization of Prince Myshkin, partly because the severity of the condition and its after-effects (disorientation, amnesia, aphasia, among others) contributes significantly to the myth of the character's 'idiocy'. Although Myshkin himself is completely aware that he is not an 'idiot' in any pejorative sense, he sometimes concedes the aptness of the word in relation to his mental state during particularly severe attacks. He occasionally makes reference to the pre-narrative period prior to his confinement in a Swiss sanatorium, when the symptoms were chronic and he really was \\"almost an idiot\\".The Idiot (2004). pp. 104, 318, 322 Paradoxically, it is also clear that aspects of the disease are intimately connected to a profound intensification of his mental faculties, and are a significant cause of the development of his higher spiritual preoccupations: > ...there was a certain stage almost immediately before the fit itself when, > amidst the sadness, the mental darkness, the pressure, his brain suddenly > seemed to burst into flame, and with an extraordinary jolt all his vital > forces seemed to be tensed together. The sensation of life and of self- > awareness increased tenfold at those moments... The mind, the heart were > flooded with an extraordinary light; all his unrest, all his doubts, all his > anxieties were resolved into a kind of higher calm, full of a serene, > harmonious joy and hope.The Idiot (2004). pp. 263–65 Although for Myshkin these moments represented an intimation of the highest truth, he also knew that \\"stupefaction, mental darkness, idiocy stood before him as the consequence of these 'highest moments'.\\" At the end of the novel, after Rogozhin has murdered Nastasya Filippovna, the Prince appears to descend completely into this darkness. Mortality Death, the consciousness of its inevitability and the effect that this consciousness has on the living soul, is a recurring theme in the novel. A number of characters are shaped, each according to the nature of their own self-consciousness, by their proximity to death. Most notable in this respect are Prince Myshkin, Ippolit, Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin. The anecdote of the man reprieved from execution is an illustration, drawn from the author's own experience, of the extraordinary value of life as revealed in the moment of imminent death. The most terrible realization for the condemned man, according to Myshkin, is that of a wasted life, and he is consumed by the desperate desire for another chance. After his reprieve, the man vows to live every moment of life conscious of its infinite value (although he confesses to failing to fulfil the vow). Through his own emergence from a prolonged period on the brink of derangement, unconsciousness and death, the Prince himself has awoken to the joyous wonder of life, and all his words, moral choices and relations with others are guided by this fundamental insight. Joseph Frank, drawing on the theology of Albert Schweitzer, places the Prince's insight in the context of \\"the eschatological tension that is the soul of the primitive Christian ethic, whose doctrine of Agape was conceived in the same perspective of the imminent end of time.\\"Frank (2010). p. 579 Myshkin asserts that in the ecstatic moment of the pre- epileptic aura he is able to comprehend the extraordinary phrase (from the Book of Revelation, 10:6): \\"there shall be time no longer\\".The Idiot (2004). p. 265 Like Myshkin, Ippolit is haunted by death and has a similar reverence for the beauty and mystery of life, but his self-absorbed atheist-nihilist worldview pushes him toward opposite conclusions. While the Prince's worldview reflects the birth of his faith in a higher world-harmony, Ippolit's concern with death develops into a metaphysical resentment of nature's omnipotence, her utter indifference to human suffering in general and to his own suffering in particular. Thus he conceives the idea of suicide as a final assertion of his will in an act of defiance against nature.Frank (2010). p. 583 Style Temporality Dostoevsky's notebooks for The Idiot during the time of its serial publication clearly indicate that he never knew what successive installments would contain.Morson (2018). p. 8 The method of testing the central idea in a series of extreme situations, allowing each character to freely respond, meant that there could be no pre-determined development of either plot or character: the author himself was just as surprised as the characters at what happened or didn't happen.Morson (2018). p. 13 This uncontrived approach to writing becomes, in the novel, a depiction of what Morson calls \\"the openness of time\\". In the usual novel, the apparently free acts of the characters are an illusion as they only serve to bring about a future that has been contrived by the author. But in real life, even with a belief in determinism or preordination, the subject always assumes its freedom and acts as though the future were unwritten. Dostoevsky's extemporaneous approach helped facilitate the representation of the actual position of human subjectivity, as an open field of possibility where the will is free at all times, despite the apparent necessity of cause and effect.Morson (2018). pp. 8–15 According to Mikhail Bakhtin, \\"Dostoevsky always represents a person on the threshold of a final decision, at a moment of crisis, at an unfinalizable—and unpredeterminable—turning point for their soul.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 61 Carnivalization Bakhtin argues that Dostoevsky always wrote in opposition to modern tendencies toward the \\"reification of man\\"—the turning of human beings into objects (scientific, economic, social, etc.), enclosing them in an alien web of definition and causation, robbing them of freedom and responsibility.Bakhtin (1984). pp. 61–62 'Carnivalization' is a term used by Bakhtin to describe the techniques Dostoevsky uses to disarm this increasingly ubiquitous enemy and make true intersubjective dialogue possible. The concept suggests an ethos where normal hierarchies, social roles, proper behaviors and assumed truths are subverted in favor of the \\"joyful relativity\\" of free participation in the festival. In The Idiot, everything revolves around the two central carnival figures of the \\"idiot\\" and the \\"madwoman\\", and consequently \\"all of life is carnivalized, turned into a \\"world inside out\\": traditional plot situations radically change their meaning, there develops a dynamic, carnivalistic play of sharp contrasts, unexpected shifts and changes\\".Bakhtin (1984). p. 173 Prince Myshkin and Nastasya Filippovna are characters that inherently elude conventional social definition, or—as Bakhtin puts it—anything that might limit their \\"pure humanness\\". The carnival atmosphere that develops around them in each situation and dialogue (\\"bright and joyous\\" in Myshkin's case, \\"dark and infernal\\" in Nastasya Filippovna's) allows Dostoevsky to \\"expose a different side of life to himself and to the reader, to spy upon and depict in that life certain new, unknown depths and possibilities.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 174 Polyphony Carnivalization helps generate the artistic phenomenon that Bakhtin felt was unique to Dostoevsky in literature: Polyphony. Analogous to musical polyphony, literary polyphony is the simultaneous presence of multiple independent voices, each with its own truth and validity, but always coincident with other voices, affecting them and being affected by them. Bakhtin defines it as \\"the event of interaction between autonomous and internally unfinalized consciousnesses\\".Bakhtin (1984). p. 176 In the polyphonic novel each character's voice speaks for itself: the narrator and even the author are present in the narrative merely as one voice among others. No voice has a privileged authority, and all have a form that inherently expresses engagement with other voices. Thus events unfold dialogically, as a consequence of the interaction between discrete voices, not as a consequence of authorial design: > What unfolds... is not a multitude of characters and fates in a single > objective world, illuminated by a single authorial consciousness; rather a > plurality of consciousnesses, with equal rights and each with its own world, > combine but are not merged in the unity of the event. Dostoevsky's major > heroes are, by the very nature of his creative design, not only objects of > authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying > discourse.Bakhtin (1984). pp. 6–7 Narrator and author Despite the appearance of omniscience, the narrator of The Idiot is given a distinct voice like any other character, and often conveys only a partial understanding of the events he is describing. It is the voice of a highly perceptive and meticulous reporter of the facts, who has, despite this objectivity, a particular perspective on what he is reporting, occasionally even lapsing into pontification. At one point in his notes Dostoevsky admonishes himself to \\"write more concisely: only the facts. Write in the sense of people say...\\"quoted in Frank (2010). p. 570 The narrator's resort to 'the facts' has the effect of \\"placing the facts on the side of rumor and mystery rather than on the side of description and explanation.\\" The narrator is thus not omniscient, but a particular kind of insightful but limited spectator, and in the end he openly admits to the reader that the Prince's behaviour is inexplicable to him.The Idiot (2004). Part 4, chapter 9. pp. 668–71 According to Frank, \\"this limitation of the narrator is part of Dostoevsky's effort to present Myshkin's behaviour as transcending all the categories of worldly moral-social experience.\\"Frank (2010). pp. 570–71 For Bakhtin the narrator's voice is another participant, albeit of a special kind, in the \\"great dialogue\\" that constitutes the Dostoevsky novel. All voices, all ideas, once they enter the world of the novel, take on an imaginary form that positions them in dialogical relationship with the other voices and ideas. In this sense, even the author's own ideological positions, when they are expressed through the narrator, or Myshkin, or Lebedyev, \\"become thoroughly dialogized and enter the great dialogue of the novel on completely equal terms with the other idea-images\\".Bakhtin (1984). p. 92 Since the most important thing for Dostoevsky in the construction of his novels is the dialogic interaction of a multiplicity of voices, the author's discourse \\"cannot encompass the hero and his word on all sides, cannot lock in and finalize him from without. It can only address itself to him.\\"Bakhtin (1984). p. 231 Reception Critical reception of The Idiot at the time of its publication in Russia was almost uniformly negative. This was partly because a majority of the reviewers considered themselves to be opposed to Dostoevsky's 'conservatism', and wished to discredit the book's supposed political intentions. However the chief criticism, among both reviewers and general readers, was in the \\"fantasticality\\" of the characters.Frank (2010). p. 575 The radical critic D.I. Minaev wrote: \\"People meet, fall in love, slap each other's face—and all at the author's first whim, without any artistic truth.\\"review in The Spark (1868) 18:221, quoted in Terras (1990). p. 9 V.P. Burenin, a liberal, described the novel's presentation of the younger generation as \\"the purest fruit of the writer's subjective fancy\\" and the novel as a whole as \\"a belletristic compilation, concocted from a multitude of absurd personages and events, without any concern for any kind of artistic objectivity.\\"reviews in The St. Petersburg News (1868) quoted in Terras (1990). p. 10. Leading radical critic Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin approved of Dostoevsky's attempt to depict the genuinely good man, but castigated him for his scurrilous treatment of \\"the very people whose efforts are directed at the very objective apparently pursued by him... On the one hand there appear characters full of life and truth, but on the other, some kind of mysterious puppets hopping about as though in a dream...\\"review in National Annals (April 1871) pp. 301–03, quoted in Terras (1990). p. 11 Dostoevsky responded to Maykov's reports of the prevailing 'fantastical' criticisms with an unashamed characterization of his literary philosophy as \\"fantastic realism\\", and claimed that it was far more real, taking contemporary developments in Russia in to consideration, than the so-called realism of his detractors, and could even be used to predict future events.Frank (2010). p. 575 French and English translations were published in 1887, and a German translation in 1889. European critical response was also largely negative, mainly due to the novel's apparent formlessness and rambling style.Terras (1990). p. 14 Morson notes that critics saw it as \\"a complete mess, as if it were written extemporaneously, with no overall structure in mind—as, in fact, it was.\\"Gary Saul Morson (2018). The Idiot Savant p. 7 Typical of the western critics was the introduction to the first French translation which, while praising the energetic style and characterization, notes that \\"they are enveloped in a fantastic mist and get lost in innumerable digressions.\\"E.-M de Vogüé. Quoted in Terras (1990). p. 14 Prominent modern critics acknowledge the novel's apparent structural deficiencies, but also point out that the author was aware of them himself, and that they were perhaps a natural consequence of the experimental approach toward the central idea. Joseph Frank has called The Idiot \\"perhaps the most original of Dostoevsky's great novels, and certainly the most artistically uneven of them all,\\" but he also wondered how it was that the novel \\"triumphed so effortlessly over the inconsistencies and awkwardnesses of its structure.\\" Gary Saul Morson observes that \\"The Idiot brings to mind the old saw about how, according to the laws of physics, bumblebees should be unable to fly, but bumblebees, not knowing physics, go on flying anyway.\\"Gary Saul Morson (2018). The Idiot Savant p. 7 The twentieth century Russian literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin regarded the structural asymmetry and unpredictability of plot development, as well as the perceived 'fantasticality' of the characters, not as any sort of deficiency, but as entirely consistent with Dostoevsky's unique and groundbreaking literary method.Bakhtin (1984). pp. 172–74 Bakhtin saw Dostoevsky as the preeminent exemplar of the Carnivalesque in literature, and as the inventor of the Polyphonic novel. A literary approach that incorporates carnivalisation and polyphony in Bakhtin's sense precludes any sort of conventionally recognizable structure or predictable pattern of plot development.  English translations  Since The Idiot was first published in Russian, there have been a number of translations into English, including those by: * Frederick Whishaw (1887) * Constance Garnett (1913)  Revised by Anna Brailovsky (2003) * Eva Martin (1915) * David Magarshack (1955) * John W. Strahan (1965) * Henry Carlisle and Olga Andreyeva Carlisle (1980) * Alan Myers (1992) * Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (2002) * David McDuff (2004) * Ignat Avsey (2010) The Constance Garnett translation was for many years accepted as the definitive English translation, but more recently it has come under criticism for being dated. The Garnett translation, however, still remains widely available because it is now in the public domain. Some writers, such as Anna Brailovsky, have based their translations on Garnett's. Since the 1990s, new English translations have appeared that have made the novel more accessible to English readers. The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation (2000) states that the Alan Myers version is the \\"best version currently available\\". Since then, however, new translations by David McDuff and Pevear & Volokhonsky have also been well received.  Adaptations  * Several filmmakers have produced adaptations of the novel, among them Wandering Souls (Carl Froelich; 1921)http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/film/en/41894.aspx?id=41894 L'idiot (Georges Lampin; 1946), a 1951 version by Akira Kurosawa, a 1958 version by Russian director Ivan Pyryev, the Bengali film Aparichito (Salil Dutta; 1969), and a 1992 Hindi version by Mani Kaul. An unfinished silent version by Sergei Eisenstein was once shown in the Soviet Union, the last reel \\"lost\\" over a disagreement with Joseph Stalin on the ending. Andrei Tarkovsky aspired to eventually produce a film adaptation of The Idiot, but was constantly obfuscated by Soviet state censors. He was contracted by Mosfilm to write a screenplay in 1983, but production halted after he announced his intent never to return to the Soviet Union. Tarkovsky's other films, such as Stalker, incorporate many themes from The Idiot. * In 1966, the British Broadcasting Corporation screened a five-part adaptation of The Idiot on BBC-2. It was directed by Alan Bridges and starred David Buck as Prince Myskin and Adrienne Corri as Nastasia. * In 2003, Russian State Television produced a 10-part, 8-hour mini-series of the work, directed by Vladimir Bortko for Russia 1, which is available with English subtitles. * In 1999, the Tabakov Theatre produced an adaptation of the novel, adapted and directed by Alexandre Marine with the show later airing on the Kultura television as TV-play. * In 1994, the Polish director Andrzej Wajda adapted the last chapter of The Idiot as the feature film Nastasja. * BBC Radio 7 broadcast a 4-episode adaptation of The Idiot entitled Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Idiot, in June 2010. It starred Paul Rhys as Prince Myshkin. * Simon Gray's stage adaptation was produced by the National Theatre Company at the Old Vic Theatre, London, in 1970, starring Derek Jacobi. * In October 2011, the Estonian director Rainer Sarnet adapted the book to a feature film The Idiot, starring Risto Kübar as Prince Myshkin.

Commissioned in 1949, she was the world's last heavy cruiser to enter service and is the only one still in existence. She was decommissioned in 1959, after serving in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. She is open to the public as a museum ship in Quincy, Massachusetts. Construction and shakedown Salem was laid down on 4 July 1945 by the Bethlehem Steel Co.'s Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Mass.; launched on 25 March 1947; sponsored by Miss Mary G. Coffey; and commissioned on 14 May 1949, Captain J. C. Daniel in command. Her main battery held the world's first automatic 8\\" guns and were the first 8\\" naval guns to use cased ammunition instead of shell and bag loading. After a visit to Salem, Mass., on 4 July 1949, Salem underwent three months of shakedown at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, between July and October 1949, followed by post-shakedown repairs at the Boston Navy Yard. She then made two cruises to Guantanamo in November and December 1949, and participated in maneuvers with the Atlantic Fleet in early 1950. Naval service Salem departed the east coast on 3 May 1950; and, on 17 May, relieved Newport News (CA-148) as flagship of the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. During this, the first of seven deployments to the Mediterranean as fleet flagship, Salem visited ports in Malta, Italy, France, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, and Algeria, and participated in training exercises. On 22 September, she was relieved by Newport News and returned to the United States. After three weeks at Boston, Salem joined the Atlantic Fleet for maneuvers; and, on 3 January 1951, sailed for six weeks of intensive gunnery training at Guantanamo. She completed her training off Bermuda; and, on 20 March, sailed for the Mediterranean to relieve Newport News as 6th Fleet flagship. On 19 September, she was relieved by Des Moines (CA-134) and returned to the United States for four months of overhaul at Boston. Salem sailed on 1 February 1952 for refresher training at Guantanamo and returned to Boston on 29 March for brief repairs. On 19 April, she sailed for her third Mediterranean deployment, relieving Newport News at Algiers on 28 April. Besides the normal port calls and exercises, Salem participated in Exercise \\"Beehive II,\\" which involved units of the United States, British, Italian, French, and Greek navies. She was relieved once again by Des Moines on 29 September and arrived at Boston on 9 October. After four months of local operations, Salem sailed for Guantanamo Bay on 24 January 1953 for training. Returning to Boston on 27 February, she sailed for the Mediterranean on 17 April and again relieved Newport News as flagship. Her fourth deployment was marked by Exercise \\"Weldfest\\" and by emergency relief work after the 1953 Ionian earthquake which devastated the Ionian Islands. Salem was the first American ship to arrive on the scene, and provided relief supplies and assistance from 13 August until her own stocks ran low four days later. Relieved by Des Moines as flagship on 9 October, she returned to Boston on 24 October and entered the shipyard for overhaul. On 6 February 1954, Salem sailed again for Guantanamo Bay and returned on 7 April after refresher training. She left Boston on 30 April; and, on arrival in the Mediterranean on 12 May, again assumed duties as 6th Fleet flagship. Relieved by Des Moines at Lisbon on 22 September, she returned to Boston on 29 September. In October and November 1954, she participated in war games with the Atlantic Fleet. Between 19 January and 22 February 1955, Salem made her annual cruise to Guantanamo Bay for training. After a two-week reserve training cruise, the cruiser sailed for the Mediterranean on 2 May and relieved Newport News on 19 May. During this, her sixth deployment, she participated in a NATO exercise and a Franco- American naval exercise, with Under Secretary of the Navy Thomas S. Gates embarked as observer. Salem departed Barcelona on 23 September and returned to Boston on 2 October 1955 for a four-month overhaul. The cruiser left Boston on 16 February 1956 for training at Guantanamo in preparation for a 20-month cruise as \\"permanent\\" flagship of the Commander, 6th Fleet with homeport at Villefranche-sur-Mer. She returned to Boston on 5 April and sailed for the Mediterranean on 1 May. While she was at sea, the Suez Crisis broke out; and she was diverted to Rhodes in the Eastern Mediterranean where she joined the fleet on 14 May and assumed her flagship duties. She remained in the eastern Mediterranean until mid-June and returned when fighting broke out on 30 October. In April and August 1957, the 6th Fleet, by its presence in the eastern Mediterranean, twice showed United States support for the government of Jordan threatened by subversion. The cruiser departed the Mediterranean on 26 June 1958 and arrived at Norfolk on 4 July. Later uses Salem was used to portray the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee in the 1956 film The Battle of the River Plate, although the original German ship had a single triple gun turret placed forward of the superstructure where the Salem has two triple gun turrets forward of its superstructure. The original hull number of the Salem, 139, is also clearly visible in many exterior shots of Salem. These differences between the two ships were explained away in the movie by the historic fact that the ship's carpenters often camouflaged \\"Graf Spee\\" to resemble foreign vessels. (In this case, disguising \\"Graf Spee\\" as an American heavy cruiser.) In 1958, the cruiser arrived in Monaco to celebrate the birth of Albert II, born to Rainier III, Prince of Monaco and Princess Grace Kelly. Salem was scheduled for inactivation after her return from the Mediterranean, but the request of Lebanon on 15 August 1958 for aid against an anticipated coup led to a short reprieve for the cruiser. Salem had relieved on 11 August as flagship of Commander, 2nd Fleet; and, on 2 September, she departed Norfolk, visited Augusta Bay and Barcelona during a ten-day cruise in the Mediterranean, and returned to Norfolk on 30 September. She reported to the Norfolk Navy Yard on 7 October for inactivation, disembarked the Commander of the 2d Fleet on 25 October, and was decommissioned on 30 January 1959. She was stored as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The ship was surveyed in 1981 for possible reactivation as part of the 600 ship navy project, and while the inspection results showed she was in excellent condition, funding to reactivate Salem and her sister Des Moines could not be secured from Congress.  Museum ship  In October 1994, Salem was returned to her birthplace in Quincy, Massachusetts, where she is now a museum ship as part of the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum. Salem also houses the Museum, The US Navy Cruiser Sailors Association Museum, and the US Navy SEALs Exhibit room. The ship is also purported to be haunted and was even featured on Ghost Hunters. Salem was closed to tourists in September 2013 when the wharf to which she was moored became unstable. The wharf's former owner, the MBTA, forced the closure. Subsequently, the wharf was sold to private interests. Salem opened on weekends in May 2015. Scheduled since the wharf closure to be moved to a location in East Boston, the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum signed a deal with the landowner in February 2016 to keep Salem at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy until at least 2021 and is again open for visits on weekends starting April 2016. Salem was featured in the 2016 feature film The Finest Hours directed by Craig Gillespie. She served as the set of the tanker which broke in two off of Cape Cod on 15 February 1952 making for the most daring and notable United States Coast Guard search and rescues. Many machinery spaces and passageways were used for filming and can be spotted throughout the movie. In late 2016, USS Salem partnered with Ghost Ship Harbor to create a haunted attraction on the deck of the ship. The event was a fundraiser for USS Salem and saw thousands of people visit the ship during the month of October to see the haunted houses that were built. In 2017 Fodor's ranked it the scariest haunted house in Massachusetts. This event has since become an annual event on USS Salem. In August 2017 Salem was closed to the public while she was being relocated to a different pier in the shipyard. As of August 2019 she is open to the public on weekends.

Salem was featured as a haunted location on the paranormal TV series Most Terrifying Places which aired on the Travel Channel in 2019. The show featured tour guides and visitors who claimed to see the ghost of a former sailor who was badly burned in an explosion while onboard the U.S.S. Cleveland. He was brought aboard the Salem when it was docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and was used to transport the men who were injured in the fire to the medical bay.https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/most-terrifying-places/episodes/ship- of-anguished-spirits References External links   * World of Warships history and game model.

He was director-general of the BBC from 1960 to 1969. After working for newspapers in the 1930s, Greene spent most of his later career with the BBC, rising through the managerial ranks of overseas broadcasting and then news for the main domestic channels. He encountered opposition from some politicians and activists opposed to his modernising agenda, but under his leadership the BBC was recognised to be outperforming its commercial rival, ITV, and was awarded a second television channel (BBC 2) by the British government and authorised to introduce colour television to Britain. After retiring from the BBC, Greene published several books, including a collaboration with his brother, the novelist Graham Greene, and made television programmes both for the BBC and its commercial rival. Life and career Early years Greene, was born on 15 November 1910 in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, the youngest of four sons and the fifth of the six children of Charles Henry Greene, headmaster of Berkhamsted School, and his wife (and cousin), Marion Raymond, the daughter of the Rev Carleton Greene, vicar of Great Barford.Shaw, Colin. \\"Greene, Sir Hugh Carleton (1910–1987), journalist and broadcaster\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 22 March 2019. Among the couple's other children were Graham Greene, the novelist, and Raymond Greene, a Doctor of Medicine and a mountaineer. Greene was educated at Berkhamsted School and at Merton College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in classical moderations (1931) and English (1933). Before his undergraduate years at Merton, Greene had spent some time in Germany and, after graduating, he returned there, beginning his career as a journalist. He worked in Munich for the British publications The Daily Herald and the New Statesman, and in 1934 he joined the Berlin office of The Daily Telegraph, becoming its chief correspondent in 1938.\\"Greene, Sir Hugh (Carleton), (1910–19 Feb. 1987)\\", Who's Who & Who Was Who, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 22 March 2019 The writer of his entry in the Dictionary of National Biography, Colin Shaw, comments that Greene's direct witnessing of the Nazis deeply influenced him for the rest of his life, \\"teaching him to hate intolerance and the degradation of character to which the loss of freedom led\\". He was expelled from Germany in May 1939 in reprisal for the expulsion from London of a journalist and Nazi agent, Rudolf Rösel.\\"More Expulsions By Nazis\\", The Times, 4 May 1939, p. 16 The Daily Telegraph sent Greene to Warsaw but his time there was brief. In September 1939, the Germans invaded Poland and he was forced to leave. As the war spread in Europe he reported from Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, the Netherlands, Belgium and finally France, returning to Britain in June 1940, narrowly escaping the German army's arrival in Paris.\\"Sir Hugh Greene\\", The Times, 21 February 1987, p. 14 After a few months in the Royal Air Force as a pilot officer in intelligence, he was released to join the BBC's German service, becoming its news editor. Throughout the war the BBC remained committed to impartial and accurate reporting to enemy-occupied territories. 1945–1960 At the end of the war the British government asked Greene to return to Germany as controller of broadcasting in the British-occupied zone. He established a peacetime radio service, Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk, served as its first director-general and gave it a charter on the lines of the BBC. In 1948, the station was handed over to the German authorities and Greene returned to England. He was appointed head of the BBC's eastern European service in 1949, just before the Russians began to jam its broadcasts. In 1950, he was again seconded for government service, this time as head of emergency information services for the Federation of Malaya, helping to combat the efforts of communist insurgents. Among his assistants was the future prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kwan Yew, who became a close friend. On his return to London, Greene resumed his work at the BBC. First, in 1952, as assistant controller of overseas services, and then, in 1955, as controller.\\"News in Brief\\", The Times, 3 December 1954, p. 5 In 1956, Sir Norman Bottomley, director of administration and deputy to the director-general, Sir Ian Jacob, retired.\\"B.B.C. Appointments\\", The Times, 27 June 1956, p. 6Briggs, p. 115 Greene was appointed to succeed him; Shaw comments that this temporarily distanced him from any direct involvement with programmes, but clearly identified him as the potential successor to Jacob, who was due to retire in 1959. After two years Greene was appointed to a newly-created post – director of news and current affairs. It was established in the wake of television's rise to overtake radio as the dominant broadcasting medium, and Greene's brief was \\"to secure overall co-ordination and editorial direction of topical output in both radio and television\\". In this role Greene encountered resistance to modernisation by key figures in the BBC news division, headed by Tahu Hole. The commercial Independent Television News (ITN), launched in 1955 was strongly outperforming the BBC in innovation, flair and audience numbers. Jacob backed Greene's modernising approach, and moved Hole to be director of administration. Among the reforms introduced by Greene was the abandonment of a restrictive and bureaucratic system for covering party politics. Before the 1959 general election he announced, \\"We are going to cover the election, nationally and locally, like any other news story – on the basis of news value\\", putting the BBC on a similar basis to ITN and the press.\\"New B.B.C. Freedom In Election News\\", The Times, 18 September 1959, p. 14 BBC director-general Greene's appointment to succeed Jacob was announced in 1959. It was received with widespread approval by BBC staff, partly because Greene was the first director-general to have risen through the ranks of BBC management, and partly because his transformation of news and current affairs coverage had impressed the programme makers and made them feel valued as they had not felt previously. He assumed the post on 1 January 1960. Early on, Greene abolished the position of director of news and current affairs, and appointed himself editor-in-chief. In that capacity, Shaw writes, he remained \\"a working journalist capable, when the need arose, of dealing expeditiously with those editorial issues that were referred to him\\". As director-general he led a modernisation of the BBC, increasing its audience after the creation of a rival commercial ITV television network (the first contractors were on air from September 1955) which had become much more popular than the BBC. Soon after Greene's appointment, the government set up a committee of inquiry into broadcasting, chaired by the industrialist Sir Harry Pilkington. Greene pressed the BBC's case, arguing that the interests outside television of the commercial franchise holders constituted a conflict of loyalties with their public service obligations, and that the quality of programmes from commercial television was greatly inferior to that of the BBC's. The committee's report was highly favourable to Greene and the BBC, and despite pressure from the commercial television lobby, the government awarded the BBC the proposed third channel and introduction of colour television. In a short history of the corporation, the BBC says of Greene's tenure, \\"he encouraged programme-makers to reflect the social changes and attitudes of the Sixties\\": :After the arrival of That Was The Week That Was in 1962 ... the British Establishment would never be seen in the same light. ... Viewers enjoyed the portrayal of a new breed of gritty policemen in Z Cars (1962), wept at the plight of the homeless in The Wednesday Play, Cathy Come Home (1966) and were riveted by Doctor Who (1963), Top of the Pops (1964), Horizon (1964), Tomorrow's World (1965) and Dr Kildare, all attracting large audiences. ... Omnibus set a new standard for television arts programmes.\\"From Cathy Come Home to Doctor Who\\" , BBC. Retrieved 23 March 2019. Although under Greene's leadership the BBC caught up with and overtook commercial television in popularity among the British public as a whole, there were dissenting voices. Harold Wilson, who became prime minister in 1964, was less tolerant than his predecessors of the BBC's satire and lack of deference,Briggs, p. 548 and Mary Whitehouse, a campaigner who described herself as \\"an evangelical Christian and moral crusader\\", accused Greene of being \\"the devil incarnate\\" for allowing the broadcast of dramas with sexual content or bad language.\\"Mary Whitehouse\\" , The Daily Telegraph, 24 November 2001; and Anthony, Andrew. \\"Ban this Filth\\" , The Observer, 11 November 2012 Greene ignored Mary Whitehouse, but he was vulnerable to Wilson's hostility. When the chairman of the BBC, Lord Normanbrook, died in 1967, his successor Lord Hill, was appointed reportedly at Wilson's request. Hitherto chairman of the BBC's rival, the Independent Television Authority, whom Greene held then held in contempt.Tracey, Michael. \\"Greene, Mrs Whitehouse and the BBC\\", The Observer, 14 August 1983, pp. 21–22 If, as was suspected at the time, Wilson's motive was to provoke Greene into resigning, the ploy almost succeeded, but Greene's advisers convinced him that if he resigned the whole board of management of the BBC would resign with him, leaving the corporation \\"at the mercy of its new master\\" as one colleague put it. Greene and Hill established a working relationship that was uneasy but viable. Nonetheless, after a year Greene began to look forward to retirement. After more than eight years in post he left in March 1969. To make it clear that the decision was his, rather than Hill's, the latter proposed that Greene should become a member of the BBC's board of governors. He did so, and served for two years before resigning, feeling that his presence was inhibiting his successor. Later years After he left the post of director general, Greene made some programmes for the BBC and also – causing some disapproval at the BBC – for ITV. He edited several collections of stories about the rivals of Sherlock Holmes, collaborated with his brother Graham on Victorian Villanies (1984) and became chairman of Bodley Head, his brother's publisher. His lifelong hatred of totalitarianism and dictatorship led him to be active in campaigning against the military junta that ruled Greece after the coup of 1967. After civilian rule was reestablished, Greene was adviser to the Greek government on the constitution of broadcasting. Personal life Greene was married four times. In October 1934, he married Helga Mary (b. 1916), the daughter of Samuel Guinness, a banker, of London. They had two sons; the couple divorced in 1948. In September 1951, he married Elaine Shaplen (b. 1920), the daughter of Louis Gilbert, an accountant, of New York. They had two sons, and divorced in 1969. In May 1970, Greene married the German actress Tatjana Sais (1910–1981); they had lived together in the late 1940s. She died in 1981, and in December 1984, he married Sarah Mary Manning Grahame (b. 1941), a script supervisor from Australia. There were no children of the third and fourth marriages. Greene died from cancer in King Edward VII's Hospital, London, on 19 February 1987. Honours Greene was appointed OBE in 1950 and knighted (KCMG) in 1964. He received honorary degrees from the University of East Anglia, the University of York and the Open University. The West German government awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit in 1977. In 1985 he received the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honour from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation for outstanding work related to the promotion of scientific research and of learning, the arts and culture.

Initially associated with new wave, neo-psychedelia, and indie rock, their music later came to feature slower tempos and surreal soundscapes reminiscent of dream pop and post-rock. Glenn A. Baker has written that \\"From the release of the 'She Never Said' single in November 1980, this unique Sydney-originated entity has purveyed a distinctive, ethereal, psychedelic-tinged sound which has alternatively found favour and disfavour in Australia.\\"Glenn A. Baker, sleeve note to Of Skins and Heart EMI CD 8297652 The Los Angeles Times has described the band's music as \\"dense, shimmering, exquisite guitar pop\\".Quoted on back of sleeve, Of Skins and Heart EMI Cd 829652 The founding members were Steve Kilbey on lead vocals and bass guitar, Peter Koppes and Marty Willson- Piper on guitars, and Nick Ward on drums. Ward played only on their debut album, and the band's drummer for the rest of the 1980s was Richard Ploog. Jay Dee Daugherty (ex-Patti Smith Group) played drums from 1990 to 1993, followed by \\"timEbandit\\" Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians), who remains with them to the present day. Koppes left the band from 1992 to 1997, and Willson-Piper left in 2013. Ian Haug, formerly of Powderfinger, replaced him. Kilbey, Koppes, and Powles also recorded together as The Refo:mation in 1997. The Church's debut album, Of Skins and Heart (1981), delivered their first radio hit, \\"The Unguarded Moment\\", and they were signed to major labels in Australia, Europe, and the United States. However, the US label, dissatisfied with their second album, dropped the band without releasing it. This put a dent in their international success, but they returned to the charts in 1988 with the album Starfish and the US Top 40 hit \\"Under the Milky Way\\". Subsequent mainstream success has proved elusive, but the band retains a large international cult following and were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in Sydney in 2010. The Church continue to tour and record, releasing their 25th studio album, Man Woman Life Death Infinity, in October 2017. History 1980–1981: Early days, Of Skins and Heart Singer, songwriter, and bass guitarist Steve Kilbey first played with guitarist Peter Koppes in a glam rock band called Baby Grande in Canberra, Australia in the mid-1970s. After each had left to travel and play in other bands, including Tactics (Kilbey) and Limazine (Koppes), they met again in Sydney in March 1980 and formed the initial three- piece version of The Church, with Limazine drummer Nick Ward. The name was a shortened version of the original name proposed by Kilbey: \\"The Church of Man\\". A month later, Marty Willson-Piper, originally from Liverpool, United Kingdom, witnessed one of their gigs and met Kilbey afterwards. That same night he was invited to join the band on guitar, establishing the classic two- guitar formation. A four-song demo was recorded in Kilbey's bedroom studio and sent, through contacts from his and Koppes's old band Baby Grande, to the Australian branch of The Beatles' publishing company, ATV Northern Songs. The song \\"Chrome Injury\\" attracted the attention of managing director Chris Gilbey, who signed the band to his recently formed record production company, in association with EMI and their recently resurrected Parlophone label. Gilbey went to band rehearsals and helped shape their sound – he bought Willson-Piper a 12-string Rickenbacker guitar and equipped Koppes with an Echolette tape delay. Of that first batch of demos, only \\"Chrome Injury\\" would go on to be recorded for release. The band's debut album, Of Skins and Heart, was recorded late in 1980, produced by Gilbey and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Seven of the nine tracks were written solely by Kilbey and two co-written with others. The first single, \\"She Never Said\\", was released in November, but did not chart. At the start of 1981, Ward was replaced on drums by Richard Ploog. He was recruited by their manager, Michael Chugg, after hearing of his reputation in Adelaide. Ploog's arrival established The Church's first stable line-up. The second single, \\"The Unguarded Moment\\", co-written by Kilbey and Michelle Parker, was issued alongside the album in March 1981, but only in Australia initially. \\"The Unguarded Moment\\" became an Australian top forty hit, reaching No. 22 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, while Of Skins and Heart went gold, achieving the same position on the related Albums Chart. To promote the releases, the band undertook their first national tour. The first recordings with Ploog were released as a five-track double 7\\" EP, Too Fast for You, in July. It included the first collectively written track, \\"Sisters\\". Another track, \\"Tear It All Away\\", later released as a separate single, showed a development towards the more elaborate guitar structures which would become part of the band's signature sound. Their image and sound now evoked comparisons with 1960s psychedelic groups, with tight jeans, paisley shirts, and Byrds-style jangly guitars. Of Skins and Hearts commercial success enabled Gilbey to present the release to Freddie Cannon of French label Carrere and Rupert Perry of U.S. label Capitol. Both labels released the album in 1982, renaming it simply The Church and slightly altering the track listing to include songs from Too Fast for You and using a crop of that EP's artwork as the cover. The Church peaked at No. 7 in the New Zealand Albums Chart and No. 13 in Sweden. Ploog was incorrectly credited as the sole drummer on the release, despite only playing on one or three tracks, depending on the version. Capitol also released an edited single version of \\"The Unguarded Moment\\", without the band's approval. 1982–1985: The Blurred Crusade, Seance, Remote Luxury, Persia The band's second album, The Blurred Crusade, was issued in March 1982 and was both produced and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. Sonically and stylistically more complex than the debut, it is \\"a smoother, fuller release\\", which showed the clear influence of 1960s psychedelia. \\"With its mystical lyrics the second album ... brought the group's own style more into focus\\". The album peaked at No. 10 and its first single, \\"Almost With You\\" resulted in a second Top 30 hit, peaking at No. 21. The Church undertook a second Australian tour, while Carrere released the album in Europe, generating enough sales for them to tour there in October. However, Capitol declined to release The Blurred Crusade in North America and demanded that they write more radio-friendly material, as exemplified by their stable-mates Little River Band, which horrified the band. After another recording session, five new songs were offered to Capitol but the label was still unimpressed and dropped the band. The five songs were later released in Australia as the EP Sing-Songs, which reached the Top 100 Albums Chart in December. Meanwhile, their manager, Michael Chugg, arranged a U.K. tour supporting the hugely successful pop group Duran Duran, but after eight gigs The Church pulled out, feeling that audiences were unsympathetic. Chugg later recalled, \\"They were hard work. All four of them were strong-willed and had their own ideas of how things should be.\\" The band also toured Scandinavia and Europe in 1982, and both of their albums were released there to critical acclaim. In May 1983, the band released their third album, Seance, co-produced by The Church and engineer John Bee (Hoodoo Gurus, Icehouse, The Divinyls), which peaked at No. 18. It used more keyboards and synthesizers and was typically described as \\"That stark release [which] explored the band's darker side, and [whose] tracks ... were awash with strings and other effects\\". The accompanying live shows included a guest keyboardist, Melbourne-based session player Dean Walliss. For Seance, the band employed mixing engineer Nick Launay, who had worked with Midnight Oil. He favoured a gated reverb drum sound, popular in the 1980s, which produced a staccato-like snare sound. Unsatisfied with this, the band asked Launay to redo the mix, but the effect was only lightened. The first single, \\"Electric Lash\\", featured this effect especially prominently and it was likened to a \\"machine gun\\". Despite dissatisfaction over the mix, Seance featured a lusher, more atmospheric sound with highlights including \\"Now I Wonder Why\\" and \\"Fly\\". Internationally, the album sold poorly, being considered dark and cryptic, and the general public seemed to lose interest. Some critics in Europe and the U.S. did like the album however, with Creem hailing the band as \\"one of the best in the world\\". Seance was again dominated by Kilbey's songwriting. Some 20 songs were put together on his home 4-track. Only one band composition made the album: the experimental \\"Travel by Thought\\". Kilbey and Willson-Piper had co-written another track, \\"10,000 Miles\\", but the label rejected it. Kilbey was upset by the label's interference, finding the track essential to their live set (it would be included on their next EP). Despite the difficulties, the album yielded two minor hits - \\"It's No Reason\\" and \\"Electric Lash\\" - and stayed in the British independent charts for several months. The group had built a devoted fan base with their paisley shirts, catchy melodies, and solid live performances. Following the release of Seance, they toured Australia and New Zealand for the rest of the year to pay off debts incurred on the European tour. Meanwhile, Capitol Records released their first album in Canada, where it reached the Top 20. The Sing-Songs EP also became one of the bestselling Canadian imports of 1983. Forgoing a full album, the band released two EPs in 1984, Remote Luxury in March and Persia in August, but only in Australia and New Zealand. Both EPs reached the Top 50 on the Australian Albums Chart. Again, almost all tracks were written by Kilbey, but compared to Seance, the atmosphere was lighter and less gloomy. The band's trademark guitar sound was complemented by the keyboards of guest musicians Davey Ray Moor (from The Crystal Set, which included Kilbey's brother Russell) and Craig Hooper (from The Reels), who joined as an auxiliary member. Hooper soon left to form The Mullanes. The band then signed to Warner Bros. Records in the United States. Internationally, the two EPs were repackaged as a single album titled Remote Luxury. Its U.S. release was their first record there since the debut album – although The Blurred Crusade and Seance had sold well on import. Due to the interest raised in the U.S., they left Michael Chugg Management in Sydney and signed with Malibu Management's owner John Lee. They toured the US in October and November and while venues in New York and Los Angeles saw audiences of about 1,000 people, other gigs had as few as 50. In financial terms, the tour went poorly and the band lost thousands of dollars a week. The Church seemed to reach a nadir in 1984. Unable to repeat the commercial success of the first two albums, there was a perception that their creativity was declining. Kilbey later said: \\"I think we released a few dud records that weren't as good as they should have been, after The Blurred Crusade ... The band was just drifting along in a sea of apathy, I was writing not-so-good songs and the band wasn't playing them very well, so everyone's enthusiasm just waned\\". The start of 1985 was quiet for the band as members spent time apart in Stockholm, Sydney, and Jamaica. Kilbey's debut solo single, \\"This Asphalt Eden\\", was released by EMI Parlophone and he was also the producer on the single \\"Benefit of the Doubt\\" for The Crystal Set. 1985–1988: Heyday, Starfish Steve Kilbey, California, 1986 The Church reconvened at Studios 301 in mid-1985 to work on their next album, Heyday, with British producer/engineer Peter Walsh (Simple Minds, Scott Walker, Peter Gabriel). Their first single in almost two years, \\"Already Yesterday\\", appeared in October and just made the Top 100. Heyday followed in November and brought new stylistic elements with the addition of real strings and horns, creating a warm, organic sound. The songs \\"were among the richest moments in The Church canon\\". While Kilbey still wrote the lyrics, the band were now largely writing the music together, a practice which they would continue thereafter. Released in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the US, the album was warmly received. In Australia, it peaked at No. 19, and it also appeared on the U.S. Billboard 200. A promotional tour started in April 1986, with concerts both at home and abroad. Unexpectedly, Willson-Piper suddenly quit mid-tour after rising in-band tensions and on 10 July, The Church performed as a three-piece in Hamburg, Germany. Willson-Piper returned within a week after Kilbey agreed that future releases would contain more group efforts. Despite the charged atmosphere and warm press, low sales for the album's singles in Australia prompted EMI to drop them. Plans for a double live album, Bootleg, were also scrapped. Since the band had greater sales overseas than in Australia, they decided to record in a studio abroad and opted for a four-album deal with U.S. label Arista Records in 1987. For Australian releases they signed with Mushroom Records. Recording sessions in Los Angeles, with producers Waddy Wachtel (Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Robbie Williams) and Greg Ladanyi (Warren Zevon, Jackson Browne, Fleetwood Mac), were a new challenge according to Kilbey: \\"It was Australian hippies versus West Coast guys who know the way they like to do things. We were a bit more undisciplined than they would have liked\\". Personality clashes occurred as the two sides bickered over guitar sounds, song structures, and work ethic. Under pressure from the producers, Kilbey took vocal lessons, an experience he later regarded as valuable. The stress of living in the US influenced their recording, and left Kilbey feeling out of place: Album tracks such as \\"North, South, East and West,\\" \\"Lost,\\" \\"Reptile\\", and \\"Destination\\" bore the imprint of the faces, scenery, and daily life of the group's new, temporary home. Four weeks of gruelling rehearsals resulted in Starfish, which focused on capturing the band's core sound. Bright, spacious, and uncluttered, the recording was a departure from the layered orchestrations of Heyday. The group wanted as live and dynamic an album as possible; Willson-Piper said that trying to record a live atmosphere lacked a real gig's sense of \\"being there\\". They found the results bare and simplistic; however, the public reception was unexpected. Released in April 1988, Starfish found its way into the mainstream, marking a new worldwide commercial peak for the band. It reached No. 11 in Australia and the Top 50 in the US. The album was awarded a gold record in December 1992 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Also released in February, the single \\"Under the Milky Way\\" reached #24 on the US Hot 100, #22 in Australia, and entered the Canadian Top 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks. The song was written by Kilbey and then-girlfriend Karin Jansson (ex-Pink Champagne). A near five-minute video received airtime on music television programs. \\"Under the Milky Way\\" won an ARIA Award in 1989 for 'Single of the Year'. In 2008, readers of The Australian voted it the best Australian song of the last 20 years. In response, Kilbey said, \\"it's not really about anything at all. I just wanted to create an atmosphere and I didn't even put a lot of thought into that. History has given it something that it never really had\\". A second single from Starfish, \\"Reptile\\", charted on the Australian Top 100 in August and Billboard Mainstream charts. EMI responded with a double compilation album, Hindsight 1980-1987, which contained selections from the band's prior albums, together with hitherto- uncollected singles and B-sides. It peaked in the ARIA Top 40 Albums Chart in July. 1989–1992: Gold Afternoon Fix, Priest=Aura The Church promoted Starfish with a nine-month tour before they returned to the studio for a follow-up. With a US Top 50 album under their belt, there was pressure from Arista to create another. The band started negotiations with former Led Zeppelin bass guitarist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, who had a reputation as a sophisticated producer, but the record company and management vetoed their suggestion. In an attempt to duplicate the success of Starfish, The Church returned to Los Angeles, with Waddy Wachtel producing. While the prior sessions were tense, these were volatile. Already unenthusiastic about the forced pairing, there was the stress of having to create another hit album, and this took its toll. All members were outspoken about the role that drugs played in The Church’s creative process, but drummer Richard Ploog began to retreat further into his own habit as pressure increased. The number of attempted studio takes spiralled and Ploog's relationship with Kilbey deteriorated, accentuated by Wachtel's demands for a consistently reliable tempo. Eventually, Ploog's isolation led to exclusion and his drum tracks were replaced by rigid, but meter-perfect, programmed drums on all but three tracks. He left the band after the sessions. The resulting album, Gold Afternoon Fix, while different from its predecessor, reached No.12 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart. While Starfish focused on a raw, live sound, Gold Afternoon Fix employed more ambient aspects including piano, acoustic guitars, and keyboards. On some tracks, the music was punctuated by clanging metal, rustling wind, or sharp, industrial sounds. Gold Afternoon Fix was heavily backed by a promotional campaign from Arista and the band went on tour, hiring Patti Smith's drummer, Jay Dee Daugherty. The album spawned a hit single, \\"Metropolis\\" (No. 19 in Australia, No. 11 on U.S. Mainstream Rock), but the follow-up, \\"You're Still Beautiful\\", did not chart. Ultimately, the album's sales were lower than Starfish's and press was mixed. The band, particularly Kilbey, would later dismiss the album as \\"lousy\\", \\"hashed together\\", and \\"hideous\\", although many of the songs have since become fixtures in the band's setlists. After the dust had settled on Gold Afternoon Fix, The Church returned to their old haunt at Sydney's Studios 301 to commence work on their next album. With lowered commercial expectations and less pressure from Arista, the atmosphere was more relaxed. Bringing in British producer Gavin MacKillop (Barenaked Ladies, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Straitjacket Fits) to supervise the sessions, the band began to improvise the framework for the next set of songs. The use of opium and, for Kilbey, heroin, saw the material take on a more expansive and surreal quality, while Daugherty's jazzier approach on drums was a fresh change. Priest=Aura, titled from Kilbey's misreading of a Spanish fan's English vocabulary notes ('priest' = 'cura'), contains fourteen songs, many over six minutes long, and was their longest album yet at 65 minutes. With song concepts derived from cryptic, one- word working titles (an idea originally proposed by Willson-Piper), the lyrics leaned towards the abstract and esoteric. Emphasizing free association and undirected coincidence between music and motif, Kilbey declined to define their meanings. Sonically, the music had numerous layers, courtesy of numerous guitar overdubs and MacKillop's rich production. The interplay between Koppes and Willson-Piper dominated throughout, especially on tracks such as \\"Ripple,\\" \\"Kings,\\" and the epic, aptly titled \\"Chaos\\", whose lyrics were a reflection of Steve Kilbey's unsettled lifestyle at the time. Upon its release on 10 March 1992, Priest=Aura was given a mixed reception. It peaked in the ARIA Top 30, but reviews were varied, with some critical and others uncertain how to react. The band only went on a limited tour, confined to Australia, as Kilbey prepared for the birth of his twin daughters with Karin Jansson. Adding to the decline in The Church's outlook was the announcement of Koppes' departure. His decision reflected two main factors: that the band had earned nothing for the two-week tour of Australia, and that he felt shut out of the creative process - a long-standing complaint that stretched back at least as far as Seance, if not further.Robert Dean Lurie. No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and The Church. Portland OR: Verse Chorus press, 2009, p. 219 Despite a completely sold-out tour, increasing personality conflicts within the band and frustration over their lack of success had made the situation intolerable. Despite its muted reception at the time of release, Priest=Aura is considered by both the band and fan base to be an artistic high point. In his 2014 autobiography, Something Quite Peculiar, Kilbey calls it their \\"undisputed masterpiece\\". 1993–1996: Sometime Anywhere, Magician Among the Spirits Despite the loss of Koppes, Arista decided to stand by the band's contract and back another Church album, and so Kilbey and Willson-Piper began to write new material. When it became clear that Daugherty would not be returning to the fold either, the remaining two took the opportunity to approach their music from new perspectives, abandoning their long-established roles and stylistic elements in favour of experimentation, spontaneity, and electronica. Early in 1994, the two brought in Willson-Piper's childhood friend Andy 'Dare' Mason to produce, record, and mix. The album was mostly recorded at Sydney's Karmic Hit Studios and mixed at Karmic Hit and Studios 301. New Zealand drummer Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians) was hired for the sessions, having already played with Kilbey on his Jack Frost project. Considered temporary at the time, Powles would soon become a permanent member of the band and is still with them over 20 years later. The resulting album, Sometime Anywhere, released in May 1994, was generally well received and peaked in the Top 30. It is described as a \\"rich, dark, epic release [which] picked up where Priest left off with lush, lengthy tracks\\". Sales, however, were paltry and the first single, \\"Two Places at Once\\", did not chart. Promotion was minimal as Arista saw insufficient commercial promise in the release. With another commercially unsuccessful album on their hands, Arista did not renew The Church's contract and pulled financial support for a tour. Ambitious plans to stage full electric shows were scaled back, leaving Kilbey and Willson-Piper with only a short run of acoustic gigs as a duo. Without a recording deal, the band's future looked bleak as Kilbey and Willson-Piper began work on new recordings in 1995. Although initially a two-man project, the new material saw input from new drummer Powles and hired violinist Linda Neil. Renewed contact between Kilbey and Peter Koppes led to the latter agreeing to guest on four songs - a welcome surprise for fans. Simon Polinski (Yothu Yindi) was drafted in to co-produce, engineer, and mix the sessions. The music saw a return to guitar-based material, infused with krautrock and art rock influences. A 15-minute atmospheric piece called \\"Magician Among the Spirits\\" dominated the sessions, named after a book by Harry Houdini. Additional contributions by Utungun Percussion added a new, primal aspect to several songs. The album, also called Magician Among the Spirits, received mixed reviews, despite the guitar rock hook of its single \\"Comedown\\". It was released on the band's own Deep Karma label, but due to financial constraints, they had to arrange outside distribution for the North American and European markets. This almost doomed the album from the beginning, but worse events were to come. Within a short time, the U.S. distributor went bankrupt, leaving the band stripped of its earnings from North American sales. Although exact figures remain unknown due to disputes, up to A$250,000 worth of merchandise (some 25,000 discs) was lost. For a band already on shaky ground, this was nearly the death knell. Comments by Kilbey in May of that year summed up the situation: \\"There's no immediate future for The Church.....Our management, the whole thing is broken down.....We don't really have a label. We're owed lots and lots of money and we're broke. We're trying to pursue lawyers to get our money back. Marty and I aren't having any communication. There's no one really managing us so.....that could have been the last record.\\" 1997–1999: The Refo:mation, Hologram of Baal, A Box of Birds Following the commercial failure of Magician Among the Spirits, the members of The Church turned their attention to other projects and Willson-Piper left Australia again in order to collaborate with other artists and write new solo material. In his absence, Kilbey, Powles, and Koppes spent some studio time together and quickly wrote and recorded an album as The Refo:mation, utilizing Powles also as a mix engineer. Loose in feel but rich in atmosphere, the eccentrically-titled Pharmakoi/Distance-Crunching Honchos with Echo Units saw a greater focus on concise, guitar-dominated songs, in contrast to the experimentation of Magician Among the Spirits. Group tensions within The Church proper were still simmering, however. More than anyone else, it was new drummer Tim Powles who tried to alleviate the outstanding disagreements. While Koppes and Willson-Piper had already had differences for some time, Kilbey and Willson-Piper's relationship was also strained by recent problems. Kilbey declared that the end was nigh: after a final, worthy swan song, with the working title Au Revoir Por Favor, the Church would be put to rest. The four agreed to play a string of farewell concerts around Australia, which turned out to be extremely successful. The roaring success of the intended \\"final concert\\" in Sydney put a quick end to talk of the band's demise. The results of the new recording sessions saw a return to the band's roots: the material was once again based around Koppes and Willson-Piper's guitar interplay. Also, for the first time, the band completely produced the work themselves, under Powles' aegis. Originally given the name Bastard Universe, the forthcoming album was re-titled Hologram of Allah after Willson-Piper found the original too negative. Concerns about fundamentalist Muslim reaction to the potentially blasphemous title made the band finally opt for the more neutral Hologram of Baal, after the Canaanite god. Released under a new contract with UK independent label Cooking Vinyl, the album was distributed in the U.S. by Thirsty Ear. A limited edition featured a bonus disc with a nearly 80-minute continuous improvised instrumental, which received the original title of the album, Bastard Universe. The reformed and rejuvenated band went on their first fully electric tour of the U.S., Australia, and Europe in many years. A plan to release a live album called Bag of Bones was put into motion, but then cancelled. Instead, a collection of cover songs was recorded in Sweden, shedding light on the band's influences. Arriving in August 1999 - less than a year after Hologram of Baal - A Box of Birds contained an unusual selection of songs from Ultravox and Iggy Pop to The Monkees and Neil Young. The insert for the CD was designed as interchangeable, with 10 separate sleeve designs created by fans. As with Hologram of Baal, a tour followed the album's release, but new drama hit the band mid-tour in New York City when Kilbey was arrested for trying to purchase heroin. The band was forced to improvise a set after he failed to show, with Willson-Piper covering vocals. A night in jail and a day's community service on the Manhattan subway were Kilbey's only punishment. \\"A drug bust is something every aging rock star should have under his belt\\", he was later quoted as saying. 2000–2007: After Everything Now This, Forget Yourself, Uninvited, Like the Clouds In 2001, \\"Under the Milky Way\\" was featured in the film Donnie Darko, helping to raise the band's profile once again. However, recording for their next album turned out to be painstakingly slow due to numerous side projects and simple geography. With Kilbey now living in Sweden, Willson-Piper in England, and the others in Australia, the bandmates met across several separate sessions. Partially recorded in Sweden, NYC, and Australia, the resulting After Everything Now This, released in January 2002, saw a focus on the softer elements of the band, with responsibility for production and final mixing again resting on Powles. With only three obvious \\"rock\\" tracks out of ten, gentler moods dominated. The album achieved the biggest international success for The Church in almost ten years. The successive world tour featured the band in a more subtle setting as well, with most tracks performed primarily acoustically alongside guest David Lane on piano. Fans would not have to wait long for another group release. The double-disc remix/outtakes set Parallel Universe hit stores in late 2002. Unique among the band's catalogue, the first disc, subtitled \\"remixture\\", featured a reshuffled, remixed, electronic version of the After Everything Now This album, the result of Tim Powles' collaboration with Sydney EDM musicians. The second disc, subtitled \\"mixture\\", compiled leftover songs from the After Everything Now This recording sessions. Around the time that Parallel Universe was released, the Church had returned to the studio to record yet another album, eventually titled Forget Yourself. Rather than fleshing the songs out over a long, gradual process, the band decided to keep the music as close to the original jam-based material as possible. Stylistically, this made for a much rawer sound, primarily recorded live and with minimal overdubs. As had become routine since Sometime Anywhere, songs saw numerous instrument changes between members, with Powles playing lead guitar on \\"Sealine\\",\\"Maya\\", and \\"Reversal\\", and Willson-Piper switching to drums on \\"Maya\\". Forget Yourself was engineered and co-produced by Nic Hard and was released in Australia in October 2003 and in the U.S. in February 2004. The band toured extensively to support the album in Australia, the U.S., and Europe. Their prolific output continued into 2004 with the release of three ancillary albums. Under the guidance of manager Kevin Lane Keller - an American fan and marketing professor who had been working with the band since 2001 - the Church began capitalizing on the advantages offered by the internet and the independent music industry. First, in August, came the entirely improvised album Jammed, containing just two long tracks and available exclusively from the band's website. Next, in October, came their third outtakes album, Beside Yourself, covering the Forget Yourself sessions. Finally, only six weeks later, came El Momento Descuidado, in which the band presented old and new material in an acoustic setting, for the Liberation Blue label. The title was a rough tongue- in-cheek translation of \\"The Unguarded Moment\\", a version of which was included. A short acoustic tour followed in late 2004, which initiated a new practice amongst the band members: that of swapping instruments on stage. The album was eventually nominated in 2005 for \\"Best Adult Contemporary Album\\" at the Australian ARIA Music Awards, although it did not win. Park West, Chicago, 18 August 2006 In 2005, The Church returned to full electric mode and began work on new material once again. The first release from these sessions was the outtakes album Back with Two Beasts, released via their website as a teaser for the main album which would follow a few months later. Back with Two Beasts has over time come to have a \\"main\\" album life of its own, with tracks being featured on Apple music and the like, being seen by many fans as the band at its fluid and fresh artistic best. Uninvited, Like the Clouds, their 20th studio album, was released to rapturous reviews in April 2006 and was followed once again by extensive touring in Europe, the U.S., and Australia. Just before its release, in March, they performed \\"Under the Milky Way\\" with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra as part of the 2006 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. In February 2007 came El Momento Siguiente, a second album of acoustic re-interpretations of earlier songs plus several new compositions and a cover version of The Triffids classic \\"Wide Open Road\\". Later that year, the band toured Australia with The Pretenders and EMI released the double CD 'best of' collection Deep in the Shallows - The Classic Singles Collection. 2008–2011: Shriek, Untitled #23, ARIA Hall of Fame induction, 30th anniversary In 2006, The Church had embarked on their third improvised music project: to provide the soundtrack for a short film based on the renowned American science fiction writer Jeff Vandermeer's novel Shriek: An Afterword. The music was released in 2008 as the album Shriek: Excerpts from the Soundtrack, and was the first release on their new label, Unorthodox Records, a partnership with MGM Distribution. In February 2009, the band began the build-up to their next major studio album with the Coffee Hounds EP, which featured the original, non-album composition \\"The Coffee Song\\", and a cover of Kate Bush's classic \\"Hounds of Love\\". The following month they released the Pangaea EP, whose title track would also be on the upcoming album. Unorthodox Records released the album Untitled#23 in Australia in March and the U.S. label Second Motion Records released it to the rest of the world shortly thereafter. Recorded at Powles' Spacejunk III Studios by engineer/artist Jorden Brebach, who mixed many of the tracks, a double vinyl version quickly sold out. It was the band's 23rd album-length Australian release of original studio material, while Kilbey also alluded to the mystical significance of the number 23 in an interview with music publication Music Feeds. Another major international tour followed, the \\"So Love May Find Us\\" tour, named after a non-album track from the Pangaea EP. Coinciding with the tour, a book entitled No Certainty Attached: Steve Kilbey and The Church by Robert Dean Lurie was published in Australia, the US, and the UK by Verse Chorus Press. While primarily a biography of Kilbey, the book also traced the evolution of the band from his perspective. This was not an official band project but Kilbey, Koppes, and various friends and family members did participate. On 27 November 2009, the Church released another EP, Operetta. The title track was taken from Untitled #23 but the remaining tracks, including the 34-minute improvisation \\"Particles Matter\\", were unique to this release. In February 2010, the band announced that they would be celebrating their 30th anniversary with an acoustic tour entitled \\"An Intimate Space\\". In a unique programme, the band chose one song from each of their many albums and performed them in reverse chronological order. The shows included a 28-page program and the Deadman's Hand EP, which included more unreleased material from the Untitled #23 sessions, and some tracks specifically shaped by Powles for the release. The U.S. leg of the tour spanned April and May, including a performance of \\"Under the Milky Way\\" on KUSI News in San Diego. In October, Second Motion Records re-released six early Church albums in the U.S., with bonus tracks and extensive liner notes by Willson-Piper, along with the Deep in the Shallows singles collection. On 27 October 2010, The Church were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame by media commentator George Negus, while young pop singer Washington performed \\"The Unguarded Moment\\". After their acceptance speech, the band performed \\"Under the Milky Way\\" and \\"Tantalized\\". In November and December, they continued with the Australian leg of their \\"An Intimate Space\\" tour. The band travelled to the U.S. once again in February 2011 in full electric mode for the \\"Future Past Perfect\\" tour, performing three albums in their entirety: Untitled#23, Priest=Aura, and Starfish. Sold-out dates were played in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Alexandria, Philadelphia, New York, Foxborough, and Atlanta. This tour was the first on which the band was augmented onstage by the Australian multi-instrumentalist Craig Wilson, from the band ASTREETLIGHTSONG. On 10 April, The Church further celebrated their 30th anniversary with a special show entitled \\"A Psychedelic Symphony\\" at the Sydney Opera House, which had been a year in preparation. Accompanied by conductor George Ellis and the George Ellis Symphony Orchestra, the concert was performed to a sold-out 2,000+ capacity crowd and was recorded and filmed. A DVD and double CD were released by Unorthodox in June 2014, the band's first official live album. The show was also broadcast on the Australian music TV channel MAX during October 2011. In December, they concluded the \\"Future Past Perfect\\" tour with a dozen Australian dates. Their show of 17 December at the Enmore Theatre, Sydney, was filmed and is available to stream here. 2012 onward: Royalty dispute, Willson-Piper's departure, Further/Deeper, Man Woman Life Death Infinity, Koppes' departure In November and December 2012, The Church played a major series of concerts across Australia and New Zealand, together with Simple Minds, Devo, and Models. As part of the tour, they also played several \\"A Day on the Green\\" events with Models. During this tour, they also played two intimate \\"Art Rock 'n' Roll\\" shows, one at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne and the other at the Factory Theatre in Sydney, where each member chose four songs from the band's catalogue, interspersed with a selection of concert staples. In March 2013, there were the outward signs of internal problems in the band when Steve Kilbey issued a series of statements which indicated that he was considering leaving The Church due to a dispute over royalty payments. Then, later in the year, Kilbey announced on the band's Facebook page that Marty Willson-Piper would not be returning and had been replaced by former Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug. Kilbey explained that Willson-Piper was \\"not available\\" for the recording of a new album and subsequent touring, and praised Haug as \\"a brilliant guitarist\\". Kilbey also provided a pre-emptive response to disgruntled fans: \\"... if you can't dig it I'm sorry. this is my fucking band after all and it has existed at times without Peter and in the beginning without Marty.\\" In early October 2014, Kilbey explained that Willson-Piper was not asked to leave the band but that he had simply not replied to the various attempts made to contact him. Realizing that Willson-Piper would not respond, and in agreement with Powles at the time, Kilbey said \\"Yes, we have to find someone with stature. He has to have his own trip, he can’t be some weedy little guy coming in to play guitar. It has to be somebody with experience and gravitas.\\" As part of the same interview, Haug explained that he had received a phone call from Kilbey while he was returning home from a funeral. Without first greeting Haug, Kilbey simply asked, \\"If I asked you to join The Church, what would you say?\\" and ended the call after Haug's affirmative, but bewildered, response. Haug said that joining the Church was the \\"last thing\\" that would have entered his mind, but that \\"it just really seemed to work\\". Entitled Further/Deeper, the Church's 24th studio album was released on 17 October 2014. Recorded over a period of eight days in late 2013, Further/Deeper was produced and engineered by Powles. Writing for the Courier-Mail, Noel Mengel rated the album with 4.5 stars, while Jeff Apter assigned the album 4 stars in Rolling Stone Australia. The band performed the album in its entirety during the \\"Further/Deeper\\" tours of Australia, then headed to North America and Europe, with a guest spot and select shows at SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas, and then a career-defining set on one of the prestigious PrimaVera festival's main stages in Barcelona, Spain. In July, August, and September 2015, the band toured Australia, finishing at Splendour in the Grass festival, and then going to the U.S. again, co-headlining with The Psychedelic Furs on most of these dates. On this tour, at select headline side shows, the band played most of Further/Deeper plus The Blurred Crusade in their entirety. Upon arriving back in Australia, they headlined the boutique Small World Festival in Sydney's Newtown neighbourhood. In 2016, the band returned to the U.S. again twice, first for a more comprehensive headline tour playing The Blurred Crusade in its entirety and including an invite to the main stage with The Flaming Lips and Young Fathers at Mavericks Festival in San Antonio, Texas. Then, in July, they toured the USA again, repeating the success of 2015 by once again sharing larger venues with The Psychedelic Furs. 2017 brought the recording and release of The Church's 25th album, Man Woman Life Death Infinity. It was released on 6 October and was preceded by two singles, the album opener \\"Another Century\\" and the fourth track, \\"Undersea\\". About the album, Steve Kilbey commented, \\"This is The Church's water record. I've always marveled at the seas, rivers, and rain. It wasn't conscious at all, but on reflection, it definitely is a preoccupation on this record.\\" The band toured North America in September and October before returning home to Australia for a string of dates in November and December. On 1 February 2020, Steve Kilbey announced on Facebook that Peter Koppes had departed the group, and that touring member Jeffrey Cain had been promoted to full member status, with Even guitarist Ashley Naylor also being brought into the lineup. Also in early 2020, their official webpage has them working on a new album tentatively titled \\"In the Wake of the Zeitgeist\\".

It consisted of twelve people who together regulated the BBC and represented the interests of the public. It existed from 1927 until it was replaced by the BBC Trust on 1 January 2007. The governors were independent of the Director-General and the rest of the BBC's executive team. They had no direct say in programme-making, but were nevertheless accountable to Parliament and to licence fee payers for the BBC's actions. Although a 'state broadcaster', the BBC is theoretically protected from government interference due to the statutory independence of its governing body. The Governors' role was to appoint the Director-General (and in earlier years, other key BBC staff). They approved strategy and policy, set objectives, oversaw complaints, and produced Annual Reports that documented the BBC's performance and compliance each year. The role of chairman of the Board of Governors, though a non executive, was one of the most important positions in British media. Appointments Governors were usually appointed from senior positions in various walks of British society. Appointments were part-time positions and lasted for four (formerly five) years. Four governors were given specific responsibilities: for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English regions. Governors were nominally appointed by the monarch on the advice of ministers. In practice, governors were chosen by the government of the day. This has led to claims of political interference, in particular during the years of Margaret Thatcher's premiership. Controversy The Thatcher government appointed a succession of governors with the apparent intent of bringing the BBC \\"into line\\" with government policy. Marmaduke Hussey was appointed chairman of the Board of Governors apparently with the specific agenda of bringing down the then-Director-General Alasdair Milne; this government also broke the tradition of always having a trade union leader on the Board of Governors. BBC director general Mark Thompson said \\"staff were “quite mystified” by the rise of Margaret Thatcher but that there was “less overt tribalism” among its journalists. It has also been suggested that Harold Wilson's appointment of the former Tory minister Lord Hill as chairman of the Board of Governors in 1967 was motivated by a desire to undermine the radical, questioning agenda of Director-General Sir Hugh Greene – ironically Wilson had attacked the appointment of Hill as Chairman of the Independent Television Authority by a Conservative government in 1963. In January 2004 Gavyn Davies, who had been appointed chairman of the Board of Governors by the Labour government in 2001, resigned in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry. Lord Ryder of Wensum, previously a Conservative Member of Parliament and a member of Margaret Thatcher's personal staff, replaced him as Acting Chairman. It has been claimed that Ryder and other Conservatives on the Board of Governors were effectively responsible for \\"forcing out\\" Director-General Greg Dyke, who had not initially believed that his offer of resignation would be accepted by the Governors. In May 2004, Michael Grade took over as permanent chairman. He was to be the last permanent chairman of the Board of Governors.

Under the terms of the Act, the railway network, long- distance road haulage and various other types of transport were nationalised and handed over to a new British Transport Commission for operation. The commission was responsible to the Ministry of Transport for general transport policy, which it exercised principally through financial control of a number of executives set up to manage specified sections of the industry under schemes of delegation. Overview The Act was part of the nationalisation agenda of Clement Attlee's Labour government, and took effect from 1 January 1948. In Northern Ireland, the Ulster Transport Authority acted in a similar manner. The government also nationalised other means of transport such as: canals, sea and shipping ports, bus companies, and eventually, in the face of much opposition, road haulage. All of these transport modes, including British Railways, were brought under the control of a new body, the British Transport Commission (BTC). The BTC was a part of a highly ambitious scheme to create a publicly owned, centrally planned, integrated transport system. In theory, the BTC was to co-ordinate different modes of transport, to co-operate and supplement each other instead of competing. This was to be achieved by means of fare and rate adjustments. In practice, very little integration between modes ever materialised. Section 5 of the Act provided for the setting up of a number of executives within the BTC: the Railway Executive; the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive; the Road Transport Executive; and the London Transport Executive were to be created immediately, with the Hotels Executive to be set up at a later date. The same section allowed the number and names of these executives to be varied as necessary. Road transport The road haulage industry bitterly opposed nationalisation, and found allies in the Conservative Party. Once the Conservatives were elected in 1951, road haulage was soon privatised and deregulated, but the railways and buses remained regulated, and were left under the control of the British Transport Commission. Railways After the Second World War, the Big Four railway companies of the grouping era were effectively bankrupt, and the Act was intended to bring about some stability in transport policy. As part of that policy, British Railways was established to run the railways. (The Transport Act 1948 later transferred the lines in Northern Ireland formerly of the LMS, the Northern Counties Committee, to the Ulster Transport Authority.) Shares in the railway companies were exchanged for British Transport Stock, with a guaranteed 3% return chargeable to the BTC, and were repayable after forty years. The level of compensation paid has proved to be a matter of historical controversy. Some commentators, including The Economist and the London Stock Exchange stated that because the government based the levels of compensation for former railway shareholders on the valuation of their shares in 1946 (when the whole railway infrastructure was in a run-down and dilapidated state because of war damage and minimal maintenance) the railways were acquired comparatively cheaply. However, others point out that three of the Big Four were effectively bankrupt before the onset of war in 1939 and were only saved from the ignominy of actually declaring bankruptcy by the guaranteed income provided by the wartime government and the temporary surge in rail traffic caused by the restrictions on other forms of transport during and immediately after the war. The exchange of potentially worthless private stock for government gilts based on a valuation during an artificially created boom could thus be considered a very good deal. Despite nationalisation and the creation of British Railways (BR), the rail system changed little, and was left in much the same way as it had been before nationalisation. BR was divided into six administrative regions: Eastern, London Midland, North Eastern, Scottish, Southern and Western. These closely mirrored the regions covered by the former companies in England and Wales, although with the addition of a separate Scottish Region. The North Eastern Region was eventually amalgamated with the Eastern Region, reflecting the English operations of the 1923–1947 London and North Eastern Railway. Transport Act 1962 Fifteen years later, under the Transport Act 1962, Harold Macmillan's Conservative government dissolved the British Transport Commission and created the British Railways Board to take over railway duties from 1 January 1963 and the Transport Holding Company to take over bus operations from the same date.

Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of sport competition using video games. Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events. The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, card games, battle royales, and real-time strategy (RTS). Popular esport franchises include League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Overwatch, Super Smash Bros., and StarCraft, among many others. Tournaments such as the League of Legends World Championship, Dota 2 International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters are among the most popular in esports. Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored teams, such as the Overwatch League. Although the legitimacy of esports as a true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia, with the International Olympic Committee also having discussed their inclusion into future Olympic events. By the late 2010s, it was estimated that the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to over 1 billion. The increasing availability of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, have become central to the growth and promotion of esports competitions. Despite viewership being approximately 85% male and 15% female, with a majority of viewers between the ages of 18 and 34, female gamers have also played professionally. The popularity and recognition of esports first took place in Asia, specifically in China and South Korea, with the latter having licensed professional players since 2000. Despite its large video game industry, esports in Japan is relatively underdeveloped, with this being largely attributed to its broad anti-gambling laws which prohibit paid professional gaming tournaments. Outside of Asia, esports are also popular in Europe and the Americas, with both regional and international events taking place in those regions. History Early history (1972–1989) Attendees of the 1981 Space Invaders Championships attempt to set the highest score The earliest known video game competition took place on 19 October 1972 at Stanford University for the game Spacewar. Stanford students were invited to an \\"Intergalactic spacewar olympics\\" whose grand prize was a year's subscription for Rolling Stone, with Bruce Baumgart winning the five-man-free-for-all tournament and Tovar and Robert E. Maas winning the team competition. The Golden age of arcade video games was heralded by Taito's Space Invaders in 1978, which popularized the use of a persistent high score for all players. Several video games in the next several years followed suit, adding other means of tracking high scores such with high score tables that included the players' initials in games like Asteroids in 1979. High score-chasing became a popular activity and a means of competition. The Space Invaders Championship held by Atari in 1980 was the earliest large scale video game competition, attracting more than 10,000 participants across the United States, establishing competitive gaming as a mainstream hobby. Walter Day owner of an arcade in Iowa, had taken it upon himself to travel across the United States to record the high scores on various games in 1980, and on his return, founded Twin Galaxies, a high score record-keeping organization. The organization went on to help promote video games and publicize its records through publications such as the Guinness Book of World Records, and in 1983 it created the U.S. National Video Game Team. The team was involved in competitions, such as running the Video Game Masters Tournament for Guinness World Records and sponsoring the North American Video Game Challenge tournament. A multicity tour in 1983, the \\"Electronic Circus\\", was used to feature these players in live challenges before audiences, and draw more people to video games. These video game players and tournaments were featured in well-circulated newspapers and popular magazines including Life and Time and became minor celebrities at the time, such as Billy Mitchell. Besides establishing the competitive nature of games, these types of promotional events all formed the nature of the marketing and promotion that formed the basis of modern esports. Televised esports events aired during this period included the American show Starcade which ran from 1982–1984 airing a total of 133 episodes, on which contestants would attempt to beat each other's high scores on an arcade game. A video game tournament was included as part of TV show That's Incredible!, and tournaments were also featured as part of the plot of various films, including 1982's Tron. In the UK, the BBC game show First Class included competitive video game rounds featuring the contemporary arcade games, such as Hyper Sports, 720° and Paperboy. The 1988 game Netrek was an Internet game for up to 16 players, written almost entirely in cross- platform open source software. Netrek was the third Internet game, the first Internet game to use metaservers to locate open game servers, and the first to have persistent user information. In 1993 it was credited by Wired Magazine as \\"the first online sports game\\". Growth and online video games (1990–1999) The fighting game Street Fighter II (1991) popularized the concept of direct, tournament-level competition between two players. Previously, video games most often relied on high scores to determine the best player, but this changed with Street Fighter II, where players would instead challenge each other directly, \\"face-to-face,\\" to determine the best player, paving the way for the competitive multiplayer and deathmatch modes found in modern action games. The popularity of fighting games such as Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom in the 1990s led to the foundation of the international Evolution Championship Series (EVO) esports tournament in 1996. Large esports tournaments in the 1990s include the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, which toured across the United States, and held its finals at Universal Studios Hollywood in California. Nintendo held a 2nd World Championships in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System called the Nintendo PowerFest '94. There were 132 finalists that played in the finals in San Diego, California. Mike Iarossi took home 1st prize. Blockbuster Video also ran their own World Game Championships in the early 1990s, co-hosted by GamePro magazine. Citizens from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Chile were eligible to compete. Games from the 1994 championships included NBA Jam and Virtua Racing. Television shows featuring esports during this period included the British shows GamesMaster and Bad Influence! the Australian game show A*mazing, where in one round contestants competed in a video game face off, and the Canadian game show Video & Arcade Top 10. In the 1990s, many games benefited from increasing internet connectivity, especially PC games. Tournaments established in the late 1990s include the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), QuakeCon, and the Professional Gamers League. PC games played at the CPL included the Counter-Strike series, Quake series, StarCraft, and Warcraft. Global tournaments (2000–present) The growth of esports in South Korea is thought to have been influenced by the mass building of broadband Internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is also thought that the high unemployment rate at the time caused many people to look for things to do while out of work. Instrumental to this growth of esports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style internet café/LAN gaming center, known as a PC bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate esports in the country. \\"Evo Moment 37\\", also known as the \\"Daigo Parry\\", refers to a portion of a Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike semi-final match held at Evolution Championship Series 2004 (Evo 2004) between Daigo Umehara and Justin Wong. During this match, Umehara made an unexpected comeback by parrying 15 consecutive hits of Wong's \\"Super Art\\" move while having only one pixel of vitality. Umehara subsequently won the match. \\"Evo Moment #37\\" is frequently described as the most iconic and memorable moment in the history of competitive video gaming. Being at one point the most-watched competitive gaming moment of all time, it has been compared to sports moments such as Babe Ruth's called shot and the Miracle on Ice. In April 2006 the G7 teams federation were formed by seven prominent Counter-Strike teams. The goal of the organization was to increase stability in the esports world, particularly in standardizing player transfers and working with leagues and organizations. The founding members were 4Kings, Fnatic, Made in Brazil, Mousesports, NiP, SK-Gaming, Team 3D. The organization only lasted until 2009 before dissolving. The 2000s was a popular time for televised esports. Television coverage was best established in South Korea, with StarCraft and Warcraft III competitions regularly televised by dedicated 24-hour cable TV game channels Ongamenet and MBCGame. Elsewhere, esports television coverage was sporadic. The German GIGA Television covered esports until its shutdown in 2009. The United Kingdom satellite television channel XLEAGUE.TV broadcast esports competitions from 2007 to 2009. The online esports only channel ESL TV briefly attempted a paid television model renamed GIGA II from June 2006 to autumn 2007. The French channel Game One broadcast esports matches in a show called Arena Online for the Xfire Trophy. The United States channel ESPN hosted Madden NFL competitions in a show called Madden Nation from 2005 to 2008. DirecTV broadcast the Championship Gaming Series tournament for two seasons in 2007 and 2008. CBS aired prerecorded footage of the 2007 World Series of Video Games tournament that was held in Louisville, Kentucky. The G4 television channel originally covered video games exclusively, but broadened its scope to cover technology and men's lifestyle, though has now shutdown. During the 2010s, esports grew tremendously, incurring a large increase in both viewership and prize money. Although large tournaments were founded before the 21st century, the number and scope of tournaments has increased significantly, going from about 10 tournaments in 2000 to about 260 in 2010. Many successful tournaments were founded during this period, including the World Cyber Games, the Intel Extreme Masters, and Major League Gaming. The proliferation of tournaments included experimentation with competitions outside traditional esports genres. For example, the September 2006 FUN Technologies Worldwide Webgames Championship featured 71 contestants competing in casual games for a $1 million grand prize. The popularity and emergence of online streaming services have helped the growth of esports in this period, and are the most common method of watching tournaments. Twitch, an online streaming platform launched in 2011, routinely streams popular esports competitions. In 2013, viewers of the platform watched 12 billion minutes of video on the service, with the two most popular Twitch broadcasters being League of Legends and Dota 2. During one day of The International, Twitch recorded 4.5 million unique views, with each viewer watching for an average of two hours. The modern esports boom has also seen a rise in video games companies embracing the esports potential of their products. After many years of ignoring and at times suppressing the esports scene, Nintendo hosted Wii Games Summer 2010. Spanning over a month, the tournament had over 400,000 participants, making it the largest and most expansive tournament in the company's history. In 2014 Nintendo hosted an invitational Super Smash Bros. for Wii U competitive tournament at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference that was streamed online on Twitch. Halo developers 343 Industries announced in 2014 plans to revive Halo as an esport with the creation of the Halo Championship Series and a prize pool of US$50,000. Both Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games have their own collegiate outreach programs with their North American Collegiate Championship. Since 2013 universities and colleges in the United States such as Robert Morris University Illinois and the University of Pikeville have recognized esports players as varsity level athletes and offer athletic scholarships. In 2017, Tespa, Blizzard Entertainment's collegiate esports division, unveiled its new initiative to provide scholarships and prizes for collegiate esports clubs competing in its tournaments worth US$1 million. Colleges have begun granting scholarships to students who qualify to play esports professionally for the school. Colleges such as Columbia College, Robert Morris University, and Indiana Institute of Technology have taken part in this. In 2018, Harrisburg University of Science and Technology began a tuition scholarship program for esports players. In 2014, the largest independent esports league, Electronic Sports League, partnered with the local brand Japan Competitive Gaming to try and grow esports in the country. Physical viewership of esports competitions and the scope of events have increased in tandem with the growth of online viewership. In 2013, the Season 3 League of Legends World Championship was held in a sold-out Staples Center. The 2014 League of Legends World Championship in Seoul, South Korea, had over 40,000 fans in attendance and featured the band Imagine Dragons, and opening and closing ceremonies in addition to the competition. In 2015, the first Esports Arena was launched in Santa Ana, California, as the United States' first dedicated esports facility.Esports arena is coming to the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas Retrieved 2 October 2017 Classification as a sport Labeling video games as sports is a controversial point of debate.Ivo v. Hilvoorde & Niek Pot (2016) Embodiment and fundamental motor skills in eSports, Sport, Ethics and Philosophy, 10:1, 14–27, Ivo van Hilvoorde (2016) Sport and play in a digital world, Sport, Ethics and Philosophy, 10:1, 1–4, While some point to the growth in popularity of esports as justification for designating some games as sports, others contend that video games will never reach the status of \\"true sports\\". However popularity is not the only reason identified: some have argued that \\"careful planning, precise timing, and skillful execution\\" ought to be what classifies an activity as sport, and that physical exertion and outdoor playing areas are not required by all traditional or non-traditional \\"sports\\". In a 2014 technology conference, when asked about the recent buyout of popular game streaming service Twitch, ESPN president John Skipper described esports as \\"not a sport – [they're] a competition.\\" In 2013 on an episode of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel the panelist openly laughed at the topic. In addition, many in the fighting games community maintain a distinction between their competitive gaming competitions and the more commercially connected esports competitions of other genres. Video games are sometimes classified as a mind sport. In the 2015 World Championship hosted by the International Esports Federation, an esports panel was hosted with guests from international sports society to discuss the future recognition of esports as a recognized, legitimate sporting activity worldwide. China was one of the first countries to recognize esport as a real sport in 2003, despite concerns at the time that video games were addicting. Through this, the government encouraged esport, stating that by participating in esports, players were also \\"training the body for China\\". Further, by early 2019, China recognized esports players as an official profession within the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security's Occupation Skill Testing Authority recommendations, as well as professional gaming operators, those that distribute and manage esports games. By July 2019, more than 100,000 people had registered themselves as professional gamers under this, with the Ministry stating that they anticipate over 2 million such people in this profession in five years. In August 2020, Beijing announced it would convert Shougang Park, an old steel production zone, into an e-sports park. In 2013, Canadian League of Legends player Danny \\"Shiphtur\\" Le became the first pro gamer to receive an American P-1A visa, a category designated for \\"Internationally Recognized Athletes\\". In 2014, Turkey's Ministry of Youth and Sports started issuing esports Player licenses to players certified as professionals. In 2016, the French government started working on a project to regulate and recognize esports. The Games and Amusements Board of the Philippines started issuing athletic license to Filipino esports players who are vouched by a professional esports team in July 2017. To help promote esports as a legitimate sport, several esports events have been run alongside more traditional international sports competitions. The 2007 Asian Indoor Games was the first notable multi-sport competition including esports as an official medal-winning event alongside other traditional sports, and the later editions of the Asian Indoor Games and its successor the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games have always included esports as an official medal event or an exhibition event up to now. Moreover, the Asian Games, which is the Asian top-level multi-sport competition, will also include esports as a medal event at the 2022 edition; esports around games such as Hearthstone, Starcraft II, and League of Legends were presented as an exhibition event at the 2018 Asian Games as a lead-in to the 2022 games. The 2019 Southeast Asian Games included six medal events for esports. In 2018 and 2019, World Sailing held an eSailing World Championship that showed a main sports federation embracing esports. Olympic Games recognition The Olympic Games are also seen as a potential method to legitimize esports. A summit held by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 2017 acknowledged the growing popularity of esports, concluding that \\"Competitive 'esports' could be considered as a sporting activity, and the players involved prepare and train with an intensity which may be comparable to athletes in traditional sports\\" but would require any games used for the Olympics fitting \\"with the rules and regulations of the Olympic movement\\". Another article by Andy Stout suggests that 106 million people viewed the 2017 Worlds Esports competition.Stout, A. (10 November 2017). How big is the eSports opportunity? Retrieved 26 March 2020, from https://www.ibc.org/create-and-produce/how-big- is-the-esports-opportunity/2533.article These are the kind of figures that are making people around the world as well as broadcasters sit up in their seats and take notice. The sporting world is changing! Esports is becoming so large that even the International Olympic committee (IOC) is beginning to host events. Two difficulties remain for presenting esports as an Olympic event according to IOC President Thomas Bach: that they would need to restrict those that present violent gameplay, and that there is currently a lack of a global sanctioning body for esports to coordinate further. On the issue of violence, while Bach acknowledged that many Olympic sports bore out from actual violent combat, \\"sport is the civilized expression about this. If you have egames where it’s about killing somebody, this cannot be brought into line with our Olympic values.\\" Due to that, it was suggested that the IOC would approve more of esports centered around games that simulate real sports, such as the NBA 2K or FIFA series. The issues around esports have not prevented the IOC from exploring what possibilities there are for incorporation into future Olympics. During July 2018, the IOC and the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) held a symposium and inviting major figures in esports, including Epic Games' Mark Rein, Blizzard Entertainment's Mike Morhaime, and esports players Dario \\"TLO\\" Wünsch, Jacob \\"Jake\\" Lyon, and Se-yeon \\"Geguri\\" Kim, for these organizations \\"to gain a deeper understanding of esports, their impact and likely future development, so that [they] can jointly consider the ways in which [they] may collaborate to the mutual benefit of all of sport in the years ahead\\". The IOC has tested the potential for esports through exhibition games. With support of the IOC, Intel sponsored exhibition esport events for StarCraft II and Steep prior to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, and five South Korean esport players were part of the Olympic Torch relay. A similar exhibition showcase, the eGames, was held alongside the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, though this was not supported by the IOC. Leaders in Japan are becoming involved to help bring esports to the 2020 Summer Olympics and beyond, given the country's reputation as a major video game industry center. Esports in Japan had not flourished due to the country's anti-gambling laws that also prevent paid professional gaming tournaments, but there were efforts starting in late 2017 to eliminate this issue. At the suggestion of the Tokyo Olympic Games Committee for the 2020 Summer Olympics, four esports organizations have worked with Japan's leading consumer organization to exempt esports tournaments from gambling law restrictions. Takeo Kawamura, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives and of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, led a collation of ruling and opposing politicians to support esports, called the Japan esports Union, or JeSU; Kawamura said that they would be willing to pass laws to further exempt esports as needed so that esports athletes can make a living playing these sports. So far, this has resulted in the ability of esports players to obtain exemption licenses to allow them to play, a similar mechanism needed for professional athletes in other sports in Japan to play professionally. The first such licenses were given out in mid-July 2018, via a tournament held by several video game publishers to award prizes to many players but with JeSU offered these exemption licenses to the top dozen or so players that emerge, allowing them to compete in further esports events. The Tokyo Olympic Committee has also planned to arrange a number of esports events to lead up into the 2020 games. The organization committee for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris were in discussions with the IOC and the various professional esport organizations to consider esports for the event, citing the need to include these elements to keep the Olympics relevant to younger generations. Ultimately, the organization committee determined esports were premature to bring to the 2024 Games as medal events, but have not ruled out other activities related to esports during the Games. During the Eighth Olympic Summit in December 2019, the IOC reiterated that it would only consider sports-simulating games for any official Olympic event, but it would look at two paths for such games in the future: those that promoted good physical and mental health lifestyles, and virtual reality and augmented reality games that included physical activity. Games A number of games are popular among professional competitors. The tournaments which emerged in the mid-1990s coincided with the popularity of fighting games and first-person shooters, genres which still maintain a devoted fan base. In the 2000s, real-time strategy games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean internet cafés, with crucial influence on the development of esports worldwide. Competitions exist for many titles and genres, though the most popular games as of the late 2010s are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Dota 2, Smite, Rocket League, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, Super Smash Bros. Melee, StarCraft II and Overwatch. Hearthstone has also popularized the digital collectible card game (DCCG) genre since its release in 2014. Video game design While it is common for video games to be designed with the experience of the player in game being the only priority, many successful esports games have been designed to be played professionally from the beginning. Developers may decide to add dedicated esports features, or even make design compromises to support high level competition. Games such as StarCraft II, League of Legends, and Dota 2 have all been designed, at least in part, to support professional competition. Spectator mode In addition to allowing players to participate in a given game, many game developers have added dedicated observing features for the benefit of spectators. This can range from simply allowing players to watch the game unfold from the competing player's point of view, to a highly modified interface that gives spectators access to information even the players may not have. The state of the game viewed through this mode may tend to be delayed by a certain amount of time in order to prevent either teams in a game from gaining a competitive advantage. Games with these features include Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty, StarCraft II, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike. League of Legends includes spectator features, which are restricted to custom game modes. In response to the release of virtual reality headsets in 2016, some games, such as Dota 2, were updated to include virtual reality spectating support. Online A very common method for connection is the Internet. Game servers are often separated by region, but high quality connections allow players to set up real-time connections across the world. Downsides to online connections include increased difficulty detecting cheating compared to physical events, and greater network latency, which can negatively impact players' performance, especially at high levels of competition. Many competitions take place online, especially for smaller tournaments and exhibition games. Since the 1990s, professional teams or organized clans have set up matches via Internet Relay Chat networks such as QuakeNet. As esports have developed, it has also become common for players to use automated matchmaking clients built into the games themselves. This was popularized by the 1996 release of Blizzard's Battle.net, which has been integrated into both the Warcraft and StarCraft series. Automated matchmaking has become commonplace in console gaming as well, with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. After competitors have contacted each other, the game is often managed by a game server, either remotely to each of the competitors, or running on one of the competitor's machines. Local area network Additionally, competitions are also often conducted over a local area network or LAN. The smaller network usually has very little lag and higher quality. Because competitors must be physically present, LANs help ensure fair play by allowing direct scrutiny of competitors. This helps prevent many forms of cheating, such as unauthorized hardware or software modding. The physical presence of competitors helps create a more social atmosphere at LAN events. Many gamers organize LAN parties or visit Internet cafés, and most major tournaments are conducted over LANs. Individual games have taken various approaches to LAN support. In contrast to the original StarCraft, StarCraft II was released without support for LAN play, drawing some strongly negative reactions from players. League of Legends was originally released for online play only, but announced in October 2012 that a LAN client was in the works for use in major tournaments. In September 2013, Valve added general support for LAN play to Dota 2 in a patch for the game. Players and teams Professional gamers, or \\"pro gamers\\", are often associated with gaming teams and/or broader gaming associations. Teams like FaZe Clan, 100 Thieves, Evil Geniuses, Team SoloMid, Cloud9, Fnatic, Mineski, Counter Logic Gaming, T1, G2 Esports, Team Envy, and Natus Vincere consist of several professionals. These teams often cover multiple esports games within tournaments and leagues, with various team makeups for each game. They may also represent single players for one-on-one esports games like fighting games within Evolution Championship Series, or Hearthstone tournaments. In addition to prize money from tournament wins, players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware. Prominent esports sponsors include companies such as Logitech and Razer. Teams feature these sponsors on their website, team jerseys and on their social media, in 2016 the biggest teams have social media followings of over a million. Associations include the Korean e-Sports Association (KeSPA), the International e-Sports Federation (IeSF), the British esports Association, and the World esports Association (WESA). Some traditional sporting athletes have invested in esports, such as Rick Fox's ownership of Echo Fox, Jeremy Lin's ownership of Team VGJ, Shaquille O'Neal's investment in NRG Esports. Some association football teams, such as FC Schalke 04 in Germany, Paris Saint- Germain esports in France; Besiktas JK, Fenerbahce S.K., and Galatasaray in Turkey; Panathinaikos F.C. in Greece either sponsor or have complete ownership in esports teams.  Training  The training that the players must undergo to prepare for tournaments is different but still takes a tremendous amount of time. Athletes from traditional sports' training is almost entirely based on honing their physical prowess in performing that sport, such as muscle memory, exercising, and dieting. Esports athletes' training is much more based on training the mind, such as studying strategies and new updates for the game. Team Liquid, a professional League of Legends team, practice for a minimum of 50 hours per week and most play the game far more. This training schedule for players has resulted in many of them retiring an early age. Few careers burn as intensely—and as briefly—as that of an esports professional. Players are generally in competition by their mid- to late-teens, with most retiring by their late-20s. In April 2020, researchers from the Queensland University of Technology found that some of the top esport players showed similar aspects of mental toughness as Olympic athletes. Leagues and tournaments  Promotion and relegation leagues  In most team-based esports, organized play is centered around the use of promotion and relegation to move sponsored teams between leagues within the competition's organization based on how the team fared in matches; this follows patterns of professional sports in European and Asian countries. Teams will play a number of games across a season as to vie for top positioning in the league by the end of that season. Those that do well, in addition to prize money, may be promoted into a higher- level league, while those that fare poorly can be regulated downward. For example, until 2018 Riot Games runs several League of Legends series, with the League of Legends Championship Series being the top-tier series. Teams that did not do well were relegated to the League of Legends Challenger Series, replaced by the better performing teams from that series. This format was discontinued when Riot opted to use the franchise format in mid-2018.  Franchised leagues  A match from the second season of the Overwatch League, occurring at Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles With rising interest in viewership of esports, some companies sought to create leagues that followed the franchise approach used in North American professional sports, in which all teams, backed by a major financial sponsor to support the franchise, participate in a regular season of matches to vie for top standing as to participate in the post-season games. This approach is more attractive for larger investors, who would be more willing to back a team that remains playing in the esport's premiere league and not threatened to be relegated to a lower standing. Though the details vary from league to league, these leagues generally require all signed player to have a minimum salary with appropriate benefits, and may share in the team's winnings. While there is no team promotion or relegation, players can be signed onto contracts, traded among teams, or let go as free agents, and new players may be pulled from the esports' equivalent minor league. The first such league to be formed was the Overwatch League, established by Blizzard Entertainment in 2016 based on its Overwatch game. Initially launched in 2018 with 12 teams, the league expanded to twenty teams in 2019. Though the first two seasons were played at Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, the Overwatch League's third season in 2020 will implement the typical home/away game format at esports arenas in the teams' various home cities or regions. Take-Two Interactive partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA) to create the NBA 2K League, using the NBA 2K game series. It is the first esports league to be operated by a professional sports league, and the NBA sought to have a League team partially sponsored by each of the 30 professional NBA teams. Its inaugural season is set to start May 2018 with 17 teams. Similarly, EA Sports and Major League Soccer (MLS) established the eMLS in 2018, a league using EA's FIFA series. Activision launched its 12-team Call of Duty League in January 2020, following the format of the Overwatch League but based on the Call of Duty series. Cloud9 and Dignitas, among others, have started development of a franchise- based Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league, Flashpoint, in February 2020. This will be the first such esports league to be owned by the teams rather than any single organization. Tournaments Casual players at the 2013 Intel Extreme Masters in Katowice, Poland Esports are also frequently played in tournaments, where potential players and teams vie to be placed through qualification matches before entering the tournament. From there, the tournament formats can vary from single or double elimination, sometimes hybridized with group stage. Esports tournaments are almost always physical events in which occur in front of a live audience, with referees or officials to monitor for cheating. The tournament may be part of a larger gathering, such as Dreamhack, or the competition may be the entirety of the event, like the World Cyber Games or the Fortnite World Cup. Esport competitions have also become a popular feature at gaming and multi-genre conventions. Although competitions involving video games have long existed, esports underwent a significant transition in the late 1990s. Beginning with the Cyberathlete Professional League in 1997, tournaments became much larger, and corporate sponsorship became more common. Increasing viewership both in person and online brought esports to a wider audience. Major tournaments include the World Cyber Games, the North American Major League Gaming league, the France- based Electronic Sports World Cup, and the World e-Sports Games held in Hangzhou, China. The average compensation for professional esports players does not compare to those of the top classical sports organizations in the world. According to Julian Krinsky Camps & Programs website, the top Esports player in the world earned around $2.5 million in 2017. The highest overall salary by any esports professional at the time was around $3.6 million. While prizes for esports competitions can be very large, the limited number of competitions and large number of competitors ultimately lowers the amount of money one can make in the industry. In the United States, Esports competitions have prizes that can reach $200,000 for a single victory. Dota 2 International hosted a competition where the grand-prize winning team walked home with almost $10.9 million. For well established games, total prize money can amount to millions of U.S. dollars a year. As of 10 September 2016, Dota 2 has awarded approximately US$86 million in prize money within 632 registered tournaments, with 23 players winning over $1 million. League of Legends awarded approximately $30 million within 1749 registered tournaments, but in addition to the prize money, Riot Games provides salaries for players within their League of Legends Championship Series. Nonetheless, there has been criticism to how these salaries are distributed, since most players earn a fairly low wage but a few top players have a significantly higher salary, skewing the average earning per player. In August 2018, The International 2018, Valve's annual premier Dota 2 tournament, was held and broke the record for holding the largest prize pool to date for any esports tournament, amounting to over US$25 million. Often, game developers provide prize money for tournament competition directly, but sponsorship may also come from third parties, typically companies selling computer hardware, energy drinks, or computer software. Generally, hosting a large esports event is not profitable as a stand-alone venture. For example, Riot has stated that their headline League of Legends Championship Series is \\"a significant investment that we're not making money from\\". There is considerable variation and negotiation over the relationship between video game developers and tournament organizers and broadcasters. While the original StarCraft events emerged in South Korea largely independently of Blizzard, the company decided to require organizers and broadcasters to authorize events featuring the sequel StarCraft II. In the short term, this led to a deadlock with the Korean e-Sports Association. An agreement was reached in 2012. Blizzard requires authorization for tournaments with more than US$10,000 in prizes. Riot Games offers in-game rewards to authorized tournaments. Collegiate and school leagues In addition to professional and amateur esports, esports have drawn attention of colleges and high schools since 2008. Along with the bursting popularity of Esports over the last two decades came a demand for extended opportunities for Esport's athletes. Universities across the world (mostly China and America) began offering scholarship opportunities to incoming freshmen to join their collegiate Esports teams. According to Schaeperkoetter (2017) and others, the potential impact that an eSports program could have on a university, coupled with the growing interest that universities are showing in such a program, combine to make this line of research relevant in sport literature.Schaeperkoetter, C. C., Mays, J., Hyland, S. T., Wilkerson, Z., Oja, B., Krueger, K., Christian, R., & Bass, J. R. (2017). The \\"New\\" Student- Athlete: An Exploratory Examination of Scholarship eSports Players. Journal of Intercollegiate Sport, 10(1), 1-21. https://doi.org/10.1123/jis.2016-0011 As of 2019, over 130 colleges has esports-based variety programs. Governing bodies While game publishers or esport broadcasters typically act in oversight roles for specific esports, a number of esport governing bodies have been established to collectively represent esports on a national, regional or global basis. These governing bodies may have various levels of involvement with the esport, from being part of esports regulation to simply acting more as a trade group and public face for esports. The International Esports Federation (IESF) was one of the first such bodies. Originally formed in 2008 to help promote esports in the southeast Asian region, it has grown to include 56 member countries from across the global. The IESF has managed annual Esport World Championships for teams from its member countries across multiple games. The European Esports Federation was formed in April 2019 and includes UK, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Russia, Slovenia, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine. This body was designed more to be a managing partner for other esports, working to coordinate event structures and regulations across multiple esports. Additionally, trade groups representing video games have also generally acted as governing bodies for esports. Notably, in November 2019, five major national trade organizations - the Entertainment Software Association in the United States, the Entertainment Software Association of Canada, The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment, Interactive Software Federation of Europe, and the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association of Australian and New Zealand - issued a joined statement for supporting the promotion and participation of esports to respect player safety and integrity, respect and diversity among players, and enriching game play. Ethics and legal problems Pro gamers are usually obligated to behave ethically, abiding by both the explicit rules set out by tournaments, associations, and teams, as well as following general expectations of good sportsmanship. For example, it is common practice and considered good etiquette to chat \\"gg\\" (for \\"good game\\") when defeated. Many games rely on the fact competitors have limited information about the game state. In a prominent example of good conduct, during a 2012 IEM StarCraft II game, the players Feast and DeMusliM both voluntarily offered information about their strategies to negate the influence of outside information inadvertently leaked to \\"Feast\\" during the game. Players in some leagues have been reprimanded for failure to comply with expectations of good behavior. In 2012 professional League of Legends player Christian \\"IWillDominate\\" Riviera was banned from competing for a period of one year following a history of verbal abuse. In 2013 StarCraft II progamer Greg \\"Idra\\" Fields was fired from Evil Geniuses for insulting his fans on the Team Liquid internet forums. League of Legends players Mithy and Nukeduck received similar penalties in 2014 after behaving in a \\"toxic\\" manner during matches. Team Siren, an all-female League of Legends team, was formed in June 2013. The announcement of the team was met with controversy, being dismissed as a \\"gimmick\\" to attract the attention of men. The team disbanded within a month, due to the negative publicity of their promotional video, as well as the poor attitude of the team captain towards her teammates. There have been serious violations of the rules. In 2010, eleven StarCraft: Brood War players were found guilty of fixing matches for profit, and were fined and banned from future competition. Team Curse and Team Dignitas were denied prize money for collusion during the 2012 MLG Summer Championship. In 2012, League of Legends team Azubu Frost was fined US$30,000 for cheating during a semifinal match of the world playoffs. Dota 2 player Aleksey \\"Solo\\" Berezin was suspended from a number of tournaments for intentionally throwing a game in order to collect $322 from online gambling. In 2014, four high-profile North American Counter- Strike players from iBuyPower, namely Sam \\"DaZeD\\" Marine, Braxton \\"swag\\" Pierce, Joshua \\"steel\\" Nissan and Keven \\"AZK\\" Lariviere were suspended from official tournaments after they had been found guilty of match-fixing. The four players had allegedly profited over US$10,000 through betting on their fixed matches. Gambling on esports using Counter-Strike: Global Offense \\"skins\\", worth an estimated US$2.3 billion in 2015, had come under criticism in June and July 2016 after several questionable legal and ethical aspects of the practice were discovered. Performance-enhancing drugs Reports of widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in esports are not uncommon, with players discussing their own, their teammates' and their competitors' use and officials acknowledging the prevalence of the issue. Players often turn to stimulants such as Ritalin, Adderall and Vyvanse, drugs which can significantly boost concentration, improve reaction time and prevent fatigue. Selegiline, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, is reportedly popular because, like stimulants, it enhances mood and motivation. Conversely, drugs with calming effects are also sought after. Some players take propranolol, which blocks the effects of adrenaline, or Valium, which is prescribed to treat anxiety disorder, in order to remain calm under pressure. According to Bjoern Franzen, a former SK Gaming executive, it is second nature for some League of Legends players to take as many as three different drugs before competition. In July 2015 Kory \\"Semphis\\" Friesen, an ex-Cloud9 player, admitted that he and his teammates were all using Adderall during a match against Virtus.pro in the ESL One Katowice 2015 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournament, and went on to claim that \\"everyone\\" at ESEA League tournaments uses Adderall. in 2020 former Call of Duty champion Adam “KiLLa” Sloss told the Washington Post that one of the reasons he stopped competing in Esports was due to rampant drug use. The unregulated use of such drugs poses severe risks to competitors' health, including addiction, overdose, serotonin syndrome and, in the case of stimulants, weight loss. Even over-the-counter energy drinks which are marketed specifically toward gamers have faced media and regulatory scrutiny due to deaths and hospitalizations. Accordingly, Adderall and other such stimulants are banned and their use penalized by many professional sporting bodies and leagues, including Major League Baseball and the National Football League. Although International e-Sports Federation (IeSF) is a signatory of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the governing body has not outlawed any PEDs in its sanctioned competitions. Action has been taken on the individual league level, however, as at least one major league, the Electronic Sports League, has made use of any drugs during matches punishable by expulsion from competition. Although not all players use drugs, it is common to see gamers use energy boosters or drinks. They commonly drink caffeinated drinks or use energy pills. Player exploitation There has been some concern over the quality of life and potential mistreatment of players by organizations, especially in South Korea. Korean organizations have been accused of refusing to pay competitive salaries, leading to a slow exodus of Korean players to other markets. In an interview, League of Legends player Bae \\"Dade\\" Eo-jin said that \\"Korean players wake up at 1 pm and play until 5 am\\", and suggested that the 16-hour play schedule was a significant factor in causing burnout. Concerns over the mental health of players intensified in 2014 when League of Legends player Cheon \\"Promise\\" Min-Ki attempted suicide a week after admitting to match fixing. To combat the negative environment, Korean League of Legends teams were given new rules for the upcoming 2015 season by Riot Games, including the adoption of minimum salaries for professional players, requiring contracts and allowing players to stream individually for additional player revenue. Players must handle their own treatments and carry their own medical insurance, which is the opposite of the norm with professional sports teams. Since most esports play requires many actions per minute, some players may get repetitive strain injuries, causing hand or wrist pain.Luke Winkie (31 May 2016) The eSports Injury Crisis Vocativ, Retrieved 3 June 2016. Economics League of Legends Championship Series and League of Legends Champions Korea offer guaranteed salaries for players. Despite this, online streaming is preferred by some players, as it is in some cases more profitable than competing with a team and streamers have the ability to determine their own schedule. The International tournament awards US$10 million to the winners, however teams that do not have the same amount of success often do not have financial stability and frequently break up after failing to win. In 2015 it was estimated by SuperData Research that the global esports industry generated revenue of around US$748.8 million that year. Asia is the leading esports market with over $321 million in revenue, North America is around $224 million, and Europe has $172 million and the rest of the world for about $29 million. Global esports revenue is estimated to reach $1.9 billion by 2018. The number of female viewers has been growing in esports, with an estimated 30% of esports viewers being female in 2013, an increase from 15% from the previous year. However, despite the increase in female viewers, there is not a growth of female players in high level competitive esports. The top female players that are involved in esports mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, most notably Counter-Strike, Dead or Alive 4, and StarCraft II. All-female esports teams include Frag Dolls and PMS Clan. Gambling Gambling and betting on esport matches have generally been illegal in major markets. The illegality of esport gambling has created a black market and virtual currency. And since it is not regulated, this may encourage match-fixing by players themselves, and lead to issues with underage gambling due to the draw of video games. A bright example can be represented by skin gambling, where virtual items earned in games are used as a currency, and it let users bet on the outcome of matches. Esports gambling in the United States has been illegal under the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) until May 2018. The Act prevented all but five states from allowing gambling on sporting events. However, regulation of esports betting still depended on state law. Some betting houses in Nevada, where sports betting has been already exempted under PASPA, classify esports as non-competitive \\"other events\\" similar to the selection of the Heisman Trophy winner or NFL Draft which are considered as legal. Other companies established in the United States allow betting on esports to international users but are restricted to Americans. Nevada legalized esports gambling in June 2017, classifying esports alongside with competitive sports and dog racing. With the Supreme Court of the United States's ruling in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association in May 2018, PASPA was recognized as unconstitutional, as the Court claimed that the federal government cannot limit states from regulating sports betting. This created the potential for legalized esports-based betting in the United States. However, New Jersey, the state at the center of the Supreme Court case, passed its bill to legalize sports gambling but restricted gambling on esports to only international competitions where most players are over 18 years of age. Without PASPA, interstate gambling on esports would be still be limited by the Federal Wire Act, preventing users from betting on national esports events outside of the state. In 2019, the countries where esports gambling is legal include the UK, New Zealand, Australia, China, Spain, Canada, South Korea, and Japan, and many of them are the international hosts for gaming tournaments. Also by the end of 2019, the state of New Jersey approved esports betting, just in time for the finals of the LoL Worlds Cup 2019 final match, which had over 4.000.000 spectators.  The incentives of the industry  Just as it happens with traditional sports, bookmarkers and gambling companies do their best to attract as many gamblers as possible. Yet, one of the biggest issues with the esports gambling industry has been its target audience. Thus, as an important part of the esports audience is underage most governments have been a bit skeptical regarding this market's moral view. Nevertheless, a huge synergy has been shown between the esports and gambling industries as online betting houses have been able to aim to younger audiences and experiment with new forms of gambling adapted to each game title and/or tournament. Furthermore, these industries have got so close that there are even betting houses sponsoring professional esports teams, as happened with the contract between Betway and PSG.LGD team (Dota 2) in August 2019.  Types of esports Gambling  As far as esports gambling goes, most of the bets move within the same nature as they do with traditional sports. Therefore, most gambling sites offering the booker service allow users to bet based on the outcome of tournaments, matches or special esports titles. On the other hand, due to the nature of esports, there are plenty of innovative ways to bet, which are based on in-game milestones. For example, League of Legend bettors may place their money on which team/champion will take the \\"First Blood\\". On the other hand, First-person shooters like Counter- Strike: Global Offensive is also open to \\"First Map\\" bets. Besides, some bookers allow \\"odds & even\\" bets which allow players to take chances on whether the final count of a game, mostly in kills, will be an odd or even number. Furthermore, there are different types of betting in esports based on the means of the bet. While an important part of this market is guided by bookers, some games allow bets in their in-game currency. On the other hand, players may stablish to do in-game or offline transactions to cover personal bets on the matches they participate in. Data analytics and machine learning With the growing popularity of machine learning in data analytics, esports has been the focus of several software programs that analyze the plethora of game data available. Based on the huge number of matches played on a daily basis globally (League of Legends alone had a reported 100 million active monthly players worldwide in 2016 and an average of 27 million League of Legends games played per day reported in 2014Sheer, Ian (27 January 2014). \\"Player Tally for 'League of Legends' Surges\\". Wsj.com. Archived from the original on 30 January 2014. Retrieved 31 January 2014.), these games can be used for applying big-data machine learning platforms. Several games make their data publicly available, so websites aggregate the data into easy-to- visualize graphs and statistics. In addition, several programs use machine learning tools to predict the win probability of a match based on various factors, such as team composition. In 2018, the DotA team Team Liquid partnered with a software company to allow players and coaches to predict the team's success rate in each match and provide advice on what needs to be changed to improve performance. Game cancellations As more esport competitions and leagues are run entirely or in portion by the video game publisher or developer for the game, the ongoing viability of that game's esport activities is tied to that company. In December 2018, Blizzard announced that it was reducing resources spent on the development of Heroes of the Storm and canceling its plans for tournaments in 2019. This caused several professional Heroes players and coaches recognizing their career was no longer viable, and expressed outrage and disappointment at Blizzard's decision. Media coverage News reporting The main medium for esports coverage is the Internet. In the mid-2010s, mainstream sports and news reporting websites, such as ESPN, Yahoo!, Sport1, Kicker, and Aftonbladet started dedicated esports coverage. esports tournaments commonly use commentators or casters to provide live commentary of games in progress, similar to a traditional sports commentator. For popular casters, providing commentary for esports can be a full-time position by itself. Prominent casters for StarCraft II include Dan \\"Artosis\\" Stemkoski and Nick \\"Tasteless\\" Plott. In 2018, the Associated Press' AP Stylebook officially began spelling the word as \\"esports\\", dropping support for both the capital \\"S\\" and the dash between \\"e\\" and \\"sports\\" styles, similar to how \\"e-mail\\" transformed with common usage to \\"email\\". Richard Tyler Blevins, better known as \\"Ninja\\", became the first professional gamer to appear in a cover story for a major sports magazine when he appeared in the September 2018 issue of ESPN The Magazine. Internet live streaming Many esports events are streamed online to viewers over the internet. With the shutdown of the Own3d streaming service in 2013, Twitch is by far the most popular streaming service for esports, competing against other providers such as Hitbox.tv, Azubu, and YouTube Gaming. Dreamhack Winter 2011 reached 1.7 million unique viewers on Twitch. While coverage of live events usually brings in the largest viewership counts, the recent popularization of streaming services has allowed individuals to broadcast their own gameplay independent of such events as well. Individual broadcasters can enter an agreement with Twitch or Hitbox in which they receive a portion of the advertisement revenue from commercials which run on the stream they create. Another major streaming platform was Major League Gaming's MLG.tv. The network, which specializes in Call of Duty content but hosts a range of gaming titles, has seen increasing popularity, with 1376% growth in MLG.tv viewership in Q1 of 2014. The 2014 Call of Duty: Ghosts broadcast at MLG's X Games event drew over 160,000 unique viewers. The network, like Twitch, allows users to broadcast themselves playing games, though only select individuals can use the service. For several years, MLG.tv was the primary streaming platform for the Call of Duty professional scene; famous players such as NaDeSHoT and Scump have signed contracts with the company to use its streaming service exclusively. In January 2016, MLG was acquired by Activision Blizzard. YouTube also relaunched its livestreaming platform with a renewed focus on live gaming and esports specifically. For The International 2014, coverage was also simulcast on ESPN's streaming service ESPN3. In December 2016, Riot Games announced a deal with MLB Advanced Media's technology division BAM Tech for the company to distribute and monetize broadcasts of League of Legends events through 2023. BAM Tech will pay Riot at least $300 million per-year, and split advertising revenue. Television StarCraft match televised on MBCGame in Seoul, South Korea Especially since the popularization of streaming in esports, organizations no longer prioritize television coverage, preferring online streaming websites such as Twitch. Ongamenet continues to broadcast as an esports channel in South Korea, but MBCGame was taken off the air in 2012. Riot Games' Dustin Beck stated that \\"TV's not a priority or a goal\\", and DreamHack's Tomas Hermansson said \\"esports have [been proven] to be successful on internet streaming [services].\\" On the night before the finals of The International 2014 in August, ESPN3 broadcast a half-hour special profiling the tournament. In 2015, ESPN2 broadcast Heroes of the Dorm, the grand finals of the Heroes of the Storm collegiate tournament. The first-place team from the University of California, Berkeley received tuition for each of the team's players, paid for by Blizzard and Tespa. The top four teams won gaming equipment and new computers. This was the first time an eSport had ever been broadcast on a major American television network. The broadcast was an attempt to broaden the appeal of esports by reaching viewers who would not normally come across it. However, the broadcast was met with a few complaints. Those living outside of the United States were unable to view the tournament. Additionally, the tournament could not be viewed online via streams, cutting off a large portion of viewers from the main demographic in the process. In September 2015, Turner Broadcasting partnered with WME/IMG. In December 2015, the partnered companies announced two seasons of the ELeague, a Counter- Strike: Global Offensive league based in North America including 15 teams from across the world competing for a $1,200,000 prize pool each 10-week season. The tournament, filmed at Turner's studios in Atlanta, Georgia, is simultaneously streamed on online streaming websites and TBS on Friday nights. In January 2016, Activision Blizzard, publishers of the Call of Duty and StarCraft series, acquired Major League Gaming. In an interview with The New York Times about the purchase, Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick explained that the company was aspiring to create a U.S. cable network devoted to esports, which he described as \\"the ESPN of video games\\". He felt that higher quality productions, more in line with those of traditional sports telecasts, could help to broaden the appeal of esports to advertisers. Activision Blizzard had hired former ESPN and NFL Network executive Steve Bornstein to be CEO of the company's esports division. TV 2, the largest private television broadcaster in Norway, broadcasts esports across the country. TV 2 partnered with local Norwegian organization House of Nerds to bring a full season of esports competition with an initial lineup of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, and StarCraft II.Commercial broadcast company TV 2 is partnering with local Norwegian organization House of Nerds to bring a full season of esports competition to domestic airwaves. In April 2016, Big Ten Network announced a collaboration with Riot to hold an invitational League of Legends competition between two universities from the collegiate Big Ten Conference, as part of Riot's collegiate championships at PAX East. On 17 January 2017, Big Ten Network and Riot announced that it would hold a larger season of conference competition involving 10 Big Ten schools. Nielsen Holdings, a global information company known for tracking viewership for television and other media, announced in August 2017 that it would launch Nielsen esports, a division devoted to providing similar viewership and other consumer research data around esports, forming an advisory board with members from ESL, Activision Blizzard, Twitch, YouTube, ESPN, and FIFA to help determine how to track and monitor audience sizes for eSport events. In July 2018, on the first day of the inaugural 2018 Overwatch League season playoffs, Blizzard and Disney announced a multi-year deal that gave Disney and its networks ESPN and ABC broadcast rights to the Overwatch League and Overwatch World Cup, starting with the playoffs and continuing with future events.

Golden Liberty. The Royal Election of 1573, by Jan Matejko Golden Liberty (; , ), sometimes referred to as Golden Freedoms, Nobles' Democracy or Nobles' Commonwealth ( or Złota wolność szlachecka) was a political system in the Kingdom of Poland and, after the Union of Lublin (1569), in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Under that system, all nobles (szlachta), regardless of rank or economic status, were considered to have equal legal status and enjoyed extensive legal rights and privileges. The nobility controlled the legislature (the Sejm—the Polish parliament) and the Commonwealth's elected king. Development This political system, unique in Europe, stemmed from the consolidation of power by the szlachta (noble class) over other social classes and over the monarchical political system. In time, the szlachta accumulated enough privileges (established by the Nihil novi Act (1505), King Henry's Articles (1573), and various Pacta conventa) that no monarch could hope to break the szlachtas grip on power. The political doctrine of the Commonwealth of the Two Nations was \\"our state is a republic under the presidency of the King\\". Chancellor Jan Zamoyski summed up this doctrine when he said that \\"Rex regnat et non gubernat\\" (\\"The King reigns but [literally 'and'] does not govern\\").Bruno Aguilera-Barchet, A History of Western Public Law: Between Nation and State, 2014, The Commonwealth had a parliament, the Sejm, as well as a Senat and an elected king. The king was obliged to respect citizens' rights specified in King Henry's Articles as well as in pacta conventa negotiated at the time of his election. The monarch's power was limited, in favour of the sizable noble class. Each new king had to subscribe to King Henry's Articles, which were the basis of Poland's political system and included almost unprecedented guarantees of religious tolerance. Over time, King Henry's Articles were merged with the pacta conventa, specific pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From then on, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and was always supervised by a group of senators. The doctrine had ancient republican thought at its roots, which was then reapplied with varying success to an elective monarchy's political reality. The foundation of the Commonwealth's political system, the \\"Golden Liberty\\" (, a term used from 1573), included: * the election of the king by all nobles wishing to participate, known as wolna elekcja (free election); * Sejm, the Commonwealth parliament, which the king was required to hold every two years; * pacta conventa (Latin), \\"agreed-to agreements\\" negotiated with the king-elect, including a bill of rights, binding on the king, derived from the earlier King Henry's Articles; * rokosz (insurrection), the right of szlachta to form a legal rebellion against a king who violated their guaranteed freedoms; * religious freedom guaranteed by Warsaw Confederation Act 1573,# Norman Davies, God's Playground. A History of Poland, Vol. 1: The Origins to 1795, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present. Oxford: Oxford University Press. / * liberum veto (Latin), the right of an individual land envoy to oppose a decision by the majority in a Sejm session; the voicing of such a \\"free veto\\" nullified all the legislation that had been passed at that session; during the crisis of the second half of the 17th century, Polish nobles could also use the liberum veto in provincial sejmiks; * konfederacja (from the Latin confederatio), the right to form an organization to force through a common political aim. The Commonwealth's political system is difficult to fit into a simple category, but it can be tentatively described as a mixture of: * confederation and federation, with regard to the broad autonomy of its regions. It is, however, difficult to decisively call the Commonwealth either confederation or federation, as it had some qualities of both of them; * oligarchy, as only the male szlachta, around 15% of the population, had political rights; * democracy, as all of the szlachta were equal in rights and privileges, and the Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones). Also, the 10% of Commonwealth population who enjoyed those political rights (the szlachta) were a substantially larger percentage than in any other European country, and the nobles extended from powerful princes to poor knights poorer than many peasants; in comparison, in France, only about 1% of the population had the right to vote in 1831, and in 1832, in the United Kingdom, only about 14% of male adults could vote; * elective monarchy, as the monarch, elected by the szlachta, was the head of state; * constitutional monarchy, as the monarch was bound by pacta conventa and other laws, and the szlachta could disobey any of the king's decrees that they deemed to be illegal. Assessment The \\"Golden Liberty\\" was a unique and controversial feature of Poland's political system. It was an exception, characterized by a strong aristocracy and a feeble king, in an age when absolutism was developing in the stronger countries of Europe, but the exception, was characterized by a striking similarity to certain modern values.Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, 2005, , p.262 At a time that most European countries were headed toward centralization, absolute monarchy and religious and dynastic warfare, the Commonwealth experimented with decentralization, confederation and federation, democracy, religious tolerance and even pacifism. Since the Sejm usually vetoed a monarch's plans for war, it was a notable argument for the democratic peace theory. 2000\\\\. Especially pp9–11, 114, 181, 323.

The town had a population of 1,408 at the 2011 Census. The parish includes the hamlets of Battleton and Ashwick which is located approximately north west of Dulverton. To the west of the hamlet lies Ashwick House, built in the Edwardian style in 1901.Jacobs, Brian, Ashwick House near Dulverton, Exmoor Encyclopedia Also nearby is the estate of Northmoor, formerly a seat of Sir Frederick Wills, 1st Baronet of Northmoor, one of the four Wills Baronetcys, and the founders of the Imperial Tobacco Company. In 1929 Sir Frederick's son & heir, Sir Gilbert Wills, 2nd Baronet , was raised to the peerage as Baron Dulverton, whose principal seat was at Batsford Park, near Batsford, Gloucestershire. Dulverton is a popular tourist destination for exploring Exmoor, and is home to the Exmoor National Park Authority headquarters. The town lies on the route of the Exe Valley Way and Land's End Trail. History The name Dulverton was first recorded in 1084 as dieglaford-tun meaning \\"hidden ford\\"-tun. The Domesday Book records it as Dolvertune and suggests it was a royal manor before the Norman Conquest. The town lies below the Iron Age hillforts of Oldberry Castle, Mounsey Castle and Brewer's Castle. The manor was granted to the Turbervilles by William I and in the late 12th century they gave the church and some land to Taunton Priory. The remainder of the manor passed to the Shete family. The parish of Dulverton was part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred. The Middle Ages saw continued growth and the establishment of fairs and markets, with several small industries based upon the traditions of upland farming and the wool trade. These include related works such as laundries; originally used for the washing of sheep fleeces in the leats feeding the wide and fast-flowing River Barle, the surviving 19th-century industrial laundries continue to provide a service to surrounding businesses. The market house in Fore Street, which is believed to date from 1760, was converted into the town hall in 1866, with the porch and external double staircase being added in 1930 by Sir Albert Richardson. The manor of Dulverton was purchased in 1568 by the Sydenham family seated at Combe House, on the opposite side of the River Barle to Dulverton, a junior branch of the ancient de Sydenham family which originated at the manor of Sydenham, near Bridgwater in Somerset, of which other branches were seated in Somerset at Combe Sydenham, Orchard Sydenham (later called Orchard Wyndham) and Brympton d'Evercy, which latter remained the seat of the Sydenham baronets, which title was created in 1641.Burke, John & Burke, John Bernard, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies of England, Ireland and Scotland, 2nd edition, London, 1841, pp.514-5 In 1858 the Sydenhams sold the manor to the Earl of Carnarvon of Pixton Park, Dulverton. George Sydenham Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe (1848-1933) took his title from Combe, Dulverton. Exmoor House was built as the Dulverton Union Workhouse in 1855. It is now the headquarters of the Exmoor National Park Authority. Private housing stock generally ranges from medium-size to substantial Georgian to late Victorian family houses, with a small estate of post-war modern houses and bungalows towards the north of town. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The town falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Dulverton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. As Dulverton falls within the Exmoor National Park some functions normally administered by district or county councils have, since 1997, fallen under the Exmoor National Park Authority, which is known as a ‘single purpose’ authority, which aims to \\"conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks\\" and \\"promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public\\", including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment. Dulverton is the most populous area of the electoral ward called 'Dulverton and District'. The ward stretches north from Dulverton to Winsford. The total population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 2,491. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography Barle Bridge The town lies in the deep, wooded valley of the River Barle, at an ancient route convergence and river crossing. The river and the Barle Valley are both designated as biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The river passes under the Tarr Steps, a prehistoric clapper bridge possibly dating from 1000 BC. The stone slabs weigh up to 5 tons each. According to local legend, they were placed by the devil to win a bet. The bridge is long and has 17 spans. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. The other bridges over the Barle include the five span Barle Bridge which is medieval in origin. It has double rings on the downstream side and single rings on the upstream side. It was repaired in 1624, and subsequently widened in 1819 by John Stone. It was further repaired in 1866 and in 1952–1953 after flood damage. The 18th-century Marsh Bridge was altered in 1866 when the central pier was removed and an iron bridge inserted. The parapet was destroyed in 1952 and reconstructed in steel in 1979. Towards Brushford the River Barle is crossed by the New Bridge dating from 1870, which led to Pixton Park, which was the home of John Dyke Acland and his wife Harriet Acland and later the family of Evelyn Waugh and Auberon Waugh. The other major river in the parish is the River Exe, which is on the parish boundary with Brompton Regis, which is crossed by the medieval Chilly Bridge and Hele Bridge, and the 18th century Weir Bridge. In between the town centre and the river is a large recreation meadow which recently underwent renovation by locals (including the pupils of Dulverton Middle School) supported by a Barclays Bank New Futures Scheme. South of the town is Briggins Moor a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest which provides an example of unimproved mire of a type which is restricted to south-west England and Wales and which has been significantly reduced in extent in the recent past. Purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum) are abundant. There is a large colony of the marsh fritillary butterfly (Eurodryas aurinia).English Nature citation sheet for the site . Retrieved 9 August 2006. Transport Dulverton station just after the rails were lifted in October 1969 Two miles from Dulverton is the village of Brushford, where the Dulverton railway station on the Taunton to Barnstaple line used to be. It opened in 1873 and closed to passengers, who transferred to Dulverton by bus, in 1963. The station buildings are still visible and it is clear where the lines used to run as the railway embankment is still visible and worn in places although the rails have been lifted. Religious sites The parish Church of All Saints in Bank Square has a tower from the 15th century, which was extensively restored between 1853 and 1855 when the rest of church was rebuilt by Edward Ashworth. It has been designated as Grade II* listed building. The Congregational Church in Chapel Street was built in the 19th century with adjoining schoolrooms. Cultural references Two ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS Dulverton after the Dulverton Hunt. The first, , launched in 1941, was a type II Hunt-class destroyer. She served in the Second World War and was scuttled in 1943 after being severely damaged by German air attack. The second and current , launched in 1982, is a Hunt-class minesweeper.

A stille omgang (\\"Silent Walk\\" or circumambulation) is an informal ritual that served as substitute for the Roman Catholic processions that were prohibited after the Reformation in the Netherlands in the 16th century. Best known is the Stille Omgang of Amsterdam, which is still performed every year in March. This walk commemorates the Miracle of the Host of 16 March 1345, a Eucharistic miracle which involved a dying man vomiting upon being given the Holy Sacrament and last rites. The Host was then, due to liturgical regulations, put in the fire, but miraculously remained intact and could be retrieved from the ashes the following day. This miracle was quickly recognized by the municipality of Amsterdam and the bishop of Utrecht, and a large pilgrimage chapel, the Heilige Stede (\\"Holy Site\\") was built where the house had stood, and the Heiligeweg (\\"Holy Way\\") as the major pilgrimage route to it. The Stille Omgang fell out of an individual practice since the 17th century, but was revived in a collective form in 1881, imitating in that way the medieval procession for the Miracle. During the 1950s up to 90.000 Catholics, from all over the Netherlands, walked the Silent Walk, nowadays usually about 5,000 people (2016) take part in it, following Mass in one of Amsterdam's churches.

His father, the count Carlo Augusto Brunetta of Usseaux was a high-degree official of the Royal Sardinian Army, headquartered in the same city. The mother was Carolyne Mattone of Benevello also come from an Italian noble family who owned the Castle of Mazzè (near Turin), related to the family Valperga since seven centuries before. Born in Vercelli into a family of French origin, Brunetta d'Usseaux was educated in Turin. After the beginning of the Second Italian War of Independence, he had gone on living here with his mother, because their home based in Vercelli was too near the military front, as the border of Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia. At the end of the studies in the exclusive Nobles College located in the modern Academy of Science of Turin, Brunetta married the countess Catherine Zeyffart, a landowner of enormous plots in Ukraine, which was descendant from an ancient and noble Russian family, maybe linked to the Romanov dynasty of Zar. When she died in 1897, count Eugenio Brunetta went to live in Paris, where by many years he was living nine months a year in his property home, just coming in Italy during the summer. Himself an active rower and rider, the count was very interested in sports, and was in Paris that he met with Baron Pierre de Coubertin interested to him, for the reinstatement of the Olympic Games. His engagement for the sports (ideals) was so very close to him, that in 1897 Brunetta d'Usseaux become member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which he remained until his death, as general secretary since 1908. Till the 21st century, he was the only Italian person recovering this charge. He succeeded in bringing the 1908 Summer Olympics to Rome, but Italy had to forfeit the organization of the Olympics in 1906, due to financial and organisational problems. The 1908 Games were held in London instead. That same year, Brunetta d'Usseaux was appointed secretary of the IOC. In this position, he tried to get winter sports on the Olympic programme, and suggested to have a separate winter sports week attached to the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. This was opposed by the Swedish organizers, but Brunetta d'Usseaux managed to get a winter sports week scheduled for 1916. Due to World War I, these Olympics were never organized. The count died, under unclear circumstances, in France in 1919, and would not live to see the first Winter Olympic Games in 1924, maybe in Nice. At that time, he would to come in Russia for acknowledging the family of his wife, after the start of Russian Revolution. He would to be buried in Pinerolo, but never come there.

It is the home of Appledore Shipbuilders, a lifeboat slipway and Hocking's Ice Cream, a brand of ice cream only sold in North Devon. The local football club is Appledore F.C. The ward population at the 2011 census increased to 2,814  History  Appledore is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 (though it mentions two other, smaller, Appledores in Devon). Its earliest recorded name, in 1335, is le Apildore in the manor of Northam. There was a Saxon settlement, but the Devon historian WG Hoskins says of the local legend that it was the site of a Viking raid in 878 AD, 'there is no authority for this identification'. The settlement prospered as a port in the Elizabethan period, and some cottages date from this period. The construction of a quay in 1845 further developed the port, and as a result Appledore has a rich maritime heritage from the second half of the 19th century. The painter Edward Calvert was born there in 1799.not the other Appledore, Devon: Appledore, Mid Devon, near Tiverton. Shipowner Sir William Reardon Smith was born in Appledore and went to the Wesleyan school there. The Richmond Dry Dock was built in 1856 by William Yeo and named after Richmond Bay in Prince Edward Island, where the Yeo family's shipping fleet was based. From 1882 until the 1930s it was owned by Robert Cook, and continued in use until the 1960s. It is a Grade II* listed building. There is a maritime museum in the village chronicling the history of shipbuilding and seafaring in the village. Appledore Lifeboat Station in 2017 A lifeboat service for the area around the mouth of the River Taw was introduced in February 1825. The boat was kept in the King's Watch House at Appledore for six years until a new boat house was built at Watertown, half a mile nearer the sea. From 1848 a second lifeboat was stationed at Braunton Burrows on the opposite side of the estuary but its crew always came from Appledore. A third station was built at Northam Burrows to the west of Appledore in 1851 and the Appledore boat moved there. A new station at Badsteps allowed Northam Burrows to close in 1889 and Braunton Burrows closed in 1918 as it was difficult to find men and horses to launch the boat. Appledore Lifeboat Station was rebuilt in 2001 and is home to an inshore lifeboat; a larger all-weather Tamar class boat is kept moored just off shore.  Railway  The Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway (B,WH&A;,R) was most unusual amongst British railways in that although it was built as a standard gauge line (4 ft in) it was not joined to the rest of the railway network, despite the London and South Western Railway having a station at Bideford, East-the-Water, meaning on the other side of the River Torridge from the main town. The line was wholly situated on the peninsula made up of Westward Ho!, Northam and Appledore with extensive sand dunes, at the mouth of the Torridge and Taw estuary. Appledore railway station and the whole line closed in 1917 having been requisitioned by the War Office (Stuckey 1962).

Frank Baum and illustrated by W. W. Denslow. Oz consists of four vast quadrants, the Gillikin Country in the north, Quadling Country in the south, Munchkin Country in the east and Winkie Country in the west. Each province has its own ruler, but the realm itself has always been ruled by a single monarch. After The Marvelous Land of Oz, this monarch is Princess Ozma. Originally, Baum did not intend for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to have any sequels, but it achieved a greater popularity than any of the other fairylands he created, including the land of Merryland in Baum's children's novel Dot and Tot in Merryland, written a year later. Due to Oz's worldwide success, Baum decided to return to it four years after The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was published. For the next two decades, he described and expanded upon the land in the Oz Books,James Thurber, \\"The Wizard of Chitenango\\", in Fantasists on Fantasy, edited by Robert H. Boyer and Kenneth J. Zahorski, New York, Avon, 1984; pp. 64–65. . a series which introduced many fictional characters and creatures. Baum intended to end the series with the sixth Oz book The Emerald City of Oz (1910), in which Oz is forever sealed off and made invisible to the outside world, but this did not sit well with fans, and he quickly abandoned the idea, writing eight more successful Oz books, and even naming himself the \\"Royal Historian of Oz.\\"Thurber, \\"The Wizard of Chitenango\\", p. 66. In all, Baum wrote fourteen best-selling children's books about Oz and its enchanted inhabitants, as well as a spin off-series of six early readers. After his death in 1919, author Ruth Plumly Thompson, illustrator John R. Neill (who had previously collaborated with Baum on his Oz books) and several other writers and artists continued the series. There are now over 50 novels based upon Baum's original Oz saga. Baum characterized Oz as a real place, unlike MGM's 1939 musical movie adaptation, which presents it as a dream of lead character Dorothy Gale. According to the Oz books, it is a hidden fairyland cut off from the rest of the world by the Deadly Desert. The canonical demonym for Oz is \\"Ozite\\". The term appears in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, The Road to Oz, and The Emerald City of Oz. Elsewhere in the canon, \\"Ozmie\\" is also used. In the animated 1974 semi-sequel to the MGM film, Journey Back to Oz, \\"Ozonian\\" is used. The term \\"Ozian\\" appears in the script for the Royal Shakespeare Company's stage adaptation of the MGM movie and in the modern work Wicked. \\"Ozmite\\" was used in Reilly & Lee marketing in the 1920s, which has suggested to some critics that \\"Ozmie\\" may have been a typographical error. Characteristics Oz is, in the first book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, distinguished from Dorothy's native Kansas by not being civilized; this explains why Kansas does not have witches and wizards, while Oz does.Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997; p. 53. . In the third book, Ozma of Oz, Oz is described as a \\"fairy country\\", new terminology that remained to explain its wonders.Riley, p. 138. Geography The Land of Oz The Land of Oz; note that the map is a mirror image of \\"actual\\" locations, but that the compass rose shows east on the right-hand side. Oz is roughly rectangular in shape, and divided along the diagonals into four countries: Munchkin Country (but commonly referred to as 'Munchkinland' in adaptations) in the East, Winkie Country in the West (sometimes West and East are reversed on maps of Oz, see West and East below), Gillikin Country in the North, and Quadling Country in the South. In the center of Oz, where the diagonals cross, is the fabled Emerald City, capital of the land of Oz and seat to the monarch of Oz, Princess Ozma.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, New York, St. Martin's Griffin, 1999; \\"Oz\\", p. 739. . The regions have a color scheme: blue for Munchkins, yellow for Winkies, red for Quadlings, green for the Emerald City, and (in works after the first) purple for the Gillikins, which region was also not named in the first book.Riley, p. 53. (This contrasts with Kansas; Baum, describing it, used \\"gray\\" nine times in four paragraphs.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 92.) In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, this is merely the favorite color, used for clothing and other man-made objects, and having some influence on their choice of crops, but the basic colors of the world are natural colors. The effect is less consistent in later works. In The Marvelous Land of Oz, the book states that everything in the land of the Gillikins is purple, including the plants and mud, and a character can see that he is leaving when the grass turns from purple to green, but it also describes pumpkins as orange and corn as green in that land.Riley, p. 105. Baum, indeed, never used the color scheme consistently; in many books, he alluded to the colors to orient the characters and readers to their location, and then did not refer to it again.Riley, p. 106. His most common technique was to depict the man-made articles and flowers as the color of the country, leaving leaves, grass, and fruit their natural colors.Riley, p. 155. Most of these regions are settled with prosperous and contented people. However, this naturally is lacking in scope for plot. Numerous pockets throughout the Land of Oz are cut off from the main culture, for geographic or cultural reasons. Many have never heard of Ozma, making it impossible for them to acknowledge her as their rightful queen. These regions are concentrated around the edges of the country, and constitute the main settings for books that are set entirely within Oz.Riley, p. 177. The Lost Princess of Oz, for instance is set entirely in rough country in Winkie Country, between two settled areas.Riley, p. 209. In Glinda of Oz, Ozma speaks of her duty to discover all these stray corners of Oz.Riley, p. 223. In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a yellow brick road leads from the lands of the Munchkins to the Emerald City. Other such roads featured in other works: one from Gillikin Country in The Marvelous Land of Oz, and a second one from Munchkin Land in The Patchwork Girl of Oz.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 107. Oz is completely surrounded on all four sides by a desert which insulates the citizens of the Land of Oz from discovery and invasion. In the first two books, this is merely a natural desert, with only its extent making it dangerous to the traveler, but in The Road to Oz it is said to turn anyone who touches it to sand.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 106. Indeed, in The Marvelous Land of Oz, Mombi tries to escape through it and Glinda chases her over the sands. Still, it is the dividing land between the magic of Oz and the outside world, and the Winged Monkeys can not obey Dorothy's command to carry her home because it would take them outside the lands of Oz.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 293. In Ozma of Oz, it has become a magical desert called the Deadly Desert with life-destroying sands and noxious fumes, a feature that remained constant through the rest of the series, although no actual destruction is depicted in the Oz books, unlike in the film Return to Oz.Riley, p. 139. The desert has nonetheless been breached numerous times, both by children from our world (mostly harmless), by the Wizard of Oz himself, and by more sinister characters, such as the Nome King, who attempted to conquer Oz. After such an attempt in The Emerald City of Oz, the book ends with Glinda creating a barrier of invisibility around the Land of Oz, for further protection.The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Oz\\", p. 740. This was, indeed, an earnest effort on Baum's part to end the series, but the insistence of readers meant the continuation of the series, and therefore the discovery of many ways for people to pass through this barrier as well as over the sands. Despite this continual evasion, the barrier itself remained; nowhere in any Oz book did Baum hint that the inhabitants were even considering removing the magical barrier. West and East The first known map of Oz was a glass slide used in Baum's Fairylogue and Radio-Play traveling show, showing the blue land of the Munchkins in the east and the yellow land of the Winkies in the west. These directions are confirmed by the text of all of Baum's Oz books, especially the first, in which the Wicked Witch of the East rules over the Munchkins, and the Wicked Witch of the West rules over the Winkies. Like traditional western maps, the Fairylogue and Radio-Play map showed the west on the left, and the east on the right. However, the first map of Oz to appear in an Oz book had those directions reversed, and the compass rose adjusted accordingly.Riley, p. 186. It is believed that this is a result of Baum copying the map from the wrong side of the glass slide, effectively getting a mirror image of his intended map. When he realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the compass rose to make the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the compass rose, thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further confusion. Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who frequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result. Another speculation stems from the original conception of Oz, which at first appeared to be situated in an American desert. If Baum thought of the country of the Munchkins as the nearest region to him, it would have been in the east while he lived in Chicago, but when he moved to California, it would have been in the west.Riley, p. 167. Modern maps of Oz are almost universally drawn with the Winkies in the west and the Munchkins in the east, although west and east often appear reversed. Many Oz fans believe this is the correct orientation, perhaps as a result of Glinda's spell, which has the effect of confusing most standard compasses; perhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found through the looking glass in which everything was a mirror image; or perhaps just reflecting the alien nature of Oz. In Robert A. Heinlein's book The Number of the Beast he posits that Oz is on a retrograde planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so that the sun seems to rise on one's left as one faces north. March Laumer's The Magic Mirror of Oz attributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to turn the Land of Oz orange. Location Oz, like all of Baum's fantasy countries, was presented as existing as part of the real world, albeit protected from civilization by natural barriers.Riley, p. 37. Indeed, in the first books, nothing indicated that it was not hidden in the deserts of the United States. It gradually acquired neighboring magical countries, often from works of Baum's that had been independent, as Ix from Queen Zixi of Ix, and Mo from The Magical Monarch of Mo.Riley, p. 228. The first of these is Ev, introduced in Ozma of Oz. Oz and surrounding countries, on the map from Tik-Tok of Oz (The directional indicator in the map's corner shows North and South correctly, but it flips East to the left, and West to the right). In Tik-Tok of Oz, Baum included maps in the endpapers which definitively situated Oz on a continent with its neighboring countries.Riley, pp. 186–7. Oz is the largest country on the continent unofficially known as Nonestica (this name was proposed by Robert R. Pattrick for the whole of the countries surrounding Oz; Pattrick proposed \\"Ozeria\\" for the whole continent,Robert R. Pattrick, \\"Oz Geography,\\" The Baum Bugle, Vol. 3 No. 1 (May 1959) to Vol. 4 No. 1 (May 1960). but that name is generally unused in fan discussions), which also includes the countries of Ev, Ix, and Mo, which has also been known as Phunniland, among others. Nonestica is, according to the map, in the Nonestic Ocean. A fair amount of evidence in the books point to this continent as being envisioned as somewhere in the southern Pacific Ocean.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 99. At the opening of Ozma of Oz, Dorothy Gale is sailing to Australia with her Uncle Henry when she is washed overboard (in a chicken coop, with Billina the yellow hen), and lands on the shore of Ev—a rare instance in which an outsider reaches the Oz landmass through non- magical (or apparently non-magical) means. Palm trees grow outside the Royal Palace in the Emerald City, and horses are not native to Oz, both points of consistency with a South-Pacific location; illustrations and descriptions of round-shaped and domed Ozite houses suggest a non-Western architecture. Conversely, Oz has technological, architectural, and urban elements typical of Europe and North America around the turn of the twentieth century; but this may involve cultural input from unusual external sources (see History below). Ruth Plumly Thompson asserts in her first Oz book, The Royal Book of Oz, that the language of Oz is English, which also suggests European or American influence. An argument against the South Pacific is that the seasons in Oz are shown as the same seasons in the United States at the same time. In addition, in The Wishing Horse of Oz, Pigasus follows the North Star when he flies to Thunder Mountain, which could only be done in the Northern Hemisphere. Inspiration Baum's creation of the Emerald City may have been inspired by the White City of the World Columbian Exposition, which he visited frequently. Its quick building, in less than a year, may have been an element in the quick construction of the Emerald City in the first book.Riley, p. 57. Schematically, Oz is much like the United States, with the Emerald City taking the place of Chicago: to the East, mixed forest and farmland; to the West, treeless plains and fields of wheat; to the South, warmth and lush growth, and red earth. Ruth Plumly Thompson took a different direction with her Oz books, introducing European elements such as the title character of The Yellow Knight of Oz, a knight straight out of Arthurian Legend. Witches and wizards The Wicked Witch of the West melts, from the William Wallace Denslow illustration in the first edition of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) At the time of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the lands in the North, South, East and West of Oz are each ruled by a Witch. The Witches of the North and South are good, while the Witches of the East and West are wicked. Glinda (the Good Witch of the South) is later revealed to be the most powerful of the four, although later Oz books reveal that the Wicked Witch of the West was so powerful, even Glinda feared her. After Dorothy's house crushes the Wicked Witch of the East, thereby liberating the Munchkins from bondage, the Good Witch of the North tells Dorothy that she (the Witch of the North) is not as powerful as the Wicked Witch of the East had been, or she would have freed the Munchkins herself. During the first scene in Oz in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Good Witch of the North (Locasta or Tattypoo) explains to Dorothy that Oz still has witches and wizards, not being civilized, and goes on to explain that witches and wizards can be both good and evil, unlike the evil witches that Dorothy had been told of.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 102. That book contained only the four witches (besides the humbug wizard), but despite Ozma's prohibition on magic, many more magicians feature in later works. Baum tended to capitalize the word \\"Witch\\" when referring to the Witches of the North, South, East or West, but did not do so when referring to witches in general. For example, in the aforementioned first scene of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Locasta (or Tattypoo) thanks Dorothy for killing the \\"Wicked Witch of the East\\", and introduces herself as \\"the Witch of the North\\", with the word \\"Witch\\" capitalized in both cases. However, when she goes on to tell Dorothy that \\"I [the Witch of the North] am a good witch, and the people love me\\", the word \\"witch\\" is not capitalized. White is the traditional color of witches in Oz. The Good Witch of the North wears a pointed white hat and a white gown decorated with stars, while Glinda, the Good Witch of the South (called a \\"sorceress\\" in later books), wears a pure white dress. Dorothy is taken for a witch not only because she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East, but because her dress is blue and white checked.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 115. Ozma, once on the throne, prohibits the use of magic by anyone other than Glinda the Good, the Wizard of Oz, and herself – as, earlier, the Good Witch of the North had prohibited magic by any other witch in her domains.Riley, pp. 177–8. The illicit use of magic is a frequent feature of villains in later works in the series, appearing in The Scarecrow of Oz, Rinkitink in Oz, The Lost Princess of Oz, The Tin Woodman of Oz, and The Magic of Oz.Jack Zipes, When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition, London, Routledge, 1998; pp. 180–1. . Animals There are different kinds of animals living in Oz. According to Baum, all animals in Oz have the ability to speak because it is a \\"fairy\\" kingdom. When asked by his readers why Dorothy's dog Toto did not speak, Baum insisted that he had the ability to, but did not choose to speak, but he finally does so in Tik-Tok of Oz. Among the many animals in Oz are: * A-B-Sea Serpent – A long sea serpent that is composed of alphabet blocks. * Chiss – An evil porcupine spirit that can launch his quills. * Choggenmugger - Thick, hard scales cover its body. It has wide jaws, sharp teeth. A dragon-eater that ate all dragons, serpents and crocodiles on the Regos Island to extinction. * Comfortable Camel – A bactrian camel from outside of Oz, who found his way into Oz, along with the Doubtful Dromedary, and they joined Dorothy Gale's party to find the Scarecrow. He almost always feels comfortable during his eventful journey. * Cowardly Lion – The Cowardly Lion is one of Dorothy Gale's friends. * Crab – A crab ended up in an argument with a Zebra to determine if the world had more water, or more land * Doubtful Dromedary – A dromedary from outside of Oz, who found his way into Oz, along with the Comfortable Camel, and they joined Dorothy Gale's party to find the Scarecrow. He doubts nearly everything that anyone says. * Dragons – Dragons are the toughest creatures in the Land of Oz and its neighboring countries. The ones in Gillikin Country live underground and are allowed to come out once every 100 years in search of food. * Field Mice – The Tin Man once saved the Queen of the Field Mice from a wildcat. Her kind later helps Dorothy and her friends get out of a deadly poppy field. The mice also reappear in the Marvelous Land of Oz to help the Scarecrow on his quest to reclaim his throne from General Jinjur, by hiding inside his clothes and jumping out to scare Jinjur's guards. * Foolish Owl – The Foolish Owl lives in Munchkin Country. She and the Wise Donkey are public advisers. * Giant Purple Spiders – A race of spiders in Gillikin Country that catch travelers in their webs and make them their servants. * Glass Cat – A glass sculpture brought to life by the Powder of Life. * Gump – Gumps are common creatures in the Land of Oz. They are elk-like creatures with wide-spreading antlers, caprine whiskers, and a turned-up nose. * Hippocampus – A race of half-horse half-fish aquatic creatures that live in Lake Orizon within Munchkin Country. The lake monster Quiberon once ate them into extinction. After Quiberon was turned to stone by the Wizard of Oz, he used his magic to reconstitute the bones of the Hippocampuses, causing their species to live once more. * Hip-po-gy-raf – A Hip-po-gy-raf lives in Munchkin Country west of Mount Munch. It appears to be a combination of a hippopotamus and a giraffe. * Hungry Tiger – The Hungry Tiger is the Cowardly Lion's best friend. * Jackdaws – A bunch of Jackdaws live in Quadling Country. * Kabumpo – The elegant elephant of Pumperdink. * Kalidahs – The Kalidahs have the head and back legs of a tiger and the arms, torso, and feet of a bear. Their claws are known to rip a lion in half. * Kangaroo – A mittens-wearing kangaroo lives near the village of Fuddlecumjig. * Lonesome Duck – The Lonesome Duck is the only duck in the Land of Oz. * Orks – Orks are unusual flying animals that have the blended characteristics of a common ostrich and a parrot. * Rak – A terrible beast with a horrible appetite and a bad disposition. It is said to be bigger than 100 men and can eat any living thing. * Rattlesnake – A rattlesnake serves as a companion of the A-B- Sea Serpent. * Squirrel King – The King of the Squirrels that live in Winkie Country. * Stork – A stork once helped Dorothy and her companions rescue Scarecrow. * Unicorns – A group of unicorns that live at Unicorners within Munchkin Country. * Winged Monkeys – Monkeys with bird wings. They obey the owner of the Golden Cap that summons them three times. * Wise Donkey – The Wise Donkey was a former citizen of the Land of Mo who often advised the King of Mo. He now lives in Munchkin Country with the Foolish Owl. * Zebra – A Zebra ended up in an argument with a Crab to determine if there was either more water in the world or more land. Other races There is a multitude of other races living in the land of Oz, many of which only appear once. Among the known races are: * The Bun People of Bunbury – The Bun People are made of baked goods. * The Bunnies of Bunnybury – A race of civilized rabbits. * The China People – A race of beings that are made of china (porcelain) that live in Quadling Country. * The Cuttenclips – A race of living paper dolls that live in Quadling Country. * The Dicks – The topsy-turvy inhabitants of Dicksy Land. * The Equinots – A race of centaurs. * The Flatheads – A race of flat- headed humans who carry their brains in cans. * The Flutterbudgets – A race of people who entertain foolish fears and spend time worrying over nothing. * The Fuddles – A race of anthropomorphic jigsaw puzzles that live in Fuddlecumjig. * The Hammerheads – An armless race with extensible necks and hard heads. * The Hoopers – A race of 10 ft. tall humanoids that live in the Purple Forest of Gillikin Country and can roll into hoops by grabbing their toes with their hands. * The Hoppers – A race of one-legged people that live inside a mountain in Quadling Country. * The Horners – A race of strange one-horned people that live inside a mountain in Quadling Country. * The Hyups – A subspecies of Munchkins that live on Mount Munch. * The Loons – A race of living balloon people that live in Loonville. * The Magical Mimics – A race of evil shape- shifting creatures that are a type of Erb that live on Mount Illuso. * The Middlings - A race of large mud creatures with dry grass hair that live beneath the surface of Munchkin Country. * The Phanfasms – A magically powerful race of Erb spirits that change their appearance into beasts. * The Rigmaroles – A race of people that make long deliberate speeches which makes use of many words. * The Scares – A race of grotesque beings that reside in Scare City within Quadling Country. * The Scooters – A race of people that live on the waters of the Gillikin River. They have long boat-like feet and have sails growing from their wrists to their ribs. * The Skeezers – A race of anatomically normal humans who are often in conflicts with the Flatheads. * The Sticks-in-the-Muds – A tribe of mud-covered people on stilts that live in Marsh Land within Winkie Country. * The Thists – A race of creatures that has diamond-shaped heads and heart-shaped bodies that live in Thi. * The Tottenhots – A race of small mischievous people who live on the borders of Quadling Country and Winkie Country. * The Utensians – A race of living utensils that live in Utensia in Quadling Country. * The Yips – A small community of people that resemble the Hyups. Outside of them are many other strange races who are often found living in the wilderness of Oz. Despite the overlordship of Ozma, many of the communities live autonomously. Oz has great tolerance for eccentricity and oddness.Zipes, p. 165. Many characters in Oz are animated objects. Such figures as the Glass Cat, the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and others are common. Entire regions are the homes of such animated beings. The Dainty China Country is entirely filled with creatures made of china, who would freeze into figurines if removed. The China Princess lives in fear of breaking because she would never be as pretty again, even if repaired.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 311. Many other characters are highly individual, even unique members of a species. Many such people from the outer worlds find refuge in Oz, which is highly tolerant of eccentricity.Riley, p. 154. History Prehistory The history of Oz prior to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (often called the prehistory of Oz as it takes place before Baum's \\"histories\\") is often the subject of dispute, as Baum himself gave conflicting accounts. In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the title character recounts that he was a ventriloquist and a circus balloonist from Omaha, and during one flight the rope for his parachute vent became tangled, preventing him from descending until the next morning, and he awoke to find that he was floating over a strange land. When he landed, the people thought he was a great wizard because of his ability to fly. He did not disabuse them of this notion, and with his new power over them, he had them build a city with a palace in the center of Oz. He also ordered them to wear green glasses so it would appear to be made entirely of emeralds. However, in the later Oz books the city is depicted as actually being made of emerald or other green materials. The Wizard was a young man when he first arrived in Oz, and grew old while he was there.Riley, p. 146. Afraid of the Wicked Witches of the West and the East, who, unlike him, could do real magic, the Wizard hid away in a room of his palace and refused to see visitors. He lived in this way until the arrival of Dorothy in the first book. In The Marvelous Land of Oz the prehistory was changed slightly. Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, reveals that the Wizard usurped the previous king of Oz Pastoria and hid away his daughter Ozma. This was Baum's reaction to the popular 1903 Broadway extravaganza Baum adapted from his book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, in which the Wizard took the role of the main antagonist and the Wicked Witch of the West was left out. The Wizard, however, had been more popular with his readers than he thought. In Ozma of Oz, he omitted any mention of the Wizard's having usurped the throne of Ozma's father,Riley, p. 140. but the largest changes occurred in the next book. In the preface to Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, Baum remarks that the Wizard had turned out to be a popular character with the children who had read the first book and so he brought the Wizard back. During it, the Wizard relates yet another account of his history in Oz, telling Ozma that his birth name was Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs, which, being a very long and cumbersome name, and as his other initials spelled out \\"PINHEAD,\\" he preferred to leave just as O.Z. The balloon part of his story was unchanged, except for the detail added by Ozma, that the people probably saw his initials on his balloon and took them as a message that he was to be their king. She relates that the country was already named Oz (a word which in their language means \\"great and good\\"), and that it was typical for the rulers to have names that are variations of Oz (King Pastoria being a notable exception to this rule). Ozma elaborates further, saying that there were once four Wicked Witches in Oz, who leagued together to depose the King, but the Wicked Witches of the North and South were defeated by Good Witches before the Wizard arrived in Oz. According to this version, the King at the time was Ozma's grandfather. This version of prehistory restores the Wizard's reputation, but adds the awkwardness of both Ozma and her father having been born in captivity. In The Tin Woodman of Oz Baum writes how Oz came to be a fairyland: :Oz was not always a fairyland, I am told. Once it was much like other lands, except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it, thus preventing its people from all contact with the rest of the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of Queen Lurline, passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about it. Thenceforward, no one in Oz would ever age, get sick, or die. After becoming a fairyland, Oz harbored many Witches, Magicians, and Sorcerers until the time when Ozma made magic illegal without a permit. In yet another inconsistency, it is implied that Ozma was the fairy left behind by Queen Lurline to rule the country, contradicting the story where she was Pastoria's daughter. This is later confirmed in Glinda of Oz: :\\"If you are really Princess Ozma of Oz,\\" the Flathead said, \\"you are one of that band of fairies who, under Queen Lurline, made all Oz a Fairyland. I have heard that Lurline left one of her own fairies to rule Oz, and gave the fairy the name of Ozma.\\" While this explains why no one dies or ages, and nevertheless there are people of differing ages in Oz, it is completely inconsistent with the earlier versions of the prehistory.Riley, pp. 216–17. Maguire, author of Wicked addresses this inconsistency by saying that the people of Oz believe that Ozma is reincarnated—that her spirit was left behind by Lurline, but her body is reborn to different mortal queens. In Jack Snow's The Magical Mimics in Oz, the prehistory story is retold. This version relates that Ozma was given to the king of Oz as an adoptive daughter, for he was old and had no children. In the Magic Land stories of Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, the prehistory is quite different. The land was created 6,000–7,000 years ago by a wizard named Hurricap, who was tired of people coming to him with requests, so he decided to find a place without them annoying him. He found a remote land and separated it from the rest of the world, along with putting the enchantments of eternal spring and talking animals (Volkov's version doesn't include any forms of immortality). However, he failed to notice that the land already contained people (since he was a giant, already suffering from nearsightedness in his advanced age, and the people in the Magic Land were much shorter than in other places), but, upon discovering the fact, decided that removing the enchantments would be unnecessary. Instead, he ordered the people to keep away from his castle. After that, the notable events included a conquest attempt by a sorceress named Arachna (Gurrikap was still alive, and put her in an enchanted sleep for 5,000 years. Her awakening formed the story for the fifth book in Volkov's series), an unsuccessful coup by a prince named Bofaro to overthrow his father about 1,000 years ago (He and his accomplices were banished to a cave and became the Magic Land's main source of metal and gems, an analogue to the Nomes), and the arrival of the Four Witches (which only occurred about 500 years ago in this continuity). History through the first six books Eventually, Dorothy Gale and her whole house are blown into Oz from Kansas by a tornado. When the house lands, it crushes the Wicked Witch of the East, ruler of the Munchkins. In an attempt to get back to her home, she journeys to the Emerald City. Along the way, she meets the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow, all of whom accompany her. Once there, they become the first people to gain an audience with the Wizard since he went into seclusion, although he disguises himself because Dorothy now has the Wicked Witch of the East's magic silver shoes, and he is afraid of her. The Wizard sends Dorothy and her party to destroy the Wicked Witch of the West and in exchange promises to grant her request to be sent home. Surprisingly, Dorothy \\"destroys\\" the Witch by throwing a pail of water on her, causing her to melt. Defeated, the Wizard reveals to the group that he is in fact not a real wizard and has no magical powers, but he promises to grant Dorothy's wish and take her home himself in his balloon. He leaves the Scarecrow in his place to rule Oz. Finally, it is discovered that the wizard had given the daughter of the last king of Oz, Princess Ozma, to the old witch Mombi to have her hidden away. Mombi had turned Ozma into a boy named Tip, whom she raised. When all of this is revealed Tip is turned back into Ozma and takes her rightful place as the benevolent ruler of all of Oz. Ozma successfully wards off several attempts by various armies to overthrow her. To prevent any upheaval of her rule over Oz, she outlaws the practice of all magic in Oz except by herself, the returned and reformed wizard, and by Glinda, and she has Glinda make all of Oz invisible to outsiders. Ozma remains the ruler of Oz for the entire series. The Royal flag of Oz, as described in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz Economy and politics Some political analysts have claimed that Oz is a thinly disguised socialist utopia, though some Baum scholars disagree.Frequently Asked Questions The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website. Advocates of this theory support it using this quotation from The Emerald City of Oz: :There were no poor people in the land of Oz, because there was no such thing as money, and all property of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced. This is a revision of the original society: in the first two books, the people of Oz lived in a money-based economy. For instance, the people of the Emerald City use \\"green pennies\\" as coinage.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 202. Money was not abolished in the course of the series, but excised from the conception of Oz.Riley, p. 156. Indeed, in The Magic of Oz, a character from Oz gets into trouble when he goes to Ev because he was unaware of the concept of money.Riley, p. 220. This decision to remove money from Oz may reflect Baum's own financial difficulties in the times when he was writing these books. Since Oz is ruled by a monarch, benevolent though she may be, Oz is closer in nature to an absolute monarchy than a communist or Marxist state.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 75. When she was first introduced, Ozma was the monarch specifically of the Emerald City, but in the description of Ozma of Oz, Oz is presented as a federal state, rather like the German Empire, in monarchies rather than republics: having an overall ruler in Ozma, and individual kings and queens of smaller portions.Riley, pp. 139–40. The society grew steadily more utopian, in that its peace and prosperity were organized, but from the first book, it was a stupendously wealthy country, in contrast to Kansas's crop failures, droughts, and mortgages—just as it also is colorful to contrast with Kansas's gray.Brian Attebery, The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature, Bloomington, IN, Indiana University Press, 1980; p. 85. . On the other hand, despite the presence of the Emerald City, Oz is an agrarian country, similar to Kansas; the story has been interpreted as a populist parable, and certainly contains many populist themes.Attebery, pp. 86–7. In The Wonder City of Oz, Princess Ozma (called \\"Queen Ozma\\" in this book) is seen running for election (\\"ozlection\\") to her office as ruler against Jenny Jump, a half-fairy newcomer from New Jersey. However, this book was not written by Baum, but by John R. Neill, Baum's second successor. Further, the concept of the \\"ozlection\\" was not in Neill's manuscript for the book, but was added by an editor at Reilly and Lee, the publisher. At times the rulers of Oz's territories have grander titles than would normally be customary, but this is done mostly for the satisfaction of the incumbents. The ruler of the Winkie Country is the Emperor, the Tin Woodman. The ruler of the Quadling Country is Glinda the Good. The Munchkin Country is ruled by a king, later identified as Cheeriobed, who is revealed to be married to the Good Witch of the North, who, a spell broken, abdicates leadership of the Gillikin Country to Joe King and Queen Hyacinth of Up Town.The Giant Horse of Oz. The Royal Flag of Oz is based on the map of the Land of Oz; the four colors represent the four countries, and the green star represents the Emerald City. Defense Oz is mostly a peaceful land and the idea of subversion is largely unknown to its people. Most military positions are only formal. This has caused many problems, such as in The Marvelous Land of Oz when the Emerald City (which was only guarded by an elderly doorman and one soldier who was the entire Army of Oz at the time) was easily conquered by the Army of Revolt led by General Jinjur. This army was in turn overwhelmed by another army of girls led by Glinda. Security of Oz is mostly maintained by magic such as Glinda's spell making Oz completely invisible. Oz also has a natural barrier in the form of a desert that surrounds the land: anyone who touches the desert turns to sand. The Nome King has tried to conquer Oz on several occasions. A nominal army once existed, but it had an extremely large officers/privates ratio; other than its commander the Tin Woodman and one private, the portion of it seen in Ozma of Oz was composed entirely of cowardly officers. In the end of the book it was said that there are three privates all in all, and it is unknown how many—if any—officers were left at home during Ozma's travel to Ev. The private seen in the book, named Omby Amby, is later promoted to Captain General. In the book Emerald City of Oz, there are 2 towns called Rigmarole Town and Flutterbudgets that are the defensive settlements of Oz. In the movie Return to Oz, the mechanical man Tik-Tok is the entire Royal Army of Oz. Attempts by outsiders to conquer the Land of Oz are frequent, particularly in the Oz books by Ruth Plumly Thompson. But these attempts are always successfully thwarted in the end, usually by Ozma or by forces sympathetic to her. Characters Recurring characters in the classic Oz series include: * Dorothy Gale – A heroic little orphan girl from Kansas. In later Oz books, she eventually moves to Oz permanently after visiting the land several times and having several adventures there. Dorothy ultimately becomes best friends with Princess Ozma who proclaims her as an official princess of Oz. * Toto – Dorothy's little black dog whom she loves dearly. Toto is a sidekick companion, loyally following his mistress Dorothy on most of her adventures. It is revealed in \\"Tik-Tok of Oz\\" that even though Toto is not a fairy dog, he can still talk in Oz, he just chooses not to. * Princess Ozma – The long-lost child Queen and rightful ruler of Oz. She is the only child of Oz's deceased mortal king, Pastoria who ruled before the Wizard arrived. She is established upon the throne as the true heir shortly after The Wonderful Wizard of Oz takes place. *Uncle Henry – Dorothy's uncle who is a Kansas farmer and the husband of aunt Em. He ultimately moves to Oz with Dorothy and aunt Em when the bank forecloses on his farm. * Aunt Em – Dorothy's aunt, and the wife of uncle Henry. She ultimately moves to Oz with Dorothy and uncle Henry. * The Good Witch of the North – The elderly ruler of the northern Gillikins. She is known by Locasta Tattypoo and became the ruler of the Gillikin Country after she overthrew Mombi, the Wicked Witch of the North. She was also the first witch Dorothy encountered upon her first arrival in Oz in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. * The Scarecrow – A living stuffed man of straw who was made in Oz's eastern quadrant called Munchkin Country. He is also a good friend of Dorothy. At the end of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz he became the King of Oz and ruled its imperial capital called the Emerald City after the Wizard left. However, he gladly relinquished the title when Ozma was found. * The Tin Woodman (a.k.a. Nick Chopper) – An enchanted woodsman made entirely out of tin and is a good friend of Dorothy. He was originally a Munchkin but is the current Emperor of the western Winkies and lives in a tin castle. He became the official ruler of the Winkie Country after the Wicked Witch of the West was destroyed by Dorothy in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. * The Cowardly Lion – The talking lion who is a good friend of Dorothy. In the end of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, he became the King of the Beasts and overcame his cowardly ways. In later Oz books he becomes best friends with the Hungry Tiger; together they rule Oz's Animal Kingdom and are the royal chariot pullers for Princess Ozma. * The Wizard (Oscar Diggs) – The former ruler of Oz and the Emerald City before the Scarecrow and Princess Ozma. Originally a skilled circus entertainer and ventriloquist from Omaha, Nebraska, he used his magic tricks to create illusions that made it appear as if he had real powers. Once a humbug, he is now a real wizard after being trained by both Ozma and Glinda, who successfully taught him how to perform honest magic. * Glinda – The beautiful and wise Good Witch of the South who rules the southern Quadlings in a ruby palace. She became the benevolent sorceress of the Quadling Country after she vanquished the Wicked Witch of the South (although the classic MGM musical movie of 1939 incorrectly portrays her as the Good Witch of the North). *Guardian of the Gates – The friendly gate keeper responsible for adorning the visitors who wish to enter Oz's capital with the green-tinted spectacles.

Other media The 1939 MGM film's Oz The Land of Oz as portrayed in the classic MGM musical movie of 1939, is quite different from that portrayed in Baum's books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up by Dorothy Gale (thus making it a dream world), although, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one's home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family is not something that should be taken for granted. This contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of Kansas. There are many other small differences between the books and the movie. For example, when Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland the Munchkins are seen wearing colorful costumes, but in the book Munchkins are said to only wear blue as blue is the official dominant color of the east. The first witch Dorothy meets in Oz in the book is the Good Witch of the North, a minor character that only had one other appearance in Baum's books but is an important figure of Oz nonetheless. In the movie this character is conflated with that of Glinda, who is the Good Witch of the South and does not make an appearance until the very end of Baum's story. The character of Glinda in the books dresses in all white silk, as white is the traditional color for good witches, whereas in the film she is seen in pink. It is also worthy of note that the Dorothy of the books is only a little girl who is no older than twelve-years-old. However, she is mature and very resourceful, only crying when faced with ultimate despair, whereas the older Dorothy of the movie (portrayed as a twelve-year-old by sixteen- year-old Judy Garland) spends several portions of the film crying and being told by others what to do, however her fear was overshadowed by the Cowardly Lion's. This is more consistent with Thompson's portrayal of Dorothy—Baum is known for his strong and independent female characters. The Wicked Witch of the West is portrayed in the book as having only one eye, which is so powerful it could see distant objects like a telescope, but in the movie she uses a crystal ball to watch Dorothy and her friends from afar. The 1939 MGM film makes the first reference to The Witches of the East and West being sisters, which was not the case in the book; none of the Witches in Baum's Oz are related. The Wizard of Oz does not resort to anywhere near as much trickery in the movie as the book. In the book he entertains each member of Dorothy's party on a different day, and takes a different form for each; appearing as a giant green head, a beautiful fairy, a great beast, and a levitating ball of fire. In the movie he takes only one of these forms—that of the giant green head. The nature of the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not actually all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie there is only a gate opening. The movie replaces the charmed Silver Shoes with pointed toes of the book with Ruby-Red Slippers. This was because full color motion pictures were still a relatively new technology in 1939, and MGM wanted to show off the visually dazzling process. Shiny red shoes were more impressive in a color motion picture compared to silver ones. Due to the popularity of the movie, the green witch and the Ruby Slippers are more well known to the general public and pop culture than their book counterparts, and are even considered iconic. Gregory Maguire's revisionist Oz In his revisionist Oz novels Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, Son of a Witch, A Lion Among Men and Out of Oz, Gregory Maguire portrays a very different version of the Land of Oz. Maguire's Oz is not Baum's utopia, but a land troubled by political unrest and economic hardship. One political issue in Maguire's novels is the oppression of the Animals (Maguire distinguishes speaking Animals from non-speaking animals by the use of initial capital letters). There are many religious traditions in Maguire's Oz, including Lurlinism (which regards the Fairy Lurline as Oz's creator), Unionism, which worships the Unnamed God, and the pleasure faiths which had swept Oz during the time that the witches were at Shiz. An example of the pleasure faiths were tic-toc (where creatures were enchanted to tell secrets or the future and run by clockwork), and sorcery. Maguire's presentation of Oz's geography is also tinged with politics. A large political prison, Southstairs, exists in caverns below the Emerald City. Gillikin, home of Shiz University, has more industrial development than other parts of Oz. Munchkinland is Oz's breadbasket and at one point declares its independence from the rule of the Emerald City. Quadling Country is largely marshland, inhabited by the artistic and sexually free Quadlings. The Vinkus (Maguire's name for Winkie Country) is largely open grassland, populated by semi-nomadic tribes with brown skin. The musical Wicked, based on Maguire's first Oz novel, portrays an Oz slightly closer to the version seen in Baum's novels and the 1939 film. The oppression of the Animals is still a theme, but the geographical and religious divisions portrayed in Maguire's novel are barely present. In both the book and musical, several characters from the traditional Oz stories are present with different names. Glinda is originally called Galinda, but changes her name. The Wicked Witch of the West is called Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the East is called Nessarose. In the musical, but not in the book, Boq becomes the Tin Man, and Fiyero becomes the Scarecrow. Alexander Melentyevich Volkov's Magic Land Alexander Melentyevich Volkov was a Russian author best known for his translation of The Wizard of Oz into Russian, and for writing his own original sequels, which were based only loosely on Baum's. Volkov's books have been translated into many other languages, and are better known than Baum's in some countries. The books, while still aimed at children, feature many mature political and ethical elements. They have been retranslated into English by Peter L. Blystone and partially by March Laumer, who used elements of them in his own books. March Laumer's Oz March Laumer was one of the first authors to continue the Oz series after the Famous Forty. His books were written with the permission of Contemporary Books, who owned Reilly & Lee, the original publisher. His canon includes everything he knew of that was set in the land of Oz, including Volkov's Russian Oz, the MGM movie, the Disney sequel, and many of Baum's own books that most fans do not consider canonical. Laumer also made several controversial changes to Oz. He married off several of the major characters, often to unlikely prospects. For example, the intelligent and mature sorceress Glinda was married to Button Bright, who had been a small and dim-witted child throughout Baum's books. He also aged Dorothy to a teenager to make her a romantic prospect for several characters, made Ozma a lesbian based on her upbringing as a boy, and made the Shaggy Man an ephebophile based on his frequent travels with young girls. Laumer's books do not portray one consistent version of Oz. Because most of his books were collaborations, he often included elements of other author's visions of Oz which may have been inconsistent with his own. For example, while he explicitly made Dorothy sixteen in A Fairy Queen in Oz, he had her physically eight in Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz; and while he portrayed Volkov's Oz as a parallel universe in Farewell to Oz he also showed Volkov's characters living in Baum's Oz in many of his other books, such as Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz. Despite these discrepancies, many of his books are consistent with each other, and characters introduced in some often appear in others. Philip José Farmer's Oz Philip José Farmer portrays a very different Oz in his book A Barnstormer in Oz. The premise is that nothing after the first book occurred—Dorothy never returned to Oz, and instead grew up, got married, and had a son. Her son, Hank Stover, is the main character, a World War I veteran flier and the titular barnstormer. While flying in his Curtiss JN-4 biplane he enters a green haze and emerges in the civil war-stricken land of Oz. Farmer portrays the land of Oz as a science fiction author, attempting to explain scientifically many of the \\"magical\\" elements of Baum's story. Robert A. Heinlein's Oz The main characters of Robert A. Heinlein's books The Number of the Beast and The Pursuit of the Pankera pass through many famous fictional worlds including those of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland; Gulliver's Travels, specifically Lilliput; E.E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's Lensman universe; Asgard, connected to Heinlein's own Future History universe by the Rainbow Bridge for one specific reason in one specific location; and Ringworld; as well as some of Heinlein's own works, specifically those set in his Future History through which Lazarus Long moves; and of course the Land of Oz itself. The Oz portrayed in the book is very close to Baum's Oz, although Heinlein does make an attempt to explain some things from the standpoint of a science fiction author. He explains that Oz is on a retrograde planet, where the direction of rotation relative to the poles is reversed, resulting in the sun seeming to rise in what would normally be the west. Heinlein also explains that the population remains steady in Oz despite the lack of death because it is impossible for children to be born in Oz. When the population does increase through immigration, Glinda just extends the borders an inch or two in each direction, which makes more than enough space for all additional people. L. Sprague de Camp's Oz L. Sprague de Camp, like Heinlein, brings his own characters to Oz in his book Sir Harold and the Gnome King, part of the originally collaborative Harold Shea series. Unlike Heinlein, he does not attempt to explain Oz as science fiction, though he does deviate from the original corpus. He follows Thompson's Oz books, thus using her spelling of \\"Gnome\\" and her final fate of the character, but he postulates an incident that has removed the Ozites' immortality, with the result that both Ozma and Dorothy have aged and married by the time his story takes place. Tad Williams' Otherland Oz In the Otherland series, by Tad Williams, a virtual reality version of Oz exists, wherein real-world antagonists play sadistic versions of the roles of the Tin Man, The Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion, in a twisted, martial, and post-apocalyptic version of Oz, populated both by characters from the novels, and a large quantity of male and female humans who go by the names \\"Henry\\" and \\"Em\\" respectively. The humans, computer-generated characters based on the lost minds of children drawn into the Otherland program, look forward to a messianic prophecy foretelling the coming of \\"The Dorothy,\\" where a child would be born among them. The Outer Zone (Tin Man) The 2007 Sci Fi television miniseries Tin Man reinvents Oz as the Outer Zone (O.Z.), a parallel universe that was first visited by Dorothy Gale during the latter Victorian Era and is ruled over by her descendants. It is implied, by reference to centuries having elapsed since Dorothy came to the O.Z., that time has progressed at different rates in the O.Z. and \\"the other side\\". The re-imagined Oz is described as a place where \\"the paint has peeled, and what was once the goodness of Oz has become the horrible bleakness of the O.Z.\\"\\"A Touch More Evil: Azkadellia's World\\", SciFi Pulse video (Atom Films mirror) – November 13, 2007 The scenic design of the O.Z. features elements of steampunk, particularly the \\"1930s fascist realist\\" decor of the evil sorceress's palace and the computer-generated Central City, analogue of the Emerald City.\\"Brick by Brick: Bringing Tin Man to Life\\", SciFi Pulse video (YouTube mirror) – November 16, 2007 Emerald City Confidential The 2009 point-and-click adventure video game Emerald City Confidential reinvents Oz in a film noir style, with Dorothy Gale as a femme fatale, the Lion as a corrupt lawyer and some other changes.\\"Review of Emerald City Confidential\\", Adventure Gamers – February 23, 2009 Once Upon a Time The Land of Oz appears in the TV series Once Upon a Time and is the focus of the episodes \\"It's Not Easy Being Green\\", \\"Kansas\\", \\"Heart of Gold\\", \\"Our Decay\\", \\"Ruby Slippers\\", and the most recent episode \\"Where Bluebirds Fly\\". It was also seen briefly in the episode \\"Sisters\\". Magic of Oz Being a fantasy series Oz is rich in magic. In particular, there are many magic items which play an important role in the series. Silver Shoes/Ruby Slippers When Dorothy leaves Oz after having several adventures there and befriending many of Oz's natives, she is magically carried over the Deadly Desert by means of the charmed Silver Shoes she had been given shortly after her unexpected arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair's owner, the Wicked Witch of the East. After knocking her heels together three times and wishing to return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The shoes however, slip off of Dorothy's feet and are lost forever in the desert. Baum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film the shoes are changed to Ruby Slippers. When Dorothy clicks her heels together she closes her eyes and says: \\"There's no place like home\\". She then wakes up in her bedroom in Kansas believing her experience in Oz to be an elaborate dream. The silver shoes and ruby slippers are also used in several other versions including Wicked by Gregory Maguire. Here the shoes are constructed as a gift and have a chameleon effect. They are decorated with thousands of glittering glass beads that change colors according to the lighting. They can also appear to be several different colors all at once. The shoes are also lost when Dorothy is teleported back home just like in Baum's novel. The Broadway musical based on Maguire's book further shows that they were all silver, but were changed to ruby red by a spell put upon them by the Witch of the West Elphaba, enabling her sister the Witch of the East Nessarose, who prior had been confined to a wheelchair, to magically walk. A little-known adaptation of the original story made for British television in the mid-90s starring Denise van Outen explained that they had belonged to a visitor from over the rainbow who came to Oz before Dorothy and they were obtained by the Witch when the visitor wished herself home and they fell off her feet on the return trip. Powder of Life The Powder of Life is a magic substance from the book series, which first appears in The Marvelous Land of Oz. It is a magical powder that brings inanimate objects to life. The witch Mombi first obtained it from a \\"crooked magician.\\" Later in the series, it is revealed that the substance is made by a Dr. Pipt. In order to make the substance, Dr. Pipt had to stir four large cauldrons for six years. Only a few grains of the powder could be made at a time. It is always described as being carried in a pepper box. In The Marvelous Land of Oz, the Powder of Life was used to bring Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and the Gump to life. The first batch of the powder in Mombi's possession was activated by the following incantation and the action that had to be associated with: * Raise the left hand, little finger pointing upward, and say: \\"Weaugh!\\" * Raise the right hand, thumb pointing upward, and say: \\"Teaugh!\\" * Raise both hands, with all the fingers and thumbs spread out, and say: \\"Peaugh!\\" In The Road to Oz, the Dr. Pipt's sister Dyna activated the Powder of Life with a simple wish that brought the rug of her late blue bear pet to life. In The Patchwork Girl of Oz it brings the title character to life, also the glass cat and a phonograph. Mombi's shaker also contained three \\"wishing pills\\" fabricated by Dr. Nikidik. The Powder has been used by Volkov in his series. There, it is produced from a certain plant of such viability that the smallest piece can grow into a plant within a day, on any surface except for solid metal. However, if it is sun-dried on such a surface, it turns into the Powder of Life. No incantation is required to make the powder work. The second book of the series is centered around a man who animates an army of wooden soldiers with the Powder and uses them for conquering the Magic Land. In Return to Oz, the magic words to bring the inanimate object to life were \\"WEAUGH, TEAUGH, PEAUGH\\". Magic Belt The Magic Belt is first introduced in Ozma of Oz. Originally the belt belonged to the Nome King, but Dorothy Gale stole it and defeated him. When she leaves Oz, she gives it to Ozma for safekeeping. In most Oz books, the Magic Belt grants its wearer the ability to transform anyone into any form, and the ability to transport anyone anywhere, and also makes its wearer impervious to harm. In some books, it also grants limited wishes. In Ozma of Oz, its power is limited: its magic cannot affect objects which are made of wood. In non-canonical The Oz Kids animated series, the Magic Belt belonged to Dot. Magic Picture In Ozma's boudoir hangs a picture in a radium frame. This picture usually appears to be of a pleasant countryside, but when anyone wishes for the picture to show a particular person or place, the scene will display what is wished for. Sometimes the onlooker is able to hear sounds from the scene within the Magic Picture and sometimes an additional device is necessary to transmit sound. A similar device is present in Volkov's series. There, it is given as a present to the Scarecrow by the Good Witch of the South. It is a box of pink wood with a thick frosted glass screen. The device is password activated, and limited in range to the Magic Land (with the exception of deep caverns and certain types of magical interference). The box is shown to be virtually indestructible; it withstood repeated abuse from a villain attempting to use it. Great Book of Records Glinda's Great Book of Records is introduced in Chapter 29 of The Emerald City of Oz: \\" 'It is a record of everything that happens,' replied the Sorceress. 'As soon as an event takes place, anywhere in the world, it is immediately found printed in my Magic Book. So when I read its pages I am well informed.' \\" The Book proves useful in The Scarecrow of Oz and Glinda of Oz; and it recurs in many of the stories of Baum's successors and imitators. For instance, in The Number of the Beast, the Book is shown to cover more than simply Oz. It provided information concerning the \\"Black Hats\\" attempting to murder the four protagonists which enabled Glinda to devise a set of magical glasses requested by Hilda Burroughs that enable her to spot a Black Hat no matter how disguised. It is one of the prime magic devices of Oz; villains steal it when they can (as in The Lost Princess of Oz or in Handy Mandy in Oz). Since it covers the planet and not merely Oz, the Book's entries are compressed and sometimes cryptic, and difficult to decipher (as in Paradox in Oz or Queen Ann in Oz). The book is also featured in the fantasy series Once Upon a Time. Zelena reads the book ignoring Glinda's warning and turns green again because she felt betrayed as it was mentioned in the book that Dorothy would save Oz from a great evil (Zelena thought that evil was her but this was never revealed). The Love Magnet A rusty-looking horseshoe magnet which causes everyone to love its owner. It is closely associated with the Shaggy Man. In The Road to Oz, he finds that being loved by everyone can be inconvenient. In Tik-Tok of Oz he reveals that Ozma has modified its powers so that it only works when it is displayed and affects only the feelings of those who see it. It is an essential plot-element in The Shaggy Man of Oz. Ozma keeps it hanging over the gate into the Emerald City, so that all who enter will come with love, although this does not always seem to happen. Magic Fan The Magic Fan is brought to Oz by Dorothy in The Royal Book of Oz. Several subsequent books mention it. It creates a powerful wind, capable of blowing away an invading army. Fountain of Oblivion A fountain in the Emerald City, erected by the witch Glinda to reform a wicked king of Oz in the past. Anyone who drinks from it forgets everything he knows, including his own name. It appears in Baum's The Emerald City of Oz and The Magic of Oz, and also plays an important role in the later contributor stories The Forbidden Fountain of Oz, The Shaggy Man of Oz, The Wicked Witch of Oz, and Paradox in Oz. Magic Dinner Bell Created by the Red Jinn, it summons a slave named Ginger, who appears bearing a tray full of delicious food when the bell is rung. Besides providing food, the bell also provides a means of escape from danger: anyone who holds onto the slave when he disappears after bringing the food is transported with him to the Red Jinn's castle. There are actually two magic dinner bells, one in the Emerald City and another which the Red Jinn keeps for himself and uses while traveling. The bell is first introduced in Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz and also appears in The Purple Prince of Oz and The Silver Princess in Oz. Miscellaneous Death in Oz In the later Oz books, no one can die. One of the books assures us that while you are in the Land of Oz, you cannot die. Unfortunately, this information comes after characters in the books have been chopped into pieces, beheaded, melted, and so forth and it is mentioned that you could be transformed into an inanimate object, turned into sand, and buried. Even so, you would still be alive and presumably conscious. Baum puts it this way in the third chapter of The Emerald City of Oz: :\\"No disease of any sort was ever known among the Ozites, and so no one ever died unless he met with an accident that prevented him from living.\\" This passage has been translated by some fans to mean that one ceases to live if one's body is damaged to the extent that it cannot be repaired. However, in Tik-Tok of Oz Baum suggested that Oz people could go on living after being eaten and digested, and also that Nomes would continue to live after being cut into tiny pieces, which disproves the destruction theory. Note also the spell which caused this also prevented aging, and took effect on everyone in Oz at the same time; this means that any babies in Oz are eternally babies, and that anyone who was at the moment of death is permanently caught there, and so on. Theories Death is treated inconsistently; in some books it is said that it is impossible to die, in others, people die. Problematically, the plot often depends on something either dying, or not being killable. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz shows an early example of the problem: although the Tin Woodman does not die when his limbs and head are severed, the two wicked witches are killed (the Wicked Witch of the East could be explained that she was simply crushed and not really dead, but could not do anything anyway, and in The Oz Odyssey, the Wicked Witch of the West comes back to life). One theory brought forth as to why the Tin Woodman does not die is discussed in Edward Einhorn's book Paradox in Oz, where King Oz says that the Tin Woodman (then Nick Chopper) would have died were it not for his time magic. When the Tin Woodman rescues the Queen of the Field Mice by chopping off the head of a pursuing wildcat, it seems unlikely the cat's unjoined head and body continue to live independently of each other, although this goes unmentioned. Again, although the Tin Woodman survived losing all his body, prior to that, he had grown up and lost his parents in a manner inconsistent with later descriptions of Oz.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, pp. 138–9. Again, in Ozma of Oz, Jack Pumpkinhead was described as \\"a little overripe\\", and in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, he does not appear at all, although all the other characters do reappear; the implication is that he spoiled, as he feared from his creation.Riley, pp. 146–7. It is unlikely, however, since, according to the previous book, while a pumpkin which serves as Jack's head can spoil, it can be replaced, which was done several times without a problem. Both Ozma of Oz and Tik-Tok of Oz describe trees with meat growing on them, so it is possible that no animal was killed for most of the meat eaten in Oz. However, in Tin Woodman of Oz a hungry Jaguar tries to eat a live monkey, suggesting that occasionally (among non-human animals, at least) animal flesh is preferred to that of plants. Talking animals In Oz, animals such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger can talk, and all native animals appear to be capable of speech. Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West emphasized the difference between Animals and animals. Animals (capitalized) are sentient beings that can talk. Several theories exist as to how animals gained the gift of speech. The treatment of non-native animals was inconsistent. In the first book, the dog Toto never speaks, although brought to Oz; in The Patchwork Girl of Oz, Dorothy specifies that he cannot speak because he is not a fairy dog. However, in Ozma of Oz, the chicken Billina acquires speech merely by being swept to the lands near Oz, and in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, the same is true of the kitten Eureka and the cab horse Jim when reaching the land of Mangaboos, a similarly magical land. In Tik-Tok of Oz, Baum restored the continuity: Toto can speak, and always could, but never bothered to, because it was unnecessary. An additional inconsistency is introduced with Tik-Tok of Oz: Hank the Mule cannot speak until reaching the Land of Oz, although he lands on the shore of Ev first, where Billina the chicken gained the ability to speak. This might be because Tik-Tok of Oz was originally a stageplay version of Ozma of Oz; Dorothy was replaced by Betsy because he had sold the stage rights for Dorothy, and Billina was replaced by Hank because a mule could more convincingly be played by two people in a costume. Hank probably could not talk because Baum already had two speaking comedy characters, the Shaggy Man and Tik-Tok. Thus Hank would fill a better niche as a visual comedy character, in the tradition of British pantomime. The part of Hank was also an analog to the part of Dorothy's cow Imogene, Toto's replacement on stage in the immensely successful 1903 Broadway version of The Wizard of Oz, a success that Baum sought to duplicate for the rest of his life. There is one small kingdom in Oz where animals are unable to talk: Corumbia.The Yellow Knight of Oz Origin of the name Oz A legend of uncertain validity is that when relating bedtime stories (the earliest form of the Oz books) Baum was asked by his niece, Ramona Baxter Bowden, the name of the magical land. He glanced at a nearby filing cabinet, which had three drawers, labeled A–G, H–N, and O–Z. Thus he named the land Oz. This story was first told in 1903, but his wife always insisted that the part about the filing cabinet was not true.The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 103. In Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, the name is translated as \\"great and good\\". It has also been speculated that Oz was named after the abbreviation for ounce, in the theory that Oz is an allegory for the populist struggle against the illusion (the wizard) of the gold standard. Others have said that Oz stands for New York, since the letters of the alphabet before O and Z are N and Y respectively. However, this works just as well with Oz standing for Pennsylvania, because the letters following O and Z are P and A (starting again at the beginning of the alphabet). Several of Baum's fairy stories that take place in the United States were situated on the Ozark Plateau, and the similarity of name may not be a coincidence.Riley, p. 125. Oz is a common vernacular contraction of Australia (Australia—Aussie—Aus—Oz). Australia is a large continent predominated by desert regions, with pockets of intense green tropical, sub-tropical and sub-alpine greenlands and rainforests. It is quite possible that Baum took the popular nickname of Australia as the national name for his fictional world. Also note that many fans place Oz in the South Pacific, see Location above. However, according to the Oxford English dictionary, the first references to Australia by this name were made in 1902—after the first book had been published. Nevertheless, spoken references would certainly have been in use before first appearing in print (as noted by Oxford), hence possibly before the writing of the book. It is also possible that it is based on the \\"Óg\\" in Tír na nÓg. While no direct link between the mythology of Oz and the realm of Irish folklore has been conclusively proven, certain similarities, for instance Ogma and Princess Ozma, are compelling.

It had a population of 111 people at the time of the 2016 Census, and measures long by wide. The island has two pubs, a hotel, bed and breakfast, community centre, coffee shop, and a Roman Catholic church. Climate Sherkin is one of the most southerly points of Ireland after the Fastnet Rock, Cape Clear, and Brow Head. It is said that when the frost covers the lawns of Baltimore just across the bay, the grass remains unfrosted on the island. Population Sherkin once had a population of around 1,000, which started to decline during the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century. Now the population is reduced and varies between the summer and the winter months, with increases in summer as people return to holiday houses and tourists arrive. The population of Sherkin include artists, writers, craft workers, musicians, photographers,http://www.mahons.org beekeepers, cattle farmers, mussel and oyster farmers, oceanologists, fishermen, sailors, teachers, and doctors. Transport Sherkin is served year-round by a ferry service operating from the port of Baltimore. The roads on Sherkin are narrow and maintained by Cork County Council. Most of the cars on the island are old and unsuitable for use on the mainland. Given the size of the island, many residents also walk or cycle. The island also has a bus service which primarily transports people to and from the ferry. History There are a number of archaeological remains on Sherkin. A franciscan friary, known locally as the Abbey, stands above Abbey strand, where the pier is. The seat of the O'Driscoll Clan was Dún na Long. These two buildings were heavily damaged in 1537 when citizens of Waterford invaded the island after a dispute over a seized and plundered ship. Sherkin has an automated lighthouse, maintained by locals. It is situated at Barrack Point and dates from 1835.Discoverireland.ie – Sherkin The lighthouse marks the southern entrance to Baltimore Harbour, along with the Baltimore Beacon. On the south-western side of the island there is a functioning Roman Catholic church. The main historic sites include: * Promontory fort – Celtic Iron Age – 600 B.C. – 400 A.D. * Franciscan friary – Medieval – 1460 A.D.http://www.megalithicireland.com/Sherkin%20Friary,%20Cork.html * O'Driscoll Castle – Medieval – post 1200 A.D. Tourism The ferry to Sherkin sails from Baltimore on the mainland. The island is a tourist destination and it typically takes between 10 and 15 minutes to get to Sherkin from Baltimore. The journey to the neighbouring Gaeltacht island Cape Clear takes on average approximately 40 minutes. A number of Sherkin's residents are active in the fields of art, including crafts, painting and writing. The busiest season starts with school summer holidays when families visit the island. Visitors can book a sea safari trip around the islands. Once on Sherkin pier, people can visit the Franciscan friary, if it is open. Known locally as \\"the Abbey\\", it has a photo exhibition inside and some displays outside. Sherkin also has camp facilities. Because the island has no local refuse disposal facilities, campers and picnickers are encouraged to bring minimum packaging and take any litter back to the mainland or recycle cans and bottles on Sherkin Pier. Silver Strand is popular for barbecues. Festivals The busiest day of the year coincides with the Sherkin Regatta festival, a rowing regatta usually held in late July or early August. On this day the island is visited by sea rowers and their supporters, with children's activities, music and food stalls. Music festivals are also occasionally held.Fund it :: Sherkin festival with Kíla & Much More!  Development and infrastructure  The island has a local development officer, and a community-based organisation called \\"Sherkin Island Development Society\\" (SIDS). Sherkin Island is supplied with mains power from the mainland through a submarine power cable. Another submarine cable from Sherkin supplies power to Cape Clear island. Research Sherkin Island Marine Station is a privately run operation located on the north-west of the island. Founded in 1975, it is mainly involved in gathering baseline marine data, and also produces a number of reports, books and the quarterly 'Sherkin Comment' journal.

In her 2011 book Faithful Revolution: How Voice of the Faithful Is Changing the Church, Tricia Colleen Bruce, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Sociology at Maryville College in Maryville, Tennessee, looked at the development of Voice of the Faithful and its efforts to advocate for internal change while being accepted as legitimately Catholic. Drawing on three years of field observation and interviews with VOTF founders, leaders, and participants, Dr. Bruce's book explores the nature of a religious movement operating within the confines of a larger institution, an example of what the author calls an intrainstitutional social movement.Faithful Revolution: How Voice of the Faithful Is Changing the Church Oxford University Press, February 2011. Accessed March 8, 2011 In the concluding section of her book, she writes, \\"VOTF gave Catholics a space to express outrage at the scandal along with frustration and hope for the contemporary, post-Vatican II Catholic Church.\\" Demographics In 2004, two years after its founding, a study conducted by Catholic University of America found that VOTF members \\"share a deep and highly involved commitment to their Church,\\" The study also found that the majority of members were women, that a small minority had some experience of formation for priesthood or religious life, and that one third were retired. Composition of VOTF membership \\"leans heavily toward the Pre-Vatican II and Vatican II generations\\". A large percentage of VOTF members are not members of an affiliate but follow the movement on the internet. Many are active in their local parish community as serving on parish committees, as lectors, or Eucharistic ministers.

It is the southernmost inhabited part of Ireland and has a population of over 100 people. It is an official Gaeltacht area (Irish-speaking area), and most inhabitants speak Irish and English. Its nearest neighboring island is Sherkin Island, which is east of the Cape Clear Island. The island is divided into east and west halves by an isthmus called the Waist, with the North Harbour to the landward side and the South Harbour on the seaward side.David Walsh, Oileáin: A Guide to the Irish Islands (Pesda Press, 2004; ), p. 64. Ferries sail regularly from the North Harbour to Schull and Baltimore on the mainland. The South Harbour is a popular berth for yachts and pleasure boats. History Archaeological sites on the island include a prehistoric cup-marked stone (currently in the island's museum), a fulacht fiadh at Gort na Lobhar, a neolithic passage tomb at Cill Leire Forabhain, several standing stones around the island, a promontory fort at Dún an Óir, and a signal tower dating from the Napoleonic Wars. The island also has a number of early Christian sites, and is reputed to be the birthplace of Saint Ciarán of Saigir. The ruins of a 12th-century church are close to the main pier in the North Harbour. The island had a population of over 1,052 before the 19th century famine, but the current population of Cape Clear is less than one-eighth of that figure. The island's primary school was built in 1897, and was visited by President of Ireland Mary McAleese in 1998. Cape Clear was originally supplied with electricity produced by diesel generators on the island, but around 1995 these were replaced with a submarine power cable from the mainland. Culture and language The island is officially identified as a Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking) area. According to a 2007, report there were 127 people over the age of 3 living on the island, of whom 62 (48.8%) spoke Irish daily outside the education system. The population of the island increases in the summer months as students visit the local Irish Colleges, Coláiste Phobal Chléire and Coláiste Chiaráin. Students stay in local houses or dorms and improve their spoken Irish as part of the immersion courses within the Gaeltacht. Every first weekend of September, the island hosts the Cape Clear Island International Storytelling Festival. The festival has been running annually since 1994. Wildlife Seals, basking sharks and dolphins are often found in the surrounding waters, while sea pinks and honeysuckle are common plants on the land. Cape Clear is home to a lighthouse and a bird observatory. Cape Clear is popular with bird watchers and at certain times of the year is home to many species of migratory birds as its climate is milder than the mainland and thus more attractive. Bird life includes black and common guillemots, cormorants and storm petrels.

Dursey Island is 6.5 kilometres long and 1.5 kilometres wide. The island is separated from the mainland by a narrow stretch of water, Dursey Sound, which has a very strong tidal race, with the submerged Flag Rock close to the centre of the channel. The island has just six or so permanent residents, and is connected to the mainland by Ireland's only cable car. Dursey has no shops, pubs or restaurants. At one point there was a post office on the island; this has since closed. Geography and fauna The townlands on the island are Ballynacallagh, Kilmichael, and Tilickafinna. There are three main peaks, the highest 252m. The promontories and rocks off Dursey include: Bull Rock Off the western point of the island are three rocks: Bull Rock, Cow Rock and Calf Rock. On Bull Rock in a tidal race stands a lighthouse built in 1888 and automated in March 1991. This island was inhabited until this time. Calf Rock A manned lighthouse on Calf Rock was destroyed in a storm in 1881 and its remains can still be seen. Cow Rock Cow Rock is home to a number of nesting colonies of seabirds. Dolphins, whales and basking shark are sometimes seen in the sea off the island. History Prehistoric sites have been surveyed on the island, including examples of bullaun and cup-marked stones in Ballynacallagh, a prehistoric hut site at Killowen, and a radial stone enclosure at Maughanaclea. More prominent archaeological sites are visible at Ballynacallagh, where there is a ruined monastic church and graveyard, and at the site of a castle on Oileán Beag (\\"Small Island\\"). In 1602 this castle site was a garrison of the O'Sullivan Beare family. It was destroyed (along with Dunboy Castle) during the Nine Years' War. Philip O'Sullivan Beare documents that all of the occupants of the castle were killed by the English in the Dursey Massacre. The 300 islanders were killed; Donal Cam O'Sullivan Beare gathered his people from across Cork and set off to take shelter with the O'Rourkes of Leitrim. Of the 1,000 that set off, 35 survived to reach the O'Rourkes after the convoy was repeatedly attacked. Little evidence of the castle site remains. On the highest point on the island, at Tilickafinna, is a signal tower dating to the Napoleonic Wars. This narrow rectangular tower had two storeys over a basement, with each storey supported by vaulted stonework. The tower has been in ruin since the mid-19th century. During World War II a whitewashed sign saying \\"Éire\\" was built and painted close to the signal tower to indicate to pilots that they were overflying neutral Ireland. In July 1943 a Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 crashed on Crow Head near Dursey, killing all crew. Tourism The cable car and Dursey Sound, viewed from Dursey Island (Sept. 2015) The island is popular with day-trippers and walkers during the summer months. A waymarked section of the Beara Way loops around the island. Dursey Island's Beara Way walk marks the beginning of Europe's E8 European long distance path, which crosses Europe, ending in Istanbul, Turkey. Spanning Dursey Sound, the aerial tramway is Ireland's only cable car, and one of the few cable cars that cross the sea in Europe. It is one of the island's main attractions for tourists, as well as serving the local population. Dursey Sound is also one of the \\"signature discovery points\\" along the Wild Atlantic Way \\\\- a coastal touring route that stretches along Ireland's Atlantic coastline. On one road there is a 100 km/h speed limit sign – probably placed as a prank. Dursey has no shops, pubs or restaurants, but a few holiday homes are rented on the island.

Designed by Italian Giovanni Battista Cairati, it was built between 1593 and 1596, by order of King Philip I of Portugal, to guard the Old Port of Mombasa. Fort Jesus was the only fort maintained by the Portuguese on the Swahili coast, and is recognised as a testament to the first successful attempt by a Western power to establish influence over the Indian Ocean trade. Cairato, the designer of the fort, was inspired by Italian architect Pietro Cataneo, while the master builder was Gaspar Rodrigues. The fort was Cairato's last overseas work. Although the design of Fort Jesus is an example of Renaissance architecture, the masonry techniques, building materials and labour are believed to have been provided by the local Swahili people. The fort was built in the shape of a man (viewed from the air) and is roughly square, with four bulwarks at its corners. The fort is considered a masterpiece of late Renaissance military fortification. Fort Jesus was captured and recaptured at least nine times between 1631, when the Portuguese lost it to the Sultan Yusuf ibn al-Hasan of Mombasa, and 1895 when it fell under British rule and was converted into a prison. After the Portuguese recaptured it from the Sultan in 1632, they refurbished it and built more fortifications, subsequently making it harder for the fort to fall. The fort was subject to an epic two-year siege from 1696-98 by the Omani Arabs, led by Saif bin Sultan. The capture of the fort marked the end of Portuguese presence on the coast, although they briefly captured and re- occupied it between 1728 and 1729 with the help of the Swahili city-states. The fort fell under local rule from 1741 to 1837, when it was again captured by the Omanis and used as a barracks, before its occupation by the British in 1895, after the declaration of the Protectorate of Kenya. Fort Jesus was declared a national park in 1958, and in 2011, it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and highlighted as one of the most outstanding and well-preserved examples of 16th-century Portuguese military fortifications. The fort is Mombasa's most visited tourist attraction. Overview Between 1631 and 1875, the fort was won and lost nine times by the nations contesting control of Kenya. The Omanis took the fort in 1698 after a notable siege of almost three years. It was declared a historical monument in 1958. Today it houses a museum. The fort was designed by a Milanese architect, :pt:Giovanni Battista Cairati, who was the Chief Architect for Portuguese possessions in the East. It was the first European-style fort constructed outside of Europe designed to resist cannon fire.Gilbert, Erik, and Jonathan T. Reynolds. Africa in World History: From Prehistory to Present. New Jersey: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 225 Today, it is one of the finest examples of 16th-century Portuguese military architecture, which has been influenced and changed by both the Omani Arabs and the British.Kirkman, J. 1974. Fort Jesus: A Portuguese Fortress on the East African Coast Clarendon Press: Oxford The fort quickly became a vital possession for anyone with the intention of controlling Mombasa Island or the surrounding areas of trade. When the British colonized Kenya, they used it as a prison, until 1958, when they converted it into a historical monument. James Kirkman was then assigned to excavate the monument, which he did (with a large use of external historical documents) from 1958 to 1971. The architecture of the fort represents the rough outline of a person lying on their back, with the head towards the sea. The height of the walls is 18 meters. The original Portuguese fort had a height of 15 meters, but the Oman Arabs added 3 meters upon capturing the fort. The fort combines Portuguese, Arab, and British elements (these being the major powers that held it at different times in history). The Portuguese and British presence is preserved in the presence of their respective cannons. The Portuguese cannons had a range of 200 meters and are longer than the British cannons which had a range of 300 meters. Oman Arabs marked their occupancy with numerous inscriptions from the Koran on the wooden door posts and ceiling beams. The Muslim tradition of five pillars is also portrayed throughout the fort, with a former meeting hall supported by five stone pillars to the ceiling. Some of the historical structures still standing in the fort include Oman House, which was the house for Sultan who governed the East African coast. Others are an open water cistern by the Portuguese for harvesting rain water, and a 76-foot deep well sunk by the Arabs (but its water was too salty to be used for anything but washing). The fort was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2011. Fort Jesus today Fort Jesus is now a popular destination for foreign and local tourists. As well as a tourist destination, the Fort is important as a host for numerous research programs, a Conservation Lab, an Education Department, and an Old Town Conservation Office.

Bank of the West is a regional financial services company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It is a subsidiary of BNP Paribas. It has more than 600 branches and offices in the Midwest and Western United States. History Bank of the West began as Farmers National Gold Bank of San Jose, California, in 1874. When all bank notes became convertible to gold or silver in 1880, the bank converted from a gold national bank and changed its name to the First National Bank of San Jose, California. In 1970, Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) established the French Bank of California. Later that decade, First National Bank of San Jose changed its name to Bank of the West. In 1979, BNP bought Bank of the West and merged in the French Bank of California. The bank owned 35 locations and $350 million in assets. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Bank of the West bought several other banks and branches. In 1987, Bank of the West bought Bank of Los Gatos.Bank of Los Gatos had been founded in 1883. When Bank of the West bought it in 1987, it had failed. This was followed by the 1990 purchase of Central Banking Systems; the 1991 purchase of 30 branches in northern California from failed Imperial Savings and Loan; the 1992 purchase of Atlantic Financial Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation; the 1993 purchase of 15 branches in northern California from Citibank for $360 million; the 1995 purchase of NorthBay Savings Bank, headquartered in Petaluma, California; and the 1997 purchase of branches from Bank of America and Coast Federal Bank. In 1995, First Hawaiian Bank established Pacific One Bank to hold 30 branches in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho that it acquired from West One Bank when that bank was acquired by U.S. Bancorp and had to divest certain assets, due to the number of preexisting branches of U.S. Bank in the region. Three years later, in 1998, BNP and First Hawaiian Inc., the parent of First Hawaiian Bank and Pacific One Bank, created a company under the BancWest Bancorp name to hold Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank, with Bank of the West absorbing Pacific One. The creation of BancWest Bancorp caused the now-called BNP Paribas's (BNPP) ownership of the holding company to fall to 45%. BNPP also agreed not to increase its ownership of the bank holding company before November 2001. Bank of the West footprint In 1999, Bank of the West bought Sierra West Bancorp. This transaction temporarily diluted BNP's ownership of the holding company to 42%. In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas. In 2001, as part of the regulatory approval process with Wells Fargo Banks's acquisition of First Security Corp., Bank of the West acquired 23 First Security branches in New Mexico and seven First Security branches in Nevada to avoid antitrust issues with overlapping Wells Fargo operations. Also in 2001, First Hawaiian Bank bought Union Bank of California's branches in Guam and Saipan. First Hawaiian had established its first branch in Guam in 1970 and its first branch in Saipan in 1997. (Union Bank of California had established its branch in Guam in 1974.) In May 2001, the independent directors of BancWest Bancorp established a special committee that then unanimously voted to accept BNP's offer to acquire the remaining 55% of BancWest Bancorp, making the holding company a wholly owned subsidiary of BNP. The year 2001 concluded with the December purchase by Bank of the West of United California Bank from Japan's UFJ Bank. A Bank of the West branch in Gillette, Wyoming A Bank of the West branch in Lewisville, Texas In March 2004, Bank of the West announced the purchase of Community First Bankshares, a bank holding company that operated Community First National Bank, headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota, which had 155 offices in 12 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Soon after, Bank of the West agreed to buy USDB Bancorp, the parent of Union Safe Deposit Bank. In December 2005, Bank of the West bought Commercial Federal Corporation of Omaha, Nebraska. This merger added offices in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma to Bank of the West. In January 2006, Bank of the West opened a representative office in Tokyo, Japan, and in September 2007, it opened a representative office in Taipei, Taiwan.

He was originally performed by Jim Henson and Frank Oz simultaneously, with Henson performing the head and voice and Oz performing the character's live hands. The Swedish Chef is currently performed by Bill Barretta. His best known phrase is \\"Börk börk börk\\". Character A parody of television chefs, the Swedish Chef wears a toque blanche, has a thick brown moustache and has bushy eyebrows that completely obscure his eyes. He was one of the few Muppets to employ an actual puppeteer's visible hands, which extended from the ends of his sleeves and facilitated handling food and utensils. Oz originally provided the character's hands. The character bears no resemblance to Sweden, Swedes or the Swedish language. Nearly all Swedish Chef sketches on The Muppet Show feature him in a kitchen, waving some utensils while singing an introductory song in a mock language – a semi-comprehensible gibberish supposedly mimicking Swedish phonology and prosody. The song's lyrics vary slightly from one episode to the next, but always end with \\"Bork, bork, bork!\\" as the Chef throws the utensils aside, occasionally knocking items off a shelf or the back wall in the process. After this introduction, the Chef begins to prepare a recipe while giving a gibberish explanation of what he is doing. His commentary is spiced with the occasional English word to clue in the viewer to what he is attempting. These hints are necessary as he frequently uses unorthodox culinary equipment (firearms, sports equipment, hand tools, etc.) to prepare his dishes. (E.g. \\"See de moofin? Und here de boom-a-shootin\\" before tossing an English muffin into the air and firing a blunderbuss at it to make a doughnut.) The sketch typically degenerates into a slapstick finale where the equipment or ingredients (often a live animal he is attempting to cook) get the better of him. In the sketch 'Bomb Egg' (episode 212), a mis- aimed explosive charge slightly damaged the face of the puppet. The Chef's face remained scarred through the rest of the season. The Chef is referred to by name in one episode, in which Danny Kaye plays his uncle. Kaye reels off a very long name but adds, \\"But we call him Tom\\" – much to the Chef's amusement. In 2010, the Chef was seen wearing a wedding ring, implying that the character is married. Inspiration Some claim that the Swedish Chef was inspired by a real-life chef. One example is Friedman Paul Erhardt, a German American television chef known as \\"Chef Tell\\". Another example is Lars \\"Kuprik\\" Bäckman, a real-life Swedish chef. Bäckman claims that his rather unsuccessful appearance on an early edition of Good Morning America caught the attention of Jim Henson, who later bought the rights to the recording and created Bäckman's Muppet alter ego. Bäckman's Dalecarlian accent would explain the chef's strange pronunciation. Muppet writer Jerry Juhl denied Bäckman's story and insisted the character had no real-world counterpart: \\"I wrote, rehearsed, rewrote, brainstormed, and giggled uncontrollably a thousand times with Jim Henson as we dealt with the Swedish Chef, and I never once heard him mention an actual Swedish chef...\\" According to Brian Henson, in one of his introductions for The Muppet Show, \\"[Jim Henson] had this tape that he used to play which was 'How to Speak Mock Swedish'. And he used to drive to work and I used to ride with him a lot. And he would drive to work trying to make a chicken sandwich in Mock Swedish or make a turkey casserole in Mock Swedish. It was the most ridiculous thing you had ever seen. And people at traffic lights used to stop and sort of look at him a little crazy. But that was the roots of the character that would eventually become the Swedish Chef.\\" When interviewed on the subject in Swedish magazine Expressen in 1985, Jim Henson claimed that \\"one of my writers came up with the idea that the chef should sound like the Swedish actors in Ingmar Bergman films\\". International The Swedish Chef is called Svenske kocken (Swedish cook) in Sweden. A 2012 article stated that \\"the fact that his nonsense words are so widely interpreted as Swedish-sounding is bewildering and annoying to Swedes\\" and that Swedes don't find the character funny at all; the author quoted his wife who said the character \\"doesn't sound Swedish, doesn’t act Swedish, and there’s nothing Swedish about him. He’s not funny.\\" In the German-dubbed version of The Muppet Show, the Chef is not a Swede, but a Dane. Appearances Besides appearances in The Muppet Show, the chef also appears in The Muppet Movie (1979), The Great Muppet Caper (1981), The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984), The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years (1986), A Muppet Family Christmas (1987), Muppet*Vision 3D (1991), an attraction found at Disney's Hollywood Studios, The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), Muppet Treasure Island (1996), Muppets From Space (1999), It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie (2002), Studio DC: Almost Live (2008), a sketch for the cast of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and an episode with Hannah Montana star Jason Earles and Cory in the House star Jason Dolley, the Muppet viral video \\"Popcorn\\" (2010), The Muppets (2011), Muppets Most Wanted (2014), a regular role on The Muppets (2015), and also appearing as a guest alongside Miss Piggy on the 5th season of MasterChef Junior (2017). A younger version of the Swedish Chef appeared on the Disney Junior series Muppet Babies where he was referred to simply as Chef. The Swedish Chef has also appeared in a 2013 \\"This is SportsCenter\\" commercial with Robert Flores, Henrik Lundqvist, Steve Levy, and Linda Cohn. He appears in Muppets Now on the segment “Okey Dokey Kookin” in which he competes against celebrity chefs.

Powers Telempath is a science fiction novel by Spider Robinson set in a dystopian near-future in which human cities have fallen into ruin and the population has been sharply reduced. The novel, Robinson's first, is an expansion of his 1977 Hugo Award-winning novella By Any Other Name. It was first published under the Berkley imprint of G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1976. Plot summary The novel's protagonist, Isham Stone, is on a mission to kill the man allegedly responsible for the destruction of civilization: a scientist named Wendell Carlson, currently living alone at the former Columbia University in what used to be New York City. Isham has been told by his father, scientist Jacob Stone, that Carlson is a madman who brought the world to its current state by releasing a \\"hyperosmic plague\\": a virus that increases the sensitivity of the human sense of smell by many hundred times. With their senses of smell thus heightened, humans were unable to tolerate the odors produced by their own pollution-producing technology; the result was mass insanity and widespread rioting. Another result was the discovery of a species of \\"Muskys\\"  intelligent plasmoids  that live in the Earth's upper atmosphere and feed on human pollutants. The curtailment of technological activity has caused them to approach the planet's surface and attack human beings, on whose fear they are apparently able to feed. Isham sets out for New York and succeeds in locating Carlson. He learns from Carlson, however, that the man actually responsible for developing and releasing the plague is Isham's father Jacob. Isham returns to his home colony and sets a trap to kill his father, then returns to New York. The original novella By Any Other Name ends at this point. The novel continues as Isham's old teacher, Collaci, sets out to bring him back from New York to face a murder charge. Isham is successfully captured, but before he can be tried, his colony is attacked by Agros (anti-technology worshippers of Pan) and he is taken prisoner. Eventually Isham manages to bring about a measure of peace between the scientists and the neo-Luddites  and also learns that his father is not dead. The newly reconciled factions of humanity set out to rebuild civilization. Release details *1976, USA, Berkley (), hardback (First edition.

Bonnke had been an evangelist and missionary in Africa since 1967.  Early life  Reinhard Bonnke was born on 19 April 1940, in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany, the son of an army logistics officer. With his mother and siblings, he was taken to Denmark during the evacuation of East Prussia and spent some years in a displaced persons centre.Watt, C. Reinhard Bonnke: A Passion for the Gospel 1978 pp19-27 He became a born-again Christian at the age of nine after his mother spoke with him about a sin that he had committed. He sensed a call from God to serve as a missionary in Africa from the age of 10 and said that he had the experience of baptism in the Holy Spirit. After war service, his father had become a pastor. Bonnke studied at the Bible College of Wales in Swansea, Wales, where he was inspired by the director, Samuel Rees Howells. In one meeting after Howells spoke of answered prayer, Bonnke prayed, \\"Lord, I also want to be a man of faith. I want to see your way of providing for needs.\\" Passing through London, he had a chance meeting with the famous preacher George Jeffreys, who encouraged the young German student.Watt, C. Reinhard Bonnke: A Passion for the Gospel, 1978, pp. 66-67 After graduation, he pastored in Germany for seven years. His African ministry, which he was principally known for, began in 1967 in Lesotho. He subsequently held evangelical meetings across the continent. Over the 79 years of his life, it is estimated that over 79 million people - a million for each year of his life - came to Christ as a result of Bonnke's ministry. Shellnut, Kate.Christianity Today. \\"Reinhard Bonnke, record setting Evangelist to Africa\\" Retrieved 2 May 2020. He has been called a \\"giant and a general in the Army of God\\". Reinhard Bonnke died 7 December 2019 at age 79.  Death  Bonnke died on 7 December 2019, surrounded by his family according to a statement signed by his wife. Bonnke had announced on his official Facebook page in November 2019 that he had undergone femur surgery and needed time to \\"learn how to walk again\\". Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who is Muslim, praised Bonnke's for his frequent visits to Nigeria and described Bonnke's death as a \\"great loss to Nigeria\\". African mission Early on, Bonnke encountered poor results from his evangelistic efforts and felt frustrated at the pace of his ministry. Bonnke claims to have had a recurring dream featuring a picture of the map of Africa being spread with red and heard the voice of God crying \\"Africa Shall Be Saved\\". This led him to adopt large-scale evangelism, rather than the traditional small scale missionary approach. He rented a stadium in Gaborone, Botswana and preached with little cooperation from local churches. Beginning with only 100 people, the stadium meetings grew. In 1974, Bonnke founded the mission organisation Christ For All Nations (abbreviated CfaN). Originally based in Johannesburg, South Africa, the headquarters were relocated to Frankfurt, Germany, in 1986. This was done primarily to distance the organisation from South Africa's apartheid policy at the time. Today CfaN has 9 offices across 5 continents. Bonnke began his ministry holding tent meetings that accommodated large crowds. According to an account published by the Christian Broadcasting Network, in 1984 he commissioned the construction of what was claimed to be the world's largest mobile structure – a tent capable of seating 34,000; this was destroyed in a wind storm just before a major meeting and therefore the team decided to hold the event in the open air instead. According to this account, the event was subsequently attended by over 100,000 people which is far greater than the 34,000 seating capacity the tents could contain. In addition to South Africa, Bonnke would also hold numerous crusades in other African countries such as Nigeria and Kenya and also became known as \\"the Billy Graham of Africa.\\" In the February 5, 2001 edition of Graham's Christianity Today, journalist Corrie Cutrer stated that Bonnke had set \\"record breaking attendances\\" at recent crusades he held in Nigeria. Bonnke announced his \\"farewell gospel crusade\\" to be held in Lagos, Nigeria, in November 2017. Lagos is also the location of a gospel crusade held in 2000 which, according to CfaN, is the organisation's largest to-date, drawing an attendance of six million people. In 2019 Reinhard Bonnke was set to headline the G12 Africa Conference in Pretoria, South Africa.  Controversy In 1991, during Bonnke's visit to Kano in Nigeria, there were riots in the city as Muslims protested over remarks he had reportedly made about Islam in the city of Kaduna on his way to Kano. A rumor was spread that Bonnke was planning to \\"lead an invasion\\" into Kano. Muslim youths gathered at the Kofar Mata Eide-ground where they were addressed by several clerics who claimed that Bonnke was going to blaspheme Islam. About 8,000 youths gathered at the Emir's palace and after noon prayers the riots ensued, during which many Christians sustained various injuries and several churches were burned. After nine years, he returned to Nigeria to preach.  Personal life  After graduating from the Bible College of Wales and returning to Germany, Bonnke led a series of meetings in Rendsburg. He began receiving speaking invitations from all around Germany and the rest of the world. Bonnke met Anni Suelze at a gospel music festival, and admired the grace with which she recovered from a wrongly pitched music performance at the expense of losing the competition. He offered to preach at the church she attended one Sunday and fell in love with her. They married in 1964 and had three children.  Autobiography  Bonnke's autobiography, Living a Life of Fire, is a collection of stories of his life, including accounts of his childhood growing up during the Second World War and living in prison camps to his early years in ministry and how he believed God used him to bring the gospel of salvation to Africa.

While parasitic gaps are present in English and some related Germanic languages, e.g. Swedish (see Engdahl 1983), their appearance is much more restricted in other, closely related languages, e.g. German and the Romance languages.Parasitic gaps have been studied most using English and Swedish data. See Engdahl's seminal article (1983) in this regard. Japanese linguistic scholar Fumikazu Niinuma has attempted to differentiate between parasitic gaps and coordination in his research, as he believes the two are often confused. An aspect of parasitic gaps that makes them particularly mysterious is the fact they usually appear inside islands to extraction. Although the study of parasitic gaps began in the late 1970s, no consensus has yet been reached about the best analysis.See the introduction in Culicover's and Postal's collection of papers (2001) for an overview of the varying theoretical accounts of parasitic gaps. The phenomenon The following b-sentences illustrate typical parasitic gaps. The parasitic gaps are marked with a p-subscript: ::a. You reviewed that book without actually reading it. – No gap at all present ::b. What book did you review __ without actually reading __p? – Parasitic gap possible ::c. *You reviewed that book without actually reading __p. – Parasitic gap impossible without \\"real\\" gap ::a. They played that song repeatedly despite not liking it. – No gap at all present ::b. Which song did they play __ repeatedly despite not liking __p? – Parasitic gap possible ::c. *They played that song repeatedly despite not liking __p. – Parasitic gap impossible without \\"real\\" gap ::a. You bought that old bike in order to fix it up. – No gap at all present ::b. Which old bike did you buy __ in order to fix __p up? – Parasitic gap possible ::c. *You bought that old bike in order to fix __p up. – Parasitic gap impossible without \\"real\\" gap The a-sentences are normal declarative sentences that contain no gaps at all. Each b-sentence, in contrast, contains two gaps, whereby the second gap is parasitic on the first. The c-sentences illustrate that if there is no \\"real\\" gap (that corresponds to the wh-expression in bold), the parasitic gap is not possible. One interesting thing about parasitic gaps like the ones here in the b-sentences is their motivation. Their appearance appears to be reliant on syntactic movement (e.g. wh-movement or topicalization). The fact, however, that there are two gaps in each b-sentence but only one fronted wh-expression is a source of the difficulty associated with the construction. How does it come to pass that one fronted wh-expression is capable of licensing two gaps? Another interesting fact about parasitic gaps is that they usually appear inside extraction islands (as they do in the examples just given), hence one might expect extraction from the site of parasitic gaps to be altogether impossible. The fact that the islands are ignored is a second source of challenge associated with the phenomenon. Some historical notes The phenomenon of parasitic gaps appears to have been discovered by John Robert Ross in the 1960s,See Ross' seminal dissertation (1967/86) in this regard. but remained undiscussed until papers by Knut Tarald Taraldsen and Elisabet Engdahl explored the properties of the phenomenon in detail.See especially Engdahl's 1983 article in this regard – more than any other paper, this one got the ball rolling. The knowledge of parasitic gaps was central to the development of the GPSG framework (Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar) in the mid 1980s, this knowledge then being refined later in the HPSG framework (Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar) of Carl Pollard and Ivan Sag. In the 90s, a debate centered around the best theoretical analysis of parasitic gaps (extraction vs. percolation), this debate culminating in a collection of essays edited by Peter Culicover and Paul Postal in 2001.In addition to the essays, Culicover's and Postal's book also contains an extensive overview of earlier accounts of the phenomenon. Some traits of parasitic gaps The following subsections briefly explore some aspects of parasitic gaps that have been widely acknowledged in the literature on parasitism. The following areas are addressed: #many parasitic gaps appear optionally; #some parasitic gaps appear obligatorily; #parasitic gaps appear in missing object constructions; and #syntactic parallelism seems to promote the appearance of parasitic gaps. Optional parasitic gaps Many parasitic gaps appear optionally. They are in non-complementary distribution with a pronoun, meaning that the speaker has the choice whether to employ the gap or not, e.g. ::a. Which dish did you order __ after you tried __p? – Parasitic gap present ::b. Which dish did you order __ after you tried it? – Parasitic gap absent ::a. Which movie will they like __ as soon as they see __p? – Parasitic gap present ::b. Which movie will they like __ as soon as they see it? – Parasitic gap absent The a-sentence contain typical parasitic gaps, whereas the b-sentence choose to use a pronoun instead of the gap. In other words, the parasitic gap in the a-sentences is occurring optionally. Optionality like this suggests an analysis of parasitism in terms of ellipsis, since optionality is the primary trait of known ellipsis mechanisms. Obligatory parasitic gaps While many parasitic gaps occur optionally as just illustrated, other parasitic gaps occur obligatorily. This can be the case when the parasitic gap precedes the \\"real\\" gap, e.g. ::a. The rumor about the girl annoyed her. – No gap at all present ::b. Which girl did [the rumor about __p] annoy __? – Parasitic gap precedes \\"real\\" gap ::c. ??Which girl did the rumor about her annoy __? – Real gap hardly possible unless the parasitic gap is present; weak crossover has occurred ::a. If you get to know him, you will like Bill. – No gap at all present ::b. Bill is the type of guy who [if you get to know __p], you will like __. – Parasitic gap precedes \\"real\\" gap ::c. ??Bill is the type of guy who if you get to know him, you will like __. – Real gap hardly possible unless the parasitic gap is present; weak crossover has occurred These examples illustrate a couple of important facts about parasitic gaps. The b-sentences demonstrate that the parasitic gap can indeed precede the \\"real\\" gap, and the strong marginality of the c-sentences shows that in a sense, the real gap can also be dependent on the parasitic gap. Note that we know that the first gap (the leftmost gap) in the b-sentences is parasitic on the following gap because it, i.e. the leftmost gap, appears inside what is normally an extraction island (marked with square brackets). The aspect of parasitic gaps illustrated with these examples is addressed in terms of the weak crossover phenomenon (WCO).Concerning the importance of weak crossover to the theory of parasitic gaps, see for instance Engdahl (1983:17ff.), Culicover (2001:32f.), and Levine and Hukari 2001:194). The WCO phenomenon occurs when a fronted expression is coreferential with an intermediate expression that appears between the fronted expression and the position of its gap. In the big picture, one can simply note that parasitic gaps behave variable depending upon whether they precede or follow the \\"real\\" gap. When they precede the \\"real\\" gap, their appearance is usually obligatory. Missing object constructions Much work on parasitism assumes that parasitic gaps are dependent on another gap, the \\"real\\" gap in the examples above. Hence the assumption is that parasitic gaps are reliant on those mechanisms that license normal extraction gaps, e.g. wh- movement and topicalization. This assumption is challenged, however, by so- called missing-object constructions (also known as tough-constructions),The ability of missing-object constructions to license parasitic gaps is widely acknowledged, e.g. Engdahl (1983:12f.), Postal (2001:257), Culicover (2001:34). e.g. ::a. It is easy to appreciate her after getting to know her. – No gap present ::b. She is easy to appreciate __ after getting to know __p. – Parasitic gap present despite the lack of wh-fronting and topicalization ::a. It is hard to understand this essay without reading it several times. – No gap present ::b. This essay is hard to understand __ without reading __p several times. – Parasitic gap present despite the lack of wh-fronting and topicalization ::a. It will be tough to get the motor running without entirely rebuilding it. – No gap present ::b. The motor will be tough to get __ running without entirely rebuilding __p. – Parasitic gap present despite the lack of wh-fronting and topicalization The a-sentences lack gaps entirely. The b-sentences contain parasitic gaps despite the fact that neither wh-movement nor topicalization has occurred. The b-sentences illustrate missing-object constructions, since the verbs appreciate, understand, and get are transitive and should hence take an object. This object is missing, as marked by the gap on the left. Whatever the analysis of parasitic gaps ends up being in the long run, it will have to accommodate the facts involving missing objects illustrated here. Movement (wh-movement, topicalization) may actually not be the key factor licensing parasitic gaps. The role of parallelism Examining the examples of optional parasitic gaps produced above so far, one sees that in each case, a certain parallelism is present.The role played by syntactic parallelism in determining the distribution of parasitic gaps has been explored by many, e.g. Williams (1990), Munn (2001), Culicover (2013:153ff.). This parallelism is now illustrated using brackets: ::a. Which manuscript did you [resubmit __] after [revising __p]? ::b. Which foods does he [fantasize about __] without [ever eating __p]? ::c. Which report did you [file __] without [reading __p]? ::d. Which old bike did he [buy __] in order to [fix __p up]? ::e. Which girl did you [ask __ out] before [meeting __p in person]? In each of these examples, the square brackets mark what appear to be parallel structures, as associated with the coordinate structures of coordination. The brackets mark verb phrases (VPs), whereby the subordinator appearing between the brackets is functioning like a coordinator (i.e. and, or, or but). This parallelism may be a significant factor that is aiding the appearance of the parasitic gaps. When this parallelism is absent, there is a significant drop in acceptability of the parasitic gap: ::a. ?Who [ __ secretly supports John] without [John secretly supporting __p back]? ::b. ?Which girl [ __ likes Billy] without [Billy liking __p back]? ::c. ?Which spy [ __ escaped] without [anyone first identifying __p]? ::d. ??Which explanation [ __ had to be repeated] for [us to finally get __p]? ::e. ??Which report [ __ was filed] without [any of us first reading ___p]? These instances of parasitic gaps are all marginal to varying degrees. The marginality is probably due to the lack of syntactic parallelism indicated by the brackets, the gaps no longer appearing on the same side of the brackets. In any case, there is a noticeable drop in acceptability when the parallelism in the examples further above is removed. What exactly explains this drop in acceptability is not entirely clear, although it may have to do with ease of processing. Parallel structures are easier for humans to process, and hence parasitic gaps are reliant on a low processing load. Theoretical controversy The theoretical analysis of parasitic gaps is not a settled matter by any means, since accounts of the phenomenon vary drastically. In very broad terms, there are two lines of analysis that one can pursue. The first is to assume that parasitic gaps are extraction gaps (the extraction analysis);For two examples of the extraction analysis of parasitic gaps, see Contreras (1984) and Chomsky (1986). parasitic gaps arise by way of the same basic mechanism that licenses \\"normal\\" extraction gaps. This sort of approach must augment the analysis of extraction gaps in some way in order to accommodate parasitic gaps under the same theoretical umbrella. The alternative approach rejects the analysis that takes parasitic gaps to be extraction gaps. One assumes instead that parasitic gaps actually contain a covert element, this element having the status of definite proform. (the proform analysis).For examples of the proform analysis, see Cinque 1990, Fiengo and May 1994, Postal 1994). Some analyses mix and match these two basic lines of analysis, although in general, both are well represented in the literature on parasitism and most accounts can be placed in the one or the other camp. Extraction analyses have the advantage that they immediately accommodate the simple observation that most parasitic gaps appear to be dependent on the occurrence of wh-movement or topicalization. Extraction analyses are challenged, however, by missing-object constructions, as noted above. Proform analyses have the advantage that they immediately accommodate the simple observation that many parasitic gaps occur optionally; the covert proform has the option to be overt. The proform analyses are challenged, however, by the fact that most parasitic gaps occur in the immediate environment of wh-movement or topicalization, since they do not provide a clear basis for explaining this correlation.
