He wrote a Handbook of Industrial Chemistry in 1872. He is remembered for his early work in indigo. Biography Engler was the son of a pastor, and he studied Chemistry from 1859 at the Karlsruhe Polytechnic where he became a scientific assistant in 1863. In 1864 he became a Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Freiburg, and he taught there as a private lecturer from 1867 until 1872. In 1872 Engler became extraordinary professor of chemistry at the University of Halle where he published his Handbuch der technischen Chemie (\\"Handbook of Industrial Chemistry\\") between 1872 and 1874 (co-author, Leipzig professor Friedrich Stohmann). The two- volume edition was based on Anselme Payen's Pr√©cis de chimie industrielle.Handbuch der technischen Chemie OCLC World Cat In 1876 he became a tenured professor of chemical technology and headmaster of the chemical technical Laboratory at the polytechnic school in Karlsruhe (from 1885 the Technical University Karlsruhe). In 1887 he became a professor of chemistry and director of the Technical University Karlsruhe. In 1870 he and Adolph Emmerling, a student of Adolf von Baeyer, published a work in which the two first reported the formation of traces of indigo in a material not derived from indigo. Therefore, they have not found indigo ‚Äúsynthesis‚Äù, as often reported. Adolf von Baeyer succeeded in this in 1878, who also described in 1883 the correct structural formula. From 1884 he turned to the petrochemistry. He took a study trip in 1885 to the production area in the Caucasus, travelling later to the Middle East (Egypt) and to North America. Engler argued that oil originated in ancient times from animal fat. His later research focused on petroleum. To determine the viscosity, he developed the Engler viscometer. Together with Hans H√∂fer he published in 1919 the six- volume work \\"Das Erd√∂l ‚Äì Seine Physik, Chemie, Geologie, Technologie und sein Wirtschaftsbetrieb‚Äú in two editions from 1927.http://www.deutsche- biographie.de/xsfz13375.html Besides his researches in petroleum he also studied the properties of ozone and from 1903 he was a member in the Board of BASF, where he was involved in the development of the Haber process. =Politics= Engler was politically active in the National Liberal Party.

Born in Hartlepool, County Durham, he attained notoriety in 1984 when he was convicted of three murders committed in Dore, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, on 23 October 1983. He has remained in prison ever since, and since 2008 has made a number of legal challenges to overturn an order by the Home Office that his life sentence means life and that he should never be released. Crimes Hutchinson had already spent more than five years in prison for the attempted murder of his half brother, Deano. On the morning of 28 September 1983 Hutchinson arrived at Selby Police Station after being arrested on suspicion of theft, burglary and rape. He asked to go to the toilet, and whilst there, he jumped out of a window in an attempt to escape and cut his knee on barbed wire. After three and a half weeks on the run, late on the night of 23 October 1983, Hutchinson broke into the home of Basil Laitner, 59, his 55-year-old wife Avril, and their 28-year-old son Richard via a patio window, and stabbed all three of them to death. He then raped their 18-year- old daughter Nicola at knife-point before fleeing. Just hours earlier, the family had hosted the wedding reception of their other daughter Suzanne at the house. It is believed that Hutchinson was planning to commit an armed robbery. His identity was established by the description given by Nicola Laitner, and by a palm-print left on a champagne glass. After spending another two weeks on the run, wearing disguises and moving from place to place in Barnsley, Nottinghamshire, Manchester, York, and Scarborough, he was finally caught on a farm in Hartlepool on 5 November 1983. During his trial, on 11 September 1984, Hutchinson accused Mike Barron, then a reporter with the Sunday Mirror, of committing the murders. Hutchinson was found guilty of all three murders and the rape on 14 September 1984 after a four-hour deliberation, and sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 18 years, which could have seen him released from prison in 2002 in the event of the Parole Board deciding that he was no longer a risk. After the conviction, the then Home Secretary, Leon Brittan, placed Hutchinson on the list of prisoners whose life sentences mean life, meaning that it is unlikely he will ever be released. =Appeals against sentence= Hutchinson later appealed against the Home Secretary's ruling. His case was heard on 16 May 2008 at the High Court, nearly six years after the final say on minimum terms for life sentence prisoners was transferred from the Home Secretary to the High Court. His solicitors argued that a whole life tariff was a breach of his human rights. However, his appeal was rejected and the High Court agreed with the Home Secretary's ruling that life means life for Hutchinson. Hutchinson lodged a second appeal against his sentence shortly afterwards, his case returning to the High Court on 6 October 2008, but again was rejected. On 13 July 2013, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the whole life tariff was a breach of human rights. However, on 3 February 2015, Hutchinson lost an appeal in the European Court of Human Rights against his sentence, with the court's judges ruling that whole life tariffs were appropriate in certain cases, just as the High Court of England and Wales had 12 months earlier, on the condition that such sentences were reviewed within 25 years of the offender being sentenced. Within four months, however, it was reported that he was returning to the European Court of Human Rights for a fresh challenge against his sentence. = Referral to Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights = On 1 June 2015, Hutchinson's case was referred to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights. The referral was made at the request of Hutchinson and his case was heard by the Grand Chamber on 21 October 2015. On 17 January 2017, the Court ruled against Hutchinson, holding that the UK had the right to impose whole-life tariffs in appropriate circumstances.

L√©ger was born at Les Cayes, Haiti, in 1859. He received his early education in Haiti, and as a very young man went to Paris, where he continued his higher studies and also received his legal training. His father had been a member of the Haitian senate and a statesman of note, so that young L√©ger began to take an active part in the politics of his country at an early age. In 1881, when only 22 years old, he was made secretary of the Haitian legation in Paris, and a little later, upon the abrupt resignation of Minister Charles S√©guy Villevaleix, the young secretary was made charge d'affaires. Upon his return to Haiti, he resumed the practice of law at Port-au-Prince, and also became editor-in-chief of an influential political journal. In 1890 he was made chief of a division in the department of foreign affairs, and in 1892 became one of the founders of the Soci√©t√© de L√©gislation of Port-au-Prince, later becoming its president. He was also made president of the Order of Barristers of Port-au-Prince and was subsequently made a member of the permanent court of arbitration at The Hague. Having been elected as a member of the Chamber of Deputies of Haiti, L√©ger took high rank in that legislative body, serving as chairman of the committee of foreign affairs and as a member of the judiciary committee. In 1896 he was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Haiti at Washington, a post he held for nearly 13 years. While serving in this post, he was appointed as the delegate from Haiti to the Second Pan American Congress, and thereafter made vice chairman of the committee on regulations for the Third International Conference. As a member of the governing board of the Pan American Union he served on many important committees. In 1911 he was appointed Foreign Minister of his country, a post he held until May 1913, and to which he was recalled by President Oreste Zamor in 1914. Upon his retirement from public office L√©ger resumed his legal and literary work, for which he gained renown that extended far beyond Haiti.

Sometimes called a universal protocol gateway, this class of product is designed as a computer appliance, and is used to connect data from one automation system to another.  Typical applications  Typical applications include: M2M Communications ‚Äì machine to machine communications between machines from different vendors, typically using different communication protocols. This is often a requirement to optimize the performance of a production line, by effectively communicating machine states upstream and downstream of a piece of equipment. Machine idle times can trigger lower power operation. Inventory Levels can be more effectively managed on a per station basis, by knowing the upstream and downstream demands. M2E Communications ‚Äì machine to enterprise communications is typically managed through database interactions. In this case, EATM technology is typically leveraged for data interoperability. However, many enterprise systems have real-time data interfaces. When real-time interfaces are involved, a universal gateway, with its ability to support many protocols simultaneously becomes the best choice. In all cases, communications can fall over many different transports, RS-232, RS-485, Ethernet, etc. Universal Gateways have the ability to communicate between protocols and over different transports simultaneously.

It offers assistance to those affected directly or indirectly by torture and state violence through rehabilitative means. Since its founding in 2001 it has been the only organisation in Bolivia dedicated specifically to tackling the issues of torture and state violence.http://www.itei.org.bo/docs/ANTEPROYECTO%20DE%20LEY%20CONTRA%20LA%20TORTURA%20FINAL.pdf , ITEI (2010), p. 3.  Profile  ITEI accompanies people affected by torture and state violence through a process of rehabilitation and extends this treatment to the families and communities of those involved. The organisation is committed to creating a collective consciousness surrounding the psychological effects of torture and state violence through training and investigation. Its stated mission is \\"a socio-political commitment to the creation of a just society that respects human dignity\\". The work of ITEI focuses on the following individuals, families and communities: * those affected by state torture and/or violence * political refugees * those who have returned from exile * survivors of massacres * relatives of those killed, detained or disappeared * those affected by racism ITEI works under the definition of torture as defined by the United Nations Convention Against Torture.  Torture and State Violence under Bolivian Law  On 12 April 1999 the Bolivian government signed the United Nations Convention Against Torture which recommended that \\"the Bolivian state incorporates into its penal legislation the definition of torture as it appears in the Convention, which considers it an offence and imposes sanctions proportionate to the severity of the crime\\".Examination of Reports Presented by State Parties in Conformity with Article 19 of the Convention, UN Convention Against Torture (2000). In December 2005 the Bolivian government signed and ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, agreeing to establish a system of regular and unrestricted visits in places of detention with the aim of preventing torture and other cruel and inhumane acts. However, this has yet to become a reality and violence and torture has continued in Bolivia's prisons, as seen by the death in September 2007 of Justino Porco in Cantumarca Prison in Potos√≠, to cite one example.One Prisoner Escapes and Another Killed in Cantumarca , Los Tiempos, 12 October 2007. Article 15 (I) and Article 114 (I) of the Constitution of Bolivia recognise the right to life and physical integrity, stating that no one will suffer torture or cruel, inhumane, degrading or humiliating treatment, thus guaranteeing full protection to all those within the Bolivian state. Article 295 of the current Bolivian Penal Code sanctions those responsible for acts of torture with a maximum prison sentence of 10 years for acts that result in the death of a tortured person. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted significant developments in the defence of human rights in Bolivia as upheld in the new Constitution of 7 February 2009, especially in the recognition of the rights of Bolivia's indigenous population, which has been disproportionately affected by acts of state violence.Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the activities of her office in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, OHCHR (2010). However, the same report stressed that the laws against torture and state violence in Bolivia remain unsatisfactory, particularly regarding the follow-up to events in Sucre and Pando in 2008, despite increased awareness and sensitivity to these issues.Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the activities of her office in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, OHCHR (2010), Section C. The National Plan of Action on Human Rights 2009-2014 \\"To Live Well\\" recognised the absence of any preventative or punitative legislation against torture and mistreatment, and established the objective of adopting a policy of prevention, vigilance and sanction of torture and cruel, inhumane, degrading or humiliating punishment and treatment, or any other form of attack on physical, psychological, moral or sexual integrity perpetrated by private persons or public functionaries.National Plan of Action on Human Rights 2009 - 2014 To Live Well , Ministry of Justice (2008), p. 1, Point 2.5. It also recommended that the government implement a national preventive mechanism to allow unrestricted access to places of detention.National Plan of Action on Human Rights 2009 - 2014 To Live Well , Ministry of Justice (2008), p. 20. Various human rights organisations have raised concerns over the extent to which legislation against torture has actually been implemented. Amnesty International, for example, is concerned that the extradition requests filed with the US government regarding former Bolivian President Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada and two former ministers, all implicated in the killings of demonstrators in El Alto in 2003, are still pending.Bolivia: Submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review: Seventh Session of the UPR Working Group of the Human Rights Council, February 2010, Amnesty International (2010), Section C. Although legal proceedings were taken against the state officials held responsible for events in Pando 2008, both the UN and Amnesty International have expressed concerns about delays and complications in the judicial process, which has yet to be concluded.Bolivia: Justice for the Pando Case, Amnesty International (2010).  Work  ITEI carries out projects in various areas, engaging not only in the investigation of acts of torture and state violence and the rehabilitation of those affected, but also in the prevention of such incidents. = Sociotherapy = The intervention branch of ITEI is divided into the following: * Medical division, responsible for rehabilitation and prevention * Psychotherapeutic division which provides psychological treatment * Social and legal division which assists reintegration into society Care is offered to anyone affected by torture and state violence. Between 2005 and 2008 some 678 patients were attended to in ITEI's medical centres in La Paz, El Alto and Cochabamba, many of whom were involved in major acts of state violence or repression.ITEI Memoria, 2005-2008 , ITEI (2009), p. 22. In response to the Cochabamba social unrest of 2007, for example, ITEI offered psychological and social care to the 51 men, women and children directly affected by the incident.ITEI Memoria, 2005-2008 , ITEI (2009), p. 13. ITEI continues to provide medical, psychological and judicial assistance to those involved in the events of 24 May 2008 in Sucre when some 60 government supporters were subject to violence and humiliation in the city's main square at the hands of supporters of Bolivia's opposition movement. = Investigation = The investigative department works with those who have been subject to torture or other forms of state violence, or have been forced to \\"disappear\\" or go into exile. The department carries out surveys and interviews, records witness testimonies, launches investigations, publishes articles, provides legal consultation and hosts workshops, seminars and debates.ITEI Memoria, 2005-2008 , ITEI (2009), p. 19. After the events in Sucre in May 2008, for instance, ITEI initiated an emergency project to document what had occurred and produced a report on \\"The Return of Repression: Colonial Racism in Charcas\\", as well as launching a campaign in Europe to raise awareness of what had taken place.The Return of Repression: Colonial Racism in Charcas , ITEI (2008). ITEI also demanded an investigation into the incident before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. = Training = The training department has two principal aims: # To organise workshops in human rights and educate those groups which tend to be discriminated against or are considered at risk # To arrange courses in psychotraumatology for professionals who come into contact with individuals who have been exposed to violence. ITEI also runs workshops alongside other organisations, and oversees psychotherapy sessions. Since 2006 ITEI has been working with young people as part of its \\"Project to Develop Young Aymaran Community Leaders\\" in the towns of Achacachi and Huanuni, training young leaders who have been affected by state violence and continual social upheaval. The aim of the project is that future generations will encourage coexistence in their communities and the creation of a democratic society that acknowledges and respects human rights.http://www.itei.org.bo/achaca.html . = Prison Work = Since March 2008 ITEI has carried out programmes of therapy and investigation with prisoners held in detention centres in the cities of La Paz and Cochabamba. ITEI offers psychological and medical assistance to women and children in prison, as well as to prison staff. The investigations aim to document acts of torture and mistreatment, and detect any violence towards children, as well as to establish: * Where torture is taking place * The methods of torture that are being used * Who is committing torture and acts of violence * Why torture is committed By detecting and denouncing such treatment, as well as by providing instruction, ITEI hopes to prevent future acts of violence and torture in detention centres. It also hopes that its work in prisons will lead to reforms in the prison system that seek to improve conditions for prisoners and respect their human rights. = Draft Bill = In 2007 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bolivia asked ITEI to create a draft bill against torture and for the implementation of a National Preventive Mechanism. Delivered to the president of the Committee of Human Rights in July 2010, ITEI's \\"Draft Bill against Torture and Cruel, Inhumane, Degrading or Humiliating Treatment\\" proposes a prison sentence of 12 to 20 years for those convicted of torture as well as \\"just and adequate compensation\\" for those affected, including full rehabilitation.Law to Punish Torture by the State is Presented , La Razon, 6 July 2010. ITEI, in its explanation of the motives behind the presentation of the draft bill, insists that the current sentences in the Bolivian Penal Code for those found guilty of torture are not in proportion to the offence. According to ITEI, torture has long-lasting physical and psychological effects and therefore the prison sentence should be no shorter than that imposed for murder.Draft Bill against Torture and Cruel, Inhumane, Degrading or Humiliating Treatment , ITEI (2010), p. 4. The draft bill also proposes the implementation of a National Preventive Mechanism - which the Bolivian government is obliged to introduce under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture - to establish a system of regular and unrestricted visits in all places of detention with the aim of putting a stop to torture and inhumane treatment.Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , OHCHR (2002), Part IV. The document mentions various locations where intervention is needed to prevent human rights violations, including police cells, prisons, juvenile detention centres and other police and military establishments.Draft Bill against Torture and Cruel, Inhumane, Degrading or Humiliating Treatment , ITEI (2010), Art. 26 (II). The proposed bill represents a foundation document for the discussion of legislation against torture and other humane treatment in Bolivia.

He is best known for his work with William Strauss on social generations regarding a theorized generational cycle in American history. Howe is currently the managing director of demography at Hedgeye and he is president of Saeculum Research and LifeCourse Associates, consulting companies he founded with Strauss to apply Strauss‚ÄìHowe generational theory. He is also a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Global Aging Initiative, and a senior advisor to the Concord Coalition. Biography Howe was born in Santa Monica, California. His grandfather was the astronomer Robert Julius Trumpler. His father was a physicist and his mother was a professor of occupational therapy. He attended high school in Palo Alto, California, and earned a BA in English Literature at U.C. Berkeley in 1972. He studied abroad in France and Germany, and later earned graduate degrees in economics (M.A., 1978) and history (M.Phil., 1979) from Yale University. After receiving his degrees, Howe worked in Washington, D.C., as a public policy consultant on global aging, long-term fiscal policy, and migration. His positions have included advisor on public policy to the Blackstone Group, policy advisor to the Concord Coalition, and senior associate for the Global Aging Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). During the 1990s, Howe developed a second career as an author, historian and pop sociologist, examining how generational differences shape attitudes, behaviors, and the course of history. He has since written nine books on social generations, mostly with William Strauss. In 1997 Strauss and Howe founded LifeCourse Associates, a publishing, speaking, and consulting company built on their generational theory. As president of LifeCourse, Howe currently provides marketing, personnel, and government affairs consulting to corporate and nonprofit clients, and writes and speaks about the collective personalities of today's generations. Howe lives in Great Falls, Virginia, and has two young adult children. Work Howe has written a number of non- academic books on generational trends. He is best known for his books with William Strauss on generations in American history. These include Generations (1991) and The Fourth Turning (1997) which examine historical generations and describe a theorized cycle of recurring mood eras in American History (now described as the Strauss‚ÄìHowe generational theory). Generations made a deep impression on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who called it the most stimulating book on American history he'd ever read. He even sent a copy to each member of Congress. The Fourth Turning made a deep impression on Steve Bannon, who wrote and directed Generation Zero (2010), a Citizens United Productions film on the book's theory, prior to his becoming White House Chief Strategist. Howe and Strauss also co-authored 13th Gen (1993) about Generation X, and Millennials Rising (2000) about the Millennial Generation. Eric Hoover has called the authors pioneers in a burgeoning industry of consultants, speakers and researchers focused on generations. He wrote a critical piece about the concept of \\"generations\\" and the \\"Millennials\\" (a term coined by Strauss and Howe) for the Chronicle of Higher Education. Michael Lind offered his critique of Howe's book \\"Generations\\" for The New York Times Book Review. Howe has written a number of application books with Strauss about the Millennials‚Äô impact on various sectors, including Millennials Go to College (2003, 2007), Millennials and the Pop Culture (2006), and Millennials and K-12 Schools (2008). After Strauss died in 2007, Howe authored Millennials in the Workplace (2010). In 1988, he coauthored On Borrowed Time with Peter G. Peterson, one of the early calls for budgetary reform (the book was reissued 2004). Since the late 1990s, Howe has also coauthored a number of academic studies published by CSIS, including the Global Aging Initiative‚Äôs Aging Vulnerability Index and The Graying of the Middle Kingdom: The Economics and Demographics of Retirement Policy in China. In 2008, he co-authored The Graying of the Great Powers with Richard Jackson.

The book had been originally published by Gaspereau Press, a boutique firm based in Nova Scotia which is one of Canada's only book publishing companies that still binds and prints its own books, with the result that the firm had difficulty meeting the increased demand after Skibsrud's win was announced.\\"Author's angst grows over unavailability of Giller winner\\". The Globe and Mail, November 11, 2010. Chapters-Indigo, Canada's primary bookstore chain, did not have a single copy of the book in stock anywhere in Canada in the entire week of the Giller announcement. However, the paper book's unavailability resulted in a significant increase in ebook sales; the ebook version of the novel quickly became the top-selling title in the Kobo ebookstore.\\"Scarcity of Giller- winning ‚ÄòSentimentalists‚Äô a boon to eBook sales\\". Toronto Star, November 12, 2010. The company subsequently announced that it had sold the novel's trade paperback rights to Douglas & McIntyre, while it will continue to print a smaller run of the novel's original edition for book collectors.\\"Deal clears way for Skibsrud‚Äôs Giller novel to ship this week\\". Toronto Star, November 15, 2010. In spring 2011, The Sentimentalists was published in the United States by W. W. Norton & Company. The book has been translated, or is currently being translated, into five languages. Skibsrud's first collection of short stories, This Will Be Difficult to Explain, and Other Stories, was first published in September 2011 by Hamish Hamilton Canada, with US and UK editions of the book appearing in spring 2012. =Quartet for the End of Time= In 2014 Skibsrud's second novel, Quartet for the End of Time, was published by Hamish Hamilton.

Service The 29th Maine Infantry was organized at Augusta, Maine and mustered in on December 17, 1863, for three years' service. The regiment was composed primarily of re-enlisted veterans of the 10th Maine Infantry, and its full name was the 29th Maine Veteran Volunteer Infantry. The regiment was under the command of Colonel George Lafayette Beal, previously the commander of the 10th Maine Infantry, who also served as their brigade commander from April 19, 1864. Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Emerson was the acting commander of the regiment until he was sent back to Maine on account of illness on August 27, 1864. Command then devolved on Major William Knowlton, who died of wounds received at the Battle of Opequon on September 20, 1864. Captain George H. Nye was then promoted to major on October 18, 1864, and assumed command of the regiment. Colonel Beal was promoted to brigadier general while Major Nye was elected by a vote of the regiment's officers to become the regimental commander and was promoted to colonel, both on November 30, 1864. Company A and Company D were transferred in from the 10th Maine Infantry Battalion (which was disbanded at this time) on May 30, 1864. The 10th Maine Battalion was composed of three-year men from the 10th Maine Infantry. The regiment was attached to 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, XIX Corps, Department of the Gulf, to July 1864. 1st Brigade, 1st Division, XIX Corps, Department of the Gulf and Army of the Shenandoah, Middle Military Division, to March 1865. 1st Brigade, 1st Division, Army of the Shenandoah, to April 1865. 1st Brigade, 1st Division, Department of Washington, to June 1865.

Company A mustered out October 18, 1864 (having departed from the field in the Shenandoah Valley October 5, 1864) at the expiration of its original enlistment, and was replaced by the one-year men of the 1st Unassigned Company of Maine Infantry as \\"new\\" Company A, which reported for duty October 6, 1864. The remainder of the 29th Maine Infantry mustered out of service June 21, 1866. The regiment's history, History of the 1st-10th-29th Maine Regiment, was written by Major John Mead Gould.

Casualties The regiment lost a total of 237 men during service; 2 officers and 40 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, 4 officers and 191 enlisted men due to disease. Lineage The 1st Maine Infantry Regiment was originally formed in state service in 1854 as the 1st Regiment of Light Infantry of the Maine Volunteer Militia,United States Army, Harbor Defenses of Portland, pp. 42, 98 and thus was older than any other Maine regimental organization. (The 1st Light Infantry was, in turn, descendant from the Cumberland County Regiment formed in 1760.)https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/eng/0133enbn.htm The 1st Maine Infantry was mustered into Federal service in May 1861, served in the defense of Washington, D.C. and was mustered out in August 1861. That same month, the 10th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment was formed with a majority of its soldiers being veterans of the 1st Maine. In 1863 the bulk of the 10th Maine was mustered out except for three companies of soldiers who had enlisted for three, rather than two, years and the unit was known as the 10th Maine Battalion. The soldiers of the 10th Maine Battalion were absorbed into the 29th Maine (formed in December 1863) in May 1864. Many soldiers who had served in the 10th Maine Regiment re-enlisted in the 29th Maine. This was the basis of the claim that the 1st, 10th and 29th Maine Regiments were, effectively, the same unit. An historian of the 240th AAA (Anti-Aircraft Artillery) Group, a former Maine Army National Guard unit, has concluded that numerous subsequent Volunteer Maine Militia and Maine National Guard units, including the 29th Maine, inherited the lineage of the 1st Maine via the Portland Light Infantry company.Units descended from 1st Maine From 1924 through 1944 this lineage was carried by the 240th Coast Artillery Regiment.United States Army, Harbor Defenses of Portland, p. 56 As of 2018 this lineage is carried by the 240th Regional Training Institute, Maine Army National Guard, in Bangor.240th Regional Training Institute at the Maine Army National Guard website The 29th Maine is also one of the \\"ancestor\\" units, along with the famed 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, of the modern day 133rd Engineer Battalion of the Maine Army National Guard.Lineage and Honors of the 133rd Engineer Battalion Commanders * Colonel George Lafayette Beal ‚Äì December 17, 1863 ‚Äì April 19, 1864 (reassigned as brigade commander) * Lieutenant Colonel Charles S.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands in a remote position close to the Wales‚ÄìEngland border overlooking the River Monnow. History The church dates from the 12th and 13th centuries. During the 20th century the chancel and vestry were restored. The church was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 April 1985. It has been suggested that the church was founded by the Celtic Saint Ridol (or Ryddol) and was re-dedicated to St John the Baptist only in the Norman period. The church has been described as \\"one of the most isolated churches in Herefordshire\\" and is approached by a grassed track across two fields.\\"St John the Baptist, Llanrothal, Herefordshire\\" at churchcrawler.blogspot.co.uk It lies a few hundred yards from the river. Architecture The exterior of the church has been rendered. Its plan is simple, consisting of a nave and a chancel, with a north porch, which was previously a vestry. In the north wall of the nave is a Norman round-headed window from the 12th century, and a window from the 13th century with a trefoil head. There are two windows similar to the latter in the south wall. In the south wall of the chancel is a large four-light window. The east window has two lights, with a circular window above. Inside the church is a 17th- century panelled pulpit, and a brass chandelier which was donated by Ivor Bulmer-Thomas. The font is a simple bowl on a narrow pedestal dating from the Norman period. It is decorated with a cross patt√©e, although there is no known association with the Knights Templar. The altar is simple and consists of a stone slab resting on two blocks of stone.

The ad campaign presents a fictitious vehicle that satirizes the American mid-sized sedan market. Without attacking specific automobile manufacturers, Subaru of America created the Mediocrity, a fictional sedan that exemplifies all of the typical features found on mid-sized sedans in 2010.  Campaign  The 2011 Mediocrity launch was designed to promote the Subaru Legacy. The campaign started with a digital postcard sent out to key industry insiders, which drove them to a website and informed them of the launch date. A Facebook page was created right before launch to help spark conversations about the car. Some cryptic Tweets also went out pre-launch to help generate awareness of an approaching ‚Äúbig event‚Äù. On October 1, 2010 the official website, 2011Mediocrity.com, went live. Three days later, a television campaign directed by Baker Smith of Harvest Films was launched with a series of television advertisements and rich media. Banners and 15- and 30-second video ‚Äúpre-rolls‚Äù were deployed, with all communications directing consumers to the Mediocrity website. Finally, car shopping sites offered \\"Expert Reviews\\"Auto Trader Review of the car and ‚ÄúCompetitive Comparisons‚Äù to other cars listed on the sites. The campaign was picked up from bloggers in the automotive industry like Jalopnik,Jalopnik USA TodayUSA Today and AutoGuide.com.AutoGuide.com.

Fiberglass was added to strip away lines and transform the body of the sedan. The creative team from advertising agency Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, Minnesota chose colors (Medium Crumb/Stale Biscuit) and designed logos, thereby finishing off the design. Production on the campaign began July 21, 2010. One advertisement for the Mediocrity features commentary from the \\"designers\\" of the car, noting that there are no features on the car that stand out from other mid-size sedans on the road. Notable \\"features\\" include doors, windows, a steering wheel, four doors, headlights, mirrors, windows, brakes, and no \\"bells or whistles\\".

Fabio then confesses that he is a bad singer. Cosgrove changes her mind and decides that Big Time Rush should sing Fabio's part in \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\". Gustavo records it live when the song starts. After recording the second song, Gustavo gets run over by Snoop Dogg's limousine. Big Time Rush asks Dogg to sing a duet with them and he agrees. They record \\"12 Days of Christmas\\" with a twist of rap. After recording the third song, the band finally finish the EP but Griffin decides to record another song to complete the EP because he heard Justin Bieber's eight-hour song \\"50 Days of Christmas\\" featuring 50 Cent. Gustavo has a breakdown inside the studio and Kendall changes his voice to a Chipmunk-esque voice and agrees to record another song with Snoop called \\"Let's Stay in Our PJs (All Christmas Long)\\". After recording the final song, the band leaves the studio for the holiday, only to discover that a blizzard has closed down all flights to the Midwest. Katie then comes forward and suggests they make some Christmas happen in L.A., which they do by bringing the studio decorations to the Palmwoods and installing them in the lobby for Mr. Bitters, to show him what it's like to celebrate Christmas the way you're supposed to ‚Äì with friends. Gustavo and Kelly soon arrive as well; he missed his flight to Fiji and figured he might as well spend Christmas with the boys. He also reveals to them that he brought a Christmas feast, and as they all sit down to eat, the film comes to a close as the narrator wishes everyone a 'Big Time' Christmas. =Sub-plot= Mrs. Knight attempts packing up all the family presents so she won't have to pay a luggage fee at the airport. Katie tries to bring Christmas spirit to a Scrooge-esque Mr. Bitters. She starts by trying to invite him over to watch It's a Wonderful Life; however, at the end of it, he comments on what the Palmwoods would be like if he hadn't been born. Katie then imagines this as well, with a hunky new manager throwing a dance party. After watching her act out her vision, Bitters angrily claims that he doesn't care that no one likes him and would rather have Christmas on his own. In the end, Katie makes up for this by setting up their Christmas in the Palm Woods and giving him the presents they were going to take to Minnesota.

It was sold as the Mazda 808 in some export markets including Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, and as the Mazda 818 in many others. The body style configurations offered were a two-door coup√©, a four- door sedan, and a five-door station wagon. The Grand Familia offered only inline four cylinder engines. The largely identical rotary-powered versions were marketed as the Mazda Savanna in Japan, with export markets taking this model as the Mazda RX-3. The Grand Familia/Savanna were originally intended to replace the smaller Mazda Familia to better compete with the Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sunny, and Mitsubishi Colt. With the onset of the 1970s energy crisis however, the Familia sold better due to its fuel economy. Since Mazda had already developed the Grand Familia/Savanna, it was sent to North America, while it was considered in Japan as an alternative to the Corolla clone, the Toyota Sprinter, Nissan Cherry, and the Mitsubishi Lancer.  Standard engine  = Japan = This generation was available in coup√©, sedan, and station wagon forms. Engines were inline four-cylinder units and included a 1,272 cc and a 1,490 cc option, called the \\"Grand Familia S\\" in Japan. The 1.5 was replaced by a larger 1.6-liter four in November 1973, an engine which had already been used in some export markets (like the United States) for over two years. In the Japanese market, myriad equipment levels were available, ranging from the very basic 1300 Standard to the most luxurious 1500 GL II (\\"GF II\\" for the coup√©). Originally, only a four-speed manual transmission was available. Later desmogged versions were sold as the \\"Grand Familia AP\\", with AP standing for \\"Anti Pollution\\". Power outputs for these models were considerably lower.

This name was given only to the 1.6 L version of the Grand Familia. The 808 cost $2,997, which was some $200 above the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla. The car came with a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. Early models used the same four- headlight nose as the rotary model. Engine: 1972‚Äì1977 ‚Äì 1.6 L (1586 cc) NA I4, single-barrel, and For 1976 and 1977, the 1.3 L version was sold as the \\"Mazda Mizer\\" in the United States. Engine: 1976‚Äì1977 ‚Äì 1.3 L (1272 cc) TC I4, twin- barrel, and = South Korea (Kia Brisa II/K303) = From October 1975 the Grand Familia was built in South Korea by Kia Motors, with the 1272 cc engine and four-door bodywork. Originally it was sold as the Brisa II, alongside the smaller Brisa, based on the Familia Presto. The early cars had rectangular lights, but in December 1976 an updated version with single round headlights was introduced, called the Kia K303. A station wagon model of the K303 was added in 1978. Production ended in 1981, when the license expired. As part of a nationwide industrial plan Kia was then excluded from building passenger cars until 1986. The Brisa II and K-303 are exceedingly rare today (as are classic cars generally in South Korea). There is currently a single such car registered in the entire country.

Internationally it was called the Mazda RX-3. It was smaller and sportier than its brother, the Capella Rotary/RX-2, and was largely identical to its conventional inline-four donor model, the Mazda Grand Familia. It was available from September 1971 through 1978 in Super Deluxe coup√©, Deluxe sedan, and station wagon forms. The Super Deluxe coup√© was heavier (884 kg vs 864 kg) and carried an optional body stripe, clock, rear defogger and the centre console/high armrest and collapsible steering column. Sold from 1972 through 1978 in the United States, the RX-3 version was extremely successful. It originally used a 10A rotary engine like the Mazda Familia Rotary Coupe/Mazda R100, but US cars shared the larger 12A engine from the RX-2. Performance-wise the 10A RX-3 was not able to match the RX-2 with 12A. With a weight-to-power ratio of 10.9 kg per kW compared to the RX-2's 9.9 kg per kW, the RX-3 was slower. The 12A RX-3 wasn't able to match the RX-2 with 12A either, despite its lighter weight. The smaller engined version has the internal model code S102A, while the larger one is known as the S124A. In Japan, the installation of a rotary engine gave Japanese buyers a financial advantage when it came time to pay the annual road tax in that they bought a car that was more powerful than a traditional inline engine, but without having the penalty for having an engine in the higher 1.5 litre tax bracket. = Series I S102A & S124A (1971‚Äì1973) = The first Mazda Savanna went on sale in September 1971 and remained in production until 1977. It was sold as the Mazda RX-3 internationally when installed with the rotary engine and was otherwise largely identical to the inline-four-equipped Mazda Grand Familia. Externally the Savanna and export RX-3 was differentiated from its piston engines sibling by a nose panel with dual round headlights and a more prominent and pointed honeycomb grille, and round tail lights on the rear of sedans and coup√©s. A station wagon version, the RX-3 Sports Wagon, was sold for just one year in the U.S., from 1972 to 1973, when it was replaced by the Luce/RX-4 wagon. However the \\"Savanna Sports Wagon\\" remained in production in Japan right through until the end of Savanna production in 1977. Initially in all markets except North America all cars were designated S102A and came with the 982 cc (2x491 cc) 10A. S124A cars introduced later on came with the 1146 cc (2x573 cc) 12A. While the larger S124A eventually replaced the S102A in most markets, the S102A remained on sale alongside the S124A in Japan through to early 1974 with all the Series II updates. The Series I S102A remained on sale in some markets even longer, being available in the United Kingdom until the 1975 model year at least, though this was most likely as a result of stocks of earlier production vehicles remaining unsold due to a combination of both the fuel crisis and the rotary engine's early reputation for poor reliability. While the Series I Savanna and RX-3 were powered by the 10A in Japan, Australia, and Europe, North American markets got the larger 12A taken from the RX-2 coupled to either a four speed manual or automatic transmission. Along with this engine change came the chassis prefix S124A. The 1972 Savanna / RX-3 Sports Wagon was the world's first rotary-powered station wagon. In September 1972 the Savanna GT went on sale exclusively in Japan. This model received the larger 12A motor with 125 hp and was coupled to a five speed transmission. Along with this came slightly lowered suspension, as well as wider 5.5\\" rims. It received revised tail lights and a 5 Speed badge on the rear, an RE12 badge on the grille, and a completely redesigned dashboard and console exclusive to the model. It also had unique leather-like vinyl upholstery with GT embossed on the headrests. It came also with the chassis code S124A. The 10A engine output was 105 hp (78 kW) and 100 lb¬∑ft (135 Nm). 0‚Äì60 mph (0‚Äì97 km/h) acceleration time was 10.8 seconds, and the car ran a 17.6 second quarter-mile (400 m)(16.3 for the RX-2). In 1972 all rotary engines had their die-cast rotor housing coated with a new process: The new Transplant Coating Process (TCP) featured sprayed-on steel which is then coated with chrome, giving greatly increased engine life. = Series II & III S102A & 124A (1973‚Äì1978) = Mazda Savanna (S124; Series 3) In mid 1973, Mazda released a visually updated Savanna in Japan, though drivetrain choices remained the same with the S102A 10A and the S124A 12A both available in twin distributor form. Externally the entire front end sheet metal was revamped and a different set of taillights with twin brake lights were included (commonly known as Savanna tail lights in Australia). In the months that followed, the range was updated to the single distributor 12A and the 10A motor was discontinued in early 1974. The Series II RX-3 came to Australia in March 1974 powered by the new 12A single distributor (12B). The starter motor was relocated in these updated engines from the top of the engine to the lower left hand rear side. Other internal 12A changes included moving from dual row side seals to single row and significant changes to apex seal design. The Series II was slower than the 10A Series I down the quarter mile even with the 1,146 cc 12A's greater capacity and 15 percent more power. The Rotary Engine Anti Pollution System (REAPS) hurt torque. As a result, the Series 2 was slow off the mark but had a better top speed. The loss of torque plus a 44-kilo weight increase slowed the Series II to a 17.8 second quarter mile. Interior changes were minor and included a change from the km/h/mph speedometer to a 200 km/h speedometer (180 km/h for the 808), an exhaust overhead light, a 50 Amp ammeter (up from 30 Amps) plus design changes to the trims and seat belts. Notably the radio antenna was enhanced by a twin post (rather than single) design. The 1974 model kept the three spoke plastic wood grain steering wheel; the 1975 received a fake leather wheel with slots cut into its three spokes. The new 12A single distributor engine output was 130 hp (97 kW) and 115 lb¬∑ft (156 Nm). 0‚Äì60 mph (0‚Äì97 km/h) time was 10.8 seconds, and the car ran a 17.7 second quarter-mile (400 m). The Japanese market Savanna was updated visually in June 1973, though drive lines weren't updated until later in the year. Mazda put the new 12A \\"AP\\" single-distributor engine in the RX-3 in late 1973. It was refreshed again in 1975 with a \\"REAPS-5\\" engine. In 1976 the Series III Savanna / RX-3 was released in Japan and the U.S., but exports to Australia and New Zealand ceased. The nose cone wore a new lower spoiler-type lip, and the rotor shaped badge was replaced with a new Mazda corporate font badge on the grille, offset to the left of centre. Overall these and other detail changes made the cars much plainer, and certainly lost the model some of its charm. In the U.S. the 1976 rear lights were hexagons. The 1977 rear lights were rectangular. An optional RX-3 'special appearance package' called the RX-3sp was sold in 1977 to advertise the new 75,000 mile engine guarantee for rotary engines. The 1978 RX-3's were only sold as 'off road' (race) versions. The Savanna and RX-3 production was phased out in 1978 to make room for the new Mazda RX-7. Of all the pre-RX-7 rotary vehicles Mazda built (930,000 in total), the RX-3 was by far the most popular. Of all the RX-3's built, the coupe exceeded 50 percent of total sale ‚Äì all facts which influenced the design profile of the RX-7. The rotary engine had financial advantages to Japanese consumers in that the engine displacement remained below 1.5 litres, a significant determination when paying the Japanese annual road tax which kept the obligation affordable to most buyers, while having more power than the traditional inline engines. = Racing = The Savanna/RX-3 was the next Mazda racing entry, following up the success of the Cosmo and Familia Rotary. The Savanna debuted with a win at the September, 1971 \\"Fuji 500\\" race. The cars battled with Nissan's Skyline on the Japanese Grand Prix in 1972, winning the touring car category there and preventing the GT-R from winning 50 consecutive races. The cars continued to be competitive, claiming over 100 victories by 1976. A special edition \\"V100\\" model was released for sale in Japan to commemorate this occasion. Many vehicles continue in club racing to this day. In Australia the RX-3 proved very successful both on and off the race track. One of many RX-3s racing in the 1975 Bathurst 1000 caused more than a worried look after placing fifth outright and 1st in its class for the second consecutive year after its initial class win in 1974. The RX-3 dominated the class C in 1975 holding 4 of the top 5 positions. In North America, the RX-3 had much success in SCCA and IMSA competition. Many RX-3s are still competing and one in particular is the SCCA Super Production car driven by Irish driver John Cummins. The RX-3 was replaced with the Mazda RX-4.

Early life Joseph Kirtley Carson Jr. was born on December 19, 1891, in the village of McKinney, Kentucky, the son of Joseph Kelly Carson and Sallie Elizabeth Adeline (Johnson). His family moved several times before arriving in Hood River, Oregon in 1903. Joseph graduated from high school in Hood River, and then moved to Portland in 1914. He graduated from the University of Oregon School of Law on May 4, 1917. On the same day he was admitted to the Oregon State Bar he also joined the 12th Company of the Oregon regiment of coast artillery. He served as a private at Fort Stevens at the mouth of the Columbia River. He made sergeant in August 1917. He served at Fort Stevens and Fort Canby until February 1918. His next service was at Fort Monroe in Virginia. In April 1918 he traveled to Florida to serve as an instructor at Camp Joseph E. Johnston where he was promoted to second lieutenant. In World War I he was sent on the U.S.S. Kroonland to France where he landed in October 1918. He served with the 301st railhead detachment, and was discharged in October 1919 with the rank of first lieutenant. Early political career In 1922, Carson was elected a Democratic precinct committeeman. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Oregon state legislature in 1922, 1924, and 1926. In 1928 he was a candidate to represent a congressional district at the Democratic National Convention. Arriving back in Oregon he began a correspondence with Franklin Delano Roosevelt that would last four years. Mayor of Portland When George Luis Baker chose not to try for re-election as mayor, Joseph decided to run. He was elected November 8, 1932, to take office July 1, 1933. One of his first acts was to appoint his former coastal artillery colonel Berton K. Lawson as police chief of Portland. Carson was mayor of Portland during the depression. He became a vocal critic of the Works Progress Administration. A conservative Democrat who believed in rugged individualism, he stopped several New Deal initiatives. Government deficit spending was anathema to him. He set the tone at a Rotary Club meeting in 1932: \\"We must quit asking the government to be a nurse to everything. We must realize that the people support the government, not that the government supports the people\\". A waterfront strike of longshoremen in 1934 was considered by Carson to be the most unpleasant event of his mayoral administration. Post mayoral career Carson did not seek re-election in 1940 but instead returned to private law practice. He served in World War II, retiring as a full colonel in 1945. He was appointed by President Harry S. Truman to the United States Maritime Commission in 1947 until the commission was abolished and replaced in 1950. He then became the vice president of the Propeller Club of the United States, headquartered in New York. He returned to his law practice in Portland in 1953 and in the 1954 Oregon gubernatorial election, he was the Democratic nominee for governor but lost to Paul L. Patterson in the general election. Personal Carson married his first wife, Hazel Irene Jenkins of Pendleton, Oregon on March 26, 1926. She died of tuberculosis on May 4, 1928. He became the first and thus far the only mayor of Portland to be married while in office when he married Myrtle Cradick of Portland in the White Temple on June 19, 1937. They had one daughter, Mrs. Richard (Joan) Staley, and one son, Lucian Joseph (August 10, 1939 ‚Äì January 19, 1990). His wife Myrtle died on February 25, 1982. He served as the president (Commander?) of the state American Legion in 1941. He also belonged to the Last Man Club, the Hood River Lodge, Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons, York Rite bodies of Masonry, the University Club of Portland, the Arlington Club, Columbia Edgewater Country Club, Woodmen of the World, Delta Theta Phi, and the state and Multnomah County bar association. As a young man, he enjoyed playing baseball. He was appointed the first Oregon state chairman of junior baseball for the American Legion. He had a great interest in biography (his favorite work was The Life of John Marshall by Albert J. Beveridge), and portraits of the presidents were hung in his law offices. Carson died of a coronary thrombosis suffered at his home on the morning of December 20, 1956.

One recurring theme is the desaparecidos and the attempts to recover their bodies and memorialize them. Her novel Ganarse la muerte was banned by the government because of the obvious political message. Gambaro is Argentina's most celebrated playwright, and she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1982, as well as many other prizes.

Jonathan Lovett for The Stage stated: \\"Receiving a worthy tribute, in its long overdue UK premiere, this atmospheric production succeeds in weaving comedy into menace, and vice versa, helped by Kostas Panagiotou‚Äôs evocative score\\". \\"Brilliantly capturing a period of mistrust and state-sponsored violence, she turned to the story of Cain and Abel, depicting one brother destroying another while adding some deeply unsavoury characters on the side of the police.\\" \\"Though Siamese Twins was first produced in 1967, before the worst excesses of the Argentinean Dirty War and the abduction and often murder of the \\"Disappeared\\", for long periods the country had had authoritarian regimes. One cannot help wondering whether the first audiences for this play would have identified the menacing figures who appear in it with particular political or public faces. On one hand this play is an outcry and a prescient warning about this the misuse of authority and fearful acquiescence before it and on the other a picture of the exploitation, cruelty and even torture that even partners or siblings can inflict upon each other.\\" Howard Loxton for the British Theatre Guide *In 4 July 1991 'Putting Two and Two Together' (Atando cabos ) by Gambaro translated by Nick Drake was given its UK premiere at the Royal Court Theatre directed by James McDonald.

Life Andrew Balfour was born on 18 January 1630, the son of Sir Michael Balfour of Denmilne, Fife, and Joanna Durham. Balfour received his early education at the parish school of Abdie, before studying philosophy at St. Andrews, where he studied philosophy and arithmetic under Thomas Glegg and graduated with an MA in 1650. Balfour's oldest brother, Sir James Balfour, encouraged him to collect literary, antiquarian and natural history objects. He moved to London and in 1650 became a pupil to John Wedderburn, the King's physician. After London, Balfour travelled to France in 1657 where he studied medicine in Paris and at the University of Caen. Balfour obtained a degree with a dissertation entitled De Venae Sectione in Dysenteria. Returning to London, he became a governor end of 1661 to John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, travelling to France and Italy with him from end of 1661 to 1664. In 1667, Balfour set up medical practice in St Andrews. By this time, he had amassed a large collection of scientific and medical books, curiosities and instruments: his 'rarities' were called the 'Museaum Balfourianum' by contemporaries. In 1670, he moved to set up practice in Edinburgh.Janet Browne, 'Balfour, Sir Andrew, first baronet (1630‚Äì1694), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2010, accessed 5 October 2010 He planted a small botanical garden next to his house. Balfour's cousin was Robert Sibbald, whom he succeeded as third president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1684. Balfour and Sibbald set up a garden together near Holyrood Abbey, which Balfour subsequently persuaded the university to fund. Balfour and Sibbald were also key figures in the creation of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia. Sutherland's catalogue of 1684 indicates that the garden had about 2,000 non- indigenous species. After Balfour's death, his library was sold, with a printed catalogue listing 3,501 items.Bibliotheca Balfouriana, sive catologus librorum, in quavis lingua & facultate insignium illustri viri D.

Other books of Balfour's appear to have been sold with those of his older brother James in 1699.

His successors further added to this style, leading to the unique and individualistic style of Mughal architecture. Some examples of this style are Humayun's Tomb, which was the first of a long succession of garden-tombs (and a predecessor of the Taj Mahal), the Agra Fort, the Allahabad Fort, the Lahore Fort, the abandoned city of Fatehpur Sikri and Akbar's own tomb. History of the style Akbar was the third Mughal Emperor and also the architect of the Mughal Empire in India. Although he was illiterate, Akbar showed a profound interest in Literature and the Arts. That, coupled with his pride and curiosity of his Timurid ancestry and the desire to embrace India as a native country, were the beginnings of his religious and design philosophies. In its essence, the style consisted of a synthesis of earlier styles, Hindu/Jain/Buddhist and Persian/Timurid. Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, Akbar's court chronicler, and one of his 'Navratnas' or nine gems of his court, describes the architects and designers as lofty minded mathematicians and says the Emperor's style of architecture was understandable only to the scientifically oriented. The artisans who migrated with his father from Persia brought in their styles, which mingled with the indigenous styles of India. The lavish use of red sandstone sought to minimize the stylistic clashes consequent to the mixing of these disparate elements. All these buildings reflected Akbar's design and architectural philosophy. This is the \\"Akbari\\" style of architecture For example, Akbar's tomb, though Islamic in spirit, is a blend of styles. The magnificent entrance, use of exquisite patterns, excellent jaali work (intricately perforated decorative stone screens), fine Persian style calligraphy, the charbagh garden layout (four-quartered garden layout, with the main building at the center), etc., are representative of Islamic influence. On the other hand, the absence of a dome, use of chhatris (small domed canopies, supported by pillars), tiers of airy pavilions, etc., reflect a local influence, which are also found in the buildings built by Akbar in Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. As with all the other administrative and political aspects of Akbar's imperial career, it was Sher Shah Suri's architecture that he drew inspiration from. Suri architecture was a continuation of the older Lodi Style.

The university did not offer a film program in terms of production, so Schrader focused on film history, theory, and analysis. As the writer/director team was leaving college they decided that it was either make a film or \\"settle\\" for a mundane job within the film industry. On the afternoon of their graduation from college, they traveled to San Diego to begin pre-production on creating a 1970s style acid movie about Satanists. The film was shot on locations in Escondido, Lakehead, Los Angeles, Ramona, and Santa Barbara, California. The film was created on a low budget over a two-year period, and had its world premiere on July 24, 2009 in Los Angeles.

In a positive review, Quiet Earth wrote, \\"There's enough material, visually and semantically, in there to get you brain fried and scrambled, and leave you with a stupid contented face for hours.\\" Fatally- Yours stated that they were so impressed with the film that they were initially at a loss for words and found it difficult to express the emotions engendered after having watched it. Fangoria wrote that the film's subtitle, Band of Satanic Outsiders was a favorite that \\"howls that this film is full of fun Mephistopilean escapades!\\". The Movies Made Me reviewer stated that he was \\"never big on the overly psychedelic style of film\\", but that the trailer \\"looked like it had a lot of fun to offer\\" and after having watched the film he found no reason to regret having done so, as the psychedelic aspects were selectively used. Though he stated the acting was better than expected, he faulted the film's pacing in the last 30 minutes. 10,000 Bullets wrote that, from a production standpoint, \\"just about every aspect of Fever Night is pitch perfect. The direction is stylish, the film's ambient sounds capes are superbly realized and the acting fare exceeded my expectations,\\" but by the film's finale, it began \\"to lose its way\\".

Headquarters for the Division of the Pacific and the Department of California remained in the City of San Francisco. = Events within the Division of the Pacific= On March 18, 1868, the Army established the Department of Alaska under the Division of the Pacific. Department of Alaska was discontinued on July 1, 1870, and Alaska was absorbed by the Department of the Columbia. The Department of Arizona was established under the Division of the Pacific on April 15, 1870. It consisted of Arizona Territory and California south of a line from the northwest corner of Arizona to Point Conception so as to include most of Southern California. From December 7, 1871, the one general officer at San Francisco commanded both the Division of the Pacific and the Department of California and the separate staffs were consolidated into one. On July 1, 1878, Division of the Pacific headquarters moved from San Francisco to the Presidio of San Francisco. In June 1875, the part of the Territory of Idaho that lay east of the extension of the western boundary of Utah, and including Fort Hall, was detached from the Department of Columbia and added to the Department of the Platte. On July 1, 1876 Gen. Irvin McDowell, formerly commander of the Department of the Pacific was for a second time assigned to the command of the Pacific coast Division, which comprised also the Department of the Columbia, commanded by Brig. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, and the Department of Arizona, commanded by Col. O. B. Willcox, 12th Infantry Regiment. The Department of Arizona lost Southern California on February 14, 1883, but regained California south of the 35th parallel on December 15, 1886. The Department of California, consisted of California north of the 35th parallel and Nevada. On November 30, 1885, the New Mexico Territory transferred from the Department of the Missouri to the Department of Arizona, coming under the Division of the Pacific. Early in 1887 the headquarters of the Division of the Pacific, failed to secure an appropriation for a suitable administration building and moved from the Presidio of San Francisco back to the City of San Francisco. End of the Military Division of the Pacific The Military Division of the Pacific was discontinued on July 3, 1891.

Areas  = Gambling addiction = Commitments to promoting awareness of gambling addiction is included within the concept of responsible gambling, and can include customer-imposed limits and self- exclusion schemes. In the United Kingdom, several major banks have also offered the ability for customers to block gambling-related translations on their credit cards. NatWest introduced a pilot in October 2019 to allow GamCare appointments to be scheduled at selected branches. Earlier in the year, the UK also imposed bet limits on fixed odds betting terminals as part of an effort to control gambling addiction associated with them. In the interest of combating addiction, gambling operators in the UK are also obliged to provide certain tools allowing players to restrict their own play. These include: * Self Exclusion / Time Out ‚Äì allowing players to put their account on temporary (reversible) hiatus. * Reality Check ‚Äì a pop-up is triggered at certain time intervals to remind players to take a break / stop playing. * Time Limits ‚Äì used for setting strict time limits on playing sessions. * Deposit Limits / Account Tracker ‚Äì used for enforcing a limit on deposits. * Permanent Account Closure ‚Äì lets players close their account, and cut off all contact from the gambling operator. = Underage gambling = The industry has also partaken in commitments to prevent those who are not appropriately-aged from participating in gambling activities. Key initiatives have included the efforts of the American Gaming Association (AGA), which adopted a comprehensive guideline for underage gambling, as well as the unattended minors guideline developed with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. In 2017, the organization announced a code of conduct for its members, which included specific training requirements for employees to deal with underage gaming. = Fraudulent and criminal behaviour = Operators are required to implement anti-money laundering policies and procedures. This involves implementing effective know your customer processes when taking on new customers and tracking and reporting any suspicious transactions. = Information privacy = Information privacy refers to the protection of customer data and records against unauthorised or unnecessary disclosure. Operators are required to implement policies that ensure controls and measures are in place to prevent unauthorised disclosure and use of customer information. Customer information typically relates to data such as name, address, age, telephone number and email address. = Prompt and accurate customer payments = Operators must ensure that payments to and from customer accounts must be conducted according to formal and documented processes in an accurate and timely manner. Operators typically ensure that customer funds are managed separately from their own accounts and that they have sufficient cleared funds to pay all player prize wins and outstanding player balances. = Fair gaming = All gaming products should be tested to ensure they are fair and random and that they adhere to the rules of that game. Testing to ensure fair gaming is increasingly carried out by independent organisations. = Ethical and responsible marketing = Operators should comply with the relevant regulatory advertising codes of practice which typically ensure that advertisements are factually correct and do not target underage or vulnerable gamblers, such as players who have self-excluded themselves from gambling. It is also expected that operators should seek permission from the customer prior to engaging in direct marketing through use of the customer‚Äôs personal details. = Customer satisfaction = Customers should be able to freely make comments or complaints to operators and expect operators to have in place adequate processes and procedures to deal with complaints, either internally or via an independent third-party. For example, ecogra.org provides a mediation service for disputes between players and operators. = Secure, safe and reliable operating environment = Operators are required to demonstrate internal controls and processes that adhere to the licensing conditions as stipulated by the regulatory jurisdiction that issues gaming and gambling licenses. Internal controls should also be implemented to ensure that all operational, payment and technical systems and processes operate securely and effectively. In addition, operators need to demonstrate adequate business continuity management procedures to ensure that operations can continue in the event of unforeseen circumstances or disasters.  Responsible gaming codes of conduct  To ensure operators, software suppliers and associated service providers uphold the principles of responsible gaming, codes of conduct have been developed by numerous regulators, trade associations and non-profit organisations. These competing and overlapping codes of conduct or standards have evolved over time due to the evolution of multiple legal and trade frameworks. It has been acknowledged within the industry that given the large number of responsible gaming codes of conduct there is a need to step back and re-assess what is required within the industry. The European Committee for Standardisation is the process of developing Responsible Remote Gambling Measures that can protect customers and ensure that the remote gambling operators, software suppliers and associated service providers behave responsibly, which would be adopted on a voluntary basis.  Responsible gaming events  A number of industry events have been organised to help the industry promote responsible gaming practices. The European Gaming and Betting Association organised the EGBA Responsible Gaming Day conference in the European Parliament in October 2010. The World Lotteries Association has actively organised events for its members to discuss and promote best practice in terms of Responsible Gaming. The European Association for the Study of Gambling's 8th Annual Conference in September 2010 was attended by academics, policy makers and industry representatives and much of its themes and discussions centred on responsible gaming.

To this end, he set up ACER (Afro- Caribbean Education Resource) and co-founded the Black Cultural Archives. Family and education Len Garrison was born in St Thomas, Jamaica. His father, Ernest Samuel Garrison ‚Äî a cabinet maker born in Hopewell, Hanover ‚Äî and mother, Albertha Adassa Garrison, a school teacher born in Somerset, St Andrew, migrated to Britain in 1952 and 1953 respectively, and Len joined them there in west London in 1954 shortly before the birth of the first of his British siblings, sister Janet in May 1954. This was followed by the birth of his brothers, Owen (b. July 1955), Albert (b. October 1957) and Michael (b. November 1959).Mike Phillips, \\"Obituary: Len Garrison - Recording the history of black Britons for future generations\\", The Guardian, 28 February 2003. Garrison's early training was as a photographer, a passion from his childhood, which he studied at King's College London. He went on to become a specialist medical photographer at Guy's Hospital, as well as an active freelance photographer for the West Indian Gazette. His educationalist training began in 1971 when he attended Ruskin College, gaining a diploma in development studies. He later gained a BA at the University of Sussex in African history and Caribbean history, then went on to an MA in local history from Leicester University.\\"Len Garrison\\", 100 Great Black Britons. In 1987, he married his wife Marie, and they had a son, Tunde, born 10 December 1990. Publications Following his degree from Sussex, Garrison was invited to represent Britain at FESTAC - the Festival of Arts and Culture in Nigeria in 1977 (Festac Town), where his presentation was based on his dissertation on the Rastafarian movement that he had written while at Ruskin College. Ansel Wong's brief biography of Garrison in the opening of Garrison's 1965 book of poetry, Beyond Babylon, reveals that the dissertation was subsequently developed into a book, now in its second reprint ‚Äî Black Youth Rastafarianisim and Identity Crisis in Britain. Work and legacy =ACER= In his work on Rastafari and identity Garrison drew the conclusion that the British education system was failing black children as it denied the reality or existence of black history or culture. He believed that \\"Given the right opportunity [Black children] can become an asset to [British] society.\\" He argued that what was required was an educational resource that was multi-cultural, recognising and acknowledging black history. In order to do this ACER (Afro-Caribbean Education Resource) was set up. Its aim was to give black children a sense of identity and belonging to be proud of, and one that could be traced back to their African roots. It would make them black British citizens, with a part to play in multi-cultural Britain. Garrison saw ACER as an archive of Black history from which educational material could be developed for school children of all ages and abilities. He campaigned for two years with the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) and others for the funding and resources until 1977, when the ACER project was launched with Garrison as director. ACER's black history educational packs, first introduced at Dick Sheppard School in Brixton, went on to be used all over the country. Of the many schemes that ACER organised, the most successful was the Young Penmanship awards for creative writing about their reality and experience as Black young people in Britain. The award helped launch the careers of many black professionals, including the playwright Michael McMillan, novelist and barrister Nicola Williams, the music critic Clive Davis and Dr Michael Beckles. When ILEA was dismantled in 1988 ACER closed due to lack of funding. ACER's legacy can be seen today in black history being part of the mainstream British educational curriculum and its work has inspired the Dutch to develop similar multi-cultural learning. In the late 1980s, Garrison took the ACER idea to Nottingham, where he became director of the ACFF (African Caribbean Family and Friends) Centre. There he was instrumental in establishing EMACA ‚Äî East Midlands African Caribbean Arts ‚Äî an organisation that promotes positive cultural practice in the arts, particularly the black visual arts. He also developed local history work around George Africanus, Nottingham's first black entrepreneur. =Black Cultural Archives= Garrison believed that \\"collecting and structuring the fragmented evidence of the Black past in Britain as well as in the Caribbean and Africa is a monumental task, but it is a major agenda item in [the] last decade of the 20th century [to create a] better basis for achieving a fully multicultural British society\\" To this end he co-founded the Black Cultural Archives (BCA) in 1981 and became a trustee. The BCA's mission is to ensure that black history is properly recorded and available to all, and to correct \\"the historical omission\\" of black people of African descent from Britain's official history by ensuring that their true contributions are documented and celebrated. Doing so became the basis for achieving the fully multicultural British society that was Garrison‚Äôs vision. The BCA won funding of ¬£5million in 2010, and having been based in Kennington, moved back to Brixton to become the UK's first national black heritage centre. At the launch of the new BCA in Windrush Square on 24 July 2014, a bust of Garrison was unveiled.Tom Dickens, \\"Moving celebration marks long journey to the Black Cultural Archives launch in Brixton\\", Brixton Blog, 24 July 2014.Hannah Ellis-Petersen, \\"Black Cultural Archives unveils new centre in Brixton\\", The Guardian, 29 July 2014. =Brixton Pound= Garrison appears on one of the banknotes of Brixton's independent currency, the Brixton Pound.

History Established in early 1941 as a coastal patrol light bomber squadron, assigned to the Northwest Air District (later Second Air Force). Deployed to Louisiana to fly antisubmarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico after the Pearl Harbor Attack, equipped with B-18 Bolos. Trained with B-25 Mitchells in Louisiana under Third Air Force, then after several months in Louisiana, moved to Central California and received new B-25s from North American, being trained as a medium bombardment squadron. Was deployed to Egypt in July 1942, flying via the South Atlantic Transport Route, then across Central Africa to Eritrea, then north to Cairo arriving at RAF Deversoir in early August. Assigned to the new Ninth Air Force in November while engaging in tactical bombardment and strafing missions against enemy armor and troop concentrations; also attacked enemy bases and columns in the rear area behind the lines in western Egypt and Libya. Moved west supporting the British Eighth Army's advance in the Western Desert Campaign into Tunisia.

Dr. William Petit was severely injured. His wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit and his two daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit, were all murdered. Upon entering the Petits' home, Komisarjevsky beat Dr. Petit with a baseball bat. He and Hayes then restrained Dr. Petit in the basement. Hawke-Petit and her daughters were also restrained. Hayes later kidnapped Hawke-Petit and forced her to withdraw money at a bank. After returning to the home, he raped her and strangled her to death. Michaela was raped by Komisarjevsky. Hayes and Komisarjevsky then decided to burn down the house to destroy evidence. While Hayley and Michaela were tied to their beds, the two men doused them and the house with gasoline. They then set the house on fire, leaving the daughters to die of smoke inhalation. The case garnered a significant amount of attention in Connecticut, with the Hartford Courant citing it as \\"possibly the most widely publicized crime in the state's history\\".Kauffman, Matthew. \\"Fair Trial Seen Likely For Other Cheshire Defendant.\\" Hartford Courant. November 9, 2010. Retrieved on November 11, 2010. The murders received national and international attention as well, and had a significant impact on Connecticut's death penalty, ultimately delaying its abolition. Hayes was convicted of the murders and sentenced to death in 2010. Komisarjevsky was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to death in 2012. In August 2015, the Connecticut Supreme Court, in defiance of the General Assembly which had abolished the death penalty only for future cases, ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional and commuted all death sentences to life imprisonment, even if that sentencing took place prior to the date that the death penalty was abolished. Background In the evening of Sunday, July 22, 2007, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her 11-year-old daughter, Michaela Petit, went to a local Stop & Shop grocery store in Cheshire, Connecticut. They picked up food for a family dinner Michaela planned to prepare. During their trip to the grocery store, they attracted the attention of Joshua Komisarjevsky, who followed them home. Prosecutors argued at the trial that Komisarjevsky was motivated by money and his interest in Michaela, who he later sexually assaulted. Shortly afterwards, Steven Hayes sent a text message to Komisarjevsky that read, \\"I'm chomping at the bit to get started. Need a margarita soon.\\" Hayes then texted, \\"We still on?\\" Komisarjevsky replied, \\"Yes.\\" Hayes's next text asked, \\"Soon?\\", to which Komisarjevsky replied: \\"I'm putting the kid to bed hold your horses\\". Hayes replied: \\"Dude, the horses want to get loose. LOL.\\" Home invasion According to Hayes's confession, he and Komisarjevsky had planned to rob the Petit house under the cover of darkness, leaving the family bound but otherwise unharmed. Both men attributed the grisly outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival in the early hours of July 23, they found Dr. Petit asleep on a couch in the sun room. Komisarjevsky entered the basement through an unlocked door. Leaning on the basement stairs was a baseball bat. Komisarjevsky then entered the sun room and used the bat to strike Dr. Petit four or five times. He and Hayes bound his wrists and ankles with plastic zip ties and rope. Dr. Petit remembers one perpetrator telling the other, ‚ÄúIf he moves, put two bullets in him.‚Äù The children and their mother were then bound in their respective rooms. Hayes and Komisarjevsky tied them by their wrists and ankles to their bedposts and placed pillowcases over their heads. After restraining the victims, Komisarjevsky and Hayes ransacked the house for cash. They then took Dr. Petit to the basement where they tied him to a support pole. Hayes and Komisarjevsky continued ransacking the house for money but were not satisfied with what they found. They then found a check register with $40,000. They decided to steal $15,000. Surveillance video from a gas station shows Hayes purchasing $10 worth of gasoline in two cans that were taken from the Petit home. After returning to the house, he took Hawke-Petit to the bank. The prosecution later claimed that this was evidence of premeditated murder.Evidence too graphic for Dr. Petit NEWS 8 wthn.com, Annie Rourke, September 22, 2010 Hayes forced Hawke-Petit to withdraw $15,000 from her line of credit when the bank opened. Hawke-Petit informed the bank teller that men were holding her family hostage in their home and threatening to kill them all. Bank surveillance cameras captured the transaction. The bank manager called 9-1-1 and reported the situation to police while Hawke-Petit was still with the teller. The manager reported to the 9-1-1 dispatcher, in real-time, as Hawke-Petit left the bank. The manager told the dispatcher that Hawke-Petit had indicated that the home invaders were \\"being nice\\", and that she believed they only wanted money. The Cheshire police responded to the bank's report by assessing the situation and setting up a vehicle perimeter, without revealing their presence.Italiano, Laura. \\"Teller's urgent bid to save lives.\\" The New York Post. September 16, 2010. Retrieved on January 18, 2013. During this time, Hayes and Komisarjevsky aggravated the nature of their crimes. Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted 11-year-old Michaela, which he later confessed to when interrogated. Evidence that Komisarjevsky raped Michaela came from her autopsy, during which State Medical Examiner Dr. Wayne Carver found his semen in her body. Komisarjevsky photographed the assault and rape on his cell phone. In his interrogation, he claimed that he believed Michaela was 14 or 16. Forensic testing results showed that there was bleach on Michaela's clothes, indicating that Komisarjevsky may have tried to eliminate DNA evidence from the assault. According to Hayes' confession, Komisarjevsky provoked him into raping Hawke-Petit., Dr. Petit was able to hear the thumping and moaning sounds caused by the rape of his wife. He yelled up and heard one of the invaders say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs all gonna be over in a couple of minutes.‚Äù Dr. Petit then managed to escape. He later testified in court that he felt a \\"jolt of adrenaline\\" and a need to escape after being told this. \\"I thought, it's now or never because in my mind at that moment, I thought they were going to shoot all of us.\\" Hayes said in his confession that while he was raping Hawke-Petit on the living room floor, Komisarjevsky entered and announced that Dr. Petit had escaped. Hayes then strangled Hawke-Petit. He and Komisarjevsky doused her lifeless body and parts of the house, including the daughters' bedrooms, with gasoline. While tied to their beds, both daughters were doused with gasoline as well. Investigators would later find the accelerant on the Petit sister's beds and on the clothing they were wearing. Hayes and Komisarjevsky started a fire and fled the scene. Hayley and Michaela both died of smoke inhalation. Hayley managed to escape her restraints and run out of her bedroom and into the hallway where she collapsed and died. Her body was found at the top of the staircase. Third and fourth-degree burns on her feet indicate that she got very close to the fire around the time she died. The medical examiner who performed an autopsy on her could not determine if the burns occurred before or after her death. Michaela's body was found in her bedroom. She was still in her bed, her hands tied to it and her lower body hanging off of it. Like with her older sister, Michaela's burns may have occurred while she was still alive. Dr. Petit had been able to free himself of his restraints, exit the house, and crawl to a neighbor's yard for help. The neighbor initially did not recognize Dr. Petit due to the severity of his injuries. Meanwhile, Hayes and Komisarjevsky fled the scene in the Petit family car. They were immediately spotted by police surveillance, pursued, and arrested one block away after crashing into a police car. The home invasion had lasted seven hours. Both Hayes and Komisarjevsky confessed to the murders. Detectives testified that Hayes smelled of gasoline throughout his interrogation. Each assailant claimed that the other was the driving force and mastermind behind the home invasion. Komisarjevsky also blamed Dr. Petit for the murders. In Komisarjevsky's diary, which was later entered into evidence, he called Dr. Petit a \\"coward\\" and claimed that he could have saved his family if he wanted to. Victims Jennifer Hawke-Petit (born September 26, 1958) was a nurse and co-director of the health center at Cheshire Academy, a private boarding school in Cheshire.

After Hayley left for college, Michaela planned on taking over Hayley's Hope and renaming it \\"Michaela's Miracle.\\" Michaela often cooked for her family and had done so the evening before the murders. William Petit, the sole survivor of the home invasion, was an endocrinologist in Plainville. He was also the medical director of the Joslin Diabetes Center at Connecticut's Central Hospital. He survived when he escaped via a direct external exit from the basement despite his injuries. Dr. Petit has not returned to his medical practice since the murders, stating his desire to be active in the foundations set up to honor the memory of his family. He contemplated running for Congress as a Republican, but later decided against it. In the following election cycle, he successfully campaigned for the Connecticut General Assembly and now serves as a state representative. Perpetrators Steven J. Hayes (born May 30, 1963, in Homestead, Florida) was convicted as an adult for the first time in 1980 at age 16. He was paroled in 1982 but violated it seven weeks later. During the time between this incident and the Cheshire murders, Hayes was arrested nearly 30 times. He spent most of this time incarcerated. Hayes' last arrest before the Cheshire murders was in 2004 after he smashed a car window with a rock and stole a woman's purse. He was paroled in 2006 and was sent to the Silliman halfway house where he met Komisarjevsky. Hayes was found guilty on 16 of 17 counts related to the Cheshire murders on October 5, 2010. On November 8, 2010, the jury returned with a recommendation for him to be executed. He was formally sentenced to death by Superior Court Judge Jon C. Blue on December 2, 2010. Hayes was an inmate of the Connecticut Department of Correction. Subsequent to sentencing for the Petit murders, and up until August 16, 2016 (when he was transferred to a correctional facility in Pennsylvania as part of an interstate corrections compact), he was incarcerated in the Northern Correctional Institution,\\"Hayes, Steven Joseph .\\" Connecticut Department of Correction.

He was adopted by Benedict Komisarjevsky, the son of theatrical director Theodore Komisarjevsky and dancer Ernestine Stodelle, and his wife Jude (n√©e Motkya). In the early 1990s Komisarjevsky's sister accused him of sexually assaulting her. During the penalty phase of his trial, Komisarjevsky's father conceded that this was probably true. Komisarjevsky committed his first burglary when he was 14. In 2002 he was arrested for 18 home invasions. Komisarjevsky's defense attorney at the time says that Komisarjevsky told him about every burglary he committed in perfect detail. Komisarjevsky told his attorney that after robbing the houses, he would go to the rooms where the occupants were sleeping and listen to them breathe. He did this because he enjoyed the feeling of invading people‚Äôs homes and violating their security. Komisarjevsky was convicted of 12 counts of burglary in December 2002. He was sentenced to nine years in prison with six years of special parole. During sentencing, Judge James Bentivegna described him as a ‚Äúcalculated, cold-blooded predator.\\" Komisarjevsky was paroled in April 2007. Under Connecticut law, prosecutors were supposed to send the parole board a transcript of the sentencing proceeding. But the parole board that released Komisarjevsky never received the transcript and was not aware of all the details regarding his case. After being paroled, Komisarjevsky stayed at the Silliman halfway house where he met Hayes. Komisarjevsky remained incarcerated at the Walker Reception Center\\"Komisarjevsky, Joshua A .\\" Connecticut Department of Correction. Retrieved on November 10, 2010. in lieu of a $15 million bond until his conviction. His trial began on September 19, 2011, and on October 13, 2011, he was convicted on all 17 counts. On December 9, 2011, the jury recommended the death penalty. On January 27, 2012, Judge Jon Blue sentenced Komisarjevsky to death by lethal injection. His sentence also became an automatic life sentence when Connecticut abolished the death penalty in 2015. As of August 16, 2016, both Hayes and Komisarjevsky were transferred to separate prison facilities in Pennsylvania to serve their sentences. According to Connecticut state prison officials, the transfer was done as part of an interstate corrections compact due to reasons pertaining to \\"safety and security.\\" On August 18, after being transferred, Komisarjevsky attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself. Hayes is currently incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Greene, a supermax prison in Franklin Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania. Komisarjevsky is incarcerated in the State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Phoenix in Skippack Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Komisarjevsky is currently seeking a retrial. Prior to the first trial, his attorneys were not provided with recordings that he says could have helped his case, as they were destroyed due to a lightning strike in 2010. Backups were later found in 2014 at Cheshire Town Hall. Komisarjevsky's attorneys are arguing that the recordings could have helped bolster their argument that the police were inadequate in their response and therefore raise questions about the credibility of their testimony against him. Komisarjevsky also argues that he did not receive a fair trial due to the location it was held in. Judge Jon Blue denied a request by defense attorneys for the trial to be moved from New Haven to Stamford. Komisarjevsky claims that there was so much prejudice against him in New Haven that it was not possible for him to receive a fair trial there. In September 2019 it was revealed that the case would be heard by the Connecticut Supreme Court. The Court heard oral arguments in October 2019. In October 2019, Hayes claimed to be transgender and was to be undergoing hormone therapy in prison as part of his transition into a woman. Trials =Hayes' trial= Hayes' trial began on September 13, 2010. The jury was composed of seven women and five men. Hayes' defense attorneys argued that Komisarjevsky was the mastermind behind the home invasion and that he was responsible for escalating the violent nature of the crime at every critical point. Prosecutors argued that both perpetrators shared equal responsibility. Following the completion of the trial, the jury deliberated for about five hours and reached guilty verdicts on October 5. The sentencing phase of the trial began on October 18, 2010, during which the jurors had to decide if Hayes should be executed or imprisoned for life. Deliberations began on November 5. The first day of deliberations ended with the jury split over whether to recommend life in prison or death. The second day of these deliberations began on November 6. Defense attorney Thomas Ullman told the jury that a sentence of life in prison would be the harshest possible punishment for his client Hayes, because he was so tormented by his crimes and would be isolated in prison. \\"Life in prison without the possibility of release is the harshest penalty,\\" Ullman said. \\"It is a fate worse than death. If you want to end his misery, put him to death. If you want him to suffer and carry that burden forever, the guilt, shame, and humiliation, sentence him to life without the possibility of release.\\" On November 8, 2010, the jury returned with a recommendation that Hayes be executed. The jury recommended a death sentence on each of the six capital felony counts for which Hayes was convicted. In the sentencing phase, the jury had deliberated for about 17 hours, over the course of four days before reaching a decision. Jurors later reported that they deliberated over a long period of time so that they could weigh all the evidence properly. Hayes had attempted to negotiate a life sentence in a plea bargain but prosecutors chose to take the case to trial so that he could get the death penalty. After the verdict, his defense attorney stated: \\"Hayes smiled upon hearing the jury's recommendation of a death sentence.\\" He then added: \\"He is thrilled. That's what he's wanted all along.\\" During a press conference after the verdict, Dr. Petit stated: \\"We all know that God will be the final arbiter and I think the defendant faces far more serious punishments from the Lord than he can ever face from mankind.\\" He also spoke about his family, saying: \\"Michaela was an 11-year-old little girl tortured and killed in her own bedroom, surrounded by stuffed animals. Hayley had a great future. She was a strong and courageous person, and Jennifer helped so many kids.\\" For the first time in state history, the Connecticut state judicial branch offered post-traumatic stress assistance to jurors, who served for two months on the triple-murder trial, because they had been required to look at disturbing images and hear grisly testimony. On December 2, 2010, Hayes apologized for the pain and suffering he had caused the Petit family and added that: \\"Death for me will be a welcome relief and I hope it will bring some peace and comfort to those who I have hurt so much.\\" Judge Jon Blue formally imposed six death sentences, one for each of the capital charges; Blue then added a sentence of 106 years for other crimes Hayes committed during the home invasion, including kidnapping, burglary, and assault, before finishing with, \\"This is a terrible sentence, but is, in truth, a sentence you wrote for yourself in flames. May God have mercy on your soul.\\" The judge also gave Hayes an official execution date of May 27, 2011; Blue said that this date was a formality, because if Hayes appealed his case, his execution could be delayed for decades. His death sentence became a life sentence in August 2015 when the state abolished the death penalty. =Komisarjevsky's trial= Komisarjevsky's attorneys offered for him to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, but prosecutors took the case to trial in order to give him the death penalty. Komisarjevsky's trial began on September 19, 2011. His attorneys blamed Hayes for the murders, arguing that he was the criminal mastermind, while their client was a confused and easily led man who did not intend to kill anyone. Komisarjevsky was found guilty on October 13, 2011. On December 9, 2011, the jury recommended the death penalty. On January 27, 2012, Komisarjevsky was sentenced to death by lethal injection. During the hearing, Judge Blue said \\"This is a terrible sentence, but it's one you wrote for yourself with deeds of unimaginable horror and savagery.\\" Komisarjevsky made a statement during the sentencing hearing. He spoke about the shame, disappointment, and hurt he had caused, saying: \\"I will never find peace within. My life will be a continuation of the hurt I caused. The clock is now ticking and I owe a debt I cannot repay.\\" Though he acknowledged taking part in the crime, he insisted that he did not intend to kill anyone, saying: \\"Millions have judged me guilty of capital offenses I did not commit. I did not intend for those women to die. They were never supposed to lose their lives. I don't need twelve people to tell me what I'm guilty or not guilty of. None of them were there that morning. I know my responsibilities. I will bear them as I should. What I cannot do is claim responsibility for the actions of another.\\" He spoke about how the trial affected him, saying that he had become \\"quite comfortable in the face of hatred and bigotry\\" and said that the jury who recommended the death penalty for him \\"believed me so worthless even my very existence is deemed intolerable.\\" He also said that forgiveness was not his to have, and that he needed to forgive his worst enemy ‚Äì himself. During his victim impact statement, Dr. Petit described the crime as his personal holocaust and said \\"I have a difficult time sleeping and trusting anymore. I hope to continue to honor my family. I push forward in the hope that good will overcome evil.\\" Blue set July 20, 2012, as Komisarjevsky's execution date. As with Hayes, Komisarjevsky's death sentence was turned into a life sentence in August 2015. Subsequent developments in Connecticut capital punishment law The Cheshire home invasion murders had a significant impact on Connecticut‚Äôs laws regarding the death penalty and on the debate surrounding the topic. The case motivated proponents of Connecticut's death penalty and was cited as a reason that any repeal of the capital punishment in the state should not extend to those already on death row. The Hartford Courant listed the Cheshire murders and the subsequent death penalty repeal as some of the top stories that shaped the 2010s. ‚ÄúThe Cheshire home invasion murders and the subsequent repeal of the death penalty dominated the political and criminal justice landscapes in Connecticut for the first half of the decade.\\" The murders halted momentum to end the state's death penalty and ultimately delayed that abolition. In 2009, the Connecticut General Assembly sent legislation to abolish the state's death penalty to Governor M. Jodi Rell ostensibly to be signed into law. However, on June 5, 2009, Rell vetoed the bill instead and cited the Cheshire murders as an exemplary reason for doing so. On November 8, 2010, Rell issued the following statement regarding the jury's recommendation of a sentence of death for Hayes: On April 11, 2012, the Connecticut House of Representatives voted to repeal capital punishment for future cases (leaving past death sentences in place). The Connecticut Senate had already voted for the bill, and on April 25 Governor Dan Malloy signed the bill into law. In August 2015, the Connecticut Supreme Court declared all capital punishment inconsistent with the state constitution, effectively commuting the killers' sentences to life imprisonment. Aftermath The home invasion murders led to immediate calls for reforms to Connecticut‚Äôs criminal justice system. On July 31, 2007, Governor Rell ordered electronic monitoring of paroled burglars. On September 21 she banned parole for violent offenders and ordered a review of convicts already on parole. On July 31 Governor Rell called for a special session to consider tougher crime legislation and on August 31 she appointed a task force to examine Connecticut's criminal justice system. On January 25, 2008, Rell signed a 43-page bipartisan crime bill. Home invasion became a new class of crime which could result in a prison sentence of up to 25 years. The bill also paid for an upgrade to computer systems for law enforcement agencies. In 2007, John Carpenter, an employee of the Chase Collegiate School, ran the New York City Marathon, raising $8,554 for the \\"Miles for Michaela\\" campaign ‚Äì a scholarship benefit. The same year, Dr. Petit established the Michaela Rose Petit '14 Scholarship Fund of the Chase Collegiate School.\\"Endowed Funds at Chase Collegiate School .\\" Chase Collegiate School. Retrieved on November 9, 2010. He also established the Hayley's Hope & Michaela's Miracle MS Memorial Fund. On January 6, 2008, over 130,000 luminaria candles were lit in front of thousands of homes across Cheshire in \\"Cheshire Lights of Hope\\", a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis and a tribute to the Petit family. Founded by a local couple, Don and Jenifer Walsh, the event raised over $100,000 for Hayley's Hope and Michaela's Miracle Memorial funds. The murder, and its aftermath, were featured on the news magazine show Dateline NBC, in a segment titled \\"The Family on Sorghum Mill Drive\\", and on December 9, 2010, William Petit appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in a full- hour episode about the murders of his family and the work of the Petit Family Foundation.Harpo Productions, Inc. \\"In his first interview: Grieving husband and father Dr. William Petit on the unspeakable tragedy in Connecticut .\\" The Oprah Winfrey Show.

He met her when she was volunteering with the Petit Family Foundation. HBO broadcast a documentary by filmmaker David Heilbroner called The Cheshire Murders about the murders on July 22, 2013. On August 1, 2013, Petit told station WFSB that he and Paluf were expecting a child together. The baby, who was revealed to be a boy and named William Petit III, was born on November 23, 2013. In October 2013, Petit announced that he was considering running for Congress for the Republican Party after being approached by the National Republican Congressional Committee, who had asked him if he would be interested in running. Petit ultimately decided not to be a candidate. But in May 2016, Petit announced a bid for Connecticut's 22nd House District. Petit was elected, ousting 11-term Democratic Representative Betty Boukus, and currently serves as representative in the Connecticut House of Representatives. Dr. Petit condemned the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision to abolish the death penalty in August 2015, saying he believed the court had overstepped its powers and urging it to give greater consideration to the \\"emotional impact, particularly on victims and their loved ones\\" that death penalty cases generate. Hawke-Petit's sister Cindy Hawke Renn told NBC News that she was \\"disheartened\\" by the court's ruling.

The neder may consist of performing some act in the future (either once or regularly) or abstaining from a particular type of activity of the person's choice. The concept of the neder and the Jewish law related to it, is described at the beginning of the parashah of Matot. Laws A neder is a self-made oral declaration which makes an object prohibited to the person making the vow. The person thus creates a prohibition (issur) having the status of scriptural law (De'oraita), as the Torah states: :When the man pledges a vow (yidor neder) to Hashem, or swears an oath (hishavA\` shevuah), proscribing a prohibition (le'esor issar) on himself, he shall not desecrate his word; whatever has come out of his mouth he must do. From the phrase \\"he must do,\\" the rabbis deduced that there exists a positive commandment to fulfill what one said, as well as a negative prohibition not to desecrate one's word. The word \\"neder\\" is mentioned 33 times in the Pentateuch, 19 of which occur in the Book of Numbers.Holman Treasury of Key Bible Words: 200 Greek and 200 Hebrew Words Defined ... By Eugene E. Carpenter, Philip Wesley Comfort, page 200 Judaism views the power of speech as very strong.Treasure from Sinai By Nachman Zakon, page 182 It is speech that distinguishes humans from animals, and has the power to accomplish a lot for better or for worse. Due to the strength of a neder, and the fact that one must absolutely be fulfilled if made, many pious Jews engage in the practice of saying \\"b'li neder\\" after a statement that they will do something, meaning that their statement is not a binding neder in the event they cannot fulfill their pledge due to unforeseen circumstances.The Women's Torah Commentary: New Insights from Women Rabbis on the 54 ... edited by Elyse Goldstein, page 317 The most common way a neder is made is through verbal pronunciation. But according to some opinions, the performance of an act on three consecutive occasions is akin to a neder.Guidelines: three hundred of the most commonly asked questions about the Yomim Noraim By Elozor Barclay, Yitzchok Jaeger, page 23 =The distinction between neder and shevuah= The word neder is often translated into English and other languages as a \\"vow\\", while shevu'ah is often rendered as \\"oath\\", though no single English word exactly describes either.The Living Torah By Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Parshat Matot The neder may a promise of prohibition or deprivation (neder issar, e.g., \\"Let all beans be forbidden to me for thirty days\\"), or a dedication to the Temple (neder he·∏≥desh, e.g. \\"I pledge to bring a burnt- offering\\").Mishneh Torah Nedarim 1:1-2http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14738-vows 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia: VOWS The latter case forbids the object's benefit to the person making the neder, and obligates him to bring it to its new \\"owner.\\" Thus the thing common to any neder is that it applies to the object, not the person. When a specific object is pledged, the neder is also called a nedavah, dedication, which is the name in Deut. 12:17; an example is, \\"This [animal] shall be a burnt-offering.\\" In contrast, the type of shevu\`ah mentioned above (referred to by the Sages as shevu'at bitui, ◊©◊ë◊¢◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ï◊ô) (and distinct from \\"oath\\" in testimony and jurisprudence, also called shevu\`ah)Mishneh Torah, Shevu'ot 1:1 is a declaration wherein a person makes a statement obligating himself to perform a positive act or to refrain from doing something, either regarding past events or future ones. Lev. 5:4-10https://steinsaltz.org/daf/shevuot-19a-b-masechet-shevuot-begins-to- discuss-oaths/ A shevu\`ah is a requirement on the person, not on the object. An example is, \\"I will not eat any beans for thirty days.\\" Reasons for nedarim Jewish people traditionally have made nedarim for a variety of reasons (some of which are cited below, for added illustration). =Personal piety= Some nedarim are made out of closeness to God and one's personal dedication. The neder is a way of making a commitment to the Torah and mitzvot and the practice of religion.Vows in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East By Tony W. Cartledge, pages 27-28 For example, it is common for a tzaddik who is at a very high level of Torah practice to set new guidelines in his life. =Gratitude= Nedarim are sometimes made out of gratitude toward God for having been the beneficiary of some form of kindness from God's hand, such as a miracle. For example, one whose life has been saved from near-death might make a new neder as a commitment toward God. =Personal improvement= One who wishes to improve oneself might make a neder in order to change one's behavior for the better.Treasure from Sinai By Nachman Zakon, page 183 =In times of need= Some Jews in times of desperation have made nedarim in hopes that God will answer their prayers in exchange for making a commitment. Essentially, they are \\"bargaining\\" with God to have their needs met.Vows in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East By Tony W. Cartledge, pages 25-26 For example, a woman who is unable to have children might make a neder to give a certain amount of charity if she is blessed with children. =The Nazirite neder= A common type of neder is that of the Nazirite. A neder to be a Nazirite for a period of time or sometimes for life for either of the above- described reasons.Vows in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East By Tony W. Cartledge, pages 18-23 The Nazirite is required to refrain from consuming alcoholic beverages or grape products, cutting one's hair, or exposure to dead bodies, including one's closest relatives. Annulment (hatarat nedarim) Generally, a neder is so strong, that it cannot be broken, and doing so constitutes an aveira (sin). For this reason, it is better not to make a neder at all, than to make a neder and not to keep it.Holman Treasury of Key Bible Words: 200 Greek and 200 Hebrew Words Defined ... By Eugene E. Carpenter, Philip Wesley Comfort, page 200 But there are times when halakha permits a neder to be broken. A neder may be annulled by either a beit din (court of Jewish law, composed of at least three adult men), or singlehandedly by a Talmid chacham (Torah scholar). Either one must ask the individual whom originally made the neder why they now wish to have their neder annulled. =Nedarim by women= According to the Torah, a neder pronounced by a married woman or a female \\"still living in her father's house\\" can be \\"disallowed\\" by her husband or her father, respectively, if they so choose, but only on the day that they hear the vow.Numbers 30:4-6 Otherwise, the neder may not be broken. The neder of a widow or a divorcee is also binding once uttered. The fact that a neder by a woman can so easily be invalidated by a man has been criticized by some contemporary feminists, though others see it as a kindness in Judaism toward women. Under the latter view, in a marriage, it is a means of keeping marital partners in harmony by requiring women to discuss a neder with her husband before taking it on.The Women's Torah Commentary: New Insights from Women Rabbis on the 54 ... edited by Elyse Goldstein, page 318-20 =High Holidays= Traditionally, around the High Holidays, all nedarim are annulled in order to free all persons of the liability in the event they are not fulfilled. They first are annulled on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, and then by the recitation of Kol Nidre at the beginning of Yom Kippur.Guidelines: three hundred of the most commonly asked questions about the Yomim Noraim By Elozor Barclay, Yitzchok Jaeger, page 21 The common practice is for groups of people, such as family members or a minyan to ask for the annulment together. But one who is unable to do this can rely on the Kol Nidre of the community, which is recited on behalf of all Jews.Guidelines: three hundred of the most commonly asked questions about the Yomim Noraim By Elozor Barclay, Yitzchok Jaeger, page 22 Through the High Holiday annulment, the following types of nedarim can be annulled:Guidelines: three hundred of the most commonly asked questions about the Yomim Noraim By Elozor Barclay, Yitzchok Jaeger, page 23 *The fulfillment of a voluntary commandment *A practice beyond Torah commandments in which the plan was to fulfill the neder indefinitely *A practice that was performed on three consecutive occasions *A neder to give tzedaka All nedarim that are annulled must be those one cannot remember having made. If one can remember having made a neder, he must recite it to at least three adult men who are familiar with the laws of the specific type of neder.Guidelines: three hundred of the most commonly asked questions about the Yomim Noraim By Elozor Barclay, Yitzchok Jaeger, page 24 Procedure The High Holidays annulment has a customary text and procedure which goes as follows. First the individual asks for annulment of every vow or pledge or prohibition that he swore \\"while I was awake or dreaming\\", \\"whether they were matters relating to money, or to the body, or to the soul\\".... The tribunal responds by reciting three times, \\"May everything be permitted you, may everything be forgiven you, may everything be allowed you. There does not exist any vow, oath, ... or curse. But there does exist pardon, forgiveness, and atonement.\\" The individual then concludes with a brief statement: \\"I cancel from this time onward all vows and all oaths ... that I will accept upon myself, whether while awake or in a dream .... from this moment I preemptively regret them and declare of all of them they shall be utterly null and void....\\"Scherman, Nosson, et al., The Complete ArtScroll Machzor: Rosh Hashanah (Ashkenazic) (1985, Brooklyn, Mesorah Publ'g) pp. 2‚Äì5; Mahzor Rinat Yisroel: Rosh Hashana (Ashkenazic) (1979, Jerusalem) p. 13‚Äì14; Nulman, Macy, Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayers (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson) p. 302 s.v. \\"Shime'u na Rabbotai\\".

After being taken out of service in 2010, she sat in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada for two years. Decommissioning was fraught with problems and the ship eventually became a floating derelict in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2013. She is believed to have sunk. History Lyubov Orlova was named after the Russian film star Lyubov Orlova. The ship was built for the Far Eastern Shipping Company based at Vladivostok in the Soviet Union. She served as an expedition cruise ship, like her equally unlucky sister . Her hull was built to Finnish-Swedish ice class 1A, to withstand impacts with ice, and she often sailed in Antarctica and the Arctic. The ship was refurbished in 1999, and chartered by Marine Expeditions for cruises to the Antarctic Peninsula in 2000. She underwent extensive renovations in 2002 and was subsequently chartered by Quark Expeditions for the Antarctic and Cruise North Expeditions for the Arctic. Lyubov Orlova ran aground at Deception Island, Antarctica, on 27 November 2006. She was towed off by the Spanish Navy icebreaker Las Palmas and made her own way to Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. Loss =Decommissioning= Lyubov Orlova derelict dockside in St. John's, 2012 In September 2010, Lyubov Orlova was seized at St John's, Newfoundland, Canada due to debts of US$251,000 owed to the charterer, Cruise North Expeditions, from a cruise which was cancelled because of faults with the ship. In addition, the 51 crew members had not been paid in five months. The ship was impounded in Newfoundland and, in February 2012, was sold to Neptune International Shipping to be broken up. =Salvage and abandonment= The derelict vessel had been tied up in St. John's harbour for over two years and was being towed to the Dominican Republic to be scrapped. The tug Charlene Hunt, owned by American tug operator Hunt Marine, was contracted to tow the ship. The day after leaving the dock, the tow line parted. The crew of the tugboat tried to reconnect the line but was hampered by winds and waves. By 28 January 2013, Lyubov Orlova was drifting slowly eastward off the southeastern end of the Avalon Peninsula in Canada. The offshore supply vessel Atlantic Hawk, with a 157 tonne continuous bollard pull rating, under contract by Husky Energy, was tasked with regaining control of the drifting vessel, which was a risk to oil and gas operations in the region. On 1 February 2013, Transport Canada announced that on 31 January, Atlantic Hawk had successfully gained control of Lyubov Orlova. Once in international waters, Transport Canada decided to cut her loose. \\"The Lyubov Orlova no longer poses a threat to the safety of offshore oil installations, their personnel or the marine environment. The vessel has drifted into international waters and given current patterns and predominant winds, it is very unlikely that the vessel will re-enter waters under Canadian jurisdiction,\\" the department said in a statement, giving safety concerns as their reason for not pursuing a salvage operation. The ship was located on 4 February, approximately 250 nautical miles east of St. John's, (approximately 50 nautical miles outside Canada's territorial waters) and drifting in a northeasterly direction. She could have ended up almost anywhere from the Norwegian Arctic to western Africa, or stuck in the middle of the North Atlantic Gyre. Transport Canada reiterated that the owner of the vessel remained responsible for her movements, and measures had been taken to monitor the position of the drifting ship. On 23 February, according to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Lyubov Orlova was spotted at roughly 1,300 nautical miles from the Irish coast. A week later, the ship was the subject of news reports in Ireland and Iceland, and a caution to smaller vessels was issued. On 1 March, Irish media reported that a signal from the vessel's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) was received from 700 nautical miles off the Kerry coast, still in international waters. An EPIRB starts transmitting only when the device is exposed to water, leading experts to speculate that the ship may have sunk. The Irish Air Corps was expected to continue to monitor the region. A review published in October 2013 cites the receipt of two EPIRB distress signals from Lyubov Orlova in mid-ocean, one on 23 February and another on 12 March.

The rumours were subsequently debunked. In November 2017, the British tabloid the Daily Star speculated that wreckage buried in sand on the beach at Coronado, California might be the missing MV Lyubov Orlova, but the Coronado wreck is the .

He was among the commanders of the army of Vicente Guerrero and Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos. And was a trusted man of Vicente Guerrero and was his sub-General. Originating from the Rancho de La Alhaja, in the current municipality of La Uni√≥n. He attended many war actions under the command of Morelos and Guerrero. He was head of the escort of Generalissimo Morelos called the 50 pairs. The main battle action where he stood out was that of the Treasury of Tamo, in Michoac√°n on September 15, 1818, in which the opposing forces numbered four times greater, they were totally destroyed. On the death of Don Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, on December 22, 1815, few insurgents remain fighting the royalists. The majority were pardoned but Vicente Guerrero continued fighting in the mountains of the south, who in the hacienda of Tamo (of the State of Michoac√°n today), together with Don Isidro Montes de Oca and with few and poorly armed insurgents, inflicted a real defeat on the royalist Jos√© Gabriel de Armijo and they also got enough equipment to properly arm 1,800 soldiers of freedom who in the future will deserve the respect of Agust√≠n de Iturbide. He stood out for his courage in the siege of the Port of Acapulco in 1813, under the orders of General Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n. As well as in the Cuautla Site. He was present in the historical deed called Acatempan's embrace, between Iturbide and Vicente Guerrero. Near the end of the war he reached the rank of captain general. After the end of the Mexican war of independence, he obtained some positions in the government of the republic; standing out as senator of the State of Sonora. Later retiring of the public life and taking refuge in the town of Petatl√°n, Guerrero; where he dedicated himself to the administration of his property, as well as to the activities of cattle raising and agriculture. He spent his last days of life in that place, his remains are in the parish of Petatl√°n in whose town he died at the age of 58. At the death of Vicente Guerrero, Juan √Ålvarez was the political heir. √Ålvarez began to direct the followers of President Vicente Guerrero sacrificed in 1831. Other minor caciques and military leaders, including General Isidro Montes de Oca, joined around √Ålvarez. According to Ricardo Pinzon, two Filipino soldiers ‚Äî Francisco Mongoy and Isidoro Montes de Oca ‚Äî were so distinguished in battle that they are regarded as folk heroes in Mexico. General Vicente Guerrero later became the first president of Mexico of African descent. Around the 1930s, the municipality La Uni√≥n Guerrero adopted its current name, La Uni√≥n de Isidoro Montes de Oca, in honor of the insurgent captain. His remains rest in the municipal pantheon of Petatl√°n, Guerrero. References * Delgado de Cant√∫, Gloria M. (2006). Historia de M√©xico. M√©xico, D.

It commemorates the 30th anniversary of the original Audi Quattro and the Audi quattro four wheel drive system. Based on the Audi RS5, it features a modified 2.5L five-cylinder TFSI engine and the sixth generation of quattro transmission. It had been reported that Audi were considering a limited production model (200‚Äì500 cars) based on the quattro concept, but the project was shelved in 2012. Elements of the concept's design language found their way into the production versions of both the third generation Audi TT and the second generation Audi R8. The concept's integrated infotainment and instrument cluster display was also realized in production Audi models as the virtual cockpit system, starting with the third generation Audi TT in 2014. Engine and transmission The car is powered by a turbocharged (TFSI) five cylinder 2.5 L engine producing . It has a six-speed manual gearbox and a new generation of the quattro permanent four wheel drive system. Body and chassis Based on the platform of the Audi RS5, with a wheelbase shortened by 150 mm, the styling is a reinterpretation of the short- wheelbase Audi Sport Quattro. The body is constructed in aluminium using Audi Space Frame technology, and additional carbon fibre components. The car's total weight is only 1,300 kilograms (2,866 lb), which makes for a power-to- weight ratio of 3,2 kilograms per horsepower (7.02 lb/hp). Interior The navigation system and infotainment, which is usually placed in the center of the dashboard, has been merged with the gauge cluster placed behind the steering wheel, making the controls of the car within arm's reach. The screen can display media and nav controls and the usual speedometer at the same time. The buttons on the infotainment system have been placed around the gauge screen and on the steering wheel for convenience. The main interior colors are beige and black, with silver trim here and there. There are two racing-style bucket seats in the car, with the rest of the rear interior space used for cargo.

Description and history Stratton Brook State Park is located in central Simsbury, on the south side of Farms Village Road (Connecticut Route 309). Its access drive leads to a parking area, with a beach and pond to its east and an open grassy area in between. At the southern end of the grassy area a paved path crosses a covered bridge leading to the picnic pavilion, which is set overlooking a second pond. The structure is built out of timber framing, and measures about . At one end is a large fieldstone chimney with sloping shoulders and a builtin bench. The structure is covered by a roof supported by heavy wooden trusses with rounded rafter ends. The floor of the shelter is flagstone. The shelter was built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and is one of many CCC structures recognized in a Connecticut-wide thematic resources study. It was built beside Massacoe Pond, created by a dam built by the CCC in 1933. That dam was later replaced by the present concrete dam.

Prairie State Energy Campus (PSEC) features low levels of regulated emissions compared to other coal-fired power stations, capturing sulfur from high-sulfur coal mined nearby instead of transporting low-sulfur coal from elsewhere. Ken Bone, a power plant worker who asked a question during a 2016 Presidential debate, is employed at Prairie State. He is a Control Room Operator.  Project  Proposed and led by Peabody Energy Corporation, the project is jointly owned by public electric utilities with Peabody initially retaining 5% ownership. It is operated by Prairie State Generating Company, LLC. The first 800 MW generator went online in June and the second in November, 2012. The project's Lively Grove underground mine is expected to produce 6 million tons of high sulfur coal per year. PSEC stated it will be \\"among the cleanest major coal-fueled plants in the nation\\" through use of pollution mitigation technology, producing as low as one-fifth the levels of regulated pollutants as typical U.S. coal-fired plants. Noting that projected emissions nevertheless include 25,000 tons of soot and smog-forming pollutants yearly, the Sierra Club and other organizations unsuccessfully sued to stop the EPA granting an air permit. According to the Chicago Tribune, PSEC will be the \\"largest source of carbon dioxide built in the United States in a quarter-century.\\" The company projects a 15% reduction in carbon dioxide () pollution compared with other coal-fired power plants based on its use of efficient supercritical steam generators and no emissions from transporting coal. Judging that regulatory limits on carbon emissions are not likely in the near future, Peabody chose not to employ a more expensive integrated gasification combined cycle design that could more easily be retrofitted with carbon capture technology. The Environmental Protection Agency first proposed limits in March 2012. The limit of 1000 lbs emissions per megawatt-hour electricity would require future coal-powered generating stations to capture approximately half of their output. The limit would not apply to existing and under-construction generating stations, including PSEC.  Costs  PSEC started delivering electricity in 2012 at prices well above market rates. Some of its investors resell the energy at a loss, some raise consumer rates, and two backed out of the project. PSEC's original $2 billion estimated cost attracted municipal electric utilities to invest and to sign 28 year contracts. However, as of early 2010 the estimated cost had increased to $4.4 billion, requiring investors to borrow more money and raising the projected cost of electricity to undesirable levels. Peabody in response capped construction costs at \\"approximately $4 billion\\" excluding some costs such as coal development and transmission lines. In January 2013, with many municipalities adversely impacted by the high prices, the SEC subpoenaed information from Peabody. In a bid to exit its share of the Prairie State project, the City of Hermann, MO filed a lawsuit in March, 2015 against the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission and the Missouri Public Energy Pool, claiming that its share of $1.5 billion in debt issued to support Prairie State imposed an unconstitutionally high level of debt on the city. Peabody divested its 5.06% stake in the project in 2016, accepting $57 million for its original investment of nearly $250 million. The buyer was Wabash Valley Power Association, a Midwest cooperative.

The MƒÅori name Puke-haukea has been attributed to the creek; however, as puke means a hill, not a watercourse, this is likely to be a confusion. The creek has its origins on the southern slopes of Kapukataumahaka Mount Cargill about 1 kilometre southwest of the summit, and flows south, passing through the popular recreation reserve of Bethunes Gully before reaching Dunedin's suburban area at Normanby. It continues south-southwest, its thalweg running through North East Valley, passing through Chingford Park and along the foot of the Valley's Quarry Gardens before reaching the coastal plain of the Leith at The Gardens Corner. From here, it flows into Dunedin Botanic Gardens where it joins ≈åwheo, the Water of Leith. Several measures are underway to widen the channel of the creek at various points, in an attempt to provide more protection against floods. The creek has flooded on numerous occasions, most significantly in the Leith Flood of 1929 and in 1955, when it led to the inundation of many properties in North East Valley. Protection works have been built over the years, most notably realignment and walling of the channel in the lower part of North East Valley after the 1929 flood and further work on the same area in 1965. Further walling of the channel in the central part of North East Valley was undertaken during the 1970s.

The common name is mountain marara or Dorrigo southern marara. The species name rubifolia is from the Latin, meaning \\"bramble\\". The leaves resemble the blackberry. The genus is named after the Russian botanist E. Vesselowsky.  Habitat  Growing over creeks in cool rainforest areas. Often associated with the Antarctic Beech. From Cunnawarra National Park near Armidale, New South Wales to the upper Clarence River further to the north.  Description  The mountain marara is a bush or small tree to 8 metres tall, and 25 cm in diameter. The bark is thin and fairly smooth, dark brown in colour. With reddish brown bumps in vertical lines. Small branches are thin, green towards the ends with soft hairs. Leaf stipules are between 10 and 15 mm long, ovate and hairy. There are oil glands present at the base of the leaf stipules. = Leaves = The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stem, in groups of threes or fives. The terminal, or largest of the leaves grows to 4 to 12 cm long, 2 to 4 cm wide. The lateral leaves are 3 to 7 cm long, 1.5 to 2.5 cm wide. The smallest basal leaves are 0.5 to 2.0 cm long, 0.5 to 1.7 cm wide. The leaflets at the base are smaller than those at the top of the leaf formation. The leaflets are serrated and have a pronounced tip. = Flowers and fruit = Flowers form from October to December on racemes. The top of the anther is not rounded as with Vesselowskya venusta. Prickles form on the small white anthers. Sepals are hairless on the outside surface. Fruit matures from March to August, being a pale brown capsule. As the seeds are small, they require a light covering, and seeds should not be buried too deeply in the seed raising mixture.

In his final year as a player, Frank trained as a teacher in sport and religion. He was inspired by Arrigo Sacchi's A.C.Milan and introduced the 4-4-2 system to Germany at a time when German teams played with a sweeper. Inspired by how Sacchi had got his team to press, marking space rather than individual players, Frank introduced this advanced tactical thinking into German football. He is credited with inspiring a renaissance in the Bundesliga which has inspired a new generation of managers such as J√ºrgen Klopp and Joachim L√∂w. Frank died in Mainz, aged 62.

Andriette was the Art Director for the LGBT periodical Baltimore Outloud, and was previously the Features Editor of The Guide, a gay travel and entertainment magazine published in Boston. As of 1996, he was the spokesman of the North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). In an interview in The Boston Phoenix in 1996, Andriette said, \\"I realized I was gay when I was 12.\\" He joined NAMBLA when he was 15 years old, and by the age of 17 he was a member of the Steering Committee. For six years he was the editor of the NAMBLA Bulletin. He expressed differences with some earlier NAMBLA directors' views regarding legalization of what is now considered to be statutory rape, finding room for compromise with government and societal concerns. He expressed frustration that the LGBT rights movement had ostracized NAMBLA, because he regarded the moral condemnation of pedophiles as a \\"reactionary ideology which the gay movement has happily adopted to burnish its own particular identity category.\\" During the 1993 International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) controversy, he defended NAMBLA's membership in ILGA, and to a greater extent NAMBLA's place in the gay rights movement, by claiming that \\"'the main tradition' of homosexuality\\" is consistent with supporting the abolition of laws prohibiting statutory rape. He appeared in the 1994 documentary about NAMBLA, Chicken Hawk: Men Who Love Boys, in which described how his work with NAMBLA provided an outlet for his sexual attraction to prepubescent young boys below the age of consent.

In July 2010, The Weingart Center Garden Project opened as the first green space in Skid Row. In 2004, the Weingart Center, along with the Ahmanson Foundation and the Annenberg Foundation founded the Skid Row Homeless Healthcare Initiative (SRHHI). SRHHI had 26 member organizations and hospitals, and ceased operation in 2008. The \\"skid row homeless health care initiative\\" link no longer exists, however, here is some information on how other foundations interested in helping the homeless community have come together to improve the health of skid row homeless residents. Providing healthcare to homeless people can be challenging given insurance issues, often no primary care provider, or the nature of their residence or lack thereof because care comes in bits from different sources. When services are disjointed there is no collaboration and integration of care. The treatments the homeless patients receive are not coordinated and the patient suffers. To provide adequate and comprehensive care to the homeless that would avoid confusion some organizations have come together to integrate health services for the homeless. It is possible that ‚Äòskid row homeless health care initiative‚Äô as noted in the above article was intended to make such a move towards organizing health care services for the homeless community. For example, the John Wesley Community Health (JWCH) Institute in collaboration with the Los Angeles County Department of Health services (DHS) run the center for community health at the Weingart. The Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County has recently partnered with The Children‚Äôs Clinic and the Venice Family Clinic to build sustainable clinics that would provide healthcare to the homeless in the county.

Related activities such as solicitation, procuring and being involved in the running of a brothel are illegal. A World Bank study estimated there were about 11,000 prostitutes in Namibia. Human trafficking, child prostitution and HIV are problems in the country. Overview Prostitution takes place all over the country, particularly in border areas, transport corridors, Walvis Bay and the capital Windhoek. Most prostitutes are Namibian, but there are also a significant number from Zambia, Botswana and Angola. Most women work independently and few have pimps. Most prostitutes in Namibia meet their clients either on the street or in bars. Bars often have a room on the premises for the prostitutes to use, and brothels usually have a bar, so the line between a bar and a brothel is often blurred. Some, more up-market, sex workers are contacted by cell phone or the Internet and work in high-end clubs and hotels. Many clients are reluctant to use condoms, and offer to pay more for unprotected sex. Condoms may be difficult to obtain at times, and can be confiscated by police and used as evidence of prostitution. Sex workers and NGOs report abuse and violence against them by clients and police. Extortion and forced sex by the police is also reported. Child prostitution is a problem, particularly in Walvis Bay and Windhoek. History =German rule= In 1899, regulations around brothels using white prostitutes were drawn up in Swakopmund. This allowed the authorities to monitor the sexual health of the prostitutes and was designed to control the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Colonial authorities believed unregulated African prostitutes were the main source of STIs. Other towns subsequently introduced similar regulations, including Okahandja, Karibib, Windhoek, Keetmanshoop, Luderitz, Tsumeb and Seeheim. The use of white prostitutes was encouraged to try to prevent relationships between white men and African women. There is evidence that some of the white prostitutes had been trafficked into the country. After the Herero Wars, the German military set up a brothel in Windhoek for their troops. Although some indigenous women volunteered to work in the brothel, others were forced to work there. Although white men seeing African prostitutes was discouraged, it was tolerated throughout this era. =South African Rule= Prostitution was not made illegal, but the Undesirables Removal Proclamation (1920) was used to expel most of the white prostitutes and brothel keepers back to Germany. Also introduced in 1920 was the Police Offences Proclamation, which criminalised loitering and solicitation for the purpose of prostitution. There were concerns about child prostitution, and in 1921 the Girls' and Mentally Defective Women's Protection Proclamation was introduced which set the age of consent at 16. Prostitution was blamed by the authorities for African women migration to the cities from rural areas. A new regulation was introduced in 1938 requiring all \\"native females\\" in Windhoek between 18 and 60, unless legally married and living with their husbands, to undergo a medical examination every 6 months. After violent protests in March 1939 the regulation was withdrawn. Legal situation The Combating of Immoral Practices Act (Act 21 of 1980) is the main piece of legislation controlling prostitution in Namibia. The main provisions are the prohibiting of mainly third party involvement: * to solicit in a public street or place * to exhibit oneself in an indecent dress or manner in public view * to commit ‚Äúany immoral act‚Äù with another person in public (but not in private) * to keep a brothel * to ‚Äúprocure‚Äù any female to have unlawful carnal intercourse with another person, to become a prostitute, or to ‚Äúbecome an inmate of a brothel‚Äù * to entice a female to a brothel for the purpose of prostitution * to knowingly live wholly or in part on the earnings of prostitution * to assist in bringing about ‚Äúthe commission by any person of any immoral act with another person‚Äù * to detain a female against her will in a brothel Windhoek has Municipal Street and Traffic Regulations which prohibit loitering and soliciting. In case law it has been established that a prostitute working on her own in a house is not keeping a brothel, and that living on the earnings of prostitution does not apply to the prostitute themselves. Public order offences are also used against sex workers. =Legalisation discussion= A number of prominent groups have called for the legalization or decriminalization of prostitution. In 2008, the Legal Assistance Centre, a Windhoek-based non-profit human rights organisation, called for the decriminalization of prostitution as a means of cutting the country's high HIV-AIDS rate as well as a means for maintaining the human rights of the prostitute themselves. Rights not Rescue, a sex workers organisation is amongst those calling for decriminalisation. Many groups in Namibia actively oppose legalization and instead focus on providing skills to former sex workers. Some groups approach the issue from a religious perspective, arguing that Namibia's population is overwhelmingly Christian and therefore should not accept what they consider an immoral profession. Discussions in Parliament are usually controversial. An outspoken proponent of legalisation is Kazenambo Kazenambo, until 2015 Minister of Youth. HIV HIV/AIDS in Namibia is a critical public health issue. The prevalence of HIV in Namibia is among the highest in the world. Since 1996, HIV has been the leading cause of death in the country. National Demographic Health Survey, 2006 Sex workers are a high risk group. Some sources put the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers as high as 70%. Reluctance to use condoms, lack of sexual health education and limited access to healthcare are cited as contributory factors. Sex trafficking Namibia is a source and destination country for children, and to a lesser extent women, subjected to sex trafficking. Namibian children are subjected to sex trafficking in Windhoek and Walvis Bay. A 2015 media report alleged foreign sex tourists from southern Africa and Europe exploit child sex trafficking victims. In 2014, an NGO reported persons in prostitution, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, were taken aboard foreign vessels off the Namibian coast. Children from less affluent neighbouring countries may be subjected to sex trafficking. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Namibia as a Tier 2 country.

Part of the third wave of coffee movement, Caff√® Vita has been named one of the top ten places \\"to get the best coffee in America.\\" Caff√® Vita was founded in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood in 1995 by Mike McConnell. McConnell was an early proponent for developing direct relationships with coffee farmers, and bypassing the fair trade of coffee, pioneering the Farm Direct movement. Locations Caff√® Vita now operates 13 cafes throughout Seattle, Portland, New York, and Los Angeles. Caffe Vita coffee is always fresh, imported directly from the farm, and roasted on-site in Seattle, Brooklyn, and Portland. Caff√® Vita's location at 1005 East Pike Street, Seattle, houses their flagship cafe, their roasteria, and company offices. The company operates eight other cafes around Seattle, and a roasteria in Portland. In March 2012 they opened a cafe in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In the Spring of 2013 Caff√® Vita opened a location on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. In 2015, Caff√® Vita expanded its New York presence with the opening of a roasteria and cafe in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Caff√® Vita also supplies coffee to cafes, restaurants, and hotels who value farm direct, organic, specialty coffee. Community service In 2009, Caff√® Vita partnered with Portland's p:ear, a homeless youth mentoring program, to create the p:ear Barista School. Caff√® Vita provides equipment, coffee beans, milk, and training that allow the school to take homeless youth through an 8-week program that give them the necessary skills and experience to get a job as a barista. Also in 2009, Caff√® Vita underwrote and organized \\"GIVE Seattle\\": a 36-track compilation record, featuring artists such as Ben Gibbard and Fleet Foxes to benefit four local food banks and Arts Corps. Caff√® Vita currently supports FareStart's youth barista training program, which trains homeless youth and provides barista jobs at their coffee stands in T-Mobile Field. They also sponsor FareStart's annual Guest Chef Night and Volunteer Server Night, which annually bring together Seattle chefs and winemakers to raise money for FareStart. Every year, Caff√® Vita hosts a holiday fundraising drive for Jubilee Women's Center in all Caffe Vita cafes, with donations matched dollar for dollar.  Sustainability  Caffe Vita owner Mike McConnell is a pioneer Farm Direct movement, meticulously sourcing the best coffee available while developing long-term, mutually fruitful relationships with coffee growers in more than 11 countries. Caff√® Vita serves many Organic, Farm Direct, and Rainforest Alliance Certified coffees. In 2009, Caff√® Vita starting working with Woodland Park Zoo's Tree Kangaroo Project to develop the first-ever coffee from the YUS region made commercially available in the U.S. purchased directly from the growers at a fair price. Papua New Guinea Yopno Uruwa Som coffee, which protects the endangered Tree Kangaroo, is sold at all Seattle Caffe Vita locations and at Woodland Park Zoo ZooStores. In addition to coffee from PNG, Caff√® Vita also sells their Zoo Special Reserve, in which every bag of this coffee purchased online or in our cafes, a dollar is donated to the Woodland Park Zoo.  Partnerships  Caff√® Vita partners with Easy Street Records on their Easy Street Indo 30 coffee blend. Matt Vaughan was Caff√® Vita's first wholesale customer in 1995. Throughout the next 20 years they set a model for local and independent businesses, with support from each other and the community, allowing them to tantalize the ears and tongues of many with the best in music and coffee. In 2017, all Washington State Ferries began serving Caff√® Vita coffee. In 2019, Caffe Vita began barrel-aging their coffee in partnership with Batch 206 Distillery.

It was officially opened in 1998, and renovated between 2002 and 2009. The official motto is \\"Work in the best place to live\\". Location The WTC Montevideo is only 30 minutes away from Carrasco International Airport and 15 minutes away from the Port of Montevideo. It is next to Montevideo Shopping, in Buceo, the area of greatest growth in the city in recent years. Avenues of easy traffic flow which surround the Complex guarantee a quick access to it. The Complex has thus achieved true decentralization in the city, consolidating the trend set by its neighbor, Montevideo Shopping, over 20 years ago by moving the center of gravity of the city. Complex To date, WTC Montevideo is composed of three towers; two three-storey buildings called WTC Plaza and WTC Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. The WTC 1, is a 22 story, 17.000m2 tower inaugurated in 1998. That same year the WTC Avenue and WTC Auditorium were raised. This former is 2 stories tall, 5600 square meters in total, and the latter is attached to WTC 2. WTC 2 was inaugurated in 2002 and is identical to WTC 1. Combined, they are the second talles twin towers in Uruguay, only surpassed by the NuevoCentro Towers. 7 years later, in 2009, WTC 3, the WTC Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. WTC 3, located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo is 19 stories tall and has 27.000 square meters of total office space. WTC Plaza, is 2 stories tall and is home to several national and international food chains such as Burger King, Walrus, Bamboo, Gardenia Mvd, and La Claraboya Cafe. WTC 1, WTC Avenida and WTC 2 The Towers Square is meant to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances, cultural animation, a meeting spot as well as a tourist attraction. It connects the different buildings and towers from the WTC Complex and acts as the main access to it. At the centre of the Square sits a sculpture made by renowned Uruguayan artist Pablo Atchugarry. WTC IV Immediate View Completing the complex are World Trade Center 4, the tallest building in the complex, sitting at 120 metres above the ground, and WTC Free Zone, a 23 story tall building from the \\"WTC FZ\\" complex. WTC Free Zone 2's construction is set to complete in early 2020 and sit 60 meters (22 stories) above the ground. On July 5, 2015, a partially constructed bomb manufactured by a member of the Israeli embassy was discovered near the base of the WTC Montevideo.

He was first sent to NKVD special camp Nr. 6 in Frankfurt (Oder), then later moved to another camp in September 1945. In 1946, the administration of the Soviet occupation zone brought charges against Reckzeh, although the case was sent back to the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. Reckzeh had to wait until 1950 for the legal process to continue. By then he had spent time in camps at M√ºhlberg and Buchenwald. The GDR Minister of the Interior then brought charges against Rechzeh of acting as a spy who had caused harm to others due to their political opposition to Nazism.Zitat aus der Anklageschrift bei Leide On 3 June 1950 Reckzeh was sentenced at the district court of Chemnitz to fifteen years imprisonment.

At present it contains the single species Coprinites dominicana. The genus is solely known from the early Miocene, Burdigalian stage, Dominican amber deposits on the island of Hispaniola. Coprinites is one of only four known agarics fungus species known in the fossil record and the first of three to be described from Dominican amber. History and classification The genus is known only from the single holotype \\"AF-9-11\\", a single fruiting body, mushroom, specimen currently residing in the Poinar collections maintained by the University of California, Berkeley. The specimen was collected from the La Toca amber mine, northeast of Santiago de los Caballeros, in the Cordillera Septentrional area of the Dominican Republic. It was first studied by Dr. George Poinar of the UC, Berkeley and Dr. Rolf Singer from the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. Poinar and Singer published their 1990 type description in the journal Science. The generic epithet Coprinites is in reference to the genus similarity to the modern genus Coprinus. The specific epithet \\"dominicana\\" was coined by the authors in reference to the Dominican Republic where the fossil was recovered. When initially published Coprinites dominicana was the first species of agaric fungus to be described. Two more species Protomycena electra and Aureofungus yaniguaensis have since been described from fossils found in the amber mines of the Dominican Republic, while the fourth species Archaeomarasmius leggeti is from older Cretaceous age New Jersey Amber. With the 2007 publication of a fifth extinct agaric species, Palaeoagaracites antiquus the age for the order was pushed back to the Albian (approximately 100 Ma). Description The holotype of Coprinites is a lone fruiting body without any associated structures and a partly disarticulated stipe preserved in a piece of clear yellow amber approximately and weight . The pileus is in diameter and has a convex shape sporting a small central depression. The brownish-pink flesh is thin with a scaly-pectinate surface. The margin is striated and slightly flared. Coprinites sports fifteen nondeccurent lamellae, or gills, which reach the outer pileus and thirteen lamellulae, short gills which do not reach the edge, of varying lengths. The pileus is centered on the stipe, which is in diameter and incomplete, with part of the stipe base preserved in the amber next to the pileus. The light brown basidiospores, present on the hymenium associated with the fruiting body, are smooth and ellipsoidal to oblong. Each basidiospore is approximately 6 to 7 Œºm long and appear to possess a germ pore. Coprinites was originally placed in the family Coprinaceae based on the visible structures, or macromorphology of the fruiting body and the microscopic features preserved in the amber specimen. The combination of characters present did not match any modern genus of the mushroom order Agaricales leading Poinar and Singer to erect the genus Coprinites. The lack of autodeliquescence along with the mushrooms morphology lead David Hibbett, Michael Donoghue and David Grimaldi to question the placement of Coprinites. They noted the characters of the genus are similar to those of genus Leucocoprinus mushrooms. They suggested that Coprinites could be treated as either a member of Coprinaceae or Agaricaceae, to which Leucocoprinus belongs. With a number of molecular studies a large portion of the genera formerly placed in Coprinaceae, including Coprinus, have been moved into Agaricaceae. Thus supporting the suggestion of Hibbet, Donoghue, and Grimaldi.

It is known from two fruit bodies recovered from amber, one consisting of a complete cap with a broken stem, the other consisting of a fragment of a cap. The cap has a diameter ranging from , while the stem is thick. Spores were also recovered from the amber, and are broadly ellipsoid to egg-shaped, measuring roughly 7.3 by 4.7 Œºm. The species, which resembles the extant genera Marasmius and Marasmiellus, is inferred to have been saprobic on plant litter or other forest debris. The genus is solely known from the New Jersey amber deposits along the Atlantic coastal plain in New Jersey, United States, which date from the Turonian stage (about 90‚Äì94 Mya) of the Upper Cretaceous. Archaeomarasmius is one of only five known agaric fungus species known in the fossil record, and the only one to be described from New Jersey amber. History and classification The genus is known only from the two holotype fossils, a fruit body (or mushroom) and a fragment of a mushroom, both currently residing in the American Museum of Natural History. The specimens, collected in November 1994 from the area of East Brunswick, New Jersey, by G.R. Case, P.D. Borodin, and J.J. Leggett, were found as a single clear yellow amber nodule in diameter. The specimen was found above the South Amboy Fire Clay, part of the Raritan Formation, suggesting that it is Turonian in age (Upper Cretaceous, about 90 to 94 million years ago). Due to weathering, the amber specimen AMNH NJ-90 fractured into a number of chips along fractures and flow lines. The chips with the holotype specimens, AMNH NJ-90Y and AMNH NJ-90Z, were first studied by a group of researchers consisting of David Hibbett and Michael Donoghue from Harvard University with David Grimaldi of the AMNH. Hibbett and colleagues published their 1997 type description in the American Journal of Botany. The generic epithet Archaeomarasmius is a combination of the Greek archaeo- meaning \\"ancient\\" and \\"Marasmius\\", a modern genus which it resembles. The specific epithet \\"leggetti\\" was coined by the authors in honor of J.J. Leggett and company, who first discovered the amber nodule and donated it to the AMNH. When first reported, Archaeomarasmius leggetti was the second extinct species of agaric fungus to be described, and it is the only species to be known from the New Jersey amber. Three species, Aureofungus yaniguaensis, Coprinites dominicana and Protomycena electra, have been described from the Miocene Dominican amber found in the Dominican Republic. The extinct Agaricomycetes species Quatsinoporites cranhamii, found in marine calcareous concretions on Vancouver Island, Canada, and dating to about 130‚Äì125 Mya, is probably in the Hymenochaetales or the Polyporales. In 2007, another agaric was reported, Palaeoagaracites antiquus, found in Early Cretaceous Burmese amber (about 100 Mya). Description The holotypes of Archaeomarasmius consist of mushrooms and associated basidiospores. Specimen AMNH NJ-90Y is a nearly complete mushroom, broken off near the base of the stipe (stem). The pileus (cap) is up to in diameter and has a convex shape sporting an umbo (a broad raised central region). The mushroom is a medium- dark brown color with thin, minutely textured flesh and an incurved margin. The lamellae or gills are distantly spaced, with 12 gills extending fully from the cap edge to the stipe, and lack lamellulae (short gills which do not reach the stipe from the edge of the pileus). The pileus is centered on the stipe, which is long and is broken off above the base. The stipe lacks a veil and is smooth and cylindrical. The top of the pileus is exposed on a fracture plain, and to prevent oxidation, the area was coated in a fine layer of synthetic resin, which also resulted in slightly improved visibility of the mushroom. Specimen AMNH NJ-90Z is a small wedge-shaped fragment of pileus which was accidentally fractured during preparation for study, splitting it in half. Though the researchers had not intended to perform destructive analysis on the sample, this fracturing warranted the sacrifice of some parts of the specimen for structural and molecular study. Small pieces of the specimen were mounted directly on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) stubs and sputter coated with a gold/palladium alloy. The resulting images showed that little intact tissue remained, and only fragmented and crushed basidiospores were seen. Another sample of the specimen was mounted in spurr's resin (an embedding medium used in electron microscopy) and sectioned with a diamond knife; the resulting sections were examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The lack of discernible biological material from the mushroom seen in the SEM study was confirmed in the TEM analysis. A final section of the fossil was selected to attempt DNA sequencing. A small sample of the fossil was extracted at the AMNH and sent to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology for DNA amplification. None of the three selected extracts showed any results after the amplification was attempted. It is possible that the fractures and flowlines which split AMNH NJ-90Z during initial preparation had already penetrated into the fossil and destroyed the hermetic seal which would have been needed for preserving the organic matter of the mushroom. The basidiospores recovered with the fruiting body were examined during the SEM study. The spores showed considerable damage from both the fossilization process and the subsequent weathering and specimen collection. They also displayed distinct halos in the amber, possibly from gas or liquid leaching out, or a reaction in the spores that prevented the resin from turning to amber. Even so, enough remained to make some observations about spore morphology. The basidiospores are broadly elliptic to oval, measuring approximately 7.3 by 4.7 Œºm, and each shows a distinct hilar appendage. The combined characters of Archaeomarasmius indicate a relation to the modern family Tricholomataceae, with a close similarity to the genera Marasmius and Marasmiellus. Both genera are noted for marcescence, toughening and drying, rather than putrifying. This property would increase the chances of a mushroom becoming entombed in amber. However, a number of other species are also possible close relatives of Archaeomarasmius, mostly in Tricholomataceae, although some species in the family Strophariaceae are also marasmioid. The authors suggest it may also be appropriate to classify Archaeomarasmius more conservatively as incertae sedis (of uncertain placement) within the Tricholomatoceae, Agaricales, or Homobasidiomycetes. Associated inclusions The amber specimen \\"AMNH NJ-90\\", which preserved the two holotypes, also preserved a number of other inclusions that give indications as to what the ecology of Archaeomarasmius may have been. Of the approximately forty insect inclusions present, flies in the families Ceratopogonidae and Chironomidae, together with caddisflies of the order Trichoptera, suggest that the mushroom was growing near fresh water. Beetles from the family Elateridae, a termite and a pseudoscorpion, in addition to the mushroom, are indicators of rotting wood, probably from a tree in the family Cupressaceae. Modern Marasmiaceae members are saprobic‚Äîobtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter‚Äîand specimens included with Archaeomarasmius indicate a similar habit for the mushroom.

Aureofungus is one of only four known agarics fungus species known in the fossil record and the third to be described from Dominican amber. History and classification The genus is known only from the holotype fossil, which is a single fruiting body currently residing in the private collection owned by Yale Goldman of Connecticut United States. The specimen was collected in August 2000 from the Yanigua Mine, El Valle in the eastern Dominican Republic. It was first studied by a group of researchers led by Dr. David Hibbett of the Clark University. Hibbett et al published their 2003 type description in the journal Mycologia. The generic epithet Aureofungus is Latin in derivation and means \\"golden fungus\\" while the specific epithet \\"yaniguaensis\\" was coined by the authors from \\"Yanigua\\" in recognition of the type locality. When described Aureofungus yaniguaensis was the fourth species of fossil agaric fungus to be described. Two species Coprinites dominicana and Protomycena electra are also from the amber mines of the Dominican Republic, while the third species Archaeomarasmius leggeti is from the older Cretaceous age New Jersey Amber.

The lightly textured flesh is yellow- brown in coloration and sports a striated, incurved margin. The lamellae or gills are subdistant and lacking lamellulae, short gills which do not reach the edge of the pileus. The pileus is centered on the stipe, which is long and lacking the volva, annulus and any rhizoids. The basidiospores associated with the fruiting body are grouped in masses and appear to have been produced by the fruiting body after entombment in the resin. Each basidiospore is broadly elliptic and approximately 4.0Œºm by 3.3Œºm. These combined characters indicate a possible relation to the modern Tricholomataceae or some of the \\"dusky- spored taxa\\" such as Coprinellus disseminatus. However the thickness of the amber entombing the specimen prevented study finer details, such as spore ornamentation and pileus texture, which would have clarified the relations. As such Hibbett et al left the placement of Aureofungus as Agaricales incertae sedis.

At present it contains the single species Protomycena electra, known from a single specimen collected in an amber mine in the Cordillera Septentrional area of the Dominican Republic. The fruit body of the fungus has a convex cap that is in diameter, with distantly spaced gills on the underside. The curved stipe is smooth and cylindrical, measuring thick by long, and lacks a ring. It resembles extant (currently living) species of the genus Mycena. Protomycena is one of only five known agaric fungus species known in the fossil record and the second to be described from Dominican amber. Discovery and classification The genus is known only from the holotype specimen, a single fruit body (mushroom) currently residing in the private collection owned by Ettore Morone of Turin, Italy. The specimen was collected in one of the amber mines in the Cordillera Septentrional area of the island of Hispaniola, in the Dominican Republic. The amber is believed to date from the Miocene Burdigalian stage, about 20 to 16 million years before the present. It was first studied by a group of researchers consisting of David Hibbett and Michael Donoghue from Harvard University, with David Grimaldi of the American Museum of Natural History. Hibbett and colleagues published their 1997 type description in the American Journal of Botany. The generic name Protomycena is noted as \\"first\\", and \\"Mycena\\", a modern genus that it resembles. The specific epithet electra was coined by the authors from the Latin or Greek word for \\"amber\\", in reference to the mode of preservation. When it was reported, Protomycena electra was the third species of fossil agaric fungus to be described. The two species Coprinites dominicana and Aureofungus yaniguaensis are also known from the amber mines of the Dominican Republic, while the fourth species Archaeomarasmius leggeti is from the older, Cretaceous age New Jersey Amber. With the 2007 publication of a fifth extinct agaric species, Palaeoagaracites antiquus, the minimum age for the order Agaricales was pushed back to the Albian (approximately 100 Ma). Description M. adscendens shown here. The holotype of Protomycena is a single fruit body without any associated structures, preserved in a piece of clear light yellow polished amber approximately wide. The pileus is in diameter and has a convex shape, sporting a raised central region (an umbo). The pale flesh appears yellowish in the amber, and is smooth and glossy, changing to striate and slightly translucent towards the margin. The pileus margin is striated and slightly flared. The gills on the underside of the pileus are broadly attached (adnate) to the top of the stipe, and distantly spaced‚Äîbetween six and eight gills extend completely from the pileus margin to the stipe. These full-length gills are anastomosed with lamellulae (short gills which do not reach the edge of the stipe from the pileus margin) of varying lengths. The pileus is centered on the curved stipe, which is smooth and cylindrical, measuring thick by long. The stipe lacks a ring and rhizoids. The mushroom is preserved with a small liquid and gas-filled bubble, possibly originating from the mushroom itself, which indicates the amber to be very solid and well-sealed. In Hibbett and colleagues' 1997 publication, Protomycena was placed in the subfamily Myceneae, which at the time was considered part of the family Tricholomataceae; Mycena is currently classified in the family Mycenaceae. The placement was based solely on the visible structures, or macromorphology of the fruit body. Many of the features which are typically used to classify species into fungal families and subfamilies are based on microscopic features not visible or preserved in the amber specimen. Consequently, the assignment to Mycena is provisional (the authors also note certain similarities with extant members of Marasmius), and the describing authors leave open the option of treating the genus placement as incertae sedis (uncertain placement) within the Agaricales. Protomycena is distinct from other amber-preserved mushroom taxa such as Coprinites, in the grooved surface of its pileus and its anastomosing gills.

This recently described species is endemic to eastern Madagascar. The specific epithet is derived from the term ‚Äúangolafa‚Äù or ‚Äúangolafo‚Äù, which is the Malagasy vernacular name used by the Betsimisaraka people for the Dypsis palm species (mostly for Dypsis lastelliana), whose leaves and prophylls are the habitat for this frog. Description Blommersia angolafa is a small frog, with a body size of 17‚Äì21 mm, enlarged tips on fingers and toes, and without any dark area in the tympanic and frenal region, present in the other Blommersia. B. angolafa has a rather uniform dorso-lateral colouration, shading from yellowish‚Äìlight brownish to dark brown, with light-bluish spots on the flanks and light-bluish terminal parts of the fingers and toes. The species also appears to be chromatically sexually dimorphic. In fact, males differ from females in having a light colouration, while females are more brownish. Blommersia angolafa is similar to B. grandisonae. Although both B. angolafa and B. grandisonae have enlarged finger tips, they are much more developed in B. angolafa. =Eggs and tadpoles= Egg clutches are found only from December onwards; they are glued to the inside walls of palms' dead prophylls filled with water and fallen on the ground. Several different stages of tadpoles can be found sharing the water accumulated within the same fallen prophyll. Under captive conditions, all the eggs of a single clutch hatched after a period of 7‚Äì10 days, and the total duration of the larval development was 57‚Äì70 days. Distribution and habitat Blommersia angolafa occurs at four forest blocks in eastern Madagascar: Masoala, Ambatovaky, Zahamena and Betampona and occupies rain forest with an elevation range between 90 m (Ankavanana River, Masoala Peninsula) and 508 m (Vohitsivalana, RNI de Betampona). It is found both in primary and secondary forest, due to the tolerance of some Dypsis palms to occur in secondary rain forest at Betampona. The observed elevational distribution at Betampona ranged from 332‚Äì548 m asl. Andreone et al. suggest that this species may also occur at other rain forest sites that fall within this elevational and latitudinal range for eastern Madagascar, such as Makira and Mananara Nord. Life history, activity and special behaviours A peculiar aspect characterising this species is its novel life history and reproductive mode. Both sexes live and breed in a phytotelmic habitat of water accumulated within fallen prophylls and fallen leaf sheaths of at least three species of Dypsis palms. Within these phytotelmata, egg laying and complete larval development occur. Andreone et al. never observed individuals outside dead fallen Dypsis phytotelmata that were lying on the forest floor or that contained rainfall. =Call= The advertisement call of B. angolafa starts at the end of September and continues mostly continuously until the end of February to early March. Calling males are usually heard during the dusk and early at night. The call consists of two notes, rather similar to those described for B. grandisonae and B. domerguei. Note of type 1 is a long and clearly pulsed note with a duration of 221‚Äì233 ms and consisting of 9‚Äì11 pulses that are repeated with a pulse repetition rate of 44‚Äì52 per second. One such pulsed note is followed by an irregular series of up to 13‚Äì29 notes of type 2 which are shorter and of irregular structure. Notes of type 2 can be short clicks consisting of a single main pulse and with a duration of 10‚Äì17 ms (n=2) or can consist of up to eight distinctly separated pulses each and then have durations of 63‚Äì86 ms, with all intermediate states occurring so that a clear distinction of further different note types is not possible. Intervals between notes of type 2 in a note series have a duration of 73‚Äì191 ms. The frequency appears as a more or less regular band between about 2,500‚Äì5,500 Hz; although, the fundamental frequency may be higher than 2,500 Hz. Trends and threats B. angolafa are only known from phytotelmata of Dypsis palms. These palms are suffering from selective logging and deforestation. Thus, the conservation situation for B. angolafa is potentially and negatively affected by the palms' threatened status. Most of the Dypsis palms (or at least Dypsis lastelliana) are also threatened by selective logging habitat destruction, fire, harvesting for palm heart, and plant and seed collection by palm enthusiasts. Phylogenetic relationships Andreone et al. suggest that the reproductive mode of B. angolafa is a derived character, having evolved from the more typical reproduction in lentic water bodies. The general scarcity of lentic habitats in Malagasy rain forests may have provided the conditions that favoured the evolution of this phytotelmic breeding strategy.

It is a blowback, select fire, Uzi type design, open bolt submachine gun, with a side folding stock. The design and function of the parts is based on various existing submachine guns (like Suomi M1931 for the trigger mechanism and Ingram MAC-10 for bolt security etc.), along with some of the author's own innovations and solutions, for example the bolt construction and folding stock. Although the subtitle of the book detailing its design and constructions calls it \\"homemade\\", the design is mainly intended for a more professional, almost mass-production kind of manufacture. Its designer calls for any constructor to be skilled at metalwork, with access to a shop lathe, drill press and milling machine (the last being optional but very helpful). M√©tral himself says of the main spring, barrel and magazine construction: \\"Try doing it yourself only if you have no other choice\\" and calls them \\"difficult to build\\". Some parts need hardening, which is usually beyond the means of an amateur, and several parts are intended to be purchased or having them made to order.

He found a position as proof-reader at a newspaper, where he became interested in writing. His first sketch was published in 1866. His novel Foundations (1883) was published in Annals of the Fatherland. The main subjects of his works were the peasants, and the populist intellectuals.

Carlo Rossetti (Roscetti) (1614 ‚Äì 23 November 1681) was an Italian Catholic Cardinal, born of the noble Rossetti family in Ferrara. Earlier in his career he went to London as a secret nuncio on behalf of Pope Urban VIII. While in London, he was addressed as Lord Charles Rossetti and was referred to as Prince Rossetti, using his title as Italian nobility for his cover, rather than as a representative of the Roman Catholic Church to avoid persecution. Early life Born of the noble Rossetti family in Ferrara, he was baptized in the Cathedral of S. Giorgio Martire on 26 March 1614. He was named Canon of the Cathedral of Ferrara, and was granted a papal dispensation because he was below the minimum age.Patritius Gauchat, Hierarchia catholica medii et recentioris aevi IV, editio altera (Monasterii 1935), p. 328 note 5. Rossetti went to Rome as a young man. At the age of eighteen he engaged in a public disputation (i.e. took his Bacculaureate) in philosophy and theology, in the presence of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, the nephew of Pope Urban VIII. He then studied law at the University of Bologna, and took his degree in utroque iure (both Canon Law and Civil Law).Cardella, p. 32. Cardinal Barberini sang his praises to Pope Urban VIII, who appointed him a prelate and Referendary of the Two Signatures (Grace and Justice); this gave Rossetti the right to practice law before the Roman courts.Cardella, p. 32. Christoph Weber, Die p√§pstlichen Referendare 1566-1809: Chronologie und Prosopographie (Stuttgart: Hiersemann, 2004). He served Pope Urban VIII and his Barberini family, especially his nephews Francesco Barberini and Antonio Barberini.Carlo Rossetti by S. Miranda (Florida International University, last updated May 2012) Nuncio in London The Barberini were impressed by his vigour, wit and discernment and sent him as nuncio first to Germany, then to England as successor to the papal agent, George Con, who was gravely ill. There he provided financial support to Irish Catholics fighting against the Parliament of England. He arrived in August 1639.Alison Plowden, Henrietta Maria: Charles I's Indomitable Queen (Stroud : Sutton, 2001), p. 135. His mission was undertaken under a transparent disguise, as one Italian historian recalled:Il Conte Bisaccione, Delle Guerre Civili d'Inghilterra (1653), 2nd edition, as quoted by John Bargrave, Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals, pp. 17-18. Rossetti's mission was considered especially dangerous, given the conflict between the Church and England at the time. Even contemporary Italian authors dared not publish his real identity for fear the prelate's life may be threatened.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) But Rossetti's clandestine mission was successful in many regards. He managed to convince some at the English court to banish Roman Catholic priests from England, rather than execute them. When contemporary detractors suggested King Charles I of England and his Archbishop William Laud were papists, Rossetti bravely took the opportunity to suggest the King might consider converting to Catholicism, seeing as though he was being accused of as much anyway. Charles' Queen, Henrietta Maria, saw Rossetti's position at court as potentially advantageous and, having developed a social relationship with the clandestine nobleman, urged the prelate to write to the uncle of his Barberini patrons, Pope Urban VIII, asking for the equivalent of ¬£100,000 pounds sterling to aid England's ailing coffers. The Pope responded saying he was, \\"...very ready to supply the King so soon as ever he should declare himself a Catholic\\". When the bill of attainder was passed and Archbishop William Laud was sentenced to death, some suggested Laud would have been better off had he converted to Catholicism and escaped to Rome (as Rossetti had urged) rather than staying to fight for which he was executed. Return to Rome At the outbreak of the First Bishops' War, Rossetti's life was threatened. At the behest of the Queen Henrietta Maria gave him refuge in St. James's Palace.Whitaker, p. 177. Thereafter he was summoned to appear before the House of Commons of England but instead fled England at the end of June 1641.The outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 by M. Perceval-Maxwell (McGill-Queens, 1994) He went to Flanders with the assistance of the Venetian ambassador. His presence at Ghent on 7 September 1641 is established by a letter written by him to one of the Cardinals Barberini, containing a report on the intended colonization of Maryland.\\"Documents,\\" American Historical Review 12 (1907), pp. 584-587. He then returned to Rome and to the service of the Barberini. After he returned to Rome he was appointed Archbishop of Tarsus on 16 September 1641.Patritius Gauchat, Hierarchia catholica medii et recentioris aevi IV, editio altera (Monasterii 1935), p. 328. Since this was a titular See, his appointment was a direct action by the Pope, who intended to send him on a diplomatic mission, for which he needed episcopal status. He was consecrated bishop on 8 December 1641 in Cologne, by Bishop Fabio Chigi, the Apostolic Nuncio to Cologne. Rossetti had been dispatched, with the title of Nuncio Extraordinary, to the Congress of M√ºnster, where an effort to find a solution to the Thirty Years' War was being attempted.Cardella, pp. 33-34. After the Congress, he stayed on as Nuncio in Cologne for two years. On 4 May 1643 he was translated to the See of Faenza in succession to Cardinal Francesco Cennini, who resigned the office. Though he was promoted Bishop of Tusculum (Frascati) in 1676, he retained the Administration of Faenza until his death in 1681.Gauchat, p. 185, with note 7. During his time in charge of Faenza, he conducted no less than nine diocesan synods.Ferdinandus Ughelli, Italia sacra (ed. N. Colet) Tomus 2 (Venice: Sebastian Colet 1717), p. 512. Cardella, p. 34. Cardinal Rossetti In the Consistory of 13 July 1643 Archbishop Carlo Rossetti was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope Urban VIII.Gauchat, p. 26. In September 1643, Rossetti was named Legatus a latere and sent as ambassador to Cologne, but he was recalled next year, due to the grave illness of the Pope. He left Germany on 11 May 1644, but did not reach Rome in time to be at the Pope's deathbed.Ferrero, p. 4 and p. 8 n. Pope Urban died on 29 July 1644, and Rossetti participated in the Papal conclave of 1644, which opened on August 9.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante and Conclave of 1644. Retrieved: 2016-03-18. He was of course a loyal supporter of the Barberini faction. Despite his understandable support for the French nominee, Giulio Cesare Sacchetti, Rossetti suffered no ill effects when Giovanni Battista Pamphili took office as Pope Innocent X. On 28 November 1644 he was installed as Cardinal Deacon of the Deaconry of San Cesareo in Palatio. On 18 August 1653 Rossetti was translated (moved) to the titulus of Santa Maria in Via Lata, and then on 9 March 1654 to San Silvestro in Capite. There he remained for 18 years until his appointment, on 14 November 1672, as Cardinal Priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina. From 12 January 1654 to 10 January 1656 he served a term as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals.Gauchat, p. 59. However, during the papal conclave of 1655, Cardinal Rossetti worked against the candidacy of Cardinal Fabio Chigi. When Cardinal Chigi was elected to the papal throne as Pope Alexander VII, Rossetti returned to his diocese of Faenza and did not visit Rome for any significant length of time until the papal conclave of 1667. He participated in the Conclave of 1667, where his vote was actively sought by the ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany on behalf of Cardinal d'Elci. Elci's candidacy failed, however, in the face of determined opposition, and Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi was elected as Pope Clement XI with the support of the Barberini faction.Sede Vacante 1667 by John Paul Adams, (California State University.

It is committed to the promotion and protection of all human rights including the right to development. FORUM-ASIA was founded in 1991 in Manila, The Philippines and opened its Regional Secretariat in Bangkok in 1992. Subsequently, offices have also been opened in Geneva, Jakarta and Kathmandu. It has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 2004. FORUM-ASIA is committed to building a peaceful, just, equitable and ecologically sustainable community of peoples and societies in Asia, where all human rights of all individuals, groups and peoples ‚Äì in particular, the poor, marginalised and discriminated against ‚Äì are fully respected and realised in accordance with internationally accepted human rights norms and standards.  History  =Founding (1991‚Äì1994)= In December 1991, a regional consultation, 'On Collaboration between Human Rights Organisations in South and South-East Asia', was held in Manila, the Philippines. During the meeting a new network was established, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum- Asia). The idea for the consultation came from D.J. Ravindran, former Legal Officer for Asia for the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ). Prior to the consultation he had visited several countries in the region to gain input for a working paper to be used during the event. This first consultation had participants from nine countries representing 19 organisations, who became the founding members of Forum-Asia.Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA), (1991), A compilation of Documents of the Founding Consultation held in Manila, the Philippines, December 1991, FORUM-ASIA: Bangkok, Thailand. These organisations were: * Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK) from Bangladesh * Legal Resource for Social Action (LRSA) from India * Indonesia Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) from Indonesia * Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM) from Malaysia * Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) from Nepal * Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) from Pakistan * Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP) from the Philippines * Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA) from the Philippines * Protestant Lawyers League of the Philippines (PLLP) from the Philippines * Pilipina Legal Resources Center (PLRC) from the Philippines * Paglilingkod Batas Pangkapapatiran Foundation (PBPF) from the Philippines * Tanggol-Kalikasan (TK) from the Philippines * Paralegal Training and Service Center (PTSC) from the Philippines * Movement for Inter-Racial Justice and Equality (MIRJE) from Sri Lanka * Law and Society Trust (LST) from Sri Lanka * Information Human Rights Documentation Centre (INFORM) from Sri Lanka * Union for Civil Liberty (UCL) from Thailand * Coordination Group for Religion in Society (CGRS) from Thailand * Friends of Women Foundation (FWF) from Thailand. The initial objectives of Forum-Asia were to conduct programmes to further strengthen the effectiveness of human rights organisations in the region and to facilitate collaboration between them.Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA), (1994), Report of Activities 1992- 1994, FORUM-ASIA: Bangkok, Thailand. The idea was that while there was an increase in organisations working in Asia on human rights, these organisations were mostly set up or run by groups in Europe or North America. The notion was that the region needed a regional network that was set up by Asians for Asians. Forum-Asia would provide a voice for victims of human rights abuses, their families and those that were attempting to defend them, the human right defenders (HRDs) themselves. There was a conscious choice to include both human rights and development in the name. While most, if not all, organisations initially involved were human rights organisations, there was a recognition of the interconnectedness of the human rights concerns that many of the founding members worked on with socio-economic development, including developmental and economic inequality, and market globalisation. Throughout Forum-Asia's history so far though ‚Äì that is till 2016 ‚Äì the development part of its name has been overshadowed by the work on human rights. The first months after the founding meeting were spent drafting proposals and raising funds. D.J. Ravindran was asked to help develop and establish the organisation as a consultant, and was joined in this task by Chalida Tajaroensuk. During the 1991 meeting it had been suggested that Forum-Asia should be hosted by one of the founding organisations. The UCL, based in Bangkok, Thailand became the host to the regional secretariat of the network. Ms. Songphorn Tajaroensuk became the first Secretary General of Forum-Asia. The first activity that Forum-Asia undertook was organised jointly with TFDP and PTSC. It was a ‚ÄòRegional Training Programme on Fact-Finding and Documentation of Human Rights Violations', which took place on 27 September-12 October 1992 in Manila. It was an indication of the initial focus of the network. During the first years the activities and campaigns of Forum-Asia largely centred on capacity building with the vision of strengthening the member organisations in the region. Building on the experience of some of the members, these skills were shared and spread throughout the network. In 1993, Forum-Asia became involved in the UN World Conference on Human Rights, including in the preparatory process that resulted in the ‚ÄòFinal Declaration of the Regional Meeting for Asia of the World Conference on Human Rights or Bangkok Declaration'. This was the start of the advocacy component of Forum-Asia's work. Something which would become a central part of its strategies in the following years. On 14‚Äì17 October 1994, the first General Assembly (GA) of Forum-Asia was held at the Wangree Resort in Nakorn Nayok, Thailand.Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA), (1994), Report of Proceedings of the First General Assembly, FORUM-ASIA: Bangkok, Thailand. The first three years had been labelled to be an experimental period from the start, so the GA focussed primarily on reviewing this period and making decisions for the future. During the meeting it was agreed that Forum-Asia had a distinct character and role to play and should therefore be continued and expanded. Given its status as being in an experimental phase, no full-fledged Secretariat had been set up in the first years. During the 1994 GA it was decided that such a full-fledged Secretariat should be established, yet remain an unregistered association that would not seek judicial status. As such, it was decided that UCL would continue to host the Secretariat. =Consolidation and growth (1994‚Äì2004)= With Forum-Asia no longer being in the experimental phase, the time to strengthen and expand the network started after the GA of 1994. New strategies and programmes were developed, including diplomacy, human rights education, advocacy and campaigning. The Secretariat also expanded its work on particular focus areas, including from 1995 on women's human rights. In 1995 Forum-Asia undertook its first country mission. The regional mission to Burma focused on assessing the situation in the country. The group met with different stakeholders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and based on these engagements assessed how Forum-Asia could assist the HRDs of the country to improve the human rights situation in Burma. A year later, in 1996, the involvement of Forum-Asia in Burma became instrumental to the establishment of the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma (ALTSEAN-Burma), a network of organisations and individuals based in Member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that support the movement for human rights and democracy in Burma. Forum-Asia's involvement in the developmental stage of new initiatives has been repeated multiple times during the network's existence. Forum-Asia would be part of identifying a key concern or issue related to human rights, it would (co-)organise a meeting on the topic, during which a new network or collective would be established. Often, Forum-Asia would initially fulfil the role of Secretariat or host the Secretariat for the new group before they became independent. In this manner the Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL) was established in 1997. ANFREL works to promote and support democratisation at national and regional levels across Asia. They focus on elections and election monitoring. Another example is Forum-Asia's involvement with the non-governmental organisations (NGO) Coalition for the International Criminal Court (CICC) in 2001. With time, the particular organisational priorities of Forum-Asia changed. In a report from 1999 the network describes itself by stating that '... It strives to promote, on the basis of global perspective, a regional initiative towards the protection of human rights, development and peace in the region through collaboration of human rights and development NGOs and people's organizations in Asia.Ramaseshan, Geeta, (1999), Narrative Report of Regional Workshop on Civil Political Rights: Integrating Human Rights Standards ‚Äì 26‚Äì28 June 1999, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, FORUM-ASIA: Bangkok, Thailand. Testimony to this growing focus on global advocacy, was the granting of consultative status to Forum-Asia in 2004 to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC status) after a two year application process. ECOSOC status provided Forum-Asia with access to ECOSOC, its many subsidiary bodies, the various human rights mechanisms of the United Nations (UN), ad-hoc processes on small arms, and special events organised by the President of the General Assembly. To be able to obtain ECOSOC status, the Forum-Asia Foundation was officially registered in 2000. However, developing, expanding and strengthening a network is not easy. Known challenges that civil society organisations (CSOs) face across the globe, are multi-layered by additional complications when working through a regional network. Reflections from 2002 highlight the emergence of Forum-Asia [as] a regional entity recognized by governments, intergovernmental organizations and civil society groups in the region and elsewhere. It has emerged as a major partner in most leading human rights activities.Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA), (2002), Report of Activities 2002, FORUM-ASIA: Bangkok, Thailand. However, at the same time it was also said that 'We are still faced with the challenge of linking human rights activism from local, national, regional and global level. ... we have to acknowledge that not all members are equally engaged in all the campaigns and activities conducted by Forum-Asia. While by no means unique to a network organisation, Forum-Asia decided to address these issues and those raised in a previous evaluation. In 2003 it established a project on 'Transforming the Secretariat'. An external consultant, Deep Rai, was tasked to address the challenges and needs identified by staff and the Executive Committee.Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA), (2003), Report of Activities January- December 2003 Draft, FORUM-ASIA: Bangkok, Thailand. =Independence (2005‚Äì2013)= Initiated by the aforementioned evaluation and the project, 'Transforming the Secretariat', a process was set in motion to change Forum-Asia. At the GA of 2004 it was decided that a new function would be established, being that of an Executive Director. In January 2005, Anselmo Lee was the first to take this position. The position of Executive Director of Forum-Asia would later be held by Yap Swee Seng, Giyoun Kim (Acting), and Evelyn Balais-Serrano. The restructuring process also led to the decision to establish the network as an independent body. A change that was not to the agreement of all. Forum-Asia set up its own office, and went through the difficult process of re- establishing itself. With this came an adjustment in the name, from Forum-Asia to FORUM-ASIA. It was a difficult period in the history of the organisation and network, but one that was necessary in its evolution. The changes prompted FORUM-ASIA to re-evaluate its strategies and programmes. By 2005 the network consisted of 36 members in 14 countries. The refocusing of its strategic priorities led to a stronger focus on international advocacy and coalition building. A highlight of which was the establishment of the Geneva OfficeOfficially called the International Office. in 2006. The objective of the Geneva Office was and continues to be two-fold. First is to increase the impact and effectiveness of FORUM-ASIA and its members' advocacy in UN fora. Second is to encourage accountability of Asian member states to UN Human Rights Mechanisms. In 2010 the Geneva example paved the way for the establishment of an office in Jakarta. The objective was and still is to monitor, engage with and inform FORUM-ASIA members about the developments of ASEAN, in particularly those related to the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) and the ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children (ACWC). The office is hosted by the Komisi untuk Orang Hilang dan Korban Tindak Kekerasan (KontraS or Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of Violence), a prominent member organisation of FORUM-ASIA in Indonesia. In 2006, FORUM-ASIA was involved in two notable other initiatives. The establishment of the Solidarity for Asian People's Advocacy (SAPA) ‚Äì a network focussed on cross-sectoral partnerships build around shared advocacy targets ‚Äì and the creation of the Asian NGO Network on National Human Rights Institutions (ANNI). An external evaluation from 2007 concluded that '... the principal added value [of FORUM-ASIA] is a) protection ... b) facilitating regional and international human rights advocacy, and c) providing a platform for learning and collective action ... .'Real, Mary Jane, and Ricardo Wilson-Grau, (2007), Participatory Evaluation of FORUM-ASIA's Results July 2004-June 2007, FORUM-ASIA: Bangkok, Thailand. This observation indicated another shift in FORUM-ASIA's efforts away from the focus on capacity building from the initial years of FORUM- ASIA. Furthering the tradition of involvement in the birth of new networks and coalitions, FORUM-ASIA was part of the establishment of the Asia Pacific Refugees Rights Network (APRRN) in 2008. FORUM-ASIA hosted APRRNs first coordinator after his appointment in 2010, and hosted the network during its formative years to allow it to grow. APRRN became independent in 2012. One of FORUM-ASIA's latest initiatives, in this tradition, was the Regional Initiative for a South Asia Human Right Mechanism (RISAHRM). RISAHRM's aim is to establish a South Asian human rights mechanism that brings together national processes and regional aspirations. =2013‚Äì2016= In 2013 a new management team was appointed, led by Evelyn Balais-Serrano as Executive Director, to guide FORUM-ASIA into a new period. With the 25 year anniversary in 2016 coming up the network and organisation once again needed to reflect and re-evaluate the role, the added value and the priorities of the movement. In recognition of the desire of many to make capacity building and training once again a central component of FORUM-ASIA's work, in 2013 it initiated the Glo-cal Advocacy Leadership in Asia Academy (GALA Academy) together with the Asian Development Alliance (ADA) and the Asian Democracy Network (ADN). The aim of the GALA Academy is to strengthen the international advocacy capacity of mid- and high-level staff in civil society organisations (CSOs). Realising the need to enhance FORUM-ASIA's advocacy efforts in South Asia, the Kathmandu office, in Nepal was established in 2015. Hosted by founding member, INSEC, the Kathmandu office provides a permanent presence to strengthen and consolidate the human rights movement through effective collaboration with member and partner organisations in South Asia.

She was Jewish and very well educated. Despite being married, for many years she had what appears to have been an extremely close relationship, by correspondence only, with a writer, Ansaldo Ceb√†, whom she admired but whom she never actually met. He was a Christian, and at that point in his life he had become a monk. He appears to have fallen in love with Sarra, and constantly urged her to convert to Christianity, but she resisted. In 1621, Sarra was accused of a serious crime of belief, a heresy, and was in danger of trial by Inquisition. She received almost no support from many of her friends, including Ceb√†. She died of natural causes in 1641. Of her writings, a number of her sonnets and her Manifesto (a response to the accusation of heresy) are all that have survived to the present day. Early life Sarra was born in Venice in 1592 to a Jewish family. Her parents, Simon and Ricca Copia, had two more daughters, Rachel and Esther. Sarra was given a basic education in both Jewish and Italian cultures, and learned several languages including Ancient Greek, Latin and Hebrew. In her poetry, Sarra demonstrated her knowledge of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, as well as her familiarity with the works of Aristotle and Josephus. She started writing poetry in Italian at a young age and continued for the rest of her life. As an adult she married Jacob Sullam. She and her husband loved the arts, and invited to their home both Christian and Jewish writers, poets, intellectuals, artists, and clerics. She was described as a woman who \\"revelled in the realm of beauty, and crystallized her enthusiasm in graceful, sweet, maidenly verses. Young, lovely, of generous impulses and keen intellectual powers, her ambition set upon lofty attainments, a favorite of the muses, Sarra Copia charmed youth and age.\\" Sarra and Ansaldo Ceb√† In 1618, Sarra read the book L‚ÄôEster, a drama written by an author called Ansaldo Ceb√†. Twenty seven years her senior, Ansaldo Ceb√† had been a diplomat when he was younger, but had decided to spend the rest of his life living as a monk. He had gone on retreat in one of Genoa's monasteries. Ceb√†'s book made a great impression on Sarra, and so she wrote a letter to him. In the letter she admitted that she carried the book with her all the time, and even slept with it. Ceb√† responded to Sarra's letter, and this was the start of four years of letters, gifts and poems, exchanged between the two. Ansaldo Ceb√† wrote to Sarra that he wanted to help her convert to Christianity. He was aware of how beautiful Sarra was, because his servant, whom he sent with presents for her, had told him so. And on one occasion Sarra sent Ceb√† her portrait, writing: \\"This is the picture of one who carries yours deeply graven on her heart, and, with finger pointing to her bosom, tells the world: \\"Here dwells my idol, bow before him.\\"\\" Eventually Ansaldo's desire to convert Sarra to Christianity became something more significant: it seems he fell in love with her, a love that was not necessarily just platonic. Their correspondence became more intimate, with some physical allusions and some sexual implications. It was as if they both were playing a game of love, although nothing was ever completely spelled out. Ansaldo wrote to Sarra that if she would convert to Christianity, after death they would be united in Heaven. Sarra's name was originally spelled \\"Coppia\\" meaning \\"pair\\" or \\"couple\\", and in one of Ceb√†'s letters to her, he said that the two letter \\"p\\"s in her name were an indication that the two of them could indeed become a couple, despite the fact that he was a Catholic monk and she was married. After that, Sarra started spelling her name with a single \\"p\\": Copia. All the way to the end of their correspondence, Ceb√† tried to convert Sarra; this became the greatest desire of a man who was getting older and whose health was now failing. However, Sarra never submitted to his wish. She did however give Ansaldo permission to pray for her conversion to Christianity, and in return he allowed her to pray for his conversion to Judaism. Sarra and Ansaldo never actually met. In 1623, Ceb√† published 53 letters that he had written to Sarra. Sarra's letters to Ceb√† were never published, and are lost. The Manifesto Baldassarre Bonifacio was a prominent Christian cleric who had been a guest at Sarra and her husband's receptions. In 1621, he wrote a treatise Immortalit√† dell‚Äôanima (On the Immortality of the Soul). According to Bonifacio's account, two years before that, Sarra had caused him to realize that she did not believe in the immortality of the soul. This was a very serious accusation of a crime of belief which could have resulted in a trial by inquisition. In response, Sarra wrote a work entitled, Manifesto di Sarra Copia Sulam hebrea Nel quale √® da lei riprovate, e detestata l‚Äôopinione negante l‚ÄôImmortalit√† dell‚ÄôAnima, falsemente attribuitale da SIG. BALDASSARE BONIFACIO, translation: The Manifesto of Sarra Copia Sulam, a Jewish woman, in which she refutes and disavows the opinion denying immortality of the soul, falsely attributed to her by Signor Baldassare Bonifacio. The Manifesto was dedicated to her beloved father, who died when she was 16 years old. In this work she defended her points of view, and attacked Bonifacio. At the beginning of her response to Bonifacio's accusation was the following poem: Sarra sent a copy of the Manifesto to Ceb√†, but he responded to her only after a few months delay, and instead of offering her help, he once again urged her to convert to Christianity. This was the last letter that Ceb√†, who died soon after, wrote to Sarra. Many of her friends and teachers stopped supporting her during her time of need. Not until 1625 did an anonymous author publish papers in her defense. Sarra died in February 1641, after a three-month illness.

The upper floor consists of a dance hall with a balcony. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History The Danes Hall was organized by eleven members of the Danish club on January 6, 1877. The group grew to a maximum membership of 300 members before dwindling to 32 by 1940. The building was designed by William Waters. The building contained a library with over 1000 books. In the winter of 1876-1877, the Wisconsin Central Railroad had just been completed to Ashland Wisconsin and many of the men who had worked on the line were idle. Combined with the young men idled by the lack of work on the local farms, there was an enormous number of men who had no place to go for an evening of companionship and amusement, except at the local saloons. A group of members of the Waupaca community got together to see what could be done to provide these men with a more suitable environment to gather. Lars Larson, William Bendixen and Nels Larson from Waupaca and A.P. Larson from Farmington township circulated a pledge and a petition. When 12 people had signed the pledge a room was rented in the wooden building owned by O.O. Olson. The first meeting was held On January 6, 1877. Each signer paid a fee of 50 cents and The Danes Home was born. A short time later this building was destroyed by fire. The Danes Home (De Danske Hjem) was the first lodge to organize for social and literary purposes. In 1882 it incorporated under the laws of Wisconsin. The constitution and bylaws were adopted and the name \\"The Danes Home\\" was formally adopted. The bylaws provided that all males born to Danish parents, 18 years of age, or older, who were able to read and speak the Danish language, would be eligible for membership. Gambling and intoxicating beverages were strictly forbidden on the premises. After some years The Danes Home Society had their own insurance for the benefit of the sick and incapacitated. The charter members were Hans Yorkson, president; A. Rasmussen, vice president; George Nelson, librarian; Jens Peterson, JohnGeorgeson, George Hennegsen, N. Larson, A.P. Anderson and Jens Rasmussen. The newly organized Danes Home rented three more different locations before they made the purchase of a building of their own in 1882. The second location was upstairs in the F. Peterson building: the third location was over the post office in the Chady building on east Union Street south of the Courthouse Square. While located here, the building burned. The next location was over Matt Jensen's market on North Main Street. where the society remained until November 14, 1882 when they purchased the old courthouse that was being moved off of Courthouse Square to make room for a new courthouse building. The old courthouse was purchased for $275, and now the Danes Home Society had a building to be moved to property that had previously been purchased for $600. With the cost of moving the building the total cost for their new home was $1,300. Within 5 years the debt had been discharged and there was money in the treasury, and 560 books in their library. This wooden building served the Society's needs until 1894 when they sold the building and moved it to the west end of the Water Street bridge where it stood until being demolished in 1965. The current Danes Home (Danes Hall) that stands on the corner of Main and Granite Streets was erected in 1894. It was designed by the architect William Waters of Oshkosh, who was a highly respected architect of his time. The plans were drafted by Peter Jensen of Oshkosh who was a former resident of Waupaca. Construction of this three story brick building began in August 1894 and the building was completed on November 22, 1894. The total cost of the new building was $7,000. The Dedication ceremonies took place on November 29, 1894 with about 400 people in attendance. The Waupaca Republican newspaper stated that the building was brilliantly illuminated with electric lights and profusely decorated with festoons of evergreens, flowers, and flags. The newspaper also stated that all who attended enjoyed the exercise, the dance, the music, the social, and the supper. From the description in the Waupaca republican on December 7, 1894, the main entrance from the sidewalk opened through three doors to a vestibule, where there were two doors which led to the assembly hall, ladies parlor, smoking room, cloak room, and ticket office. At the rear there was a wide stairway leading to the dance hall and lecture room. This was a fine dance hall where 15 to 20 couples could dance with ease. In the case of a lecture or other entertainment there was room for 300 chairs and 200 more could be placed in the gallery above, which occupies three sides of the room. At the time of the dedication, and for many years after, the Danes Home was the largest meeting facility in Waupaca. The ballroom was used by the Waupaca National Guard for practicing drills and Waupaca High School used the ballroom for many of their graduation exercises. Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s the Danes Home Society saw a declining membership with the end result being reported in The Waupaca County Post on March 8, 1945; \\"Danes Home, a Waupaca landmark for 50 years is sold.\\" The paper continued \\"One of Waupaca's old landmarks changed ownership last week when the D.A. Hall, opposite the city hall was sold to Henry Bille, local tinsmith. The building had been in the possession of the Danes Home Society for the past 50 years.\\" In June 1975 Mr. Bille sold the former Danes Home building to the law firm of Johnson, Hansen, and Shambeau, but continued to operated his business from this location until April 1977. At that time, Mr. Bille moved his business to King. The building was sold once again and the new owners proceeded in a restoration of the building and on January 17, 1980 it was officially registered on The National Register of Historic Places. Shortly after this, the building saw use as a successful \\"antique mall\\". Several antique dealers sold their merchandise on consignment through the building owners. The ballroom was partitioned off into display areas for the various antique vendors. The main floor and the lower level were also divided for display use. The Danes Home Antiques business operated for several years and then closed in 2015 and moved out. The current owners, Danes Hall L.L.C., purchased the vacant building in August 2016 with the intention of restoring it to its former grandeur as a community landmark and social hall Danes Hall in Waupaca undergoing renovation Danes Hall renovations continue.

Since being developed by James Naismith as a non-contact game that almost anyone can play, basketball has undergone many different rule variations, eventually evolving into the NBA- style game known today. Basketball is one of the most popular and widely viewed sports in the world.  Definition  * Exercise ‚Äì bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health or wellness. * Game ‚Äì structured activity, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more concerned with the expression of ideas. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional sports). ** Ball game ‚Äì game played with a ball. * Sport ‚Äì form of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical fitness and provide entertainment to participants. ** Competitive sport ‚Äì sport in which one or more participants or teams compete against one another. The one that is the most successful in achieving the objective of the game or sport event is the winner. ** Team sport ‚Äì sport that involves players working together towards a shared objective. ** Recreational sport ‚Äì sport engaged in as a leisure time activity. ** Spectator sport ‚Äì sport that is characterized by the presence of spectators, or watchers, at its matches. Spectator sports are a form of entertainment. ** Professional sport ‚Äì sport in which the athletes receive payment for their performance.  Equipment of the game  * Basketball ‚Äì inflated ball used in the game of basketball. Basketballs typically range in size from very small promotional items possibly only a few inches in diameter to extra large balls nearly a foot in diameter used in training exercises to increase the skill of players. The standard size of a basketball for men's competitive play is 29.5 inches in circumference; for women's competitive play, the circumference is 28.5 inches. All competitions in the halfcourt game of 3x3, whether men's, women's, or mixed-sex, use a dedicated ball with the circumference of the women's ball but the weight of the men's ball. ** Rock ‚Äì the ball * Basketball court ‚Äì the playing surface, consisting of a rectangular floor with baskets at either end. In professional or organized basketball, especially when played indoors, it is usually made out of a hardwood, often maple, and highly polished. ** Backcourt ‚Äì (1) The half of the court a team is defending. The opposite of the frontcourt. (2) A team's guards. ** Ball side ‚Äì The half of the court (divided lengthwise) that the ball is on. Also called the \\"strong side.\\" The opposite of the help side. ** Baseline ‚Äì The line that marks the playing boundary at either end of the court. Also called the \\"end line.\\" ** Block ‚Äì The small painted square on the floor next to the basket just outside the lane. ** Downtown ‚Äì Well outside the three-point line. ** Key ‚Äì The free-throw lane and free-throw circle together (originally, the lane was narrower than the circle's diameter, giving the area the appearance of a skeleton key hole) ** Lane ‚Äì The free-throw lane. ** Three-point line ‚Äì the line that separates the two-point area from the three- point area; any shot converted beyond this line counts as three points (except in 3x3, where shots from beyond the arc are worth two points, and free throws and shots from inside the arc worth 1 point). The distance to the three-point line from the center of the basket varies by league: *** High school ‚Äì *** NCAA women ‚Äì *** International and NCAA men ‚Äî to *** WNBA ‚Äì to *** NBA ‚Äì to * Bench ‚Äì (1) Substitutes sitting on the sideline, (2) The bench or chairs they sit on. * Backboard ‚Äì The rectangular platform to which the basket is attached, and measure 6 feet (182.9 cm) by 3.5 feet (106.7 cm). There is a backboard at each end of the court. * Basket ‚Äì steel rim 18 inches (45.7 cm) in diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard. There is a basket at each end of the court. ** Breakaway rim ‚Äì hoop that can bend slightly when a player dunks a basketball, and then instantly snap back into its original shape when the player releases it. It allows players to dunk the ball without shattering the backboard, and it reduces the possibility of wrist injuries. ** Hoop ‚Äì another name for \\"basket\\". * Shot clock ‚Äì A timer designed to increase the pace (and subsequently, the score) by requiring the ball to either touch the rim or enter the basket before the timer expires, resulting in a loss of possession. The time limit is 12 seconds in 3x3; 24 in FIBA (fullcourt), NBA, and WNBA; and 30 in NCAA men's and women's play. See also airball. = Clothing = * Basketball sleeve ‚Äì an accessory similar to a wristband, made out of nylon and spandex, which extends from the biceps to the wrist. * Finger sleeve ‚Äì an accessory that enhances the grip on the ball during a shot and prevents the ball from rolling or slipping to the top of the fingers.  Rules of the game  Rules of basketball * Jump ball ‚Äì method used to begin or resume play in basketball. Two opposing players attempt to gain control of the ball after it is tossed up into the air in between them by an official. * Official ‚Äì a person who has the responsibility to enforce the rules and maintain the order of the game. Also applies to the scorers and timekeepers, as well as other personnel who have an active role in maintaining the game. * Three-point field goal ‚Äì also known as a three-pointer, it is a field goal made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc radiating from the basket. A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-point line. * Three seconds rule ‚Äì when a player stays in the lane (see above) for three seconds or more. Penalties vary on offense or defense. = Infractions =  Fouls  Foul ‚Äì Violation of the rules other than a floor violation, generally when a player attempts to gain advantage by physical contact. Penalized by a change in possession or free-throw opportunities. * Block ‚Äì A violation in which a defender steps in front of a dribbler but is still moving when they collide. Also called a \\"blocking foul.\\" * Charge ‚Äì A violation in which one player makes illegal contact with another player who has an established position. Also called a \\"charging foul.\\" * Flagrant foul ‚Äì An unsportsmanlike foul in which there is no serious attempt to play the ball. * Personal foul ‚Äì a breach of the rules that concerns illegal personal contact with an opponent. It is the most common type of foul in basketball. Due to the nature of the game, personal fouls occur on occasion and are not always regarded as unsportsmanlike. However, a contact foul involving excessive or unjustified contact is classed as an unsportsmanlike foul (or in the NBA, flagrant foul). * Offensive foul ‚Äì A foul committed by a member of the team playing offense. * Technical foul ‚Äì A foul assessed for unsportsmanlike non-contact behavior and for some procedural violations (for example, having too many players on the floor or calling timeout when none remain). Penalized by loss of possession after a free throw which may be taken by any member of the opposing team. Frequently abbreviated as \\"technical\\" or \\"T.\\" * Unsportsmanlike conduct ‚Äì acting inappropriately or unprofessionally, such as fighting, verbal abuse, profanity, and flagrant fouls. An offender's team can be penalized by free throws being awarded to the other team followed by loss of possession, and upon repeated transgressions an offender can be ejected from the game.  Violations  Violation ‚Äì An infraction of the rules other than a foul, such as traveling or a three-second violation. * 24-second violation ‚Äì (NBAa, WNBA, FIBA) a shot-clock violation. * Basket interference ‚Äì violation involving any of the following:2009-2011 Men's & Women's Basketball Rules Rule 4, Section 5, Article 2.

The number varies by league as follows: ** NCAA men's and NFHS: All team fouls after the sixth in a half are considered to be \\"bonus\\" free throws in both rule sets. However, in popular usage, the \\"bonus\\" refers to the situation when the fouling team has seven, eight, or nine fouls in a half. In this situation, the team fouled is said to be \\"in the bonus\\" and so gains a one and one opportunity on each non-shooting foul by the defense. The opposing team is \\"over the limit.\\" See also double bonus and penalty. ** FIBA, NCAA women's: All team fouls after the fourth in a quarter are \\"bonus\\" fouls, with the non-fouling team receiving two free throws on non-shooting fouls by the defense. All overtime periods are considered an extension of the fourth quarter for purposes of accumulated team fouls. ** NBA and WNBA: Same as FIBA and NCAA women's, except that overtime is not considered an extension of any quarter. The bonus is triggered on the fourth team foul in an overtime period. Additionally, if a team has committed fewer than 4 fouls before the 2-minute mark of any period (including an overtime), its foul count is reset, and the bonus is triggered on the second team foul in the final 2 minutes. * Double bonus ‚Äì (NCAA men's and NFHS) when a team accumulates 10 or more fouls in a half, the other team is \\"in the double bonus\\", earning two free throws on each subsequent non-shooting foul by the defense. See also bonus and penalty. * Free throw ‚Äì a bonus awarded upon being fouled by a member of the opposing team, in which a player gets to stand at the free throw line unopposed and attempt to make a basket while everyone else is required to stand aside until the shot is over. In cases where more than one free throw is awarded, the other players must wait until after the last shot is executed before play resumes. * Penalty ‚Äì once a team reaches a set number of team fouls in a playing period, varying by governing body, the fouled team gets free throws instead of possession of the ball. The fouling team is \\"over the limit\\". See also bonus and double bonus. * One-and-one ‚Äì (NCAA men's and NFHS) A free- throw attempt which, if made, allows the player a second free-throw attempt. See also bonus. This rule also applied in NCAA women's play before the 2015‚Äì16 season. * Turnover ‚Äì A loss of possession.  Game play  = Participants =  Players  * Ball hog ‚Äì A player who does not pass the ball, and takes more shots then everyone else. * Bricklayer ‚Äì One who repeatedly shoots bricks (Misses). * Sixth man (or sixth woman) ‚Äì A player who does not start, but is generally the first person off the bench, and often has statistics comparable to those of starters. = Positions = Basketball positions Basketball position ‚Äì general location on the court which each player is responsible for. A player is generally described by the position (or positions) he or she plays, though the rules do not specify any positions. Positions are part of the strategy that has evolved for playing the game, and terminology for describing game play.  Primary positions  * Backcourt positions: ** Guard ‚Äì One of the three standard player positions. Today, guards are typically classified in two broad categories: *** Point guard ‚Äì has strong ballhandling and passing skills and is typically used to run the offense. *** Shooting guard ‚Äì as the name implies, are generally the team's best shooters, and are very often the leading scorers on their teams. * Frontcourt positions: ** Center ‚Äì One of the three standard player positions. Centers are generally the tallest players on the floor, responsible mainly for scoring, rebounding, and defense near the basket. *** Pivot ‚Äì Another name for center ** Forward ‚Äì One of the three standard player positions. Forwards are primarily responsible for scoring and rebounding. *** Power forward ‚Äì position that plays a role similar to that of center in what is called the \\"post\\" or \\"low blocks\\". Power forwards typically play offensively with their backs to the basket and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense. *** Small forward ‚Äì Typically smaller and quicker than power forwards, these players generally play on offense facing the basket, and very often attack the basket on offense. As with shooting guards, small forwards are often among their teams' leading scorers. Defensively, they will play on the perimeter of a zone defense, or against a physically similar opponent in a man-to-man.  Tweeners  Tweener ‚Äì a player who is able to play two positions, but is not ideally suited to play either position exclusively, so he/she is said to be in between. A tweener has a set of skills that do not match the traditional position of his or her physical stature. Tweeners include: * Combo guard ‚Äì Combines the features of both point guard and shooting guard. * Forward-center ‚Äì position for players who play or have played both forward and center on a consistent basis. Typically, this means power forward and center, since these are usually the two biggest player positions on any basketball team, and therefore more often overlap each other. * Point forward ‚Äì A forward with strong ballhandling and passing skills who can be called on to direct the team's offense. * Stretch four ‚Äì A player capable of playing either forward position. Term derived from the concept of a power forward (\\"4\\") capable of \\"stretching\\" a defense with outside shooting ability. * Swingman ‚Äì A player capable of playing either shooting guard or small forward.  Coaches  Coach ‚Äì * Basketball coach ‚Äì = Strategy = * Princeton offense ‚Äì an offensive strategy which emphasizes constant motion, passing, back-door cuts, and disciplined teamwork. It was used and perfected at Princeton University by Pete Carril, though its roots may be traced back to Franklin \\"Cappy\\" Cappon, who coached Princeton Tigers men's basketball in the late 1930s. * 1-3-1 defense/offense ‚Äì * Box-and-one defense ‚Äì A combination defense in which four defenders play zone in a box formation and the fifth defender guards one player man-to-man. * Continuity offense ‚Äì pattern of movement, cuts, screens and passes that eventually leads back to the starting formation, and repeats. ** Flex offense ‚Äì ** Shuffle offense ‚Äì * Hack-a-Shaq ‚Äì The strategy of intentionally and repeatedly committing a personal foul against an otherwise skilled player who shoots free throws poorly. \\"Shaq\\" refers to Shaquille O'Neal. * Jordan Rules ‚Äì * Man-to-man defense ‚Äì A defense in which each player guards a single opposing player. See also zone defense. * Motion offense ‚Äì Category of offense involving a series of cuts and screens to create the best possible shot, with most or all offensive players moving simultaneously. * Nellie ball ‚Äì a fast-paced offense relying on smaller, more athletic players who can outrun their opponents and make more three-point attempts. Developed by NBA head coach Don Nelson. This offense is most effective against teams that do not have the athleticism or shooting ability to keep up with the fast pace. * Pack-line defense ‚Äì A man-to-man defensive system in which one player pressures the ball and the other four players \\"pack\\" down within a \\"line\\" about 2 feet (0.6 m) inside the three-point arc, with the intent of stopping dribble penetration. * Run and gun ‚Äì combined offense and defense in which the team applies constant full-court pressure, while moving the ball forward as quickly as possible and taking the first available shot, often a three- pointer. ** Grinnell System ‚Äì A further development of this style, created by Grinnell College head coach David Arseneault. The most striking feature of this system is that entire five-player units are usually substituted every 45 to 90 seconds, in a manner similar to an ice hockey shift. * Shuffle offense ‚Äì * Small Ball ‚Äì A strategy based in putting shorter players on the playing court, generally non-interior (positions 4 and 5) players * Triangle offense ‚Äì An offensive strategy with the goal of exchanging three (sometimes all five) positions, creating spacing among players and allowing each one to pass to four teammates. Originally established by University of Southern California head coach Sam Barry, this offense was later refined and perfected by one of Barry's former players, prominent college and NBA coach Tex Winter. * Triangle and Two Defense ‚Äì Similar to a box-and-one, except that in this variation, three defenders (usually the frontcourt players) play zone in a triangular formation and the other two defenders (usually the guards) play man-to-man. * UCLA High Post Offense ‚Äì * Zone defense ‚Äì ** 2-3 Zone Defense ‚Äì  Plays  * Backdoor cut ‚Äì offensive play in which a player on the perimeter steps away from the basket, drawing the defender along, then suddenly cuts to the basket behind the defender for a pass.

See also bounce pass. * Alley oop ‚Äì An offensive play in which a player throws the ball up near the basket to a teammate (or, more rarely, to himself) who jumps, catches the ball in mid air and immediately scores a basket, usually with a slam dunk. * Euro step ‚Äì An offensive move in which a player, after picking up the dribble, takes a step in one direction and the second allowed step in a different direction while driving to the rim. * Field goal ‚Äì A shot made from anywhere on the court, does not include free throws. * Over the back ‚Äì a foul committed by a player who tries to rebound the ball by pushing, moving or climbing on a player's back who is already in position to rebound the ball. * Rebound ‚Äì To obtain the ball after a missed field goal attempt.  Blocking and footwork  * Banana cut ‚Äì A wide, curving cut, as opposed to a cut that is a straight line. * Basket cut ‚Äì A cut toward the basket. * Blindside screen ‚Äì A screen set directly behind a defender where the player can't see it. * Block ‚Äì To tip or deflect a shooter's shot, altering its flight so the shot misses.* Block out ‚Äì To make contact with an opposing player to establish rebounding position between the player and the ball.

Pivot towards the defender and rips the ball in a C-shape away from the pressure to create a passing lane. * screen, set a screen ‚Äì (v) To attempt to prevent a defender from guarding a teammate by standing in the defender's way. The screening player must remain stationary: a moving screen is an offensive foul. (n) The tactic of setting a screen. Also called a \\"pick\\". * Stutter step ‚Äì a common warm-up drill where you shuffle and scuff your feet in a quick moving motion across a length of flooring. This warm-up is supposed to keep the players alert and help them prepare to defend players in a real game, since the stutter step is a smaller version of shuffling.  Dribbling  Dribble ‚Äì to bounce the ball continuously. Required in order to take steps with the ball. * Wraparound ‚Äì In the wraparound, the ballhandler dribbles the ball behind his/her back, switching it to his/her other hand. This move can be used when the defender attempts a steal, allowing the ballhandler to begin moving forward as the defense moves in. A streetball move with the same name involves swinging the ball around the opponent's body. * Spin move ‚Äì In a spin move, the ballhandler spins his/her body to change the direction and put his body between the ball and the defender. The spin move can be used while dribbling (when it is also called a reverse pivot) or in a post position, where it is often used many times during a game. The move can also leave the ballhandler somewhat disoriented, or to be surprised by a defender after losing eye contact. * Crossover dribble ‚Äì In a crossover dribble, the ballhandler changes pace to confuse or freeze a defender. It is also used to put the defender off balance to make it easier for the player handling the ball to dribble past the defender. The move is often performed by street players. In the professional league, players like Allen Iverson, Jason Williams, and Tim Hardaway were known to use this move in order to generate an easy layup or jump shot. This move is most effective in open-court situations, where it is easy to shake or \\"juke\\" the defender with a simple crossover. If done properly, the defender will be caught off guard, being unable to change directions. Sometimes, the defender falls down; this is called an ankle breaker. * Behind-the-back dribble ‚Äì A basic move in which the ballhandler simply bounces the ball behind the back to the opposite hand, but note that the ball is not intended to go around the body as in the basic 'wraparound'. This move is used to avoid an easy strip, to 'stall', or to 'pick'. It can be used to avoid an easy strip as an alternative to bouncing the ball in front of the dribbler for a tricky crossover. To stall means to overlook what can be set up on the court while still maintaining control over the ball. A pick is virtually the same as a stall but a pick is continuous, meaning that the ball is bounced back and forth behind the back; a pick may also be performed between the legs. The best choice of when to use this move would be in the case of a teammate's unavailability, to outrun a defender, or to drive the ball closer to the hoop due to the lack of space between the ballhandler and defender.  Passes  Pass ‚Äì (v) To throw the ball to a teammate. (n) The act of passing. * Assist ‚Äì A pass to a teammate who scores a basket immediately or after one dribble. * Ball fake ‚Äì A sudden movement by the player with the ball intended to cause the defender to move in one direction, allowing the passer to pass in another direction. Also called \\"pass fake.\\" * Ball reversal ‚Äì Passing of the ball from one side of the court to the other. * Baseball pass ‚Äì Also called the lance pass, this is a long pass in which the passer throws the ball with one hand, as if it were a baseball or a football. It is infrequently used, mainly to set up last-second plays off a baseline inbounding situation. * Behind-the-back ‚Äì Dealt to a target behind the passer's back. Usually done to confuse the defender, behind the back passes can either be bounced off the floor or passed directly to a teammate's chest. However, most behind-the-back passes are direct. Earl Monroe was famous for this move. Steve Nash uses this move often, and Chris Webber is famed for using this move down in the paint. * Blind pass ‚Äì Also known as a no-look pass, the blind pass is performed when a player looks in one direction but passes the ball to his target in another direction. Blind passes are risky and infrequently attempted, but when done correctly, can confuse the defense. The no-look pass has been popularized by players such as Pete Maravich, Isiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Jason Kidd and Steve Nash. * Bounce pass ‚Äì A fundamental passing technique that consists of one player passing the ball to a teammate by bouncing the ball off the floor with great energy. Because the ball will be at ground level as it passes a defender, a successful bounce pass can easily result in a scoring assist because a bounce pass is harder for defenders to intercept. Still, a bounce pass may be intercepted due to its slower speed. Thus, a player must use his best judgment when he decides whether to make such a pass. The move has to be executed perfectly because a bounce pass may be kicked by rapidly shifting players and might be a difficult catch for the intended receiver. * Chest pass ‚Äì This pass is performed best by stepping towards your target with one foot, then throwing the ball out towards their chest with two hands while turning the hands over, ending with the thumbs pointing down. It is best used in the open court and on the perimeter. * Dime ‚Äì See drop a dime. * Dish ‚Äì An assist. * Drop a dime ‚Äì To make an assist * Elbow pass ‚Äì Introduced with much hype by Jason Williams, the Elbow Pass is one of the most difficult trick passes to execute. The Elbow Pass serves as a devastating complement to the Behind-the-Back pass and can be used with various no-look elements. Most effective on a fast-break, the Elbow Pass entails what appears to the defender to be a simple Behind-the-Back pass, but as the ball crosses the passer's back, the passer hits it with his elbow, redirecting the ball back toward the side it started on and hopefully leaving the defender(s) amazed and out of position. Williams was able to pull off this pass at a full sprint during a Rookie All-Star game, but most players have trouble hitting the ball with their elbow while standing still. * Jump pass ‚Äì A pass performed while the passing player's feet are off the floor. When done intentionally, usually when a teammate gets open during the shot, it can sometimes confuse the defender, causing him to believe that the passer is shooting instead of passing. However, it at times is done as a result of the player having their shooting lane blocked and often leads to the player turning the ball over to the opposing team. This kind of pass is strongly discouraged in all levels of basketball, as it leaves the offensive player very vulnerable to turnovers. * Outlet pass ‚Äì A pass thrown by a rebounder to start a fast break. * Overhead pass ‚Äì another fundamental passing technique, used by snapping the ball over the head, like a soccer throw-in. This pass is especially effective in helping to initiate a fast break. After a defensive rebound, a well-thrown overhead, or outlet, pass can allow a breaking offensive player to quickly score without even dribbling by catching the ball near the basket.

Depending on the specifics of the foul and the rule set, one or two attempts may be awarded for technical fouls. * Hook shot ‚Äì A shot in which the offensive player arcs the ball over his head using the farthest hand from the basket, while moving perpendicular to the basket. * In- n-out ‚Äì A shot that appears to be going in, but instead goes back out. * Jump shot ‚Äì A shot taken while jumping * Lay-in ‚Äì A close-range shot using one hand to tip the ball over the rim * Layup ‚Äì A close-range shot using one hand to bank the ball off the backboard * Points in the paint ‚Äì Field goals made in the painted area below the free-throw line * Prayer ‚Äì A shot that has very little probability of being made. * Set shot ‚Äì A shot taken without leaving the floor. * Slam dunk ‚Äì A shot performed with the player jumping in air and forces the ball into the rim with one or both hands. * Swish ‚Äì (n) A shot which goes through the net without hitting the backboard or rim.

He published three books: Magnetostatic Principles in Ferromagnetism, Micromagnetics, and Magnetoelastic Interactions. Biography William Fuller Brown Jr. was born in Lyon Mountain, New York on September 21, 1904 to William Fuller Brown and Marie E. Williams. An early interest in electromagnetism was stimulated by a toy motor but \\"destimulated\\" by high school and college physics courses. He graduated from Cornell University with a BA in English in 1925 and began teaching at Carolina Academy, a private high school in Raleigh, North Carolina. This \\"restimulated\\" his interest in physics. In 1927, Brown enrolled in Columbia University. With S. L. Quimby as his doctoral advisor, he wrote a dissertation on the effect of magnetization on the elastic properties of iron. On August 17, 1936 he was married to Shannon Johnson. He received his PhD in physics in 1937. In 1938 Brown was appointed assistant professor of physics at Princeton University. It was during this period that he developed micromagnetics. In 1941, he went to the U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory, where he headed a team that was working on methods to protect ships against magnetic mines. He developed novel methods for degaussing ships and instrumentation for measuring magnetic fields and the magnetic properties of steels. For his work he was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award by the U.S. Navy. From 1946 to 1955, Brown worked in Newton Square, Pennsylvania as a research physicist at the Sun Oil Company, investigating dielectric and ferromagnetic phenomena. In 1955 he moved to Minnesota and worked with the 3M Company as a senior research physicist, where there was a strong interest in ferromagnetic single-domain particles. In 1957 Brown became a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Minnesota. He remained in this position until he became emeritus in 1973, aside from 1962 (when he was a Fulbright scholar at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel) and 1963-1964 (when he was guest professor at the Max Planck Institute for Metals Research in Stuttgart). He died in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1983. Development of micromagnetics At the time of Brown's graduation from Cornell, the theory for magnetic domains was not very developed. Richard Becker and Werner D√∂ring, in their book Ferromagnetismus, emphasized internal stresses. Brown realized that the most important factor, magnetostatic forces, were \\"totally ignored\\". He was strongly influenced by the 1935 paper of Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, which developed a one-dimensional continuous model for domain wall motion. In 1938 W. C. Elmore published a paper that discussed a three-dimensional generalization of the Landau-Lifshitz theory, but did not attempt to derive the equations. Brown set out to do this. Brown published his equations in 1940 and applied them to the approach to saturation of magnetization curves. He later said that \\"nobody paid any attention to them for 16 years\\", although Charles Kittel said that it was one of the \\"starting points\\" for his review of ferromagnetism in 1946. Honors In 1967, Brown received an A. Cressy Morrison Award from the New York Academy of Sciences. In 1968 he was elected Fellow of the IEEE and in 1974 was made an Honorary Life Member of the IEEE Magnetics Society. He was also elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1938 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

He also played one season in the National Basketball Association. Early life Parkinson grew up in Yorktown, Indiana and attended Yorktown High School. A two-sport star, he earned varsity letters in baseball and basketball for all four years. In 1941‚Äì42, Parkinson's senior year, he led Delaware County in scoring for basketball and hit .500 in baseball. He also threw a no-hitter during the county baseball championship match. Parkinson was offered a contract by Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds, but his desire to play basketball for legendary Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball coach Adolph Rupp was so strong that he passed up a professional baseball opportunity to play for him. College and professional Parkinson earned four varsity letters as a member of the Kentucky men's basketball team in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). He played for Rupp from 1943‚Äì44 through 1945‚Äì46 and again in 1947‚Äì48; during what would have been his true senior season, Parkinson was overseas for 11 months after enlisting in the Army. As a freshman in 1943‚Äì44, he helped lead the Wildcats to a 19‚Äì2 overall record and win both the SEC regular season and tournament championships. He was named to the All-SEC First Team and All-SEC Tournament Team. In 1944‚Äì45, the Wildcats once again were SEC regular season and tournament champions. Parkinson earned his second All-SEC First Team and All-Tournament Team honors while helping the team earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament. They finished the season with a 22‚Äì4 record. Parkinson's best collegiate season came as a junior in 1945‚Äì46. He averaged 11.3 points per game, earned his third consecutive All-SEC First Team and All-SEC Tournament Team selections while leading the Wildcats to yet more championships, and ultimately led them to win their first-ever NIT. They finished the season 30‚Äì2 and edged Rhode Island, 46‚Äì45, in the NIT championship game. Parkinson was named a consensus Second Team All-American as well. After the school year ended, he spent an 11-month stint in the Army, which put off his college career by one season. When Parkinson returned in 1947‚Äì48 for his senior season, he found himself relegated to coming off of the bench rather than starting, something which he had done for his whole career. He was playing behind what came to be known as Kentucky's \\"Fab Five\\" of Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, Cliff Barker, Kenny Rollins and Wallace \\"Wah Wah\\" Jones, which is one of Kentucky's most famous all-time teams. Kentucky would go on to win the SEC regular season and tournament as well as the 1948 NCAA Championship, but Parkinson's role in the success was greatly reduced from two years prior. Despite this, he would end his career with a distinguished collection of championships and accolades, including: * 1946 NIT champion * 1946 Consensus second-team All-American * 1948 NCAA champion *3√ó First-team All-Southeastern Conference *3√ó All-SEC Tournament team *4√ó SEC regular season champion *4√ó SEC Tournament champion *851 career points in 106 games (8.02 ppg) *105‚Äì11 overall record in Parkinson's four seasons Jack Parkinson was selected in the 1949 BAA Draft by the Washington Capitols. He did not play in the league until , however, as a member of the Indianapolis Olympians. In only four career games, Parkinson scored three points. In addition to his brief NBA career, he also played with the Whiskered Wizards basketball team of St. Augustine, Florida, and with the Toledo Mercurys, who traveled with the Harlem Globetrotters. Later life Parkinson returned to Yorktown, Indiana and opened a wholesale plumbing and heating business in Muncie. He was elected into the Delaware County Athletic Hall of Fame and the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. His son, Bruce G. Parkinson, was an All-American as a player at Purdue and still holds the school's record for career assists (690). Bruce led the Boilermakers to the 1974 NIT Championship and was the Captain of the 1975 Pan-Am Gold Medal Men's Basketball Team.

The film is an early example of the plot premise which would prove very popular in the British silent film canon: that of a character (almost always a pretty young girl) from the working-class East End of London being suddenly thrust by circumstance into the daunting milieu of West End high society. The full print of East Is East survives, and is well regarded by historians of British silent film. Writing for the British Film Institute, Bryony Dixon notes: \\"Edwards seems to have had an innate or instinctive understanding of cinema space both as an actor and director, and despite being hampered as everyone else at that early date by rather fixed sets and camera positions, he uses himself and the other actors to convey the space beyond the fourth wall, creating the illusion of a satisfyingly convincing world.\\" She also notes: \\"The locations are well chosen and evocative of a bygone era, particularly the lovely scenes in the Kentish hop fields\\", and that Edith Evans in a very early screen role \\"outrageously upstages everyone at every opportunity\\".East Is East Dixon, Bryony. BFI Screen Online. Retrieved 05-10-2010 Although largely a serious drama, the film also includes scenes of visual humour arising from the awkward collision of East End and West End manners and habits. Plot Victoria Vickers (Turner) lives with her aunt and uncle in Poplar and is being courted by Bert Grummett (Edwards), who aspires to one day marry Victoria and open up his own fish and chip shop. For the time being, Victoria is happy for them just to remain friends. The Vickers family and Bert go off on their annual summer jaunt to pick hops in Kent. Unknown to them, Victoria is being desperately sought by a solicitor to pass on the good news that she has inherited a fortune from the estate of a recently deceased distant relative. There is a deadline for her to claim her bounty, but happily the solicitor tracks her down in Kent in the nick of time and rushes her back to London. Under an unusual proviso in the will, Victoria must spend three years under the guidance of a society guardian in order to acquire the social polish and sophistication to go with her new wealth. She is sent to live with the wealthy Mrs. Carrington (Ruth Mackay) and her son, but quickly starts to find the high life more restrictive and dreary than she had bargained for. She is thrilled to receive a visit from Bert, but Mrs. Carrington is appalled by his lack of savoir faire and decides to send Victoria abroad for two years to finish her transformation away from Bert's poor influence. Before she is packed off, Victoria lends Bert a sum of money. Victoria returns to London when the two years are up, now to all outward appearances the finished article. Bert meanwhile has used the money wisely to build up a thriving and profitable business. Now prosperous and respectable, he calls to repay the loan to Victoria, who admits that she is stifled in her new life and wishes she could return to her former East End happiness but in the circumstances does not think it possible. She subsequently accepts a surprise marriage proposal from the Carrington son. Bert reads of Victoria's engagement in a newspaper, and is so upset that he decides to retire from active business and buys a cottage in the Kent countryside, to which he withdraws in solitude. On the night of her engagement party, Victoria overhears her fianc√© telling a female acquaintance that the only reason he wants to marry her is to get his hands on her money to pay off large gambling debts. Horrified, she announces that she intends to break the engagement and give up her claim to the fortune, as she has realised that high society is not for her. She returns to Poplar to look for Bert but cannot find him. She travels to Kent, feeling nostalgic for the carefree times she spent there. She happens to pass Bert's cottage and he spots her from his window. He rushes out to her and they are reunited with the promise of a happy future together.

Early years Cameron was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Cathy (n√©e Cravens) and Stan Cameron, who works for a telecommunications company. He was raised Mormon (LDS). Cameron attended Newbury Park High School in Newbury Park, California. He made the All-Marmonte League first team in 2005 as a junior. As a senior in 2006, he made Prep Star All-West and once again made All-Marmonte League first team. He caught 73 passes for 1,022 yards and 12 touchdowns in his senior year. He was a teammate of former San Jose State' quarterback, Jordan LaSecla. He also starred in basketball and volleyball at Newbury Park High. Collegiate career Cameron at USC After high school, Cameron decided to play basketball at Brigham Young University rather than football. After redshirting his freshman year (2006‚Äì07), he decided to give football another try. He transferred to USC in 2007 to play football as a wide receiver.2007 USC Trojans Football Media Guide (Section 3), USC Athletic Department, July 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008. However, when USC refused to accept some of Cameron's credits from Brigham Young, he was forced to withdraw and attend Ventura College. He missed the football season but was given the option to try to rejoin the team in 2008. Even if he had stayed at USC, due to NCAA transfer rules he would have been ineligible to play in 2007. Cameron ended up enrolling at USC a year later and saw brief action for the Trojans at wide receiver in both the 2008 and 2009 seasons, but did not make any catches. Prior to his senior year, he embraced a move from receiver to tight end. In his final season at USC, Cameron caught 16 passes for 126 yards and a touchdown. Professional career =Pre-draft= After his senior season at USC, Cameron was invited to play in the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game where he made a big impression on the coaches during the week of practice. Cameron helped his draft stock significantly during his workouts at the NFL Combine. He was in the top three of every drill he participated in and fifth in bench press reps.

SS Pollux was built in 1909 at Rotterdam, the Netherlands, by Werf voorheen Rijkee N. V. as a commercial cargo ship for KNSM The Royal Netherlands Steamship Company or De Konninklijke Nederlandsche Stoomboot-Maatschappij, a major Dutch shipping company at the time. SS Pollux was one of six very similar ships built for KNSM with SS Clio (USS Clio - ID-2578) built by Rijkee at Rotterdam in 1910, SS Saturnus built by Mij Fijenoord in Rotterdam in 1909 along with SS Mercurius (USS Mercurius - ID 2516), SS Minerva, and SS Stella built by William Hamilton & Co. Ltd. in Glasgow Scotland in 1909. During World War I, which began in 1914 and ended in 1918, the Netherlands was a neutral power. This meant that Dutch ships could not be used to support either side in the conflict. When the United States entered the war on 6 April 1917, the pressure increased on the Netherlands to allow their ships to be used, but they were not in a position to do this without risking German retaliation. Finally, on 20 and 21 March 1918, the U.S. and the British simply seized all the Dutch ships in their ports and justified it with the legal concept of the 'right of angary'. A total of 135 Dutch ships were seized including Pollux and two of her sister ships: Clio and Mercurius. The U.S. Navy acquired Pollux for World War I service from her owners, Koninklijke Nederlandsche Stoomboot-Maatschappij of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on 20 March 1918 and commissioned her at Key West on 3 April 1918 as USS Pollux (SP-2573), with Lieutenant Commander Geert Scheltens, USNRF, in command. Manned by a skeleton crew of available sailors, Pollux departed Key West on 6 April 1918 for Cuba, where she took on board sugar at Havana, C√°rdenas, and Matanzas. She arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 22 April 1918 with 25,000 bags of sugar for the American Sugar Refinery Company, then began preparations for inactivation. The Navy decommissioned Pollux and turned her over to the United States Shipping Board on 24 April 1918 for further use during World War I. She was returned to her owners in 1919. In 1931 Pollux was renamed Tabarka. On 23 March 1941 Tabarka was sunk as a blockship in Scapa Flow.

The four-act play, set in 1830s St. Petersburg aristocratic society, highlights the rebellious spirit and noble mind of the protagonist, Yevgeny Arbenin. It is often compared with Shakespeare's Othello in its essential story line. Plot The hero of the drama, Arbenin, is a wealthy middle-aged man endowed with a rebellious spirit and a strong will. Born into high society, he strives in vain to gain independence and freedom. He lives by the laws of his society, and, in trying to defend his honor while blinded by jealousy and pride, ends up murdering his wife. =Act I= Act I opens with Arbenin playing cards with Prince Zvezdich, and losing. Arbenin recoups his losses and gives the money back to Prince Zvezdich. From there the pair go to a masquerade party also being attended by Arbenin's wife, Nina. Zvezdich flirts with a dissolute lady, a baroness who is a friend of Nina. But because of the masks Zvezdich does not know who she is. The mystery lady gives Zvezdich her bracelet as a memento - a bracelet that had once belonged to Nina. Arbenin later notices the bracelet missing from his wife's wrist, recalls it in Zvezdich's possession, and concludes that his wife has been cheating on him with Zvezdich. =Act II= In Act II, Nina meets with the baroness. Prince Zvezdich confronts Nina with a hint about her bracelet. The Baroness, who in love with Prince Zvezdich, decides to spread the rumors that Nina and Prince Zvezdich are in love. Arbenin reads a letter from Zvezdich addressed to Nina, which leads him to further to believe that the woman behind the mask was his wife Nina. He becomes enraged, and is convinced that all St. Petersburg knows of his wife's disloyalty. Arbenin first resolves to stab Zvezdich, but considering this a too mild punishment that would not restore his honor, he considers exacting a more thorough revenge on Zvezdich and Nina. =Act III= In Act III, Arbenin mixes poison (which he had obtained years earlier after a financial setback, but never taken) into his wife's ice cream at a ball. The scene moves to the couple's bedroom, where Arbenin explains what he has done, and why. He loves her madly but, blinded by jealousy, is unable to hear the cries and protestations of innocence of his fatally poisoned wife. =Act IV= In Act IV, Nina is dead. Zvezdich and a character called The Unknown come to Arbenin, both wanting revenge. They bring him a letter from the baroness proving Nina's innocence. Arbenin, realizing that he has murdered his beloved wife without cause, goes insane. =Conclusions= The audience is, however, led to the conclusion is that Arbenin is not the only guilty party in Nina's death. The baroness and other players, with motives of their own, did not always tell the truth, allowing Arbenin's delusion to continue or indeed abetting it. Thus the meaning of the play's title, \\"Masquerade\\", may be taken in more than one way. The play contains several monologues which serve as standalone speeches. History of the play =First version= The play was written in 1835. The original version is a three-act play that ends with the death of Nina. Lermontov, hoping to see the play produced, presented it to the office of the literary censor, which at that time was under the chief of Section Three (the secret police), Alexander von Benckendorff. The censor did not approve the play, telling Lermontov that the passions displayed were too severe and that the play implied criticism of the masked balls held by the house of Engelhardt, an aristocratic family. The drama was returned to Lermontov for correction. =Second version= Wishing to avoid radical changes in the text, Lermontov added a fourth act and introduced a new character, The Unknown. This allowed Lermontov to show Arbenin being punished for his deeds. =Third version= Still the censor did not approve the play. Lermontov then undertook a major redaction of the play, including a title change from \\"Masquerade\\" to \\"Arbenin\\". But even in this crippled form, the play did not satisfy the censor, and the play was not produced in Lermontov's lifetime. The only version of the play that has survived is the second four-act one. Masquerade was finally staged in 1852 at the Aleksandrinsky Theater as a benefit for the actress Maria Valberhova, whom Lermontov had envisioned as Nina, although only certain scenes could be staged. Censorship of the play was lifted completely in 1862. Perhaps the real reason that the play was not allowed to be staged is that it is based on a real incident. This is evidenced by the fact that Nina is called by the more formal name Nastasia Pavlovna - only once in the entire play, but through all versions and alterations. This was presumably a hint to the audience.

The concept is applicable to matters of fame or status, but may also be applied literally to cumulative advantage of economic capital. In the beginning, Matthew effects were primarily focused on the inequality in the way scientists were recognized for their work. However, Norman Storer, of Columbia University, led a new wave of research. He believed he discovered that the inequality that existed in the social sciences also existed in other institutions.Rigney, Daniel (2010). \\"MATTHEW EFFECTS IN THE ECONOMY.‚Äù The Matthew Effect: How Advantage Begets Further Advantage. Columbia University Press. pp. pp. 35‚Äì52. The term was coined by sociologist Robert K. Merton in 1968 and takes its name from the parable of the talents or minas in the biblical Gospel of Matthew. Merton credited his collaborator and wife, sociologist Harriet Zuckerman, as co-author of the concept of the Matthew effect. Etymology The concept is named according to two of the parables of Jesus in the synoptic Gospels (Table 2, of the Eusebian Canons). The concept concludes both synoptic versions of the parable of the talents: The concept concludes two of the three synoptic versions of the parable of the lamp under a bushel (absent in the version of Matthew): The concept is presented again in Matthew outside of a parable during Christ's explanation to his disciples of the purpose of parables: Sociology of science In the sociology of science, \\"Matthew effect\\" was a term coined by Robert K. Merton to describe how, among other things, eminent scientists will often get more credit than a comparatively unknown researcher, even if their work is similar; it also means that credit will usually be given to researchers who are already famous. For example, a prize will almost always be awarded to the most senior researcher involved in a project, even if all the work was done by a graduate student. This was later formulated by Stephen Stigler as Stigler's law of eponymy ‚Äì \\"No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer\\" ‚Äì with Stigler explicitly naming Merton as the true discoverer, making his \\"law\\" an example of itself. Merton furthermore argued that in the scientific community the Matthew effect reaches beyond simple reputation to influence the wider communication system, playing a part in social selection processes and resulting in a concentration of resources and talent. He gave as an example the disproportionate visibility given to articles from acknowledged authors, at the expense of equally valid or superior articles written by unknown authors. He also noted that the concentration of attention on eminent individuals can lead to an increase in their self-assurance, pushing them to perform research in important but risky problem areas. =Examples= As credit is valued in science, specific claims of the Matthew effect are contentious. Many examples below exemplify more famous scientists getting credit for discoveries due to their fame, even as other less notable scientists had preempted their work. *Experiments manipulating download counts or bestseller lists for books and music have shown consumer activity follows the apparent popularity. * In algorithmic information theory, the notion of Kolmogorov complexity is named after the famous mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov even though it was independently discovered and published by Ray Solomonoff a year before Kolmogorov. Li and Vitanyi, in \\"An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications\\" (p. 84), write: : Ray Solomonoff ... introduced [what is now known as] \\"Kolmogorov complexity\\" in a long journal paper in 1964. ... This makes Solomonoff the first inventor and raises the question whether we should talk about Solomonoff complexity. ... * There are many uncontroversial examples of the Matthew effect in mathematics, where a concept is due to one mathematician (and well-documented as such), but is attributed to a later (possibly much later), more famous mathematician who worked on it. For instance, the Poincar√© disk model and Poincar√© half-plane model of hyperbolic space are both named for Henri Poincar√©, but were introduced by Eugenio Beltrami in 1868 (when Poincar√© was 14 and had not as yet contributed to hyperbolic geometry). * A model for career progress quantitatively incorporates the Matthew Effect in order to predict the distribution of individual career length in competitive professions. The model predictions are validated by analyzing the empirical distributions of career length for careers in science and professional sports (e.g. Major League Baseball). As a result, the disparity between the large number of short careers and the relatively small number of extremely long careers can be explained by the \\"rich-get-richer\\" mechanism, which in this framework, provides more experienced and more reputable individuals with a competitive advantage in obtaining new career opportunities. * In his 2011 book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker refers to the Matthew Effect in societies, whereby everything seems to go right in some, and wrong in others. He speculates in Chapter 9 that this could be the result of a positive feedback loop in which reckless behavior by some individuals creates a chaotic environment that encourages reckless behavior by others. He cites research by Martin Daly and Margo Wilson showing that the more unstable the environment, the more steeply people discount the future, and thus the less forward-looking their behavior. * A large Matthew effect was discovered in a study of science funding in the Netherlands, where winners just above the funding threshold were found to accumulate more than twice as much funding during the subsequent eight years as non-winners with near-identical review scores that fell just below the threshold. In science, dramatic differences in the productivity may be explained by three phenomena: sacred spark, cumulative advantage, and search costs minimization by journal editors. The sacred spark paradigm suggests that scientists differ in their initial abilities, talent, skills, persistence, work habits, etc. that provide particular individuals with an early advantage. These factors have a multiplicative effect which helps these scholars succeed later. The cumulative advantage model argues that an initial success helps a researcher gain access to resources (e.g., teaching release, best graduate students, funding, facilities, etc.), which in turn results in further success. Search costs minimization by journal editors takes place when editors try to save time and effort by consciously or subconsciously selecting articles from well-known scholars. Whereas the exact mechanism underlying these phenomena is yet unknown, it is documented that a minority of all academics produce the most research output and attract the most citations. Education In education, the term \\"Matthew effect\\" has been adopted by psychologist Keith Stanovich to describe a phenomenon observed in research on how new readers acquire the skills to read: early success in acquiring reading skills usually leads to later successes in reading as the learner grows, while failing to learn to read before the third or fourth year of schooling may be indicative of lifelong problems in learning new skills. This is because children who fall behind in reading would read less, increasing the gap between them and their peers. Later, when students need to \\"read to learn\\" (where before they were learning to read), their reading difficulty creates difficulty in most other subjects. In this way they fall further and further behind in school, dropping out at a much higher rate than their peers. In the words of Stanovich: The Matthew effect plays a role in today's educational system. Students around the United States participate in the SAT every year to then send those scores to the colleges to which they are applying. The distributor of the SAT, the College board, conducted a study based on the income earned by the families of the test takers. The results showed the Matthew effect is prevalent when it comes to a family's economic earnings: \\"Students from families earning more than $200,000 a year average a combined score of 1,714, while students from families earning under $20,000 a year average a combined score of 1,326.\\"Goldfarb, Zachary. ‚ÄúThese Four Charts Show How the SAT Favors Rich, Educated Families.‚Äù The Washington Post, WP Company, 26 Apr. 2019, www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/05/these-four-charts-show-how-the- sat-favors-the-rich-educated-families/./ Not only do students with a wealthier family score better, but statistics show that students with parents that have accomplished more in school perform better as well. A student with a parent with a graduate degree, for example, averages 300 points higher on their SAT compared to a student with a parent with only a high school degree.Goldfarb, Zachary. ‚ÄúThese Four Charts Show How the SAT Favors Rich, Educated Families.‚Äù The Washington Post, WP Company, 26 Apr. 2019, www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/05/these-four-charts-show-how-the- sat-favors-the-rich-educated-families/.  Network science  In network science, the Matthew effect is used to describe the preferential attachment of earlier nodes in a network, which explains that these nodes tend to attract more links early on. \\"Because of preferential attachment, a node that acquires more connections than another one will increase its connectivity at a higher rate, and thus an initial difference in the connectivity between two nodes will increase further as the network grows, while the degree of individual nodes will grow proportional with the square root of time.\\" The Matthew Effect therefore explains the growth of some nodes in vast networks such as the Internet.  Markets with social influence  Social influence often induces a rich-get-richer phenomenon where popular products tend to become even more popular. An example of the Matthew Effect's role on social influence. Salganik, Dodds, and Watts created an experimental virtual market named MUSICLAB. In MUSICLAB, people could listen to music and choose to download the songs they enjoyed the most. The song choices were unknown songs produced by unknown bands. There were two groups tested; one group was given zero additional information on the songs and one group was told the popularity of each song and the number of times it had previously been downloaded.Berbeglia, Franco, and Pascal Van Hentenryck. Taming the Matthew Effect in Online Markets with Social Influence. Taming the Matthew Effect in Online Markets with Social Influence. As a result, the group that saw which songs were the most popular and were downloaded the most were then biased to choose those songs as well. The songs that were most popular and downloaded the most stayed at the top of the list and consistently received the most plays. To summarize the experiments findings, the performance rankings had the largest effect boosting expected downloads the most. Download rankings had a decent effect; however, not as impactful as the performance rankings.Salganik, Matthew J., et al. Experimental Study of Inequality and Unpredictability in an Artificial Cultural Market. 2006, pp. 1‚Äì15, Experimental Study of Inequality and Unpredictability in an Artificial Cultural Market. Also, Abeliuk et al. (2016) proved that when utilizing ‚Äúperformance rankings‚Äù, a monopoly will be created for the most popular songs.Abeliuk, Andr√©s, et al. ‚ÄúThe Benefits of Social Influence in Optimized Cultural Markets.‚Äù Plos One, vol. 10, no. 4, 2015, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0121934.  Political science  Liberalization in autocracies is more likely to succeed in countries with the advantage of a better starting point concerning political institutions, GDP, and education. These more privileged countries can also carry out key reforms more rapidly, and are able to do so even in areas with no initial advantage.

The Hospital opened in 1851 in Stockton, California and closed 1995-1996. The site is currently used as the Stockton campus of California State University, Stanislaus. History It was constructed as the Insane Asylum of California at Stockton in 1851. It was on of land donated by Captain Charles Maria Weber. The legislature at the time felt that existing hospitals were incapable of caring for the large numbers of people who suffered from mental and emotional conditions as a result of the California Gold Rush, and authorized the creation of the first public mental health hospital in California.

A Study in the Psychology of Acting is an 1888 book by William Archer. It is based on a series of articles entitled ‚ÄúThe Anatomy of Acting‚Äù that he had previously published in Longman's Magazine.Archer, Charles. William Archer, Life, Work and Friendships. London: G. Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1931. Print.  History  Archer intended his study to discredit Denis Diderot‚Äôs 18th-century work Paradoxe sur le Comedi√©n which had just been translated into English some five years before. Diderot maintained that masterful acting must not include emotional involvement on the part of the actor. This style of acting, reliant on physical technique over emotional truth, was still much in vogue in the late 19th century, particularly in France. The Paradoxe was also the subject of an ongoing debate between Henry Irving, Britain's most prominent actor, and Beno√Æt-Constant Coquelin, who was the leading actor of the Comedi√© Fran√ßaise. In order to make his case, Archer circulated a series of questions to as many professional actors as were willing. Many British actors refused or even derided the project. Prominent French critics refused to help him which severely limited his access to actors on the Continent. Some actors did help. Among them were Janet Achurch, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Arthur Wing Pinero, and Tommaso Salvini. Archer collected, analyzed, and presented their answers in his work, along with a survey of testimony of famous actors in history, including Edward Alleyn, David Garrick, Thomas Betterton, and William Charles Macready.  Conclusions  Some of the conclusions of Archer's research included: * While it is possible for an actor to sometimes affect an audience without being personally affected, a higher level of performance can be achieved through personal investment. * Actors regularly report that emotions whose source remains outside the world of the play can positively affect the performance without causing the loss of control Diderot objects to. * Laughter, a behavior notoriously difficult to mimic, can often be inspired in an actor playing a role multiple times. * An actor is capable of sustaining multiple threads of consciousness, and can simultaneously be aware of the realities of stage business while truly experiencing the emotion of the play. For this reason, an actor playing Othello can both attempt to strangle Iago and refrain from causing the fellow actor bodily harm.  Influence  Masks or Faces ultimately failed to put debate over Diderot completely to rest, but it did reinvigorate it. It also served as a key step in his campaign to bring both psychological realism and the plays of Henrik Ibsen to the British theatre. William James referenced The Anatomy of Acting as a particularly apt analysis of actors' emotions in his Principles of Psychology.James, William. Principles of Psychology v. 2 New York: Holt, 1890. p. 464. One of Archer's few foreign respondents, Tommaso Salvini, also served as one inspiration for Constantin Stanislavski in the development of his System of acting.Stanislavsky, Konstantin.

Biography Rivers was born in Los Angeles on March 19, 1892 to Andrew Ybarra. He was a fourth generation Californian. He was of Spanish-Indian descent. On February 22, 1911, he defeated Jimmy Reagan, a former Bantamweight World Champion by a technical knockout in the thirteenth round of a scheduled twenty. Reagan took a \\"terrific beating\\" and was knocked down four times prior to the thirteenth round when he was knocked down twice more by Rivers before the fight was called by Referee Eyeton. The bout took place in the Arena in Vernon, California, in Los Angeles County. The referee was Charles Eyton.\\"Young Rivers Gets Decision\\", The Washington Post, Washington, D.C., pg. 8, 23 February 1911\\"Jimmy Reagan Takes a Tremendous Beating\\", Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City, Utah, p. 11, 23 February 1911 On January 1, 1912 he knocked out former World Bantameight Champion Frankie Conley. At the time, Rivers was described 'as fast as chain lightning, and a stinging puncher to boot', and 'is a Mexican. His appearance tells that, but his accent does not differ from that of any other American stripling. He is a product of the Los Angeles fight game, and is probably the best youngster they have turned out down that way.' Annecdotally, he was 'christened Ybbarranda, or some other Mexican patronym with the customary deckload of Y's and R's' when asked his name by a southern US boxing announcer prior to a bout, he was then asked where he lived. Replying 'Down the river', he was announced as Joe Rivers. Johnny Kilbane took on Rivers in 1911 and outboxed him in the twenty-round bout. A rematch also went to Kilbane. Rivers was described as 'a regular bear- cat scrapper, a hit-and-miss, hammer-and-tongs battler, who took a lot of stopping'. On July 4, 1912, he fought Ad Wolgast for the lightweight title. At the beginning of the thirteenth round, he and Wolgast both landed punches that sent the other down. Wolgast fell on top of Rivers, and referee Jack Welch helped Wolgast to his feet and began the count on Rivers. Welch declared Wolgast the winner by a technical knockout, in one of the most controversial decisions in the history of boxing. His father, Andrew Ybarra, died at aged 58 years on January 23, 1913 of tuberculosis. On March 1, 1913 he married Pauline Slert of Santa Monica, California. Rivers was cited incorrectly to have died in 1918 when, after enlisting in World War I, the SS Tuscania was torpedoed. By 1955 he was living alone, in a windowless room on West Second Street in Los Angeles. His only possession of value was his father's 200-year-old violin, which he played daily. He died on June 26, 1957 in Inglewood, California. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles.

The convoy of American, British, Greek and Dutch ships was attacked on 6 November 1943 by 25 German land based aircraft. Six Allied vessels were sunk or damaged and six German aircraft were destroyed. German forces achieved a tactical victory, though the Allied warships involved received credit for defending their convoy and reacting to their losses quickly. The quick response led to the rescue of over 6,000 service men and civilians without further loss of life. Background Convoy KMF-25A consisted of 26 transports escorted by 15 warships. It sailed from Liverpool to Naples. The 26 transports carried roughly 28,000 American, British and Canadian soldiers as well as war supplies and nurses. Most, if not all of the vessels were armed with small naval and anti-aircraft guns; the American and Dutch ships had armed guards aboard who manned the weapons. The convoy was designated Task Group 60.2 and was under the command of United States Navy Captain Charles C. Hartman in his flagship . Task Group 60.2 included the British light cruiser and the destroyers USS Mervine, , , , , , and HMS Haydon with two other vessels. There were also four destroyer escorts, two Greek and two American, including and . On 27 October 1943, convoy KMF-25A left Great Britain for Egypt and ultimately to Italy. After passing Gibraltar, the ships received air support from the Royal Air Force, but these aircraft squadrons could only help so much as each was constantly being rotated out with another. The rotation left the convoy without support for several minutes at a time while the Royal Air Force sent new planes. It was during one of these periods that a force of nine Luftwaffe torpedo planes and 16 bombers intercepted the convoy. Action The convoy sailed in columns of seven to nine ships each from Mers-El-Kebir to Naples. USS Laub was alone and ahead of the fleet to provide a radar screen. USS Melvine led the warships in a circular course around the three columns. Beatty and Tillman were astern in the rear and Mervine was ahead. Just after sunset, at about 17:45 on 6 November, the convoy was sailing in overcast weather, away from Philippeville off Cape Bougaroun when USS Laub detected six enemy aircraft attacking from the north. Laubs commander radioed Captain Hartman who signalled the destroyers to make smoke and prepare for action. The thousands of soldiers and civilians were also ordered to go below deck and remain there until the threat was over. A moment later, USS Tillman picked up an enemy aircraft and opened fire at a range of , too far to be accurate but the shots served as a warning to the other nearby escorts. SS Monterey in the 1930s. German forces included Heinkel He 111s with F5B torpedoes, Dornier Do 217s with Henschel Hs 293 missiles and Junkers Ju 88s. They were separated into small groups and attacked at a low altitude, around above the surface of the sea. First, the Americans sent out friend or foe signals to the approaching enemy, but when one of the aircraft was identified as German, Hartman was informed and he ordered the escorts to open fire. As the German planes came within range, both the escorts and the transports opened fire toward the sky with a massive hail of machine gun, anti-aircraft and naval gunfire. Seconds later, the Germans began firing their missiles and launching torpedoes. The battle last under 30 minutes but in that time thousands of pounds of ordnance were expended. USS Beatty, under Commander William Outerson, first observed machine gun fire at 18:03 and picked up five incoming planes followed by a bomb explosion at 18:04. At 18:05, she opened fire on two more incoming Ju 88 torpedo planes, away, which were trying to pass themselves off as friendly. Most of the attacking aircraft seemed to be after Tillman, but she avoided being hit due to her captain who expertly steered his ship through the bombing. The first aircraft sighted by Tillman was a Dornier, which dropped a gliding bomb about off the beam while under heavy fire from the destroyer's main battery. When the projectile was from the ship, machine gun fire from Tillman struck the bomb and it fell into a steep dive, crashing off the port side. The bomber was then struck and blown up by Tillmans 5-inch (130 mm) guns while another bomb exploded off the starboard beam. Though Tillman escaped being hit, concussion damaged the destroyer's fire-control radar and aft plates. At 18:13, one of the German torpedo planes launched a torpedo from 500 yards at Beatty, 30 seconds later, the missile struck the after engine room near frame 124. The explosion blew a relatively small hole in Beatty; 11 men were killed in action, one died later of wounds and a third sailor, Radioman 3rd Class Samuel Poland was blown overboard along with a K-gun and a depth charge. The charge did not explode. One officer and six men were wounded and USS Beatty slowly began to sink. Immediately damage control parties were sent out to patch the torpedo hole and extinguish fires while others jettisoned topside weight, ammunition and even the tow cable among other things. The engine room flooded which put out all electronics aboard. One of the magazines also filled with water which left Beatty listing twelve degrees to port. The destroyer remained afloat for over four hours before her crew abandoned ship at 19:00 and she sank at position 37¬∫10'N, 06¬∫00'E. With her keel damaged, the destroyer broke in half and sank at about 23:00. The wounded were transferred to USS Parker. Ju 88s over the Mediterranean in 1943. , a War Shipping Administration (WSA) allocated Matson ocean liner operated as a troopship, was in the convoy under Captain Elis R. Johanson and armed with 20 millimeter antiaircraft guns. One torpedo bomber came in for an attack on Monterey but her gunners downed the plane before a torpedo could be dropped. The aircraft began to lose altitude and as it passed over Montery: it struck and tore off some radio equipment. Captain Johanson later received the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal. , a WSA allocated Grace Line liner converted to a troopship, under William C. Renaut, was hit twice and sank hours later at position while being towed into Philippeville harbour. Santa Elena was carrying 1,848 Canadian troops and 101 nurses. Four crewmen were killed and the American armed guard on board freed several men who were trapped below. Two armed Dutch transports were struck: , with 2,900 troops on board, was heavily damaged but suffered no deaths; Aldegonde initially survived long enough to make it to shore, where she grounded and sank within Philippeville's outer harbour as her commander was trying to beach her. Thousands of soldiers, merchant sailors, and regular navy sailors became stranded in the water. The other damaged Dutch ship was the steamer ; one man was killed but the ship made it to port. At around 18:30, a German bomber close to SS Almanzora, was hit by concentrated fire form the armed transport, the plane struck abreast of No2 hatch, port side. A portion of wing landed on the bow, the pilot's log book and other items from the cockpit were later discovered and handed to Military Intelligence at port. Both of the sunken transports were not heavily damaged but sustained enough to cause a sinking. The Germans dropped dozens of missiles and torpedoes but most of them failed to hit further targets. At least four hits were made on the Allied fleet which destroyed six aircraft in return: an estimated ten German aviators were killed. British and Greek forces sustained no damage or casualties. HMS Colombo steamed ahead of the centre column of ships and provided accurate anti-aircraft fire: she shot down at least one enemy aircraft. USS Davison destroyed one German plane as well. By 18:20, all of the torpedo planes and bombers were out of the convoy's sight and returning to base. Seventeen Americans and Dutchmen were killed and at least nine others were wounded. Captain Hartman reported that the German planes focused on the escorts so they could attack the transports unopposed but because the Allies returned fire accurately, the Germans suffered heavy losses and ultimately only six vessels of 41 were damaged. Aftermath HMS Colombo in July 1943. Operations to rescue adrift survivors began while bombs were still falling. American destroyers came alongside the damaged transports and helped evacuate the crews while British policy dictated that no survivors were to be rescued until after the fighting had ceased. This protocol proved deadly a few weeks later off Algeria when the same German squadron attacked and sank . Because the British escorts failed to rescue survivors immediately, 1,016 American soldiers drowned with 122 crewmen.Contemporary accounts by British and U.S. officers state that a substantial number of the casualties, half has been suggested, were a direct result of the bomb strike and others resulted from the unauthorised release of lifeboats by U.S. soldiers who were untrained in the launch procedure. USS Beattys crew was rescued at about 20:00 by Laub and Parker. Meanwhile, four more U.S. Navy destroyers and tugs from Philippeville and Algiers were sent to help. The minesweeper rescued men from Santa Elena and the destroyer rescued Radioman Samuel Poland the following morning. Other survivors were saved by Ruyz and Aldegonde before she grounded. While Monterey was picking up survivors, a nurse fell from the netting she was climbing on and a Chinese cook jumped overboard and saved her. In all, 6,228 people were rescued without further loss of life. During the battle off Cape Bougaroun, one unknown sailor aboard Beatty dropped over the side a message in a bottle. The message read \\"Our ship is sinking. SOS didn't do any good. Think it's the end. Maybe this message will get to the U.S. some day.\\" In 1944 the bottle was found on the beaches of Maine, meaning it had floated hundreds of miles across both the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic before reaching the U.S. See also *Action off Bougainville *Mediterranean naval engagements during World War I Notes References *Lubeski, Ray, \\"Linebackers of the Sea\\", Author House Publishing Bloomingfield, Indiana (2010), pp. 83‚Äì85 *Olver F., Edward, \\"Cruise Travel Magazine: History of the Great Liners\\" (1983) pp. 49‚Äì50  *Morison Eliot, Samuel, \\"History of United States Naval operations in World War II: The Atlantic Battle Won\\", Little, Brown and Company Inc.

Early life and education Fallon was born in September, 1964 to Barbara and Jim Fallon in an Army hospital in Fort Huachuca, Arizona. He has two brothers, T.J. and Sean, and one sister, Beth. He moved 15 times as a child because his father was in the military.* Fallon attended University of Texas at Austin, which he chose because tuition was affordable. He earned an undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering, a major he chose because UT Austin did not offer premed. He then studied emergency medicine at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth). Fallon interned at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona and did his residency at Denver General, now known as Denver Health. Medical career After completing his residency, Fallon spent six years practicing emergency medicine, first in the Atlanta, Georgia area, and then back in Denver at Exempla Lutheran emergency group. While at Exempla Lutheran, Fallon realized that \\"there were more affordable and effective ways to care for patients who visited the ER,\\" so he started the first of three urgent care clinics in the Denver metropolitan area, where he served as \\"physician, business manager, janitor and snow remover.\\" In 2008, Fallon sold his urgent care clinics and returned to work as an ER Physician. He currently works in several emergency rooms throughout the region. 2010 U.S. Congressional campaign Fallon's opponents in the general election were Democratic incumbent Diana DeGette, Libertarian nominee Clint Jones, Green nominee Gary Swing, and American Constitutional Party nominee Chris Styskal. Fallon had never run for office before. He decided to run for office while listening to Dave Logan interview DeGette on NewsRadio 850 KOA regarding her support of the Affordable Health Care for America Act. Fallon's campaign in the Democrat heavy district was characterized by informal \\"town hall meetings,\\" often held at local pubs, and by \\"door-to-door\\" interaction with voters. Fallon has received support from many diverse groups, including Democrats in Denver's Park Hill neighborhood and local gay activists. On September 20, 2010, Fallon made national news when the NRCC upgraded him to \\"On the Radar\\" status - the first of three levels in their Young Guns Program The day after Fallon was granted \\"On the Radar\\" status, he was interviewed by Mike Rosen. The Mike Rosen show had previously denied a request from Fallon's campaign for an interview because they did not think he was a serious candidate At the beginning of the interview, Rosen told listeners that they \\"ought to know more about Mike Fallon ... because his is a name that I think you'll be hearing in the future.\\" On September 22, 2010, DeGette sent an email to supporters, informing them of Fallon's \\"On the Radar\\" status, and requesting donations, stating that, \\"We can't take anything for granted this year.\\" The fundraising request received significant local media attention. A poll conducted by ccAdvertising on October 17‚Äì19, 2010, found Fallon to be trailing DeGette by 7.5 percent, 43.8 percent to 36.4 percent. Dr. Fallon lost the November 2, 2010 election to Representative DeGette. The results, with 98 percent of precincts reporting, were Diana Degette 67.4 percent, Mike Fallon 28.8 percent, Gary Swing 1.3 percent, Clint Jones 1.3 percent, Chris Styskal 0.9 percent Political positions =Health Care= Fallon believes that, while the healthcare reform measures \\"set out to do some good things,\\" such as creating high risk pools, increased access, and increased portability, the problem with the legislation is that it has not been paid for. Fallon says the legislation will cost 3, 4, or 5 times more than originally reported. He has said he believes that ultimately the health care legislation will slowly push private entities out of the market - and push the American people toward single payer health care. Fallon would like to remove the anti-trust exemption that health insurance companies currently enjoy, so that true free-market principles can bring down the cost of care. He also believes that entrepreneurial consumer-based medicine (in which he has experience from his background starting urgent care clinics) is part of the answer to our future in health care. In response to his opponent's praise of the health care bill, Fallon was quoted as saying, \\"This new health reform bill helps quasi- government based hospitals, emergency rooms and community health centers ‚Äî these benefits are the positive outcomes of this legislation, but, these centers of care are just a fraction of our entire health system. The news that two clinics at the University of Colorado Hospital will no longer take government insurance plans highlights a larger problem with this legislation. More and more private medical providers will no longer take government insurance plans, thus, reducing the access this bill portends to provide.\\" Personal life Fallon and his wife, Sandy, have two small children.

It was written by Ian Brennan, directed by Ryan Murphy, and premiered on Fox on November 16, 2010. The episode guest stars Gwyneth Paltrow as Holly Holliday, a substitute teacher who takes the place of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) while he is ill. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) causes problems as the fill-in substitute principal of William McKinley High School, and glee club members Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) experience tension in their friendship. The episode features cover versions of six songs, which received mixed reviews from critics. While the Glee cover of Cee Lo Green's \\"Forget You\\" and mash-up of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" with Rihanna's \\"Umbrella\\" attracted critical praise and charted both on the Billboard Hot 100 and internationally, the episode's dance-based performances were criticized for their choreography and strict adherence to the original versions. The episode was watched by 11.70 million US viewers, and was the top scripted show among adults aged 18‚Äì49 for the week of broadcast. Paltrow's guest appearance attracted positive commentary, but the episode's sub-plots were less well received. Aly Semigran of MTV, Robert Canning of IGN and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack all deemed the episode one of the best of the season. Time James Poniewozik felt that it was a relatively subdued, mediocre episode, and Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found it to be an improvement on the previous two episodes, if not genuinely good. The National Alliance on Mental Illness criticized the episode for its depiction of bipolar disorder. Paltrow won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance. Plot Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is appointed acting principal of William McKinley High School after having Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) infected with the flu. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) is also infected, and takes time off work to recover. He is cared for by his ex-wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), which leads to them sleeping together. Glee club co- captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) attempts to take over for Will, but this results in chaos. At the request of Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), club lessons are instead covered by substitute teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), whose unconventional methods include discussing Lindsay Lohan's rehabilitation in Spanish, singing \\"Conjunction Junction\\" to her English class, and roleplaying as a bipolar Mary Todd Lincoln for the History class. When Holly first arrives at glee club rehearsal, she impresses the club with her rendition of Cee Lo Green's \\"Forget You\\". Rachel is annoyed and worries that Holly may be unable to sufficiently prepare them for the upcoming Sectionals competition. Holly later wins over Rachel by duetting with her on \\"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\\" from Chicago. Kurt neglects his best friend Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) in favor of his new friend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss). Mercedes is offended when Kurt tries to set her up on a date with a football player on the basis that they are both black, and feels left out when she accompanies Kurt and Blaine to dinner, where conversation is dominated by gay issues and icons. When Sue begins a healthy eating initiative and declares a ban on \\"Potater Tots\\", Mercedes organizes a student protest and fills the tailpipe of Sue's car with Tots, causing $17,000 worth of damage. Sue's initiative proves popular with the students' parents, and her appointment as principal is made permanent. She fires Will, who is later visited by Holly seeking advice. Holly feels out of her depth as a teacher, having enabled Mercedes' behavior. She confesses that she originally took her work seriously, until a student (Lindsay Sims-Lewis) punched her in the face, prompting her more laid-back approach. Terri arrives while they are talking and is angered by Holly's presence. Will asks her to leave, telling her that their reunion was a mistake and concluding their relationship for good. Kurt confronts Mercedes, suggesting that she is substituting food for love and their friendship for a romantic relationship. Mercedes decides to talk to the student Kurt attempted to set her up with. As she departs, Kurt is approached by school bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler), who threatens to kill him if Kurt reveals his closeted homosexuality. At the urging of the glee club members, Sue reinstates Will. He suggests a group performance of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\", but asks for Holly's help to modernize it, resulting in a mash-up with Rihanna's \\"Umbrella\\". Production The role of Holly Holliday was created specifically for Paltrow (pictured). Paltrow's Glee appearance marked her first ever scripted-series guest performance. The role of Holly was created for her by series creator Ryan Murphy, a personal friend who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of the December 2010 release of the film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Upon announcing her casting in September 2010, BBC News reported that she would appear in two episodes of the series. E! Online's Kristin dos Santos stated that Holly would serve as a love interest for Will, with Murphy later confirming that Holly's appearance would create a love quadrangle between herself, Will, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and her boyfriend Carl Howell (John Stamos). However, Fancast later reported that Paltrow's guest-arc had been reduced to a single episode, and neither Mays nor Stamos appear in \\"The Substitute\\". Post-broadcast, Murphy stated that both he and Paltrow hoped that she would appear on Glee again in the future, depending on the right storyline. In December 2010, Paltrow confirmed that she would return to the series for another episode at a later date, and in January 2011, Murphy confirmed her reappearance, this time as a sex education teacher planned for episodes 15 and 16. Paltrow won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her appearance in \\"The Substitute\\". \\"The Substitute\\" includes a fantasy sequence in which Will hallucinates the club members as kindergarten-aged children. Child actors were hired to portray the characters' younger selves, including Jake Vaughn and Lauren Boles as a young Finn and Rachel. The episode also features the return of Gilsig, following an absence spanning several episodes. The actress felt that Will's illness allowed viewers to see the couple with their defences down for the first time, and that the addition of Holly highlighted a double standard in their relationship. She explained that while Terri is not \\"the most palatable person\\", she is at least faithful to Will, while he has \\"a wandering eye\\" and treats Terri badly in \\"The Substitute\\".* Recurring characters in this episode include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), Principal Figgins, school bully Dave Karofsky, cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), wrestler Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) and Kurt's friend Blaine Anderson. The episode features cover versions of six songs. Paltrow performs on four, which she recorded in a single afternoon. Her numbers include \\"Conjunction Junction\\" from Schoolhouse Rock!, and a clean version of Cee Lo Green's \\"Fuck You!\\" entitled \\"Forget You\\". The producers considered having Paltrow sing a Coldplay song, but decided to save the band's work for a competition episode. Morrison and Shum, Jr. enact a frame-by-frame recreation of \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" from the musical film Singin' in the Rain. Paltrow and Michele duet on \\"Nowadays / Hot Honey Rag\\" from the musical Chicago, and the glee club with Morrison and Paltrow perform a mash-up of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" with \\"Umbrella\\" by Rihanna featuring Jay-Z. The staging of \\"Singin' in the Rain / Umbrella\\" required the cast to spend twelve hours filming in a tank of water. All of the songs performed, with the exception of \\"Conjunction Junction\\", were released as singles, available for download, and \\"Forget You\\" is featured on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 4. \\"Forget You\\" and \\"Singing in the Rain / Umbrella\\" charted both on the Billboard Hot 100 and internationally. The former reached number 11 in the US and 12 in Canada, while the latter peaked at number 10 in Ireland. Green's \\"Fuck You!\\" entered the top ten of the Hot 100 for the first time following the Glee cover, with sales rising 94% in a week. Reception =Ratings= During its original broadcast, \\"The Substitute\\" was watched by 11.70 million US viewers. It attained a 5.0/14 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, making it the top-rated show of the night amongst adults aged 18‚Äì49. In the weekly program rankings, Glee was the top scripted show among adults 18‚Äì49, and placed twentieth in overall viewers. Viewership and ratings both increased from the previous episode, \\"Never Been Kissed\\", which was watched by 10.99 million viewers and attained a 4.6/13 rating/share. In Canada, viewership also improved on \\"Never Been Kissed\\", with \\"The Substitute\\" drawing 2.29 million viewers and ranking ninth for the week, up from 1.97 million and twelfth for the previous episode. In Australia, the episode drew 1.06 million viewers, making Glee the seventh most-watched show of the night, and nineteenth of the week. Viewership declined from \\"Never Been Kissed\\", which was watched by 1.08 million viewers; despite this, the series registered a rise from eighth and twenty-seventh in the daily and weekly program rankings respectively. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.55 million viewers‚Äî2.11 million on E4, and 439,000 on E4+1‚Äîbecoming the most-watched show on cable for the week. =Critical response = The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Aly Semigran of MTV, Robert Canning of IGN and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack all deemed it one of the best of the season, with Canning rating it an \\"incredible\\" 9.5/10, and Semigran stating that it contained all of the series' best elements: \\"surprising musical numbers, with the right balance of humor and life lessons.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found it to be an improvement on the previous two episodes, writing that if not genuinely good, \\"The Substitute\\" at least proved that Glee has not been entirely subsumed by its own hype. Time James Poniewozik felt that it was a relatively subdued, mediocre episode, which contained \\"a collection of good small moments\\". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair criticized the focus it placed on the adult characters at the expense of the teenagers and the disregard for continuing plot strands in favor of a celebrity cameo, but concluded that \\"despite all that, some of it kind of worked.\\" The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) took exception to this episode, which, it stated, \\"mocked and trivialized bipolar disorder\\" during Paltrow's history classroom scene, in which she role-plays as Mary Todd Lincoln. NAMI encouraged people to contact Murphy and Fox TV to convey their disappointment with the scene. Paltrow's guest appearance attracted critical praise. Both Stack and E! Online Kristin dos Santos called it Emmy-worthy, with the former rating it amongst her best ever performances, and the latter stating that Holly received \\"some of Glee best-ever one-liners. VanDerWerff enjoyed her role, and wrote that Holly injected an effortless sense of fun, despite much of her plot being nonsensical. Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker praised Paltrow for being one of the first guest stars to perform well alongside Sue, and wrote that her classroom scenes made the episode \\"one in which the guest star both stood out and meshed with the cast\\". The Atlantic Meghan Brown commented that Paltrow \\"brought a massive spark to what could have been a one-note role\\", and her Atlantic co-author Kevin Fallon wrote that her energetic performance saved an episode that might have been \\"in shambles without her presence\\". Canning stated that Paltrow's casting could have been distracting, but instead she fit the role \\"seamlessly\\", and CNN's Lisa Respers France compared her performance favorably to Britney Spears cameo in the episode \\"Britney/Brittany\\". Several critics stated that they enjoyed Paltrow's appearance despite experiencing trepidation about it prior to broadcast. Berk found her \\"surprisingly great\\", and Poniewozik said that while her casting was somewhat distracting, she was able to make Holly a sympathetic character without overdoing her neediness and commitment-phobia. Jen Chaney of The Washington Post recommended a \\"lengthy moratorium\\" on internet criticism of Paltrow, suggesting that with her Glee appearance, her \\"mission to charm the American public may be complete\\". Critics were divided over the Schuester sub- plot. Both Semigran and Poniewozik enjoyed Will's characterization, with Poniewozik commenting that he became an \\"identifiable human\\" again, following a season throughout which his behavior has been erratic and unreliable. In contrast, VanDerWerff criticized the sub-plot for ignoring Will's culpability in the breakdown of his marriage, and expressed displeasure at his inconsistent characterization, deeming it one of the season's biggest problems. Stack commented negatively on the return of Terri, finding her dislikeable and unnecessary, as Glee already has a villain in Sue. The Mercedes storyline attracted criticism. Fallon took offence at Glee sole overweight black character turning into a \\"fried potato-addicted junkie\\", and both Berk and Stack commented that while they had hoped for Mercedes to receive a major storyline, they did not want it to be centered on her weight issues. Semigran called it \\"rather disposable\\" but appreciated the \\"silliness and levity\\" it introduced, and Respers France noted that she did not mind the storyline itself, but disliked Kurt lecturing his supposed best friend. VanDerWerff felt that the Tots plot was \\"one element too many\\" in what could have been a \\"pretty potent emotional storyline\\", but praised the performances by Colfer and Riley. Stack appreciated their dinner with Blaine, finding it representative of what he enjoys about the show, commenting: \\"Last week, Kurt's sexuality was the central emotional storyline of the episode, and this week it was played for laughs. Kurt's character has to walk that fine line between being a role model and becoming too saintly. I think the writers are navigating that tightrope quite, quite well.\\" Music Cee Lo Green (pictured) expressed approval of Paltrow's cover of his song \\"Forget You\\". Musical performances also received mixed reviews. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News gave \\"Conjunction Junction\\" a grade of \\"A\\"; he noted that ordinarily he would have declined to review it due to its short length, but said \\"what a glorious ten seconds it is\\". Benigno and Poniewozik criticized the sanitization of \\"Forget You\\", but while the latter found it inferior to the original version, the former preferred Paltrow's deeper voice and graded the song \\"A\\". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman felt the censorship of the song did not adversely affect its success, and deemed Paltrow's rendition \\"charming and sassy\\". Megan Vick of Billboard called it \\"the most exciting number\\" of the episode, and Stack went further in his praise: he bestowed a grade of \\"A+\\" and lauded it as \\"one of the most memorable and energetic Glee performances ever, thanks in no small part to Paltrow\\". Green told MTV that he was flattered by the cover, particularly as he was not aware Paltrow would perform it when granting Glee clearance. He called her performance \\"great\\", and commented that he had not been aware she was such an accomplished vocalist. Benigno and Stack praised the choreography of \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\", but both graded it lower than \\"Forget You\\", at a \\"B\\" and \\"B+\\" respectively. Futterman called the recreation an \\"impressive feat\\", but likened it to hallucinatory Britney Spears covers in the episode \\"Britney/Brittany\\" in that it \\"stands alone better than it fits into the plot.\\" Vick was critical of the performance, observing that Glee covers from musicals often introduce classic songs to viewers with a modern twist, an element which was absent in \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\". The Chicago cover also left some critics wanting, and Futterman, The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez and The Atlantic Patrick Burns all found its choreography lacking. Fallon suggested that Glee should be wary of overusing recreations, having already done so in \\"The Power of Madonna\\", \\"Britney/Brittany\\" and \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\", and VanDerWerff criticized the performances as \\"outright plagiarism, not homage\\". Benigno and Futterman compared \\"Singin' in the Rain / Umbrella\\" favorably to mash-ups performed in the preceding episode. Benigno graded it \\"B\\", though he said that by using \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" as the chorus, the song lacked catharsis, a sentiment echoed by Flandez, who praised the costumes, props and staging, but wished the rendition had had more \\"bite\\" and \\"attitude\\". Futterman described it as a \\"buoyant and catchy homage to the old and the new [that] perfectly captures Glee musical spirit\\". In contrast, Vick felt the song could not compare to the previous episode's mash-ups. She deemed the staging implausible, questioning how a glee club in financial difficulty could afford elaborate water features for a rehearsal number. Stack was willing to overlook such improbability; he wrote that he loved the mash-up and graded it an \\"A‚àí\\". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times appreciated the choreography and the manner in which \\"Paltrow's sassiness undercuts [Morrison's] overripe sweetness\\", and named it potentially her favorite group number of the season.

Geographically located in Southern Hertfordshire, the complex is specifically located on Eldon Avenue in Borehamwood, in the WD postcode area of England. This site was the first of several such complexes colloquially referred to as 'Elstree Studios' located in the area. Originally created as a film studio complex, in the late 1950s the site was converted for use as a television studio, becoming the main television production site for Lew Grade's Associated Television (ATV) franchise for the ITV network. After ATV became Central Television in the early 1980s and moved to a new Midlands- based complex, this site was sold to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 1984. It is currently a main production base for BBC Television, with the television studios being run by the BBC's commercial subsidiary BBC Studioworks, previously known as BBC Studios and Post Production. The BBC Elstree Centre site includes the external set for the long-running soap opera EastEnders and medical drama Holby City. With the sale and partial demolition of BBC Television Centre in west London, BBC Television's original head office and primary TV production site, Studio D at Elstree has since been utilised for many of the BBC's large studio productions; such as Children in Need, and the BBC's 2015 General Election coverage. During the 2010s, BBC Studioworks began operating three additional sound stages, newly equipped for television, at the nearby Elstree Studios on Shenley Road. History =Film studio= The Neptune Film Company opened the first studios in Borehamwood in 1914. It contained just a single window-less stage (the first 'dark stage' in England), relying on electricity from a gas-powered generator for lighting. At the time, this was an innovation, as the majority of early films were shot in large glass-roof studios which relied on natural light.BBC Elstree at TV Studio History, URL accessed 6 November 2015 It was said that Borehamwood was chosen as it had a good London train service, but was far enough away to avoid the then-regular London pea soup fogs. Production ceased during 1917, and the studio was sold to the Ideal Film Company, who used the site up until 1924. During 1928, the studio was sold to Ludwig Blattner, who connected it to the electricity mains and introduced a German system of sound recording. The Blattner Studio was leased to Joe Rock Productions during 1934, and two years later it purchased the site. Rock Productions built four new large stages, and began making films, including the drama film The Edge of the World (1937), directed by Michael Powell. The studios were owned by British National Films Company between 1939 and 1948, although during this period a large portion of the studio was taken over by the British government for war work. During 1953, the studios were bought by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., mainly for television production. Early productions included the Douglas Fairbanks Presents series (1953‚Äì1957), and a few episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. =ATV= The studios were sold to Lew Grade's Associated Television (ATV) in 1958. The original intention of the new owners was to use the facility for production of the affiliated ITC filmed series. The Adventures of William Tell (1958‚Äì59) was produced here, but ATV's existing television studios were insufficient for its requirements. A site on London's South Bank had been purchased, but completion of a wholly new complex would be some years in the future, while the need for more studio space was urgent. As a result, the Eldon Avenue centre was re- equipped as an electronic television complex, and most of ATV's live and recorded shows were made there. The series made by the affiliated ITC, such as The Saint, Gideon's Way, and The Prisoner, were shot on 35mm film at other companies' neighbouring Elstree facilities or elsewhere,Louis Barfe, Turned Out Nice Again: The Story of British Light Entertainment, London: Atlantic Books, 2008, pp.122-23 mostly at the (Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) Elstree (Film) Studios, and MGM-British Studios. Originally, some ATV programmes were made at the Alpha studios in Aston, Birmingham, as ATV had the weekday ITV Midland franchise as well as the weekend London franchise until network changes in 1968. After 1970, programmes such as Crossroads were made at the new Birmingham studios at the ATV Centre. Larger-scale productions, including many drama programmes, continued to be recorded at the Elstree facility for the rest of ATV's existence. In the period of its occupation of the Elstree complex, the smaller Studios A and B were used for schools TV and sitcoms, while Studio C was a drama studio. Studio D, with permanent audience seating, was used for light entertainment programmesBarfe Turned Out Nice Again], p.108 such as the ATV Morecambe and Wise series (Two of a Kind, 1961‚Äì68) and The Muppet Show (1976‚Äì81).Brian Jay Jones, Jim Henson: The Biography, London: Random House, 2013, p.126 ATV was restructured as Central Independent Television for the new contractual period beginning in January 1982. One of the conditions of its licence renewal by the governing body of the ITV network, then the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), was that ATV should vacate any London-based facilities and become entirely focused on the English Midlands, the region of the United Kingdom for which it had held the ITV franchise since 1968. For the last 18 months of its use as an ITV production studio, the complex was under the ownership of Central Independent Television; as ATV ceased to exist as a company at the end of 31 December 1981. The studios remained in operation by Central TV up until July 1983 (the final production under Central ownership being a Max Bygraves-era episode of Family Fortunes), when its new main production centre in Nottingham was completed. =BBC Elstree Centre= Back of Albert Square, external part of the set of EastEnders. EMI 2001s on their last day in British National Studios at BBC Elstree Studio C in July 1991. The last programme in the world to use EMI 2001s to record images was EastEnders. When the BBC bought the Elstree site in 1984 to produce its new soap opera EastEnders (first aired on 19 February 1985), it did not purchase the equipment within the building.\\"Chronomedia: 1984\\", TerraMedia.co.uk Some sources state that as a consequence, Central TV's studio technicians were instructed to make the equipment left behind inoperable (there are particular claims about the camera prisms being smashed). Other sources dispute this, claiming the equipment was already so old and worthless there would have been no gain in intentionally disabling it. When the BBC moved in, it repaired equipment that was not beyond repair, sometimes using spare parts from identical pieces of equipment already in BBC use. The EMI 2001 television cameras used in Studio 3 at BBC Television Centre, Shepherd's Bush, were moved into the newly renamed 'BBC Elstree Centre' as part of that studio's refurbishment, instead of being stripped down for spare parts. Central TV's own EMI 2001s were considered to be beyond economic repair by BBC staff sent to examine the site, regardless of whether they had been intentionally disabled or not by Central TV employees. Elstree kept the EMI 2001s until 1991. Elstree's first new cameras were to be Thomson TTV-1531s, one of the last plumbicon-tubed cameras to be made. These camera were again replaced in the mid-1990s with Thomson TTV-1542 and TTV-1647 lightweight cameras using the then-new camera technology of a charge-coupled device (CCD). Widescreen was introduced in 1999, using Philips/Thomson LDK 100s. In 2010, the cameras across the site were again upgraded, this time to Sony HSC-300s. Buildings 'Fairbanks', with its distinctive green-tiled roof, is the oldest surviving building on the site, part of the studios constructed during the 1930s. It sits adjacent to the largest studios, Studio C and D. Holby City Hospital reception entrance, as used on the fictional medical drama Holby City, filmed at Elstree. 'Neptune House' was built during the 1960s, and has a glass-fronted entrance. It has featured in several popular television series, including as the school in Grange Hill, and since 1999, as the hospital reception for Holby City. A purpose-built set was constructed for Grange Hill at the back of the building in 1989, but was dismantled when the series left Elstree in 2002. Neptune House can be seen in the opening titles of Gerry Anderson's science-fiction series UFO (1970) as Harlington-Straker Film Studios, the (literal) cover for the secret and below- ground headquarters of SHADO. The hospital 'wards' in Holby City are actually the top floor of Neptune House, fully kitted out, allowing genuine outside views from the windows. The building's staircases are seen almost constantly in the series. =Backlot= Exteriors and interiors of the Queen Vic are filmed on site The exterior set for the fictional East London setting Albert Square in EastEnders is located in the permanent backlot at . Originally constructed in 1984, the set is outdoors and open to the elements; by 2010, it was looking increasingly shabby. It was rebuilt for compliance with the requirements of high-definition television (HD TV) on the same site in 2013‚Äì2014, using mostly real brick, with some areas using a new improved plastic brick. Throughout rebuilding filming would still take place, and so scaffolding was often seen on screen during the process, with some story lines written to accommodate the rebuilding, such as the Queen Vic fire. In January 2014, the BBC announced on the EastEnders website that the set has been approved to be expanded by twenty percent; creating a new permanent front lot, located on the site of the former staff car park. This expansion project is the 'E20' project, which by 2018 had already gone over-budget. =Studios= The Big Fat Quiz of the Year set in Studio D Through the Keyhole set in Studio D Of the seven large studios on site, all are operated by BBC Studioworks. However, only one (Studio D) is available for hire, the other six being permanently dedicated to EastEnders. There are also a number of smaller studios used for the filming of Holby City. The current configuration is as follows: Studio A 66 √ó 62 metric feet within fire lanes. Part of the EastEnders studio facilities. It has an overhang in one corner with production galleries above, but these areas are no longer used. Studio B 70 √ó 62 metric feet within fire lanes. Part of the EastEnders studio facilities. Like A, C and D, it has an overhang in one corner with production galleries above. The original gallery facilities have been modified into two separate production galleries for use on EastEnders, and both can control any of the studios on site (other than Studio D) plus the backlot. Studio C 102 √ó 68 metric ft within fire lanes. Part of the EastEnders studio facilities. Like A, B and D, it has an overhang in one corner with production galleries above. The original gallery facilities have been converted into a switching and engineering area for BBC News' election broadcasts. Studio D 114 √ó 78 metric feet, excluding audience seating The only studio on site available for hire via BBC Studioworks, this is a light-entertainment studio with permanent audience seating in a recessed area of one wall.

He had previously served as the final Governor of the Republic of Maryland from 1855 until its annexation by Liberia on 18 March 1857. Born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1821, Drayton served as the black minister at St. John's Lutheran Church in Charleston under Minister John Bachman. In 1845, Drayton was sent by Bachman to serve as a missionary in Cape Palmas in the newly formed Republic of Maryland. He later pursued a career in politics, becoming the Lieutenant Governor of Maryland under Governor William A. Prout. In December 1855, Drayton ousted Prout, who had become increasingly unpopular, and assumed the governorship, later being unanimously elected in April 1856 as the Governor of Maryland. By December of that year, relations between the American settlers and the native Grebo population had deteriorated to the point of open warfare. As Maryland had less than 1,000 settlers and had poor financing, Drayton appealed to Liberia for assistance. In response, Liberian President J. J. Roberts dispatched a force of Liberian settlers to put down the Grebo rebellion. Drayton soon negotiated the annexation of Maryland by Liberia and stepped down as governor on 18 March 1857. Drayton was later appointed Chief Justice of Liberia by President Stephen Allen Benson in 1861, which he served as until stepping down in 1864.

Its main characteristic is the thick yellow sauce made from rice flour mixed with beef and offal broth, turmeric, ginger, garlic, coriander, galangal root, cumin, curry powder and salt. In Medan, many Sate Padang use not only beef but also chicken and lamb. There are three types of sate padang, which are sate padang, sate padang panjang and sate pariaman. The three types are differentiated by the colour of their sauce. Sate Padang Panjang usually has yellow-coloured sauce while Sate Pariaman has red-coloured sauce. Since the sauces are made differently, the taste of both sate differ. Sate Padang has a flavor blended from the other two. Fresh beef is boiled twice in a large drum filled with water to make the meat soft and juicy. Then the meat is sliced into parts and spices are sprinkled on the meat. The broth is then used to make the sauce, mixed with 19 kinds of spices which have been smoothed and stirred with various kinds of chili. All seasonings are then put together and cooked for 15 minutes. The sate will be grilled just before serving, using coconut shell charcoal.

Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad. After serving initially as the Chief Martial Law Administrator, Ershad assumed the post of president in 1983 and ruled until 1990. Background Ershad pictured in 1986. After its independence in 1971, Bangladesh saw a series of military coups, beginning with the assassination of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975, by a group of army officers, who installed Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed as president. The Khondaker Mostaq regime was overthrown on November 3 of the same year by pro-Mujib officers led by Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf and Colonel Shafat Jamil. A counter-coup on November 7 brought army chief Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman to power. In 1977, Ziaur Rahman assumed the post of president and handed over the post of army chief to Lt. Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Zia formed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and sought to reintroduce democracy in Bangladesh, but in 1981 he was assassinated by a group of army officers under Maj. Gen. Abul Manzoor. Although it was feared that the army would seize power again, army chief Ershad remained loyal to Ziaur Rahman's civilian successor, the vice-president Justice Abdus Sattar and crushed the Manzoor-led coup attempt. Sattar became the presidential candidate of the BNP in the 1982 election, which he won. Causes With the death of Ziaur Rahman, who had been an army general himself, the Bangladeshi military lost a patron and the close contact and political influence it had enjoyed with the president. Upon taking power, Sattar, a former judge without a military background, announced that the role of the military was strictly to protect the territory and borders of the country. Army chief of staff Ershad pressured the Sattar government to concede a greater role for the military in the government, threatening to seize power if its demands were not met. Sattar's position was also threatened by challenges to his leadership from various factions within the BNP and from opposition political parties such as the Awami League. In face of growing pressure, Sattar conceded the military's demand of creating a national security council with the military chiefs with the authority of overseeing the national defence and security policies. He also sacked the vice-president Mirza Nurul Hada due to pressure from Ershad. However, he tried to reaffirm his position by a relieving number of military officers of their government posts and returning them to their units. This proved to be a provocation to Ershad and the other chiefs. Coup On March 24, 1982, troops loyal to Lt. Gen. Ershad forced the president Abdus Sattar and the vice-president to resign. Ershad imposed martial law and declared himself the chief martial law administrator. He appointed the chiefs of the navy and the air force as deputy chief martial law administrators. He also suspended fundamental civil rights and the Constitution of Bangladesh, but did not abrogate it. Three days after the coup, a Supreme Court of Bangladesh justice Abul Fazal Muhammad Ahsanuddin Chowdhury was appointed president by Ershad, who also took the title of president of the council of ministers. Ershad declared that he had undertaken the coup to save the country from the corruption and inefficiency of the BNP- led government. The Parliament of Bangladesh was dissolved and all political parties banned. Several hundred politicians were arrested on charges of corruption. In 1983, Ershad took over as president of Bangladesh. Seventh amendment In parliamentary elections held in 1986 , the Jatiyo Party, founded by Ershad earlier that year, won an absolute majority even as opposition political parties boycotted the election. Ershad used his party's majority to pass the seventh amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh, which legitimised the 1982 coup, his ascension to power and his martial law rule. The amendment also ratified the martial law decrees and actions of the government. In 2010, the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh officially struck down the seventh amendment and declared Ershad's coup and martial law rule as illegal. The verdict declared that the constitution of Bangladesh could not be subordinate to martial law, nor did it allow any temporary suspension of the constitution itself. The Supreme Court named Ershad along with Ziaur Rahman and Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad as \\"usurpers\\" of power from legitimate governments. The Supreme Court also stated that the government and parliament could decide whether or not to take action against Ershad for the illegal usurpation and pass a law to enable a trial and prevent any future usurpations.

The Corrick Family was a troupe of musicians and entertainers from Christchurch, New Zealand. They toured widely throughout New Zealand, Australia, India, Southeast Asia and England during the period 1898 to 1915. They advertised themselves variously as The Corricks, The Corrick Family, The Corrick Family Entertainers, and The Marvellous Corricks. Their performances included singing, dancing, handbell ringing, comic sketches and film presentations, as well as the playing of various musical instruments. Consisting of two parents and their eight children, the Corricks regularly received enthusiastic reviews from the Press, however young singer Elsie was often regarded as their outstanding performer. The Family Albert Corrick was born in Somerset, England. In 1862, at the age of 14, he immigrated to New Zealand with his family on the 'Mermaid',Account of the Ship Mermaid arriving in Lyttelton on 26 December. The family settled in Christchurch, where they became active in the city's musical life. Albert went on to pursue a career as a music teacher, church organist and composer. In February 1877, acting as the conductor of a local church choir, he married Sarah Alice Calvert, a 23-year-old singer in the choir. Sarah, like Albert, had emigrated with her family from her native Durham in England, arriving in Lyttelton on the Zealandia in November 1859.Passenger list of the Zealandia Albert and Sarah opened an academy of music in Colombo Street, Christchurch, importing sheet music and teaching musical instruments. By 1879, they were immersed in the local church and musical scene, and started to conduct sacred concerts.NZ Star, 10 October 1879 Albert and Sarah raised a family of seven daughters and one son:Their first child, in 1877, was stillborn, and another, Albert Sydney Austin, born 24 June 1881, survived less than seven months. * Emily Eleanor Gertrude ('Gertie'), born 5 December 1878 * Alice May, born 4 March 1880 * Amy Beatrice, born 11 November 1882 * Ethel Mildred, born 20 September 1884 * Henry John Leonard ('Leonard', 'Sonny'), born 26 October 1886 * Ruby Florence Elizabeth, born 1 May 1888 * Jessie Winifred, born 27 October 1892, and * Elsie Collingwood, born 31 August 1894 Early Concerts Albert and Sarah raised their children to have a keen appreciation of music, and all the children were encouraged to play various instruments, and to sing and dance.Ruby developed breathing problems as a child, so Albert decided to teach her the French horn and the cornet as a treatment. This proved successful. Soon realizing that his children had considerable talent, Albert organized local church and charity concerts featuring the family, which met with warm approval from the local public and press.NZ Star, 6 November 1897 In particular, young Alice was attracting praise for her beautiful voice, as noted in 1897 in the Ellesmere Guardian.NZ Ellesmere Guardian, 23 October 1897 In April 1898, at the suggestion of a Corrick relation,Searell married Sarah‚Äôs niece, Emily Jane Wood architect Thomas Searell, Alice visited Hobart, Tasmania, and sang at the Town Hall under Vice-Regal patronage.Hobart Mercury, 21 April 1898Hobart Mercury, 22 April 1898 By public demand, Alice's stay in Tasmania stretched out to several months, and she gave numerous concerts around the state. At her farewell concert in Hobart in November 1898Hobart Mercury, 22 November 1898 she was directly compared to renowned Tasmania singer Madame Amy Sherwin. Tours =New Zealand= In 1899, the family started a series of performing tours of New Zealand, visiting cities and towns throughout the country. These tours lasted over three years, and set a punishing pace that would be maintained over the years to come. Even the youngest daughter, Elsie, drew attention, singing solo on stage aged just four years.NZ Evening Post, 22 September 1899 =Australia= In April 1902, again at the suggestion of Thomas Searell, the Corricks left New Zealand to commence a tour of Australia. (The youngest daughters, Jessie and Elsie, were left in the care of an aunt.) Travelling on the Mokoia to Hobart, they gave their first performance as a family on 21 April at the Mechanics' Institute.Hobart Mercury, 23 April 1902 It was during their initial five-day Hobart season that the description \\"The Marvellous Corricks\\" first appeared; this name was to become a standard moniker for the family during its later tours. In early May 1902, the Corricks set out on a short tour of Tasmania, and gave their first performance in Launceston ‚Äì the city which was later to become their home ‚Äì on 26 May. In November that year they set out on their first 'grand tour' of Australia, taking in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland between 1902 and 1905. Travelling initially by bus and train, the family later invested in several Model T Fords to carry themselves and their ever-growing array of dresses, instruments and equipment, thus becoming the first motorized troupe in Australia. As their popularity grew, Albert started to employ the services of an advance agent, who would travel ahead of the family to arrange bookings for venues, accommodation, and advance advertising. In May 1905 the family returned to Tasmania to take a five-month break from performing, their first significant holiday in over four years of regular touring. October 1905 saw the Corricks departed on their second major tour of Australia, heading initially to Victoria, then on to South Australia throughout 1906, and Western Australia during 1907; that same year included an extended tour of the outback goldfields of that state. In September 1907, the second-youngest daughter, Jessie, joined the family on tour. The same month, the family decided to travel overseas, and embarked on a short tour of India and the Far East. For the next few months they performed in India, Ceylon, Balochistan (part of modern Pakistan), Malaysia, and Singapore.The West Australian, 14 March 1908Singapore Straits Times, 11 May 1908 In December 1908, the family was holidaying in England with family, and \\"furthering their studies under the best masters.\\"The West Australian, 24 December 1908 Alice took private lessons from Signor Moretti of the Royal Academy of Music, and achieved high praise from Madame Mathilde Marchesi of Paris.The West Australian, 20 February 1909 The Corricks returned to Perth in June 1909, and immediately set out on another Australian tour, their longest yet, taking in the Western Australian goldfields, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. In November 1912, the youngest daughter, Elsie, finally joined the family, making it complete for the first time since their early tours in New Zealand.The Brisbane Courier, 25 January 1912 After leaving school in New Zealand in 1910, Elsie had trained at the Garcia School of Music in Sydney, under the director Madame Ellen Christian, Nellie Melba's first teacher.The Hobart Mercury, 9 June 1937 Elsie rapidly became the star of the Corrick performances after Alice left the tours in 1913. =Farewell New Zealand Tour= Following Albert's death in March 1914, the family made a final tour of New Zealand. They were warmly welcomed by audiences, but were by now sharing the programme with various other performances.NZ Evening Post, 28 December 1914 This 'farewell tour' lasted until July 1915, when the family, exhausted by years of almost continuous performance, decided to settle in Launceston, in Tasmania.NZ Evening Post, 24 July 1915 Advertising It was during the early New Zealand tours that Albert realized the power of advertising, and started to give audiences plenty of advance notice of their upcoming performances. Initially these were restrained and simply informative,NZ Ellesmere Guardian, 16 October 1897NZ Evening Post, 22 September 1899 but later became less modest.NZ Marlborough Express, 8 June 1900 On tour in Australia, their advertising ranged from a beautifully crafted piece for a charity concert,Hobart Mercury, 10 May 1902 to some unashamedly vaudevillian promotion.Hobart Mercury, 26 April 1902 'Leonard's Beautiful Pictures' Leonard Corrick developed an early interest in photography, and while he was still in his teens he convinced his father to purchase a magic lantern projector. By 1900 this was being used during family performances to provide a backdrop picture for certain songs, and proved popular with audiences.NZ Poverty Bay Herald, 14 December 1900 In January 1901, encouraged by this success, the Corricks obtained an Edison projector and a small collection of moving films. Leonard, still aged just 14, maintained and operated this equipment, and the Corrick advertising was soon promoting \\"Leonard‚Äôs Beautiful Pictures\\" (also named \\"Leonard‚Äôs Bioscope Pictures\\" and \\"Leonard‚Äôs Biograph Company.\\") By 1906, the Corricks had ordered a portable electricity generator to provide them with improved stage and projection lighting. This also allowed them to lure a larger audience in country towns, as they would shine bright lights into the night sky, attracting curious customers from surrounding areas. During their travels, the Corricks would also make their own films. One of their earliest, filmed in March 1907 in Perth, Western Australia, was \\"Street Scenes in Perth\\";Perth Street Scenes description this was shown during their performance the same evening, allowing amazed patrons to see themselves on film. A month later, they filmed a short comedy farce, \\"Bashful Mr. Brown\\", featuring family members as actors. While on their way back to Australia from Britain, aboard the SS Runic in 1909, they filmed \\"Sports and Play at Sea\\", again featuring themselves as well as other passengers and crew. \\"The Day-Postle Match\\" became one of their most successful films, featuring a running contest between Australian sprint champion Arthur Postle and Irishman J.B Day, held in Kalgoorlie on 10 April 1907. When shown locally, Postle himself came to see it, and was invited onstage by the Corricks to address the audience. This film remained popular for some time.Kalgoorlie Western Argus, 7 May 1907 After the family ceased touring, the Corrick film collection was held by Corrick descendants in Launceston for many years, until it was passed to the Australian National Film and Sound Archive, which undertook extensive preservation work on the collection.The Corrick films were all nitrate based, and as such had a limited storage life. After the Tours Ethel was the first of the Corrick daughters to marry, falling in love with the family advance agent, Harold George Coulter.Much to the delight of Sarah, Coulter proposed to the auburn-haired Ethel by moonlight at the Taj Mahal in India, according to Elsie‚Äôs memoirs. They married in November 1912, but Ethel continued to tour with the family, appearing under her maiden name. Harold and Ethel had two sons. After Harold's sudden death in 1919 from food poisoning,The West Australian, 2 June 1919 Ethel briefly became a confectioner, but then took up teaching and playing the violin. She died many years later in Launceston in June 1971. In February 1913 Alice married Launceston businessman William Edward Sadleir, a land agent, in Bunbury, Western Australia.The West Australian, 1 March 1913 After a short holiday in Cottesloe in Perth, they departed the state to travel to Launceston, where they established their home.

She formed a Ladies Choir and taught at the Broadland House School in Launceston. She died in Heidelberg in Victoria in 1956. Albert suffered a heart attack in Western Australia in 1913, and had to substantially cut his touring involvement. He died in Launceston in March 1914.The West Australian, 3 April 1914 Sarah outlived him by many years, and set up a large communal home for herself and several of her children in St. John Street in Launceston.

His 1960s and early 1970s songs, \\"Love, Love, Love\\", \\"You Got to Me\\" and \\"Reach Out\\", achieved local chart success in Australia and New Zealand. He launched AC/DC at Chequers on New Year's Eve 1974 and later became a publisher and music producer in Australia. His more recent business ventures include the acquisition of the Peter Lik Publishing Group, founding the Lifestyle Music label distributed by Sony Music Australia, and founding Music Hive, an online streaming service for retailers. Biography Gene Pierson was born Giancarlo Salvestrin (29 April 1946) in Venice. In 1949 his father, Ernesto, migrated to Australia and in January 1950, at the age of four, Pierson and his mother followed, settling in Griffith, New South Wales. =Early career= In 1963 Pierson, under the stage name Gene Chandler, won a talent quest at Skelseys Hotel, singing \\"Mashed Potato\\", in the western suburbs of Sydney, which was the beginning of his career in the entertainment business. He was given a regular solo spot at the hotel, where he was approached by guitarist Graham Ford to become the fifth member of a Western Suburbs band, The Inturns. The Inturns were subsequently managed by Eileen Harrigan, the wife of John Harrigan, who owned Surf City in Kings Cross and managed a number of leading \\"beat\\" bands in Sydney. The Inturns supported a number of popular local acts, including Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs, and Ray Brown & The Whispers as well as headlining at Suzi Wong's The Beach House and Stagecoach venues. Pierson was then offered a six-month resident spot at The Bowl nightclub in Pitt Street, Sydney. In December 1965 Pierson received news that his father, Ernesto, had a brain tumour and meanwhile Pierson was due to be conscripted into the army to serve in Vietnam. He was due to report to Duntroon military base within days however, following advice from The La De Das guitarist Kevin Borich, he travelled to New Zealand, which had no passport requirement, thereby evading his conscription. Running low on cash in Auckland, he bluffed his way into the Galaxie nightclub, saying he was Gene Chandler, a top performer from Sydney, and would do a guest spot for free entry. In the audience was Eldred Stebbing who managed and recorded Ray Columbus, Max Merritt & The Meteors and the La De Das on his Zodiac label. Gene Pierson on Bandstand in 1970 Stebbing was impressed and ended up managing Pierson encouraging him to change his stage name as there was already a US singer named Gene Chandler (aka \\"Duke of Earl\\"). The story is that Stebbing spotted a poster for Pearson's Soap over the singer's shoulder and both agreed with a change in spelling to Pierson. After signing with Stebbing's Zodiac label, temporary accommodation was arranged and Salvestrin (now Pierson) had a regular gig and income. He also appeared regularly with Wellington group, Cheshire Katt. Pierson had success with a Bobby Hebb song, \\"Love, Love Love\\"/\\"Celeste\\", which become a number one hit on the Radio Hauraki charts in October 1967. This was followed by \\"You Got To Me\\"/\\"Rainy Day in June\\" which reached number two spot. This was first time anyone had done a cover version of a Neil Diamond song outside of the US ‚Äì a medal commemorating this was later presented to Pierson by Diamond's manager. Both singles were also released in Australia on the Philips label. In 1968 Pierson released, \\"Toyland\\"/\\"Matchstick in a Whirlpool\\", which originally recorded by UK group Alan Bown Set featuring Robert Palmer on vocals, which was then followed later that year by \\"If You Only Loved Me\\"/\\"Just One Tender Look\\", neither of which had the same success as the earlier singles. Cover of Spinning the Moments by Gene PiersonPierson was featured in Playdate, Groove and a number of women's magazines, alongside the British and American pop stars of the time. He was working four nights a week, regularly appearing on television and touring with artists including Tommy Adderley, Larry's Rebels, Shane, The Chicks, Simple Image and the La De Das. In 1969 he switched labels to Festival Records releasing \\"Leaving on a Jet Plane\\"/\\"I Ain't No Miracle Worker\\" and in 1970 a cover of the Four Tops song \\"Reach Out\\"/\\"Oh Sweet Lord\\", which received airplay in Australia and became a minor chart success over there, reaching No. 12 on the Sydney charts. =Returning to Australia= During the recording of an album with producer and blind keyboard player Claude Papesch, Gene Pierson learned of his father's death and returned to Australia for the funeral. He quickly leveraged his New Zealand success, signing with Festival Records and releasing a psychedelic make-over of the Four Tops song \\"Reach Out\\", backed by New Zealand's Simple Image who were resident in Sydney at the time. However, a long-standing disagreement between radio stations and record labels put an end to the song's journey up the charts. Record companies were refusing to supply free new release records unless radio stations agreed to pay a new royalty, resulting in a six-month radio ban on airplay for Australian and British recordings released by major labels. As part of his contract Pierson released \\"See My Way\\"/\\"Teach Me How To Fly\\" on the Infinity label in 1970, followed in 1971 by \\"Story\\"/\\"Bye Bye Love\\" and \\"Come on In\\"/\\"The Only Living Boy in New York\\". He then ended his contract with Festival and went on to co-host the nationwide weekly pop gossip programme the Today Show with Bruce Webster and Patty Lovell, which led to the first video music TV show on Channel 7 called Sounds. The same year, he also hosted his own weekly segment, Today Pop, on Channel 7‚Äôs Today Show and wrote for Go-Set pop paper. For the publication he covered Elton John's first concert at the Troubador in Los Angeles, interviewed musicians Lou Rawls and Tina Turner, and promoted his version of \\"The Only Living Boy in New York\\", taking guest spots on the casino circuit in Los Angeles and San Francisco and appearing on Metro Media TV. = Record production = Pierson discovered there was an upside to the 1970 music ban that so harshly impacted local artists recording their own material. Australian acts could still cover versions of British hits that might otherwise be ignored. To capitalise on that loophole he formed Chart Records which released a number of songs, including a cover by Sydney band, Autumn of Christie's \\"Yellow River\\", and their collaboration with Dave Allenby of Edison Lighthouse's \\"She Works in A Woman's Way\\", which both reached the top ten on the local music charts. Also achieving chart success was a re-release of his earlier single, \\"Love, Love, Love\\", which reached No. 38 on the Go-Set Australian National Charts in May 1970. Concurrently Pierson became entertainment manager for John Harrigan's Sydney Bistros, which operated the largest nightclubs in Australia including Whiskey Au Go Go, Chequers and Stagecoach in Sydney. He booked Sammy Davis Jr, Frank Sinatra, Shirley Bassey, Trini Lopez and Dusty Springfield. When interest in middle of the road artists began to recede, Pierson championed a move to bring rock and roll into the clubs. He stimulated the success of a new wave of bands including Lobby Loyde & the Coloured Balls, John Paul Young, Jeff St John, Blackfeather, Cold Chisel, Sebastian Hardie and Chain. He established new groups at Chequers including Sherbet who soon moved from house band to main drawcard. In 1995, Gene Pierson and Village People‚Äôs drummer Allen Murphy visited Maningrida, an Australian Aboriginal community in Arnhem Land where they recorded indigenous talent such as the Sunrise Band, the Mimi Dancers, and the Letterstick Band. A limited edition compilation album was released on Pierson‚Äôs label Ocean Music that year. In January, 2016, the recording was remastered for the album ‚ÄúDemurru Hits‚Äù. =Booking agent= Pierson booked shows for AC/DC who were being promoted by Ray Arnold and his partner Alan Kissack. The band were booked into Chequers nightclub,. however, venue management had never heard such a loud band and refused to have them back. Pierson booking them at various venues including the Bondi Lifesaver at 56 Ebley St. Bondi Junction. He played a role in having Ted Albert of Albert Productions listen to AC/DC, who later signed with Albert Music. Pierson introduced the band to programme director of rock station 2SM, Rod Muir, who booked them for the station's school holiday concerts back at Chequers. Pierson managed Johnny O'Keefe for a time, running a series of sell out rock and roll concerts at Paddington Town Hall which featured a range of guest artists including Ray Columbus, Johnny Devlin, Jade Hurley and Judy Stone. During his time working with Sydney Bistros, Gene Pierson was introduced to British entrepreneur as an agent to rock bands including English band Black Sabbath, Don Arden, the father of Sharon Osbourne, who was at the time managing Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) and booking acts through Chequers nightclub. Ardern had heard the song Love and Other Bruises by Air Supply and wanted access to them. Pierson brokered a deal between Ardern and the band's management resulting in the band heading to US where they had strong chart success. Around this time Pierson reconnected with members of his former band The InturnsMcFarlane . Retrieved 8 March 2010. who had engaged guitarist Mario Millo (ex-The Click) as the band's keyboard player and changed their name to Sebastian Hardie. He managed the symphonic rock unit and booked them to tour Australia with Dutch progrockers Focus. This helped the band achieve national exposure and led to the recording of the band's successful debut album, Four Moments in August 1975. During this period Pierson had a regular showbiz column in the Sunday Mirror called \\"As It Is\\". The most important rock festivals in Australia during the 1970s were the four Sunbury Festivals held in a natural amphitheater outside Melbourne. The organizer, Odessa Promotions, hired Gene Pierson to co-compare the 1974 Sunbury Festival. This was the year that Pierson introduced Britain's up-and-coming group Queen to a hostile audience who were chanting for Australian artists. Queen finished their set despite being booed. =Record labels= Pierson established his own agency called Blue Heaven, booking top Australian bands around Sydney pubs and clubs. He then merged this with a new publishing operation run out of Kerry Packer's Nine Network in Sydney. It was here that the Living Sound and Laser Records labels handled artists including Dark Tan, Geeza, Squeeze, Bobby Thomas, Trevor Knight, Julie Bower, Frankie Davidson, Australia and Southern Cross. In the late-1970s he arranged a contract with established singer Judy Stone for concerts in Beijing resulting in strong record sales throughout mainland China. He also brokered a deal between INXS band manager Chris Murphy and Morrie Smith of RCA for international distribution. Pierson produced and recorded all-girl group Peaches single, \\"Substitute\\", which peaked at number 15 on the Kent Music Report in 1978 on the Laser Records label. Pierson purchased the rights for the Laser label and struck a distribution deal with Eldred Stebbing and Polygram Records. Pierson released the music of Th' Dudes and Hello Sailor in Australia through the Big Mouth label and launched their careers in Australia with an appearance at the opening of Sydney radio station 2WS. Pierson produced two hit singles for singer Melissa Tkautz from the TV series E Street, released on his Laser Music label through Polygram. He had the single \\"Read My Lips\\" written for her by Roy Nicholson which became an Australian Recording Industry Association's dance hit, reaching No. 1 on the ARIA singles charts, selling 800,000 copies. The follow-up single, \\"Sexy (Is The Word)\\", also written by Nicholson reached No. 3 on the Australian charts. Pierson was also behind the group Rhapsody, whose song, \\"Cowboy Lover\\", reached No. 95 on the ARIA singles charts in January 1993. In 1995 Ladysmith Black Mambazo released their album Homeless in Australia on Pierson's Laser Music label in conjunction with distributor Dino Entertainment. The South African choral group rose to prominence after working with Paul Simon on his 1986 album, Graceland. Homeless went platinum, selling 80,000 copies after Pierson struck a deal with a national advertising company for one of the tracks, \\"Nomathemba\\", to be used in an advertisement for Nestl√©'s Nescaf√© Gold Blend. In August 1996, following discussions with musician David Hudson, and his manager and wife, Cindy Hudson, Pierson formed the Indigenous Australia record label.Australian Music Online, Indigenous Australia entry. Archived from the original on 22 November 2005. Retrieved 17 July 2013. The label specialises in Aboriginal, spoken word, world, ambient music and children's albums and has released over twenty albums for artists including Hudson, Tjapukai, Ash Dargan and guitarist Wayne Mcintosh, with over one million units sold globally. and fights to uphold the rights of indigenous musicians. =Comedy recordings= Early in the 1980s Pierson, was inspired to delve into the relatively untapped comedy market after meeting Englishman Roy Nicolson in 1982, who was the songwriter for Toto Coelo's \\"I Eat Cannibals\\", which reached No. 4 on the Australian singles charts and No. 2 on the New Zealand singles charts. Nicolson had begun experimenting with animal sounds on an E-mu Emulator I, an early sampler. Pierson jokingly asked him if he could play \\"Paperback Writer\\" using dogs barking. He did and soon Pierson had commissioned him to create a parody album of popular Beatles songs with dogs plus a backing chorus of cows, sheep and chooks backed by anonymous backing musicians from Germany. The result was the 1983 novelty album, Beatle Barkers, credited to The Woofers and Tweeters Ensemble, released on the Passport Records label and marketed by Demtel. Pierson subsequently arranged for live recordings of Australian comedy acts at the Margaret St Comedy Store in Sydney in conjunction with Barry Wayne. The first series, Australia Laughs, featuring George Smilovitch, Rodney Rude, Vince Sorrenti, Keith Scott, Gary Who, Calvin De Grey and Graham Pugh, was released on video by Video Classics. =A Swag of Aussie Poetry= He recorded 53 of the best loved works of Australian prose and verses, entitled Out of the Bluegums ‚Äì 150 Years of Australian Verse, which was released in 1985. It features 31 narrators delivering an eclectic mix of folk ballads and bush poetry from the 1800s through to 20th century prose. The narrators include Australian icons such as Peter Allen, Spike Milligan, Dame Joan Sutherland, and Dame Edna Everage. The double CD was digitally remastered and released on Pierson's Lifestyle Music label in January 2011 as A Swag of Aussie Poetry. =Unfinished business= In 2001 he married Sharon Salvestrin, an ex-flight attendant who worked for Ansett Australia for 7 years.https://www.sharonsalvestrin.com They together opened the East Bedarra Island Retreat on Bedarra Island and Misty Mountains Nature Retreat in Mount Bellenden Ker. In November 2007 Pierson was invited to perform at the Wild Things beat band event in Auckland, where he sang alongside Ray Columbus, The Pleazers, Chants R & b, The Breakaways, and Peter Nelson & the Castaways and the Underdogs. In August 2008 Pierson finally released his debut album, the 16-track compilation Spinning the Moments, which he had begun in 1968. A distribution deal was signed with Sony/BMG in Australia and EMI Music in New Zealand for the album. In 2009, after 15 years with Indigenous Australia, Pierson merged the business into his Lifestyle Music Group making it easier to market the different styles of recording and artists he was working with and to expand into world music, sacred sounds, classical, poetry, ambient, jazz and health and lifestyle. In its first year Lifestyle Music Group recorded 50 albums including mellow jazz caf√© titles and \\"romance therapy\\" where he re-mastered older love songs, mixed with relaxing ocean sounds in-between. In 2010 Lifestyle signed Australia's Got Talent finalist Cam Henderson. Pierson produced Henderson's debut single, \\"Angel Without Wings\\" as well as the album of the same name for the 44-year-old builder. The album, Angel Without Wings, reached No.29 on the Australian ARIA albums chart in October 2010. In 2012 Pierson acquired the Peter Lik Publishing Group from renowned Australian photographer Peter Lik. In June 2012 Pierson's Lifestyle Music label, distributed by Sony Music Entertainment, made music history by having the first Australian Dance Chart album \\"Don't Funk With Me\\" by Alston which peaked at No.16 on the Australian charts and No. 2 ont he Australian dance music charts, spending a total of seven weeks in the charts. In February 2013 he re-mastered and re-released Norman May's Great Moments in Australian Sports a history of Australian sporting moments starting from the first Melbourne Cup phantom call by Joe Brown in 1890. In July 2014 he established Music Hive, a streaming music service for business environments. He continues to produce and record music tracks for his Lifestyle Music label distributed by Sony Music (SME). In 2019, he and his wife Sharon appeared on the second season of the Netflix series Instant Hotel.

Martyrdom and loyalty In pre-imperial China, the honest official Qu Yuan remonstrated with his king but was driven out of the court by vicious rivals. Rather than rebel, he drowned himself in the river, leaving behind hia poem, Li Sao (Encountering Sorrow). His failed attempt in 228 BCE to assassinate the King of Qin, who would become the First Emperor of China, made Jing Ke a martyr. In the Han dynasty, the court historian Sima Qian was also maligned by rivals and the Emperor Han Wudi sentenced him to either death by suicide or being castrated. He explained his choice of the second punishment in a famous Letter to Renan. He said \\"Now there is no man who does not naturally cling to life and avoid death, love his parents and cherish his wife and children. But the man who is devoted to the right sometimes has no choice but to behave otherwise.\\" Later generations viewed Sima as a martyr and loyal to his ideals. In the Song dynasty military official Yue Fei warned of the danger of invasion but was ignored, then put to death on spurious charges. Christian martyrs Christian missionaries and Chinese Christians were mostly accepted along with other religious persuasions but sometime accused of disloyalty. Government officials executed Christians in the 18th and 19th centuries for their refusal to renounce their faith, which the officials regarded as subversive. The largest number of martyrs were those killed by local groups in the Boxer Uprising, when some 30,000 Chinese citizens and foreign missionaries were killed because their faith was considered foreign.  Modern Development  Yu Peilun (1887 - 1911) who was martyred leading a suicide squad against Qing forces in the Xinhai Revolution. Revolutionaries of the Tongmenghui who died in attempts to overthrow the Qing dynasty were recognized as martyrs by the Republic of China after the Xinhai Revolution. During the Xinhai Revolution itself, many Chinese revolutionaries became martyrs in battle. \\"Dare to Die\\" student corps were founded, for student revolutionaries wanting to fight against Qing dynasty rule. Dr. Sun Yatsen and Huang Xing promoted the Dare to Die corps. Huang said, \\"We must die, so let us die bravely\\". During the revolution, suicide squads were formed by Chinese students going into battle, knowing that they would be killed fighting against overwhelming odds. The 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang died in the uprising that began the Wuchang Uprising, and were recognized as heroes and martyrs by the Kuomintang party and the Republic of China. Dare to Die student corps led by men like Chiang Kai-shek and Huang Shaoxiong with Bai Chongxi played a role in the attack against Qing forces in the Xinhai Revolution. The martyrs in the Dare to Die Corps who died in battle wrote letters to family members before heading off to certain death. The Huanghuakang was built as a monument to the 72 martyrs. The martyrdom of the revolutionaries helped the establishment of the Republic of China, overthrowing the Qing dynasty imperial system. \\"Dare to Die\\" corps continued to be used in the Chinese military. The Kuomintang used one to put down an insurrection in Canton. Many women joined them in addition to men to achieve martyrdom against China's opponents. The Kuomintang continued to promote the concept of martyrdom, the souls of Party martyrs who died fighting for the Kuomintang and the revolution and the party founder Dr. Sun Yatsen were sent to heaven according to the Kuomintang party. Chiang Kai-shek believed that these martyrs witnessed events on earth from heaven and he called on them for help. Coolies against the Communist takeover formed \\"Dare to Die Corps\\" to fight for their organizations, with their lives. During the Tiananmen Square Incident of 1989, protesting students also formed \\"Dare to Die Corps\\", to risk their lives defending the protest leaders. =Revolutionary martyrs in art= Two of the earliest revolutionary martyrs in Chinese culture were Liu Hulan, a 14-year-old school girl, and Jiang Zhuyun. Both were immortalized in operas - Liu Hulan (opera) and Sister Jiang respectively.  Islam  Islam has its own concept of martyrdom, which the Kuomintang promoted among Chinese Muslims through the Chinese Muslim Association. The Muslim General Ma Fuxiang stated on how Chinese Muslims were willing to die to accomplish tasks assigned to them. Imams sponsored by the Kuomintang called for Muslims to go on Jihad to become shaheed (Muslim term for martyr) in battle, where Muslims believe they will go automatically to heaven. Becoming a shaheed in the Jihad for the country was encouraged by the Kuomintang, which was called \\"glorious death for the state\\" and a hadith promoting nationalism was spread. A song written by Xue Wenbo at the Muslim Chengda school, which was controlled by the Kuomintang, called for martyrdom in battle for China against Japan. The Muslim General Bai Chongxi himself was a member of a Dare to Die corps in the Xinhai revolution.

It is distributed in southeastern North America, northeastern South America, Asia, and New Zealand, where it grows scattered or in groups on the ground, often at the base of oak and pine trees. The fruit body is characterized by the reddish-pink (or pinkish-tan to yellowish if an older specimen) scales on the cap that are often found hanging from the edge. The pore surface on the underside of the cap is made of irregular or angular pores up to 2 mm wide that bruise a blue color. It is yellow when young but ages to a deep olive- brown color. Microscopically, B. ananas is distinguished by large spores with cross striae on the ridges and spirally encrusted hyphae in the marginal appendiculae and flesh of the stem. Previously known as Boletus ananas and Boletus coccinea (among other synonyms), the species was given its current name by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909. Two varieties of Boletellus ananas have been described. Although the mushroom may be considered edible, it is not recommended for consumption. Taxonomy The species was first named by Moses Ashley Curtis as Boletus ananas in 1848, based on specimens he found near the Santee River, in South Carolina. In 1909, William Murrill described the new genus Boletellus and made Boletellus ananas the type species. According to Murrill, the taxon Boletus isabellinus, described by Charles Horton Peck in 1897 from specimens collected in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, is a synonym of B. ananas; Peck described this species from undeveloped specimens. Wally Snell later doubted Murrill's conclusion in a 1933 publication; he considered the differences in the spore structure too great to consider the species conspecific with B. ananas, although he admitted it was impossible to come to any definitive conclusions until mature fruit bodies and spore prints were available for study. Rolf Singer and colleagues (1992) suggested the name Boletellus coccineus for Boletellus ananas. Singer created this name, however, in the mistaken belief that the earliest available name for the taxon was Boletus coccineus, proposed by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. However, Fries‚Äôs name is an illegitimate later homonym (compare with Boletus coccineus, named by Bulliard in 1791), and Singer‚Äôs combination is actually based on Strobilomyces coccineus, named by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1888. The earliest available name for the species is therefore Boletus ananas M.A. Curtis 1848, the basionym of Boletellus ananas. Boletellus ananas, as the type species of the genus Boletellus, is in section Boletellus that Singer based on the scaly, dry cap with red-pink tones, a marginal veil that clasps the stem when immature, and longitudinally ridged spores that are greater than 16 Œºm long. The genus name Boletellus means \\"small boletus\\", while the specific epithet ananas alludes to the name for pineapple, referring to the pineapple-like pattern of scales on the cap surface. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"pineapple bolete\\". Description The cap of B. ananas is wide and plano- convex (flat on one side and rounded on the other). It is covered with squamules (small scales) that can be either pressed against the cap or curved back on itself. The squamules range in color from reddish brown to red-tan, to pink to pinkish gray, and they are more concentrated and more scaly in the center of the cap, extending out of cream to light orange-pink to light pink- red floccose ground. The margin clasps the stem when young; at maturity it separates into triangular veil remnants (appendiculae) that measure 6‚Äì12 by 3‚Äì10 mm. The color of these appendiculae range from buff-white to faint pink. The flesh is 2‚Äì3 mm thick at the edge of the cap, 7‚Äì10 mm over the tubes, and 11‚Äì18 mm centrally. It is buff white to light yellow, and quickly turns bluish upon exposure to air. The tubes are 1‚Äì5 mm long at the margin, 10‚Äì20 mm in the center, and 4‚Äì6 mm at the stem. They are broadly and deeply depressed around the stem, of irregular lengths, bright yellow to olive-yellow to mustard- yellow, and also rapidly turn blue upon exposure. The pores are the same color as the tubes, and rapidly turn blue-green with pressure; they are angular, and there are about 0.5‚Äì1.5 pores per mm. The stem is by wide, and gradually becomes larger towards the base to 10‚Äì19 mm. The top part of the stem is cream to pink, the middle finely longitudinally striate, with the striations darkening with handling, red-lavender to brown-red, lighter with age. Immediately above the basal tomentum the stem surface is cream-colored with few striations. The basal tomentum is made of stiff, coarse white hairs over the lower 6‚Äì50 mm. The flesh of the stem is solid (i.e., not hollow) white to buff-tan to light yellow, and turns slightly blue with exposure. The odor is not distinctive (although it has been described as \\"musty\\") and the taste is mild. =Microscopic characteristics= Closeup of cap surface revealing gradual differences in squamule structure and pigmentation progressing from the center of cap (top) to the margin The spores are olivaceous-brown in medium to heavy deposit. They are inamyloid, almond-shaped, contain one or more oil droplets, and measure 17.5‚Äì22.2 by 6.4-8 ¬µm. The spore wall is 0.5‚Äì1 ¬µm thick, with 12‚Äì14 longitudinal ridges. These ridges are less than 1 ¬µm tall, occasionally bifurcating, converging at poles, with minute cross-striae. Although these cross-striae are visible when observed with light microscopy, they are not evident when viewed with scanning electron microscopy. The hilar appendage (the region of a spore which attaches to the basidium via the sterigma) is 0.3‚Äì1 ¬µm long. The basidia are four-spored, club-shaped, and have numerous refractive globules; they measure 39‚Äì57 by 11‚Äì15 ¬µm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of a gill) are 42‚Äì47 by 8-12 ¬µm, swollen and beaked, slightly capitate. They are abundant, arising from the subhymenium, projecting 19.3‚Äì29.6 ¬µm above the hymenial palisade, thin-walled, hyaline, and devoid of refractive contents. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of a gill) are 19‚Äì42 by 5‚Äì11 ¬µm, swollen, cylindrical to narrowly cub-shaped, thin-walled, and infrequent. The flesh of the hymenium is boletoid and strongly divergent (composed of different tissue layers). The mediostratum (middle tissue layer) is 24.7‚Äì45.7 ¬µm wide, and made of many parallel, slightly interwoven hyphae. The lateral stratum hyphae are 4.4‚Äì8.4 ¬µm wide, hyaline, gelatinized in a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH), and regularly septate. The cap cuticle is a densely interwoven trichodermial palisade (an erect, roughly parallel chains of closely packed cells) of cylindrical elements with inflated terminal cells. The terminal cells are 23.5‚Äì51.9 by 9.4‚Äì16.8 ¬µm, inamyloid, cylindrical to club-shaped, interwoven, and concentrated on the squamules. The marginal appendiculae are composed of wefts of interwoven inflated hyphae, some with faint golden spirally arranged encrusting pigments that are evident when mounted in water, KOH, and Melzer's reagent. The flesh of the cap is composed of highly interwoven hyphae measuring 7.4‚Äì11.1 ¬µm wide that are hyaline in water, gelatinized and hyaline in KOH, and regularly septate. The stipitipellis (stem cuticle) is a trichodermial palisade of cylindrical elements with inflated terminal cells. The terminal cells project 30.4‚Äì63 ¬µm, and they are cylindrical to club- shaped, occasionally with an abrupt tapering point. The flesh of the stem is made of densely interwoven hyphae that are 4.9‚Äì7.2 ¬µm wide, with spirally arranged, faint golden encrusting pigments that can be seen in KOH, Melzer's reagent, and water. Clamp connections are absent in this species. =Varieties= The typical variety of Boletellus ananas has consistently larger fruit bodies than B. ananas var. minor Singer from Brazil and Nicaragua, and lacks the thick-walled cheilocystidia of B. ananas var. crassotunicatus Singer from Nicaragua and Panama. =Edibility= Although the mushroom is used as a food in Mexico, field guides list it as \\"inedible\\" or \\"not recommended\\". Similar species Boletellus ananaeceps Strobilomyces strobilaceus is roughly similar in appearance because of its rough scaly cap and lacerated margin, but may be distinguished from B. ananas by smooth stem without a ring, different spores, and flesh that is less tough. The Australian species Boletellus ananaeceps has spores with narrow longitudinal ribs that do not have cross-striae. B. dissiliens has colors that are not red as in B. ananas, and pores that can become reddish in maturity. Further, the cap flesh of B. dissiliens turns blue upon exposure to air. Ecology, habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of B. ananas typically grow scattered or in groups under oak and pine trees, often on their bases. In Guyana, the mushroom typically fruits singly or in pairs within above ground level on the trunks of the tropical tree Dicymbe corymbosa (subfamily Caesalpinioideae), associated with ectomycorrhizas within humic accumulations. It is rarely found fruiting on the ground on heavily decayed, root-penetrated wood. Rolf Singer suggested that the fungus was not mycorrhizal, noting that as well as occurring under or on the bases of both pine and oaks, it occurred in scanty humus and debris accumulated on rock walls. Singer concluded that the species prefers to grow on hard surfaces. Harry D. Thiers, in his study of the bolete flora of Texas, wrote that B. ananas was a rare species that often fruited abundantly following an extended period of rain and high humidity. Some varieties of B. ananas from southeastern North America, Costa Rica, Brazil, Panama, Nicaragua, and Guyana have been noted to fruit on tree trunks, although terrestrial fruiting has been reported in Malaysia and Central America. Due to the typically elevated fruiting habit and occurrence on dead wood, the ectomycorrhizal status of B. ananas has been debated; in the protolog Murrill noted \\"it always occurs either as a wound parasite on pine trunks or about the base of living pine trees.\\" All collections have been made in association with ectotrophic host trees including Pinus and Quercus species in southeastern North America and Central America, Quercus humboldtii in Colombia, various Fagaceae and Dipterocarpaceae species in Malaysia, and Leptospermum and Pinus species in New Zealand. In Guyana, the humic deposits on Dicymbe trunks bearing B. ananas are consistently permeated with abundant ectomycorrhizas. The fungus was reported as forming mycorrhizal associations with eucalypts in Australia, based on fruit body association with trees. Its North American distribution encompasses a range extending north from North Carolina to Florida, west to Texas and south to Mexico, and Central America. In 2008, it was reported for the first time in the Upper Potaro and Upper Ireng River Basins in Guyana. It has also been collected from New Zealand, Asia (including China, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan), and possibly Australia.

After a 4-month beta period, Sparrow went on sale in the Mac App Store on February 9, 2011 and became the top paid and top grossing app in less than one day. On July 20, 2012, the company announced that it had been acquired by Google and was ceasing continued development of the application except for critical bug fixes. Versions =Desktop= Sparrow uses a simplified user interface reminiscent of Twitter clients such as Tweetie or iOS apps, as opposed to a more traditional email style such as Apple's Mail or Mozilla Thunderbird. Sparrow currently works with Gmail and Google Apps accounts, along with other IMAP email accounts. It also includes features such as drag-and-drop attachments, Dropbox or Box.net support for uploading attachments, Growl support, Gmail labels and keyboard shortcuts, as well as quick replies, threaded replies and easy switching between accounts. =iPhone version= In March 2012, Sparrow for iOS was released in the App Store.  Acquisition by Google  On July 20, 2012, Sparrow and Google jointly announced that Sparrow had been purchased by Google and the company's employees would be added to their Gmail team. Due to this, they also announced that development of both of Sparrow's apps would be ended except for critical bug fixes. The purchase and subsequent discontinuation prompted criticism from some tech sites, who were uncertain about the future of the apps. Sean Gallagher of Ars Technica wrote he was concerned for the app's future given Google's previous history of buying out and subsequently abandoning development on other startups such as reMail, Meebo and Quickoffice. Rafe Needleman of CNET wrote that the purchase combined with the ceasing development of Mozilla Thunderbird meant there was a growing lack of quality desktop mail clients. Rob Beschizza of Boing Boing created a satirical video instructing users to prepare for the acquisition by deleting the app from their computer. However, TIME noted that the acquisition may lead to better apps for Gmail. Adrian Covert of Gizmodo expressed excitement about a possible official desktop client for Gmail.  Related development  In 2014, Google released Inbox by Gmail, an email app with functionality similar to Sparrow. Inbox was shut down by Google on April 2, 2019.

Roshek Professor of Physics, Applied Physics, and Bioengineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Roukes earned B.A. degrees in physics and chemistry (double majors) in 1978 at University of California, Santa Cruz, with highest honors in both majors, he received his Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 1985. His graduate advisor at Cornell was Nobel Laureate, Robert Coleman Richardson. Roukes‚Äô thesis research at Cornell elucidated the electron-phonon bottleneck at ultra low temperatures; the hot electron effect that is now recapitulated in texts on solid state transport physics. Stated in simplest terms, when electrons carry current in normal conductors, they heat up. At low temperatures and, now, in nanoscale devices at ordinary temperatures, their ability to dissipate this heat can be significantly impaired. This has generic implications for the operation of powered nanodevices. After earning his Ph.D., Roukes spent seven years as a Member of Technical Staff / Principal Investigator in the Quantum Structures Research group at Bell Communications Research in New Jersey, focusing on mesoscopic physics of electron transport in nanostructures. Roukes left Bellcore to become a tenured Associate Professor of Physics at Caltech in 1992, rising to full professorship in 1995, and subsequently became Professor of Physics, Applied Physics, and Bioengineering in 2000. Upon moving to Caltech, his principal research focus changed to nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). As the earliest pioneer in this field, DARPA engaged Roukes to organize the first international workshop on NEMS in 1999,(1st) DARPA Workshop on Nanoelectromechanical Systems, San Diego, CA, 22‚Äì23 April 1999. followed by a large international conference and school on nanoscale and molecular mechanics in 2002.1st International Conference and School on Nanoscale/Molecular Mechanics (n/m^2), Maui, Hawaii, May 12‚Äì17, 2002 (funded by DARPA). The many alumni from his group continue to advance this field at major universities in the U.S. and abroad. Roukes' other research efforts at Caltech have focused on thermal properties of nanostructures, semiconductor spintronics, and, more recently, nanobiotechnology. In 2002 Roukes was named the founding Director of the Kavli Nanoscience Institute (KNI) at Caltech. After stepping down between 2006‚Äì2008, to focus on co-founding the international Alliance for Nanosystems VLSI (very large scale integration) and to pursue collaborative research on NEMS VLSI in connection with a Chaire d‚ÄôExcellence in Nanoscience in Grenoble (with scientists at CEA/LETI-Minatec), Roukes returned as co-Director of the KNI in 2008. Roukes was named a recipient of a National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award in 2010. In 2012 he was named Chevalier (Knight) of the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques by the Republic of France.http://consulfrance-losangeles.org/spip.php?article2111 Among his groups' principal achievements at Bell were observation of quenching of the Hall effect in a quasi-one-dimensional wire, elucidation of electron- boundary scattering in quantum wires, invention of \\"anti\\"-dotsRoukes, M.L & Scherer, A., Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. 34, 622(1989) and elucidation of commensurability effects in this system, first elucidation of chaotic transport in mesoscopic conductor, and direct measurement of the transmission matrix for a mesoscopic conductor. Among his groups' principal achievements at Caltech are development of the first nanoelectromechanical systems, measurement of the quantum of thermal conductance, first attainment of attogram mass resolution with a NEMS resonator,Roukes, M.L. & Ekinci, K.L, Apparatus and method for ultrasensitive nanoelectromechanical mass detection, U.S. Provisional Patent Application serial No. 60/288,741 filed on May 4, 2001; awarded as United States Patent 6,722,200, April 20, 2004 first measurement of nanodevice motion at microwave frequencies, discovery of the giant planar Hall effect in semiconducting ferromagnets, observation and control of a single domain wall in a ferromagnetic semiconducting wire, first demonstration of zeptogram-scale mass sensing, first coupling of a qubit to a NEMS resonator, and first demonstration of nanomechanical mass spectrometry of single protein molecules.

Subsequently, he organized TEDxCaltech: The Brain, which was held on January 19, 2013 at Caltech. Talks from these events can be found online. In 2002, with three other scientists, Roukes met with, Elias Zerhouni, the Director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the Directors of the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and several other NIH directors to propose what ultimately became the National Cancer Institute's Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer. In 2011, Roukes was one of the six scientists first advocating, to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), a large-scale U.S. national neuroscience project to accelerate technology for functional connectomics.Johnson, Carolyn (April 5, 2013). \\"Local Scientists on Brain Mapping Dream Team Reflect on Challenges, Opportunity\\".

Its goal is to prevent suicide among LGBT youth by having gay adults convey the message that these teens' lives will improve. The project has grown rapidly: over 200 videos were uploaded in the first week, and the project's YouTube channel reached the 650 video limit in the next week. The project is now organized on its own website, the It Gets Better Project, and includes more than 50,000 entries from people of all sexual orientations, including many celebrities;  the videos have received over 50 million views. A book of essays from the project was released in March 2011. The project was given the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Governor's Award at the 64th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for \\"strategically, creatively and powerfully utilizing the media to educate and inspire,\\" according to the academy's chairman and CEO Bruce Rosenblum. Project history Dan Savage (2005) The project was founded by Savage in response to the suicide of Billy Lucas and other teenagers who were bullied because they were gay or perceived to be, such as with Raymond Chase, Tyler Clementi, Ryan Halligan, Asher Brown, and Seth Walsh. Savage wrote, \\"I wish I could have talked to this kid for five minutes. I wish I could have told Billy that it gets better. I wish I could have told him that, however bad things were, however isolated and alone he was, it gets better.\\" In September, they launched their YouTube channel. A one-hour special aired on February 21, 2012, hosted by Savage. A second hour long \\"It Gets Better\\" special was aired on both MTV and Logo networks on October 9, 2012. On May 3, 2011, a video ad developed by Google Chrome was launched during an episode of Glee and later aired across the nation. Former U.S. President Barack Obama lent his voice to the movement against bullying and contributed a video on October 21, 2010, saying, \\"We've got to dispel this myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage; that it's just some inevitable part of growing up. It's not. We have an obligation to ensure that our schools are safe for all of our kids. And for every young person out there you need to know that if you're in trouble, there are caring adults who can help.\\" In March 2011, Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama hosted an anti-bullying conference. A viral response to the campaign posits that for some, \\"It Doesn't Get Better.\\" Critic Tavia Nyong‚Äôo has linked the project to an upward mobility available to an exceptional class of urban liberal gays. Criticism acknowledges that the project focuses on white, middle-class, and cisgender men, while largely ignoring the lives of genderqueer and transgender people, lesbians, people of color, and the lower- class. Embracing Intersectional Diversity Project is an alternative video campaign started by Latoya Peterson recognizing the influence of racism on homophobic bullying. Laurel Dykstra points out that American and Canadian Aboriginal youth may have a higher suicide rate than queer youth. The project operates as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.

It is supported by well-known members of the community including Ministers Kevin Rudd and Anna Bligh who have made their own YouTube videos. Rudd is quoted as saying \\"You have the strength of the Australian nation behind you\\", encouraging teenagers to feel comfortable in their own identity. Other Australian figures to have supported the regional project include Triple J, Telstra, Optus, Missy Higgins, Courtney Act and Kerryn Phelps. =Canada= One organization, It Gets Better Canada, created a 12-minute video which featured a number of Canadian LGBT public figures, including Deb Pearce, Rick Mercer, Rex Harrington, Ann-Marie MacDonald, Enza Anderson, Diane Flacks, Brad Fraser, Mark Tewksbury, George Smitherman, Peter Fallico, Laurie Lynd and the cast of 1 Girl 5 Gays, talking about their own experiences of coming out in a documentary interview format. In addition to the Trevor Project, this video also endorsed two similar Canadian services, Kids Help Phone and Toronto's Lesbian Gay Bi Trans Youth Line. A similar video was subsequently released by a group of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation employees, including national network figures such as Jian Ghomeshi, Sook-Yin Lee, W. Brett Wilson and Brent Bambury as well as numerous other staffers and freelancers, speaking about their experiences of bullying on a variety of issues, including sexuality, race and disability. Former politicians Michael Ignatieff and Jack Layton also released videos when they were in office. Following the 2011 suicide of Ottawa teenager Jamie Hubley, an It Gets Better- themed video dedicated to Hubley, filmed on Parliament Hill and featuring commentary by Parliament staffers, Conservative members of parliament including John Baird, Vic Toews, Lois Brown, Alice Wong, Mike Wallace, Rona Ambrose, Shelly Glover, Deepak Obhrai, Candice Hoeppner and David Sweet and Conservative Senator Don Meredith was posted to YouTube on October 20, 2011. Former law clerk for the Federal Court Josh D. Scheinert noted on The Huffington Post that many of the participant legislators in the video had voted against the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2005 and that a few had ties to anti-gay organizations, but he concurred with Dan Savage's opinion that the video was a first, but not final, step for the Conservative Party towards better relations with LGBT citizens in Canada. In addition, comedian Rick Mercer ‚Äî who had previously made an earlier, more lighthearted \\"It Gets Better\\" video ‚Äî devoted a weekly \\"rant\\" on Rick Mercer Report to an updated comment on the subject, making an impassioned plea for LGBT public figures to come out on the grounds that Hubley's death had made it unacceptable to stay silent anymore.\\"Rick Mercer's television rant against the bullying of gay teens goes viral\\".

The videos were inspired by an interview of Gabrielle Yong, a 21-year-old Malaysian openly bisexual student who attempted suicide while studying abroad in Massachusetts; while her attempt was due to the difficulty of adjustment in a different environment, she was inspired to contribute her own testimony in the vein of the project. =Paraguay= The Paraguayan versi√≥n was launched on December 10, 2013 as \\"Todo Mejora Paraguay\\" trying made diff√©rents with Chile version.

It is housed in the original general cargo shed which was brought out from England in kit form in 1877 and was erected at the landward end of the jetty. The jetty took only seven months to build and was completed in January 1878. Household goods for the early settlers in the town and surrounding farmlands were brought by steamers from Port Adelaide and stored in the cargo shed until the settlers‚Äô homes were completed. The first overseas sailing ship to come to Port Victoria was the Cardigan Castle. It loaded 1800 tons of bagged grain and sailed to Europe in February 1879. By 1883 twenty three sailing ships (windjammers) had anchored in the bay between Wardang Island and the mainland, some visiting more than once. This was the beginning of the bagged grain trade between the Spencer Gulf ports and the markets of Europe. Some of the exhibits inside the museum The heart and soul of the town was the grain trade. Farmers, grain agents, lumpers (the men who handled the bagged grain) and their families were vital to this. From November onwards the town bustled with activity as the grain was harvested and brought into the town. The bags of grain were built into huge stacks around the town to await the arrival of the sailing ships. When the ships arrived the bags were taken down the jetty and loaded onto small ketches and schooners which took the grain to the large ships at anchor in the bay. The present day museum has photographs, exhibits and DVD presentations highlighting these busy times. Many of the sailing ships which came to Port Victoria from the late 1920s sailed under the flag of Finland. By far the largest fleet of ships was owned by Gustaf Erikson whose home port was Mariehamn on the island of √Öland in Finland. With so many of his ships regularly visiting Port Victoria the town became known to them as the Mariehamn of the South. In 1934 there were only 26 commercial sailing ships left in the world and 17 of them came to Port Victoria during that year. Cape Horner Sign at Port Victoria Maritime Museum The visits of these magnificent sailing ships and the life at sea of the crews is also well documented in the present day museum. The journey from the port to Europe was eastwards in the Roaring Forties and Furious Fifties via Cape Horn. Voyages took anything between the record breaking 83 days by the Parma in 1933 to over 5 months ‚Äì depending on the ship, weather conditions and the skills of the captains and crews. The sailors who rounded Cape Horn were known as Cape Horners. Cape Horner Associations were set up in many countries around the world. The museum has signage and displays paying tribute to the Cape Horners and the Australian Cape Horners in particular. The era of the sailing ships finally came to an end in 1949 when the Pamir and Passat made the final commercial sailing voyage in the world by ships without auxiliary engines. The museum also is famous for its displays of shipwreck artifacts from around Wardang Island. The Wardang Island Maritime Heritage Trail exists on the sites of eight of the shipwrecks. There is also a First Encounters Display telling the story of the local Narungga aboriginal people and their culture, the charting of the Spencer Gulf by Matthew Flinders and Nicholas Baudin, as well as the setting up of the large sheep pastoral leases on the Yorke Peninsula in the nineteenth century.

A deal for the privately owned group, reportedly worth up to $10 billion, was expected to be announced sometime in the first half of 2013. On March 14, 2013 Anschutz announced that AEG was no longer for sale. In an interview, Anschutz stated that he had recently become \\"reengaged\\" in the business and also suggested the company had failed to receive bids nearing the $8 to $10 billion asking price. On the same day it was announced the sale had been called off, it was announced Leiweke would be replaced as President and CEO by AEG executive Dan Beckerman, who previously has served as both chief operating officer and chief financial officer. The change in leadership was attributed by some analysts as a reaction to the failure AEG experienced in attracting serious bidders during the sale process and its inability securing an NFL occupant for the Farmers Field, a proposed stadium next to L.A.

He is best known as a banking entrepreneur, having served as CEO of both ING Direct Canada and ING Direct USA. In July 2012, Arkadi founded his sixth banking startup, ZenBanx, and was serving as its CEO before selling the business to SoFi in February 2017. Kuhlmann received an Honors B.A. in business administration along with an MBA from the Richard Ivey School of Business. In 2010, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of Western Ontario for his contributions to the world of business strategy. Career Kuhlmann began his career as a business professor shortly after graduating from the University of Western Ontario. He soon gravitated to banking as an assistant director of the Institute of Canadian Bankers, and as a consultant for the banking industry. Between 1977-1984, Kuhlmann served as manager, assistant general manager, and then Vice President of Royal Bank of Canada in its corporate cash management and commercial banking marketing divisions. Kuhlmann served as president and CEO at Deak & Co. and Deak International from 1985-1993. Deak & Co. provided merchant and investment banking services. Deak International provided foreign exchange and precious metals trading and refining services. Kuhlmann reorganized Deak International's operations, re-launching the company in April 1986, expanding the company from 52 to 192 branches worldwide, and from 350 to 1,500 employees; achieving revenues of $1B wholesale and $2.5B retail, with an income of $70M. Kuhlmann oversaw the successful divestiture of Deak International in 1990. Following the divestiture of Deak International to North American Life, Kuhlmann served as president of North American Trust until 1996. Kuhlmann founded ING Direct Canada in 1996. He created the brand strategy, recruited the senior leadership team, and grew the bank from 1996 to 2000 serving as the bank's president and CEO. He then repeated this process in 2000, when he founded ING Direct USA and led its growth to become the largest savings bank and number one direct bank in the United States, with more than $90B in deposits and 7.8M customers. He instituted an annual vote where he asked his staff to \\"re-elect\\" him as CEO. He went on to write his book titled, Rock Then Roll: The Secrets of Culture Driven Leadership, to better understand how culture plays a driving force in modern corporations. In late 2009, as a condition of its government bailout during the financial crisis, ING Groep, the parent company of ING Direct Canada and USA, and the largest Dutch financial-services firm, agreed on a restructuring plan with the European Commission. The restructuring plan mandated that ING Groep sell its North American online banking operations, which included ING Direct USA and Canada. On June 17, 2011, ING Groep agreed to sell ING Direct USA, and its seven million customers, to Capital One Financial for $9.2B.

He traveled widely, painting seascapes, coastal and harbour scenes as well as some landscapes in Europe, the Caribbean, Venezuela, North America and Asia. Biography Fritz Melbye was born on 24 August 1826 in Elsinore, Denmark. He trained as a painter under his older brother, Anton Melbye and, in 1849, set off for the Danish West Indies, settling on Saint Thomas. There he met the young Camille Pissarro whom he inspired to take up painting as a full-time profession. Pissarro became his pupil as well as close friend. Camille Pissarro: Melby and Pissarro in their studio in Carracas, c. 1854 In April 1852, Melbye was on Saint Croix, preparing a trip to Venezuela. Pissarro decided to join him and they spent two years together in Caracas and the harbour city of La Guaira before Pissarro returned to Saint Thomas. Melbye stayed until 1856 and then briefly returned to Europe, living some time in Paris, before traveling to North America where he set up a studio in New York City. He continued to travel widely, mainly to the Caribbean but also north to Newfoundland. A close friend in New York and frequent travelling companion on his Caribbean travels was the famous American landscape painter Frederick Church who also had a studio in New York. In 1866, Melbye set off on a journey to the Far East in search of new adventures, leaving his studio in Church's care. In Asia he used Peking as a base for travels around the region which also took him to Japan. He died in Shanghai three years later. Works Fritz Melbye initially painted seascapes in the family tradition his brother had taught him, but he increasingly turned to landscapes, coastal and town views. He preferred a realistic style, often with romantic scenes. He exhibited at Charlottenborg in Copenhagen from 1849-1858. In Peking he was commissioned to paint the Imperial Summer Palace and during his years in America he exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art.

The term originated in traditional tabletop role- playing games where it applies to characters controlled by the gamemaster or referee rather than another player. In video games, this usually means a character controlled by the computer (instead of the player) that has a predetermined set of behaviors that potentially will impact game play, but not necessarily be true artificial intelligence. Role-playing games In a traditional tabletop role-playing game such as Dungeons & Dragons, an NPC is a character portrayed by the gamemaster. If player characters form the narrative's protagonists, non-player characters can be thought of as the \\"supporting cast\\" or \\"extras\\" of a roleplaying narrative. Non-player characters populate the fictional world of the game, and can fill any role not occupied by a player character (PC). Non-player characters might be allies, bystanders or competitors to the PCs. NPCs can also be traders that trade currency for things such as equipment or gear. NPCs thus vary in their level of detail. Some may be only a brief description (\\"You see a man in a corner of the tavern\\"), while others may have complete game statistics and backstories of their own. There is some debate about how much work a gamemaster should put into an important NPC's statistics; some players prefer to have every NPC completely defined with stats, skills, and gear, while others define only what is immediately necessary and fill in the rest as the game proceeds. There is also some discussion as to just how important fully defined NPCs are in any given RPG, but it is general consensus that the more \\"real\\" the NPCs feel, the more fun players will have interacting with them in character. =Playability= In some games and in some circumstances, a player who is without a player character of their own can temporarily take control of an NPC. Reasons for this vary, but often arise from the player not maintaining a PC within the group and playing the NPC for a session or from the player's PC being unable to act for some time (for example, because they are injured or in another location). Although these characters are still designed and normally controlled by the gamemaster, when players are given the opportunity to temporarily control these non-player characters it gives them another perspective on the plot of the game. Some systems, such as Nobilis, encourage this in their rules. In less traditional RPGs, narrative control is less strictly separated between gamemaster and players. In this case, the line between PC and NPC can be vague. =Dependents= Many game systems have rules for characters sustaining positive allies in the form of NPC followers; hired hands, or other dependent stature to the PC. Characters may sometimes help in the design, recruitment, or development of NPCs. In the Champions game (and related games using the Hero System), a character may have a DNPC, or \\"dependent non-player character\\". This is a character controlled by the GM, but for which the player character is responsible in some way, and who may be put in harm's way by the PC's choices. Video games The term non-player character is also used in video games to describe entities not under the direct control of a player. The term carries a connotation that the character is not hostile towards players; hostile characters are referred to as enemies, mobs, or creeps. In video games, NPC is sometimes expanded as \\"non-playable character\\" or \\"non-player class\\". NPC behavior in computer games is usually scripted and automatic, triggered by certain actions or dialogue with the player characters. In certain multi-player games (Neverwinter Nights and Vampire: the Masquerade series, for example) a player that acts as the GM can \\"possess\\" both player and non-player characters, controlling their actions in order to further the storyline. More complex games, such as the aforementioned Neverwinter Nights, allow the player to customize the NPCs' behavior by modifying their default scripts or creating entirely new ones. In some online games, such as MMORPGs, NPCs may be entirely unscripted, and are essentially regular character avatars controlled by employees of the game company. These \\"non-players\\" are often distinguished from player characters by avatar appearance or other visual designation, and often serve as in-game support for new players. In other cases, these \\"live\\" NPCs are virtual actors, playing regular characters which drive a continuing storyline (as in Myst Online: Uru Live). In early and less advanced RPGs, NPCs only had monologue. Code directs the appearance of a dialogue box, floating text, cutscene, or other means of displaying the NPCs' speech or reaction to the player. NPC speeches of this kind are often designed to give an instant impression of the character of the speaker, providing character vignettes, but they may also advance the story or illuminate the world around the PC. Similar to this is the most common form of storytelling, non-branching dialogue, in which the means of displaying NPC speech are the same as above, but the player character or avatar responds to or initiates speech with NPCs. In addition to the purposes listed above, this enables development of the player character. More advanced RPGs feature interactive dialogue, or branching dialogue (dialogue trees). A good example are the games produced by Black Isle Studios and White Wolf, Inc.; every one of their games is multiple-choice roleplaying. When talking to an NPC, the player is presented with a list of dialogue options, and may choose between them. Each choice may result in a different response from the NPC. These choices may affect the course of the game, as well as the conversation. At the least, they provide a reference point to the player of his or her relationship with the game world. Ultima is an example of a game series that has advanced from non-branching (Ultima III and earlier) to branching dialogue (from Ultima IV and on). Other role-playing games with branching dialogues include Cosmic Soldier, Megami Tensei, Fire Emblem, Metal Max, Langrisser, SaGa, Ogre Battle, Chrono, Star Ocean, Sakura Wars, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Radiant Historia, and several Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games. Certain video game genres revolve almost entirely around interactions with non-player characters, including visual novels such as Ace Attorney and dating sims such as Tokimeki Memorial, usually featuring complex branching dialogues and often presenting the player's possible responses word-for-word as the player character would say them. Games revolving around relationship-building, including visual novels, dating sims such as Tokimeki Memorial, and some role-playing games such as Shin Megami Tensei: Persona, often give choices that have a different number of associated \\"mood points\\" which influence a player character's relationship and future conversations with a non-player character. These games often feature a day-night cycle with a time scheduling system that provides context and relevance to character interactions, allowing players to choose when and if to interact with certain characters, which in turn influences their responses during later conversations. Insult On the Internet, NPC is often used as an insult to suggest that some people are unable to form thoughts or opinions of their own. Such people are often characterized as being similar to NPC Wojak, who is a grey-faced, expressionless internet meme.

Between 1960 and 1980 hundreds of Namibians came to GDR and were offered academic education. In 1978 many wounded SWAPO guerrillas came from Cassinga to GDR for medical treatment. The GDR offered what was termed \\"Solidarity Consignment‚Äú to South West Africans. Sam Nujoma turned again to the GDR and other socialist countries after the Cassinga massacre and asked again for children to be taken out of the SWAPO refugee camps for safety, support, and care. On 12 September 1979 Nujoma's request was granted by the SED's Central committee. Jagdschloss Bellin, a hunting castle in Bellin, a village ten kilometers south of G√ºstrow (today in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) was identified as a safe home for the children. Arrival On 18 December 1979 the first group of about 80 children arrived in the snowy winter in Bellin. Some were between the ages of 3 to 5 years old. Besides medical and general support it was agreed that German should be the medium of instruction for those in pre-primary and primary school. Between 1979 and 1988 a total of 430 black children came to the GDR. Due to inadequate space, the groups from 1979 to 1985 were moved to the School of Friendship in Sta√üfurt. The children were mostly pre-school war orphans. Some of them were selected from families of SWAPO functionaries, reportedly without the consent or consultation of their family members. The government of GDR saw the education of these children as one of their contributions to the international revolution. The first group of children that went in 1979, and were called later the \\"79ers,\\" spent eleven and a half years in the GDR. They went to school, learned German as a mother tongue, and basically grew up with a German lifestyle. German and Namibian teachers tried their best to sustain the Namibian culture with the teaching of traditional dances, Oshivambo songs, and traditional cooking. In the GDR, social and tertiary education was of utmost importance for the children. The education for the SWAPO Pionier aimed to place most of these youths in elite leadership positions for the development of the country once Namibia achieved its independence. Repatriation A few months after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, Namibia attained its independence. The event culminated in the repatriation of Namibian children and teachers from the GDR back to Namibia. There are a number of theories regarding the unexpected repatriation; at that point, an established parent committee requested the return of these children, as a symbol for a new Namibian government and to nullify the rumours that the SWAPO children were kidnapped. The repatriation of these children took place from 26‚Äì31 August 1990, landing in a homeland alien to them. The consequence was cultural shock: Though these youth were seen by the Namibian people as Germans, the Namibian German people regarded them to be \\"amazingly German‚Äú, though as black people. For the GDR children of Namibia, it meant a conflict between two home countries and two cultures, and a fight for two identities. Many of them returned into poverty and struggle instead of the expected leadership positions. Aftermath In the process of the children's homecoming to Namibia, the concept \\"ex-GDR children\\" was casually used along with the term \\"Ossis of Namibia‚Äú, as they sometimes regarded themselves as \\"Ossis\\". The Ossiclub of Windhoek that existed up to 2007 was a place where they regularly met.Ossi-Club und Karnevalsverein, Berliner Zeitung, 10 October 2006 Up to today, the concept of \\"GDR children\\" is a meaning that continues to have significance. As some of them went to good schools in Namibia and still have a good command of the German language in a country with a strong German influence, they stand to have good career opportunities. Unfortunately some still experience difficulties in the search for their own sense of home, culture, and identity. Today most of the ex-GDR children describe themselves as \\"Omulaule\\", a word in Oshivambo that means \\"black\\" or \\"black man\\". Their organization continues to operate under the name Freundeskreis ex-DDR, but it is largely dormant.  Current Situation  Since end of 2009 a group of Omulaule came under the spotlight through bad behaviour especially in Windhoek. They started collecting money in the form of donations for an apparent historical expedition from German tourists. Such expedition or project was never planned.Vor falschen Spendensammlern warnen, Allgemeine Zeitung, 16 February 2010 Neue Schau entpuppt sich als Flop, Allgemeine Zeitung, 1 March 2010Hercules Viljoen geht auf Distanz, Allgemeine Zeitung, 4 March 2010 In the arts =Films= *Omulaule means black, from the Bauhaus-Universit√§t Weimar (Fakult√§t Medien) developed a documentary film .

He served as Colonial Treasurer of Hong Kong from 1844 to 1845. He was a founding member of the Statistical Society of London (1834), the Colonial Society (1837), and the East India Association (1867). Biography =Early life= Robert Martin was born in Dublin, Ireland, into a Protestant family, the son of John Martin and Mary Hawkins; and trained as a doctor. About 1820 he went out to Ceylon, under the patronage of Sir Hardinge Giffard, a friend of his father. Travelling onwards to the Cape of Good Hope, where he arrived in June 1823; he joined the expedition of HMS Leven and HMS Barracouta under William Fitzwilliam Owen, bound for Delagoa Bay. Martin was temporarily appointed assistant surgeon, serving also as botanist and naturalist on the south-east coast of Africa, Madagascar, and Indian Ocean islands. On 10 November 1824 Martin left the expedition at Mombassa, and by way of Mauritius made his way back to the Cape. Later he set sail for New South Wales returning to India around the end of 1828. He lived there for a year, before sailing back to England in 1830. =Writer= Title page of The history, antiquities, topography, and statistics of eastern India (Vol. III) by Robert Montgomery Martin, published in 1838 Martin became a writer. According to his own account in 1840 he had been studying colonial questions for ten years. He published fifty thousand volumes on India and the colonies. In 1838 he was assigned an office in Downing Street, and in a year brought out his work on the Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire, compiled from official sources, but without official support. In 1840 he founded and for two years edited the Colonial Magazine. Opium in China, published in 1847 On 5 December 1837 he presented a petition to the House of Commons for an amended colonial administrative department. In 1839, as a member of the court of the East India Company, he was active in promoting the appointment of the commission which sat in 1840 on the East Indian trade. Martin was a prominent witness. =Official= In January 1844 Martin was appointed treasurer of the newly acquired island of Hong Kong, where he was also a member of the legislative council. He continued to write and was in poor health. In May 1845 he disagreed with the governor about raising revenue from opium and on being refused six months' leave, resigned in July 1845. In his reports he insisted that Hong Kong was as a British colony doomed to failure. After making unsuccessful efforts to induce the Secretary of State to reinstate him, Martin returned to a literary life, near London. In 1851 he went to Jamaica on a mission to report on the affairs of two mining companies operating there. =Family= Martin married Jane Avis Frances Keith in 1826. She eloped with Dr. John Sheridan (1805‚Äì1858) and emigrated to South Australia, where they were important colonists. In 1847 the marriage was dissolved by Parliament, and he married Eliza Barron, later as Eliza Phillips known in bird welfare. =Later life= Martin was one of the original members of the East India Association, founded in 1866. He died at Wellesley Lodge, Sutton, Surrey, on 6 September 1868.

Barney and the Larry H. Miller Communications Corporation. The series documented the creation of, and work involved in, the Joseph Smith Papers Project. It also discussed the history of Joseph Smith, the founder and first prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as well as the early history of the Latter Day Saint movement. Production The history of the Joseph Smith Papers Project began with the work of Dean C. Jessee. Jessee, along with LDS Historian Leonard J. Arrington, wanted to collect and publish all the known works of Joseph Smith, so they could be more easily accessed by scholars and the public. His first attempts at the project were The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith, in 1984, and the two volume Papers of Joseph Smith, the first in 1989 and the second in 1992. In 2001, Jessee's project became a joint venture between Brigham Young University and the LDS Church Archives, and was named the Joseph Smith Papers Project. A large amount of funding for the project was donated by Larry H. and Gail Miller the owners of KJZZ-TV, the station which would later air the television series. The project was then moved from BYU to the LDS Church Archives in Salt Lake City, Utah. As the project progressed, and the time neared for the publication of the first volume, the Larry H. Miller Communications Corporation decided to produce an hour-long introduction to the project, to air on KJZZ-TV. This introduction aired 5 November 2007, and became the pilot for the series. Eventually it was decided to create a weekly series, to document the project, and to discuss the history of Joseph Smith using original documents. The pilot would differ from the remaining episodes of the series because of changes to the production team and broadcast format. All the episodes were produced in cooperation with the LDS Church Historical Department. The first season of the series premiered early in 2008 and concluded on 22 February 2009. The second season began airing in 2009 and ended later that year. Following the completion of each season, the episodes were rebroadcast on BYU-TV (to receive exposure outside the Salt Lake City market). Both seasons were later released on region-all DVD. Plot synopsis and episode list The first season documented the creation of, and work involved in, the Joseph Smith Papers Project. It also discussed the history of Joseph Smith, the founder and first prophet of the LDS Church (using original documents); beginning with his ancestral roots and ending with the condition of the Church following his death. The second season covered many of the same topics, but went into more detail, using a topical approach versus the chronological approach of the first season. The second season also covered the potentially troubling issues in Joseph Smith's history more thoroughly. See also *The Joseph Smith Papers Notes References *.

The coup took place on 5 July 1973 and was considered by many as a betrayal.  Background  While still under Belgian rule in the 1950s and early 1960s, resentment towards colonial rule and the ethnic Tutsi elite among the Hutu had increased, and led to the formation of the political party Parmehutu by Gr√©goire Kayibanda in 1957, with aims to overthrow the monarchy and gain identical rights (\\"emancipation\\") for the Hutus. This was achieved following the 1961 election and referendum, but the absence of effective Tutsi opposition led to regional tensions between Hutu politicians. The central and southern politicians were opposed by those from the north. In the months prior to Habyarimana's coup, the Army (mainly composed by northern soldiers) had intensified persecution of ethnic Tutsi through the formation of Hutu vigilante committees to ensure enforcement of the required ethnic quotas requested by Habyarimana. Kayibanda refused this policy of quotas and was then described by the Army as a 'weak' leader. Fake rumors and documents were produced by the Army against the President and Rwanda became isolated economically and diplomatically, especially from neighbouring Uganda (then under the rule of Idi Amin) which housed large numbers of Tutsi. This situation was regarded by the majority of the population as a betrayal from Habyarimana. Indeed, prior to the coup Habyarimana, who served as Army Chief of Staff, was also a friend of president Kayibanda.  Aftermath  Juv√©nal Habyarimana, who took power in the coup, pictured in 1980 Immediately after seizing power, Habyarimana established a totalitarian dictatorshiphttps://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/92171/GS19.pdf and outlawed all political parties, but in 1974 created his own, the Mouvement R√©volutionnaire National pour le D√©veloppement (MRND), as the country's only legally-allowed party. While the coup itself was bloodless, fifty-six people ‚Äì mostly former leaders ‚Äì were killed by the security services between 1974 and 1977, with Kayibanda dying in detention in 1976, probably of starvation.

It is marketed as a program for search engine optimization and was created by BotmasterLabs. It is able to register and post to forums (forum spam) with the aim of boosting search engine rankings. The program is able to bypass security techniques commonly used by many forums and blogs to deter automated spam, such as account registration, client detection, many forms of CAPTCHAs, and e-mail activation before posting. The program utilises SOCKS and HTTP proxies in an attempt to make it more difficult for administrators to block posts by source IP and features a proxy checking tool to verify the integrity and anonymity of the proxies used. In addition, the software can avoid the suspicions of forum administrators by first registering to make a post in the form of a question which mentions the spam product (\\"Where can I get...?\\"), before registering another account to post a spam link which mentions the product. The side effect of these innocent-looking posts is that helpful forum visitors may search on a search engine (e.g. Google) for the product and themselves post a link to help out, thus bolstering the product's Google ranking without falling afoul of forum posting policies. The software is also capable of avoiding detection by making posts in off-topic, spam and overflow sections of forums thus attempting to keep its activities in high activity low content areas of the targeted forum. However, there are other platforms used to spam to which includes website comment spam.  Method of operation  XRumer is capable of posting to blogs and guestbooks in addition to its main role as an automated forum posting tool. It can also create forum profiles complete with signature in an attempt to avoid alerting forum administrators with any off topic forum posts. The software is also able to gather and decipher artificial intelligence such as security questions (i.e. what is 2+2?) often used by forums upon registration. Since the latest version of XRumer, the software is capable of collecting such security questions from multiple sources and is much more effective in defeating them. Helper program Hrefer is also included. This software is used to automatically parse results from search engines including Google, Yahoo, Bing and Yandex for forums and blogs that can then be used as a target list for the main XRumer application. According to The Register, as of October 2008, XRumer can defeat captchas of Hotmail and Gmail. This enables the software to create accounts with these free email services, which are used to register in forums that it posts to. XRumer also posts slowly initially, in an attempt to avoid detection by posting unnaturally fast. Between 2009 and 2011 XRumer no longer recognized Hotmail and Gmail captchas due to a change in captcha format. Users of XRumer could only defeat such captchas utilizing external human captcha services.  Defenses  Webmasters of topical forums face an ongoing battle against XRumer software, users of which are almost always in violation of forum terms of service, and/or have no interest in the actual forum topic. The users of the software have created an entire industry whose sole purpose is to protect internet sites against users of XRumer. Forum administration tasks against XRumer are often a constant, daily effort, which include identifying new user accounts that are from XRumer users, deleting posts/threads created by the software, and deleting/disabling the user accounts. The easiest method to defeat Xrumer is to simply require the first post of any new forum member or blog poster to be approved before it can appear. There are several resources that help block forum spam, which reference reports of forum spam by username and IP address. If a user/IP has appeared in the site's lists, it is highly likely that it is a black-hat user of XRumer. Common defensive actions by webmasters are to institute IP-based posting bans on subnetworks used by the spammers. The spam messages in a forum typically take the form of \\"link spam\\" which will often be included in older topics and private messages (PMs) leaving the newer threads and posted messages \\"clear\\" of apparent spam. Sophisticated spammers will copy posts from other areas of the site, giving the appearance of a valid, on-topic reply. The best clue that it is a spammer is that the links in the user profile are completely unrelated to the forum topic, and the posted messages, while seemingly within the general topic of the forum, will be non-sequiturs and out-of-place within the topic thread. Alternatively, the spammers post generic \\"I am excited to begin posting and contributing here.\\" messages that are content-neutral. The damage caused to forums is classified in several areas: first and foremost, the admin time to clean the forum; second, the server bandwidth to accommodate the spam postings; third, the storage requirements at the forum server for the spam messages that are devoid of content; fourth, the community alienation and irritation around seeing spam; fifth, the offense to innocent forum members if their posts are mistaken as spam or their accounts suspended in error for suspected spamming; and sixth, the lowering of the information-to-noise ratio of the forum, which diminishes the value of the forum, skewing usage/active user statistics used to determine advertising rates.  E-mail account creation  As per the latest update to XRumer 7 the software is able to automatically register e-mail accounts on mail.ru (Russian IP addresses only) and Gmail. Support for creating e-mail accounts in an automated fashion on Hotmail and AOL has been completely removed. The technique employed by XRumer to bypass the CAPTCHA protection in Gmail and mail.ru is Averaging. A captcha is a challenge-response test frequently used by internet services in order to verify that the user is actually a human rather than a computer program. Commonly, captchas are dynamically created images of random numbers and/or letters. These images are distorted in some way so that the human eye can still recognize them but with the goal to make automatic recognition impossible. Captchas are used by free-mail services to prevent automatic creation of a huge number of email accounts and to protect automatic form submissions on blogs, forums and article directories. As of November 2012, Xrumer has once again cracked Recaptcha, and is able to successfully post to Forums/Blogs that use it. Averaging is a common method in physics to reduce noise in input data. The averaging attack can be used on image-based captchas if the following conditions are met: The predominant distortion in the captcha is of noise-like nature. It is possible to extract a series of different images with the same information encoded in them. Averaging of a series of images can be used to improve image quality (reduce distortion, or improve signal-to-noise ratio, so to say) of captchas and hence to make them more easily recognizable by OCR (optical character recognition) systems. The fact that noise and payload behave differently on \\"reload\\" is exploited. This allows the program to separate them and hence defeat the captcha without the need for a sophisticated algorithm.

He is regarded by many as the best Turkish basketball player ever, with a total of 224 caps with the senior Turkish national team. He was Turkey's national team captain in 89 games, and he scored 2,195 points with the senior Turkish national team. With Turkey's national team, he won the gold medal at the 1981 Balkan Games, and the gold medal at the 1987 Mediterranean Games. On the club level, he won the Turkish League championship 6 times. Aydan was also the first Turkish basketball player to play on the FIBA European Selection (the All-European Team), in 1981, where he displayed a memorable performance in a game against the Spanish ACB League club Joventut Badalona.  Professional career  The ambitious Aydan started playing basketball in the youth ranks of Galatasaray Istanbul, when he was 16 years old. Because of his talent and ability, he was signed by Eczacibasi Istanbul, and he played with that club for several years. He earned himself a place on the FIBA European Selection (All-European Team), in 1981. He retired from playing pro club basketball in 1992, while he was a member of the Turkish club Tofas Bursa. = Domestic fame = Aydan is often cited as being the pioneer of Turkish basketball. He has a legendary status with Turkish basketball fans, and he is generally considered to be the top Turkish basketball idol of all time. Many basketball historians believe that Aydan was a very underrated player, and that he could have been among the most well- remembered European players of his time, if he had played in a bigger EuroLeague club than the ones he played in. During his playing career, Turkish club basketball lacked in quality, which caused Aydan to be relatively unknown outside of Turkey, at the time. National team career Aydan became a regular player of the senior Turkish national team, as he played at the 1975 EuroBasket and 1981 EuroBasket.

History and profile The magazine began life in February 1982 as a photocopied newsletter for firework enthusiasts. At the time, the number of British firework companies was in sharp decline and their tangible remains were being lost or destroyed. Fireworks was also intended to record the histories of these companies, firework celebrations and print readers' nostalgic recollections of Guy Fawkes' Night. Fireworks includes colour pictures of early British fireworks and celebrations, including displays for Guy Fawkes Night. The Letters page is a forum for debate, for instance the recent discovery of nineteenth century flares by the UK coastguard service, and the new Amberley firework museum. The magazine is in colour throughout, and pictures are of displays, events, and people as well as popular British fireworks from the 1930s to the 1970s. Pictorial matter includes cartoons (Sturtz, Fireworks' resident cartoonist among others). Some cartoons are historical. There is a once-a-year directory of firework companies; snippets of firework news in Round Up; and safety information and news which provide firers with the information they require to safely fire displays. Major events, both current and historical, are covered in articles, and there are profiles of prominent figures, as well as a hall of fame. The magazine's articles are written by notable figures in the firework industry and the firework world generally, including Reverend Ron Lancaster (author of Fireworks: Principles and Practice, an authoritative work for firework people), who has paid tribute to the magazine's work to preserve firework history in that book. The current issues are very different from the early stapled sheets, and the magazine is commercial in appearance. The magazine has had a part to play in the foundation of a firework museum, the formation of a family of firework collectors and admirers, and the presentation of fireworks as an acceptable form of enjoyment by responsible people aware of safety issues and determined to improve safety wherever possible.

The MikuMikuDance program itself was programmed by Yu Higuchi (HiguchiM) and has gone through significant upgrades since its creation. Its production was made as part of the VOCALOID Promotion Video Project (VPVP). Overview The software allows users to import 3D models into a virtual space that can be moved and animated accordingly. The positioning of the 3D figures can be easily altered, the facial expressions can be altered (as long as the model has morphs to use), and motion data can be applied to the model to make it move. Along with these functions for models, accessories, stages, and backgrounds can be added to create an environment, and effects such as lens flares and AutoLuminous (an effect that makes things glow and light up) can be applied as long as the MikuMikuEffect (MME) plugin is installed into the interface. Sound and music can also be added to create music videos, short films, and fan-made stories. The motion data used to animate the characters and the pose data mainly used for making screenshots can be exported as .vmd (Vocaloid Motion Data) files and .vpd (Vocaloid Pose Data) files, respectively. The exported files can then be imported into other projects made with software that can use the file types. This allows users to share the data with other users. The software also uses the Bullet physics engine. Users can also use Microsoft's Kinect for motion capturing. Map shadowing, screenshot rendering in several picture file formats and full movie rendering in the .avi file format are also possible. With the exception of a few models, stages, motion data and accessories that come with the software upon download, all content, including the 3D models, is distributed by the users, meaning all rules and restrictions (or lack thereof) vary greatly from case to case. Most models' rules may be found in its Readme file, which may be a .txt, pdf or a webpage file. The creator, HiguchiM, has stated he can make no promises regarding how other users' fan models can or cannot be used, and is exempt from all responsibility relating to this subject. Models created by other users are often available for public download. As MikuMikuDance is exclusively a posing and animation software, modelers use 3D modeling software, such as Blender or Metasequoia, to create the model and UV map, while the majority of conversion to the MMD platform (such as facial morphs, bones and physical bodies) is done with a program made exclusively for MMD model conversion, PMD Editor or its successor PMX editor. The software itself comes with a small number of models of well-known Vocaloids and an invisible grid, to which particle effects can be attached to in MME, a stage, some accessories, and two samples of what MMD can do, in the form of .pmm files; the file type that MMD projects are saved as. The software was originally only released in Japanese; however an English version was released at a later date. Videos using the software are regularly seen on sites such as Nico Nico Douga and YouTube and are popular among Vocaloid fans and users alike. A magazine which hands out exclusive models with every issue was also produced owing to this popularity. Some models for Vocaloid may also be used for Vocaloid music, going on to be used by studios working with the Vocaloid software. Many people also buy Windows 100% magazines which give models exclusive to the public. These come out once every month and due to popularity, model creators are giving out secret models, as well as the models people have paid for. Most of these tend to be Vocaloid or models that do not have a particular copyright holder. On May 26, 2011, continual updating of the software came to an end and the last version was released. In a closing statement, the creator left the software in the hands of the fans to continue building upon. Despite this, the source code has not been released, and the developer has no intentions of doing so, making it impossible for people to continue building upon the original software. However, there are alternative programs that provide similar functionality, such as MikuMikuMoving (MMD's \\"replacement\\" that is updated frequently and has many of the features of MMD, as well as new file formats unique to the program, support for the Oculus Rift head-mounted display and a new UI, among other features), and the free software, Blender. Between then and now, there have been several additions to MMD version 7.39, mainly the addition of the x64 version, which runs better than the normal version and is designed to use the power of 64-bit computers that 32-bit computers lack. This results in better performance, faster render times, and higher quality, to name a few. However, on June 1, 2013, MikuMikuDance's creator began to release updates for the program very suddenly. After he began releasing updates again, there have been 20 new versions and the 64-bit versions of them. Before June 1, the latest version was 7.39, which was released on May 26, 2011. MMD ver. 7.39 received several program updates between its initial release and the time of ver. 7.39m's release. Most of these updates were only made to increase compatibility with newer, more advanced .pmx models. It is unknown why the creator began editing the software again. On December 10, 2019, version 9.32 was released which is the most current version. In December 2014, Sekai Project announced that they had acquired permission to release MikuMikuDance on Steam. However, , it has not been released. The first anime television series to be fully produced with the software, Straight Title Robot Anime, premiered on February 5, 2013. Copyright The software was released as freeware. The models of the Vocaloid mascot series provided with the software are subject to the PiaPro Character License, and are not allowed to be used without permission for commercial reasons. Although the software is distributed freely, models released independently of the software may not be ‚Äî original produced models, motion data, and landscapes may be subject to their creator's own rules. The program does not include all of the Vocaloid characters by default, but it includes Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin, Kagamine Len, Kaito, Meiko, and Megurine Luka; and although Yowane Haku and Akita Neru are not official Vocaloids, they became so popular that Crypton officially licensed and added them to Project Diva.

The station was opened on August 10, 1984 and is currently the southwesternmost terminus of the Saltivska Line. It is located beneath the Maidan Konstytutsii, literally Constitution square in the historical part of Kharkiv, and is named for the historical museum which is located on the square. The station, inspired by the history of Kharkiv, has shaped columns and a relief-type ceiling in the station vestibule which give the feeling of the protected fort, which stood at this location during the 17th and 18th centuries. Also, the arrow-shaped arcs between the columns are reminiscent of fort gates. The columns are finished in a light colored marble Koelga and the tunnel walls are finished with brown marble and heraldic items made from bronze, which provide contrast. The Istorychniy Muzei station is located deep underground and is a pylon trivault and was designed by V.A. Spivachuk, P.G. Chechalnitskiy, and I.T. Karpenko; engineered by P.D. Pashkov, V.D. Shtuchkin, and L.P. Hryshyna; and was decorated by P.D. Chernova, V.E. Hutnik; I.I. Morgunov, O.Y. Erofeeva, V.V. Chursin, and V.D.Semenyuk. Station platform Istorychniy Muzei forms a complex with the adjacent Maidan Konstytutsii station on the Kholodnohirsko-Zavodska Line. Transfer tunnels from one station to another are located in the centre of the station. Also, four escalators lead into a spacious underground vestibule which is located under the Constitution Square. The vestibule is connected with the underground passenger tunnel which leads onto the square, to the Sums\`ka Street, the largest street in Kharkiv, to the Universytets\`ka Street, and to the Bursatskyi Descent. In 1985, during the finishing of the transfer tunnel from the Istorychniy Muzei to the Ploshcha Konstytutsii station, a closed-circuit television (CCTV) system was installed, the first in the Kharkiv Metro. Currently, all stations on the system have CCTV. The installation of this system allowed the workers of the metro to keep passengers in order and maintain more effective control over the escalators.

Her father, Mark Wenitong, is a medical practitioner. He became head of the Australian Indigenous Doctor's Association. Her mother, Deb Sisson, studied art. Both her parents were also in bands. Her paternal grandmother was one of the first indigenous health workers in Queensland. Wenitong was raised in Newcastle, New South Wales and at the age of sixteen she returned to Cairns to study music. Her older brother, Joel Wenitong, is also a musician and from 2002 to 2006 was a member of hip hop group Local Knowledge. They have two other siblings, including a brother, Micah. As from 2011 Micah was the Music NT Indigenous Music Officer in the Northern Territory where he \\"delivered song writing workshops and assisted with recording\\". In 1999 Wenitong attended TAFE North: Cairns campus, studying an ATSIC-sponsored music course. She formed a song writing partnership with fellow singer-songwriter, Simone Stacey, also studying the same course. Wenitong's first job was in a coffee shop. = 2001‚Äì06: Shakaya = In 2001 Wenitong and Stacey formed a pop girl duo, Shakaya. Not long after their inception the group were signed to Sony Music Entertainment. Shakaya's debut single \\"Stop Calling Me\\" was released in January 2002, it was co-written by Stacey, Wenitong and Reno Nicastro, their manager and producer. It was the duo's highest charting single, reaching No. 5 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The group's debut self-titled album, released 5 October 2002, peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Shakaya's success saw the group tour with Destiny's Child, Usher, Ja Rule, Ashanti and Shaggy as well as perform all backup vocals and raps for Peter Andre on his 2004 UK tour. Wenitong and Stacey returned from the United States where they had co-written and recorded Shakaya's second album, Are You Ready (March 2006). Wenitong had become disillusioned with the commercial major label and decided to change directions: so she disbanded the duo. Stacey took a hiatus from the music industry. = 2006 to present: The Last Kinection = The Last Kinection is a hip-hop group formed in Newcastle by Wenitong in 2006. As \\"Nay\\", she was joined by her older brother, Joel \\"Weno\\" Wenitong, and his former bandmate, Jacob \\"DJ Jaytee\\" Turier. Both Weno and DJ Jaytee had been members of Local Knowledge from 2002 to 2006. Wenitong told Shailla Van Raad of Bma magazine in July 2009, that \\"The Last Kinection has given me a great opportunity to explore my heritage and my own music\\", compared to singing songs written by others during her time with Shakaya. The group's two albums, Nutches (2008) and Next of Kin (2011), include tracks co- written by Wenitong. In September 2008, all three band members were involved in a car accident, with Wenitong receiving serious injuries. Wenitong sustained a broken femur, jaw, wrist, ribs, fractured pelvis, head injuries and was left in a coma. During her recovery Joel, who had driven the car, was distraught, their father Mark recalled \\"You feel that kind of ‚Äì especially as a big brother ‚Äì he really felt that sense of whether it was his fault or not. As he could see her improving, he was improving.\\" The accident was featured in an episode of the Crash Investigation Unit TV series. At the 2010 Deadly Awards, where she was the co-host with Luke Carroll, Wenitong won the category for Female Artist of the Year. From series 1 to 3, she went along with Brothablack to co-host Move it Mob Style. In April 2015 Wenitong, her father Mark and Stacey released cover versions of the songs, \\"Black Roses\\" by Inner Circle and \\"As Long As I Can See the Light\\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival for the community of Cairns affected by the child killings in December 2014.

In such cases, the community usually has unilineal descent, either patri- or matrilineal, so that any individual belongs to one of the two moiety groups by birth, and all marriages take place between members of opposite moieties. It is an exogamous clan system with only two clans. In the case of a patrilineal descent system, this can be interpreted as a system in which women are exchanged between the two moieties.

In 1903 she married Gustav Stresemann (1878‚Äì1929), who later became Chancellor and Foreign Minister of the Weimar Republic, and bore him two sons, Wolfgang (1904‚Äì1998) and Hans-Joachim (1908‚Äì1999). Her brother, Kurt von Kleefeld, was the last person in Germany to be ennobled, when he was raised to the hereditary nobility of the Principality of Lippe by Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe \\"in recognition of his loyal service\\" to his noble lord, Christian Kraft of Hohenlohe-Ohringen, Duke of Ujest, on request by the latter, on 12 November 1918, the same day as the Prince's abdication. Kleefeld is mentioned in one of the fictitious quotes the 8 November 1926 issue of Time satirically attributed to quite a number of prominent people under the headline: Had they been interviewed, some people who figured in last week's news might have related certain of their doings as follows: Gustav Stresemann, Foreign Minister of Germany: \\"A story went the rounds of Berlin last week that my ability to entertain lavishly on a salary of $6,400 a year is due to the kindly furtherance of my affairs by the multimillionaire Dr. von Kleefeld, my bachelor brother-in- law.\\"http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,729664-3,00.html In August 1929, when K√§te Stresemann hosted the program for spouses at the 25th World Advertising Congress in Berlin, Time described her as \\"no hausfrau, but a young, elegant, cosmopolite, English speaking Jewess, a woman equipped with the conversation of the polite world, equal to parlor or nightclub.\\" In the autumn of 1939 she fled Nazi Germany with her son Wolfgang and his family and settled in the United States, where her son Hans-Joachim had already found refuge. She lived in New York City until her death on a visit to Germany.

She was an obscure photographer who is most notably remembered for her documentation of the Northern Shoshone, Lemhi, and Bannock tribes in Idaho between 1895-1912. She is remembered above all for the many photographs she took of the Shoshone native people in Idaho. Early life Benedicte Wrensted was born in Hj√∏rring, Jutland. Her parents were Captain Carl V.

Online here She grew up and attended school in Frederikshavn in the far north of Jutland. One of the few professions considered suitable for women at the time was photography. Wrensted learnt the craft in the 1880s from her aunt, Charlotte Borgen, who was a photographer in Frederikshavn. She then opened a studio of her own in Horsens which she ran for a few years before emigrating to the United States with her mother in 1894.\\"Horsens billeder og postkort\\". Retrieved October 4, 2010. Years in America Portrait by Benedicte Wrensted of Pohene and Frank George, Lemhi Shoshone and Northern Shoshone (ca. 1897) After immigrating to the United States from Denmark, she first went to visit a cousin in Philadelphia, then went on to Pocatello, a small town in southeastern Idaho where her brother Peter lived. She operated a photography studio in 1895 where she took photographs of the local and regional inhabitants and recorded the growth of the town. From her studio, she produced telling portraits of Northern Shoshone and Bannock Indians from 1895 to 1912. She was known for her expressive handling of natural light and the painterly quality of her photographs. Wrensted photographed The Edmos, a prominent Native American family from the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, quite often. Wrensted became a U.S. citizen in 1912, at age 53, and the same year she ended her career as a photographer. She sold her studio in Pocatello and moved to Los Angeles where she died on January 19, 1949 shortly before her 90th birthday. Place in Anthropology left Many of her Native American images are preserved at the Smithsonian Institution and the National Archives. In the fall of 1984, Smithsonian anthropologist, Joanna Cohan Scherer was looking for photographs in the Smithsonian Institute's \\"Handbook of North American Indian\\" and came across the clutter of the Bannock County Historical Society in Pocatello, Idaho. She came across some Bannock County images that had the imprint \\"B. Wrensted, Pocatello.\\" After rediscovering these photographs and finding a collection of glass plate negatives in the National Archives labeled \\"Portraits of Indians from Southeastern Idaho Reservations, 1897\\".,\\"Benedicte Wrensted: An Idaho Photographer in Focus\\". Retrieved October 5, 2010.\\"Biography\\" . In connection with previous reference. Retrieved October 5, 2010. she was determined to find out more about Wrensted. She consulted tribal elders from the nearby Fort Hall Indian Reservation, wrote letters to people, checked business directories and looked through tons of museums and libraries in an effort to uncover the background of Wrensted and her photographs. The Idaho Museum of Natural History has a goal of demonstrating ways in which photographs can be placed within a historical context. Only 1% of Wrensted's images at the National Archives and Records Administration were identified at the onset of a digital library collection project. Once they were shown to the descendants at the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, information regarding families of origin were discovered and with the help of written records, 84% of Wrensted subjects have now been identified. Scherer encourages the reader to \\"go beyond consideration of Wrensted's portraits as art,\\" by advocating for the identification of the individual people portrayed in the photos as a means of avoiding stereotyping and the characterization of generic Indians as more \\"noble savages\\". \\"What sets Wrensted's work apart,\\" says Schere, \\"is her skill in portraying the humanity‚Äîthe individuality‚Äîof the people who posed for her. She captured their presence with a dignity and beauty that transcend time and place.\\" According to Scherer's estimates, today 170 of Wrensted's Shoshone Bannock images are known to exist in various collections, with a substantial number at the Idaho Museum of Natural History. Wrensted's photographs of her Indian subjects were not left with the people of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, but were, as Scherer tells us, \\"uprooted from their place of origin and put into impersonal hands‚Äînamely, the National Archives in Washington, D.C.\\" See also *Photography in Denmark References External links * Benedicte Wrensted: An Idaho Photographer in Focus * Out of the Shadows (video), Idaho Experience 07/18/2019.

It is an intermittent water course that reaches the ocean through an estuary.Biological responses to a resumption in river flow in a freshwater- deprived, permanently open Southern African estuary This river rises 24 km west of Grahamstown and gives its name to Kariega Park.  Origin of the name  The Steenbok or Kariega antelope On the strength of other three Kariega rivers being possibly 'Steenbok' rivers it is generally assumed that the same applies here. However, this is not necessarily the case, for there is no record of Steenbok being found anywhere along the length of the river. It is true that cave-paintings said to depict these animals are to be found in the vicinity, but there are numerous instances of animals being depicted in caves situated in habitat entirely unsuited to them. (And in the Swartberg there is a painting of a full-rigged sailing ship, despite the cave being situated more than 100 km from the sea.) The original inhabitants of much of the Cape were the Khoikhoi. Their descendants are still in the area, but other than in parts of the Northern Cape their languages are no longer spoken. Nonetheless there are still plenty of Khoikhoi words in everyday use in this country. In the Cape Khoikhoi words are most often encountered in the form of place names, examples being Knysna ‚Äì meaning 'ferns' - a town on the Garden Route, and the Cango Caves ‚Äì Cango being the Khoikhoi for 'wet mountain'. And, of course, there is Kariega Park, situated beside the Kariega River. It is uncertain why this particular Kariega River acquired its name, or what it means, but although one will not see a Steenbok occurring naturally in the area of the Kariega Park, the name is typical of the Cape, has connections with the earliest people to inhabit the area, and is the name of one of its most charming and graceful small buck. Other Kariega Rivers  There are another three Kariega Rivers in the Eastern Cape. =The Kariega and the Beervlei Dam = A Kariega River flows into the Beervlei Dam which is situated north of Willowmore. The name of this river has appeared in a variety of forms, including Karuiga and Karuka and this has led the experts to believe that in this case the Kariega should in fact be one of these earlier forms and that it refers to 'buffalo'. After all the earliest European settlers in the area referred to the river as the Buffels - Buffalo. However, various sources, basing their argument not on linguistics, but on the incidence of the antelope in the vicinity, have stated that the name means 'Steenbok'. = The Kariega and the Sundays River = Then there is the Kariega River that is a tributary of the Sundays River.Catchment N40 - The Sundays River For much of its length it flows through an area known as the Steenbok Flats, and on which there is a farm named Kariega. Steenbok were frequently found in this area, and are not unknown today. For this reason, and on the strength of linguistics, the experts believe that in this case Kariega does mean Steenbok. = The Kariega and the Great Fish River = The Great Fish River also has as one of its tributaries a Kariega River, the source of which is in the mountains some 20 km north of Somerset East. There are no historical records of Steenbok in this area, but the river flows through countryside that is typical of that favoured by this small buck, so there is no reason to doubt that in this instance Kariega also stands for 'Steenbok'.

Imperial Japanese Army troops landed on 7 June 1942 the day after the invasion of Kiska. Along with the Kiska landing, it was the first time that the continental United States was invaded and occupied by a foreign power since the War of 1812, and was the second of the only two invasions of the United States during World War II. The occupation ended with the Allied victory in the Battle of Attu on 30 May 1943. Occupation In May 1942, the Japanese began near-simultaneous campaigns against Midway, and the Aleutians, thus beginning the Aleutian Islands Campaign. During the Battle of Midway, Japanese forces were repulsed in a decisive action, meanwhile, on 7 June, Japanese naval forces under Boshir≈ç Hosogaya landed troops unopposed at Attu in conjunction with the same forces invading Kiska the previous day. A force consisting of 1,140 infantry under Major Matsutoshi Hosumi took control of the island and captured Attu's population, which consisted of 45 Aleuts and two white Americans, Charles Foster Jones (1879-1942), an amateur radio operator and weather reporter, originally from St. Paris, Ohio, and his wife Etta (1879-1965), a teacher and nurse, originally from Vineland, New Jersey.Mary Breu (2009) Last Letters from Attu, Alaska Northwest Books, The village consisted of several houses around Chichagof Harbor on the northeast side of the island. The 42 Aleut inhabitants who survived the Japanese invasion were taken to a prison camp near Otaru, Hokkaido. Sixteen of them died while they were imprisoned. Charles Jones was killed by the Japanese forces immediately after the invasion due to his refusal to fix the radio he previously destroyed to prevent the occupying troops from using it. His wife was subsequently taken to the Bund Hotel in Yokohama, Japan, which housed Australian Rabaul New Britain nurses who had been taken prisoner during the capture of Rabaul in 1942. They were later transferred to the Yokohama Yacht Club and kept there from 1942 to July 1944 when then moved to the old Totsuka Hospital, also in Yokohama. The hospital served as a civilian prisoner of war camp until the end of the war in August 1945. Etta Jones died in December 1965 at age 86 in Bradenton, Florida.Mary Breu (2009) Last Letters from Attu, Alaska Northwest Books, Attu village, occupied by the Japanese and retaken during the Battle of Attu. After landing, the soldiers began constructing an airbase and fortifications. The nearest American forces were on Unalaska Island at Dutch Harbor and at an airbase on Adak Island. Throughout the occupation, American air and naval forces bombarded the island. Initially the Japanese intended to hold the Aleutians only until the winter of 1942; however, the occupation continued into 1943 in order to deny the Americans use of the islands. In August 1942, the garrison of Attu was moved to Kiska to help repel a suspected American attack. From August to October 1942, Attu was unoccupied until a 2,900-man force under Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki arrived. The new garrison of Attu continued constructing the airfield and fortifications until 11 May 1943, when a 15,000 man army of American troops landed. On 12 May, was forced to surface five miles northeast of Chichagof Harbor, she was then sunk in a surface engagement with . Chichagof Harbor under attack during the Allied liberation of Attu. Allied forces under General John L. DeWitt took control of the island on 30 May after the remaining Japanese troops conducted a massive banzai charge. American forces lost 549 killed and 1,148 wounded, another 2,100 evacuated due to weather-related injuries. During the Battle of Attu, all but 29 men of the Japanese garrison were killed. The occupation ended with an American victory and American forces deemed the half-completed airfield as not ideally situated. After building a new airfield the Americans launched bomber attacks against the Japanese home islands for the remainder of the war Brian Garfield, The Thousand-Mile War: World War II in Alaska and the Aleutians Attu village was abandoned after the war, and surviving members of Japanese internment were moved to other islands after the war. In 2012, for the 70th anniversary of the occupation, a memorial to Attu village was dedicated at the former site of the town.

Rockets are used primarily as medium and long-range artillery systems, although historically they have also seen considerable use as air-to-surface, some use as air-to-air weapons, and even a few examples of surface-to-air devices. Examples of modern surface-to-surface rocket systems include the BM-27 Uragan and M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System. In military parlance, a rocket differs from a missile primarily by lacking an active guidance system; early missiles were known as \\"guided rockets\\" or \\"guided missiles\\". Some rockets were developed as unguided systems and later upgraded to guided versions, like the GMLRS, and these generally retain the term \\"rocket\\" instead of becoming missiles. Rockets or missiles that travel underwater, like the VA-111 Shkval, are known as torpedoes no matter what their propulsion system is.  Early development  The use of rockets as some form of artillery dates back to medieval China where devices such as fire arrows were used (albeit mostly as a psychological weapon), and gradually spread to Europe and the Middle East. Rockets became a significant weapon during the 20th century, when precise manufacturing processes made relatively accurate rockets possible.  Basic roles  = Artillery = M270 MLRS Rockets have been used as an artillery weapon for centuries, and continue to be used in the modern age after being extensively modernized in World War II. Rockets in the artillery role complement traditional field guns, being superior in some ways and inferior in others. Rocket artillery tends to be simpler, lighter and more mobile than guns or howitzers, most of which must be emplaced. Guns tend to have better accuracy, consistency, and range, while rocket artillery is light enough to be employed closer to the front lines and excels at saturation fire, expending its entire ammunition load in a single barrage on a target. The saturation fire produced by rocket artillery is only somewhat approximated in effectiveness with gun artillery via the time on target barrage method. Time- sensitive soft target interdiction (such as personnel or unarmored vehicles moving in large groups) is where rocket artillery is particularly useful. This allows for the shoot-and-scoot method, avoiding the enemy counter-battery fire that is the greatest risk to emplaced artillery pieces, while maximizing damage to the target before it can find better cover. (see Rocket artillery vs gun artillery) German Army Panzerfaust 3. = Portable rockets = With the invention of the tank, the infantry required a weapon to counter the threat. Tank armour soon developed beyond the point at which an anti-tank rifle could practically be carried by an infantryman, and by the Second World War rocket weapons such as the US bazooka and German Panzerschreck were in service. Development continued after the war, with weapons such as the RPG-7, although a need to increase range led to the development of guided weapons to fulfill the anti-tank role. Most modern armies now use guided missiles for long-range engagements and rockets for close-range or emergency use; disposable weapons such as the RPG-26 are popular for this. The use of anti-tank weapons to attack buildings and other targets has led to the development of weapons and ammunition designed specifically to attack non-tank targets, such as the one- shot LASM and the larger SMAW. = Air-launched = AH-64 carrying rocket pods Unguided rockets are a widely used weapon system and have been launched from aircraft since the early 20th century, to attack land, sea and air targets. Even after the development of guided missiles, rockets remain useful for short-range attacks ‚Äì typically for close air support missions.  70mm (2.75\\")  The standard NATO calibre is 70mm and is meanwhile considered as the international calibre. The rockets can be fired from a variety of rotary and fixed-wing platforms and combat aircraft of many nations worldwide by means of a rocket launcher. The 70mm rocket system offers several warhead configurations that fulfill a wide range of special mission requirements to defeat soft to lightly armored targets.

Early life and career As his surname indicates, Ali was born in √áorlu in , the son of a peasant or barber. His handsome appearance and intelligence led to his adoption by a member of the court under Sultan Ahmed II (). This opened the way to the Galata Palace School, and eventually the Inner Service of the palace itself. Ali rose quickly, from seferli oda to the post of Silahdar Agha (chief sword-bearer) under Mustafa II (). As Silahdar Agha, √áorlulu Ali advanced his office's standing and power considerably: from the Kizlar Agha he assumed the role of intermediary between the Grand Vizier and the Sultan, and from the Kapi Agha he took over control of the palace pages, the i√ß oƒülans. Ali was also charged with reordering the hierarchy of the entire Inner Service. At the beginning of the revolt known as the Edirne event in 1703, he was dismissed due to the intrigues of the Grand Vizier Rami Mehmed Pasha and the influential Sheikh-ul- Islam, Hacƒ± Feyzullah Efendi, although he acquired the rank of vizier. However, after Mustafa II's overthrow, Sultan Ahmed III () appointed √áorlulu Ali as a \\"vizier of the dome\\" (kubbe vezir, i.e., a member of the Imperial Council). He was briefly appointed as the beylerbey (governor-general) of Tripoli (modern Lebanon) in 1704, but quickly returned to Istanbul and resumed his position as \\"vizier of the dome\\". Grand vizierate In May 1706, he was appointed as Grand Vizier. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, he was \\"the first competent Grand Vizier of the reign\\", and enjoyed high favour with the Sultan, who in 1708 married his niece Emine Sultan (a daughter of Mustafa II) to him. Thus Ali gained the title damat (\\"groom\\") to the Ottoman dynasty. As Grand Vizier, √áorlulu Ali paid particular attention to rectifying the abuses in the Ottoman army, the reining in of the government budget, and improvements to the Ottoman navy and the Imperial Arsenal. At the same time, however, he was strongly opposed to entering any conflict for the time being. Thus he was accused of missing the opportunities presented by the War of the Spanish Succession, which drew the attention of the Western European powers, to regain the Morea from the Republic of Venice, as well as checking the growing threat of Peter the Great during Charles XII of Sweden's invasion of Russia in the Great Northern War. Indeed, after his defeat at the Battle of Poltava, Charles XII refused to treat with √áorlulu Ali, as he believed that he had been promised assistance from the Crimean Khanate, an Ottoman vassal, that had never materialized. Matters came to a head when Charles XII sought refuge in Ottoman lands. Peter the Great tried to follow him into Ottoman lands, and Charles persuaded the Ottoman government to declare war on Russia.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt III, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 p 23 Ali Pasha wasn't able to follow a consistent policy, and the Swedish ambassador accused him of accepting bribes from the Russians. Having lost the Sultan's confidence, Ali was dismissed in June 1710 and sent to govern Kefe (Feodosia) in the Crimea. But before he was able to reach his new office, the sultan changed his mind and exiled Ali Pasha to the island of Lesbos (in modern Greece), where he was then executed in December 1711. Buildings √áorlulu Ali ereted a number of monuments, including a school and a fountain at √áorlu, and two Friday mosques in Istanbul: at the Imperial Arsenal, and at the quarter, where his tomb is.

La Tinen√ßa de Benifass√† was documented as a comarca in the map Comarques naturals del Regne de Val√®ncia made by Emili Be√ºt in 1934. Most of the villages in the historical comarca have become very depopulated in recent decades owing to the abandonment of traditional agricultural practices by the local youth and the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century. The Generalitat Valenciana administration declared the whole area of the historical comarca a Natural Park under the name Parc Natural de la Tinen√ßa de Benifass√† in May 2006.

The screenplay (by Willard Carroll) concerns a boy who discovers a secret garden. The film was based on the novel Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce, and filmed at Chenies Manor House in Buckinghamshire. The film was produced by Hyperion Pictures. Premise After going to stay with his uncle a boy is disappointed that he doesn't have a garden he can play in. However, he discovers a secret garden that only appears in the middle of the night. Plot When Tom Long's brother Peter gets measles he is sent to stay with his Uncle Alan and Aunt Gwen in a flat with no garden. An elderly and reclusive landlady, Mrs Bartholomew, lives upstairs. Because he may be infectious he is not allowed out to play, and feels lonely. Without exercise he is less sleepy at night and when he hears the communal grandfather clock strangely strike 13, he investigates and finds the small back yard is now a large sunlit garden. Here he meets another lonely child called Hatty, who seems to be the only one who can see him. They have adventures which he gradually realises are taking place in the 19th century. Each night when Tom visits, Hatty is slightly older and Tom begins to wonder about the nature of time and reality. In an attempt to discover what's going on Tom asks Hattie to leave her skates in a hidden place. When he goes back into the future he manages to find them. One night Hatty and Tom go out skating however Hatty begins to fall in love with a boy from her own time named Barty and Tom finds he is invisible to her. The next night Tom is unable to find the garden, running into rubbish bins from the modern day instead. Just before Tom returns home he meets Mrs Bartholomew, who is revealed to be the elderly Hatty.

These responsibilities included the maintenance, storage, surveillance, security and handling of nuclear weapons, as well as supporting nuclear testing. The AFSWP was a joint organization, staffed by the United States Army, United States Navy and United States Air Force; its chief was supported by deputies from the other two services. Major General Leslie R. Groves, the former head of the Manhattan Project, was its first chief. The early nuclear weapons were large, complex and cumbersome. They were stored as components rather than complete devices and required expert knowledge to assemble. The short life of their lead-acid batteries and modulated neutron initiators, and the heat generated by the fissile cores, precluded storing them assembled. The large quantity of conventional explosive in each weapon demanded special care be taken in handling. Groves hand-picked a team of regular Army officers, who were trained in the assembly and handling of the weapons. They in turn trained the enlisted soldiers, and the Army teams then trained teams from the Navy and Air Force. As nuclear weapons development proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, and easier to store, handle and maintain. They also required less effort to assemble. The AFSWP gradually shifted its emphasis away from training assembly teams, and became more involved in stockpile management and providing administrative, technical and logistical support. It supported nuclear weapons testing, although after Operation Sandstone in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), a field agency of the Department of Defense. Origins Nuclear weapons were developed during World War II by the Manhattan Project, a major research and development effort led by the United States, with participation from the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, it was under the direction of Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., of the US Army Corps of Engineers. It created a network of production facilities, most notably for uranium enrichment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, plutonium production at Hanford, Washington and weapons research and design at the Los Alamos Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The nuclear weapons that were developed were used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. After the war ended, the Manhattan Project supported the nuclear weapons testing at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads in 1946. One of Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal's aides, Lewis Strauss proposed this series of tests to refute \\"loose talk to the effect that the fleet is obsolete in the face of this new weapon.\\" The nuclear weapons were handmade devices, and a great deal of work remained to improve their ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production. There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended, but that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development. Groves's biggest concern was about people. Soldiers and scientists wanted to return to their peacetime pursuits, and there was a danger that wartime knowledge would be lost, leaving no one who knew how to handle and maintain nuclear weapons, much less how to improve the weapons and processes. The military side of the Manhattan Project had relied heavily on reservists, as the policy of the Corps of Engineers was to assign regular officers to field commands. The reservists were now eligible for separation. To replace them, Groves asked for fifty West Point graduates from the top ten percent of their classes to man bomb assembly teams at Sandia Base, where the assembly staff and facilities had been moved from Los Alamos and Wendover Field in September and October 1945. He felt that only such high quality personnel would be able to work with the scientists who were currently doing the job. They were also urgently required for many other jobs in the postwar Army. When General Thomas T. Handy turned down his request, Groves raised the matter with the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, who similarly did not approve it. Groves then went over his head too, and took it to the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, who agreed with Groves. The personnel manned the 2761st Engineer Battalion (Special), which became a field unit under the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Groves hoped that a new, permanent agency would be created to take over the responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project in 1945, but passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the Manhattan Project $72.4 million for research and development, and $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge. The Atomic Energy Act provided for a Military Liaison Committee to advise the AEC on military matters, so Patterson appointed Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton, who became chairman, along with Major General Lunsford E. Oliver and Colonel John H. Hinds as Army members of the Military Liaison Committee; Forrestal appointed Rear Admirals Thorvald A. Solberg, Ralph A. Ofstie and William S. Parsons as its naval members. Organization File:Leslie_Groves.jpg|alt=Head and shoulders of a man in uniform|Major General Leslie R.

Parker (1957‚Äì1959) Patterson asked Groves to create a new agency to take over responsibility for the aspects of nuclear weapons that still remained under the military. It was to be jointly staffed by the Army and Navy, and on 29 January 1947, Patterson and Forrestal issued a memorandum that formally established the AFSWP. Its chief would be appointed jointly by the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations, along with a deputy from the opposite service. Both would be members of the Military Liaison Committee, because the Atomic Energy Act stipulated that the Military Liaison Committee was the sole military body that dealt with the AEC. In February 1947, Eisenhower and Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz appointed Groves as head of the AFSWP, with Parsons as his deputy. Accordingly, Groves was appointed to the Military Liaison Committee, although the newly appointed AEC chairman, David E. Lilienthal, told Patterson that he did not think that it was a good idea, because Groves had run the Manhattan Project by himself for four years, and was not used to having to compromise. Groves and Parsons drafted a proposed organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to Eisenhower and Nimitz for approval in July 1947. Groves did not get everything that he asked for; he wanted a status equal to that of a deputy to the Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations, but the most that Eisenhower and Nimitz would allow was a status equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although Groves still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, Groves reported to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, who had worked on the Silverplate project during the war. Groves initially established the headquarters of the AFSWP in the old offices of the Manhattan Project on the fifth floor of the New War Department Building in Washington, DC, but on 15 April 1947 it moved to the Pentagon. As AFSWP headquarters expanded, it filled up its original accommodation, and began using office space in other parts of the building, which was not satisfactory from a security point of view. In August 1949, it moved to of new offices inside the Pentagon. This included space for a soundproof conference room, a darkroom, and vaults where its records and films were stored. A nuclear capable alt=Large black twin-propeller aircraft on the deck of an aircraft carrier. The island is in the background and other aircraft are parked astern. Various crewmen are standing around, wearing brightly colored jerseys. The 2761st Engineer Battalion (Special) at Sandia was commanded by Colonel Gilbert M. Dorland, and consisted of a headquarters company, a security company (Company A), a bomb assembly company (Company B) and a radiological monitoring company (Company C), although Company C was never fully formed. For training purposes, Company B was initially divided into command, electrical, mechanical and nuclear groups, but the intention was to create three integrated 36-man bomb assembly teams. To free the bomb assembly teams from having to train newcomers, a Technical Training Group (TTG) was created under Lieutenant Colonel John A. Ord, a Signal Corps officer with a Doctor of Science degree from Carnegie Institute of Technology who had directed the training of thousands of radar technicians at the Southern Signal Corps School during the war. The battalion was redesignated the 38th Engineer Battalion (Special) in April 1947, and in July it became part of the newly created AFSWP Field Command, under the command of Brigadier General Robert M. Montague. The TTG was soon reporting directly to Montague as well. The first bomb assembly team was formed in August 1947, followed by a second in December and a third in March 1948. Experience with assembling the bombs convincingly demonstrated the requirement, in Sandia if not in Washington, for a much larger unit. Groves reluctantly approved a 109-man special weapons unit, and Montague converted the three lettered companies of the 38th Engineer Battalion into special weapons units. In 1948, they began training a Navy special weapons unit, as the Navy foresaw delivery of nuclear weapons with its new North American AJ Savage bombers from its s. This unit became the 471st Naval Special Weapons Unit on its certification in August 1948. Two Air Force units were created in September and December 1948, which became the 502d and 508th Aviation Squadrons. An additional Army special weapons unit was created in May 1948, and in December, the 38th Engineer Battalion (Special) became the 8460th Special Weapons Group, with all seven special weapons units under its command. The four Army units were then renamed the 111th, 122d, 133d and 144th Special Weapons Units. During the late 1940s the Air Force gradually became the major user of nuclear weapons, and by the end of 1949, it had twelve assembly units, and another three in training, while the Army had only four, and the Navy three, one for each of the three Midway-class carriers. In March 1948, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Carl Spaatz, proposed that the Air Force take over the AFSWP, on the grounds that the Key West Agreement had given it responsibility for strategic bombing. This would have simplified command of the AFSWP, as it would have been answerable to only one service chief instead of three. The Army cautiously supported the proposal, but the Navy was strongly opposed, fearing that the Air Force's confusion of atomic bombing and strategic bombing would impede or even prevent the Navy from having access to nuclear weapons, which it felt was necessary to accomplish its primary maritime mission. Another series of talks was held at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, from 20 to 22 August 1948, which resulted in the Newport Agreement, under which the Navy agreed to drop its opposition to the AFSWP being placed under the Air Force temporarily, in return for the Air Force recognizing the Navy's requirement for nuclear weapons. When the Air Force moved to make the temporary arrangement permanent in September 1948, the Army and Navy objected, and the Military Liaison Committee directed that the AFSWP should remain a tri-service organization answerable to the three service chiefs. Field operations Groves and the wartime director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Robert Oppenheimer, had begun the move of ordnance functions to Sandia in late 1945. The laboratory's ordnance engineering division, known as Z Division, after its first director, Jerrold R. Zacharias, was split between Los Alamos and Sandia. Between March and July 1946, Z Division relocated to Sandia, except for its mechanical engineering (Z-4) section, which followed in February 1947. Z Division worked on improving the mechanical and electrical reliability of the Mark 3 Fat Man bomb, but this work was disrupted by the Crossroads tests. {border=\\"0\\" alt=Cut away diagram of a bomb ; Mark 3 Fat Man external components # AN 219 contact fuze (four) # Archie radar antenna # Plate with batteries (to detonate charge surrounding nuclear components) # X-Unit, a firing set placed near the charge # Hinge fixing the two ellipsoidal parts of the bomb # Physics package (see details below) # Plate with instruments (radars, baroswitches and timers) # Barotube collector # California Parachute tail assembly ( aluminium sheet) |} The 1947 nuclear stockpile consisted of nuclear weapons components, not weapons. Meeting with Truman in April 1947, Lilienthal informed him that not only were there no assembled weapons, but there were only a few sets of components, and no fully trained bomb assembly teams. By August 1946, Sandia Base held electrical and mechanical assemblies for about 50 Fat Man bombs, but there were only nine fissile cores in storage. The stockpile of cores grew to 13 in 1947, and 53 in 1948. Oppenheimer noted that the bombs were \\"still largely the haywire contraptions that were slapped together in 1945.\\" With a half-life of only 140 days, the polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiators had to be periodically removed from the plutonium pits, tested, and, if necessary, replaced. The cores had to be stored separately from the high explosive blocks that would surround them in the bomb because they generated enough heat to melt the plastic explosive over time. The heat could also affect the cores themselves, provoking a phase transition to a different allotrope of plutonium. They had to be periodically inspected by technicians wearing gloves and respirators. The bomb's electrical power for its radar fuzes and detonators came from a pair of lead-acid batteries similar to those used in cars. These had to be charged 24 hours before use. After a few days, the bomb had to be partially disassembled so that they could be re-charged; and three days after that the batteries had to be replaced. alt=Another cut away diagram of a bomb, this time detailing the lenses and the pit. The 38th Engineer Battalion's electrical group studied the batteries, the electrical firing systems and the radar fuzes which detonated the bomb at the required altitude. The mechanical group dealt with the exploding-bridgewire detonators and the explosive lenses. The nuclear group moved to Los Alamos to study the cores and initiators. As part of their training, they attended lectures by Edward Teller, Hans Bethe, Lise Meitner and Enrico Fermi. The electrical and mechanical groups at Sandia, although not the nuclear group, completed their training around the end of October 1946 and spent the next month devising the best methods of assembling a Fat Man, drawing up detailed checklists so that later bomb assembly teams could be trained. They also drew up a proposed table of organization and equipment for an assembly team. It took two weeks for them to assemble their first bomb in December 1946. Most of 1947 was spent planning for a field exercise in which a bomb team would deploy to a base and assemble weapons under field conditions. A by portable building was acquired and outfitted as field workshops that could be loaded onto a C-54 or C-97 transport aircraft. In November 1947, the 38th Engineer Battalion carried out its first major field exercise, Operation Ajax. It drew bomb components, except for fissile cores, from the AEC, and deployed by air to Wendover Field, Utah. This was the home of the 509th Bombardment Group, which was the only unit operating Silverplate B-29 bombers, and therefore the only B-29 group capable of delivering nuclear weapons. To simulate operational conditions, they took a roundabout route via New England and Seattle. Over the following ten days, they assembled bombs and flew training missions with them, including a live drop at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California. This was followed by other exercises. In one exercise in March 1948, the base personnel successfully fought off an \\"attack\\" by 250 paratroopers from Fort Hood, Texas. In another exercise in November 1948, the 471st Special Weapons Unit flew to Norfolk, Virginia, and practiced bomb assembly on board the Midway-class aircraft carriers. Nuclear testing An alt=An artillery piece with a mushroom cloud rising in the distance In addition to assembly of weapons, the AFSWP supported nuclear weapons testing. For Operation Sandstone in 1948, Groves ordered Dorland to fill every possible job with his men. He did this so well that Strauss, now an AEC commissioner, became disturbed at the number of AFSWP personnel who were participating, and feared that the Soviet Union might launch a sneak attack on Enewetak to wipe out the nation's ability to assemble nuclear weapons. The successful testing in Operation Sandstone was a major leap forward. The new Mark 4 nuclear bomb that the AEC began delivering in 1949 was a production design that was much easier to assemble and maintain, and enabled a bomb assembly team to be reduced to just 46 men. Kenneth D. Nichols, the wartime commander of the Manhattan District, now \\"recommended that we should be thinking in terms of thousands of weapons rather than hundreds.\\" After Operation Sandstone, only relatively small numbers of AFSWP personnel were involved in nuclear testing. The AFSWP was heavily involved in the planning, preparation and coordination of tests, but it had limited participation in the tests themselves, where the bomb assembly function was usually undertaken by scientists. During Operation Buster-Jangle, AFSWP personnel showed films and gave lectures to 2,800 military personnel who had been selected to witness the test, explaining what would occur and the procedures to be followed. This was expanded to cater for the more than 7,000 personnel who were involved in Operation Upshot‚ÄìKnothole in 1953. Custody of nuclear weapons When the AEC was formed in 1947 it acquired custody of nuclear components from the Manhattan Project on the understanding that the matter would be reviewed. In November 1947, the Military Liaison Committee requested that custody of the nuclear stockpile be transferred to the military, but Lilienthal believed that AEC custody of the stockpile was an important aspect of civilian control of nuclear weapons. He was disturbed that the AFSWP had not informed the AEC in advance of Operation Ajax. For his part, Groves suspected that the AEC was not keeping bomb components in the condition in which the military wanted to receive them, and Operation Ajax only confirmed his suspicions. Reviewing the exercise, Montague reported that \\"under the existing law, with the AEC charged with procurement and custody of all atomic weapons, there was no adequate logistic support for the weapon.\\" He recommended a larger role for the military, a recommendation with which Groves concurred, but was powerless to implement. alt=An orange and gold certificate with a mushroom cloud on it. Writing identifies the class, and it is signed by Lieutenant General Louis E. Heath. Groves retired at the end of February 1948, and Nichols was designated as his successor with the rank of major general. At the same time, Forrestal, now the Secretary of Defense, reorganized the Military Liaison Committee. A civilian, Donald F. Carpenter, replaced Brereton as chairman, and there were now two members from each of the three services. On 11 March, Truman summoned Lilienthal, Nichols and Secretary of the Army Kenneth C. Royall to his office, and told them that he expected the AFSWP and the AEC to cooperate. Nichols's position was the same as Groves's and Montague's: that nuclear weapons needed to be available in an emergency, and the men who had to use them in battle needed to have experience with their maintenance, storage and handling. Norris Bradbury, who had replaced Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in December 1945, argued that rapid transfer could be accomplished by improved procedures and that the other difficulties could best be resolved by further development, mostly from the scientists. Forrestal and Carpenter took the matter up with Truman, who issued his decision on 21 July 1948: \\"I regard the continued control of all aspects of the atomic energy program, including research, development and the custody of atomic weapons as the proper functions of the civil authorities.\\" With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, air transport resources were put under great strain, and it was decided to reduce the requirement for it by pre-positioning non-nuclear components at locations in Europe and the Pacific. That way, in an emergency, only the nuclear components would have to be flown out. In June, Truman ordered the transfer of 90 sets of non-nuclear Mark4 components to the AFSWP for training purposes. In December, he authorized the carriage of non-nuclear components on board the Midway-class carriers. In April 1951, the AEC released nine Mark4 weapons to the Air Force in case the Soviet Union intervened in the war in Korea. These were flown to Guam, where they were maintained by the Air Force special weapons unit there. Thus, at the end of 1951, there were 429 weapons in AEC custody and nine held by the Department of Defense. In the light of this, a new AEC-AFSWP agreement on \\"Responsibilities of Stockpile Operations\\" was drawn up in August 1951, but in December, the Joint Chiefs of Staff began a new push for weapons to be permanently assigned to the armed forces, so as to ensure a greater degree of flexibility and a higher state of readiness. On 20 June 1953, Eisenhower, now as president, approved the deployment of nuclear components in equal numbers to non-nuclear components, and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 amended the sections of the old act that gave exclusive custody to the AEC. By 1959, the nuclear stockpile had grown to 12,305 weapons of which 3,968 were in AEC custody and the remaining 8,337 were held by the Department of Defense. The total yield of the stockpile was now in excess of . As Bradbury had promised, with research and development, nuclear weapons became smaller, simpler and lighter. They also became easier to store, assemble, test and maintain. Thus, while under Eisenhower's New Look policy the Armed Forces became more heavily involved with aspects of nuclear weapons than ever, the role of the AFSWP diminished. It began moving away from training assembly teams, which were increasingly not required, as its primary mission, and became more involved in the management of the rapidly growing nuclear stockpile, and providing technical advice and logistical support. In 1953, the AFSWP Field Command had 10,250 personnel. On 16 October 1953, the Secretary of Defense charged the AFSWP with responsibility for \\"a centralized system of reporting and accounting to ensure that the current status and location\\" of all nuclear weapons \\"will be known at all times\\". The Atomic Warfare Status Center was created within the AFSWP to handle this mission. Conversion to Defense Atomic Support Agency In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for legislation to overhaul the Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and he was concerned about the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500 million. The Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 was signed by Eisenhower in August 1958. It increased the authority of the Secretary of Defense, who was authorized to establish such defense agencies as he thought necessary \\"to provide for more effective, efficient and economical administration and operation\\". The first field agency established under the act was the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), which replaced the AFSWP on 1 May 1959. The new agency reported to the Secretary of Defense through the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was given responsibility for the supervision of all Department of Defense nuclear testing, which had hitherto been handled by the individual services. Otherwise, its role and organization remained much the same, and its commander, Rear Admiral Edward N. Parker, remained as its first director. Eisenhower's proposed nuclear testing moratorium ultimately fundamentally changed DASA's mission, as nuclear testing was phased out, Cold War tensions eased, and nuclear disarmament became a prospect.

Downloaded on 08 June 2016. The species was named for the Etowah River of Georgia. Biology and ecology This species lives in clear water on rocky and gravelly substrates in riffles, creeks, and streams. It feeds on bottomdwelling life by rummaging through rocks with its bony head, long snout, and sucker mouth. A diet analysis showed that 90.6% of the contents in their stomachs were Diptera, with Chironomidae larvae making up 88.8% of all food items. This species likely has a lifespan of over 5 years. Sexual maturity is attained around three years of age or at a length around 110 millimeters. It grows in size and weight most rapidly in spring due to increased feeding spurred by the impending spawning season. It spawns over gravel in pools and riffles. Typically when spawning, one female is flanked on each side by two males. Once eggs are released and fertilized there is no parental care invested and they hatch after ten days. Conservation and management This species is not considered to be threatened or endangered. It has a limited range but the population is relatively large and stable and divided into many subpopulations. There are no major threats. It is considered to be a common fish in its range.

He was soon seen at that theatre as Belcore in Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, Enrico in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, Germont in Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata, Lionel in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Maid of Orleans, Valentin in Charles Gounod's Faust and the title role in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. In 1998 Luƒçiƒá joined the roster of principal artists at the Frankfurt Opera where he remained committed through 2008. There he sang a broad repertoire, but drew particular acclaim as a Verdi baritone. Some of the Verdi roles which he has sung in Frankfurt are Amonasro in Aida, the Count di Luna in Il trovatore, Ezio in Attila, Germont, Guy de Montfort in Les v√™pres siciliennes, and Renato in Un ballo in maschera. Other roles which he has sung with that opera company are The Duke of Nottingham in Donizetti's Roberto Devereux, Count Almaviva in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, Eugene Onegin, Lescaut in Giacomo Puccini's Manon Lescaut, Marcello in Puccini's La boh√®me, Michonnet in Francesco Cilea's Adriana Lecouvreur, Prince Ivan- Korolevich in Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Kashchey the Deathless, Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, and Simone in Mozart's La finta semplice among others. Luƒçiƒá has also appeared as a guest artist with numerous major opera houses internationally. He made his debut at the De Nederlandse Opera in 2002 in the roles of Guy de Montfort and Marcello. He sang Germont for his first appearance at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 2003 and that same year sang the Count di Luna for his debut at the Teatro Comunale Florence. In 2006 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Barnaba in Amilcare Ponchielli's La Gioconda with Violeta Urmana in the title role and Bertrand de Billy conducting. He has since returned to that house as Verdi's Germont, Michele in Puccini's Il tabarro, and in the title roles of Verdi's Macbeth and Verdi's Rigoletto. He was scheduled to return to the Met for the 2010-11 season as Rigoletto and the Count di Luna. In October 2015, he performed as Iago in Verdi‚Äôs Otello at the Metand more recently as Scarpia in Tosca. At the Vienna State Opera he sang Giorgio Germont, Simon Boccanegra, Don Carlo in La forza del destino, Nabucco and Scarpia. He replaced Pl√°cido Domingo in the 2019 Metropolitan Opera production of Macbeth after accusations of sexual harassment.

Early life Graham was born in Sandakan, North Borneo (now Sabah) on 3 January 1941 to Scottish parents. Just over a year later, on 19 January 1942, the Japanese landed at Sandakan as part of the invasion of Borneo that had commenced on 16 December 1941 when the Japanese took Miri and Seria in Sarawak. For the first few months the European civilians were interned in various private houses in Sandakan; in May 1942 they were transferred to the prison camp on Berhala Island in Sandakan Harbour. Here Graham, his older sister Sheena and their mother were separated from their father. After eight months, the women and children were sent from Berhala Island to Batu Lintang camp in Kuching, Sarawak arriving at the camp after a nine-day difficult sea journey on 21 January 1943.Agnes Newton Keith, 1947, Three Came Home 90-3 Graham's father arrived in Kuching some six weeks later. Batu Lintang was to be Graham's home for the next two years and nine months. One of the female internees at Batu Lintang, Hilda Bates, recorded her thoughts about Graham in her account of her internment: > My favourite [of the 35 children in the camp] was Ronald ; a tough three- > year old, and quite the naughtiest child in the camp! He possessed an > angelic face, wavy golden hair, large blue eyes with long lashes, and an > attractive Scottish accent. This little wretch often escaped punishment for > his crimes, simply because of his appearance, and the artless gaze of his > big blue eyes when being pulled up! When his mother was ill, Ronald was left > in my care, and whenever he became too naughty, I would say \\"Now, bend over, > Ronald!\\" As I then produced a small cane, prepared to whack him, he would > turn his head and give me such an appealing look, saying: ‚ÄúOh Batesie, you > wouldn't, would you?‚Äù And I would end by giving him just a tiny smack!Ooi, > Keat Gin, 1998, Japanese Empire in the Tropics: Selected Documents and > Reports of the Japanese Period in Sarawak, Northwest Borneo, 1941‚Äì1945 Ohio > University Center for International Studies, Monographs in International > Studies, SE Asia Series 101 (2 vols), 322-3 The camp was liberated on 11 September 1945, and after a period of recuperation on Labuan Island the Graham family returned to the UK. His parents eventually returned to Sandakan, but Graham remained in the UK, to be educated at Gordonstoun and later at Trinity College, Dublin, where he studied English and was a keen member of the drama society. He then undertook an MA in contemporary literature at Birmingham University. Career =Writing and producing= Graham began his writing career in 1966 when his play Aberfan, Or How The Abnormally High Welsh Rainfalls and the Amazingly High Scottish Wind Pressure Brought About A Dislocation of Scottish And Welsh Responsibilities (or more succinctly, Aberfan) was performed at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The play interwove the stories of two disasters: the Aberfan colliery disaster and the Tay Bridge disaster, was performed mainly by children and received a rave notice in The Scotsman. His second play An Expedition to Pick Mushrooms was staged in 1967, also at the Traverse Theatre. In 1968 Graham became a researcher and writer for the television sports documentary series Sports Arena, which was presented by Michael Parkinson. In 1974 Graham wrote the screenplay for the horror film Shanks, directed by \\"Hollywood B-movie veteran\\" William Castle and starring Marcel Marceau. It was \\"generally acknowledged as the weirdest project ever to emerge from a major studio\\" and was critically panned. The next year Graham co-wrote a television movie, Strange New World and started to make his career in crime dramas, writing for The Sweeney. In all, he contributed six episodes between 1975‚Äì78: \\"Queen's Pawn\\", \\"Cover Story\\", \\"Supersnout\\", \\"Thou Shalt Not Kill\\" (all 1975), \\"Lady Luck\\" (1976) and \\"Nightmare\\" (1978). Graham was chosen as the screenwriter of the first film spin-off of the series, Sweeney!, which was released in 1977. The film's producer Ted Childs commented: ‚ÄúI felt that he had a cinematic understanding that not all television writers had ... It needed to have a larger than life quality, which Ranald was able to bring to it.\\" Graham went on to write for The Professionals, contributing five episodes between 1978 and 1982: \\"Blind Run\\" and \\"Fall Girl\\" (both 1978), \\"Wild Justice\\" (1980), \\"Operation Susie\\" and \\"Lawson's Last Stand\\" (both 1982). > The Professionals saw Graham at his most abrasive: the elite CI5 crime- > fighting squad used bad language and wildly underhand methods. Bodie and > Doyle were hard, gritty and unlovable. But the public watched in their > millions. Graham explored the tension between Bodie and Doyle perfectly and > then played them off against Jackson's more benign ‚Äì but equally hard ‚Äì > supremo. Graham's scripts brought an unerring earthiness that equally > shocked and entertained. In 1980 Graham revisited the horror genre, writing an episode of Hammer House of Horror, \\"The Two Faces of Evil\\". This work was followed by the screenplay for Breakout, a film for the Children's Film and Television Foundation in 1983, and three episodes for the Australian version of The Professionals, Special Squad: \\"The Golden Run\\" and \\"Child of Fortune\\" (both 1984) and \\"Wild Man\\" (1985). In 1985 London Weekend Television asked Graham to create the television crime drama series Dempsey and Makepeace. He scripted the opening episode and wrote a further six episodes over its three series run: \\"Armed and Extremely Dangerous\\", \\"Silver Dollar\\", \\"Tequila Sunrise\\", \\"The Bogeyman\\" (all 1985), \\"The Burning Part 1\\", \\"The Burning Part 2\\" and \\"Guardian Angel\\" (all 1986). He also acted as series consultant, and for the third series, as producer. Scorpio, a projected series about an international anti-terrorist squad that was \\"announced in a blaze of glory\\" in 1986, was never made. In 1990 Graham produced Yellowthread Street, a big budget police series set and filmed in Hong Kong and made by Yorkshire Television. Graham's last television work was an appearance as himself in a television documentary about the depiction of police in television dramas, Top of the Cops. =Directing= \\"An able theatre director\\", Graham directed an adaptation of Jean Cocteau's Opium in 1970 at the Dublin Theatre Festival and the Hampstead Theatre. In 1998 he co-directed Claude Harz's Maggie and Delaney with Penny Cherns at London's Rosemary Branch Theatre. =Sport= Graham was a keen sports enthusiast, from his Gordonstoun days onwards. His sporting interests included watching boxing, Scottish rugby and English cricket. He directed a London Weekend Television documentary on squash player Jonah Barrington, with whom he had been at university. In 2000, he was a technical consultant on the movie Snatch, advising on the boxing scenes, and in 2005 he co-wrote with its subject the biography of the boxer Joe Egan, titled Big Joe Egan, the Toughest White Man on the Planet. Personal life Graham was \\"gregarious, a lovely teller of tales\\". He married (and divorced) twice. His first wife was Judy Monahan, with whom he had a son, Seorais; his second wife was Carolyn Trayler, with whom he had two daughters, Skye and Georgia. Graham died of motor neurone disease on 29 August 2010. Works =Film= *Shanks (1974) screenwriter *Sweeney!

Respective language integrations adhere to the constructs of that language, including syntactic and directive sugars. Additional APIs exist, beyond simple transaction demarcation, providing for the more advanced capabilities necessary to address practical issues found when dealing with performance optimization and scalability for systems with large amounts of data, many concurrent users, network latency, disk bottlenecks, etc. Versant Corporation Versant Corporation was an American- based software company building specialized NoSQL data management systems. Versant products are deployed in industries including: telecommunications, defense, life sciences, biomedical, transportation, finance, and online gaming. Versant was founded in Menlo Park, California (USA) in 1988. It was headquartered in Redwood City, California. Engineering teams were located in Hamburg, Germany and Redwood City. =History= The company was founded by Dr. Kee Ong in August 1988 as \\"Object Sciences Corporation\\". Ong previously worked with the open-source relational database management system Ingres. Around this time object-oriented programming (OO) became popular, and the company used research done at the University of Wisconsin for a commercial database system to complement OO languages. The company's initial executive team included Michael Seashols (CEO), Dr. Keo Ong (CTO), John Hughes (VP, Sales), Dr. Mary Loomis (VP, Services) and Susan Dickerson (VP, Business Development). In early 1990 the company was renamed ‚ÄúVersant Object Technology.‚Äù In April 1993 David Banks took over as CEO. On July 18, 1996 Versant had their initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange and traded under the symbol VSNT. The company raised $14.9 million from the IPO, and was based in Menlo Park, California at the time, but moved to Fremont, California in 1997. In January 1998 Nick Ordon succeeded Banks as CEO. on July 15, 1998 the company was renamed again to Versant Corporation. In March 2004, Versant acquired Poet Software GmbH, a European-focused company targeting the Windows product market which had traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. In 2005, Jochen Witte, president of Poet Software, took over as CEO of Versant Corporation. In August 2005, the common stock had a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. On December 1, 2008 Versant acquired the assets of the database software business of Servo Software, Inc. (formerly named db4objects, Inc.). It developed the open source embedded database technology db4o. The original implementation of Versant was targeted at C, C++ and Smalltalk users. In 1995 Versant introduced support for the Java programming language and then in 2009 for C# and the .NET platform. In 2012 Versant introduced Versant JPA, a Java Persistence API 2.0 compliant interface for its object database, with a technical preview of an analytics product including Apache Hadoop support. In late 2012, after rejecting an offer by UNICOM Systems Inc., Versant Corporation announced it was being acquired by Actian Corporation, the commercial developer of Ingres and the relational database, Vectorwise. The acquisition was promoted using the marketing term big data. It closed in December for an estimated $37 million. =Products= Other than Versant Object Database, Versant marketed two other commercial object-oriented database management systems (OODBMS), ‚ÄúVersant JPA,‚Äù and \\"Versant FastObjects\\". In addition, Versant offers the open-source database \\"db4o\\". * Versant JPA is a JPA 2.0 compliant interface for its object database that includes a technical preview of an analytics platform including Hadoop support.[3] ‚ÄúNew Versant JPA Delivers Multiple NoSQL Analytics,‚Äù Dr. Dobb‚Äôs Journal.

Versant is found in applications within industries where those characteristics come into play: global trading platforms for the world‚Äôs largest stock exchanges; network management for the world‚Äôs largest telecommunications providers; intelligence analytics for defense agencies; reservation systems for the largest airline/hotel companies; risk management analytics for banking and transportation organizations; massive multi-player gaming systems; network security and fraud detection; local number portability; advanced simulations; and social networking.  Feature highlights  *Transparent object persistence from C++, Java and .NET *Support for standards, e.g., JDO *Seamless database distribution *Enterprise-class high availability *Dynamic schema evolution *Low administration *Multithreading, multisession *End-to-end object architecture *Fine-grained concurrency control  Supported languages  Primary supported languages are Java, C# and C++. Versant also has language support for Smalltalk and Python.  Query systems  VOD supports queries via a server side indexing and query execution engine. Query support includes both a Versant-specific and a standards-based query language syntax. Versant provides this query capability in a number of forms depending on the developer's chosen language binding. For example, in Java VOD provides VQL (Versant Query Language), JDOQL, EJB QL and OQL. In C++ Versant provides VQL and OQL, with C# support for VQL, OQL and LINQ. VOD will do optimization of query execution based on available attribute indexes. Versant also has support for standard SQL queries against the Versant database using ODBC/JDBC drivers. = Versant Query Language = The native Versant Query Language (VQL) is similar to SQL92. It is a string based implementation which allows parameterized runtime binding. The difference is that instead of targeting tables and columns, it targets classes and attributes. Other object-oriented elements apply to query processing. For example, a query targeting a super class will return all instances of concrete subclasses that satisfy the query predicate. VOD is a distributed database: a logical database can be composed of many physical database nodes, with queries are performed in parallel. Versant query support includes most of the core concepts found in relational query languages including: pattern matching, join, set operators, orderby, existence, distinct, projections, numerical expressions, indexing, cursors, etc.  Indexing  VOD supports indexes on large collections. However it is not necessary to have a collection in order to have a queryable object with a usable index. Unlike other OODB implementations, any object in a Versant database is indexable and accessible via query. Indexes can be placed on attributes of classes and those classes can then be the target of a query operation. Indexes can be hash, b-tree, unique, compound, virtual and can be created online either using a utility, via a graphical user interface or via an API call.  Large collection support  VOD provides pagination support for large collections using a special node based implementation. These collections are designed in such a way that access is done so that only nodes needed by the client are brought resident into memory, instead of having to load the entire collection. These large collections are created and operated on just as other persistent collection classes. The interface is also consistent with the appropriate language constructs. For example, C++ Standard Template Library, Java iterators, C# enumerables, etc. Collections of objects by default are only a collection of object identifiers. So, these can be very large, yet have a small resident memory footprint. To iterate the collection, objects are dereferenced into client memory space in either a configurable batch mode or one at a time. A query on the collection can be done using the \\"in\\" operator (or other set based operators like subset_of, superset_of, etc.) without loading the collection to the client memory space.  Data replication  There are several mechanisms for replication on VOD that depend on the motivation behind the replication. It is for high availability or for distribution or integration. = High availability = Versant does synchronous pair replication. Full replication for fault tolerance only requires installation of one configuration file specifying the buddy node names: New connections notice the existence of the replica file and on connect, check the file for a buddy pair and if it exists, connect to both buddies. This could be a distributed database so that there are many buddy pairs. Then all transactional changes are committed synchronously to the buddy database server processes. If any one of the databases in the buddy pair should become unreachable, the in-flight transactions are handled so that there is no commit failure, instead in-flight transactions on node failure will continue to the node that is still alive in the buddy pair. On the machine where the node is still alive and processing transactions, a new process will start that monitors for the crashed database to become accessible again. Once the previously failed node is alive, the monitoring process starts replicating all changes that have occurred since the time of failure to bring the two buddies back into full synchronization. Once they are in full sync, a flag is set and on the next transaction clients will move back to full synchronous operation. All of this is handled without any user involvement. In the case of extreme failure, like a broken disk drive, etc., the replicated node can be recreated from an online backup of the live node. Simply install a new disk drive, take an online backup of the live node, restore on the failed machine, start the monitor to sync the last few transactions and restore full replication at clients. = Distribution = Distribution is handled using Versant Asynchronous Replication (VAR), a channel driven, master-slave or peer-to-peer replication framework with rule based conflict detection and resolution. An administrator uses a utility to define replication channels. Channels are named entities that define a scope of replication within a physical node. The \\"scope\\" can be anything from full database replication to something as fine grained as anything definable by a Versant query. Once the channels are defined, applications can register as listeners on these channels, at which point changes from those channel begin to flow to the respective clients. These channels provide both persistence and reliable messaging. In the event that a connection is lost between a registered listener and a channel, ongoing changes will be guaranteed delivery once the connection is re-established. There are multiple transport protocols that can be configured for optimization in highly reliable LAN networks or high reliability in unreliable WAN type of environments. In bi-directional channel replication, a set of conflict detection rules are put in place so that conflicting changes can be resolved at runtime without disrupting channel activity. There are other forms of data distribution. = Integration = Usually, integration requires some kind of custom code. Users can connect to both relational and Versant databases using ORM products. They can load objects either from a relational database or Versant and then with some minor code implementation, disconnect those objects from the source and write them to a target. This can be used for import/export in a batch processing mode for integration with other database systems.  Data distribution architecture  VOD handles distributed data processing using a distributed two-phase commit protocol across multiply connected databases. In this process, VOD uses an internal resource manager that is handling the distributed transactions. Versant also supports the XA protocol allowing external transaction monitors to control the transactional context, so for example plug into a CORBA or J2EE application server. Versant allows object relationships to span physical resource (database) nodes. Shared information referenced from object graphs that reside in other databases and resolution of that information is transparent at runtime. For example, several physical databases may hold user information models that are partitioned by account number holding aggregations on account activities such as trades and then have some more databases holding actual trade models and these users and trades can be related. A query across all of the user databases and return a user (or set of users), then as messages are sent to user objects involving trades, the trade models will automatically be resolved across the distribution. After updates of any of those objects, at commit time Versant will ensure that all changes commit back to their respective physical nodes in a completely ACID 2phase commit process. Object id‚Äôs are guaranteed to be unique across all physical nodes. Objects could be \\"moved\\" from one physical node to another without any application code changes required.  Schema evolution  Schema evolution is handled via a normal update of the application's class models and then applying those changes to the operational database. Those schema changes can be applied to an existing database either via a utility or API. The result is a versioning of the database schema. Existing objects in the database are lazily evolved to the latest schema version. No object is actually evolved unless it is made dirty (marked for update) and committed back to the database. In general this means an application with the new schema will not cause evolution, except for new and updated objects. There are utilities that can \\"crawl\\" a database slowly evolving all instanced to the latest version by grabbing sets of them, marking them dirty, committing. This is sometimes desired for embedded or real-time systems where performance and space needs to be optimized. In most cases, older clients get patch updates with the new schema in conjunction with updates to the server. The clients schema version is in sync with the database server. Versant‚Äôs loose schema mapping facility can also be used. This is enabled by a flag in the client so that it does not complain about a mismatch in schema version and instead filters the incoming objects to match the old schema. Using this facility requires some forethought to avoid any unintended side effects. The process goes as follows: # class definitions are updated, i.e. add new subclasses, add attributes, rename attributes, remove attributes, etc. and recompile. When the application connects to a Versant database, a schema version mismatch will be detected and you would normally get an error unless you take some action to avoid the mismatch. # The schema mismatch can be avoided using a number of techniques. ## a utility can be used to describe the new schema to the database. The utility will show a list of incompatibilities and ask how you want them to be resolved. Your action will depend on whether you are in development, QA, production, etc. Regardless, actions like dropping the existing class, evolving the schema version and keeping all existing objects, rename and retype, etc., are also possible. ## the evolution process can be automated via connection options. This is normally used in development mode and allows the schema to automatically evolve any mismatches on connect and continue preserving the existing objects. ## specific API‚Äôs can be used to dynamically evolve the database schema. This is an advanced topic, involving what's called Versant runtime classes. Basically, you can create completely dynamic schema structure for the database so that new classes and attributes can be created on the fly. # If clients with the older schema continue to operate on the database, loose_schema_mapping in the application profile file should be set to true. # Optionally, a utility can be started to crawl the database and force version migration of all existing instances. The general guidelines for schema evolution are that any schema changes can be made and existing instances preserved, without having to write custom evolution code, with the exception of two things: # Changes to the middle of an inheritance hierarchy. Inserting a new class into the middle of a hierarchy is impossible without losing your existing objects, unless custom code is written to do this operation in a series of steps. # Incompatible type changes like Array to a String. All other forms of evolution like renaming attributes, deleting leaf classes, adding leaf classes, adding new classes, adding or removing attributes, etc. can be done online and without custom code. If actions like setting non standard default values for newly added attributes are necessary, this can be done in callback functions within the objects. There are a set of standard object lifecycle callbacks that get invoked in activities like cache load. Those callbacks can be used to check for default values and take action if necessary.  Persistent object lifecycle  The lifecycle of an object load can be controlled on a use case basis. By default, objects are loaded only when they are sent a message. This includes the default behavior for queries which only return a collection of references to objects that satisfied the query predicate, not the actual objects. When an object is loaded, all its non-reference attributes (primitives) are also loaded and remaining reference types follow the same pattern as the referencing object. When a message is sent to an object VOD looks into internal structures to see if the object is already in client memory. If not, VOS does an RPC to load the object. At the time VOD loads the object, it will also look at the connections locking strategy to decide how to deal with locking the object on load. VOD supports both global locking strategies that can be applied to a connection and extremely fine grained control to override behavior for a particular use case. Once an object is loaded and locked it stays in the client cache, with an equivalent lock in the server, until one of a number of events occurs. The most common event, the current transaction ends with commit. In the default case, this will release the lock and object from memory. However, note that there are forms of commit that will do combinations of things like, keep the cache and the locks and start a new transaction, keep the cache, but release the locks and start a new transaction. These forms and others are used to optimize cache effectiveness when using non-default locking strategies like optimistic locking or when you have a series of transactions that form a task and operate on the same set of objects. Another possibility is that your client cache starts to get full. In this case, VOD may decide to swap objects back to the server process to make space and do some work that will have to be done at commit anyway. VOD does this in a fully transactional way, so that even if modified objects get swapped to the server, they will still be undone if the transaction is rolled back. Also, you have the ability to \\"pin\\" objects into the client cache to prevent swapping of important sets of objects, enabling the use of direct memory pointers without concern for memory faults. Another possible event is a query call which has the option set to flush the cache of objects in the target class, so that changed objects currently in your cache become part of the current query execution evaluation. Other possibilities include API calls that result in explicit release of the object, like a call to refresh or a call to release. There are many ways to override the default behavior. Those are in fact commonly used to performance tune on a use case basis. For example, if you are going to iterate over a collection of 1000 objects, you don‚Äôt want to do 1000 RPC‚Äôs. Giving the collection of references to a call to groupRead will use a single RPC and load all objects. Similarly, you can make a call to getClosure which will use groupRead behavior to load all referenced objects in a graph from the starting point, down to your specified level of reachability. Further, queries have options to set a lock and load result sets rather than just references or to use cursors. There are API‚Äôs to explicitly load objects into cache and set higher lock levels than the connection defaults, etc. Achieving persistence For users of C++, Versant requires that the uppermost class in an inheritance hierarchy inherit from a base class \\"PObject\\", which handles database activities. Then there is a file setup, \`schema.imp\`, that declares which classes in the model are to be made persistent and that file is used in a pre-compilation phase where Versant's necessary magic is added to the persistent classes. Finally, the resulting \`schema.cxx\` file is compiled and linked with the application. The pre-compilation phase is done with a utility though note this is typically automatically set up in one's visual development environment so the process is automatic when a build is done. When using Java or .NET, this same procedure described above with C++ is accomplished using post-processing byte code enhancement. One sets up a file that declares which classes are to be persistent and then uses a utility, or API, or IDE integration to enhance the classes before running or debugging. Versant provides other Java APIs based on standards JDO and JPA. In those versions of the API, the system adheres to the standards defined for declaring persistence whether it be some kind of XML or annotation. Enhancement is then done using a utility (similarly with .NET) or more commonly with Eclipse plug-in or Microsoft Visual Studio integration during the build process.  Integration with relational databases  A large percentage of Versant‚Äôs customers do some form of integration with relational tables. This can be accomplished in a couple of ways depending on the requirements such as: on-line/off-line, batch based, transactional, etc. = XA = Versant supports the XA protocol for distributed transactions. This allows participation in online distributed transactions with relational databases. The interaction with the relational tables can take many forms from custom code to ORM solutions to J2EE application servers (Entity Relationship Modeling) to message passing to ORBs, etc. The XA API allows the Versant database to act as a resource controlled by an external transaction monitor coordinating changes to both Versant and relational databases in the same transactional context. =ORM= Versant can interact with relational databases using Java ORM technology such as JDO (Java Data Objects) and Hibernate JPA. These standards-based implementations have the ability to detach objects from their transactional context and then attach them to another connection. There are restrictions in that Versant requires the application to use a concept known as database identity in order for replication to work with relations intact. Versant does not support the ORM form of application identity in anything other than a disconnected data form. =XML= Versant has tools that enable the import and export of XML data. For example, batch based replication of data can be accomplished by exporting objects from the Versant database as XML, if necessary applying an XSLT transform and then importing into relational tables. The opposite direction is also possible. With Java, the most common approach using XML is to dynamically replicate information using JAXB which runtime converts objects into and out of an XML form. Using JAXB, the Versant database only needs to work with objects rather than importing an XML form. In essence, XML coming from relational databases are converted to objects at runtime using JAXB and those objects are then persisted into the Versant database. =Custom code= Users of C++ are especially challenged in integrating with relational databases. Versant provides consulting to help these customers with their integration challenges, but does not make those solutions, which require customization for each application, available in a productized form. Transactions Versant by default is always implicitly in a transaction when connected to the database. In addition, VOD supports the XA protocol and apply that to certain standards based API‚Äô such as JDO and JPA which require explicit transaction demarcation. There is a non-implicit form of transaction where transaction begin/end must be declared. In order to discard from memory objects that have been modified in the current transaction you can either do it globally for the current transaction by issuing a rollback which also implicitly starts another transaction or you can do it in isolation or globally using specific calls within the same transaction. Locking and caching strategies Versant by default uses a pessimistic locking strategy to ensure that objects in the database server are in sync with client access in an ACID way. This is done by using a combination of locks against both schema and instance objects. The database server process maintains lock request queues at the object level to control concurrency of access to the same object. A request for update will establish a queue if there are any existing readers of an object. The request either goes through when all current readers release their locks or times-out (an exception which can be handled by client is thrown). Locks are generally released at transaction boundaries. When a queue is established by an update request, all other subsequent requests fall in queue behind the update request. Once the update request has been filled, all read requests in the queue rush in and get their read lock, return the object, and if there are no other updates, the queue disappears. In this architecture, locks are done at the object level so false waits and false deadlocks do not occur. Other ways of keeping client caches in sync are, for example, an optimistic locking strategy, using a classic timestamp mechanism. VOD also provides forms of client cache synchronization using multi-cast. Additionally it provides an event mechanism where clients can register for triggering events within the database server to be used for synchronization or for business logic work flow. Scalability =Storage= Versant supports, multiple file and multiple process configurations. Data storage is done in a single or multiple files, but there are supporting files for the logging subsystem (logical and physical log files). These logging files are used for high performance and scalability under concurrent user loads and for online database backup processes. =Clients= Versant is a multi-user client server database and has production applications with thousands of concurrently connected users. Thus, Versant can also run linked and embedded in the same address space as the application process (so it can be also an embedded database). Performance Versant uses internal performance and scalability benchmarks to monitor and measure behavior over time across releases, patches and generations of new hardware. Versant has done other non-standard benchmarking activities in a public forum. \\"Poleposition, the open source database benchmark\\",polepos.org. Retrieved 24 February 2011. .\\"Accelerating IBM WebSphere Application Server Performance with Versant enJin\\", ibm.com. Retrieved 6 October 2010. Versant ran the 007 benchmarks in the early 1990s but currently doesn‚Äôt provide any comparisons because there are no industry benchmarks that make sense for object databases, One of the candidates considered was TPC-E, which was supposed to be the new OLTP standard database benchmark with new complex models aimed at being representative of today‚Äôs computing environment. The TPC-E is based on a financial trading system model. Still, comparative results could not be obtained. The reason is that the TPC specifies requirements regarding what part of the code resides in the \\"driver\\" of the benchmark and what part resides in \\"database\\" functionality. However, the driver to application logic interface is completely defined at the data level. This means that when measuring relational access you would not incur any overhead for mapping into a C++ object. The mapping of the raw data into what ever form was necessary in the driver to implement the business logic was completely outside of the benchmark measurements. When it comes to the object database, you need to now un-map the C++ objects into the driver data structures and in doing so, measure the cost of that activity as part of the benchmark timings. But this is the opposite of a real world application where people write object oriented applications resulting in object oriented models. In a relational database, you need to map/un-map from objects to the relational data structures. The TPC-E was written in a way as to exclude the \\"mapping effect\\" from the measurements, which by the very nature of how an object database works means the TPC-E was written in a way that forces measurement of an \\"un-mapping effect\\", an activity which does not occur in a real world application. Thus with TPC-E, the true cost of computing is removed for relational and even worse added to object databases. Add-on Modules Versant provides add-on modules for deployment or access to its Object Database. *V/Management Center: V/MC delivers real-time views of performance data and analytical information about the Versant Object Database. For example, it alerts administrators about potential issues before the database availability is affected. It's designed as an Eclipse-based RCP client. *Versant Compact: Online Database Maintenance. *Versant FTS: High Availability Database Server. *Versant Async Server: Production Database Replication. *Versant HA Backup: High Availability Backup Solution. *Versant SQL: SQL Access & Reporting. Applications Usually the \\"best kind of application\\" to use a Versant database are those applications requiring an application specific database of an online transaction processing nature. There are certain application characteristics where Versant technology provides better performance and scalability than traditional relational technology: complex models, large amount of data, large number of concurrent users. VOD was used applications such as: global trading platforms for large stock exchanges, network management for large telecommunications providers, intelligence analytics for defense agencies, reservation systems for large airline/hotel companies, risk management analytics for banking and transportation organizations, massively multiplayer online game systems, network security and fraud detection, local number portability, advanced simulations and social networking.

On 9 July 1980, the Crocodile Club a group of MEPs was founded by Altiero Spinelli himself. For more than 60 years, Union of European Federalists (UEF) and its youth organisation Young European Federalists (JEF) with a \\"belief that only a European Federation, based on the idea of unity in diversity, could overcome the division of the European continent\\" have been actively working to promote the idea of European federalism. MEP Andrew Duff and president of UEF has welcomed the launching of the Spinelli Group saying, that \\"existing federalist forces and organisations, such as the UEF and the Intergroup, welcome this new initiative\\".  Manifesto  With a manifesto online, recalling the Ventotene Manifesto written by Altiero Spinelli, Group activists call members of the European Parliament and Europe's citizens to sign it and add their names to the list of those fighting against nationalism and intergovernmentalism. By supporting the aims and principles laid out in the manifesto, Spinelli group followers try to speed up the process of European integration and promote a federal Europe.  Members  The Spinelli Group is organised in three sections. * The Steering Group gathers the 33 founding members and newcomers‚Äîpoliticians and thinkers dedicated to building a federal Europe. * The MEP Spinelli Group gathers 108 MEPs who signed the manifesto. They look for strategies and majorities in the European Parliament to push the pro-European, federal, and post-national agenda. * The Spinelli Network Group is made of every citizen who signed the manifesto of the Spinelli Group. As of 8 May 2017, they are 7,327. They participate in debates and fora. This pro-European initiative is supported by prominent political leaders such as former Commission President Jacques Delors, former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, former competition commissioner Mario Monti and MEP Andrew Duff, President of the Union of European Federalists (UEF), and other well known public bodies. It is also enthusiastically supported by such European Union promoters as former European Parliament President Pat Cox and current Parliament Vice-President Isabelle Durant (Greens/EFA; Belgium).

Biography Fowler was born in 1980 in Canberra, Australia. He lives and works in Melbourne, Victoria. He holds a Master of Contemporary Art from the Victorian College of the Arts. Fine art career In 2001, at age 21, Fowler held his first solo exhibition Raiders of the Lost Art at A.R.T. Gallery Eden in Melbourne. His exhibition included stencils, paintings and rock carvings. According to the new McCulloch Encyclopedia of Australian Art, this exhibition was \\"one of the first private gallery exhibitions in Melbourne by a graffiti artist.\\"McCulloch Encyclopedia of Australian Art 2007 Edition (page 915) Raiders of the Lost Art was the subject of an article titled \\"The Street Artist Who Came in from the Cold\\". The article discussed Fred's artwork, both on the street and in the gallery, and also discussed the graffiti movement more widely. The journalist, Jane Faulkner, drew parallels between Fred's work and that of other artists before him like Henri Matisse and Jackson Pollock. She commented that \\"what unites these artists is experimentation: a word that has become synonymous with 20th century art.\\"The Street Artist Who Came in from The Cold. Article by Jane Faulkner. The Age, 6 June 2001 In 2008, Fred held his second solo exhibition Highland Chamber at Until Never gallery in Hosier Lane. His set of five silkscreen prints were praised by reviewer Ross Moore as \\"a suite of fastidiously elegant black and white ink drawings.\\"Sightlines: Galleries - 'Write Stuff' Review by Ross Moore. The Age, 20 June 2008. In 2010, Fred's work was a part of the National Gallery of Australia exhibition Space Invaders. The exhibition opened on 30 October and toured to Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales in 2011. In 2012, Fred held his third solo exhibition \\"Decorating the Apocalypse\\" at Backwoods Gallery in Melbourne. He exhibited acrylic paintings and a suite of bronze masks - commercial iconography clashed with graffiti tribalism. Fowler's forth solo exhibition \\"New Landscapes\\" opened in June 2014 at Backwoods Gallery in Melbourne. \\"New Landscapes\\" featured a series of oil paintings that use the vehicle of landscape painting to explore the relationship between native and invasive species, analogous to the effect of colonisation on the indigenous population of Australia. \\"New Landscapes\\" received widespread acclaim and established Fowler as an important contemporary artist engaged with the Australian landscape, and also issues surrounding contemporary Australian identity. In an essay about the exhibition, Emily McCulloch Childs wrote \\"Fowler‚Äôs new landscapes evoke all that is ancient and beautiful about this land, and simultaneously, subtly, that which is more recent, brutal and confronting. They are a much needed, thoughtful exploration of these issues of land, animals, plants and humans, adding much to the discussion of Australia‚Äôs past and its present condition.\\" Education Fowler completed a Master of Contemporary Art at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne, graduating in 2011. Fred's supervisor in his first year was Lecturer Jon Campbell, and in his second year, Associate Professor Jon Cattapan. Fred's areas of interest while studying at VCA were painting, etching and sculpture. Fowler's sculptural practice was mentored by Dr Tim Edwards, who taught Fowler the Lost Wax Method of casting bronze sculptures.

At age 11, Fred started experimenting with tagging in his local neighbourhood. At 15, Fred began creating throw-ups and pieces under various aliases, and at 16, Fred was given the name NUROCK by his graffiti mentor, DUET. It was from this point on, with the name NUROCK, that Fred began to paint regularly. Fred painted on train lines and public walls and also on trains, buses and trams. Fred gained notoriety painting as NUROCK both with his peers and with the general public: \\"In this sub-culture, Nurock is a bit of a legend.

The new ship was intended to serve in Italy's colonial empire in eastern Africa, and was designed to be able to operate at long range, far from home ports, for an extended period of time. The Regia Marina ultimately sold the ship in March 1907, though her ultimate fate is unknown. Design In the late 1880s, the Italian Regia Marinas chief designer, Benedetto Brin, prepared the design for a new corvette to replace the earlier .

Later in the ship's career, two of these guns were removed. In addition to those guns, she carried two 24-caliber guns.

Xavier High School is a Catholic systemic school that is supported and partially funded by the Catholic School's Office, Diocese of Wagga Wagga, continuing a long history of Catholic education in the region, forming from the amalgamation of St Joseph's College for girls and the Aquinas Boys College in 1983. The school caters for over 900 students from Year 7 to Year 12. The Principal of the school is Gavin Dykes with the school motto reading \\"The Truth Will Set You Free\\"- a direct reference to the Gospel of John, verse 8:32.  History and amalgamation  Catholic schooling in the Albury region has experienced a long and successful tradition, dating back to 1868, wherein the Sisters Of Mercy established St Brigid's College on a small block of land owned by St Patrick's Parish, in South Albury. In 1885, Patrician Brothers opened a school for boys in an adjacent block in Olive Street, also owned by St Patrick's Parish. This school for boys was re-inaugurated by the Christian Brothers in 1917, the same year St Brigid's College was redeveloped and renamed, St Joseph's Ladies College. For the majority of a decade, The Sisters of Mercy and Christian Brothers delivered Catholic-based education to thousands of students across the area. All teaching during this time period was performed by clergy of the Church, linking closely with St Patrick's Parish. In 1959, a northern campus of the Boys College was established in Fallon Street North Albury, the site of the present day Xavier High. This establishment was named Aquinas College. In 1983, the boys and girls schools were amalgamated to create a co-educational system under the name \\"Xavier High School\\", named after Saint Francis Xavier. The campuses remained separated until January 2001 wherein the school united to share the redeveloped Northern campus, the site of the present day school. The school promotes its history to the student body, with many of the 8 Houses within the school named after the aforementioned colleges.

Although the university was established in 1955, its history stems back to 1944 with the creation of the Agrarian and Veterinary Faculties within the new Maria Curie- Sk≈Çodowska University (UMCS). In 1955, these two faculties, together with the Faculty of Zootechnics (est. 1953), were spun off to create a new institution, originally called the Lublin Higher School of Agriculture. It was called the Lublin Agricultural Academy from 1972, and took its present name in 2008.University History - University of Life Sciences in Lublin  History  The university traditions date back to 1944, when the first four Faculties were created at the recently established Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska University in Lublin: Medical, Life Sciences, Agricultural and Veterinary. Among the sequentially formed faculties, in 1953 the Department of Animal Husbandry began its operations. In 1955, during a surge of new universities, Professor Bohdan Dobrza≈Ñski, the Rector of Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska University at the time, was appointed to create an independent scientific ‚Äì didactic and research unit from the Faculties of Agriculture, Veterinary and Zootechnics. With the Resolution No. 503 of the Council of Ministers from 6 August 1955, The Higher School of Agriculture was established in Lublin. Professor Bohdan Dobrza≈Ñski became its first Rector. The dynamic development of the university and the expansion of its activities led to the establishment of two more Departments in 1970 - Horticulture (renamed Horticulture and Landscape Architecture in 2010) and Agricultural Engineering (renamed Production Engineering in 2003). In accordance with the Council of Ministers Resolution of 23 September 1972, the university was given a new name ‚Äì since then, for over 35 years, it was known as the Agricultural University in Lublin. In 1960 the Agrarian Faculty was renamed the Agricultural Faculty and in 2007 its name was changed once again to the Agrobioengineering Faculty. Similarly, in 1995 the Veterinary Faculty was renamed the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and in 1998, the Animal Husbandry Faculty was transformed into the Faculty of Biology and Animal Breeding. In May 2005, the Senate established the sixth faculty ‚Äì the Faculty of Food Science and Biotechnology and in 2006, it established the seventh one - the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences in Zamo≈õƒá (former Institute of Agricultural Sciences), which operated until its closure in 2015. On 6 March 2008, the Polish government passed a law which changed the names of some agricultural colleges. After the bill was approved by the Senate and validated by the President of Poland it was published in the Official Gazette and became effective as of 11 April 2008. During the solemn ceremony held on 17 April 2008, the name of the university was changed to the University of Life Sciences in Lublin. Over the past few years, the university has expanded its research infrastructure.

The Historic Manor House in Felin  The Historic Manor House in Felin The heritage listed manorial complex located in Felin has a representative function for University of Life Sciences in Lublin. The completion of the building dates back to the second half of 19th century and the name Felin was given to honor the Tatary heir's wife, Feliksa. In 1913 the owner of that time Erazm Plewi≈Ñski, who was a well-known social activist, bequeathed the property to Agricultural Society in Lublin so that it could be converted into the School of Agriculture. The manor underwent the most significant changes during World War II when it was used as the headquarters of Colonel Klauss, one of the Nazi officials. After the war, the property was transferred to UMCS, and became the Department of Agriculture. In 1955 when the Agricultural Academy was established, the property was allotted to it to become the headquarters of the Experimental Management Department. After the major repairs, in 1990, the manor was registered as a heritage of culture of Lublin Voivodship. The manor has a representative hall as well as a well- preserved former floor plan. The elements worth mentioning include a period fireplace in the Hall and stucco on the ceilings.

It is native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Except immediately after heavy rains, its straight stems usually lack leaves, giving it a broom-like appearance. The Latin specific epithet montana refers to mountains or coming from mountains.Archibald William Smith Description It is a shrub with many straight, broom-like, yellow-green, 30 to 60 centimetres long. Except after heavy rains, it is usually found without leaves. Leaves and stems Stems are speckled with resin glands. Leaves are small and occur only after rains, then fall off (drought deciduous). Inforescence and fruit Flowers occur at intervals along the stem. Each has a greenish base of blunt sepals. The corolla is oval with rounded ends. The petals royal purple in color. Like most other parts of the plant, petals are studded with visible resin glands. The tips of the petals curve outward, revealing a protruding stigma and shorter yellow-tipped stamens. The fruit is a leathery, yellow-green, gland-spotted capsule with two nearly separate rounded lobes. Within the capsule are pale, kidney-shaped seeds about 4 millimeters long each. The fruits are eaten by animals which then disperse the seeds. Range and habitat It grows in dry desert scrub, juniper woodland, and other desert plant communities. It grows among desert plants such as creosote, blackbrush, ephedra, and Yucca species such as Joshua Tree.US Forest Service Fire Ecology Uses and ecological interactions Many Native American groups used it as a ceremonial drug, and held beliefs it could be used as a medicine and for pest control.Ethnobotany References External links *Jepson Manual Treatment *Photo gallery montana ","title":"Thamnosma montana"},{"id":"29079898","text":"Fletcherella is a genus of moths in the family Pterophoridae.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The church is unusual because it is one of only two churches in Gloucestershire with a hexagonal tower, the other being St Lawrence's Church in Swindon. You can find the church by following signs for 'Historic Church' and for Newark Park nearby. By car, park outside the Ozleworth Estate, near to the gates, and follow a long bridle path downhill and around to the left until you reach the churchyard. Please note - the path can be muddy and slippery. History The church stands in a circular churchyard, suggesting that there was an earlier church on the site, or even that the site could be pre-Christian. However, there is no mention of the church in the Domesday Book. The oldest part of the present church is the tower, which is Norman in style, and which may have acted as the original nave. It probably dates from the 12th century. During the following century a small nave was added to the west of the tower, and the chancel was added to its east side. At that time the nave measured by . In 1732 a west gallery was erected; this was approached from the outside of the church by steps and a south doorway. In 1873 the church was restored by Rev W. H. Lowder. At this time the nave was lengthened by . The church was declared redundant on 1 March 1981, and was vested in The Churches Conservation Trust on 27 October 1982. Architecture The church is constructed in stone, with stone slate roofs. At its centre is a Norman tower, the plan of which is an irregular hexagon. To the east of the tower is a chancel, and to the west is a nave with a south porch. The nave now measures in length. The chancel is about long; its width tapers from at the western end to at the east. The tower is divided into three stages by string courses. In the top stage, in each face, is a two-light window under a round-headed arch. On the summit is a pyramidal roof. In the north and south chancel walls are two single-light windows; between those on the north side is a priest's door with a trefoil head. At the east end is a two-light window above which is a gable with a cross at its apex. The windows in the nave are similar in style to those in the chancel, and between the two windows on the north side is a blocked doorway. The south porch is opposite to this and is gabled. Its inner doorway, dating from the 13th century, has two orders and is elaborately carved. Inside the church, the west tower arch is also elaborately carved. The font dates from the 13th century. In the east window are fragments of medieval stained glass, depicting a saint's head. In the southwest window of the tower are four panels of painted Flemish glass dating from the 16th or 17th century. The remainder of the stained glass is from the 19th century. External features In the churchyard are three groups of monuments, each group comprising a Grade II listed building.

Mahoney located at the Wisconsin Humane Society in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The bronze statue portrays Henry Bergh, the father of the humane movement in the United States, holding a cane in his proper right hand and petting a dog with a bandaged paw with his proper left hand. It was created in 1891 and stands 9 feet high. Description of the sculpture Mahoney's statue is a full-length bronze of Henry Bergh. He wears a frock coat, vest, pants and boots, while holding a cane and petting a wounded dog. The statue's granite base has the raised inscription HENRY BERGH. The right front of the base reads American Bronze Co. Chicago Illinois. There is also a circular plaque on the base that reads The Wisconsin Humane Society, as well as a United States seal with a ribbon and star that included a founder's mark. The circular plaque was added to the base in 1941 in honor of its 50th dedication anniversary. Henry Bergh grew up an aristocrat and graduated from Columbia College in the 1830s. Following college he became a diplomat at the American Delegation in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It was during this time that he noticed the drivers' cruel treatment of horses. Once back in America he realized that Americans also mistreated their horses by requiring them to pull very heavy loads. Bergh traveled to England to learn about their humane society and, upon his return to America in 1866, founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. This was subsequently expanded in 1877 into the American Humane Association, which included both the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The Wisconsin Humane Society was founded in 1879 with Richard D. Whitehead serving as its superintendent. Whitehead commissioned the sculpture, raising the $14,000 needed to create it. The statue was placed in the heavily trafficked Market Square on April 29, 1891 and dedicated with an elaborate ceremony that included releasing white pigeons to fly over the statue, and having a pony be the first to drink from the trough. The statue was unveiled on April 29, 1891, shortly after the 25th anniversary of Bergh's founding of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It was originally placed atop an animal watering trough in downtown Milwaukee's Market Square, near the present City Hall.Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer (1995). Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison Short video of sculpture. =Location history= \\"The Milwaukee City Hall was built on Market Square in 1895, increasing the traffic around the Bergh monument. By 1941 few horses were seen on the streets of Milwaukee and it was decided to convert the watering trough to a flower bed.\\" Since then it has been moved several times. It was first moved to the Wisconsin Humane Society in 1966 when the Marshall and Ilsley Bank planned to build a new structure on its site. Because the statue was too heavy to transport over Milwaukee's bridges, it was taken without the watering trough. The statue has moved with the Wisconsin Humane Society as it has changed locations over the years. It currently stands in front of the Humane Society's building on West Wisconsin Avenue. According to the Wisconsin Humane Society's website, this is the only known statue of Henry Bergh in the United States. =Condition of the statue= \\"Treatment completed to restore statue in June 2013.\\"/> The sculptor James H.

It was designed to carry heavy loads in difficult terrain like swamps, sand and snow in extreme weather conditions. History By the early 1960s, the USSR's increased need for a more advanced ATV was becoming obvious as the single-unit tracked snow and swamp-going vehicles in operation at that time could not carry payloads in excess of 5 tonnes. To fill the need for such vehicles, a specialized design bureau was established with the task of developing articulated tracked vehicles. Also military vehicle able to operate on USSR northern borders was deemed necessary. In February 1971 the first two ATVs, designated DT-LP and DT-L, were produced for the State trials. Three types operational today (DT-10P, DT-20P and DT-30 ATVs) entered service in 1980s. In 1982, the Ishimbai Transport Machine-Building Plant (Ishimbaitransmash) assimilated the series production and turned out the first batch of the DT-10P ATVs. In late 1981, trials of the DT-30P and DT-30 two- unit ATVs were completed. These trials were carried out in severe weather and terrain conditions in various military districts and demonstrated that the vehicles possessed high cross-country ability and load-carrying capacity and could be used effectively to transport military hardware and non-military equipment in severe climatic conditions of the northern part of Russia, in Siberia, and Far East, as well as in the desert. Eventually their performance was found superior to demands, as they outperformed all Russian-made and foreign vehicles of this class. An intensive research and development program continued up to 1985, creating standardised series comprising: * two-unit transport vehicles DT-10, DT-20 and DT-30, with a load-carrying capacity of 10, 20 and 30 tons, respectively; * two-unit amphibious transporters DT-10P, DT-20P and DT-30P with similar specifications as the regular transporters. Today, Vityaz CTVs are in use throughout the whole territory of Russia, as well as in Arctic and Antarctica. They are an invaluable part of the transport services for prominent companies such as Gazprom JSC, Rosneftegazstroi, Rosneftegaz JSC, etc. They serve as primary transport vehicles for the personnel who service the oil and gas pipelines throughout Russia, for geologists and scientists who research the remote and isolated regions. For different industries were produced several specialised versions: DT-30K crane, DT-30E excavator, refuelling vehicles, mobile workshops, mobile oil refineries, passenger transporters, fire-fighting vehicles. Vehicles of kind are in demand not only in Russia, but throughout the countries of the Middle East and Asia, as well as in North and South America. Description The transporters models feature similar configuration. Both units are basically sealed all-welded structures. The vehicle power plant is arranged in the first van behind the driver's cabin. From a 12-cylinder multi-fuel engine the torque is conveyed to a hydro-mechanical transmission via a cardan shaft and further to the bevel gearing and final drive units, as well as to the drive sprockets of the first and second van bodies. The track assembly is made up of four wide rubberised-fabric band tracks reinforced with welded steel cross-pieces; four track guide engagement drive sprockets with nine pairs of polyurethane rollers; road wheels with rubber bands, and four idler wheels (one on either side is provided with a polyurethane rim). The suspension is independent, torsion-bar type, with spring supports on all rollers. Years of operation of these vehicles have proved their reliability and robust design. The vehicle design primarily features an unconventional pattern of four active track envelopes providing for large surface contact with the ground for greater stability. In addition to this feature, these ATVs ensures the so-called \\"kinematic method\\" for turning the articulated tracked vehicle through the \\"forced folding\\" of its units. The kinematic method of turn provides a positive tracking force for all tracks during linear movement and while making turns. A combination of the kinematic method of turn and a powerful multifuel engine, along with a hydro-mechanical transmission, unique track and suspension system with wide band tracks, road wheels with rubber pads, and vertical hydraulic cylinders which allow the two vehicle units to move vertically in relation to each other, make the articulated vehicles with a maximum weight of up to 60 tons more capable in terms of their sand/loose soil/snow-going capacity, than any type of single-unit vehicle. As the two units can be turned relative to each other in the vertical and horizontal planes via hydraulic cylinders or, conversely, can be fixed, the two-unit vehicle can move over short (equal to the length of one unit) sections of difficult terrain and obstacles like ditches and walls and come out of water onto an unprepared bank, ice, or peat. Owing to their unique design, the Vityaz family of ATVs are capable of operating in conditions impossible for other all-terrain vehicles, for example: * amphibious return to a mother ship; * off-road movement with one unit disabled or without one, or even without both tracks of one of the units; * negotiating ditches and clefts up to 4.0 m wide. * unloading of a ship offshore if it cannot come close to waterfront (i.e. in the Arctics and Antarctica regions, or in flooded regions, etc.); negotiating waterways in severe ice conditions; * operation in mountains up to an altitude of 4,000 m. Military use The DT-10P and DT-30P ATVs are widely used by Russian troops deployed in challenging environmental regions, on islands (for transporting army elements, ammunition, equipment, FOLs and installation of weapon systems). Because of low ground pressure, vehicle is theoretically immune to certain types of AT mines. ATVs are indispensable as recovery vehicles, since they have a high pull ratio (approximately 500 kN for the DT-30P) and can approach a stuck or damaged vehicle from any direction in bad road conditions. The DT-10P and DT-30P transporters are very efficient as part of search and rescue teams operating in extreme conditions (bad roads, floods, snow-drifts, land and snow slides and large-scale destruction) when it is necessary to evacuate people, animals, and various cargoes up to 30 ton by weight, or transport rescue teams, medical personnel, various equipment and food to the affected area.

Situated in the capital Windhoek, it was separated from its younger counterpart Delta School Windhoek (DSW), formerly known as German School Windhoek, in January 1975.  Activities  DSSW annually has a Dragon Boat Race at Avis Dam. The event does not only raise money for the students but it also promotes class and school involvement.Delta Dragon Boat Races It also has an annual open air school outing for Grade 8 to Blumfelde and Grade 11 to Rock Lodge. History The secondary school started with 153 scholars who were taught by 10 teachers. During the first few years it occupied the building in Peter M√ºller Street (today Fidel Castro Street) that today houses the College of the Arts. In July 1978 the school moved into the building of the former Kaiserliche Realschule, later known as Deutsche H√∂here Privatschule (DHPS, German Higher Private School), in Leutwein Street (today Robert Mugabe Avenue).DSSW/DOSW YearBook of 2005, The 30th Anniversary of Delta Secondary School Windhoek In 1979, the school was converted into a high school with 33 candidates completing the Matric Examinations (Cape Senior Certificate) in November of that year. At this time the school was under the jurisdiction of the Directorate of Education for the Administration for Whites. This directorate ensured that each scholar had the opportunity to have scholastic education in his/her home language in his/her own culture and social sphere. This insured that all instructions for all subjects until grade 9, used German as colloquial language and as the basis of cultural events. In 1990, the Republic of Namibia became independent. The final (Cape Senior) matrix examinations were written in 1993, which were then replaced by the Namibian and British Cambridge system NSSC (the Namibian Senior Secondary Certificate). English became the language of instruction and all Namibian scholars were allowed to enrol. DSSW was the reception school for expatriate children that grew up in the GDR during the Namibian War of Independence. Those children, known as the GDR Children of Namibia and at the school as GDR-candidates, smoothed the integration process by initiating the social contact with other Namibians. DSSW has been known for its high academic performances, especially in subjects like mathematics where students were honored with numerous awards. DSSW was the 8th best performing High School in Namibia in 2012, and occupied place 10 in 2013. Grade 7 became part of the Primary School again. School numbers gradually increase to over 760 scholars and more than 35 teachers. In 2007 DSSW also introduced the opening of Projekt Lilie under the motto ‚ÄúDie Zukunft beginnt im Klassenzimmer‚Äù (‚ÄúThe future begins in the classroom‚Äù). Projekt Lilie is an initiative supporting and promoting education in Namibia, with special reference to the maintenance and advancement of the German language and culture.

Sartorius, a man of very traditional convictions, was the leader of a faction of the Moderate Party which, because of his erroneously supposed Polish origin, was known as los polacos (\\"the Poles\\"). His newspaper, El Herlado, became one of the mainstays of the moderates during the regency of the Progressivist Baldomero Espartero. During the Moderate decade (1844-1854), Sartorius held several political offices, especially three times as Ministry of the Interior (Ministro de Gobernacion) in 1847, 1849-1851 and 1853-1854. He became Prime Minister between 1853 and 1854. Family Contrary to popular belief, Sartorius had nothing to do with Poland; he was of German origins.

He was known for his portrayals of horses in action and also for his black-and-white illustrations for the Captain Kettle stories by C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne. Early life right right Wood's Birth Certificate shows that he was born in Christchurch, Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales, on 10 December 1866. His parents were Stanley James Wood (c. 183927 May 1877), a cement manufacturer and entrepreneur, and Charlotte Atkins (c. 1839). Wood's father was declared bankrupt in 1861, and was before the bankruptcy court again in 1869. Wood was the last of five children, and the only boy. In 1873, George Grant, a Scottish silk merchant in London bought some 77 square miles of land in Kansas and proposed to set up an English colony there which he called Victoria. Wood's father sunk his money into the scheme and the family travelled to Kansas in 1873, when Wood was five or six years old. Grant had made him commissioner of streets in Victoria as an inducement. When the family arrived in Victoria they found, not the bustling colony they had been promised, but a single two-storey stone building, the railway station, which also functioned as a hotel. Many of the other colonists were young men who were on allowance from their families, and were more intent on enjoying themselves than farming. The family found the carousing of the young men, and of the local cowboys, was intolerable and fled to Kansas City, with the very last of their money. Wood's father got a job with the Union Pacific land department at Lawrence, Kansas and the family moved and the children attended school there. However, their hardships were not over. Still seeking his fortune, Woods' father left his job in Lawrence and began to travel around Kansas demonstrating a patent well-digging auger. He was demonstrating the auger at a farm near Wichita, Kansas on 27 May 1877, when he experience some symptoms that made him rush to the doctor's office. He died in the doctor's office at 4pm, just as they began to try and treat him. The family's troubles were not over though. They were living in a ranch-house outside the town where the former occupants were buried in the garden after being killed in an Indian raid. The new widow was horrified to find one night that a party of Indians had surrounded the house and she had the children put on boots and clump around and bang doors so that those outside would thing there was a part of cowboys in the house. The family immediately returned to England, although Wood visited Lawrence several times in later life, and his mother visited at least once. The 1881 census found the family at 4 Mornington street, apart from the eldest Amy Phoebe (Oct 1860-1902). Wood's second eldest sister Jessie M. was an artist's apprentice at the time. She later travelled to New York to work for the Redfern fashion house as a designer. Eventually she became the drama critic of the New York Journal at a salary of $250 a week, and illustrated her reviews with her own illustrations. Work The 1891 census found Wood at the same address, but this time all of his sisters had left. He now recorded his profession as artist, but it is not clear what formal training he had had. He was an accomplished artist, having work accepted by the Royal Academy up to 1905, as follows: *1892. 361 Royal Horse Artillery going into action, Afghan Campaign. *1894. 391 A battle incident, horse artillery going in under fire. *1895. 107 Halting the battery, Horse Artillery coming into position. *1897. 1009 A surrender under protest, an incident in the Matabele war. *1903. 574 A bucking broncho, souvenir of Texas. Wood exhibited at least two other works at the Academy as Greenwall states that Wood had seven works exhibited at the Royal Academy of which five had a military theme. Presumably two of these, one military and on non-military were shown after 1905. Kirkpatrick states that Wood's first illustration work was The Tales of The Spanish Boccaccio: Count Lucanor: Or the Fifty Pleasant Stories of Patronio translated by James York from the original by Prince Don Juan Manuel published in 1888 by Pickering & Chatto. The illustration of this book, as on some others he did, was attributed to S. L. Wood, rather than Stanley L. Wood. His next book was The Arabian Nights Entertainments \\"Aldine\\" Edition, from the text Of Dr. Jonathan Scott. This consisted of four large 600 page volumes. It was also published by Pickering & Chatto and cost 24 shillings (one pound and four shillings). The Times said that \\"With one or two possible exceptions, the illustrations are fair in themselves and unimpeachable in treatment\\". Wood's first two books were for Pickering & Chatto which Andrew Chatto (1841‚Äì1913) owned, but Chatto moved the publishing work to Chatto & Windus. Houfe notes that Wood was \\"employed almost continuously by Messrs Chatto's as an illustrator of boys' adventure stories\\". The Illustrated London News sent Wood to South Dakota in 1888 where he was able to build on his juvenile experience of the American Old West way of life and for many years produced work with a cowboy and Indian flavour. Harper's published a number of his illustrations, and his Sketches from an Indian Reservation appeared in the Illustrated London News of 19 January 1889. In 1890 he produced sixty pen and ink illustrations for Bret Harte A Waif of the Plains. His illustrations often appeared in early issues of Pearson's Magazine and covered a wide range of genres; notably, he illustrated George Griffith's Stories of Other Worlds (1900-1901), early science fiction. His many Africana illustrations included those for the books of Bertram Mitford (1855‚Äì1914) - The Gun Runner (1893), The Luck of Gerald Ridgeley (1894), The Curse of Clement Wayneflete (1894), Renshaw Fanning's Quest (1894), The King's Assegai (1894), A Veldt Official (1895) and The Expiation of Wynne Palisser (1896). In 1900, he did 100 illustrations for an American edition of Richard Burton's The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night. Presumably he was awarded this work because of his earlier work on Crellin's Romances of the Old Seraglio. His illustrations of the Anglo-Boer War appeared in Black & White and Black & White Budget. Most of these featured equestrian scenes. Some of these illustrations also appeared in L'Illustr√© Soleil du Dimanche and one appeared as a cover illustration for War Pictures. He worked for War Illustrated during World War I. Examples of book illustration by Wood Marie Connor and her husband Robert Leighton wrote Convict 99. A true story of penal servitude in 1898. Sutherland describes this as: \\"a powerful anti-prison tract which became their best-known work\\". The story was published first as a serial in Answers one of the publications produced by Alfred Harmsworth (18651922), for whom both Connor and Leighton worked. Kemp et al. say that Convict 99 was Connor's greatest success. Wood drew eight illustration of the publication. Those shown below are from the on-line copy at The British Library.

N. Crellin. Romances was a follow-up to Crellin's first book Tales of the Caliph (1887, T Fisher Unwin, London) published under the pseudonym Al Arawiyah, and being nine additional stories set in the world of the Arabian Nights. Although the list of illustrations lists only eight full page plates, the book has nine of them, with A Single Blow of a Trusty Scimitar being a full page plate rather an illustration in the text. The book must have been a success as Chatto and Windus issued a new edition of Tales of the Caliph in 1895. Illustrations by courtesy of the British Library.

Wood died at his home at 23 Windsor Road, Palmers Green, North London on 1 March 1928, having been ill for some time. His estate was valued at ¬£114 15s, a pitiable small amount after so many years of work. He was survived by his wife and three adult sons. Assessment Samuels report that there were no auction records for Wood when their encyclopedia was written, but that the estimated price for a 10x14 inch (25.4x35.6 cm) oil on board showing cowboys spooking a town was about 1,200 to 1,500 USD in 1976. Invaluable give more recent estimates, with a 9.9x5 inch (25.1x12.7 cm) pencil drawing estimated at 2,500 to 4,000 USD in 2017, and a 24.4x16.5 inch (61.9x41.9 c) oil on board painting of a Pony Express estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 USD in 2014. Peppin and Micklethwait say of Wood that: \\"Most of Wood's illustrations are wash drawings; his emphatic tonal contrasts reproduced well in the halftone process and he was noted for his vigorous, dramatic style and for the authenticity of his American 'frontier' backgrounds.\\" Newbolt refers to Wood's illustrations for the works of G. A. Henty being \\"in his characteristic vigorous style\\". Thorpe says that Wood \\"anticipated the 'headlong dash' and wild west thrillers of the modern films\\". Turner characterises him as one of two famous artists associated with the Boy's Own Paper. Cooper notes that Wood is especially noted for his fine action-packed drawings, which certainly helped to bring the printed page alive for boys and girls of the time. The book-dealer and founding member of the Potomac Corral, Jefferson Chenoweth Dykes better known as Jeff Dykes (-1989), wrote in Fifty Great Western Illustrators - \\"No better horse artist ever lived than Stanley L.

He resided at the new capital of Johor at Batu Sawar, but later moved his administration to Pasir Raja around 1609. In 1612, at the instigation of his co-ruler and half-brother Abdullah, better known from period historical documents as Raja Bongsu or Raja Seberang (who after 1613 ruled as Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah) Bendahara Tun Sri Lanang oversaw the editorial and compilation process of Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), the most important Malay literary work of all time. In 1606 Alauddin allied with the Dutch to fight the Portuguese in an attempt to oust them from Melaka in a joint military campaign. To this end he ratified two treaties with the Dutch Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge in May and September 1606. Following a crippling blockade of the Johor River in 1608 and 1609, he signed a peace agreement with the Portuguese in October 1610. His fate and death remain uncertain. Some claim that he fled Batu Sawar at the time of the Acehnese attack in 1613 and died in exile on Lingga while others claim that he had been captured twice by the Acehnese Acehnese between 1613 and 1615 and subsequently sentenced to death around 1615. He is buried in Kota Tinggi, Johor.

The seven-part show is the largest programming event in the ten-year history of the channel and is part of the largest cross- platform initiative since the founding of the National Geographic Society. It was filmed in HD, and premiered on November 7, 2010 with accompanying coverage in the National Geographic magazine and an official companion book. Episodes Great Migrations debuted on November 7, 2010 worldwide. The series airs on the Sundays of the same month, spread across four hour-long chapters, excluding three supplemental hours which run on other dates. The National Geographic Channel estimated that the show's premiere would be accessible in 330 million homes across the globe. Production The production team traveled over two and a half years tracking multiple species ranging from army ants to Mali elephants. Cinematographers went to great lengths to film the species and their migratory habits, although none were hurt in the process. Filming provided rare footage of various animal scenes, including the documentation of an elephant's funeral for the first time outside East Africa. Various technologies were used to film the show, such as the use of high-tech tags on monarch butterflies and elephant seals. The Cineflex Heligimbal gyrostabalized cameras was widely utilized in the production. It allows rock-solid closeups to be shot from a kilometer up, a height that does not disturb the animals being filmed. The series also uses the ultra-slow motion Phantom HD camera by Vision Research and the \\"beyond high-def\\" Red camera. Reception Great Migrations was acclaimed, with considerable praise its cinematography and photography. The Washington Post remarked on the show's \\"compelling grandeur\\"; reviewer Tom Shales noted how contemporary nature films would inevitably be compared with the BBC classics, Planet Earth and Life. Great Migrations, he felt, superseded both in its narration and score.

The Frankfurt-Offenbach local railway () was a former railway in the Frankfurt am Main area, which developed from the state-owned Frankfurt- Offenbach Railway (Frankfurt-Offenbacher Eisenbahn). The line opened in 1848 and was one of the oldest railways in Germany. It was the first railway line between the Frankfurt and the nearby city of Offenbach and operated until 1955. Planning and building  Old Sachsenhausen station in 1864 While the Grand Duchy of Hesse (Hesse-Darmstadt) was developing plans for the construction of the Main-Neckar Railway (connecting Frankfurt and Heidelberg), a local company proposed in the late 1830s to build a line along the south bank of the Main, connecting the line with Offenbach, one of the most important commercial cities of the Grand Duchy. The project failed in 1841 for lack of funds. The Free City of Frankfurt had misgivings about a connection between Darmstadt and Offenbach, but it supported a rail connection between Frankfurt and Offenbach. The Grand Duchy and the Free City of Frankfurt signed an agreement on 12 December 1842 to establish a joint state railway company, known as a condominium railway (Kondominalbahn) and to construct the line. This would connect with the Main-Neckar Railway, construction of which was about to start. The terminus of the line was in Offenbach on a plot of land northwest of the centre of the city at that time. This area was west of Kaiserstra√üe between Domstra√üe and Bahnhofstra√üe (streets). The station‚Äîlater called Lokalbahnhof‚Äîwas built on the eastern edge of Sachsenhausen between Darmst√§dter Landstra√üe, Heisterstra√üe and Dreieichstra√üe and was originally called Sachsenhausen station, later Old Sachsenhausen station. Stations were also built north of Oberrad and at the current street of Wasserhofstra√üe. Operations  Offenbacher Lokalbahn station Difficulties in acquiring land north of Oberrad and the opposition of carters in Frankfurt delayed the start of operations. The originally planned commencement of services on 1 August 1846, simultaneously with the opening of the Main-Neckar railway, was not achieved. Services also did not start on 1 August 1847, despite the completion of railway facilities. Instead, freight trains ran only three times a week at night from 23 August, operating in what had been declared publicly as a trial. Since the first Main-Neckar Railway bridge over the Main had not yet been completed, trains could not reach the Main-Neckar station on the north bank of the Main. Therefore, trains ran from Darmstadt to an operations depot called Mainspitze on the edge of the Main, where they reversed to run back to Sachsenhausen station, which had been rented as a temporary terminus from the Frankfurt-Offenbach Railway. The Main-Neckar Railway wanted sole use of the Sachsenhausen station and was not interested in joint operations with the Frankfurt-Offenbach Railway, creating further delays. Another reason for the delay was that the Frankfurt-Offenbach Railway had leased its two locomotives to the Main-Neckar Railway, which used them on the Mannheim‚ÄìFriedrichsfeld line. The company used a Main-Neckar Railway locomotive to haul its night freight trains to and from Offenbach. The people of Offenbach demanded that passenger service operation commence during the March Revolution of 1848. On 8 March, a crowd assembled in the station area and demanded to be taken to Sachsenhausen and on to Darmstadt. There they wanted to hold a demonstration to put pressure on the government and parliament. The railway staff accepted the demand and made a passenger train ready. The management of the Frankfurt- Offenbach Railway gave in to public pressure and provided a regular passenger service. Since both of its rented locomotives were still needed, it temporarily hired two engines and staff from the Main-Neckar Railway, prior to the return of its own engines from Mannheim. From 9 March 1848 four pairs of trains ran each day between Offenbach and Sachsenhausen according to a temporary timetable. Official services started on 16 April 1848 with ten pairs of trains operating each day, with eleven trains in both directions on Sundays and public holidays. On 15 November 1848 the Main-Neckar Bridge and the associated north bank station of the Main-Neckar Railway opened in Frankfurt. The Frankfurt-Offenbach Railway now had sole operating rights in Sachsenhausen station. Through trains to Frankfurt Main-Neckar station were planned, but only operated from 18 October 1849 because of a dispute over track charges. Some trains still terminated in Sachsenhausen due to lack of demand. According to the timetable of 1865, eight trains ran daily from Offenbach to Frankfurt; only five stopped short at Sachsenhausen. Further developments Frankfurt Lokalbahn station in 1900 With the annexation of Frankfurt by Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Frankfurt's share of the Frankfurt-Offenbach Railway was taken over by Prussia. On 31 December 1871, Prussia became a party to the treaty with Hesse-Darmstadt, retrospectively to 12 June 1868, and it became part of the Prussian State Railways. The construction of the Frankfurt‚ÄìBebra railway from Hanau to Frankfurt via Offenbach significantly increased the importance of the line. On 16 November 1873, a new line was opened from the existing line of the former Frankfurt-Offenbach Railway in Oberrad to connect the line to the Main-Neckar Railway station in Frankfurt. As early as 1874 two more tracks were laid in order to cope with the increased traffic. On 2 December 1875, Bebra Station in Frankfurt (now called South station) was finally opened southwest of the old Sachsenhausen station. At the same time the previous connection to the Main-Neckar bridge was abandoned and removed. The former Frankfurt-Offenbach Railway line became the Lokalbahn (Local Railway) and now operated only as a shuttle service between Offenbach and Frankfurt Localbahn station (Lokalbahnhof), as it was now renamed. In 1881 Frankfurt Lokalbahn station was connected to the network of the Frankfurter Trambahn-Gesellschaft, the Frankfurt tram company. From 1884 the Lokalbahn was affected seriously by competition from the Frankfurt-Offenbach Tramway Company (Frankfurt-Offenbacher Trambahn-Gesellschaft, FOTG), the first electric tramway in Germany and the fourth in the world. Although the Lokalbahn offered lower fares and faster journey times, the tram ran to the centre of Offenbach and Oberrad. Patronage on the Lokalbahn fell from 1,601,826 in 1883 to 1,405,519 persons in 1884, while the FOTG had 440,000 passengers in its first year. The Frankfurt Forest Railway (Frankfurter Waldbahn), a steam tramway, had used the Lokalbahnhof as its terminus since 6 February 1889. From 1885, the Lokalbahn carried a significant volume of goods for the first time: the Sachsenhausen slaughterhouse was connected by a siding to Frankfurt Lokalbahn station and had its own \\"cattle yard\\" station, which handled cattle shipments. In 1900, however, the siding was replaced with a branch off the Bebra Railway at Oberrad, ending the transport of goods on the Lokalbahn. A serious decline in the number of passengers came in 1906 with the integration of the former FOTG line to Offenbach into the Frankfurt tram network, allowing a direct service from Offenbach to central Frankfurt. As a consequence, the number of passengers on the Lokalbahn was reduced by a quarter, while the aging infrastructure of the railway had an increasing impact on costs. The line made its first major losses, so the Prussian State Railways contemplating a sale of the line to the cities of Frankfurt and Offenbach. These were planning the electrification and modernisation of the line and a connection to Frankfurt South or Hauptbahnhof. At times, the conversion of the line into an electric underground railway was planned according to the Berlin model. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914, however, prevented the implementation of these plans. In the summer 1914 timetable, trains ran from Frankfurt to Offenbach at twenty-minute intervals from 5.40 to midnight. Like the Wars of 1866 and 1870/71, the First World War also affected operation of the Lokalbahn considerably. Passenger numbers halved and coal and spare parts shortage repeatedly closed the line. The timetable was thinned until 1918, when it was completely closed. In 1920, Monday to Saturday trains recommenced at 40-minute intervals. After an attempt to close the line in 1921, which was abandoned after protests from local residents, operations were limited from 1925 to 6 to 9 AM and 4 to 8 PM on Monday to Saturday and 1 to 8 PM on Sundays and public holidays. Luggage and parcel services were abandoned and staff reduced to a minimum. The Second World War affected rail service only slightly at first. Early in 1942 the schedule was temporarily reduced to hourly operations, but in November the same year trains were running every half-hour. In January and March 1944, allied bombing raids at times disrupted the track and destroyed the station building in Frankfurt, but operations resumed after a few days each time. The war finally closed operations on 28 August 1944. Damage to the Lokalbahn was repaired and the line was put back into operation on 2 December 1946. A four-axle diesel engine of class VT 60.5 was used to haul services instead of the steam trains formerly used. Services ran every half-hour from the 1947/48 winter timetable. Closure  Some time after the currency reform of 1948, increasing motorisation and an improved rail service on the Bebra line led to the number of passengers quickly falling to about 1000 per day. Deutsche Bundesbahn (German Federal Railways) therefore decided to close the now highly unprofitable line on 1 October 1955. During the last three days of operations, travel on the trains was free. With the exception of Oberrad station, all rail track was isolated and building abandoned on the Lokalbahn in the summer of 1956. A new tram station and an office building were built on the site of Frankfurt Lokalbahn station in 1970. In 1990, an S-Bahn station of the same name opened south of the former Lokalbahn station. Parts of the former Lokalbahn line were used in 1989 for the construction of the S-Bahn line to Offenbach am Main, which went into operation in 1995. In Offenbach, the Offenbach City Tunnel runs below the route of the former Lokalbahn line.

He inherited a large number of mayorazgos including Bulilla, Hoya Ubaca and Hoya Hermosa. The origins of Joaqu√≠n's family go back to the thirteenth century, when they are documented as an old noble Aragonese family which settled in the new areas conquered by King James I of Aragon as a result of their economic support in the military campaigns in the Kingdom of Valencia, as well as having participated in the reconquest of the Kingdom of Murcia by King Alfonso X between 1242 and 1243. From their involvement in these campaigns the family received large estates in the area surrounding Villena. Ever since the family actively took part in the politics of the region, protecting the city of Villena in favour of the Catholic Monarchs against the Pachecos, as well as serving to King Philip II in the defence of Malta and King Philip IV. Joaqu√≠n Maria studied Philosophy en the School of San Fulgencia de Murcia between 1811 and 1814, and law in the University of Orihuela, where he gained a Bachiller en Leyes in 1818 and a Licenciatura in 1821. While completing his studies he became chair of Moral Philosophy and Natural and Roman Law. Once the Trienio Liberal finished he went into exile to Montpellier escaping from Absolutism repression. In Montepellier he studied Sciences and Medicine. He began his political career as S√≠ndico Personero in the Alicante's municipal government in 1833. In 1834 he became member of parliament for the province of Alicante. He then was Minister of Gobernaci√≥n during Jos√© Mar√≠a Calatrava's presidency, Mayor of Madrid in 1840 and President of Spain in two occasions. One of the most important events during his presidency was the decision of declaring Queen Elisabeth II full-age and capable of reigning. Shortly after he left politics only to return briefly between 1849 and 1853 to become Senator and Special Minister of the War Tribunal and Navy. He was a prominent member of the Progressive Party and was praised by his oratory and eloquent skills. He was a strong advocate for the role of women, the abolition of mayorazgos, the reformation of education and the instauration of universal democracy and rejected several times honours such as marquisates and honoroury salaries.

It continues to serve as a community resource. Description and history The Simsbury Townhouse is located near the southern end of Simsbury's downtown area, just north of the First Church of Christ on the west side of Hopmeadow Street. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clabpoarded exterior. Its front facade is dominated by a projecting Greek temple portico, with fluted columns supporting an entablature and fully pedimented gable. The front facade sheltered by this portico is finished in flushboarding, and has a pair of symmetrically placed entrances. The interior consists of a large chamber with a stage at the far end. The walls have horizontally laid wainscoting to a height of four feet, and are plastered above. The ceiling is finished in wooden beadboard. Until the early 19th century, Simsbury's town meetings were held in the local Congregational church. When the congregation built a new church in 1833, it voted to disallow use of the space for town meetings, bringing about the need for a town hall. Town meetings were held in a variety of other spaces until this structure was built in 1839. It was originally located at the top of the hill near its present location, and was moved twice, once in 1843, and finally in 1869 to its present site. Although it was not formally referred to as such until 1882, it served from its construction until 1931 as town hall, when they moved to the new Eno Memorial Hall. It was adapted for other recreational uses by the early 20th century, and was rented to the local Boy Scout organization in 1934. and It continues to be owned by the town today, and is available for rent.

The entry opens to the courtyard, which is a garden space with a small pool, and then into a narrow hall from which the rest of the house is gradually revealed. The living room and dining room are sited to provide maximum exposure to the views. Aubrey Watzek was a lumber magnate, who commissioned John Yeon, then a young architect, to design a house for himself and his mother. Yeon completed the design in 1936, but Watzek initially rejected it. After working for a time with another architect at A.E. Davis, he accepted Yeon's design. The house was completed in 1937. Watzek lived in the house until his death in 1971. The house received immediate notice after its construction, and was included in an architectural exhibition organized by the Museum of Modern Art. Yeon purchased the house after Watzek's death, and it was subsequently taken over by the University of Oregon. It is open for group tours, day meetings, and other special events.

Like stagecoaches they made long scheduled trips using stage stations or posts where the horses would be replaced by fresh horses. Stage wagons were intended for use in particularly difficult conditions where standard stagecoaches would be too big and too heavy. This style of vehicle was often called a mud-coach or mud-wagon. More like wagons than coaches, the sides of the vehicle gave passengers little protection from the dirt of the road. Abbot, Downing named theirs an overland wagon. A brand- name, Celerity, later became popular in place of mud (wagon).Ken Wheeling, They Called Them Mudders. The Carriage Journal, Vol 43 No 5 October 2005 Use They were employed wherever the poor state of the roads and or demand for services did not warrant the expense of a stagecoach. Most stagecoach routes in the United States' West were opened with them and often operators continued to use these vehicles as stagecoaches. Structure Mud-wagon They were not unlike a freight wagon with a high driver's seat, bench seats on the tray, and posts holding up canvas to shelter passengers from the weather. Those stage wagons with throroughbraces had an undercarriage like those used by a Concord coach but the thoroughbraces were much shorter and mounted to make sure there was much less motion of the body. The thoroughbraces were brought over a bar at each end and attached to another bar above the outer side of each axle. Stage wagon wheels and their iron tires were as much as fifty per cent wider than those of conventional stagecoaches Development Trade card of R Hammond of Tenterden, 1750. Freight 65 miles to Southwark at the south end of London Bridge from Tenterden in the Kentish Weald and return, once each week Wagons carrying freight had been taking passengers in Europe since 1500. This particular stage wagon type was first recorded near the end of the 18th century in use in eastern North America, US and Upper and Lower Canada. It was an unsprung wagon with the driver's bench seat providing room for two more passengers beside him. It might also carry more passenger seats on the tray behind. These extra seats were reached by climbing over the driver's seat. About this time, the Postmaster General Joseph Habersham required the driver's seat to be moved from the tray onto a front wall to improve the driver's vision and by dropping the tray improve the wagon's stability. This created the characteristic stagecoach-like profile of the stage wagon. Their relatively simple design and construction allowed them to be sold by Abbot, Downing at around half the price of full-size Concord coaches. Their suspension employed thoroughbraces that were much shorter than those used on Concord stagecoaches. Some manufacturers Abbot, Downing's Overland Wagon a canvas-topped stage wagon 1871available in two sizes, 6 or 9 passengers and available with: doors, painted sail duck top, sail duck or enameled curtains, lined in leather, back boot, driver's apron.

The company was founded as a spin-off from Elron Electronic Industries and Elbit, to develop and manufacture diagnostic systems and medical imaging devices; in 1999 Elbit Medical Imaging was sold to Europe- Israel Ltd., a company controlled by businessman Mordechai (Moti) Zisser, who turned it into a diversified holding company. History The origins of Elbit Medical Imaging can be traced to 1990, when Elbit's medical arm, at the time a subsidiary of Elron, acquired a majority share in Elscint. Elscint was a company founded in 1969, which developed medical imaging equipment such as MRI and CT scanners. In 1996, Elbit was spun off into three independent companies, and Elbit Medical Imaging was created as separate NASDAQ listed company (ticker symbol:EMITF). During 1999 and 2000Elscint and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to GE Healthcare and to Picker (now Philips Medical Systems) for approximately $600 million. In 1999 Elron Electronic Industries sold all its holdings in Elbit Medical Imaging to Europe Israel Ltd., formerly an Israeli company listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange and controlled by real estate developer Mordechai (Moti) Zisser, for a sum of approximately $127.8 million. Following the acquisition in May 1999, Zisser integrated his existing real estate activities into the company and restructured Elbit Medical Imaging as a holding company, focusing on: real estate and hotels development, shopping and entertainment malls, industrial manufacturing and supply of components for the medical imaging; and venture capital investments in high-technology and bio-technology companies. In 2005 Elscint, which was the first Israeli company to be listed on NASDAQ in 1972, was delisted and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Medical Imaging. At that time, Elscint was no longer engaged in its original medical imaging equipment activities. On November 1, 2006, Plaza Centers N.V., an indirect subsidiary of Elbit Imaging, was listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company raised approximately ¬£166 million of gross proceeds and its shares are traded under the ticker \\"PLAZ\\".

Written by Willie Dixon, the song was one of Diddley's last record chart hits. Unlike many of his well-known songs, \\"You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover\\" does not rely on the Bo Diddley beat. A variety of rock and other performers have recorded renditions of the song. Original song \\"You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover\\" is based on a sixteen-bar blues structure that \\"boasts a beat that's utterly compulsive and primordial, but closer to a way- speeded up walking rhythm than to the standard Diddley pattern\\". Willie Dixon's lyrics use \\"a series of metaphors of all sorts of things you can't judge by their appearances before landing on the title phrase\\". In his autobiography, Dixon explained that the lyrics were \\"his [Bo Diddley's] bag 100%... and when I told him about it, he like it immediately\\". Diddley's original recording breaks the fourth wall by encouraging the listener to turn his or her radio up after the first verse. In 1962, the song reached number 21 on the Billboard magazine R&B; chart and number 48 on the Billboard Hot 100. Early cover versions \\"You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover\\" has been recorded by a variety of artists, often with variations in the title, such as \\"You Can't Judge a Book by Its Cover\\" or \\"You Can't Judge a Book by Looking at the Cover\\". An early lineup of the Rolling Stones made a demo recording of the song in October 1962. In 1963, the Yardbirds with Eric Clapton recorded a live version of the song at the Crawdaddy Club in London during the sessions that produced the Sonny Boy Williamson and The Yardbirds album. In 1964, the song was performed on Germany's Beat-Club television program by the Syndicats, featuring guitarist Steve Howe. In 1966, folk singer Tom Rush recorded it for the album Take a Little Walk with Me. Also in 1966, garage band Shadows of Knight released their first album \\"Gloria\\" which included their own version. The Monkees recorded it their Live 1967 album with lead vocals by Mike Nesmith.

On January 26, 1972, Jerry Garcia and Howard Wales performed an up-tempo version of the song in closing a concert set at Symphony Hall, Boston.

History  Before he became sultan of Johor, Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah was also known as Raja Bongsu, Raja Seberang or Raja di Ilir. According to the testimony of Dutch Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge Raja Bongsu was one of four surviving sons of Raja Ali bin Abdul Jalil (alias Raja Omar) of Johor. The other remaining male (half-) siblings were described by Admiral Matelief as Raja Siak, Raja Laut, and Alauddin Riayat Shah III.Borschberg, Hugo Grotius, the Portuguese and Free Trade in the East Indies, appendix 13, pp. 211‚Äì215. The latter ruled as the 6th sultan of Johor between the death of his father Raja Ali Jalla in 1597 and the Acehnese attack on Johor in 1613. In 1603 Raja Bongsu was instrumental in forging the early diplomatic relations with the Dutch by lending assistance to Admiral Jacob van Heemskerk on 25 February 1603 in attacking and plundering the Portuguese carrack, the Santa Catarina, in the Johor River estuary off present-day Singapore.Borschberg, Hugo Grotius, the Portuguese, pp. 42‚Äì47. He was also responsible for sending one of the first diplomatic missions of a Malay ruler to the Dutch Republic in the same year. Headed by Megat Mansur, the Johor embassy sailed to Europe on the ships of Admiral van Heemskerk in 1603. Megat Mansur did not survive the voyage, but other members of the Johor embassy did and returned with the fleet under the command of Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge in 1606.Borschberg, Hugo Grotius, the Portuguese p. 364 note 71. In that year, Raja Bongsu formally ratified two treaties with the Dutch (dated 17 May and 23 September 1606) and signed himself as the co-ruler of Johor.Borschberg, Hugo Grotius, the Portuguese appendix 14, pp. 215‚Äì223. He also lent active assistance to Admiral Matelief during his seaborne attack on Portuguese Melaka in or around May 1606. In early 1609 Raja Bongsu received Dutch Admiral Pieter Willemsz. Verhoeff at Batu Sawar. On this occasion one of the German officers serving in Verhoeff's fleet, one Johann Verken, described the physical appearance of Raja Bongsu. He wrote that the Raja was \\"a young man in his 30s ... In his appearance and body a well-proportioned person, rather tall, articulate, and fair-skinned both on his body and on his face.\\" Borschberg, Hugo Grotius, the Portuguese, appendix 16, pp. 258‚Äì259. After the Portuguese had imposed an economically crippling blockade on the Johor River for much of the year 1609, Raja Bongsu was necessitated (through the machinations of his half-brother Raja Siak) to sign a peace treaty with the Portuguese Melaka in October 1610. Described as his personal \\"fiefdom\\" by Admiral Matelieff, Raja Bongsu controlled the settlement of Kota Seberang which was located almost straight across the Johor River from the royal administrative center and capital Batu Sawar. He is also said to have controlled areas around the Sambas River on the island of Borneo. In 1613, Raja Bongsu was one of the prisoners taken back to Aceh after the invasion of Johor by sultan Iskandar Muda. He was married to one of Iskandar's sisters, and returned to Johor as the new sultan. Raja Bongsu was subsequently enthroned as Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah of Johor. His half- brother Alauddin Riayat Shah III who had fallen from power at the time of Iskandar Muda's offensive on Johor in 1613 had fled to Lingga and probably died there in or around 1615. In 1618, Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah moved to Lingga and gained the support of Orang Laut and the Dutch to wage a war against Aceh. He later divorced his wife who was also a sister of Iskandar Muda, a move that further angered the sultan. He spent most of his reign as a wanderer, pursued from town to town and island to island by the Acehnese. He died at Tambelan archipelago in March 1623.

Indian Express reported presence of about 18,000 Afghan refugees in India in 2011, citing the foreign ministry. Apart from citizens and expatriates, there are many communities in India who trace their ancestries back to Pashtun forefathers. History The earliest record of Afghans in India (people from modern-day Afghanistan; they should not be confused with the ethnic Pashtun people from Afghanistan who were historically called Afghan) are the rulers from (present-day) Afghanistan who began setting up dynasties in Northern India around 10 century onwards, until the Mughal's arrival in India. These dynasties include Ghaznavids (Turkic origin rulers from Ghazni in modern-day Afghanistan), Ghorids (an Afghan origin rulers from Ghor in present-day central Afghanistan), Khilji dynasty (a Turco-Afghan origin dynasty from eastern and southern Afghanistan), and Lodhi dynasty. Mughal rule was briefly interrupted by the Sur dynasty before Mughals regained the power. Other Pashtuns began invading India until the Sikh Empire came to power. This formed a barrier between Afghanistan (Durrani Empire) and British India. Afghans were required visas to enter India after this period. The great Pashtun emperor Sher Shah Suri (Farid Khan) defeated the Mughal Empire in 1540. After his accidental death in 1545, his son Islam Shah became his successor. He first served as a private before rising to become a commander in the Mughal army under Babur and then as the governor of Bihar. In 1537, when Babur's son Humayun was elsewhere on an expedition, Sher Shah overran the state of Bengal and established the Sur Dynasty. A brilliant strategist, Sher Shah proved himself a gifted administrator as well as a capable general. His reorganization of the empire laid the foundations for the later Mughal emperors, notably Akbar, son of Humayun. He extended the Grand Trunk Road from Chittagong in the frontiers of the province of Bengal in near eastern India to Kabul in Afghanistan in the far northwest of the country. During the 19th century many Afghans migrated to India. Prominent among them were the families of Nawab of SardhanaPage 13: The Golden Book of India, by Sir Roper Lethbridge. McMillan & Co., 1893, London. and the Qizilbashi Agha family of Srinagar, Kashmir. Both the families had martial lineage and belonged to the feudal aristocracy. During the 20th century, a small number of Indians of Afghan heritage became involved in Bollywood film making industry. This includes, Dilip Kumar, Feroz Khan, Kader Khan, Salman Khan , Shah Rukh Khan and others. After the start of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War in 1979, a number of Afghans immigrated to India. Most of them were Hindu and Sikh Afghans who are neither native Tajiks nor Pashtuns from Afghanistan. Thousands of Afghan refugees that have been living in India have since become Indian citizens.UNHCR2013 UNHCR regional operations profile - South Asia Recently, Adnan Sami became an Indian citizen on 1 January 2016. He is a Pashtun from his father Arshad Sami Khan's side. Adnan's grandfather General Mehfooz Jan hailed from Herat, Afghanistan and was the governor of four provinces in Afghanistan, namely Herat, Kabul, Jalalabad and Balkh, under the reign of King Amanullah Khan. Adnan's great-grandfather General Ahmed Jan was the military adviser to King Abdur Rahman Khan. General Ahmed Jan was the conqueror of Kafiristan and named it Nuristan. However, at the time of the Habibullah Kalakani revolution in Afghanistan, Adnan's grandfather General Mehfooz Jan was assassinated. The family therefore migrated to Peshawar, which was a part of British India at that time.  Stay  India has not signed the 1951 Convention relating to refugees, nor does it have any domestic legislation in place to ensure their basic rights. Many Afghans don't have work permits in India, have trouble enrolling their children in school, and can't even get a local phone. They carry blue United Nations refugee cards, and do little more than just survive. Afghans make less than their Indian counter parts. = Naturalisation = To be eligible for naturalisation, a refugee must have lived in India for 12 years or have been married to an Indian for seven years. The length of stay must be supported by documentation - a Residence Permit issued by the Indian government - for it to count towards naturalisation. UNHCR reported, as of 2005, only 10 cases of naturalisation had reached the last stage of the naturalisation process at the Ministry of Home Affairs of India.  Pashto-speaking Communities of India  Four big state of India there large number of Pashtun Culture 1) Madhya Pradesh (Bhopal and Indore) 2) Punjab (Maler Kotla and Mianwali). 3) Bihar (Gaya, Sherghati, Patna, Aurangabad and Sasaram) 4) Uttar Pradesh (Malihabad, Etawah, Shahjahanpur, Rampur) There are a large number of Pashto-speaking Pakhtuns in the Indian states of Assam and West Bengal and the territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Although their exact numbers are hard to determine, it is at least in excess of 100,000 for it is known that in 1954 over 100,000 nomadic Pakhtuns living in Kashmir Valley were granted Indian citizenship. Today jirgas are frequently held. Those settled and living in the Kashmir Valley speak Pashto, and are found chiefly in the southwest of the valley, where Pashtun colonies have from time to time been founded. The most interesting are the Kukikhel Afridis of Dramghaihama, who retain all the old customs and speak Pashto. They wear colorful dress and carry swords and shields. The Afridis and the Machipurians, who belong to the Yusufzai tribe, are liable to military service, in return for which they hold certain villages free of revenue. The Pashtuns chiefly came in under the Durranis, but many were brought by Maharajah Gulab Singh for service on the frontier. Pashto is also spoken in two villages, Dhakki and Changnar (Chaknot), located on the Line of Control in Kupwara District. In response to demand by the Pashtun community living in the state, Kashir TV has recently launched a series of Pushto-language programs.http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20001207/j&k.htm; See also *Afghan diaspora *Pathans in India *Pashtun diaspora * Afghanistan-India relations * Indians in Afghanistan * UNHCR India References Further reading * India Ethnic groups in India Immigration to India Pashtun diaspora ","title":"Afghans in India"},{"id":"29080897","text":"Hong Song-Dam (born 1955) is a South Korean artist who works with woodcuts.

Early life Mon was born in Oviedo and was the eldest son of Miguel Mon y Miranda and Francisca Men√©ndez y de la Torre. His only sister, Manuela, was married to the Asturian Pedro Jos√© Pidal, 1st Marquis of Pidal, another prominent politician who served several times as prime minister. He studied law in the University of Oviedo, where he became interested in politics and approached the Moderate Party. Political career In the regency of Queen Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies (1833‚Äì1840), Mon was appointed for his first high political office, minister of finance from 1837 to 1838, in a moderate cabinet headed by Narciso Fern√°ndez de Heredia, 2nd Count of Heredia- Sp√≠nola. During the regency of the progressivist Baldomero Espartero (1840‚Äì1843), he was in none of the cabinets but remained active in political life. When the moderates came back to power in 1844, a period started known as the Moderate Decade, Mon was called by the new prime minister, Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Narv√°ez, 1st Duke of Valencia, again as minister of finance. He held this post from 1844 to 1845 and carried out the tax reform of 1845, which established the basis of the current tax system of Spain. It was executed in collaboration with Ram√≥n de Santill√°n, and it is popularly known as the Mon-Santill√°n reform. After the downfall of the moderates, the unionist Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan, offered him several ministerial portfolios, which he always declined. Mon preferred to be in posts away from the first line of political life, such as ambassador to the Holy See or to France. However, he returned to active politics in 1864, when he replaced Lorenzo Arrazola y Garc√≠a as prime minister, but his cabinet lasted only nine months because of the social and political instability. Five years later, the Spanish Glorious Revolution took place. Retirement Mon lived long enough to see the reign of Amadeo I of Spain, the First Spanish Republic and finally the Restoration of King Alfonso XII, which he supported as a personal friend of Antonio C√°novas del Castillo. However, he was not active politically during the Restoration but kept only the honorary post of life senator. He retired to his home town, Oviedo, where he died in 1882.

War and political uncertainty in Spain forced the Fuertes family to seek political asylum in France. While in France his father met Pablo Picasso who, at that time, was involved with a group that helped Spanish artists and intellectuals adjust to life in exile. Fuertes' father began to frequent symposiums attended by Picasso and they quickly formed a friendship which would last for life.\\"Pretoria News, Pretoria, South Africa: Gift to Museum, author: Alice Coetzee, page 3, January 14, 1985\\" Fuertes' first exhibition was at the age of 15 at the Young European Painters Exhibition in Berlin, which awarded him the second place prize. Early influences His first contact with the Surrealist world was made through Salvador Dal√≠, who introduced him to Andr√© Breton, the father of the Surrealist movement. However, Fuertes was receptive to other trends, movements, and quests, which attracted the attention of Pablo Picasso. The two developed an assiduous relationship, thus permitting Fuertes to research the roots of Cubism. This led him to paint his first neo-cubist canvas. In 1957, he exhibited with Salvador Dal√≠, Joan Mir√≥, Antoni T√†pies, and Pablo Picasso at the Bruxelles International Expo, Spanish Pavilion. In 1963, Fuertes left for Rome, where he won the first place prize for his painting Torneo Medieval, awarded by the Grand Prix de Rome for Painting and Sculpture. It was in Italy that he developed a friendship with Giorgio de Chirico, the master painter of metaphysical art, with whom, in 1965, he exhibited his work alongside notable constructivists and surrealists such as Balthus, Umberto Boccioni and Carlo Carra. Upon his return to Paris, Fuertes met Alechinsky. He would also meet regularly with Apel and other artists at the La Coupole Caf√© on the Boulevard du Montparnasse. It was at these meetings that Fuertes began his friendship with the abstract painter, Viola. In 1967, Dal√≠ presented a Fuertes' exhibition at the Gr√©vin Museum in Paris and, in the two years that followed, Fuertes exhibited along with Salvador Dal√≠, Ren√© Magritte, Francis Picabia, Paul Delvaux, F√©lix Labisse, Man Ray, Max Ernst, and others. After that, his paintings were extensively exhibited around Europe and in the United States. Later life In 1979, Fuertes moved to S√£o Paulo, Brazil, where he developed some coloring expressions -- a true representation of one of the first forms of \\"tropical neo-cubism\\".

Biography  Julio Rey Pastor studied high school in his hometown, and began his studies in Sciences in Vitoria. He moved to the University of Saragossa, where he found a stimulating environment in mathematics. Zoel Garc√≠a de Galdeano, Professor of Analytical Geometry and Calculus, was the professor who most influenced Rey Pastor‚Äôs scientific work. He graduated with honors in 1908. Rey Pastor earned his doctorate from Complutense University of Madrid in 1909, under supervision of Eduardo Torroja Caball√©. Between 1911 and 1914, he studied at the University of Berlin and the University of G√∂ttingen, under the supervision of Felix Klein. During that period, he also studied under the supervision of Professors Hermann Schwarz, Friedrich Hermann Schottky (father of Walter Schottky, Nobel Prize in Physics in 1911), and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius.Link to the Spanish Council of Scientific Research (CSIC): http://www.residencia.csic.es/jae/en/protagonistas/41_c.htm His report sent to the Junta para Ampliaci√≥n de Estudios (JAE) allows us to assess the significance of his studies in Germany. He especially liked Schwarz‚Äôs lectures on analytic functions and synthetic geometry, not only because of their innovations but also because Schwarz‚Äôs teaching method. In this report, Rey proposed the creation of a \\"seminar in mathematics to arouse the research spirit of our school children.\\" His proposal was accepted and in 1915 the JAE created the Mathematics Laboratory and Seminar, an important institution for the development of research on this field in Spain. :From 1915, Julio Rey Pastor became a dominant figure in mathematics in Spain, and later Argentina. In that year the Junta created for him in Madrid the first mathematics research institute in Spain which was outside a university. There he started a research seminar, and contributed to the advance and modernization of mathematics research and teaching. He was also the author of a series of advanced mathematics textbooks which had a very considerable influence in the Iberian world‚Ä¶.E.L. Ortiz (1994) \\"Spain, Portugal and Ibero-America, 1780 ‚Äî 1930\\", in Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences, volume 2, page 1509, Ivor Grattan-Guinness editor, Routledge Undoubtedly, the creation of the laboratory was a result of Rey Pastor‚Äôs studies in Germany, and it was intended to overcome the isolation and individualism of the Spanish mathematicians. This laboratory, under the National Institute of Sciences, was first installed in the basement of the National Library, then moved to a modest apartment on Santa Teresa St., then to the building of the Center for Historical Studies and, finally, became part of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas (CSIC), renamed Instituto Jorge Juan de Matem√°ticas in 1939. Rey Pastor‚Äôs scientific work involved research, textbooks, and articles for the general public. They reflected the changes that were taking place in mathematics. He was also interested in the history of science and, specifically, mathematics in Spain. :From 1921 Rey Pastor settled permanently in Argentina...His influence in Argentina was as important as it had been in Spain...In the mid-1930s he directed a substantial group of research students in Buenos Aires. His continued interest in the mathematics life of Spain created two parallel schools, on both sides of the Atlantic, working on similar research projects. In 1951, he was appointed director of the Instituto Jorge Juan de Matem√°ticas in the CSIC. His plans in Spain included two projects: the creation, within the CSIC, of an Institute of Applied Mathematics, and the foundation of a Seminar on the History of Science at the university. In 1954, he entered the Royal Spanish Academy, proposed by Gregorio Mara√±√≥n, and Francisco Javier S√°nchez Cant√≥n, and delivered an acceptance speech on the algebra of language.

Serving with RAF Fighter Command, he rose to command a fighter wing before being shot down and killed on 27 August 1943. French Air Force Born into a wealthy family on 21 August 1914 in Paris, Mouchotte began his military service in October 1935 with the French Air Force at Istres, where he was promoted to corporal (April 1936), master corporal (March 1937), and sergeant (April 1937); he qualified as a pilot in February 1937. In January 1939, he transferred to the reserve and resumed civilian life. Recalled in September 1939, he was posted to training establishments at Salon-de-Provence and Avord as a flying instructor. Despite several requests to join a fighter squadron, he was transferred to Oran in May 1940 for a conversion course to twin-engined aircraft. After the Armistice, the pilots on the base were ordered not to escape to join the Free French and the aircraft were placed under armed guard. Despite this, Mouchotte and five comrades (including Henry Lafont) escaped in a twin-engined Caudron Go√©land aircraft, only to find that the controls for the variable-pitch propellers had been disabled, making the take-off hazardous.Bennet, GH (2011), The RAF's French Foreign Legion: De Gaulle, the British and the Re-emergence of French Air Power 1940-45, Continuum International Publishing Group, (pp. 24-25) However they did manage to land in Gibraltar and later transferred to the Free French armed trawler, Pr√©sident Houduce and sailed to England. In Britain Hurricanes of 615 Squadron land at RAF Northolt in November 1940 After arriving in Britain Mouchotte trained at RAF Old Sarum and RAF Sutton Bridge on Hawker Hurricanes, before being posted to No. 615 Squadron RAF at RAF Northolt in northwest London. He carried out his first operational sortie on 11 October 1940. The squadron moved to RAF Kenley in December 1940 and in August 1941 Mouchotte participated in the shooting-down of a Junkers 88. In November 1941 he transferred to RAF Turnhouse, where the Free French No. 340 Squadron RAF was training on Spitfires; he became a flight commander in February 1942 and subsequently squadron commander of No. 65 Squadron RAF, the first RAF squadron to be commanded by a non-Commonwealth officer. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 1 September 1942. Mouchotte's tomb at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris Finally, he took command of No. 341 Squadron RAF (Groupe de Chasse n¬∞ 3/2 \\"Alsace\\") with the Biggin Hill Wing. On 15 May 1943, S/L 'Jack' Charles (611 squadron) and Mouchotte both destroyed an Fw 190 of I./JG 2, as the Biggin Hill Wing's 999th and 1,000th kill claim.Shores, Christopher (2004), Those Other Eagles: A Tribute to the British, Commonwealth and Free European Fighter Pilots Who Claimed Between Two and Four Victories in Aerial Combat,1939 - 1982, Grub Street Books, (p. 423) He was shot down and killed in combat with Fw 190s of JG 2 during Ramrod S.8, escorting Flying Fortresses on the first daylight raid to Blockhaus d'√âperlecques in the Pas de Calais on 27 August 1943. After take off at 18.02 hours No. 341 squadron flew with bombers to a point 5 miles N.W. of Saint-Pol- sur-Mer where the whole formation turned to port on a direct course for the target. Halfway between Saint-Pol and Saint-Omer the Fortresses were attacked by several formations of Fw 190s diving out of the sun. Breaking to meet these attacks which were coming mostly from behind, the squadron became split up and a general melee followed which lasted for about 15-17 minutes. Cmdt. Mouchotte (Red 1) became separated from the squadron and las last heard to say on the R/T:\\"I am alone with the bombers\\". Nothing more was seen or heard after. His body was later washed ashore on 3 September and was buried in Middelkerke, Belgium. After the War in 1949, his body was exhumed, repatriated and buried in the family tomb at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris on 3 November after a memorial service with full military honours conducted at Les Invalides in Paris. In the same combat, 341 Squadron lost also Blue 4 F/Sgt Magnot who was last seen going down with Fw 190 on his tail. He had accumulated some 1,748 flying hours, including 408 operational hours flying 382 war sorties. He had claimed two aircraft destroyed (with a further one \\"shared\\"), one \\"probable\\" and one damaged. Legacy After the war, his diaries and flying logs were compiled into a book by Andre Dezarrois which was published in France in 1949 as \\"Les carnets de Ren√© Mouchotte, 1940-1943\\" and later as \\"Mes carnets : juin 1940-ao√ªt 1943\\". In 1956 it was translated into English by Philip John Stead and published in the United Kingdom under the title The Mouchotte Diaries; by the following year, eight editions had been printed. The book was reissued in France in 2000 and in the UK in 2003.

There are two plaques in his memory at Eperlecques. A French Air Force base at Cambrai-√âpinoy was named Base A√©rienne 103 \\"Commandant Ren√© Mouchotte\\" in his honour. Cambrai Epinoy is no longer an active establishment, so the French Air Force Training Base at Cazaux was named after Commandant Mouchotte in September 2012.

The Jeep Dallas was built on a Renault 4 chassis, shortened by 47 cm and equipped with the engine of the Renault 4 GTL, a 1106 cc 34ch. Its body was designed in the spirit of the Willys MB U.S. military, called \\"Jeep\\", with proportions that were his own. The Dallas was named in December 1981 and was presented at the Salon de l'Automobile Porte de Versailles, 1982. It is marketed mainly in two-wheel drive (front); a 4x4 model (with SINPAR transmission) is also in the catalog. Jeep dallas In 1983, Jean-Fran√ßois Grandin, alias Frank Alamo, purchased the factory, and after 2 years, \\"Grandin Automobiles\\" became the third French manufacturer. From 1981 to 1984, Dallas had a steel body, and from 1984 the hull was made of polyester with less army-like style. In 1987, the Dallas jeep changed: it adopted a new galvanized chassis and a fiberglass body, and was equipped with a PSA engine, making it a vehicle without any problems of corrosion and reliability. It is equipped with an XY8 engine with an all-aluminum block of 1360 cc. This engine with a Weber 35IBSH dual carburetor body is as simple as that fitted to the original Peugeot 104 ZS and the first Peugeot 205 XS, XT and GT. The peculiarity of this engine is that the gearbox is integrated into the engine block: the lubrication is common to both and when the engine is drained the gearbox is drained at the same time. This engine has a chain drive. In 1988 the Dallas series adopted the TU engines and a more modern design from the Citroen AX: the TU3S with Solex 32-34Z body double carburetor for the 205 XS, developing 85 horsepower. Distribution was now by toothed belt. The cylinder is exactly the same, consumption falls slightly. The TU3S motor is a sports motor by design. In 1993, the Dallas was re-styled and re-adopted the gasoline engine TU3M/Z and the XUD7 Diesel always came from the organ bank of PSA. Its chassis changed from 3 meters to 3.10 meters and its body became rounded. The TU3M/Z of the same size as its predecessor, 1360 cc, lost 10 hp and went to 75 horsepower in adopting injection. The XUD7 with a displacement of 1700 cc, developing 59ch, is a reliable, economical, and quite nervous when we seek a little, its \\"small\\" 60 horsepower is more than enough for the Dallas. In 1996, Frank sold his company and left the business. In 1998, production of the Dallas stopped. When the factory closed down, the last batch was sold by Dallas Auction. A little less than 5000 copies of this car were built from 1981 to 1998.

As young girls from Vrnjaƒçka Banja wanted to protect their own loves, they started writing down their names together with the names of their loved ones on padlocks. They bound these to the railings of the bridge where Nada and Relja used to meet. However, the tradition died out with time. It was not until Serbian writer and poet Desanka Maksimoviƒá wrote down a poem called A Prayer for Love, () that the legend regained popularity. People started once again to bind their love with so-called \\"love padlocks\\" to the bridge. Consequently, it acquired the name Bridge of Love. After people bind their love with a padlock to the railing, the keys should be thrown down into the river below, so they cannot be found ever again.https://abcnews.go.com/International/bridge-love-romance- padlocks-began/story?id=18488039 Another bridge in Serbia is also known by the name \\"Bridge of Love\\". It is the White Bridge in Vranje, which was built in the name of an unfulfilled tragic love.
