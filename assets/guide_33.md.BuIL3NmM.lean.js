The character first appeared in November 2009 portrayed by actress, Julie Mond. Mond was replaced by Brianna Brown in early 2010. Brown last appeared in the role in October 2011. The character is known for being a villain to popular characters Patrick Drake and Robin Scorpio. Casting It was announced in October, 2009 daytime newcomer, Julie Mond, was cast in the role of Lisa Niles, the ex-girlfriend of Patrick Drake. Mond first appeared on November 18, 2009. In December of that year, it was announced Mond was let go from the series as the character would be taken in a new direction, and her storyline would be altered. She was replaced by Brianna Brown, who first appeared in the role on January 6, 2010. Brown said of how she got the role, \\"I was very fortunate. I didn‚Äôt have to audition. I was offered the role because of previous work that I‚Äôd done and because I was up for a role on Guiding Light long ago. I ended up not taking it at that time but ironically it was the same casting director ‚Äî Mark Teschner. When my representation told Mark I was interested in being on a soap, Mark got really excited because he knew me from ages ago. He showed the reel on my website to the executive producer Jill Farren Phelps and to the head writer Bob and they really liked what I had done. We sat down, had a meeting to discuss the character and they gave me the role in the room! It was an ideal [situation]!\\" In June 2011, it was announced that under new head writer Garin Wolf, Brown would depart from the series. However, Brown started reappearing on a regular basis in September of that year. In October 2011, it was revealed Lisa would be killed off, as the start of a whodunit storyline on the series. This resulted in Brown last appearing on October 31, 2011. Character development Lisa Niles was introduced in late 2009, as the former girlfriend of Patrick Drake. Her storyline originally consisted of causing tension between Patrick and his wife Robin. This slowly evolved into Lisa seducing Patrick, which received the attention of several media outlets, including TV Guide. Head writer at the time, Robert Guza said of the direction the storyline was going in, \\"Lisa is going to get very obsessive with Patrick and we will go into a Fatal Attraction story. This is not a Glenn Close sort of thing. Lisa is not a psycho. She won't be boiling bunnies. But that's not to say she won‚Äôt be acting out in a big way. Lisa was never able to emotionally let go of that connection she had with Patrick back in school. When that is resurrected for one night‚Äîand Patrick says it can never happen again‚Äîshe tries very hard to accept that. And she fails. Miserably. We have a good long way to go with this story‚Äîin fact, we might easily get another year out of it. Patrick‚Äôs refusal to continue [having sex] is not what sets Lisa off. Rather, there‚Äôs a very small psychological event that will happen some weeks later. It gets her very perturbed.‚Äù Brown said about her character breaking up one of the show's most popular couples, \\" I was warned right away that it was a major relationship that my character would be breaking up. And I was forewarned: 'People are going to hate you'.\\" She also said of the opportunity to play Lisa as more of a villain, \\"But when I originally signed on, what I was so excited about and why I decided to take the role in the first place was because it was a Fatal Attraction storyline. So I loved the idea of getting to play that. I loved the idea of getting to play a villain because I normally don't get cast as a villain. It's been so much fun. Jumping in front of cars and then blaming someone else for it and drugging people. Who gets to play that? It's so out there!\\" Brown also said of playing a character that is loose in morals, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to say she doesn‚Äôt have a conscience, but she bends the rules.‚Äù Lisa's death in October 2011, marked the beginning of a high-profile mystery storyline. The investigation of murder gave viewers a chance to try the solve the crime along with the police, and determine which of the several suspects was the real murderer. Jill Farren Phelps said of the plot line, \\"This is Lisa's worst, most insidious plan yet. And it ends very badly for her. Lisa's death‚Äîapparently by blunt-force trauma‚Äîwill leave every one of the passengers looking guilty. Each of them ends up having the motive, the means and the opportunity to kill her. It's a very cleverly told mystery.\\" Storylines Dr. Lisa Niles is first introduced as the former college girlfriend of Patrick Drake. She arrives in November 2009, seeking help with a patient from Patrick's wife Robin Scorpio. She is soon hired onto the staff at General Hospital. She takes a brief interest in Matt Hunter, Patrick's brother. When Robin leaves town to take her daughter Emma to visit her mother, Anna Devane in London, Patrick helps Lisa move into her new apartment. Spending time with Patrick brings back old feelings, which at first she is subtle about and continues to act friendly towards Robin. Lisa later begins dating Steven Webber, which causes Patrick to act out in jealousy on a few occasions. Lisa has a one-night stand with Patrick while Robin is in Africa. Afterwards she continues to try to seduce Patrick again. Patrick and Lisa talk and Lisa agrees to back off. However, Lisa's obsession with Patrick starts to become more obvious. Robin finds defaced pictures of herself and believes Lisa did it. In August 2010, Lisa breaks into Robin and Patrick's house and steals Robin's HIV medicine. Lisa takes Emma on an unannounced ice cream trip, which scares the couple so much that Patrick confesses his affair with Lisa to Robin. Enraged, Robin leaves him. Lisa continues her efforts to prevent their reconciliation, and to deface Robin's character. Trying to convince the hospital staff that Robin is the unstable one, Lisa leaps in front of Robin's car to fake a hit-and-run. Soon after, she leaves Emma's toy rabbit in a boiling hospital bunsen burner for Robin to see. Perceiving this message as a threat to her child, Robin punches Lisa at the hospital, which prompts her suspension. Although still separated, Robin and Patrick concoct a scheme to make their break-up seem even more volatile in hopes this will lower Lisa's guard and Patrick will be able to coax a confession out of her. Soon Lisa secretly catches on. She replaces Robin's HIV medication with tranquilizers, then takes her to an isolated cabin after she passes out. Robin attempts to flee the cabin in her drugged state, but winds up falling down an old well outside. Mac interrogates Lisa but when nothing incriminating is found, Mac directs his suspicion towards Patrick and arrests him. After he's released, Patrick tracks down Robin and rescues her. Immediately after, Lisa confronts them and threatens suicide with a handgun. Patrick stops her and she is sent to a mental institution. However, she is released soon after, having passed psychiatric evaluations. Lisa resumes her efforts to get Patrick to sleep with her again. Meanwhile, she saves Robin and Emma from a fire, and Robin claims Lisa set the fire in the first place. While Robin is recovering, Lisa files a petition to have her fired from the hospital. However, while attempting to inject sodium pentothol into Robin's IV bag, Maxie catches her. Lisa runs out of the room and gives Johnny Zacchara the syringe. When the cops arrive, they find no proof, but Steve puts her on probation and the hearing to fire Robin is canceled. Soon, Johnny begins blackmailing Lisa with the syringe to get private medical attention. They eventually start a sexual relationship, but Lisa keeps her eyes on Patrick. Eventually, Johnny sets up a treasure hunt, leaving several clues for Lisa and Robin to find the syringe. Robin finds it first, and Lisa is close behind her. They both rush to the hospital at the same time that Jake Spencer is hit by a car and dies. In the aftermath, Robin is faced with a sense of what is important and reconciles with Patrick while forgetting about the syringe. Lisa takes advantage of Robin's distraction to steal the syringe and dispose of it. In March 2011, Lisa begins another revenge plot. She befriends Kristina Davis, Emma's new babysitter and gives her hydrocodone pills, which she passes off as herbal supplements. While Kristina is passed out babysitting, Lisa bugs the house, steals Patrick's credit card to make romantic purchases with, and takes pictures of their basement while researching home gas leaks. Ethan Lovett recognizes Kristina's pills as hydrocodone and informs Johnny, who warns Patrick. Lisa seemingly causes a gas leak and locks Robin in the basement, planning to frame Patrick for the murder. Lisa goes to check Robin's body, only to find her alive, when Mac and Patrick arrive. Mac arrests Lisa for attempted murder and it is revealed that Robin and Patrick were onto the plan and staged the set up. Patrick turned off the gas from outside while Robin recorded all of Lisa's threats and confessions on her cell phone. At the police station, Lisa begs Johnny for help, but he refuses. In May, Patrick visits Lisa in Shadybrook, where she gets under his skin by declaring he will never be truly happy with Robin. Subsequently, Lisa escapes from Shadybrook while in the midst of being moved to another facility. Lisa begs Johnny for help, and although he eventually agrees, his father, Anthony Zacchara, secretly convinces Lisa to continue with her revenge plans, offering to help. In June, Lisa invades General Hospital with a loaded gun takes Robin, Maxie, Patrick, and Steve hostage. She proceeds to put them through a mock trial outlining their poor treatment of her. Damian Spinelli breaks into the conference room right before she tries to shoot Maxie. When Maxie continues to back talk to her, Lisa pulls the trigger but Spinelli jumps in and takes the bullet. Lisa refuses to allow the doctors to aid Spinelli as she continues the mock trial. Jason and Dante finally override the lockdown and seemingly knock Lisa unconscious. As everyone scrambles to rush Spinelli to an operating room, Lisa recovers and holds a syringe full of drain cleaner to Robin's throat. Patrick attempts to talk Lisa down and then grabs her. In the ensuing struggle, Lisa accidentally sticks herself with the syringe and slips into a coma, with the doctors uncertain if she will ever come out of it. On September 15, 2011, Anthony is seen with a woman, who is lying in a hospital bed, and next to her on the table is a patients folder with the name \\"Lisa Niles\\" and an ID number on it. Anthony is seen again in Lisa's room on September 22, 2011, talking to a doctor, discussing a drug. Lisa is shown in bed with a respirator, and Anthony tells the doctor to \\"shoot her up\\". On September 23, Lisa is seen opening her eyes and awakening from her comatose state. In early-mid October, Lisa stabs Anthony with a nail, knocks out an Unnamed Nurse at GH/First Mate Briggs on the yacht, injects Johnny with an unknown substance, chloroforms: Elizabeth (also threw her overboard), Patrick and Robin. Lisa tries to inject Robins blood into Patrick, but Robin got loose and stops her. Later, Lisa and Robin fight again on the deck, Lisa pushes Robin into some stairs where she loses consciousness. Robin wakes up and Lisa has disappeared. Days later, Lisa's body is found floating in the harbor by Carly and Shawn. Maxie confesses to killing Lisa in March 2012 to punish herself for accidentally causing Robin's death. In May 2012, Lisa's true killer is revealed to be Matt, and he is sent to prison. Reception Initially, the character was not well received by fans of the series, as she was seen as a threat to fan favorite couple, Patrick Drake and Robin Scorpio. The Hollywood Reporter noted how Lisa started a \\"fan frenzy\\", as a result of the storyline. As the character's arc began to progress, Brown received much acclaim as Lisa began to be shown as more of a villain. The rivalry between Lisa and Robin also received critical praise, especially after Lisa and Patrick slept together. Yahoo! honored Lisa's departure from the series by featuring Lisa greatest moments, including kidnapping Emma Drake, shooting Damian Spinelli, and overtaking the party boat. The author of the feature, Alan Donahue said of her in comparison to General Hospital's other antagonists, \\"Starring alongside other villains like Franco and Anthony Zacchara, Lisa may have proved she is the craziest of all.\\" SoapNet named the storyline as one of the best \\"Fatal Attraction\\" daytime storylines, noting \\"Ever since bedding her ex, Patrick, Lisa has had eyes for the handsome Dr. Drake -- and death glares for his wife, Robin. Lisa's determined to get Robin out of the picture -- it seems by any means possible.\\" Sara A. Bibel of Xfinity was complimentary of the plot line in which Lisa enlists her ex-boyfriend Terrell Jackson to seduce Robin away from Patrick, comparing it to fan favorite storylines of the mid 1990s. The storyline saw a brief rise in the ratings for the series, but after a while the arc was cited as one of the reasons the ratings were slowly declining. The storyline was subject to some controversy in October, 2011, when Lisa attempted to inject Patrick with Robin's blood, thus injecting him with the HIV virus, which Robin has lived with for years. Several critics found it tasteless of the series to use HIV as a weapon, and thought it was contradictory of the positive portrayal of Robin living a healthy life with the virus for several years.

The company was founded in 1936, provides coverage to more than 3 million people and is a member of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBS). BCBSAL employs nearly 5,000 people, which includes almost 3,500 people at its corporate headquarters in Birmingham. The company also operates Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators and Cahaba Safeguard Administrators, both headquartered in Birmingham. It commands over 90 percent of the health insurance market in Alabama, a state with half a million uninsured people, one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation at 10 percent of the population. Organization BCBSAL is classified as a 501(m) company by the IRS. Under state law it is classified as a \\"special health-benefit service plan\\", not an insurance company, although its coverage functions like health insurance. As a special health-benefit service plan the Alabama Department of Insurance does not automatically review BCBSAL rates as long as the rating methodology doesn't change. BCBSAL owns/operates : *Alabama Industries Financial Corporation, which owns United Trust Insurance Company. *Preferred Care Services, which owns PCS LLC. *Prime Therapeutics, LLC and the Caring Foundation. (See BCBS organizational chart) United Trust Insurance Company In 1986 BCBSAL had acquired a life insurance company named Modern American Life Insurance Company, incorporated in 1964. A lawsuit forced BCBSAL to change life insurance coverage to disability coverage, and the company was renamed to United Trust Insurance Company in 1988. Over the years it came to assume risk associated with BCBSAL long-term care policies, and sold short term disability coverage. By the end of 2012, the company held US$1 million of capital stock and a surplus of US$986 million. United Trust Insurance Company had agreements with multiple other insurance companies like Able Benefit Solutions, BCS (Bishop, Cannon and Stacy) Insurance Company, Companion Life Insurance Company/Medical risk Managers Inc, Glencairn Health and Specialty. It was tasked with marketing stop and excess-loss reinsurance products. It was deemed an 18 U.S.C.¬ß 1033 insurer, but 1033 did not apply, because it had no employees. Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators, LLC Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators (GBA), headquartered in Birmingham, has been a financial intermediary with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administering Alabama Medicare fee-for-service claims. Prior to Medicare contracting reform in 2005, CMS awarded Cahaba a no bid contract. In January 2009, Cahaba won a US$335 million 5-year contract with the CMS to administer Medicare insurance in 3 more states besides Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and in Mississippi for part B Medicare./ The contract's full name is 'Jurisdiction 10 (J10) A/B Medicare Administrative Contract'. Cahaba also provides Regional Home Health Intermediary coverage for numerous states across the country. Cahaba Safeguard Administrators, LLC Cahaba Safeguard Administrators, headquartered in Birmingham, was founded in 2002 to administer Medicare fraud prevention and is one of 12 contractors under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Leadership compensation Former CEO Terry D. Kellogg's total compensation for 2013 was $4.84 million, including a salary of $999,959, bonuses of $3,580,651 and other compensation of $257,227, representing a raise of 95.5% since 2011. The company is considered by many employees to be one of the best places to work in the Birmingham metropolitan area, taking into account pay and other factors. The corporate culture also ranks high among reviewers. History BCBSAL was founded in 1936 as the Hospital Service Corporation. In 1952, the company changed its name to Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Alabama. In 1970, the name was changed back to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama L. By that year, it had increased its enrollment to over 1 million people. By 1994, the company increased enrollment to 2 million members statewide and by 2016, it increased to over 3 million nationwide. Even though other companies are available, over 90% of the Alabama market continues to choose BCBSAL Enrollment is again expected to grow in 2017, considering all other companies in Alabama have abandoned the Health Insurance Marketplace (Obamacare) Exchange. At the end of 2011, BCBSAL assets had totaled $2.4 billion, according to the Alabama Department of Insurance records. It had a revenue of $4.1 billion and a net income of $257 million in 2011, a 58 percent gain from 2010. Yet, still the 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services survey found BCBSAL offered the second-most affordable employer- sponsored family health plans in the country; and more than 90 cents of every dollar in premiums is returned to members in the form of benefits. , BCBSAL had amassed a surplus of $991 million, which the insurance industry calls \\"unassigned funds\\". These savings, which amount to about 3.3 months of typical claims expenses - or one basic emergency room visit per member, are insurance against fluctuations in short-term conditions that could affect the company's ability to pay claims. It makes BCBSAL self-insured since the company is not a beneficiary of the Alabama insurance guaranty funds. It provides financial stability and self-reliance for the company, and therefore the members, with regard to claims. (The Alabama insurance guaranty fund is an emergency reserve pool maintained by periodic levies on all insurance companies to create a cash fund to pay the obligations of struggling insurers, similar to FDIC for banks.)

He also served as the 14th Dean of Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science and as the Associate Provost of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Career Higher education Pe√±a-Mora is the Edwin Howard Armstrong Professor of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Columbia University. Previously, he was also the dean of the Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science at the university. As dean, he focused on implementing a three-pronged strategic plan encompassing faculty excellence, student support, and space growth. During his deanship, the School of Engineering and Applied Science doubled its endowed chairs and raised $75 million for Columbia Engineering. Pe√±a-Mora also led the reformulation of the online Master's program in engineering, which ranked number 1 in the 2013 U.S. News & World Report. Pe√±a-Mora's tenure was controversial. A number of faculty members and department chairmen passed a \\"no-confidence\\" vote in his leadership. They criticized his self-serving style of management, his hasty expansion of the engineering school, which overloaded professors with too many students, and asserted that he prioritized fund-raising over research and did not honor his promises. One of Pe√±a-Mora's most vocal critics, Van C. Mow, called him a \\"control freak\\" and stepped down from his position as Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering in 2011. Mow's harsh critique was challenged by some as being driven by his general \\"resistance to change,\\" especially when implemented by a dean 26 years his junior. After various attempts to bridge the differences, Pe√±a-Mora eventually resigned in July 2012. Pe√±a-Mora resigned from his position as Dean in July 2012. As a results, some questioned their ‚Äúconfidence‚Äîas well as the confidence of many others at Columbia‚Äîin the ability of Columbia to maintain diverse leadership at the top.‚Äù Faculty, students and community leaders complained about ‚Äúracial bias in its ranks‚Äú. A highly regarded Hispanic biology professor has complained to Columbia President Lee Bollinger about the \\"ethnic bullying\\", \\"unbridled racism\\" and \\"the shameful bullying of our engineering Dean Pe√±a-Mora shows similar characteristics\\" to the ‚Äògauntlet‚Äô other minority faculty have faced at Columbia.‚Äù Another professor communicated how senior faculty in engineering even ‚Äúcomplain about his [Pe√±a-Mora] Spanish accent\\"; which was especially surprising, given that Israel-born Zvi Galil, Dean of the Engineering School from 1995‚Äì2007, had a strong accent that was \\"loved\\" by many. Pe√±a-Mora continues to supervise PhD and graduate research students and was listed as being on \\"public service leave\\" while serving at the DDC. He maintains a named professorship with a salary of more than $500,000 in 2015 on top of his salary as Commissioner. Public service On April 8, 2014, Dr. Pe√±a-Mora was appointed the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Design and Construction (DDC) by Mayor Bill de Blasio. While Commissioner, Pe√±a-Mora visited many of the DDC's projects, including the rehabilitation of the High Bridge, which restored a vital link between upper Manhattan and the Bronx; the new New York City Police Academy in College Point, Queens, which will train more than 1,600 new police officers each year to protect the City; the Ocean Breeze Athletic Center, which symbolizes continued investment in neighborhoods impacted by Hurricane Sandy; and, the transformation of Times Square into a permanent pedestrian plaza. Controversy followed Pe√±a-Mora to the public sector in 2016 when a supposed quid pro quo scheme was uncovered, as Pe√±a-Mora directed DDC funds and City contracts to Renee Sacks, and organizations she works with, and Sacks' firm, Sacks Communications, made its entire Spring 2016 issue of Diversity/Agenda magazine all about Pe√±a-Mora. On June 21, 2017, Pe√±a-Mora announced his plans to step down from the DDC.

It is part of the UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site that encompasses the Old City. History Zeughausgasse was originally called vor den Predigern after the nearby Prediger Abbey. The Dominican abbey was built throughout the 13th and 14th Centuries. In 1527 the abbey was secularized and the street changed names to Beim Totentanz after a Dance of Death painting cycle by Niklaus Manuels on the abbey wall. The long wall was painted with the fresco in 1520 which remained until the demolition of the wall in 1660.Weber - Totentanzmauer Even though the painting was destroyed in the 17th Century, the street remained Beim Totentanz until the 18th Century. In 1745 it was renamed Zeughausgasse and widened. The Zeughaus or armory, that the street was named after, had originally been a workhouse for the abbey and occupied what would become Zeughausgasse 18-28, N√§geligasse 4-6 and 7-13. In 1876 the old armory was demolishedWeber - Grosses Zeughaus and in 1880 the street was widened.

Blue has been used in the heraldry of the French monarchy since at least the 12th century, with the golden fleurs-de-lis of the kings always set on a blue (heraldic \\"azure\\") background. A brighter version, based on the blue of the French Tricolour, is used in modern times, particularly in a sporting context. French national teams in all sports will normally use blue as their main colour. Blue is France's national racing colour; therefore, several French motorsport teams have used it, including Alpine, Amilcar, Ballot, Bugatti, Delage, Delahaye, Gordini, Ligier, Mathis, Matra, Panhard, Pescarolo Sport, Peugeot, Prost Grand Prix, Rondeau, Salmson, Talbot-Lago, Voisin. The two notable exceptions are Citro√´n and Renault: the former has used red and white, whereas the latter has used yellow and black.

(click to enlarge) The Z√§hringerstadt is a historic section in the Old City of Bern in Bern, Switzerland. The first expansion of Bern occurred as the city was founded in 1191. This central and oldest neighbourhood was known as the Z√§hringerstadt (Z√§hringer town) after the founder, Duke Berthold V of Z√§hringen. Most likely the first city started at Nydegg Castle on the Aare river and reached west on the narrow peninsula to the Zytglogge (Swiss German: clock tower). The city was divided by three longitudinal streets, which stretched from the Castle to the city wall. Both the position of the town church and the shape of the eaves were typical for a Z√§hringer city. During the first half of the 13th Century two additional streets (Brunngasse and Herrengasse) were added. Brunngasse was a semi-circular street on the north edge of the city, while Herrengasse was on the south side of the city. A wood bridge was built over the Aare River which allowed increased trade and limited settlements on the east bank of the river. The Z√§hringerstadt contained the medieval city's principal political, economic and spiritual institutions. These were strictly separated: official buildings were situated around the Kreuzgasse (Cross Alley), ecclesiastical buildings were located at the M√ºnstergasse (Cathedral Alley) and Herrengasse (Lords' Alley), while guilds and merchants' shops clustered around the central Kramgasse (Grocers Alley) and Gerechtigkeitsgasse (Justice Alley). Junkerngasse (Junker Lane), which is parallel to Gerechtigkeitsgasse, was originally known as Kilchgasse (Church Lane) but was renamed because of number of patricians or untitled nobility which lived on the southern side of the peninsula. The original city wall between the Z√§hringerstadt and the Innere Neustadt was demolished during a later expansion and Kornhausplatz grew up in the area of the wall. The original city gate became the Zytglogge.

It premiered on Game Show Network (GSN) on March 4, 2010, with a new episode airing each Thursday for eight weeks, concluding on April 23. The show features contestants who are placed in unusual situations and are filmed with a hidden camera. The contestants are then tested on what they just experienced to see how good their memories are. The more correct answers they provide, the more cash and prizes they win. While one writer was optimistic about the show's performance, another was skeptical, and poor television ratings led to only one season being produced. Gameplay alt=Television host Wink Martindale, wearing a black suit and tie. Hosted by Wink Martindale with Angela Daun, both of whom appear in every segment of the show, Instant Recall features several additional main cast members who serve as actors in the first segment of the game. Each episode is filmed in two segments, with the first being shot with hidden cameras. At this point, the contestant does not know he or she is being filmed or even on the show itself. The actors enter the scene to make the contestant a witness in an \\"outrageous situation.\\" At the end of the scenario, one of the actors asks the contestant, \\"Do you like game shows?\\", after which Martindale enters to inform the contestant that he or she is on a hidden camera game show. The second segment of the game is then played, in which the contestant must answer questions relating to what he or she just witnessed, testing his or her memory. The contestant begins with $500 and can earn up to an additional $3,000 depending on how many questions are answered correctly. Production Instant Recall was first announced on February 5, 2010. Adam Tyler, Ron Deutsch, Gary Dawson, and David Franzke (who had previously been involved with the hidden camera show Punk'd) served as executive producers. The series premiered on March 4, 2010, at 8:30 PM ET. The series aired a new episode in that time slot every week, concluding with its eighth and final episode on April 23, 2010. Reception Before the series premiered, About.com game show writer Carrie Grosvenor was optimistic about the show's potential success, arguing that it would likely be an improvement over GSN's previous hidden camera show, Hidden Agenda. She also applauded GSN for hiring Martindale to host, saying, \\"It'll be great to see him back on television.\\" Instant Recalls ratings were below average for GSN, with CNN's James Dinan describing them as \\"ratings woes\\". The series' debut episode's ratings were lower than those of its lead-in, Carnie Wilson: Unstapled, though they picked up slightly in April.

Its common name is derived from Ning, the one-character abbreviation for Nanjing and Qi, which refers to Qidong, a county-level city of Nantong. Despite its name, the railway currently runs as far as east as Nantong East railway station, and does not extend into Qidong itself, although this remaining section is under construction. At its present state, the railway is in length. It runs along the northern bank of the Yangtze River, serving cities such as Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Hai'an.

History Planning for a railway along the north bank of the Yangtze River began as early as 1958. In 1977, the government of Jiangsu province designated the railway from Nanjing to Nantong as a project for completion within the next 10 years. Due to funding shortage and disagreement over route, the project was not built for 20 years. The project was revived in the late 1990s with the onset of construction on the Xinyi‚ÄìChangxing railway, which was the first railway to be built in Jiangsu province north of the Yangtze River. In 2001, the Ministry of Railways approved plans for the Ningqi railway, and construction was built in two phases. The Nanjing to Hai'an section was built from March 1, 2002 to December 2003. The Haian to Yangzhou and Nantong sections were completed by July 2005. A major upgrade project on the Nanjing‚ÄìQidong railway was completed in December 20, 2015. This involved the electrification of the railway line and building a second track.

Directed by John Landis from an original screenplay by Nick Moorcroft and Piers Ashworth, the film stars Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis as William Burke and William Hare respectively. It was Landis's first feature film release in 12 years, the last being 1998's Susan's Plan. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 29 October 2010. Plot The film opens in Edinburgh. Narration by Angus the Hangman explains how the corpses of the hanged are transported to Dr Robert Knox for dissection. Knox's rival, Dr Alexander Monro, wants the steady supply of cadavers but is forced to rely on severed limbs for dissection. Monro's assistant Charles Darwin arrives with a letter containing a bylaw directing that all corpses thenceforth must be sent to Monro. Angus tells Knox's assistant, Patterson, the news. Patterson delivers the message to Knox. William Burke and William Hare, immigrants from Ulster, attempt to sell cheese mould as a patent medicine. When their fraud is discovered, they flee to an inn owned by Hare's wife, Lucky. One of her lodgers has died, and she wants Burke and Hare to remove the body. On the way, they stop for a drink and Hare hears from Fergus, a local henchman of villain Danny McTavish, that Dr Knox pays for cadavers, especially now demand has gone up. Burke and Hare decide to sell the corpse to Knox. They are forced to break the corpse's spine to fit it into a barrel in order to smuggle it through the city. Burke and Hare present the now-mangled corpse to Knox. After some negotiation, Knox agrees to pay them a good sum of money for each corpse they bring him for dissection. In addition to using cadavers in lectures, Knox is attempting to create a pictorial reference of the human body by using an early form of photography. Using this, he hopes to win royal patronage from the king when he comes to Holyrood Palace. Burke and Hare try grave-digging to procure more cadavers. They accidentally dig up a long-dead body and are then caught by the militia, who chase them out of the cemetery, shooting Burke in the rear end in the pursuit. Back at the inn, they find Lucky drunk and barely conscious. Lucky says she is drinking because Joseph, another lodger at the inn, is near death. Not willing to wait for the outcome, Burke and Hare suffocate Joseph and take the body to Knox. Flush with money, Burke and Hare dress up for a night in a posher pub. There they meet a young former prostitute, Ginny Hawkins, who performs an excerpt from Macbeth to the indifferent patrons. Burke is instantly taken with Ginny and asks her about her performance. Ginny proves to be an intelligent and ambitious young woman whose dream is to become an actress. Burke plans to use his money to finance Ginny's theatrical ambitions, and Hare decides to open a funeral parlour. Hare comes home to find Lucky in good spirits and waiting with a home-cooked meal. He is suspicious, then scared when Lucky tells him she knows what he and Burke have been up to. Surprisingly, she thinks it a good idea and makes Hare give her a pound per corpse as a tax between man and wife. Burke is kidnapped and bundled into a carriage by McTavish and Fergus, who have already captured Hare. McTavish threatens to kill them unless they give him half the money from Knox. Forced to agree, they are then thrown from the carriage. As they trek back to the inn, they plan a string of murders to make up their losses to McTavish. The people of Edinburgh becomes suspicious of all the deaths in the area, as does police captain Tom McLintock of the militia. Missing posters of the dead are put up and Burke begins to panic. Hare says they have finished the murders and will go into the funeral parlour business. McTavish kidnaps Hare again and attempts to extort the remainder of the money. Shortly afterward, McTavish appears as Knox's next dissection cadaver, where McLintock recognises his body. He discovers Knox's collection of anatomical photographs, recognising many of the photos as people who were reported missing. Knox confesses his arrangement with Burke and Hare. McLintock arrests Burke and Ginny, and Hare and Lucky, while both couples are having sex. In prison, Burke is repentant, but Hare tells him not to confess or all of them, including the women, will be hanged. Meanwhile, the Solicitor General and the Lord Provost want to keep the scandal out of the papers, as the news would ruin the reputation of Edinburgh's medical schools and the money they generate. They bribe McLintock into a deal by making him a colonel. Knox's anatomical photographs are destroyed. McLintock tells the prisoners that if any one of them confesses to the murders, the others will go free. Burke agrees to confess if he and Ginny can finish what they were doing when McLintock apprehended them. Just before Burke's hanging, Angus asks Burke for his final words. Seeing Ginny in the crowd, Burke says that he did it for love Onscreen text over the credits describes the fates of all the characters in the story, concluding with an image of the actual skeleton of William Burke at the Anatomical Museum of the University of Edinburgh Medical School.

John Landis read the screenplay, which piqued his interest in making the film. Landis wanted the film to be similar in style to Ealing's black comedies, as well as to the films of Laurel and Hardy, describing the portrayal of Burke and Hare in this film as an \\"evil Laurel and Hardy\\".John Landis interview, Burke & Hare DVD, IFC Films, 2011 Casting David Tennant was originally cast in the role of William Hare, but left the production before principal photography began; he was replaced by Andy Serkis.

Its aim is to connect and represent the voices of children across the United States, with the end goal to propose a funding solution for the lead contamination in the soil of New Orleans, Louisiana. Description People in the United States and around the globe are invited to draw their own 100 dollar bills on a template, and send them to regional collection centers or schools, for safekeeping. During a nationwide road-trip in an armored truck, the Fundred Dollar Bills will be collected. The Fundred Dollar Bills will be presented to Congress for an even exchange of U.S. dollars to help the remediation of lead in the soil of New Orleans. This funding supports Operation Paydirt, which is the program that, once implemented, will remediate the lead content in the soil, making it safe for inhabitants of New Orleans and cities affected by lead poisoning-across the United States. So far nearly half a million people have created and sent in their unique Fundred bills. The intention is to collect three million Fundred bills. Armored Truck Tour Throughout 2010, students at hundreds of schools across the country created Fundred Dollar Bills that were picked up in a specially designed armored truck that runs on vegetable oil. As students and educators handed their Fundreds over to truck guards for safekeeping, schools held events that raised awareness of the gravity and persistence of the lead in our environment. These events gave local elected officials and community organizations a chance to show their support for lead cleanup while giving local press brought the issue to larger audiences. At every stop the armored truck tour connected the national campaign for lead awareness. Each event around the country not only provided public and impassioned demonstrations against lead poisoning, but brought people together to make connections around this public health issue. Grand Rapids In the fall of 2014, the ArtPrize competition in Grand Rapids, Michigan featuring the Fundred Dollar Bill Project, offered an opportunity to raise visibility of local lead issues and invite participation from the tends of thousands of expected visitors. Visitors to the exhibit sat at bank teller tables and drew their unique Fundreds. Once drawn, their Fundreds were added to hundreds of others on a wall in the exhibit, making their artful demonstrations part of the exhibit for its duration. In addition to creating a public display of action-oriented art, the Grand Rapids initiative brought together local public health specialists, educators, and scientists to talk about the challenges and solutions to lead poisoning in Grand Rapids. Art Academy in Cincinnati In 2015, the Art Academy of Cincinnati partnered with the Fundred Dollar Bill Project and the Cincinnati Health Department Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program to create a course that used art and design to address and impact issues of lead contamination in Cincinnati. With the Fundred Dollar Bill Project as a common starting point and inspiration, students launched group projects to increase awareness of childhood lead poisoning and our ability to put an end to it. Students exhibited their projects at a publicly accessible end of semester block party. Students explored lead poisoning through dance performance and graphic design and created a learning-through-play area. The Health Department shared information about lead, and a public Fundred drawing table provided opportunity for attendees to sit together for conversation and to creatively put their values in action. Open Lab initiatives Fundred Reserve Open Lab at H-Space, located in DC, is a space to expand the Fundred program by continuing to amplify personal stories, having fact based dialogue about problems in DC, and engaging more people to take purposeful action. Open Lab continues the presence after the 2017 Fundred Reserve exhibition at The Corcoran. Open Lab programming runs from October through April 2018, with space provided by Hamiltonian Artists, and support from The Kresge Foundation through our partnership with MIT CoLab. Exhibition As an extension of Mel Chin's multi-venue exhibition, All Over the Place (April 8 - September 5, 2018), the Fundred Project is on view at the Queens Museum as part of the exhibition.

Information Brass attended Cornell University, where he was an editor of The Cornell Daily Sun and member of the Quill and Dagger society. After a journalism career as a reporter and then editor at the New York Daily News, as well as restaurant critic for Playboy Magazine and WNBC-TV, Brass entered the technology field. In the late 1970s, Brass developed the first dictionary-based spelling checker and invented the electronic thesaurus. He founded Dictronics Publishing Inc, which acquired the exclusive rights to many of the world's most important reference works, including The Random House Dictionary and Roget's Thesaurus. Dictronics was sold to Wang Laboratories in 1983. In 1987, Brass joined Oracle Corporation as a vice president and served as president of one of its subsidiaries. He was involved in a [proposed] tie-up between Oracle and McCaw Cellular. Investments During the 1980s, Brass became one of the first investors in Omnipoint, a cell phone startup that through growth and merger ultimately emerged as T-Mobile. Brass helped recruit various other lead investors, including Oracle's founder and CEO Larry Ellison and New York attorney and philanthropist James Ross. Omnipoint merged with Voicestream Wireless Corp in 1999. In July 2001, Voicestream was acquired by Deutsche Telekom for $50.7 billion, and in September 2002 changed the company name to T-Mobile. In 1997, Brass joined Microsoft, serving as corporate vice president. He was responsible for the development of ClearType and led the project to develop the company's tablet PC and e-book. In October 1998, during his keynote speech at the world's first ebook conference in Gaithersberg, MD, Brass proposed the Open Ebook (OEB) standard, which was adopted by most of the pioneering e-book publishers. It became the basis for the organization and formatting of most e-books in the world today and evolved into the popular ePub format in 2007. Brass was recognized for this contribution with an award for meritorious service from the government's National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). Brass also led the company's Emerging Technology group and its automotive software unit. He retired in 2004. In February, 2010, he wrote a widely read op-ed for The New York Times in which he argued that Microsoft had lost its ability to effectively innovate in many fields and needed to regain creative leadership. He blamed the highly competitive corporate culture, which he said undermined true innovations created by Microsoft's labs and engineers.

One description of a show, from the event's blog: The final episode of this run included a gunfight between the King of Texas' Army and the cast of Get Loweded with everyone except for an adopted orphan dying. Season 3 (September 2009-June 2010) Get Loweded in the Golden Age of Television For the beginning of their third run, Get Loweded is tackling the Golden Age of Television. They now are set between 1957 and 1963 supposedly airing on the DuMont Network. They are staging a \\"late night television show\\" which was unwatched at the time, but later became a favorite of a video store clerk. They produced a \\"mockumentary\\" about this show to explain the premise. The performers don guises appropriate to this era: Jackson Lowe is a former mid level crooner and entertainer. Emmett Montgomery, Mr. Hopeful, was Jackson Lowe's partner while travelling the Borscht Belt who was later blacklisted under McCarthyism. Danielle Radford became Daniella Marie, a black entertainer who met Jackson and Emmett while working the Chitlin Circuit. She adopted the guise of a woman of Italian descent to better be able to work in television. Evilyn Sin Claire became a former showgirl whose outspoken women's lib views resulted in a lack of opportunities and arrests. Ronald McFondle became Ronny Fondlestein, a disgraced former children's show host who through a loophole in his contract was allowed to give away one more prize. He rigs his game, \\"the Rub\\" so that no one can ever win and he continues to be employed. Jack Portwood was a former big band leader and jingle writer (his character is credited with penning the Chock full o'Nuts \\"That Heavenly Feeling\\" jingle) who, after reading the writings of Jack Kerouac left behind the big band for a more \\"portable\\" method: the acoustic guitar. Prize girl Brandi Bratrude became a disgraced former beauty queen and magician's assistant who, after allegedly becoming pregnant with the child of a studio exec was banished to the late night for the extent of her contract. The antagonists for this run are the network head, Chas Roberts, who uses Get Loweded as an embezzlement front and Joey Jacobs the much better known host of an earlier program who steals Get Loweded's ideas and footage. Joey Jacobs often appears in the audience with a notebook and pen taking notes and occasionally upstages Jackson Lowe, who is the only cast member aware of his antics. Closing the show Preceding the start of their February 5, 2010 show, Get Loweded producer Chas Roberts announced that the current run would be the final season of Get Loweded. The last show is scheduled for June 4, 2010. This was verified on their Facebook fan page with this announcement: References Category:Culture of Seattle ","title":"Get Loweded"},{"id":"26073510","text":"Still () (sometimes written Stile) is a town and commune in El M'Ghair District, El Oued Province, Algeria.

Tipis, tipi liners, shields, parfleches, robes, clothing, drums, and winter counts could all be painted. Sioux parfleche, ca. 1900, Gilcrease Museum Genres Art historian Joyce Szabo writes that Plains artists were concerned \\"with composition, balance, symmetry, and variety.\\"Szabo, 4 Designs can be similar to those found in earlier rock art and later quillwork and beadwork. Geometric painting Kiowa parfleche, ca. 1890, Oklahoma History Center Plains women traditionally paint abstract, geometric designs.Szabo, 5\\"More About Buffalo Hide Painting.\\" National Museum of American History. (retrieved 4 Feb 2010) Bright colors were preferred and areas were filled with solid fields of color. Cross-hatching was a last resort used only when paint was scarce. Negative space was important and designs were discussed by women in terms of their negative space. Dots are used to break up large areas. Buffalo robes and parfleches were frequently painted with geometrical patterns. Parfleches are rawhide envelopes for carrying and storing goods, including food. Their painted designs are thought to be stylized maps, featuring highly abstract geographic features such as rivers or mountains.Goes in Center, John. \\"Native American and First Nations' GIS.\\" Native Geography. 2000 (retrieved 4 Feb 2010) The \\"Feathered Sun\\" is a reoccurring motif of stylized feathers in several concentric circles. It visually connects a feather warbonnet to the sun.Dubin, 236-7 Representational painting Pawnees battling the Villasur expedition Traditionally, men painted representational art.Szabo, 7 They painted living things. Plains Indian male artists use a system of pictographic signs, characterized by two-dimensionality, readily recognizable by other members of their tribe.Szabo, 5, 7 This picture writing could be used for anything from directions and maps to love letters. Images were streamlined and backgrounds were minimal for clarity. Representational painting typically fell into two categories: heraldic accounts or calendars. Heraldic painting Men recorded their battle and hunting exploits on hide tipi liners, robes, and even shirts.Szabo, 10 Figures were scattered across the hide and semi- transparent images sometimes overlapped each other.Szabo, 31 Narrative hides were often read right to left, with the protagonist emerging from the right.Szabo, 32 Allies are on the right with enemies on the left.Penney, 114 Men and horses were commonly painted, and other popular motifs included footprints, hoofprints, name glyphs, bullets, and arrows. An 1868 Blackfoot buffalo hide features the protagonist no fewer than eight times.\\"Buffalo Robe.\\" British Museum. (retrieved 4 Feb 2010) Painted hides also commemorate historical events, such as treaty signings. After 1850, hide painting grew in complexity with finer lines and additional details added.Szabo, 12 Introduced technologies influenced hide painting, and a 19th-century Omaha tipi featured steamboats. Calendars Kiowa winter count by Anko, ca. 1895 Traditional Plains calendars are called winter counts because among most Plains tribes they feature a single pictogram that defined the entire year. Prior to using the Gregorian calendar, Lakota people counted years from first snow to first snow. Kiowas were unique in choosing two images per year‚Äì one for the winter and one representing the summer Sun Dance.Szabo, 7-8 Before the late 19th century when buffalo became scarce, winter counts were painted in buffalo hides. The annual pictograms could be arranged in a linear, spiral, or serpentine pattern.Szabo, 8 Visionary painting Visions and dreams could inspire designs. Buckskin covers for circular rawhide hide shields, in particular, are inspired by men's visions and can include paintings of humans, animals, or spirit beings, reflecting the owner's personal powers and providing protection.Penney, 112 Designs could be obtained from the warriors who received the visions or from medicine men. Cheyenne men who received visions were allowed to make four shields with the design. Among the Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache about 50 possible shield designs existed.Szabo, 6 Tipis could be painted with visionary designs. The design and related power belonged to the tipi-owner, which could be transferred by inheritance, marriage, or, among some tribes such as the Blackfeet, sale. Followers of the Ghost dance religion painted visionary designs on their clothing. Arapaho and Lakota ghost dance shirts were painted with crows, magpies, turtles, and cedar trees. Process and materials Buffalo hides, as well as deer, elk, and other animal hides, are painted. Clothing and robes are often brain-tanned to be soft and supple. Parfleches, shields, and moccasin soles are rawhide for toughness. In the past, Plains artists used a bone or wood stylus to paint with natural mineral and vegetable pigments. Sections of buffalo rib could be ground to expose the marrow, which was absorbent and worked like a contemporary ink marker.Penney, 124 Swelling cottonwood buds provided brown pigment.Szabo, 13 Lakota artists used to burn yellow clay to produce ceremonial red paint. Lakotas associated blue pigments with women.Dubin, 246 In earlier times, all members of a tribe might paint but highly skilled individuals might be commissioned by others to create artwork. Before the 20th century, when a Kiowa man needed to repaint his lodge, he would invite 20-30 friends to paint the entire tipi in a single day. He would then treat them all to a feast. Related art forms Many tribes throughout North America, besides those on the Plains, also painted hides, following different aesthetic traditions. Subarctic tribes are known for their painted caribou hides. On the Plains, when buffalo herds were being slaughtered in the late 19th century, other painting surfaces became available, such as muslin, paper, and canvas, giving birth to Ledger art.Szabo, 16 Contemporary Plains beadwork and jewelry used designs from hide painting.Dubin, 263 Gallery Image:003 Knife River Village Buffalo Robe.jpg|Knife River Villages buffalo robe featuring the \\"Feathered Sun\\" motif, photo by Chris Light Image:Bags and pouches of Sioux.jpg|Sioux beaded and painted rawhide parfleches File:-Woman chopping firewood, Eagle tipi in foreground, Star tipi on left-. 815.jpg|Siksika tipis in Montana, photo by Walter McClintock.

Background: systems, applications and users  People are represented by user objects or login accounts on different systems and applications. Examples of systems and applications include: * LDAP directories. * Microsoft Active Directory and Novell eDirectory. * Operating systems such as Linux, Unix, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX and Windows Server. * Mainframe security products such as RAC/F, CA ACF/2 and CA TopSecret. * ERP applications such as SAP R/3, PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, Lawson Financials and Oracle eBusiness Suite. * E-mail systems such as Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes. * Databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2 and MySQL. * A variety of other, custom or vertical-market systems and applications.. User objects generally consist of: * A unique identifier. * A description of the person who has been assigned the user object‚Äîprincipally their name. * Contact information for that person, such as their e-mail address, phone numbers, mailing address, etc. * Organizational information about that person, such as the ID of their manager, their department or their location. * A password and/or other authentication factors. Note that users need not be able to log into a system or application. The user object may be a record in an HR application or an entry in a phone book system, which the user cannot log into but which nonetheless represents the user. User objects are generally connected to other parts of a system or application through security entitlements. On most systems, this is done by placing a user into one or more security groups, where users of each group are granted some security rights.  User lifecycle processes  Organizations implement business processes to create, manage and delete user objects on their systems and applications: * Onboarding: ** Represents the steps taken when a new employee is hired, a contractor starts work, or a customer or partner is granted access to systems. ** This term alludes to the process of loading passengers onto a commercial airliner. * Management: ** Users are dynamic‚Äîthey change names, addresses, responsibilities and more. ** Changes experienced by users in the physical world must be reflected by user objects on systems and applications. * Support: ** Users sometimes experience problems with systems and applications. They may forget their password or require new security entitlements, for example. ** User support means changing data about users on systems and applications, resetting user passwords and so on, to resolve user problems. * Deactivation: ** Users have a finite lifespan and normally an even shorter relationship with an organization where a system or application is managed. ** When users leave‚Äîtermination, resignation, retirement, end of contract, end of customer relationship, etc. -- their access to systems and applications should likewise be deactivated. Incidentally, the term lifecycle does not imply that users who have been deactivated will necessarily not be onboarded again. However, this does happen. For example, employees may leave a company and be re-hired later, or contractors may end their contract only to be hired as employees.  User provisioning systems  User provisioning systems are intended to help organizations streamline user lifecycle processes so that updates to user objects on their systems and applications can be made: * More quickly‚Äîso users don't have to wait for changes. * More efficiently‚Äîto reduce the cost of managing systems and applications in response to user lifecycle events. * More securely‚Äîto reduce the risk of system compromise due to user objects that have outlived their usefulness, due to inappropriate security entitlements and due to easily guessed or otherwise compromised passwords.  User provisioning processes  A user provisioning system may implement one or more processes to achieve the aforementioned goals. These processes may include: * Auto-provisioning. For example: ** Monitor an HR application and automatically create new users on other systems and applications when new employee records appear in the HR database. * Auto-deactivation. For example: ** Monitor an HR application and automatically deactivate users objects on other systems and applications when an employee records either disappears or is marked as inactive in the HR database. ** Automatically deactivate user objects for users, such as contractors, whose scheduled termination date has passed. * Identity synchronization. For example: ** When changes in a user's e-mail address are detected on a mail system, automatically update the same user's e-mail address on other systems. ** When changes in a user's name, phone number or mailing address are detected on an HR system, automatically update the same user's e-mail address on other systems. * Self-service profile changes. For example: ** Allow users to update their own contact information. * Self-service access requests. For example: ** Allow users to request access to systems and applications. * Delegated access requests. For example: ** Allow managers to request access to systems and applications on behalf of their direct subordinates. * Authorization workflow. For example: ** Ask business stake-holders to review and either approve or reject proposed changes to user profiles or access rights. * Access certification. For example: ** Periodically ask managers to verify that the list of their direct subordinates (a) are still employed with the organization and (b) still report to them. ** Periodically data or application owners to verify a list of users with access to their data or application.  User provisioning system components  A user provisioning system must, in general, include some or all of the following components: * Connectors, to read information about users from integrated systems and applications and to send updates (e.g., create new user, delete user, modify user information) back to those systems and applications. * An internal database, that tracks user objects and other data from integrated systems and applications. * An auto-discovery system, which populates the internal database using the connectors. * A user interface where users can review the contents of the internal database, make change requests, approve or reject proposed changes, etc. * A workflow engine, used primarily to invite users to review and either approve or reject changes. * A policy engine, which evaluates both current user information and proposed changes to see if they meet corporate rules and regulations. * A reporting engine, which helps organizations extract information from the internal database.

In 2008, Clearspring Technologies, Inc. acquired AddThis, LLC, with the intent of creating a single content sharing platform for publishers under one brand: AddThis. The combined platform per Comscore was 254 million unique users. Clearspring upgraded AddThis with widget-sharing capabilities from LaunchPad, then discontinued the LaunchPad offering, reaching 600 million unique users by the end of 2009. In 2010, the company launched the Clearspring Audience Platform, a service for brand marketers to deliver interest-based display advertising across the web, which topped 1 billion unique users and was used by over 8 million unique domains. Clearspring acquired data science company XGraph in 2011.

It can be cooked in a pan or skillet on the stove top, under a broiler or using a pan in the oven. In its simplest form, it consists of a slice of bread, topped with American cheese and broiled until the cheese puffs up and browns. Variants include the addition of ingredients such as bacon, tomato, pineapple and eggs.

The Colombian national league ranks 9th in the IFFHS's ranking The Strongest National League in the World of 2014 (3rd in South America),. The Colombian national team represents Colombia in international football competitions. The highest rank it has ever reached in the FIFA World Rankings was third in 2013. It is currently ranked tenth in the world. Among the individual notable players that have emerged from the country are Ren√© Higuita, creator of the \\"Scorpion kick\\", Carlos Valderrama, Leonel √Ålvarez, Faustino Asprilla, Iv√°n C√≥rdoba, Mario Yepes, Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and James Rodr√≠guez. Colombian players have made an impact in the wider world game, notably in Europe in leagues like La Liga and in North America with Major League Soccer (MLS). Colombia had its strongest period during the 1990s, where they were among the giants in world football. A match during this period in 1993 resulted in a 5‚Äì0 win over Argentina which caused a special \\"mutual respect\\" rivalry between both nations. During this era, Colombia qualified for the 1990, 1994 and 1998 editions of the World Cup, only reaching the second round in 1990. At the 2001 Copa Am√©rica, √ìscar C√≥rdoba became the first and only goalkeeper in history to keep a perfect clean sheet in a Copa Am√©rica tournament. Football became an important part of the identity of Colombia as it fought the negative image of Colombia from the mid-1980s up to the present day. While Colombia has had ups and downs with the sport, football is still widely loved and supported. History Early years The origins of football in Colombia is debated by many. Most historians agree that the Caribbean Region was the place where football spread. It is believed that its origins go back to 1900, by English railway engineers from The Colombia Railways Company. The first clubs were formed in Barranquilla and Bogot√°: Barranquilla FC, Polo Club, Escuela Militar and Bartolinos, although the game took a while to develop in popularity. The 1918 Campeonato Nacional was the first tournament played between Colombian clubs, followed by the Copa Centenario Batalla de Boyac√°. Independiente Medell√≠n, founded on 15 April 1913, is the oldest club that remains as a professional club. It was not until 1924 that the Colombian Football Federation was formed, initially under the name Liga de F√∫tbol, that gained the affiliation with FIFA and CONMEBOL in 1936. El Dorado In 1948, a national league was created, known as Divisi√≥n Mayor del F√∫tbol Colombiano, formed largely from the efforts of administrator Alfonso Senior Quevedo. Outside the remit of FIFA due to contract problems, the league recruited a number of leading players, such as Alfredo Di St√©fano, Neil Franklin and Charlie Mitten, and gained the nickname \\"El Dorado\\". However, the period ended in 1954 after much of the money promised to the players failed to materialise Contemporary football In 1968, the league followed the pattern common in South America by splitting into two separate competitions per season, the Apertura (February to June) and the Finalizaci√≥n (July to December). In 1991, a second division was added to the first with a third, now defunct. With 16 titles, Atl√©tico Nacional is the team with the most trophies, followed by Millonarios with 15; both are the most successful clubs domestically. The Copa Colombia appeared in 1950, although this knockout competition was only contested from time to time until 2008 when it became an annual tournament. Atl√©tico Nacional is also the most successful club in this competition, with four wins. In 2017, the Colombian Women's Football League was founded. Santa Fe was the winner of the first edition. International The Colombia national team made their first appearance in 1938 and since then have enjoyed both highs and lows. Copa Am√©rica Colombia did not enter the Copa Am√©rica until the 1945 tournament when they finished fifth out of seven countries. Their participation was sporadic until 1975, a tournament in which they finished as runners-up, since when they have been ever-present. Colombia hosted the 2001 Copa Am√©rica and registered to date their only win in the competition, defeating Mexico 1‚Äì0 in the final. World Cup Colombia first entered the FIFA World Cup in 1938 but withdrew from the qualification tournament. They qualified for the 1962 finals but were eliminated in the first round. They returned to the tournament in 1990 and reached the second round with a team featuring the likes of Carlos Valderrama, Freddy Rinc√≥n and Ren√© Higuita. During qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Colombia impressed with some exceptional results, not least a 5‚Äì0 away win over Argentina, the losing finalists in the previous tournament. Such was their form that Pel√© tipped them as possible winners of the whole competition. However, the team were eliminated in the first round after Andr√©s Escobar scored a notorious own goal, an act for which an irate gambler shot him dead after his return home. Colombia returned to the competition in 1998 with expectations lowered, and once again they were eliminated in the first round. They did not qualify for a World Cup final again until the 2014 edition, ending a 16-year absence. Colombia has been credited with a new talented golden generation, led by James Rodr√≠guez, who won the Golden Boot for scoring six goals during the tournament as the Colombians reached their first quarter- final in a World Cup. Colombia qualified for the 2018 tournament, and came top of their group to proceed into the Round of 16. They were knocked out of the tournament by England; the game finished 1-1 before England won 4-3 on penalties. Confederations Cup As Copa Am√©rica winners, Colombia were able to take part in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in 2003. They qualified from their group before being eliminated by Cameroon and then losing the third place play-off to Turkey. Other teams The Colombian Football Federation runs a number of other teams, notably the under-20s (twice winners at the South American Youth Championship) and the under-17s (who won the South American Under-17 Football Championship in 1993). In 2014, Colombia was one of the eight nations to take part in the first Unity World Cup. It will hold the forthcoming edition of the competition, in 2017. Club football Two Colombian clubs have won the Copa Libertadores, leading Medell√≠n club Atl√©tico Nacional in 1989 and 2016 and little-fancied Once Caldas who triumphed in 2004, whilst Santa Fe became the first Colombian winners of the Copa Sudamericana in 2015. These are the only victories in any major international club tournament by Colombian sides.  Football in Colombian culture  Prior to 1980s, Colombian national football team was widely recognized as a weak team, and lack of fans, due to neglected investment for the national team by the Colombian Football Federation, national tragedies like La Violencia. Their lack of participation also added for this sporadic support, and despite having qualified for the 1962 FIFA World Cup, Colombian team remained underrated and under-achieved than the rest of South America, particularly to those of Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay outside traditional powers Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina, in spite of their youth football successes. Since the mid-1980s, with the influx of drug money into football, a new generation of football stars emerged, with Ren√© Higuita, Faustino Asprilla, Carlos Valderrama, Andr√©s Escobar and Arnoldo Iguar√°n. Following with it, the national team has become a symbol fighting the country's negative reputation. This has made the sport popular and made the national team a sign of nationalism, pride and passion for many Colombians worldwide. Colombia is known for having a passionate fan base, often attend in large number whatever the national team of Colombia play elsewhere.

The Memoria renovata, which dates to the reign of Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona over the Kingdom of Aragon, contains a genealogy of Arnau Mir. The author of the Memoria was dedicated to justifying the independence of the County of Ribagorza from both Aragon and Navarre and probably saw Arnau Mir as the strongest candidate with connexions to the old line of the counts of Ribagorza who could resist the regional hegemonic powers.Bisson, 298‚Äì99. In 1140, when William, Archbishop of Arles, acting as Papal legate, arbitrated the disputed boundary between the dioceses of Roda and Urgell, he did so \\"with the advice\\" (cum consilio) of Arnau Mir, who also signed the written agreement (convenientia) as a witness.Kosto, 106. Among the other magnates consulted for advice on this occasion were the Count of Pallars Sobir√†, Artau III, and Arnau's vassal Ramon Pere II d'Erill. Arnau held the city of Fraga as a vassal of Alfonso II of Aragon and Ramon Pere held it from Arnau.Kagay, 121‚Äì23. There is a surviving document recording the many disputes between Arnau Mir and Ramon Pere, but the record of their settlement (iuditium) is incomplete. There is also a record of the hostages Ramon posted as sureties. Among the crimes of which Arnau accused Ramon were: *stealing 990 sheep \\"within the boundaries of Fraga ... from the men of the Count of Pallars and the King\\" *capturing Arnau's vassal and \\"shield bearer\\", Berenguer de Benevent, and plundering his lands of assets valued at 995 gold florins *forcing Pere de Bardet, a vassal of Arnau, to become his vassal \\"under constraint\\" *refusing to render \\"fief service\\" to Arnau and his son, Raymond V, even though he was a liege vassal *defaulting on his debts to Arnau's other vassals *illegally confiscating fiefs worth 990 solidi in Vallebona and Bonausa *allowing his vassals to plunder the inhabitants of Val Benasc of 994 solidi Berenguer de Benevent had placed himself and his fief under the protection/authority/command of Arnau, so that he might act as a surety for Arnau and for Ramon d'Erill if Arnau required it. Arnau issued a special charter of protection for Berenguer, which Ramon broke. On Ramon's advice Arnau had established a fair at Casteglo (perhaps Castell√≥ d'Enc√∫s), but Ramon proceeded to establish a competing fair in his own territory and forbade his own men from attending Arnau's fair. When Arnau was going to confiscate Ramon's fief of Val d'Aran, the latter sent Ramon de Valsegne as a pledge to the count for the 1,000 solidi he owed. The latter Ramon was invested with Aran, but Ramon d'Erill took it from him and the \\"damage\\" to Arnau was 990 solidi. After Arnau was captured in war with Sancho VI of Navarre, he placed his \\"patrimony and vassals\\" under Ramon, who pledged to observe with them the same Truce of God he observed with his own vassals, Arnau pledged to respect Ramon's vassals the same way. During the period of Arnau's captivity, however, Ramon's vassals plundered Arnau and his vassals of 900 solidi in damages. In Lleida and Agramunt Ramon accepted a pledge from Ermengol VI of Urgell which he did not repay. Arnau was thus forced to agree with Ramon and Ermengol not to force the former to pay it and not to go himself or to allow his vassals to go to either Lleida or Agramunt. Arnau had disputes with his other vassals. It is recorded that one Berivizio wounded Pere de Castellnou, Arnau's liege vassal and nephew, and also murdered a man named Ros from Montanyana. Another vassal of the count, Ram√≥n de San Saturnino, stole twenty mules and asses from San√ß de Lirio. With his wife, Oria d'Enten√ßa, Arnau founded the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de la Gloria at Casbas de Huesca.

In addition, Tonner Doll Company Inc. contracts with and designs for many major film studios. They have designed dolls for such contemporary films as Harry Potter, Spider-Man 3, and Twilight, as well as classic films, such as Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. Robert Tonner has received national and international artistic awards and recognition including a permanent piece at The Louvre Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. He has also served as President of the National Institute of American Doll Artist (NIADA). Early life Robert Tonner was born as a twin, to a working-class family in Bluffton, Indiana. Martin Tonner, his father, was a self-educated engineer, and his mother, Virginia, a housewife. Robert has one older brother, John; his twin brother, David; and a younger sister, Mary.Finnegan, Stephanie. The Robert Tonner Story: Dreams and Dolls.Portfolio Press 2000 Tonner's mother Virginia was plagued with several illnesses throughout her life, including; epilepsy, encephalitis, cancer of the kidney and myasthenia gravis. The continual cost of his mother's health-care would lead to very low economic and family stability throughout Tonner's childhood. As a child, Tonner turned to drawing and television as an escape from the difficult home-situation. Programs such as The Mickey Mouse Club, The Wonderful World of Disney, Bonanza, Bewitched, as well as many comic book superheroes, such as the members of The Justice League, would be his greatest inspiration. At the age of eight, Tonner learned to sew. Tonner began his college career as a pre-med major, attending three different universities. However, in 1973 the struggling student abandoned his goal of becoming a surgeon and decided to pursue his true passion of becoming a fashion designer. That same year he would attend the Parsons School of Design in New York City. Fashion career In 1975, at the age of 23, Tonner was hired as the Personal Assistant to Don Sayres, a designer for Gamut, a sportswear company located in New York City. After three years with Gamut, Tonner accepted a position with fashion designer Bill Blass and was later asked to head the Blassport label. In 1983 Tonner launched his personal fashion label, \\"Robert Tonner for Tudor Square\\". After leaving the fashion industry, Tonner joined the National Institute of American Doll Artists (NIADA). He served as Standards chairman from 1991 to 1995 and was later elected President of NIADA 1995, a post which he held until 1997.Finnegan, Stephanie. The Robert Tonner Story: Dreams and Dolls. Portfolio Press 2000 Tonner launched Robert Tonner Doll Design (RTDD) in 1991 with his partner, Harris Safier. The first RTDD designs were introduced at the American International Toy Fair that same year. Backed by past connections within the NIADA and fashion design world, and the aggressive publicizing by Tonner's partner Harris, RTDD saw exponential growth within the first few years. In 2000, RTDD was renamed Tonner Doll Company, Inc. In 2006, Robert Tonner created the direct-marketing company Wilde Imagination, which built a collectible fashion doll design business based on Tonner's fictional character Ellowyne Wilde. Wilde Imagination continues to market direct to the consumer with new collections featuring Evangeline Ghastly and licensed pop-culture dolls based on The Wizard of Oz film. Recently, Tonner has returned to the world of fashion design with the introduction of the Robert Tonner 2010 Spring Collection, which debuted on September 9, 2009, at the Metropolitan Pavilion in New York City. Current activities Today, Robert Tonner resides in the Mid-Hudson River Valley town of Stone Ridge, New York with his family. An avid reader and pop-culture connoisseur, Tonner spends a great deal of time traveling for business. However, he much prefers the comforts of home, where one of his hobbies includes collecting original illustration art. Tonner is still the owner and director of Tonner Doll Company, Inc., while also working on his self-funded clothing line. He has also expressed interest in developing a line of toys for children. Still a member of NIADA, although no longer explicitly active, Tonner also belongs to the National Toy and Doll Collectors' Club in New York City, and is a sitting member of the Kingston Hospital Foundation in Kingston New York.

Nine days later 10 May 1535 Anabaptist uprising in Amsterdam occurred, after which Deelen was discovered to have met in secret with radical Anabaptist leaders including Jan van Geelen, although it is possible that Deelen's role was as a mediator.Trapman, J. \\"Delenus en de bijbel.\\" Nederlands Archief voor Kerkgeschiedenis 56 (1975): 95-113. In 1535 he fled to England, later becoming a librarian to Henry VIII, and working on a revision of the Latin New Testament of Erasmus. This he published under the Latin name Galterus Deloenus: Testamentum Novum Latinum in 1540. In 1550 Edward VI appointed Deelen and Marten Micronius (c.1522-1559) as preachers of the Dutch refugee congregation at Austin Friars. It seems likely that Deelen was acquainted with Immanuel Tremellius and his student Christopher Carlisle at Cambridge, and may have been present at the latter's debate with Sir John Cheke on the doctrine of harrowing of Hell in 1552, since he published sharing Carlisle's view on removing the doctrine from the creeds. Following the death of Edward VI (1553) aged 15, most of the Dutch, German and Polish Anabaptist community returned to the Low Countries. Deelen settled in Emden, Germany, where he worked with Jan Utenhove of Ghent on a translation of the New Testament into Dutch and edited the Dutch translation of reformation historian Johannes Sleidanus' De statu religionis commentarii. In 1559, a year after Elizabeth I succeeded Mary Tudor, Deelen returned to London, where he died in 1563.Mennonite Encyclopedia, Vol. 5, pp. 221-222.

Background  It is not known when Wang Shaoding was born. His family had been, prior to him, in control of Chengde Circuit for two generations, after his grandfather Wang Tingcou seized control of the circuit in 821 without imperial approval and eventually forced the imperial government to acquiesce; his father Wang Yuankui later succeeded Wang Tingcou and took a more conciliatory stance with the imperial government. Wang Shaoding was Wang Yuankui's oldest son. During Wang Yuankui's rule of Chengde, Wang Shaoding became deputy military governor, the commander of the Chengde troops, and acting commandant of Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture ().Old Book of Tang, vol. 142. When Wang Yuankui died in 855, the soldiers supported Wang Shaoding to succeed him. Then-reigning Emperor XuƒÅnzong initially made Wang Shaoding acting military governor, and, later in the year, full military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249.  As military governor  Wang Shaoding, however, was said to be inappropriate in his behavior, favoring drinking, and particularly liking to sling bullets at people from towers for fun. The soldiers became so displeased with him that they considered overthrowing him, but before they could do so, he fell ill and died in 857. The soldiers supported his younger brother Wang Shaoyi to be the new military governor, and Emperor XuƒÅnzong approved the succession and granted Wang Shaoding posthumous honors.New Book of Tang, vol. 211.

Carlile's denial of the descent into Hell had been anticipated by William Tyndale, and within his own lifetime was shared by Wouter Deelen (Gualterus Delenus) pastor of the Dutch church at Austin Friars, and another Hebrew scholar. Since Wouter Deelen had been first Hebrew professor at Amsterdam, and Tremellius was, at the time of the debate, professor of Hebrew at Cambridge, it is probable that both men were among Carlile's audience on the occasion. Tremellius and Deelen both left England when the young Edward VI died, aged 15, the next summer. They may have taken notes of the debate with them and published them in some form, or at least evidently some form of transcript of the debate must have found its way to Europe since ten years later Carlile found himself the joint target of a refutation by former Oxford scholar Richard Smyth (Regius Professor) (Louvain 1562), in a second section of a tract where Carlile had the honour of sharing the title with non-other than Jean Calvin.Refutatio luculenta crasse et exitiosae haeresis Johannis Calvini et Christo.

Patten was a politician from Queens, New York, USA. He was borough president of Queens for seven months in 1928 following the resignation of Maurice E. Connolly in April of that year. Life Patten arrived in the United States as an immigrant in 1900In his April 19, 1928 speech, Patten stated that \\"It is a great personal satisfaction to me to stand here and remember that twenty-eight years ago tomorrow I sailed up New York Harbor an immigrant boy.\\" when he was still a child. He was active in New York City and state politics, and held a number of elective and appointive offices in the twenty years before he became borough president. Patten was a member of the New York State Senate (2nd D.) from 1913 to 1916, sitting in the 136th, 137th, 138th and 139th New York State Legislatures. He was at times Queens Park Department Secretary, Deputy State Comptroller, and the city's Commissioner of Markets. Patten was named the Market Commissioner by Mayor Jimmy Walker on Connolly's advice. When Connolly resigned due to the ongoing Queens sewer scandals, Patten was elected by the Queens Democratic Party leadership to fill the rest of the term. He was well liked by the Queens leadership and an ally of Connolly, but Mayor Walker was thought to not be pleased with the selection, fearing the taint of the scandal would damage Democrats in the 1928 elections. Walker did not find time to administer the oath of office to Patten, which some political observers felt was a snub. Although he was popular with the party leadership, his election was protested by some civic organizations and other members of the public. Patten appeared before a grand jury to testify about the sewer scandal in Queens, but his appearance was voluntary and he was not indicted or subpoenaed. He easily won his party's nomination for Borough President in the election later that year, but he lost to Republican candidate George U. Harvey, who made fighting political corruption and Connolly's involvement in the sewer graft scandal central themes of his campaign. Patten ran again unsuccessfully for the nomination in 1929, though he was still popular with many in his party. The 1929 primary was hotly contested, and the party infighting was considered a factor in losing the race to Harvey and the Republicans. In order to ease relations and help unify the various factions among the Democrats, Mayor Walker named Patten to become the borough's Commissioner of Taxes and Assessment in 1930.

The dramatic, multicolored travertine walls of the spring have attracted attention from locals and tourists alike since the era of the Roman Empire. Hammam Maskhoutine is the historical name for this general area, also used to refer to the hot springs and the legend that named the town. Hammam Dbegh is the official name of the town itself, and Hammam Chellala is the name of the thermal complex and cascade.  History  During the Roman occupation, the town was called Aquae Thiblitanae, due to its proximity to Thibilis. The bath facilities installed by the Romans at the spring can still be used today. The Arabic name of the town comes from a local legend in which a man married his sister. As the wedding procession, including the incestuous couple, moved up the valley, a curse caused the skies to darken, and the entire wedding party was struck with lightning and turned to stone. The billowing shapes of the Hammam Maskhoutine spring are said to come from the still-frozen wedding party and their celebratory robes.  Hot springs  Hammam Maskhoutine is actually a group of 10 different hot springs in a single valley. The temperature of the water in the springs can be as hot as ; it is possible to boil eggs in the outflow channels. The overall flow rate of the thermal complex is 1,650 liters per second: nearly 100,000 liters per minute. The water is saturated with minerals such as iron and calcium carbonate. These minerals, as well as the heat, have been regarded as therapeutic for sufferers of ailments such as rheumatism and arthritis. On the site there are also numerous formations of conoid shapes.

The town of El Milia is located in the north-eastern Constantinois region. It lies between the cities of Jijel, Mila, Constantine BLOG EL MILIA DZ. and Skikda. The Mediterranean Sea is about twenty kilometers north of the town. The territory of the municipality of El Milia is located northeast of the province of Jijel. It is the largest city area of the region.  Administration  The municipality of El Milia is composed of one hundred and one localities, villages and hamlets. El Milia is the eponymous capital of El Milia District.  Population  According to the 2009 census it has a population of 80,000. The term used to refer to the Arabic-speaking highlanders in the region of El Milia was Kabyle hadra. The ethnic origin of these is that the first inhabitants of the region were the Kutama Arabs. In the 11th century, following the overthrow of the Fatimid empire and the fall of the Arab, a settlement was founded by various (especially Arab) who came from other regions of Algeria, particularly the highlands, and from Morocco. They moved to El Milia and its surroundings, but never mixed with Hilali Arab tribes, and later Muslim refugees from Andalusia expelled from Spain. There was also more recently a small Ottoman influx. Among the tribes that are in the city of El Milia and the region: Ouled Aidoun, Fergane Beni, Beni Belaid, Beni meslim, Tileman, Feteh Beni, Beni Aicha, Beni Khettab, Ouled Ali, Ouled Aouat, Ouled Boufaha, Mechat El Achache, Beni Caid, Ouled Mbareek, Telilane Beni and Beni Sbih.  History  Hills of El MiliaRoman North Africa El Milia takes its name from the ancient city and Roman bishopric (see below) Mulia. Home to many battles against French colonists, the region is one of the pillars of the war of independence and the fight against French colonial army. Only small, isolated mechtas existed in the area until 1860 when a small town was built, under the direction of the department of Constantine, in order to subdue the tribe of Ouled Aidoun. Under the French occupation the area was part of Kabylia East. Together with the new town came a borj (fortress) to control the Ouled Aidoun. The tribe, humiliated and ruined by new taxes, held a meeting and decided to attack the next day at dawn and take control of the French military tower. This revolt of February 14, 1871 marked the beginning of a general armed uprising (the Mokrani Revolt) in eastern Kabylie. The uprising that took place in two phases lasting about 9 months, during which the French camp was destroyed, and the tower besieged for over a week. The French occupation forces then mobilized some 10,000 soldiers to try to quell the uprising, and their superiority in armaments gave them the upper hand. In retaliation against the population, the French imposed additional taxes, confiscated land and enacted arrests and deportations. During the War of Independence, the tribes of the region of El Milia, then part of the historic wilaya II of North Constantine, played a large role in the fight against the settlers, particularly in the attacks of 20 August 1955. On that day and the days that followed, the French colonial troops suffered huge losses. This impelled Youcef Zighoud to declare \\"If we lost militarily and won politically in north-eastern Constantine, that is to say in Skikda and its periphery, I can tell you that we won both militarily and politically in the northwest of Constantine, particularly in El Milia. \\"  Ecclesiastical history  Mulia was among the many towns in the Roman province of Numidia, in the papal sway, that were important enough to become a suffragan diocese. It only historically documented bishop was Peregrinus, participant at the synod called at Carthage by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom in 484, after which he was exiled like most Catholic bishops, unlike their heretical Donatist counterparts. Morcelli list a second Latin bishop (in 393), whom Mesnage and Jaubert assign to the diocese of Mutia.

In 2003, Otterson was also the LDS Church's main point man in its response to Jon Krakauer's book on Mormonism, Under the Banner of Heaven. ‚Äì article on the Under the Banner of Heaven debate In 2005 Otterson downplayed John M. Haddow's attempt to make the exclusion of Mormons from the National Prayer Breakfast connected with the National Day of Prayer into an issue of concern.. He was engaged as early as 2006 in positioning the church as politically neutral in relation to Mitt Romney running for president and once wrote an article in which he argued that Romney's religion should be a non- issue. He also was very vocal in stating that the LDS Church would give no institutional support to Romney. In 2008 Otterson confirmed that Proposition 8 was one of the initiatives the LDS Church had been most heavily involved in. In late 2009 Otterson gained national attention by making an official statement for the LDS Church in the Salt Lake City Council meeting in favour of city ordinances that included sexual orientation and gender identity among categories covered in fair housing and fair employment regulations. A year later, on 12 October 2010, he delivered an official statement for the church on bullying of gay young men. Otterson has a regular blog published by the Washington Post on Mormon-related issues. Among topics he has addressed is the 2011 The Book of Mormon musical on Broadway.  Writings  Besides periodical columns and various articles, Otterson is the author of Finding Your Family on the Internet: The Ultimate Guide to Online Family History Research ().

Early life  Lukin was born at Launceston, Tasmania on 21 November 1840, son of the brewer George Lukin and his wife Mary Anne, n√©e Wilkins.  Career  Lukin followed his elder brother George Lionel Lukin to Queensland in 1865, where he came to work as a clerk and public servant. He became chief clerk of the Queensland Supreme Court in 1871 but resigned in November 1873 after purchasing a third share in the Brisbane Newspaper company. Although Lukin took on the position as editor-in-chief of the Brisbane Courier, he was in fact working as the journal's 'managing editor', only occasionally being engaged in the practical editing and writing. The old Irish radical, William Augustine O'Carroll, was the de facto daily editor of the Courier during Lukin's entire period as managing editor. Yet Lukin was instrumental in consolidating the company's assets, the Brisbane Courier and its weekly The Queenslander, following a period of great and devastating turmoil in this journal's history. The Queenslander was the subject of Lukin's special and primary attention, he managed to turn this journal from being a simply weekly summary of its mother journal, to become a quality literary weekly engaging some of the best artist and writers available in the colony, writers such as William Henry Traill, Carl Feilberg, poets and writers such as James Brunton Stephens and writers of short stories such as \\"Redspinner\\" William Senior, Dick Newton, Horace Earle and many others, engaging eminent artists such as the illustrator Henry Houghtons, not to mention the drawers and painter Joseph Augustine Clarke to design the front pages and decorate certain columns of The Queenslander. Lukin's period as part proprietor and managing editor came to an abrupt end in December 1880, following failed mining speculations and a personal bankruptcy in late 1879 which he only just managed to overcome in April 1880, following losses from which he would never fully recover. Lukin left Queensland but returned briefly in the late 1880s purchasing and afterwards editing William Lane's old journal The Boomerang from 1890 to its closure in 1892. Lukin's seven years period of as managing editor of the Brisbane was crucial for the consolidation of the Brisbane Courier's position as Queensland's leading journal. Lukin gained an additional lasting reputation as a Queensland pioneer of compassion following his commissioning of Carl Feilberg to run a nine-month-long newspaper campaign for Aboriginal rights and against the colony's frontier policy and native police system in the Queenslander from March to December 1880, a campaign the key articles of which was turned into a famous pamphlet entitled 'The Way We Civilise; Black and White' in December 1880, as one of Lukin's last acts as managing editor of the Brisbane Newspaper Co.  Later life  Lukin died at Wellington, New Zealand on 12 September 1916.

There was agreement that a school was necessary to accommodate the tiny international community and East Timorese families requiring English language education. A resident Australian family, Tony Haritos and Carmel Bates, took up the organisational and funding challenge and in February 2003 Dili International School commenced operations as a multi-age primary school. Later that year in May, a Preschool class was created. A Playgroup was formed in June 2004, providing a much needed early childhood facility. Two years later in January 2006, the school expanded to include a Distance Education Support Program for students in secondary grades and a specialist Secondary English as a Foreign Language class. Enrollments continued to increase until the 2006 East Timorese crisis, which saw a decline in numbers as families left East Timor either voluntarily or at the urging of their employers and governments.

It traditionally described a playmaking type of 12 with good passing and kicking skills as opposed to the strong hard runner and tackler in that position providing less game-management and attacking options. Some second five-eighths such as Sonny Bill Williams and Ma‚Äôa Nonu, however, combine aspects of both styles of play. Etymology The 1903 All Black captain, Jimmy Duncan, is credited with coining the name five- eighths when he decided to take a player from the forwards to add to the backs. The backs at that time consisted of two half-backs, three three- quarters, and a full-back. As the additional player stood between half-back and three-quarters, Duncan came up with the term five-eighths according to the fraction between them. The player at five-eighths, also known as the five- eighth, could take the ball back to the forwards or pass it on to the three- quarters. This backline innovation occurred before the split between rugby union and rugby league in Australia and New Zealand and the term is now commonly used for the five-eighth position in rugby league football. As the game of rugby union evolved, the two half-back positions acquired separate functions. The outside half-back, now known as the outhalf or fly-half, became the first five-eighths in New Zealand under the two five-eighths system. The next player on his outside was called the second five-eighths. The terms first-five and second-five are sometimes used as abbreviated versions of first five-eighths and second five-eighths, respectively.

Funding for the project, organized by his sons, Torcuato and Guido Di Tella, was raised using the United States model of corporate financing, as well as by the donation of 10% of the SIAM Di Tella corporation's public stock. Its objective was initially limited to an arts program revolving primarily around the display of the Di Tella family's private collections, which prominently included works by Henry Moore, Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Jackson Pollock.Instituto Di Tella: Promoci√≥n del arte.

Guido Di Tella would serve as president, and the post of director of the institute was offered to Enrique Oteiza, whose family were leading Pampas-area landowners. The foundation also received funding in the form of grants from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, after which the modest initiative expanded into theater and music, and grew to become the most significant cultural institution in Buenos Aires of the 1960s. The institute continued to influence prevailing trends in the history of Argentine culture, however, and it adopted and advanced a modernist trend in various artistic disciplines. Its audiovisual center, established in 1960, and directed by Roberto Villanueva, premiered with a play, El Desatino (The Folly). The production's scenery backdrops were projected through slides, and introduced audiences to Nacha Guevara and Les Luthiers. This format would be promoted in subsequent years for its ability to broadcast material through compact and portable media in a way that would stimulate a network of local groups active in the cultural field. The Torcuato Di Tella Institute at Florida Street during its heyday in the 1960s Following its establishment, the Di Tella art collection was transferred to the foundation, and Jorge Romero Brest hosted a free show at the National Museum of Fine Arts, which the leading local art critic directed. The activities were transferred to a small office in the Museum of Fine Arts in August 1960, and this was followed by an annual award for national and international artists, many of which sold their works to the Di Tella collection. As part of the awards program, the winners were awarded scholarships covering study abroad and an exhibition of works in a North American or European gallery. Growing local interest in Latin American art was accompanied by an initiative to show the Di Tella collection across the Argentine hinterland, for which a minibus was purchased in 1963; the experiment, however, ended the following year, when the vehicle crashed in a rural La Rioja road. Patrons venture into La Menesunda, Marta Minuj√≠n's famed 1965 \\"happening\\" at the institute. An initiative by Guido Di Tella led to the institute's relocation into a modern, newly completed Florida Street building in August 1963. The offices were rented by SIAM Di Tella at the northern end of Florida Street, near Plaza San Mart√≠n, a busy pedestrian intersection in the upscale Retiro district that could attract larger audiences. The building was refurbished with the addition of three stage theatres, and interiors designed to be inviting, with a floor- to-ceiling glass panel fa√ßade featuring publicity photos taken by Humberto Rivas, and a large lobby. The modern, air-conditioned building was propitious for exhibits and artistic events year-round. Its caf√©, like the gallery, was staffed by attendants who wore no uniforms, and allowed patrons to smoke and take photographs at their leisure. Founded by classical composer Alberto Ginastera, CLAEM (the Latin American Center for Advanced Musical Studies) was made part of the institute in 1962, yielding numerous productions of dodecaphonic, electronic, and acoustic music; CLAEM attracted prominent international guest lecturers such as Aaron Copland, Luigi Nono, and Iannis Xenakis. A visual arts center (CAV) was also inaugurated at the new address. Directed by Romero Brest, CAV became the leading Buenos Aires center for the display and promotion for avant-garde creations. CAV introduced art patrons to sculptors Juan Carlos Dist√©fano, Julio Le Parc, and Clorindo Testa, as well as painters Romulo Macci√≥, Luis Felipe No√©, Jorge de la Vega, Ernesto Deira, Antonio Segu√≠, and conceptual artists such as Edgardo Gim√©nez and Marta Minuj√≠n. The latter garnered interest after earning the institute's first National Award in 1964, and became known for her \\"happenings.\\" Erotic in some aspects, and provocative to conservative local audiences, her early Di Tella Institute events included Er√≥ticos en technicolor and the interactive Revu√©lquese y viva (Roll Around in Bed and Live). She then joined Rub√©n Santanton√≠n in 1965 to create La Menesunda (Mayhem), where participants were asked to go through sixteen chambers, each separated by a human-shaped entry. Led by neon lights, groups of eight visitors would encounter rooms with television sets at full blast, couples making love in bed, a cosmetics counter (complete with an attendant), a dental office from which dialing an oversized rotary phone was required to leave, a walk-in freezer with dangling fabrics (suggesting sides of beef), and a mirrored room with black lighting, falling confetti, and the scent of frying food. The use of advertising throughout suggested the influence of pop art in Minuj√≠n's \\"mayhem.\\" Clar√≠n (7/6/2005) Cover designed by Juan Carlos Dist√©fano for the institute's 1967 exhibition of Julio Le Parc's refracted photography Already established as the leading local center for pop art, the Di Tella Institute also became a forum for art as political commentary. This was dramatized by what became the center's most contentious display, sculptor Le√≥n Ferrari's La civilizaci√≥n occidental y cristiana (Western-Christian Civilization), in October 1965. The work displays Christ crucified not by the traditional cross; but by a fighter plane, as a symbolic protest against the Vietnam War.Argentina Xplora: El Instituto di Tella An \\"experience\\" at the Di Tella, where experimental theatre became a 'happening' for hapless audiences. A turn of historical events in 1966 proved detrimental to the institute, and to freedom of expression, when the civilian administration of President Arturo Illia was deposed on June 28 by the Argentine Armed Forces, and was replaced with the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a. Moderate in comparison with many of his counterparts in other Latin American nations, Ongan√≠a was, however, a member of the right-wing Catholic power group, Opus Dei, and as such, found many of the developments in Argentine culture during the 1960s offensive.Hutchison, Robert. Their Kingdom Come: Inside the Secret World of Opus Dei. St. Martin's Press, 1997. Sharing his distaste for modern culture was Luis Margaride, whom he named head of the Federal District Police, and who would be remembered for his crusades against nightclubs, long hair, and miniskirts.Andersen, Martin. Dossier Secreto. Westview Press, 1993. Facing a government policy backdrop such as this, numerous avant-garde artists (and others, particularly in academia) left Argentina, many never to return.Crawley, Eduardo. A House Divided: Argentina 1880-1980. St. Martin's Press, 1985. A self-styled manzana loca (city block of madness), the center's agenda remained active initially, and this new era was marked by the advent of the \\"Experience\\"a fusion of the more controversial happenings with experimental theatre.P√°gina/12 (5/24/1998) The decline in audiences and contributions, as well as the SIAM Di Tella Corporation's own, mounting financial problems, led to the curtailment of most of its activities by 1969, however. The Ford Foundation continued to support the institute, though these grants were contractually limited to social studies. The director, Enrique Oteiza, and two leading board members, Jorge S√°bato and Roberto Cort√©s Conde, resigned, and in May 1970, the famed Florida Street center hosted its last exhibition, a theatrical production by Maril√∫ Marini. The foundation was bankrupt, and only the sale in 1971 of numerous works from its collection of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque art to the federal government for 2.1 million pesos (US$500,000), staved off its liquidation. Remembered nostalgically by friends of the arts, and particularly during the \\"Dirty War\\" of the late 1970s, when repression of political terrorism quickly extended to dissidents and controversial artists, the institute's absence became an example of the \\"cultural blackout\\" described by writer Ernesto S√°bato at the time.Jord√°n, Alberto. El Proceso. Emec√© Editores, 1993. Following President N√©stor Kirchner's appointment of Torcuato Di Tella (jr.) as Secretary of Culture in 2003, the idea of reviving the storied center was first plausibly discussed by the president of the board of regents of Torcuato Di Tella University, Manuel Mora y Araujo.Clar√≠n (2/24/2007) Much of the 1960s-era documentation and numerous works had been stored by the library at the university, the Di Tella family's surviving contribution to local culture, and the material's recataloguing was initiated in 2004. New facilities were developed that year from a former water company building by one of the center's alumni, sculptor and architect Clorindo Testa,La Naci√≥n (8/25/2004) and on April 21, 2007, the institute's center for visual arts was reinaugurated at the Figueroa Alcorta Avenue location with the Otro Modo (Another Way) Festival. Continuing to host media and conceptual art displays, the institute celebrated its 50th anniversary in March 2008.Clar√≠n (3/7/2008) External links *Universidad Torcuato di Tella *UDT: Fondo Centro de Artes Visuales archives References Category:Arts foundations based in South America Category:Culture in Buenos Aires Category:Avant-garde art Category:1958 establishments in Argentina ","title":"Torcuato di Tella Institute"},{"id":"26075661","text":"Badabadda is a small town in Sri Lanka.

Following Bennett's baptism, Napol√©on Spitz, the head of Bennett's team, held a meeting in which he said his team would stop Sunday play and all football teams in that division agreed to move games to weeknights. Bennett was also a police officer in Tahiti. He is the father of Naea Bennett, who also played for Tahiti national team.Article from Richard Vansam, in France Football, n¬∞1.855, 27 october 1981, page 23.

It began as a practical and comfortable variation of clothing, such as the t-shirt and the bikini, but would later become fashion statements that would be controversial and accused of being provocative. 21st century versions include the display of thongs and bras in women's clothing, and the display of underpants under low-slung pants in men. Wearing underwear as outerwear has historical antecedents in the display of undergarments in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  History  It is unclear when this officially began as a fashion trend, however, Chanel unveiled womenswear made from jersey in the 1920s, a fabric that was usually used for undergarments. Notoriously, another notable edition was the invention of the t-shirt, which became popular outerwear after the Second World War. Short-sleeve shirts were originally intended to be a comfortable alternative to Victorian undergarments but teenagers began to wear them as outerwear, due in part to James Dean and Marlon Brando's characters frequently wearing them in the movies Rebel Without a Cause and the A Streetcar Named Desire respectively. Swimwear, such as the bikini, have a history in originally being used as underwear pre-Renaissance, and slip dresses were first widely worn in the last decade of the 20th century, when they were made from layered chiffon, polyester satins and charmeuse, and often trimmed with lace. Madonna on stage during the Blond Ambition World Tour (1990) In entertainment, underwear-like outfits are often the uniform for wrestlers and circus performers; former DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz revealed that this was the reason why superheroes like Superman wore underpants on top of their outfits. Madonna has been credited for making lingerie a popular outfit for female music artists on stage (e.g. Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Katy Perry) when Jean-Paul Gaultier designed corsets (\\"an emblematic symbol of fashion in the early 90s\\"),San Martin, Macarena (2011).

B1). The sexual liberation movement of 1968 began the re- appropriation of the corset as a symbol of rebellion and \\"sexual perversity\\" by young women associated with London‚Äôs punk and Goth subcultures. This re- appropriation allowed a symbol historically associated with female oppression, to become reconceived as a symbol of sexual empowerment in fashion. Outside of underwear fetishism, the corset made an appearance in evening gowns and wedding dresses.Crane, Diana. ‚ÄúPostmodernism and the Avant-Garde: Stylistic Change in Fashion Design.‚Äù Modernism/Modernity, 4, (1997), 123-140.  Sportswear  The t-shirt would eventually become a part of sportswear fashion with unique designs from many fashion brands. Sports bras were first invented in 1975, and women have been wearing them under other clothing since then, but in 1999, Brandi Chastain scored the fifth kick in the penalty shootout to give the United States the win over China in the final game of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, and she spontaneously whipped off her jersey in celebration, exposing her sports bra. Her act is regarded by some as a historical event that boosted the wearing sports bras on their own. From that point forward, sports bras have increasingly been worn as outerwear.  Cultural reception  Office colleagues in Mexico City participating in 2015's No Pants Subway Ride. Society often portrays the public in underwear as surrealist and comedic: No Pants Day is an annual event held in various Western countries, where people publicly wear only underwear and leave their legs exposed. No Pants Subway Ride is a similar event to promote public wearing of underwear on subway trains. Another such event is Undie Run, where people run on the street wearing only their underwear. The popularity of low- rise pants in the 21st century led to the unintentional trend of the whale tail among young women who aspired to wear something \\"rump-flattering\\", whereas sagging among young men and teenage boys became extremely controversial to the point of American towns demanding that it should be banned for indecency. However, the whale tail trend ended by the end of the 2000s and led to a rise in high-waisted clothing. Menswear never experienced a similar backlash, and men who wore high-waisted were ridiculed for wearing Dad jeans; underwear companies took note on men's preference of wearing their trousers at the hips because low-rise pants sat lower than underwear and caused non-sagging men to expose their underwear waistband, so they exploited it through designing waistbands with bright colors and larger logos. Calvin Klein Underwear chief creative designer Bob Mazzoli explained in 2009, \\"Instead of a functional component, the waistband is a marketing platform and a canvas for real design [...] Seeing somebody with jeans that fall just below the waist to the point where the underwear shows is part of our cultural vernacular [and] it's something we consider in the design process.\\" 2(x)ist's creative director Jason Scarlatti added: \\"It‚Äôs bragging rights for the customer. It says, ‚ÄòI paid good money for this.‚Äô\\" Jockey underwear, credited as one of the first underwear brands to print its logo on waistbands, unveiled an advertizing campaign in 2013 that featured models holding up their shirts to show the Jockey waistband exposed above their jeans and shorts.

O'Carroll was the son of a ship's captain and born in a family bakery In Patrick Street, Cork, Ireland. He joined the Fenians in 1858 and was a contributor to the Nationalist journal Irish People for which he subsequently became the editor. He left Ireland, allegedly with 'a prize on his head' following the failure of the 'St Patrick Plot' and he subsequently migrated to Brisbane with his family by the Chatsworth in 1862. O'Carroll gained a reputation in Queensland as the author of a series of articles to the Queensland Guardian newspaper, critical of the Irish immigration as conducted by the agents of its primary promoter, the Catholic Bishop of Queensland James O'Quinn. He joined the Guardian staff and from that time onwards O'Carroll's history was bound up with that of journalism in Queensland. He joined the staff of the Brisbane Courier following the collapse of the Guardian but a struggle for the political line amongst that journals shareholders subsequently caused him to form the small liberal-oriented journal the Colonist in conjunction with Robert Travers Atkin (1841‚Äì1872). This effort was severely halted by the premature death of Atkin in 1872, yet O'Carroll carried on this effort for some time as a tri-weekly under the name The Express, yet he eventually sold to the company who bought up to launch what became the Brisbane Telegraph newspaper. He then joined the staff of the new part-owner of the Brisbane Courier, Gresley Lukin in November 1873 and remained in the position of 'sub-editor' on that journal throughout Lukin's managing proprietorship which lasted to 21 December 1880. Yet although Lukin retained the position as editor, and to some extent discharged the duty of that office, O'Carroll was from the beginning entrusted with a large share of the editorial responsibility. It was stated at his death that O'Carroll had been the 'de facto editor' of the Brisbane Courier onwards from the mid-1870s and remained in that position right through to September 1883, when the new managing proprietor Charles Hardie Buzacott appointed Carl Adolf Feilberg as editor-in-chief of the Brisbane Courier and its weekly the Queenslander. O'Carroll was buried in the Roman Catholic section of Toowong Cemetery which was attended by approximately 500 people.

The Concordy based its report on eyewitness testimonies from students. The students claimed Sweeney had acted openly intoxicated and behaved inappropriately, making hostile remarks towards one female about her political affiliations. Cell phone photographs also surfaced after the incident and were included in the Concordy's coverage. Co-editors- in-chief Matt Smith and Alla Abramov made the decision to run the story based on a lack of denial from Sweeney's camp. With the help of former editor-in- chief Joanna Stern, Smith and Abramov faxed copies to local Albany newspapers. That weekend, the story was picked up by major newswires and ran across the country. The New York Times gave the story full coverage and ran the cell phone photos that had appeared in the Concordiensis. Delta Delta Delta, 2011 In October 2011, the Concordiensis ran several pieces concerning a campus investigation into a Delta Delta Delta sorority party. Copies of one issue were stolen en masse from distribution boxes and thrown in the trash. The story was picked up by the Student Press Law Center and by College Media Matters, organizations that track national college press issues. References Bibliography # Somers, Wayne, ed (2003).

Early life and education  Now living on Chicago's northwest side, Richards is a native of Chicago's South Shore and West Beverly neighborhoods, Richards graduated from Columbia College Chicago.http://www.wgntv.com/about/station/newsteam/deanrichards/  Professional career  Richards began his career in radio in 1975, holding a variety of jobs in Chicago at stations like WLTD (now WCGO), WMRO and WAUR, Aurora; WFYR (now WKSC-FM), WCFL (now WMVP), WIND (AM) and WCLR. In 1984, he also did voiceover work for WPWR-TV Channel 60. From 1985 until 1990, he doubled as operations manager and morning host at the Satellite Music Network, which was based in Chicago's southwest suburbs. In 1990, Richards joined WNUA in Chicago as a weekend and substitute radio host. In May 1991, Richards remained at WNUA, but took a job as a staff announcer at WGN-TV. In July 1991, Richards was promoted to become WNUA's morning host after its previous morning host, Yvonne Daniels, died. In the summer of 1994, Richards' contract was not renewed at WNUA. Almost immediately after leaving WNUA, Richards became a fill-in radio host at WGN (AM) in Chicago. In December 1994, the station gave him a Sunday afternoon program of his own. In the spring of 1995, Richards was promoted to become WGN's production director, primarily overseeing production of radio commercials. By October 1995, Richards was given a Saturday afternoon shift at WGN as well. In 1998, Richards successfully persuaded Chicago officials to rename a portion of Addison Street in Chicago near the WGN-TV studios after Bob Bell, who had played Bozo the Clown on WGN-TV from 1960 until 1984. In January 1999, Richards debuted as a Sunday morning radio host on WGN. In January 2000, Richards began delivering weekly theater reviews on noon newscasts WGN-TV in Chicago. At the time, Richards was also a part of the regular rotation of hosts of Illinois Lottery drawings, which take place at the WGN-TV studios. In 2001, Richards switched to delivering his weekly theater reviews on WGN-TV's morning newscasts. In 2004, Richards began covering show business for WGN-TV, including conducting hundreds of celebrity interviews. In January 2010, Richards' production duties were cut at WGN-AM radio.  Mel Gibson incident  On January 29, 2010, WGN-TV aired an interview that Richards conducted with actor Mel Gibson via a remote feed about his new movie, Edge of Darkness, and then queried Gibson about how the public perceives him, given his noted drunken outburst and anti-Semitic rant while being arrested in 2006. The line of questioning annoyed Gibson, who told Richards, \\"That's almost four years ago, dude. I mean, I've moved on. I guess you haven't.\\" After the interview, Gibson‚Äîunaware that the camera was still rolling and that he was still on air‚Äîtook a sip of coffee and used the term \\"asshole,\\" presumably directed at Richards. Gibson and his publicist both later claimed that the remark was directed at Gibson's publicist; a remark later proven false by insiders who were in the studio with Gibson at the time.  Awards  Since joining WGN-AM, Richards has won over 30 local and national awards for programming and production.  Personal  In September 2007, Richards faced a cancer scare when he had his thyroid gland removed. Richards has been a long-time supporter of Gilda's Club, a support organization for cancer survivors founded by Gene Wilder, the husband of comedian Gilda Radner. Since the early 2000s he has given over one week of his radio show a year to support the organization and to share with and tell the stories of Gilda's Club members.

History The Preserve is located on the former cattle ranch of Andrew Brown, which dates to the 1860s. The ranch was bought by The Nature Conservancy in 1979 and the deed transferred to National Audubon Society in 1998.http://kern.audubon.org/about.htm About the Kern River Preserve Pioneer Andrew Brown Andrew Brown was born in Ireland in 1829, arrived in California in 1852, and eventually settled in Kern County. He operated a general store in Kernville, and expanded into Weldon township with the purchase of a second store and a ranch. Brown raised cattle, sheep, hogs and wheat. He built a flour mill in Weldon and later a sawmill near what is now Wofford Heights. Business success enabled Brown to purchase and trade for other ranch and farm land, and he incorporated all his interests into the A. Brown Company in 1901. Brown was company president until his death in 1909. The Brown family continued operations until the 1970s.Morgan, Wallace Melvin, History of Kern County, California, with biographical sketches of the leading men and women of the county who have been identified with its growth and development from the early days to the present. 1914 pp 213-214 when the heirs sold the Brown Ranch to the Kern County Land and Cattle Company. Development of the property was a possibility, however, The Nature Conservancy moved quickly to purchase of the ranch. The purchase was accomplished in 1979 with funds from donors, two of which were Getty Oil Company and the W. M. Keck Foundation. Expansion of the preserve The Nature Conservancy acquired adjacent acreage through a program of land trades which swapped pasture land parcels for riparian forest parcels with nearby Sprague Ranch and the Prince Ranch in 1980. The preserve now bordered the Army Corps of Engineers' (now Sequoia National Forest) South Fork Wildlife Area on the west and the eastern end of Lake Isabella where the South Fork Kern River enters the reservoir. In 1981, a fence was constructed to protect the streamside vegetation from grazing cattle. On March 31, 2005, Audubon California chapter and California Department of Fish and Game bought of the Sprague Ranch. The purchase was in part to mitigate for the flooding of the South Fork Wildlife Area from Lake Isabella during high water years and resulting loss of willow flycatcher habitat. A total of was added to the preserve, the remaining of Sprague Ranch went to California Department of Fish and Game. Funding was provided by US Army Corps of Engineers; California Wildlife Conservation Board; and the National Audubon Society from a grant from the Packard Foundation's Conserving California's Landscape Initiative.Audubon California \\"Sprague Ranch now part of the Kern River Preserve\\" On January 31, 2006, the purchase of of the Alexander Ranch that flanks the South Fork Kern River was completed with funds from the Resources Legacy Foundation. The riverfront property has nesting sites of vermilion flycatchers, yellow warblers, Bullock's orioles and southwestern willow flycatcher. The land is in good condition, with ponds of duckweed and other wetland plants that harbor several pond turtles.KRP Friends of the Preserve newsletter winter/spring 2006. pp1-2 There were two land acquisitions in 2009: On August 28, the Vig property was purchased by Audubon, and November 20, the Pond Ranch sale closed a gap between Fay Ranch Road and Sierra Way Road. The Pond Ranch purchase added one-quarter mile of the South Fork Kern River frontage to the preserve Cattle and conservation In addition to real estate purchases, the Audubon California organization continues to work with private land owners in the South Fork Valley on conservation issues. Bruce Hafenfeld, of the California Cattlemen's Association, operates a family ranch raising commercial calves and cows on both private property and public lands on a federal grazing allotment. Hafenfeld has entered into a perpetual conservation easement with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly Soil Conservation Service) to ensure the property is maintained as a working ranch. \\"We developed a management plan for 1.3 acres along the Kern River Preserve, went after a wetland reserve grant, and developed habitat that increased opportunities for species to come onto my land. We were trying to show that we were not a liability, but an asset.\\" Hafenfeld said, speaking at the 2007 Conference of the Riparian Habitat Joint Venture.

Although the valley was the first area settled in the county, it contains the largest contiguous riparian forest still remaining in the state. There are several types of riparian forest, the South Fork Valley has the Great Valley Cottonwood Forest, distinguished by a majority of Fremont cottonwood and willow tree species. The understory is dense with wild rose and shade-tolerant Oregon ash. The soils are fine-grained alluvial with annual river flooding that maintains fertility. The University of California, Santa Barbara's Biogeography Lab report describes the distribution of this type of riparian forest as \\"Formerly extensive along the major low-gradient (depositional) streams throughout the Great Valley, but [are] now reduced to scattered, isolated remnants or young stands because of flood control, water diversion, agricultural development, and urban expansion...\\"UCSB Biogeography Lab Gap Project, Great Valley Cottonwood Forest(61419) Rare wildflowers include the alkali mariposa lily.

The summer tanager will remove the bee's stinger before ingesting by rubbing the bee on a branch.Cornell Lab of Ornithology,All About Birds Summer Tanager The least Bell's vireo is a species that will hopefully reestablish nesting in the South Fork Kern River Valley. It is one of four subspecies of Bell's vireo, which disappeared from California's Central Valley by the 1960s, and has been federally listed as endangered since 1986. USFWS Species Profile The US Fish and Wildlife Service's 5-year review of least Bell's vireo, dated September 2006, attributes the primary cause of population declines to loss of riparian habitat in California. Another threat listed by the review is from the brown- headed cowbird which lays its eggs in other birds' nests, called brood parasiteism. The Southern Sierra Research Station, which conducts research on the Kern River Preserve, has a cowbird eradication program which has reduced the rate of parasitism to 20 percent from 60 to 70 percent (percentage of willow flycatcher nests studied by Southern Sierra Research Station staff).USFWS 5-year Review Least Bell's Vireo Mammals, amphibians, reptiles and insects Common mammals include mule deer, coyote, dusky-footed woodrat, long-tailed weasel, California ground squirrel, American black bear, and bobcat. Uncommon species include mountain lion and an introduced species of beaver. There are 50 species of mammals Mammals on the Kern River Preserve found on the Kern River Preserve. There are three species of amphibians Amphibians of the Kern River Preserve and 24 species of reptiles, Reptiles of the Kern River Preserve including the common garter snake, California kingsnake, several lizard species and the California toad. The only venomous snake at the preserve is the Northern Pacific rattlesnake. Also found at the preserve is the Pacific pond turtle, a species of concern in California and listed as endangered in Washington state. The South Fork Valley is unique in California, as three of the ten floristic provinces in the nation meet and overlap here. The floristic provinces are: Great Basin Desert, Mojave Desert, and Californian Province (in which one finds numerous ecotypes: grassland, riparian forest, oak woodland, interior chaparral, mixed conifer, sequoia, red fir, subalpine.) The resulting diversity is evident in the numbers of species: There are 31 species dragonfly, Dragonflies on the Kern River Preserve of and 53 species of butterfly, including the alkali skipper (grass skipper) and the rare San Emigdio blue butterfly. San Emigdio blue butterfly The San Emigdio blue butterfly is a species of concern due to its limited local range consisting of Southern California from Inyo County south through the Mojave Desert, San Joaquin Valley, Bouquet and Mint canyons of Los Angeles County.Butterflies and Moths of North America Scientific research Grinnell Resurvey Project Joseph Grinnell was one of the founding directors of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley from 1908 until his death in 1939. Grinnell undertook a biological survey project in 1908, which lasted 30 years and covered more than 700 locations in the state of California. The resulting database has more than 20,000 specimens, 13,000 pages of field notes, and 2,000 photographs. The Grinnell Survey database is one of the most comprehensive collections of its kind in the world.Berkeley Science Review magazine, Issue 10 \\"Back to Nature- Revisiting the 1914 survey of California Wildlife\\". A resurvey of Grinnell's original route was begun by the museum to research, document and model changes in the distribution and habits of animal species in the timespan between the early 1900s and the current century. The Kern River Valley area, called the Whitney transect, was studied in June and September 2008 and in May 2009 by the resurvey teams. The original Grinnell 1911-1914 field notes are online and searchable. (See External links section.) Parts of the resurvey of California are completed, including Yosemite National Park, and show changing trends in wildlife territory and range; some expanding, some contracting and some species moving to higher elevations. Other research A subspecies of the Pacific (western) pond turtle is the southern Pacific pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata pallida). A project for headstarting pond turtle hatchlings on the preserve began in 2006 with grants from the Fish and Wildlife Foundation. As of July 2010, 17 juvenile turtles were released from captivity. This process is known as headstarting, where hatchlings are raised in captivity until they are large enough to avoid predators and then released to the wild.Southern Pacific Pond Turtle Project, Audubon California The Southern Sierra Research Station, a non-profit organization, conducts research at the preserve on the western yellow-billed cuckoo and southwestern willow flycatcher.Southern Sierra Research Station website.

Diarmaid_Mac_Murrough as depicted in the Expugnatio Hibernica, ca. 1189 Topographia Hibernica (Latin for Topography of Ireland), also known as Topographia Hiberniae, is an account of the landscape and people of Ireland written by Gerald of Wales around 1188, soon after the Norman invasion of Ireland. It was the longest and most influential work on Ireland circulating in the Middle Ages and its direct influence endured into the early modern period. Background The author was born about 1146 within the aristocratic FitzGerald/de Barri family in the castle of Manorbeer in Wales with the birth name of Gerald de Barri. Gerald made his first visit to Ireland in 1183 and returned in 1185. His first visit, to see members of his family who had played a prominent role in the Angevin invasion of the country in 1169, was not more than a year long. His second visit was undertaken at the command of King Henry II, in the company of the king's youngest son, Prince John, and lasted from 25 April 1185 to Easter 1186. All of his writings were in Latin and have been translated into English. Based on the evidence of the Topographia, it would appear that Gerald's travels within Ireland were not extensive. He spent most of this first visit in Waterford and Cork. During his second visit, he visited Dublin, Wicklow, Meath, Kildare and, possibly, Athlone and Lough Derg. Whether or not he visited some of the places he mentioned or he simply related tales he heard from others is debatable. He wrote about the island of Inishglora, off the coast of the Mullet Peninsula, Erris, that corpses on that island do not putrefy and that generations of people all in a state of perpetual 'freshness' were to be seen on that island.Wright, T.

From British Library Royal MS 13 B VIII. The work is divided into three parts. The first primarily deals with the landscape, flora and fauna of the country; the second with the miracles and marvels of Ireland and the third with the history of the people and their culture.Topography of Ireland The work reflects the breadth of Gerald's learning and interests. He claims to have based his book primarily on his own observations and on reliable eyewitness testimony rather than on written sources. Among the few written works that he used was the Irish Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn. Quotations Distinction 1 (Of the situation in Ireland) Chapter XI Of barnacles, which grow from fir timber, and their nature *\\"There are likewise here many birds called barnacles,(barnacle geese) which nature produces in a wonderful manner, out of her ordinary course. They resemble the marsh-geese, but are smaller. Being at first, gummy excrescenses from pine-beams floating on the waters, and then enclosed in shells to secure their free growth, they hang by their beaks, like seaweeds attached to the timber. Being in progress of time well covered with feathers, they either fall into the water or take their flight in the free air, their nourishment and growth being supplied, while they are bred in this very unaccountable and curious manner, from the juices of the wood in the sea-water. I have often seen with my own eyes more than a thousand minute embryos of birds of this species on the seashore, hanging from one piece of timber, covered with shells, and, already formed. No eggs are laid by these birds after copulation, as is the case with birds in general; the hen never sits on eggs to hatch them; in no corner of the world are they seen either to pair or to build nests. Hence, in some parts of Ireland, bishops and men of religion make no scruple of eating these birds on fasting days, as not being flesh, because they are not born of flesh, But these men are curiously drawn in error. For, if anyone had eaten part of the thigh of our first parent, which was really flesh although not born of flesh I should think him not guiltless of having eaten flesh. Repent, O unhappy Jew, recollect, though late, that man was first generated from clay without being procreated by male and female; nor will your veneration for the law allow you to deny that. In the second place, woman was generated of the man, without the intervention of the other sex. The third mode of generation only by male and female, as it is the ordinary one, obstinate as you are, you admit and approve. But the fourth, from which alone came salvation, namely, birth from a woman, without union with a man, you utterly reject with perverse obstinacy, to your own perdition. Blush, O wretched man, blush! At least recur to nature, which in confirmation of the faith for our best teaching, continually produces and gives birth to new animals without union of male and female. The first creature was begotten of clay; this last is engendered of wood. The one, proceeding from the God of nature for once only, was a stupendous miracle; the other, though not less admirable, is less to be wondered at, because imitative nature often performs it. But, human nature is so constituted, that it holds nothing to be precious and admirable but what is uncommon and of rare occurrence. The rising and setting of the sun, than which there is nothing in the world more beautiful, nothing more fit to excite our wonder, we pass by without any admiration, because they are daily present to our eyes; while an eclipse of the sun fills the whole world with astonishment, because it rarely occurs. The procreation of bees from the honeycomb, by some mysterious inspiration of the breath of life, appears to be a fact of the same kind (as the origin of barnacles)\\" Distinction II (Of the wonders and miracles of Ireland) \\"Chapter XII Of an island which at first floated, and afterwards was firmly fixed by means of fire. *\\"Among the other islands is one newly formed, which they call the phantom isle, which had its origin in this manner. One calm day, a large mass of earth rose to the surface of the sea, where no land had ever been seen before, to the great amazement of the islanders who observed it. Some of them said that it was a whale, or other immense sea-monster; others remarking that it continued motionless, said, \\"No, it is land\\". In order therefore to reduce their doubts to certainty, some picked young men of the island determined to approach near the spot in a boat. When however, they came so near to it that they thought they should go on shore, the island sank in the water and entirely vanished from sight. The next day it re-appeared, and again mocked the same youths with the like delusion. At length, upon their rowing towards it on the third day, they followed the advice of an older man and let fly an arrow, barbed with red-hot steel, against the island; and then landing, found it stationary and habitable. This adds one of many proofs that fire is the greatest of enemies to every sort of phantom; insomuch that those who have seen apparitions fall into a swoon as soon as they are sensible of the brightness of fire. For fire, both from its position and nature is the noblest of elements, being a witness of the secrets of the heavens. the sky is fiery; the planets are fiery; the bush burnt with fire, but was not consumed; the Holy Ghost sat upon the apostles in tongues of fire\\".Wright, T. The Historical works of Giraldus Cambrensis (1913) London The reader here must wonder if Gerald got, not only to the far western islands of Ireland, but as far as Iceland where he witnessed (or heard about) the (volcanic) birth of an island 'born' in the 12th century (like an early Surtsey!) \\" Chapter XX Of a woman who had a beard, and a hairy crest and mane on her back *\\"Duvenald, king of Limerick, had a woman with a beard down to her navel, and also, a crest like a colt of a year old, which reached from the top of her neck down her backbone, and was covered with hair. The woman, thus remarkable for two monstrous deformities, was, however, not an hermaphrodite, but in other respects had the parts of a woman; and she constantly attended the court, an object of ridicule as well as of wonder. The fact of her spine being covered with hair, neither determined her gender to be male or female; and in wearing a long beard she followed the customs of her country, though it was unnatural in her. Also, within our time, a woman was seen attending the court in Connaught, who partook of the nature of both sexes, and was an hermaphrodite. On the right side of her face she had a long and thick beard, which covered both sides of her lips to the middle of her chin, like a man; on the left, her lips and chin were smooth and hairless, like a woman\\" \\" Chapter LII (Of the mill which no women enter) *\\"There is a mill at Foure, in Meath, which St. Fechin made most miraculously with his own hands, in the side of a certain rock. No women are allowed to enter either this mill or the church of the saint; and the mill is held in as much reverence by the natives as any of the churches dedicated to the saint. It happened that when Hugh de Lacy was leading his troops through this place, an archer dragged a girl into the mill and there violated her. Sudden punishment overtook him; for being struck with infernal fire in the offending parts, it spread throughout his whole body, and he died the same night\\". Distinction III (On the inhabitants of this country) \\"Of the character, customs and habits of this people\\" * Chapter X \\"I have considered it not superfluous to give a short account of the condition of this nation, both bodily and mentally; I mean their state of cultivation, both interior and exterior. This people are not tenderly nursed from their birth, as others are; for besides the rude fare they receive from their parents, which is only just sufficient for their sustenance, as to the rest, almost all is left to nature. They are not placed in cradles, or swathed, nor are their tender limbs either formented by constant bathings, or adjusted with art. For the midwives make no use of warm water, nor raise their noses, nor depress the face, nor stretch the legs; but nature alone, with very slight aids from art, disposes and adjusts the limbs to which she has given birth just as she pleases. As if to prove that what she is able to form, she does not cease to shape also, she gives growth and proportions to these people, until they arrive at perfect vigour, tall and handsome in person, and with agreeable and ruddy countenances. But although they are richly endowed with the gifts of nature, their want of civilisation, shown both in their dress and mental culture makes them a barbarous people. For they wear but little woollen, and nearly all they use is black, that being the colour of the sheep in all this country. Their clothes are also made after a barbarous fashion. *Their custom is to wear small, close-fitting hoods, hanging below the shoulders a cubit's length, and generally made of parti-coloured strips sewn together. Under these, they use woollen rugs instead of cloaks, with breeches and hose of one piece or hose and breeches joined together, which are usually dyed of some colour. Likewise, in riding, they neither use saddles, nor boots, nor spurs, but only carry a rod in their hand, having a crook at the upper end, with which they both urge forward and guide their horses. They use reins which serve the purpose both of a bridle and a bit, and do not prevent the horses from feeding, as they always live on grass. Moreover, they go into battle without armour, considering it a burthen (burden) and esteeming it brave and honourable to fight without it. *But, they are armed with three kinds of weapons: namely, short spears and two darts; in which they follow the customs of the Basclenses (Basques); and they also carry heavy battle axes of iron, exceedingly well-wrought and tempered. These they borrowed from the Norwegians and Ostmen of when we shall speak hereafter. But in striking with the battle-axe they use only one hand, instead of both, clasping the haft firmly, and raising it above the head, so as to direct the blow with such force that neither the helmets which protect our head, nor the platting of the coat of mail which defends the rest of our bodies, can resist the stroke. Thus, it has happened in my own time, that one blow of the axe has cut off a knight's thigh, although it was encased in iron, the thigh and leg falling on one side of his horse, and the body of the dying horseman on the other. When other weapons fail, they hurl stones against the enemy in battle with such quickness and dexterity, that they do more execution than the slingers of any other nation. *The Irish are a rude people, subsisting on the produce of their cattle only, and living themselves like beasts ‚Äì a people that has not yet departed from the primitive habits of pastoral life. In the common course of things, mankind progresses from the forest to the field, from the field to the town and to the social conditions of citizens; but this nation, holding agricultural labour in contempt, and little coveting the wealth of towns, as well as being exceedingly averse to civil institutions ‚Äì lead the same life their fathers did in the woods and open pastures, neither willing to abandon their old habits or learn anything new. They, therefore, only make patches of tillage; their pastures are short of herbage; cultivation is very rare and there is scarcely any land sown. This want of tilled fields arises from the neglect of those who should cultivate them; for theirs are large tracts which are naturally fertile and productive. The whole habits of the people are contrary to agricultural pursuits, so that the rich glebe is barren for want of husbandmen, the fields demanding labour which is not forthcoming. *Very few sorts of fruit-trees are found in this country, a defect arising not from the nature of the soil, but from want of industry of planting them; for the lazy husbandman does not take the trouble to plant the foreign sorts which would grow very well here. Two of them are fruit-bearing trees, the chestnut and the beech; the other two, the arulus (or alarus ‚Äì unsure of variety) and the box, though they bear no fruit, are serviceable for making cups and handles. Yews, with their bitter sap, are more frequently to be found in this country than in any other I have visited, but you will see them principally in old cemeteries and sacred places, where they were planted in ancient times by the hands of holy men to give them what ornament and beauty they could. The forests of Ireland also abound with fir- trees, producing frankincense and incense. There are also veins of various kinds of metals ramifying in the bowels of the earth, which, from the same idle habits, are not worked and turned to account. Even gold, which the people require in large quantities and still covet in a way that speaks their Spanish origin, is brought here by the merchants who traverse the ocean for the purposes of commerce. They neither employ themselves in the manufacture of flax or wool or in any kind of trade or mechanical art; but abandoning themselves to idleness, and immersed, in sloth, their greatest delight is to be exempt from toil, their richest possession, the enjoyment of liberty. *This people then, is truly barbarous, being not only barbarous in their dress but suffering their hair and beards to grow enormously in an uncouth manner, just like the modern fashion recently introduced; indeed, all their habits are barbarisms. But habits are formed by mutual intercourse; and as these people inhabit a country so remote from the rest of the world and lying at its furthest extremity, forming is it were, another world, and are thus excluded from civilised nations, they learn nothing and practise nothing, but the barbarism in which they are born and bred and which sticks to them like a second nature. Whatever natural gifts they possess are excellent, in whatever requires industry they are worthless\\". All these passages are taken directly from this source Wright. T. The Historical Works of Giraldus Cambrensis (1913) London Gerald appears to have added to the work throughout his life with the result that four principal versions of the text have come down to us. The final recension is almost twice as long as the first. Reception The work was dedicated to King Henry II in 1187, two years before his death. Soon after King John's accession to the throne, the author published a revised edition, which he dedicated to the new king.Wright, The historical works of Giraldus Cambrensis (1913) pp. 171 ‚Äì 178 The work is known to have been read to Archbishop Baldwin of Exeter by Gerald while both were travelling in Wales to preach the Third Crusade in March 1188. By Gerald's own account, Baldwin thought very highly of the work. It may have been read publicly at Oxford in 1187, and it was certainly read there in sometime around 1188. Gerald notes in his autobiography, De Rebus a se gestis, that he read the work on three successive days, one part of the book being read on each, before a great audience. He claims that the public readings were intended to recall \\"ancient and authentic times of the poets\\". The work enjoyed much wider popularity in manuscript than Gerald's second work on Ireland, Expugnatio Hibernica. Vernacular translations of the work or of parts of it were produced throughout Europe. Influence Gerald's influence was such that even in the 17th century, commentators such as Geoffrey Keating noted that all foreign commentators on Ireland wrote \\"in imitation of Cambrensis\\". Among the 16th- century luminaries who were familiar with the work and drew upon it in their own writings were John Leland, John Bale, Abraham Ortelius, Henry Sidney, Philip Sidney, Edmund Campion, Hooker, Holinshed, Hanmer, William Herbert and William Camden. Camden produced the first full printed edition of the work at Frankfurt in 1602. The text is generally acknowledged to have played a key role in shaping early British attitudes to the Irish.Irish Times Criticism Gerald's depiction of the Irish as savage and primitive was challenged and refuted by a number of Irish writers. The 17th century saw the production of several prominent attacks on Gerald, including Cambrensis Eversus (1662) by John Lynch, and works by Geoffrey Keating, Philip O'Sullivan Beare, and Stephen White.

Pope Barbara Spyridon Pope (born 1951) was United States Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) from 1989 to 1993. She came to prominence during the Tailhook scandal for her opposition to the initial investigation conducted by Rear Admiral Duvall M. Williams, Jr., which she felt was a whitewash. Biography Barbara S. Pope was born in Pittsburgh on November 10, 1951. Pope attended Vanderbilt University, graduating with a B.A. in 1972. She attended George Washington University 1978-80, and worked as an administrative assistant in the Small Business Administration's Office of General Counsel 1979-80. She was an employee development specialist in the Small Business Administration's Office of Personnel 1980-82, and then served as Special Assistant to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration 1982-86. In 1986, Pope became Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Family Support, Education, and Safety) in the United States Department of Defense. On August 19, 1989, President of the United States George H. W. Bush nominated Pope as Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs), and, after ratification by the United States Senate, Pope served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) from November 1989 until January 1993. When the Tailhook scandal broke in 1991, Pope became concerned that the United States Department of the Navy was not conducting a proper investigation into allegations that United States Navy personnel had sexually harassed women at the 1991 meeting of the Tailhook Association in Las Vegas. She was particularly concerned because the officer heading the investigation, Rear Admiral Duvall M. Williams, Jr., head of the Naval Investigative Service, made sexist remarks in Pope's presence, most notably a comment that he believed that \\"a lot of female Navy pilots are go-go dancers, topless dancers or hookers\\".Melissa Healy, \\"Pentagon Blasts Tailhook Probe, Two Admirals Resign,\\" Los Angeles Times, Sept. 25, 1992 When Admiral Williams issued his final report, finding that no senior Navy officials bore responsibility for what occurred in Las Vegas, Pope went to United States Secretary of the Navy Henry L. Garrett III and told him that she would resign if the United States Department of the Navy did not \\"do another report and look at what we needed to do about accountability and responsibility and the larger issues at hand.\\"William H. McMichael, The Mother of All Hooks: The Story of the U.S. Navy's Tailhook Scandal (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Publishers, 1997), p. 273. Garrett agreed with Pope, and a further investigation was conducted, headed by Derek J. Vander Schaaf, the Inspector General of the United States Department of Defense, that ultimately resulted in the resignation of Admiral Williams, and a second admiral, Rear Adm. John E. Gordon, for their failure to conduct a thorough investigation into the Tailhook allegations.Melissa Healy, \\"Pentagon Blasts Tailhook Probe, Two Admirals Resign,\\" Los Angeles Times, Sept. 25, 1992 In the wake of Vander Schaaf's report, the Naval Investigative Service was reorganized as the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. In the wake of the Tailhook scandal, Pope chaired an ad hoc committee to study the role of women in the military. In the course of this study, she said that \\"As we looked at assimilation and integration of women, combat exclusions and how we do business, it was clear women had been made to feel like second-class citizens.\\" This committee played a role in United States Secretary of Defense Les Aspin's 1993 order ending the ban against female combat pilots and his decision to ask the United States Congress to allow women to serve on American navy ships. Pope later became Assistant Secretary of State for Civil Rights under United States Secretary of State Colin Powell. Powell tasked Pope with moving to combat discrimination in the United States Armed Forces.Tanya N.

In 1840, Sanchez married Encarnacion Ortega (1824-1894), the daughter of Quentin Ortega and Vicenta Butron of Rancho San Ysidro. The first rancho Sanchez bought was Rancho Las Animas from the widow of Mariano Castro in 1835. Sanchez was granted Rancho Llano de Tesquisquita in 1835.Marjorie Pierce,1981, East of the Gabilans, Western Tanager Press, In 1844 Sanchez bought Rancho Lomerias Muertas from Jose A. Castro.

Boston Galerie d'Orsay hosted an exhibition with a selection of the museum works for the artist in 2005. The documentary \\"Swimming Through the Clouds\\", about the artist's life and work, was screened at a number of film festivals around the world and broadcast by Link TV, a culture and arts satellite network. His work is featured in corporate and public collections, including Bakersfield Museum of Art, Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Estrella- Banner Medical Campus in Phoenix, Four Seasons Hotel in the Bahamas, Genzyme International in Boston, Harvard University at the Offices of Neuro-Science Department, Las Vegas International Airport, Miramax Films, Mitsubishi- Shiodome Project in Tokyo, 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Toyota USA Headquarters in Torrance, and Iris A. Walsh Foundation in Winnipeg. The artist collaborated with composer and musician Charlie Haden and created the artwork for Haden's 2005 Grammy award-winning CD Land of the Sun. His collaboration with Hollywood's film industry has led to a number of film and television projects, including Spider-Man, Bringing Down the House, Erin Brockovich, Simone, Shopgirl, American Dreamz, Spider-Man 3, Fracture, and Boston Legal.

He developed and improved the wax paper process and his photographs are recognised for their composition and use of shade. He was an early practitioner of the operation of ovariotomy (ovarian cystectomy) where his published results were amongst the best in the world.  Early life and education  Thomas Keith was born in St Cyrus, Kincardineshire in 1827, one of seven sons of Rev. Dr. Alexander Keith, a Church of Scotland minister, one of the 450 who broke away to form the Free Church of Scotland, an event known as the Disruption of 1843. Rev Keith took an early interest in photography travelling with his elder son George Skene Keith (1819-1910) to the Holy Land in 1844 where he took daguerreotype views of notable places in Syria.Ritchie LA. Keith, Alexander (1792‚Äì1880), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/ 15262 This early family interest in photography when it was still in its infancy was undoubtedly a major stimulus to the photographic career of Thomas Keith which began some eight years after the expedition of his father and brother to the Holy Land. Keith's mother, Jane Blaikie (1793‚Äì1837), was the sister of Sir Thomas Blaikie, the Scottish magistrate. Three of Thomas Keith's brothers entered the medical profession. Thomas Keith was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and the Royal High School, Edinburgh then studied at Marischal College, Aberdeen where he qualified MA. His medical training took place entirely in Edinburgh.  Early Surgical Career  In 1848, at the age of 21 he graduated MD from the University of Edinburgh and was appointed house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh to James Syme (1799‚Äì1870), the Professor of Surgery. This appointment was to last for fifteen months and it was during this time that he learned from Syme the principles of surgery which were to form the basis of his future success. It was from Syme that he came to appreciate the importance of absolute cleanliness in the surgical wound and meticulous attention to detail, particularly with haemostasis. Their respect was mutual. When Syme's wife became ill, Syme, who could have chosen any surgeon in the land to attend her, chose Keith. Keith was succeeded as house surgeon by the young Joseph Lister, and the two remained friends for life. Before starting in practice in Edinburgh, Keith spent two years in Turin as a surgeon to a family friend, the Hon Ralph Abercromby, British resident minister (ambassador) at the Court of Victor Emmanuel II, the King of Sardinia (and later first King of a united Italy).Obituary. Thomas Keith. Edinburgh Medical Journal 1895; 41: 484‚Äì488. On return to Edinburgh, Keith passed the necessary examination and was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. (FRCSEd) He then went into medical practice with his brother George Skene Keith (1819‚Äì1910) in Great Stuart Street. George had studied medicine in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, qualified MD in 1841 and become FRCPE in 1845.Obituary. George Skene Keith. British Medical Journal 1910; 1: 237‚Äì238. In that year he became assistant to Professor James Young Simpson, Professor of Midwifery at the University of Edinburgh. On 4 November 1847, Simpson with George Keith and his other assistant James Mathews Duncan (1826‚Äì1890), (another photographic enthusiast), conducted the famous experiment at 52 Queen Street, Edinburgh during which the trio discovered the anaesthetic effects of chloroform.Obituary. George Skene Keith. Lancet 1910; 1: 275‚Äì276. Thomas Keith came to specialise in gynaecology and in 1862 performed his first ovariotomy (excision of ovarian cyst) but in the years 1853‚Äì56 he devoted much of his time to photography.  Photographic career  The leading pioneers of photography in Scotland included David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson whose many calotypes included a portrait of Thomas Keith's father, Rev. Alexander Keith. This early contact with them, and with the other photographic pioneers Sir David Brewster and Dr James Brewster, had stimulated Rev. Keith and his son George to learn how to produce daguerreotypes. This in turn initiated Thomas Keith's interest.Hannavy, J. (2015). The Victorian photographs of Dr. Thomas Keith and John Forbes White. Wlltshire. John Hannavy Publishing He was a founding member of the Photographic Society of Scotland. In his photography Thomas Keith used the waxed paper process developed by Gustave Le Gray (1820-1884), which he simplified and improved. His work showed great artistic skill and a mastery of the chemistry involved. These included a series of intricate chemical processes including waxing the paper before iodising it with a solution of potassium iodide and other chemicals, then sensitising it to light with a solution of silver nitrate and acetic acid. Keith published the details of his modification of le Gray's technique in Photographic Notes in 1856, noting that the original technique was ‚Äònot suitable for our climate‚Äô. He describes various changes he tried in the chemical solutions, in timing and in temperature, all carefully recorded along with their effects on the final image. This account shows his meticulous attention to detail and his willingness to innovate and experiment. He often shared his photographic excursions around Edinburgh with his brother-in-law John Forbes White. Because of the pressures inflicted by his medical practice, Keith did not continue with photography after 1856, but by this time he had created a priceless photographic record of nineteenth-century Edinburgh and images of Dysart in Fife and Iona. Keith's prints and negatives are held by a number of institutions including the Edinburgh Central Library, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Scottish Academy, the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, the Canadian Centre for Architecture, George Eastman House, Harry Ransom Center  Later surgical career  After 1856 Keith devoted himself to surgery and in particular to the then new and controversial procedure of ovariotomy. The first documented successful performance of this procedure was by Ephraim McDowell (1771‚Äì1830) in Kentucky in 1809. McDowell had studied surgery in Edinburgh under John Bell (1763‚Äì1820) who described the operation but never performed it. Bell's successor in Edinburgh John Lizars (1787‚Äì1860), was sent McDowell's account and he performed the first successful ovariotomy in Britain, publishing the results in 1825.Lizars J. Observations on the extraction of diseased Ovaria; illustrated by plates. Edinburgh: Daniel Lizars, 1825. Surgeons like Charles Clay (1801‚Äì1893) in Manchester and Thomas Spencer Wells (1818-1897) in London began to perform the procedure regularly, but the mortality rate was so high that mainstream medical opinion felt that it was too dangerous to perform. Keith performed his first ovariotomy in 1862, having learned the technique from Spencer Wells. From the outset he recorded his results in detail. His early mortality rate was consistently lower that of other published series like Spencer Wells Keith further reduced the mortality rate to 4% when he began to use antiseptic technique, taught to him by his lifelong friend Joseph Lister. The leading American gynaecologist J. Marion Sims (1813‚Äì1883) visited Keith to find the ‚Äòsecret‚Äô of these remarkable results and concluded that Keith's meticulous attention to detail was largely responsible for his ‚Äòsuccess which so outstripped that of all other operators, that it became a wonder and admiration of surgeons all over the world.‚Äô Keith gained a worldwide reputation. He began to perform the hysterectomy procedure, again with low mortality compared to other published series. In 1888 Keith moved to London, living at Charles Street, Berkeley Square. His reputation was such that he was consulted by eminent people such as Lady Randolph Churchill (1854-1921), but his years here were dogged by ill health. The congenital cystinuria, which had caused him to pass urinary calculi from childhood and had required operations, now caused a renal abscess which drained by his son and surgical partner Skene Keith (1858‚Äì1919. He attributed some of his health problems to the large quantities of bicarbonate which he took to combat the condition and his repeated exposure to antiseptic agents may also have been a factor in his death at the age of 67. He died early on the morning of Wednesday, 9 October 1895 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. On 4 June 1854 he had married Elizabeth Johnston, first cousin to Jessie (n√©e Grindlay) wife of Sir James Young Simpson, and they had had six children, all of whom survived him.

It was intended, in part, to be SDS for Southerners and SNCC for white students at a time when it was dangerous for SDS to attempt to organize in the Deep South and when SNCC was starting to discuss expelling white volunteers. It was felt that students at the traditionally white and black colleges in the South could be more effectively organized separately than in an integrated student civil rights organization; however, this was controversial and initially opposed by advisors like Anne Braden. Sue Thrasher and Archie Allen of the Christian Action Fellowship were among the founders of the group, with the support of Bob Moses and others. At its inception, the group had close ties to controversial Louisville, Kentucky radicals Carl and Anne Braden and their organization, the Southern Conference Education Fund,Ernst, John and Baldwin, Yvonne. \\"The not so silent minority: Louisville's antiwar movement, 1966-1975\\" Journal of Southern History (February 2007). Retrieved April 24, 2010. but a deliberate effort was later made to put some distance between the SSOC and the Bradens to avoid the appearance that the SSOC was a Communist front. After its founding, SSOC came to be formally tied to the SDS as a fraternal organization with a regional mandate in the South, and joint SDS-SSOC chapters existed at some schools like the University of North Carolina. A monthly organ,The New South Student, was published on a regular basis. In 1967, SSOC organizers led by Gene Guerrero and Lynn Wells, worked with TWUA on a unionization drive in North Carolina textile mills, involving more than 300 students in the campaign. In 1968, Gene Guerrero and Howard Romaine were among the SSOC activists involved in founding Atlanta's widely circulated underground newspaper, The Great Speckled Bird. SSOC considered itself a distinctly Southern organization and sometimes embraced traditional Confederate symbols and language. In 1968, SSOC staged a series of antiwar protests called \\"Southern Days of Secession,\\" in which they urged Southerners to \\"secede\\" from the Vietnam War. The SSOC button was a Confederate flag with black and white hands shaking in front of it. The hands were modeled on a handshake between SSOC organizer Archie Allen and SNCC chairman John Lewis. It was designed by an artist on the SNCC staff. SSOC had an extensive literature program, printing thousands of copies of pamphlets on civil rights, the Vietnam war, poverty and campus reform that were sold on campus literature tables across the south. The bestseller was entitled \\"Vietnam: The Myth and Reality of American Policy.\\" During the school year, it published a monthly magazine called The New South Student. One of the magazine's features was a series called \\"The Roots of Southern Radicalism\\", which featured stories on historic predecessors of SSOC back to slave revolts, the American revolution, the abolition movement, the Populists, the union organizing drives of the 1930s, and institutions and organizations like Highlander Center, Koinonia Farms, and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare. SSOC also organized a conference in Atlanta on Radical Southern History. SSOC had four chairmen during its five- year history: Gene Guerrero, Howard Romaine, Steve Wise, and Tom Gardner. During its last year, it changed the post to two secretaries, Mike Welch and Lyn Wells, and added a newspaper called The Phoenix, to SSOC's list of publications. SSOC leased the historic camp at Buckeye Cove in Swannanoa, North Carolina from the Fellowship of Southern Churchmen and held many conferences there. SSOC conferences had a variety of topics but were a way for southern activists, who often felt isolated on the conservative and largely segregated campuses of the time to meet like-minded students from other places and draw strength and inspiration from their activities. Through a traveling teach-in on Vietnam and American foreign policy that toured southern states between 1967 and 1969, SSOC helped to organize the antiwar movement in the south. The appearance of SSOC delegations at national antiwar marches always resulted in enthusiastic applause. **ADDING(7/30/20)!Information on our SSOC Chapter at Emory University & in Atlanta.** By Emily E.

We knew at our protests (certainly at this one), there was often surveillance, harassment, & some had been followed. So we all decided together on the strategy that the line behind the casket would be diverse but include enough white protesters(including myself) in especially visible roles.(One of our stated SSOC goals was to show whites actively against racism.) Anyone deciding to protest could also chose to thread in & among the crowd, handing out our protest leaflets. \\\\- We held a huge teach-in event ‚ÄúConversation: Vietnam‚Äù at Emory.

Eventually we collaborated with some members in the progressive Emory‚Äôs Methodist Wesley Fellowship Student group on demonstrations. (I was a member though not Methodist.) Before Emory SSOC got fully together, I had volunteered for GA Rep. Julian Bond (who had finally gotten seated!)to canvas door-to-door for Bond, to the white residents in his predominantly Black district. Most of the white residents were poor or low-income, many in public housing. They did not support Bond, many openly racist. Bond knew they would not open their doors to a black person. But he wanted their views too on issues affecting his District. So white students in pairs fanned out in the white neighborhoods. Many were still hostile & refused to answer Bond‚Äôs short questionnaire. But- quite a few were SO surprised that Bond had gotten us white volunteers because he wanted their views too. They said things like ‚ÄúI thought that N*word wouldn‚Äôt care a damn about us.‚Äù And they participated. And several had very real conversations with us. I learned a LOT about grassroots work from that. **NOTE: I have a few SSOC documents & papers I saved with items from Emory. ‚Äî ALSO: -I vaguely remember Gene Guerrero at some joint planning meetings & events, but no specifics.

SSOC always sent at least two members. When we arrived on the campus, Harlon & I were intercepted (by campus security or police) & taken to an Administrator‚Äôs office. He said ‚ÄúWe were informed you were coming. What exactly are you doing on our campus.‚Äù He was very suspicious & accusatory. That was a big surprise! Emory SSOC had wondered in general it there might be an informant in one of our groups -since by then Hoover‚Äôs efforts to infiltrate & undermine Civil Rights & Peace/Anti-Vietnam War activist groups were well known. But we didn‚Äôt distrust anyone in particular. So Emory SSOC had decided that in our strategizing & coalitions, we just would never agree to do anything against our values. At that moment in Valdosta, obviously someone had tipped them off. They knew who to stop. We repeated that we‚Äôd been invited to come. I was angry & I always good at thinking on my feet. In this case, when the Valdosta State official kept asking us suspicious questions, I told him I had volunteered to come because I was familiar with Valdosta, that I was born there, and that my family in Macon visited often, since my Aunt & Uncle (my Daddy‚Äôs brother) lived there. He clearly did not believe me. I said I‚Äôd give him my Aunt Virginia‚Äôs phone number if he wanted to call. I said I hadn‚Äôt told my Aunt I was coming, because there wouldn‚Äôt be time to go by & see her since it was such a long drive from Atlanta down to Valdosta to meet & then back. But he was welcome to verify who I am with her. Valdosta was small then, & my Aunt was the ‚ÄúLadies Page‚Äù Editor of the local paper, & in the Garden Club. I think he did call my Aunt & she did confirm all that. I really laid it on (though careful not to exaggerate) about ‚Äúmy Daddy‚Äôs people being from Valdosta, & me ‚Äúnot being an outsider.‚Äù Finally they let us leave & then meet with the students later than planned. Harlon & I had a really good laugh about me surprising the Valdosta State official & taking him off guard. And we described it all to our SSOC members at Emory & GA State when we got back **ADDING(7/30/20)!Information on our SSOC Chapter at Emory University & in Atlanta.** I am Emily E. Culpepper. I was a member & activist with SSOC when I was an undergraduate at Emory University, Decatur, GA. Our Emory SSOC chapter had graduate students & undergraduates. We had a very active chapter & joined often with activists & groups from Morehouse, Spelman, GA State University in Atlanta, Atlanta University, and SNCC. - In various collaborative coalitions, we held many demonstrations (handing out leaflets) against the Vietnam War in downtown Atlanta. We held Stand Against the War silent vigils on the Emory Cafeteria steps especially on Sundays, because nearby church goers also ate there. \\\\- A major success was our protest demonstration against the inauguration of infamous racist Lester Maddox as Gov.of GA.- during his inauguration in a public park. This got on National TV Networks(eg, CBS, I think). One of our SSOC goals was to show the public that many white Georgians also protested against racism along with Civil Rights groups, including SNCC. At the head of our lines was a Black draped full-size casket, with a large Georgia State Seal - above its GA Motto, we had written large letters ‚ÄúHere lies[SEAL with MOTTO|‚ÄòWisdom, Justice, & Moderation‚Äô. R.I.P.‚Äù The rest of us Demonstrators walked behind the casket around the perimeter of the Maddox inauguration, holding protest posters. We circled around the perimeter all during the inauguration.

For some Southern schools, even though SSOC had a presence, the numbers were so small in comparison to the size of the student bodies that it could not gain traction as anything but protest theatre. For example, SSOC organizers came to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, connected with a few individuals and left buttons and flyers with them and then departed. Of the 26,000 students on campus, only about ten were recruited. Early in 1969 these individuals gathered in a highly resonant hallway and staged an \\"organizational meeting\\". On audiotape it sounded like hundreds were attending and a motion was made to follow SDS's example at Columbia University and take over the campus Administration building the next day. The tape was \\"leaked\\" to the Administration of U.T. and, to the surprise of the participants, the next morning the campus was flooded with police, the windows of the Administration building were shuttered with wooden boards, and a truck was backed up to the doorway blocking entry while keeping the Administration locked inside. One of the members volunteered to brandish a toy water-pistol machine gun and parade back and forth in front of the building. Everyone else stayed out of sight. The individual was arrested and subsequently released. Nothing more happened.Personal recollection of Russ Reina Over time, radicals in SDS increasingly saw SSOC as too liberal and too timid. SSOC finally dissolved itself in 1969 as the result of an internal struggle with members of Progressive Labor, a Maoist sect, after members of PL had successfully passed a resolution at an SDS convention condemning SSOC's \\"anachronistic\\" regionalism and breaking the ties between the organizations.\\"The Kudzu: Birth and Death in Underground Mississippi\\" by David Doggett, in Voices from the Underground: Insider Histories of the Vietnam Era Underground Press ed. by Ken Wachsberger (Tempe, AZ: Mica's Press, 1993), p. 213-232. Doggett, who was at one point a candidate for president of SSOC, states that the conflict inside SSOC was a power struggle between a clique of SSOC headquarters staffers who were secretly Communist Party members, and insurgents from the Progressive Labor Party who had gotten control of some of the local branches. The breakup of SSOC came in 1969, the same year that its counterpart New Left Organizations, SNCC and SDS, collapsed‚Äîin part because of the COINTELPRO efforts, but in larger part because the movement had grown so widespread that the organizational forms of the early 1960s were no longer able to handle it. What SSOC organizer Ed Hamlett called \\"the radical beer-drinking five\\" on southern campuses became the long-haired pot-smoking hundreds (or thousands), and instead of getting ideas from mimeographed pamphlets, they could turn on the nightly news and see massive demonstrations and dramatic trials like those of the Chicago 7. In the bitterness following the breakup of SSOC, the organization's papers were taken and burned, lest they fall into the hands of the FBI. This also threatened the memory of the organization and its efforts with becoming historically extinct. However, in the 1990s, a graduate student at the University of Virginia, Gregg Michel, decided to write his dissertation on SSOC and began contacting and interviewing old activists, and organized a reunion of them in Charlottesville, VA in 1994. It turned out that many people had saved SSOC material, and were willing to donate them to an archive that was established at the University of Virginia Library. Michel's dissertation was published as Struggle for a Better South in 2004 and the memory of the organization was brought back from the brink of historic oblivion. The book was launched with a panel at the American Studies Association convention in Atlanta in 2004 that brought together many SSOC and SNCC activists (including all four SSOC chairmen). After the breakup of SSOC, two former members, Howard Romaine and Sue Thrasher, were instrumental in forming the Institute for Southern Studies with Julian Bond. Raymond Luc Levasseur, later the leader of the United Freedom Front, worked with the SSOC.\\"Raymond Luc Levasseur\\" Imprisoned Intellectuals. Retrieved Sept. 3, 2010.

There have been complaints that UMOPAR, which is effectively controlled by the United States military and Drug Enforcement Administration, was the most powerfully armed and best trained military force in Bolivia. In 1984, UMOPAR troops kidnapped the President of Bolivia, Siles Zuazo, and staged an unsuccessful coup attempt against the Bolivian government. U.S. involvement Although UMOPAR is technically headed by Defensa Social, a branch of the Bolivian Interior Ministry, they are in practice controlled by DEA and U.S. military officials based at the U.S. Embassy in La Paz, who plan their operations, provide intelligence, and lead the drug raids, using UMOPAR mainly as a \\"strike force\\" for U.S. operations. UMOPAR forces receive extensive training from DEA and U.S. military personnel, including the U.S. Army Special Forces, both in facilities in Bolivia (such as the Garras International Antinarcotics Training School), and at U.S. military bases such as Fort Benning, or the School of the Americas in Panama. In 1987, under a U.S. State Department contract, an Oregon corporation known as Evergreen International Airlines provided several private military contractor pilots, many of whom had flown for the CIA's Air America in Laos and Cambodia, to transport DEA agents and UMOPAR troops throughout the Upper Huallaga Valley. In 1988, U.S. Ambassador Rowell decided that UMOPAR troops needed their own air-mobile task force to increase their effectiveness. The United States Department of Defense loaned UMOPAR 12 UH-1H helicopters, and Rowell assigned his U.S. Army-Navy attache, Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Hayes to command the UMOPAR troops in the unit, which was called the Diablos Rojos (Red Devils). Human rights abuses UMOPAR troops have frequently been responsible for beatings, torture, rapes, extortion, robberies, arbitrary shootings, mass arrests without warrants, and various other human rights abuses. The use of torture by UMOPAR forces has been widespread and systematic, and includes methods such as being hung upside down and beaten, burned with cigarettes, electrocution, death threats, and being submerged underwater to simulate drowning, among other methods. UMOPAR forces act with almost total impunity, and human rights violations are rarely investigated, much less prosecuted. Other examples of abuses include: * In June 1988, UMOPAR troops killed 12 peasants and wounded over 100 in the Massacre of Villa Tunari * On May 9, 1997, two UMOPAR agents detained and beat a fifteen-year-old girl, Valeriana Condori, during a coca-eradication mission in Unc√≠a. * In July 1998, Father Hugo Ortiz, a Catholic priest and president of the Asamblea Permanente de Derechos Humanos de Bolivia (APDH), (Permanent Human Rights Assembly of Bolivia), was beaten by UMOPAR troops while travelling to a meeting. * In September 2000, a 19-year-old boy, Isaac Mej√≠a Arce was tortured to death by UMOPAR troops using a technique known as el arrastre (dragging), where two men sat on top of his body while it was dragged around over the ground (a method frequently used by UMOPAR troops to extract information from suspects). Arce began coughing up blood, and ultimately went into a coma, and died on February 1, 2001. * In 2002, a member of UMOPAR shot at two government representatives as they were entering a community to investigate human rights violations.

Description The .35 S&W; Automatic intended to compete with the Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless .32 ACP and Model 1908 .380 ACP pistols. The .35 caliber name implied a cartridge of diameter directly between those two popular calibers. In reality, actual bullet diameters were .312 for the .32 ACP and the .35 S&W;,Barnes, Frank. Cartridges of the World 13th Edition, page 337-338 and .355 for the .380 ACP. As such, the .35 S&W; Auto is actually an 8mm round instead of a 9mm round as the name implies. Smith & Wesson named it as such so as to not be confused with the similarly-sized .32 ACP. Despite possible reliability problems, .35 S&W; pistols can fire .32 ACP ammunition. The bullets are rather unusual with a full diameter un-jacketed lead-alloy surface enclosed within the case, and a sub-caliber jacket encasing the exposed nose with a rounded form for reliable loading. The .35 S&W; failed to catch on for a couple of reasons. One reason is that the advanced features of the Model 1913 failed to compensate for the earlier availability of the Colt pistols. Gun purchasers were also skeptical about a non-standard cartridge when .32 ACP ammunition was widely available, as at the time it was one of the most popular pistol cartridges in the world. The .35 S&W; Auto also did not perform as well ballistically as the .32 ACP that it was trying to compete with. Approximately 8,350 Model 1913 had been made when production stopped about 1921. Smith & Wesson shifted production to their Model 32 self-loading pistol chambered for the .32 ACP from 1924 to 1937. No other firearms were chambered for the .35 S&W;, and the cartridge is considered obsolete, and ammunition is rare and highly collectible.*Quertermous, Russell & Steve Modern Guns, p.398.

It is a story that unfolds in a span of two days and tackles issues like education, love, profession, marriage, family, life and relationships in a \\"fun and non-preachy way.\\"Pancharangi - Rediff Review As a film with minimal budget under Bhat's maiden home production, it fared well at the box-office.Pancharangi, 25 days and counting! The popular song Lifeu Ishtene was a runaway success and it was used as the title of Pawan Kumar's debut film.Pawan Kumar turning director with Lifu Ishtene Plot A family goes to a village near Mangalore to finalize a bride for the elder son, Lucky (Pavan Kumar). Lucky is a US-based software professional, and is a teetotaler, always abiding by the pressure and demands of his parents, so much to the fact that he does not have the courage to speak out that he already has a girlfriend. Bharath Kumar (Diganth), the youngest son, is a carefree individual with weird ideas on life. Bharath meets a tomboyish girl, Ambika (Nidhi Subbaiah), who is the house-owner's niece, and they begin to mingle well due to the nature of their personalities. However, following a few unusual twists and turns, the alliance is called off and the groom's family members walk out due to embarrassment. Ambika, who has now developed a strong feeling of love towards Bharath, goes ahead and confronts him. And finally, Bharath too says yes. Cast * Diganth as Bharath Kumar * Nidhi Subbaiah as Ambika * Ananth Nag as a wanderer (no name) * Ramya Barna as Latha, bride [voice by Neethu] * Padmaja Rao as Padma, groom's mother * Sundar Raj as Srinivas Rao, groom's father * Sudha Belawadi as Vaishali, bride's mother * Nagendra Shah as Narayan Rao, bride's father * Raju Talikote as a marriage broker, Panchakshari * Pawan Kumar as Lakshman \\"Lucky\\" Rao, groom * Sowmya Jaganmurthy as groom's girlfriend * Mithra as Keshavananda Swamiji, groom's uncle * Priyanka Upendra in a guest appearance * Sathish Ninasam as bus driver Production The film was shot mostly in the coastal areas of Karnataka, especially in the villages Ucchila, Kaapu in the Udupi district. St Mary's Island near Malpe was used for song picturisation, with some additional scenes in Bangalore. This was the fourth time Diganth has been cast as the main protagonist of the movie in a Yogaraj Bhat film. In addition to Diganth and Nidhi, the rest of the cast is the standard ensemble of Anant Nag, Padmaja Rao, Sudha Belavadi and Raju Talikote, accompanied by senior artists such as Nagendra Shah. Pawan Kumar, who has worked with Bhat on the story and screenplay of the movie, plays a supporting role himself. Cinematography The Pancharangi movie was shot with excellent photography by V. Thiyagarajan with creative ideas. Soundtrack The music for the film and soundtracks were scored by Mano Murthy, who has scored for many of the earlier films of Yogaraj Bhat. Lyrics for the soundtracks were penned by Jayant Kaikini and Yogaraj Bhat. The soundtrack album consists of twelve soundtracks. The audio of the film was released on 14 August 2010 by Sonu Nigam, Puneeth Rajkumar in the presence of cast and crew of the film. Critical reception Although the film was mentioned in the circles as a typical Yogaraj Bhat film, it went on to become a box-office success garnering significant returns in its first week itself. The \\"Lifeuu Ishtene\\" song from the film describing the stark realities of middle-class urban life was the highlight of the movie, and has already spawned several mock versions in Kannada.

Although in ancient times Seemantham was performed on the birth of each child, today it may be limited to the first born. This ritual is similar to a baby shower performed in Western cultures. The word \\"Seemantham/Seemantha\\" refers to parting the hair just above the eyebrow where the Goddess of Wealth, Sri Mahalakshmi, resides. This leads to the practice of applying kumkum to the parting in order to propitiate the Goddess Sri Lakshmi such that when a woman delivers a child, she is considered the embodiment of the Goddess Lakshmi herself. From the day of formation in its mother's womb, a child grows in different stages, each with a stipulated time frame. Accordingly, although brain formation takes place much earlier, memory cells are said to start activating upon the completion of seven months of pregnancy. Thereafter, the unborn child can record sounds and vibrations from its surroundings. Vedic tradition calls for the recitals of relics and verses known as Udhagasanthi or Uthakashanthi Japam in a soft but powerful mantra recital that lasts for about an hour and a half. On completion of this japam (recitals), the pregnant woman is bathed in cold holy water, without the addition of any warm or hot water. This takes place even late in the evening, whereupon the child in the womb shakes and jerks from the stimulation of the cold water. The specific function of japam is to give a solid state of mind in preparation for the child's birth through a positive vibration from the recited mantras that provide sufficient strength to the child in the womb, and create an atmosphere conducive to the earthly possessives on his or her birth. A bangle ceremony will also be held to decorate the mother with colorful bangles, mainly by the girl family members . Lastly the mother will be sent to her own family's house to stay for 2 months before delivery. Each Vedic mantra is designed for a specific stimulation, so that its phonetic vibration attains its fullest value. Udhakasanthi Japam gives confidence to the pregnant women and also increases her mental strength, with supportive gathering members blessing the child and mother for a normal delivery. Following the recital, the function continues with a veena recital of carnatic instrumentals and songs that create a calm and pleasant atmosphere. Meaning Nowadays Seemantham is often combined with a \\"Valaikaapu\\" ritual hosted by the pregnant woman's mother. The Seemantham ceremony is more religious in nature than the Valaikaapu, which is a more informal function. The ceremony itself has its roots in olden times when a woman would depend on the local midwife to deliver her child. In order to ease her passage, this ceremony would be performed to invoke blessings. These religious rituals may also be performed in a temple to avoid elaborate ceremonies. Relevance today (From \\"Growing Up Global: The Changing Transitions to Adulthood in Developing Countries\\") In Karnataka, Seemantha refers to the occasion conducted in pregnant women's parents' homes to seek blessings by the lord for safe delivery and happy life. The pregnant woman is presented with various gifts. This celebration in some ways is similar to the western practice of the baby shower. The ideal goals aside, in these times it has become increasingly a display of gold ornaments, lots of foods and an extravagant spending ritual. This was not the original intention of the function. In Tamil Nadu, the Seemantham ceremony marks a woman's passage into motherhood and celebrates her fertility. Seemantham is a ritual performed widely throughout Tamil Nadu by Hindus, Muslims, and Christians in preparation for a woman's first delivery, and its primary functions are to satisfy the pregnant woman's desires, bless her, and ensure a safe delivery and a healthy baby. Seemantham has become much more elaborate and expensive, according to the women, scholars, and religious figures interviewed by Van Hollen. Food has always been a central feature of the ceremony, but the amount of food has multiplied and sweets have taken on a more important role. Expectant first-time mothers are now more likely to receive cash, gold, and consumer items like household appliances, and in greater amounts. The husbands‚Äô families often request certain gifts, unlike in the past when guests brought gifts they had chosen. There is an increasing emphasis on displaying food and gifts at the Seemantham, which was not the case in the past. The reinvention of the Seemantham tradition is associated with the rising trend of conspicuous consumption that has occurred along with growing privatization and economic liberalization in Tamil Nadu and throughout southern Asia. According to Van Hollen (2003:78), Seemantham has come to represent a ‚Äúconvergence of the desires for new consumer technologies and for the display of wealth through ritual,‚Äù a trend that parallels the intensification of dowry practices throughout India. She discusses how these changes create a double burden for the families of first-time mothers: ‚ÄúThe growing economic burden of Seemantham (and other ritual gifts associated with the reproductive continuum) was compounded by the fact that the pregnant woman‚Äôs family in Tamil Nadu was also largely responsible for the medical expenses associated with childbirth. This was particularly true of the first delivery, since the pregnant woman almost always returned home for that delivery but not necessarily for consecutive deliveries‚Äù (p. 111). The Seemantham ceremony is usually conducted by the father's parents. In the AP state, Seemantham is a celebration performed for the pregnant lady on an auspicious day, mainly in either the fifth, seventh or ninth month. Long ago, Seemantham was performed twice: once by the pregnant lady's in-laws and the other time by her parents. These days, it's all combined into a single elaborate celebration performed by the parents and the gifts are brought over by the in-laws (during her first pregnancy only). The gifts include a saree with two blouse pieces, baskets full of between five and nine kinds of sweet and savory food items and fruits for the pregnant woman, towels or clothes for the man, and clothes for the in-laws. The savory items include sakinalu and madugulu; sweet items include arasalu, garjalu and laddulu. Fruits include apples, oranges, pomegranates, mosambi, and others, but no bananas. The elaborate lunch or dinner is served by the in-laws. The pregnant woman and the man sit in chairs facing east. She is anointed with kumkum (vermillion) and gandham (sandal), paspu (turmeric) is offered for mangalyam, and paspu is applied to her feet by her mother. Then she is given a saree and blouse and a string of mallepuvu (jasmine flowers), all placed in her saree kongu/wollu. The man is anointed with kumkum and given clothes by the woman's father. Then the in-laws are seated adjacently and also marked with kumkum and given clothes by the lady's parents. The woman takes all these gifts, adorns herself, and goes to the deity and offers a prayer. Meanwhile, all women present are offered kumkum and paspu. The woman and the man come back and sit in the chairs. The woman's mother applies kumkum, gandham, and offers paspu for mangalyam. Then she places two green glass bangles on each hand. The mother places four kinds of fruits, and five savory and sweet foods (for a total of nine items) in her wollu/kongu. Then she blesses her with akshanthalu for safe delivery. The mother then places five varieties of sweet and savory food items in the man's wollu. A little girl, adabidda, sits beside the woman in the chair. Four older women perform the same ritual - they offer just one fruit and four savory and sweet items, totaling five items, to the woman. The woman is then given mangala aarthi by these five older women and traditional songs are sung. She is assisted in getting up carefully with all the gifts in her wollu intact and taken to the deity's place where she offers a prayer and places the gifts (leaving five foods in the wollu) in a tray (these are consumed by the woman, man and children). Then the woman is fed with sweets and pulihora rice. She returns with her wollu and takes blessings from her in-laws, husband, sister-in-law, and parents by touching their feet. Then she places the rest of the food items in her wollu with the rest of the gifts near the Deity. The in-laws will offer the female guests kumkum, paspu, flowers and thamboolam, gift bags which consist of betel leaves, betel nut, sweets and a coin (optional).

Paik was one of the first pupils to receive the black belt under Yoon Byung-In, and Kim Ki Whang with whom he continued his training after Yoon's disappearance during the Korean War. Paik's system of Sa-Sang built upon the Ch'uan Fa (Korean: Kwon Bup) he had mastered under Yoon Byung- In, and included elements of Shudokan karate from both Yoon and Kim. Paik completed the system with his research into training effective kicking techniques.Taekwondo Hall of Fame: History of Paik's USA Taekwondo Retrieved on 7 February 2010. He created four primary forms (Korean: hyung), symbolizing each of the four natural elements. He also developed a rigorous philosophy unique to the system, and intended to be carried into one's everyday life.From the notes of Paik former chief instructor Gerald F. Neviaser (1984‚Äì1997). Biography Upon completing his PhD in animal pathology at National University of Seoul, South Korea, Paik moved to the United States in 1969 to work as a research pathologist at the University of Wisconsin's Primate Research Center in Madison, Wisconsin. In 1971, he opened \\"Paik's U.S. Oriental Martial Arts Institute\\", and soon left his research position to devote all of his efforts to teaching the martial arts. In 1977, Paik purchased a former elementary school(Sunnyside Elementary) building in Madison and converted it to a unique training facility consisting of three gymnasiums and numerous live-in dormitories for serious students and staff. His intent was to create a unique \\"institution for higher learning in the martial arts\\". He renamed his school \\"Paik's Academy of Martial Arts\\", and for the next 20 years taught thousands of students and conducted numerous \\"special weekend\\" sessions to train his black belt staff. These intensive sessions required early morning meditation, 8 hours of hard training per day, all meals together, and overnight camping in the gymnasium. Paik noted these sessions mirrored those he attended regularly under Grandmasters Yoon and Kim in Korea. Paik also maintained a relationship with the World Taekwondo Federation since its inception in 1973,. He was selected to host the 1990 USA Taekwondo National Championships - the initial U.S. qualifying event for the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona. This was the second Olympic games to include Taekwondo as a demonstrator sport. The tournament was held in Madison, Wisconsin at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum of the Alliant Energy Center. In 1989, Paik had served as Team director of the U.S. delegate Team for the World games events leading up to the 1992 Olympics. Despite his long traditional background, Paik was passionate about creativity and continued advancement in the martial arts. By the mid-1970s, he had developed and rigorously taught full independence of leg motion in kicking techniques (i.e. kicks to multiple targets before bringing the foot back to the ground). This was not done in traditional Taekwondo or Karate at the time. He also implemented a first ever Taekwondo Creative Forms Division at the 1990 USA Taekwondo National Championships to allow competitors to develop and perform their own personalized forms (Korean: Hyung). In a communication to lobby for this idea, Paik wrote: \\"With creativity, techniques become art; art becomes philosophy. While we must always respect and practice traditional form, we must also allow for the creative process to continue to advance the martial arts.\\"From the notes of Paik former chief instructor Gerald F. Neviaser, who assisted Paik with development of Creative Form Division at 1990 USTU Nationals. Paik retired from full-time teaching in 1997 at 68 years of age, and passed the school to his son Peter Paik, 8th dan, who continues to operate the school in Madison, Wisconsin under the name of \\"Paik's Traditional Martial Arts Center - School of Integrity.\\" Sang Kee Paik died peacefully surrounded by his family on July 12, 2009, after a long battle with cancer.Dr. Sang Kee Paik Family Blog Obituary Announcement Retrieved on 16 March 2010. His memorial service was held in Madison, Wisconsin on Saturday, July 25, 2009 and was attended by hundreds of his former students. Son Peter and daughter Myung (Mia) felt the best way to eulogize their father was to allow Paik's former students to speak at the podium. Many did, and universally recounted what an extraordinary teacher Paik was, and the positive and permanent impact he had upon their lives. Also noted was Paik's penchant for taking in at-risk or troubled students, sometimes by offering free lessons, and then successfully bringing about life-changing reform through a mixture of benevolence and tough discipline.

The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 31571. (Click on \\"Technische gegevens\\" to view.) History De Gans was built in 1850 by farmer Martinus Aukes Wierda who owned the Guozzep√¥le farm. The mill drained the Ganzenpolder. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) It drained of land, depositing the drainage water into the Zuider Ee. By 1962, it was uneconomic to work the mill and it was replaced by an electric motor. It had been sold to the local authority by 1965. In 1970, the mill was restored by millwright De Roos of Leeuwarden. During this restoration the Patent sails were replaced with Common sails. The mill retained its wooden windshaft after this restoration. In 1988, the mill was again restored, this time by Thijs Jellema of Birdaard. A new cast-iron windshaft was fitted. The old wooden windshaft is preserved in De Zwaluw, Birdaard. De Gans is the sole survivor of six windmills which formerly drained the Ganzenpolder. Description De Gans is what the Dutch describe as an achtkante grondzeiler - a smock mill whose sails reach almost to the ground. It is a two-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The smock is covered in vertical wooden boards. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of . The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 32 cogs. This drives the wallower (18 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel, which has 28 cogs drives a gearwheel with 26 cogs on the axle of the Archimedes' screw. The axle of the screw is 210 millimetres (2¬º inches) diameter and the screw is diameter and long. The screw is inclined at 24¬∞. Each revolution of the screw lifts of water.

SCSI and iSCSI Protocol The Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a family of protocols for communicating with I/O devices, especially storage devices. SCSI is based on client-server model. SCSI clients, called \\"initiators\\", issue SCSI commands to request services from components, logical units of a server known as a \\"target\\". A \\"SCSI transport\\" maps the client-server SCSI protocol to a specific interconnect. An Initiator is one endpoint of a SCSI transport and a target is the other endpoint. Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) protocol uses TCP/IP as SCSI transport. By transporting SCSI packets over TCP/IP, iSCSI provides an interoperable solution which can take advantage of existing Internet infrastructure, Internet management facilities, and address distance limitations. Unlike traditional Fibre Channel, which requires special-purpose cabling, iSCSI can run on the existing network infrastructure. It has become a popular storage area network (SAN) protocol because of its scalability and economic benefits. The protocol is defined in RFC 3720 and updated in RFC 5048. iSCSI Conformance Testing With the moving of SCSI transport layer from the traditional reliable bus structure to the far more unreliable TCP/IP network, a fairly reasonable amount of complexity has been introduced into iSCSI: * Login/Logout processes are needed. * Security/Operational parameters need to be negotiated during login. * CHAP or other authentication method may be used during login. * Multiple sessions/connections may be required. * Multiple error recovery level may be implemented. * ... In one word, although the economic cost of iSCSI may be lower than others, the protocol itself is not that simple. Since the approval of the protocol, iSCSI has been steadily gaining acceptance among end users and storage vendors. Nowadays, there exist a large number of iSCSI initiator/target implementations on the market, either commercial or free/open source. These implementations vary in functionalities and protocol conformance. Conformance testing is testing to determine whether a system meets some specified standard. It's often performed by external organizations, sometimes the standards body itself, to give greater guarantees of compliance. Products tested in such a manner are then advertised as being certified by that external organization as complying with the standard. For iSCSI protocol (or other data networking and storage protocols), The University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL) is one of the premier neutral, third-party laboratory who offers test suites for iSCSI conformance testing. As the introduction part in these test suites says: > These tests are designed to determine if an iSCSI product conforms to > specifications defined in both IETF RFC 3720 iSCSI (hereafter referred to as > the ‚ÄúiSCSI Standard‚Äù) as well as updates as contained in IETF RFC 5048 iSCSI > Corrections and Clarifications RFC (hereafter referred to as ‚ÄúiSCSI > Corrections and Clarifications‚Äù). Successful completion of all tests > contained in this suite does not guarantee that the tested device will > successfully operate with other iSCSI products. However, when combined with > satisfactory operation in the IOL‚Äôs interoperability test bed, these tests > provide a reasonable level of confidence that the Device Under Test (DUT) > will function properly in many iSCSI environments. iSCSI conformance testing mainly contains the following aspects: * Login Phase Conformance : Test negotiation key-value pairs; test various flags: CSG, NSG, C bit, T bit... * Full Feature Phase Conformance : Test sequence numbers (CmdSN, DataSN, R2TSN); test SCSI Command/Response, Task Management Function Request/Response, Text Request/Response, NOP-In/NOP-Out, SNACK Request... * CHAP Conformance : Test CHAP fields: CHAP_A, CHAP_C, CHAP_I, CHAP_N, CHAP_R... * Multi Connection Conformance : Test multi-connection support in connection creation, termination, parameter negotiation, sequence number and task management... * Error Recovery Conformance : Test Initiator/Target's error recovery support iSCSI Conformance Testing Common Scenarios Basically two types of actions could be taken to test whether the DUT meets the iSCSI protocol: * We do correct things and see if the DUT behaves correctly. In this case, the main task is to send a correct sequence of iSCSI PDUs to the DUT, and to verify the DUT can respond with correct PDUs/PDU fields. * We do wrong things and see if the DUT can detect and behave accordingly. In this case, we must modify the PDU sequence sent to the DUT to some extent (e.g., change CmdSN of a command, set an invalid data digest...), and verify the DUT can react according to the protocol (e.g., send a Reject PDU, close the connection...). Some common scenarios can be found in iSCSI conformance testing: * iSCSI functional test : To test whether an iSCSI task can be executed correctly (Task Management Function, NOP-In/NOP-Out Ping, multiple connections management...) * PDU format error : For example, this is an error if the W and F bit are both set to 0 in a SCSI Command PDU. * PDU session/stage error : For example, this is an error if a SCSI Command PDU appears in login stage or discovery session. * Header/Data digest error : Digest error can cause the Target/Initiator to send Reject/SNACK PDU. * Sequence error : CmdSN/StatSN/DataSN/R2T each has different scope and different rules. *Negotiation error : Text parameters should be in key=value format, followed by one NULL (\\"0x00\\") delimiter. Each text parameter also has its own stage and negotiation rules. For example, FirstBurstLength must not exceed MaxBurstLength, SendTargets should appear only in Full Feature Phase, etc. *Data length error : Too much or too little data is sent to the Target. *Lost PDU : Drop an incoming PDU then SNACK for it, drop an outgoing PDU then retry it. Most of the above scenarios can be emulated by modifying the content of the output PDU. For example, to emulate a data digest error, we just need to change the DataDigest field in the PDU. iSCSI Conformance Testing Tool Requirement An iSCSI conformance testing tool can be viewed as an iSCSI Initiator emulator (to test iSCSI Target) or an iSCSI Target emulator (to test iSCSI Initiator). A good iSCSI conformance testing tool should meet the following requirements: * Executable test scripts : An executable script is needed for each test case. It should be written according to test case description which defines the PDU sequence and verification points. * An iSCSI Engine core : The iSCSI Engine core is in charge of sending/receiving iSCSI PDUs to/from DUT (Device Under Test). On one side, it accepts input from test script, sending PDUs or verifying check points; on the other, it should understand iSCSI protocol to a certain level so that necessary automation can be achieved, e.g., the automatic generation of iSCSI PDUs (Login/Text Request during negotiation, Nop-Out ping response, ) and some PDU fields (ITT, TTT, CmdSN, data, digest...). * PDU format validation : For received PDUs, iSCSI Engine core should do validation check to detect malformed PDU. * Ability to modify PDU's content : Malformed PDUs are often sent to DUT to simulate PDU format error or digest error. * Ability to drop PDU : PDU could be dropped to simulate lost PDU during transmission. * Ability to maintain multiple sessions/connections : Just like Error Recovery, multiple sessions/connections support is an advanced field in iSCSI protocol. * Result and log : Pass or Fail of a test case should have obvious indication. Detailed log is needed for analysis. It would be better to have a graphical interface to analyze PDU dump files. * A Batch system : A batch system is needed to manage test suites and test cases so that large number of test scripts can run automatically without user intervention. Available iSCSI Conformance Testing Tools * UNH-IOL test service The iSCSI consortium provide a service to test iSCSI products and software from both interoperability and conformance perspectives. Membership is needed for cutting edge testing equipment and IOL testing tools. * iSCSISim Open-source software. iSCSISim is also an iSCSI initiator emulator to test iSCSI targets. Written in Python, its capabilities include SCSI command injection, error insertion, and recovery testing. * libiscsi Open-source software. libiscsi is a userspace library that implements an iSCSI initiator. Written in C it comes with an iSCSI/SCSI test-suite called iscsi- test-cu that can test a target's conformance. * Calsoft‚Äôs iSCSI Protocol Conformance Test Suite Commercial software.

It involves all of the operations from production through drug distribution channels to the end consumer. Pharmaceutical packaging is highly regulated but with some variation in the details, depending on the country of origin or the region. Several common factors can include: assurance of patient safety, assurance of the efficacy of the drug through the intended shelf life, uniformity of the drug through different production lots, thorough documentation of all materials and processes, control of possible migration of packaging components into the drug, control of degradation of the drug by oxygen, moisture, heat, etc., prevention of microbial contamination, sterility, etc. Packaging is often involved in dispensing, dosing, and use of the pharmaceutical product. Communication of proper use and cautionary labels are also regulated. Packaging is an integral part of pharmaceutical product. Segments of usage Pharmaceutical packaging can often be thought of by the segment in the distribution system being encountered and by the functions needed by the user of the package. Packaging requirements are different. Bulk drugs in fiber drums Bulk pharmaceuticals can be shipped to another pharmaceutical company for further processing, to a contract packager for forming unit packs, to international customers, etc. Bulk shipments might be in fiber drums (with plastic liners), bulk boxes, corrugated boxes with liners, intermediate bulk containers, and other shipping containers. Smaller bulk packs can be shipped to pharmacies, particularly compounding pharmacies. The liquids or powders can be measured and put into primary packages. Shipments to medical professionals could be at hospitals, nursing homes, veterinarians, dentists, etc. These packaged pharmaceuticals are intended to be dispensed and administered by professionally trained and certified personnel. Preparing consumer packaging of prescription drugs at pharmacy Drugs under prescription control are sent to pharmacies in multi-packs of unit packs or in bottles containing many hundreds of capsules. Typically a pharmacist prepares the final form of the unit pack or places a lower count of capsules in a small bottle for the customer. In a pharmacy, pharmacists are available to answer questions and to ensure that proper documentation is provided. Internet pharmacies mail the prescribed drugs to the customer; boxes or mailing envelopes are used. Child resistant packaging is often required on the unit packs; if requested, a pharmacist is allowed put drugs in a bottle with easy open features. Over-the-counter drugs are sold in drug stores, grocery stores, and diverse retail outlets. Usually the package needs to have all the usage information available. Packages often need to have tamper resistant features and child-resistant packaging. Usually the packaging and labeling of dietary supplements, homeopathic drugs, and folk medicines are not regulated. Some producers voluntarily follow the regulations for over-the- counter drugs or regional Pharmacopoeias. Package forms The wide variety of pharmaceutical solids, liquids, and gasses are packaged in a wide variety of packages. Some of the common primary packages are: Blister packs Birth control pills in blister packs Formed solid unit doses of pharmaceuticals (capsules, suppositories, tablets, etc.) are commonly packed in blister packs. In Europe about 85% of solid unit doses are packed in blister packs with only about 20% in North America. Blister packs are pre- formed plastic/paper/foil packaging used for formed solid drugs. The primary component of a blister pack is a cavity or pocket made from a thermoformed plastic. This usually has a backing of paperboard or a lidding seal of aluminum foil or plastic film. Blister packs are useful for protecting drugs against external factors, such as humidity and contamination for extended periods of time. Blister packing machinery is readily available and is suited to validation processes. Bottles A foil innerseal on a bottle Bottles are commonly used for liquid pharmaceuticals as well as formed tablets and capsules. Glass is most common for liquids because it is inert and has excellent barrier properties. Various types of plastic bottles are used both by drug producers as well as by pharmacists in a pharmacy. Prescription bottles have been around since the 19th century. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, prescription medication bottles were called medicinal bottles. There are many styles and shapes of prescription bottles. Bottles would often include cotton to cushion powdery, breakable pills. In modern times, pills are coated, and thus the inclusion of a cotton ball is no longer necessary. The U.S. National Institute of Health recommends consumers remove any cotton balls from opened pill bottles, as cotton balls may attract moisture into the bottle. Prescription bottles come in several different colors, the most common of which being orange or light brown due to its ability to prevent ultraviolet light from degrading the potentially photosensitive contents through photochemical reactions, while still letting enough visible light through for the contents to be easily visible. Other common colors include: Clear (for compounds that don't degrade in light), blue, dark brown, green, and various opaque hues. Temperature Shipment of vaccine: PU insulated box, gel packs, temp monitor, etc. Many pharmaceutical products are sensitive to heat or cold. Controlled distribution systems and sometimes cold chains are required. A mail order or online pharmacy usually ships orders by mail services or by small parcel carrier. The shipment is not temperature-controlled and it may sit in a mail box upon delivery. Conditions can include high or low temperatures outside of the recommended storage conditions for certain products. For example, the USFDA found that the temperature in a steel mailbox painted black could reach 136 ¬∞F (58 ¬∞C) in full sun while the ambient air temperature was 101 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C). Insulated mailing envelopes are sometimes used. Larger shipments are sent in insulated shipping containers with dry ice or gel packs. A digital temperature data logger or a time temperature indicator is often enclosed to monitor the temperature inside the container for its entire shipment. Counterfeiting Counterfeit drugs are a serious problem; people can be taking useless drugs or even very dangerous drugs without knowing it. Custom package seals, authentication labels, holograms, and security printing, can be valued parts of an entire security system. They help verify that enclosed drugs are what the package says they are. Drug counterfeiters, however, often work with package counterfeiters, some of whom can be sophisticated. No packaging system is completely secure. Prescription labels Medication packaging includes a document that provides information about that drug and its use. For prescription medications, the insert is technical, and provides information for medical professionals about how to prescribe the drug. Package inserts for prescription drugs often include a separate document called a \\"patient package insert\\" with information written in plain language intended for the end-user -- the person who will take the drug or give the drug to another person, for example a minor. Inserts for over-the-counter medications are also written plainly. In the US the document is called \\"prescribing information\\" or the \\"package insert\\" (PI) and layperson's document is called the \\"patient package insert\\" (PPI). In Europe the technical document is called the \\"summary of product characteristics\\" and the document for end-users is called the \\"package leaflet\\". The bottle or box also has information printed on it, intended for the person taking the medication. Packaging production Example pharmaceutical packaging line All aspects of pharmaceutical production, including packaging, are tightly controlled and have regulatory requirements. Uniformity, cleanliness (washdown), sterility, and other requirements are needed to maintain Good Manufacturing Practices. Product safety management is vital. A complete Quality Management System must be in place. Validation involves collecting documentary evidence of all aspects of compliance. Hazard analysis and critical control points is a methodology which has been proven useful. Quality assurance extends beyond the packaging operations through distribution and cold chain management; Good distribution practice is often a regulatory requirement. Track and trace systems are usually required. With a large portion of pharmaceutical packaging being outsourced to contract packagers, additional demand is being placed on specialty areas, i.e. specialty dosage forms.

TNSDL is based on the ITU-T SDL-88 language. It is used exclusively at Nokia Networks, primarily for developing applications for telephone exchanges. Purpose TNSDL is a general-purpose procedural programming language. It is especially well-suited for developing highly concurrent, distributed systems. It was originally designed for programming circuit switched exchanges. As the world shifted towards packet-switched and internet-based telecommunication, TNSDL turned out to be an excellent fit for developing internet servers, too. Design TNSDL is a very simple, easy-to-learn programming language. Basics TNSDL is a strongly typed procedural programming language. Its basic capabilities are comparable to the C and Pascal languages. Multi- processing In TNSDL processes are created by the CREATE command. (It is somewhat similar to the POSIX fork or pthread_create commands.) The CREATE command creates either an operating system process or a cooperative task. The process model can be selected by configuration. The source code itself does not reflect which scheduling method is used. Still, to avoid certain race conditions, developers may need to be prepared for parallel execution. TNSDL explicitly supports critical sections to be marked in the code. In case of cooperative multitasking a program is scheduled as one operating system process. When a cooperative thread enters the state of waiting for asynchronous input, another thread of the program may run. Message passing The feature of TNSDL is the actor model. Processes are meant to be designed as event-driven finite state machines. Inter-process communication is done by asynchronous message passing. The OUTPUT command sends a message, while INPUT statements define the expected messages. Timers, from TNSDL perspective, are delayed messages. Just like ordinary messages, timer expiration is handled by the INPUT statement. The SET command starts and the RESET command cancels a timer. State machines can be optionally used, for example, to prevent accepting certain input messages at some stage of the processing. The following code piece demonstrates a server, which receives a query signal (message), contacts a database process to obtain the necessary data and finally sends an answer signal. DCL WITHWARMING /* Data to be live- migrated (on platforms supporting \\"warming\\") */ query_process pid; /* PID of query_signal sender */ CONSTANT time_to_wait = 10; /* Timeout of database response */ TIMER db_timeout_timer; /* Timer of database response */ STATE idle; /* Idle state, wait for query signal */ INPUT query_signal(DCL input_data); DCL db_query db_query_type; /* Local variable, stored on stack. */ TASK query_process := SENDER; /* Sender address saved to specific memory area, which is preserved even on software update.*/ TASK db_query.field1 := some_procedure(input_data), db_query.field2 := input_data.field1; OUTPUT db_request_signal(db_query) TO db_process; /* Send request to database process */ SET(NOW + time_to_wait, db_timeout_timer); /* Start database response timer */ NEXTSTATE wait_db; /* Enter wait_db state where database response is expected */ ENDSTATE idle; STATE wait_db; INPUT db_response_signal(DCL answer_data); RESET(db_timeout_timer) COMMENT 'Database answered in time'; OUTPUT answer_signal(answer_data.records) TO query_process; NEXTSTATE idle; INPUT db_timeout_timer; /* Timeout */ OUTPUT error_signal(error_constant) TO query_process; NEXTSTATE idle; ENDSTATE wait_db; Comments: * The state machine prevents any new query_signal to be processed while waiting for the database program to answer. * WITHWARMING means that when another computer takes over the role of the current one, the marked data (variable) will be copied to the new computer. Therefore, if hardware change or software update happens while waiting for the database to answer, the address of the query sender will not be lost, and the answer can be delivered properly. It is not supported on all platforms, though. TNSDL allows inputs to be tied to several or all of the states. An input signal may have state-specific behavior, if needed. STATE idle COMMENT 'Idle state'; INPUT are_you_busy; OUTPUT no TO SENDER; NEXTSTATE -; /* No state change */ /* ... other input handlers */ ENDSTATE idle; STATE *(idle) COMMENT 'Any state, except idle'; INPUT are_you_busy; OUTPUT yes TO SENDER; NEXTSTATE -; /* No state change */ ENDSTATE *(idle); STATE * COMMENT 'Any state'; INPUT are_you_alive; OUTPUT yes TO SENDER; NEXTSTATE -; /* No state change */ ENDSTATE *; Differences from SDL-88 Nokia has made several modifications to the language, mainly including simplifications and additions, such as: * Features like channels and signal routes have been replaced by other mechanisms. * The concepts of modules and services were added in TNSDL (the service concept of SDL-88 is similar to the subautomaton feature of TNSDL). * Some elements have been renamed (for example Priority Inputs are called Input Internals in TNSDL). * In TNSDL the MACRO feature has been omitted and a WHILE construct has been added to allow loops in a structured way without using JOINs. Compiling TNSDL is not directly compiled to machine code. Instead, TNSDL programs are translated to C language source code. The responsibility of TNSDL is to allow message handling, state machine definitions, synchronizing parallel execution, \\"data warming\\" etc. easily and safely coded. The task of processor-specific code generation and low-level optimization is delegated to the C compiler used. After translating TNSDL to C, any standard-compliant C compiler, linker, coverage measurement and profiling tool can be used. To make source-level debugging possible TNSDL puts line number references to the generated C code. TNSDL code can call routines implemented in other languages, if objects or libraries are present for them. Even C language macros can be used, if C header files are present. External declarations must be made available to the TNSDL translator. The TNSDL translator is a proprietary tool. A source code (reachability) analyser has also been developed specifically for TNSDL. Use TNSDL is commonly used on the DX 200, IPA 2800 and Linux platforms for high-performance, high-availability applications. TNSDL is an actively used and developed programming language used by thousands of developers (in 2010). TNSDL is mainly used at Nokia Networks for developing software for SGSNs, BSCs, mobile switching centers, application servers both in traditional setups and as virtual network functions (VNF) of NFV solutions.  Similar programming languages  Despite the difference in syntax, probably one of the closest relative of TNSDL is Go language. Both languages has light-weight processes in their focus. Go's channel are similar to TNSDL INPUTs and Go's select statement on channels allows very similar program design. There are differences, though. TNSDL uses asynchronous message passing between actors, while channels in Go can either be synchronous or asynchronous (buffered). TNSDL allows message passing between processes running on the same or separate computer nodes. In that aspect TNSDL is a relative of Erlang. Even though in TNSDL one can define operators for types and protect structure attributes to be accessible via those operators only, TNSDL is not an object-oriented language. In that aspect it belongs to the family of non-OOP procedural programming languages, such as C language. History 1980s: In the beginning, ITU-T SDL had a graphical syntax. Textual syntax was introduced later. A corresponding graphical tool and code generator were developed within Nokia. 1990: ITU-T SDL shifted towards text-based representation. Based on the SDL-88 specification TNSDL was born. TNSDL is a simplified and heavily customized variant of SDL-88.

History   Origins and Growth, in Italy and in the World  The story of the Marcegaglia Group began in 1959 in Italy, when Steno Marcegaglia, not quite thirty, together with a partner, through Marcegaglia-Caraffini of Gazoldo degli Ippoliti (Mantua), took over an artisan company producing irrigation pipes and metal guides for rolling shutters. Four years later, in Contino di Volta Mantovana, a company named IPAS was established to manufacture round and flat drawn products with some ten employees. Meanwhile, in the Gazoldo degli Ippoliti factory, where around 30 employees were already working on the production of open profiles, the first tubes from cold-rolled strip were beginning to be manufactured. From 1963 onwards the production activities of these small companies were enhanced and extended with timely, constant investments. And in 1969 a new rolling mill was purchased for the manufacture of cold-rolled strip. In 1974 the Gazoldo degli Ippoliti establishment had over 250,000 square metres of industrial sheds. The production range was diversified and complemented with the addition of tubes from hot-rolled strip. In 1978, after acquiring Laminatoi Meridionali in Arzano (Naples), the Marcegaglia Group drove its industrial activities further forward through a programme of acquisition of depressed companies, which were then reorganised and made competitive in the various sectors in which they were operating. In 1982, when the overall number of employees had already reached 640, the second largest establishment in the group was founded in Casalmaggiore, equipped with technologically advanced installations made by \\"Oto Mills\\" of Boretto (Reggio Emilia). This company, acquired in partnership with other partners in 1979, would have a key role in the technical innovation of all the production plants of the Group. In 1983, three new companies were acquired: Lombarda Tubi of Lomagna (Lecco), Saom of Boltiere (Bergamo) and Trisider of Tezze (Vicenza). By 1983 the overall ‚Äúmade in Marcegaglia‚Äù turnover had risen to the equivalent of 175 million euros and the workforce exceeded 860 employees. The group of companies continued to be personally overseen by Steno Marcegaglia, together with his wife Palmira Bazzani, joined subsequently by their son and daughter Antonio and Emma. In 1984, an internal restructuring plan redefined the character of the group. Former Metallurgica Marcegaglia, former Ipas and former Tubi Acciaio were merged in the newly established Marcegaglia Spa. Lombarda Tubi incorporated the former Saom, whilst Trisider and Oto Mills maintained their corporate autonomy in the distribution and engineering sector. In 1985, the Marcegaglia Group continued to develop its industrial activities with the acquisition of three major companies in the Maraldi group: Maraldi of Ravenna, Forlisider of Forlimpopoli (Forl√¨) and Salpa of Cervignano del Friuli (Udine), specialising in the production of water, gas and methane pipes, which would then be restructured and transformed into the new Marcegaglia plants in Forl√¨, Cervignano and Ravenna. In 1985, after the acquisition of Cct of Santo Stefano Ticino (Milan), Profilnastro of Dusino San Michele (Asti) ‚Äì at the time under temporary receivership ‚Äì producer of tubes from hot-rolled strip, was also acquired. The management of the companies in operation as a result of the restructuring, the monitoring of the involvement of the group in non-metal industrial companies and the management of a significant share and bond portfolio, made it necessary in 1987 to form a new company, Fingem Spa, which has become one of the largest financial operators in the national and European markets. In 1987 Antonio Marcegaglia joined the company after graduating in business studies from Milan's Luigi Bocconi University. In 1988, the Island of Albarella was purchased from Credit Suisse. This tourism complex has now become one of the most renowned holiday, health and relaxation resorts on the Adriatic Sea. Led by Antonio Marcegaglia, the diversification of the group was then extended with the establishment of Bioindustrie Mantovane and the acquisition of Oskar of Osteria Grande (Bologna), Nuova Omec, Ennepi of Lugo di Romagna (Ravenna) and Imat of Fontanafredda (Pordenone) in 1988 and of CCT of Gallarate (Varese) and Elet. Ca of Capalle (Florence) in 1989, as well as the foundation in 1989 of Marcegaglia Impianti of Saronno (Varese). In the same year, Marcegaglia acquired holdings in Fergallo of Motteggiana (Mantua), SIM of Sant'Atto (Teramo) and Elletre of Montebello Vicentino (Vicenza). In 1991 the Group acquired Resco Tubi of Cusago (Milan) and OMF of Fiume Veneto (Pordenone). In 1994 it acquired Brollo Profilati of Desio (Milan), later moved to the ‚Äúformer Breda‚Äù area just outside Milan, on site totalling 80 thousand square metres purchased in 1996, and then in 1995 ETA Euro Tubi Acciaio of Milan, followed by a stake in Allu's of Sesto al Reghena (Pordenone). The new business and production constellation enabled the group to have a presence also in the sectors of metal household items, electrostatic paint for metals and metal components for the electrical appliance industry. Meanwhile, its metallurgical sector grew with the production of fine stainless steel tubes and cold-rolled profiles. In 1996, the Euro Energy Group was also established in order to create plants for the production of energy from renewable sources. In January 1997 Nuova Forsidera Spa,Corriere della sera. Marcegaglia rileva Forsidera specialising in steel cold rolling and galvanising processes, was acquired with its plants in Corsico (Milan) and Albignasego (Padua). The group's energy division was expanded in 1997 under the guidance of Antonio Marcegaglia with the establishment of Green Power, for the development of strategies and systems for energy generation through the gasification of waste and biomass. Further expansion came in 1998, with the design and construction of industrial and power boilers. In that same year came the acquisition of Astra of Mezzolara, Budrio (Bologna) and the Siderplating establishment was also acquired, under the name of Marcegaglia San Giorgio of Nogaro (Udine), producing rolling mill plates. Antonio Marcegaglia's corporate development programme continued in 1999 with the acquisition of Morteo Nord of Pozzolo Formigaro (Alessandria),La Stampa Marcegaglia: rilancio della Morteo in 3 anni and Ponteggi Dalmine of Milan, Graffignana (Lodi) and Potenza. This was followed in 2001 by the acquisition, in the tourism sector, of the holiday resort of Pugnochiuso, situated on the Gargano promontory in Puglia. In December 2001, following an investment of over 500 million euros over very few years, the large new establishment in Ravenna was opened: the second largest iron and steel centre in Italy. And in 2002, in the former Belleli area in Taranto, its second largest production plant in the South, after the one in Potenza, entered into operation In 2003, the sector of products for the household electrical appliance industry expanded further with the acquisition of BVB of San Lorenzo in Campo (Pesaro). While in 2004 the group took a fundamental step in the development of its activities in the tourism sector by acquiring, with Banca Intesa and the Ifil group, 49% of Sviluppo Italia Turismo In 2007 Antonio Marcegaglia acquired the stake in Gabetti Property Solutions and upgraded the Ravenna plant with a further investment of 300 million euros. The Group continued its expansion in the energy sector where, with its subsidiary Arendi, began production of photovoltaic panels. Likewise, its presence in tourism grew further with the acquisition of the management of Forte Village of Santa Margherita di Pula, in Sardinia, the largest hotel complex in Italy and Europe. This was followed soon after by the ‚ÄúLe Tonnare‚Äù holiday resort in Stintino, in the province of Sassari. In 2007 the production plant at Boltiere (Bergamo) was also enlarged. In 2008 the Group acquired the holiday location at Castel Monastero di Castelnuovo Berardenga (Siena) and the \\"Former Arsenale\\" property complex at La Maddalena (Sassari).  Internationalisation of the Group  In 1989, Antonio Marcegaglia launched the Marcegaglia Group's internationalisation policyGazzetta di Mantova Operazione sui mercati esteri affidata da Steno al figlio Antonio Marcegaglia which has strengthened its direct presence in the international markets. Marcegaglia Deutschland of D√ºsseldorf was established in 1989 for the distribution of the Group's own products on the German market and in Scandinavia. United Stainless Steel was also created in the UK near London, followed by Marcegaglia U.K., for the production of welded tubes from hot and cold rolled strip, and then by Marcegaglia UK at Dudley, West Midlands. In 1991 Antonio Marcegaglia launched the project which would see the group enter into the transatlantic markets. In the second half of the year The New Bishop Tube of Philadelphia was acquired in the US, and, in February 1992, Damascus of Greenville. Two major production units which then led to the creation of Damascus-Bishop Tube Company, specialising in the production of stainless steel. In 1993 Antonio Marcegaglia acquired the Belgian Cotubel group, a distributor of stainless steel products and tubes in France and Benelux, and founded the trading company Central Bright Steel for the distribution of welded tubes in the UK; it also began production of these same products near Birmingham in 1997. In the summer of 1998, a large industrial area in Munhall, near Pittsburgh, was acquired to accommodate the new Marcegaglia USA, which would also incorporate the Damascus-Bishop Tube Company. During the same period, two other companies were formed in the United States, as subsidiaries of the parent companies in Italy: Oskar Usa in Birmingham (Alabama) and Oto Mills Usa in Wheaton (Illinois). In 1999 Antonio Marcegaglia's efforts led to the incorporation of Marcegaglia Iberica, Marcegaglia Ireland, Marcegaglia France, Marcegaglia Austria and Marcegaglia do Brasil, the latter tripling its turnover by 2005, extending its plant and taking the number of its employees to 1000. Meanwhile, in Bremen, in joint venture with the Arbed Group, the first Marcegaglia company to produce quality steel was formed. In 2000, the Group acquired Earcanal of Leioa, Spain. Following the joint venture with Arbed, in 2004 the Marcegaglia Group signed an agreement with the Corus group for the 10-year co-management of its British steelworks on Teesside, guaranteeing the supply at cost price of one million tonnes per year of slabs for the production of coils and sheets. Oto Mills do Brasil was founded in San Paolo in the same year. In 2005 the Group proceeded with the expansion of Marcegaglia do Brasil, and in June Antonio Marcegaglia opened its fourth overseas production plant in Praszka (Poland), to manufacture tubes for refrigeration, panels and corrugated steel sheets. One year later, 20 kilometres away, the plant at Kluczbork was added, for the production of tubes and drawn products. Marcegaglia established Marcegaglia Gulf at Doha, Qatar in 2007. The expansion of its industrial activities continued in 2008 with its entry into China, where, in Yangzhou, 270 km north- west of Shanghai,Agichina24 - Marcegaglia investe a Shanghai it created its first Asian plant for the production of stainless steel tubes and high- precision carbon steel, with the establishment of Marcegaglia Romania at Cluj, and with the start of work on the new production plant at Vladimir, Russia.  Investments and Technology  The Marcegaglia Group has invested a lot of resources in applied research through its subsidiary Oto Mills, the engineering company created for this specific purpose, and Marcegaglia Impianti, the engineering division specialising in the construction of turnkey iron and steel installations (for which it not only supplies the necessary production machinery, but also all the technological experience already \\"proven\\" in the group's establishments), and is now exporting its own know-how also to countries in Eastern Europe, in the Far East and to developing countries. One example of the technology installed in the Marcegaglia Group's production plants is the stainless steel pickling plant and the five-year ‚ÄúRavenna 2000‚Äù project, which resulted in the Ravenna plant becoming the second largest iron and steel centre in Italy, with over 4 million tonnes of semi-finished materials per year, thanks to its new hot galvanisation, coating, cold rolling, and pickling installations, and to its service centre. With the completion of the Ravenna iron and steel plant, opened in December 2001, and of other smaller projects now in operation, the Marcegaglia group is now processing around 5.0 million tonnes of steel per year of finished products.  Employment within the Group  The average age of the employees within the group, which now has 7,000 employees located in over 50 production, administrative and commercial departments, is around 30 years. The company makes various claims concerning its loyalty to its workforce.

He is known primarily for his short fiction. Over the years his short stories have been published in the major fantasy and science fiction magazines, theme anthologies, college readers, and \\"year's best\\" anthologies, including Best American Short Stories 2007, guest-edited by Stephen King. Biography McAllister was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1946. The son of a \\"peripatetic Navy family,\\" his career-Navy-officer \\"Pearl- Harbor-survivor father and an underdog-championing anthropologist mother\\" raised Bruce and his younger brother, Jack, in Washington, D.C., Florida, California, and Italy. McAllister wrote, \\"The theme of the Outsider, the Other, the Alien in the larger sense, runs through almost all of my fiction. That came from being in a military family, from having a sense of being an outsider...\\" He wrote to Dublin-based interviewer Bob Neilson, \\"When I was 4¬Ω I shook hands with natty-dresser US President Harry Truman on a laid-back avenue in Key West, Florida. I had no idea who the guy was, but my momma raised me right. I wanted to be courteous, and he offered, so I shook his hand. ...[A] week after the hand-shake we dropped over to see Mrs. Hemingway, who lived in a little beach house with palms and banana trees and who, though we didn't know her, was hospitable.\\" He told Neilson that as a child he had a sea-shell collection of more than 2000 specimens. This interest appears in his fiction, notably in two 2010 stories, \\"Heart of Hearts\\" and \\"The Courtship of the Queen.\\" McAllister also told Neilson that \\"One of my ancestors was a guy named John Thomson. Immigrated from Scotland to Ireland, then the US in the 1700s. Wore his kilt till the day he died, outlived five wives, had fifteen children. Maybe the right stuff for a frontier, a New World, but I've always been horrified by the thought of having to live with someone like him. The domestic, family side of Braveheart?\\" The family story was that their lineage on his father's side went \\"back to Robert the Bruce, supposedly, and laterally to Ben Franklin, or so they said...along with a Captain McAllister of the Confederate Army.\\" McAllister also thought that his mother \\"was probably part Native American.\\" Another influential childhood memory was this: \\"As far as our father's world went, we had, on the Navy base where we lived in San Diego, the bathyscaphe submersible in our back yard (literally we would have played on it if we could have gotten a decent grip); a year later it would make the deepest dive in the Pacific ever made, with Jacques Piccard and a Navy diver and a civilian scientist‚Äîall of them diving legends if not then, then later).\\" (Neilson commented in his essay about McAllister, \\"You can see where the themes of 'the alien' and 'the natural world'‚Äîthe behavioral sciences and the biological sciences‚Äîcame from in this guy's fiction.\\") Literary archivist and agent Sarah Funke Butler describes an enterprise McAllister undertook when he was 16: When Butler interviewed McAllister decades later, he remarked, \\"The conclusion I came to was that nobody had asked them. New Criticism was about the scholars and the text; writers were cut out of the equation. Scholars would talk about symbolism in writing, but no one had asked the writers.\\" McAllister attended middle school and art school in Italy. He received degrees in English and writing from Claremont McKenna College and the University of California, Irvine. He taught literature and writing at the University of Redlands in southern California for twenty-four years. There, he helped establish and direct the Creative Writing Program, directed both the Professional Writing track of that program and its Communications Internship program, received various teaching and service awards, and was Edith R. White Distinguished Professor of Literature and Writing from 1990 to 1995. Later, he started the company McAllister Coaching, helping writers of books and screenplays with their manuscripts. He lives in Orange, California with his wife, choreographer and Orange Coast College teacher, Amelie Hunter. He has three children from a previous marriage: Annie, Ben, and Liz.

Masterful interior monologues that yield eerie, tingling tension make this terrifying novel one of the most memorable chronicles of the Vietnam war.\\" Library Journal reviewer said, \\"The training and the mission are suffused with madness, and the physical horrors are matched with mental ones. Throughout the narrative are interspersed transcripts of interviews, memos, etc. The apocalyptic ending does strain the willing suspension of disbelief. Still, the story is fascinating, very well told, and likely to appeal to readers of Vietnam War fiction and nonfiction.\\" In a review of The Year's Best Science Fiction Twenty-Fourth Annual Collection, Ernest Lilley described the famous story \\"Kin\\": \\"a twelve-year-old boy is in the act... his 'partner' is an alien assassin he tries to hire to stop the government from killing his unborn sister. There are a lot of interesting bits in this story, and some nice nuance in the actions and ideas. As Gardner points out in his intro, McAllister may not be prolific in his output, but what he does offer us [is] excellent work.\\" Bob Blough reviewed the short story \\"Blue Fire\\" for Tangent Online, the review magazine for short stories of science fiction and fantasy: SF Site reviewed the story \\"Heart of Hearts,\\" \\"another of Bruce McAllister's ongoing series of fantasies about a teenaged American boy in an Italian village.\\" Rich Horton wrote, \\"It's a bittersweet story, beautifully written, sensitively characterized.\\" Blough also reviewed \\"Stamps\\" for Tangent: \\"one of the very few SF stories I can think of which uses stamp collecting as an integral part of the story (Norstrilia by Cordwainer Smith is another one). But if anyone can pull it off it is Bruce McAllister. 'Stamps' is told in a minor key and concerns itself with aliens coming to Earth during the Cuban missile crisis in order to avert nuclear war. The narrator is T'Phu'Bleem, one of ten Arcturians on the planet to save and eventually reveal themselves to the world. He begins collecting postage stamps to understand these earthlings: \\"These stamps were like a puzzle, one that could explain how human beings actually thought and felt... If he didn't try to figure that puzzle out for the sake of the human race and the Ten Galactic Principles, who would?\\" It is a pleasant story that lingers in the mind as an unusual way of describing first contact.\\" After reading \\"The Messenger,\\" Rena Hawkins wrote, \\"Tim's father is dying and the question that tears at him the most is whether his wife, Tim's mother, actually loved him. To answer his father's question and hopefully bring him some peace, Tim travels back in time to meet his parents and see for himself. A short, poignant story about whether you can ever be sure where love is concerned.\\" References Other sources * Bourquin, David Ray. The Work Of Bruce Mcallister: An Annotated Bibliography & Guide.

Education and early life He was son of Thomas Langley, a shoemaker, of Abingdon, Berkshire. He attended John Roysse's Free School in Abingdon (now Abingdon School) from 1622-1627. He was elected a chorister of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1627, and on 6 November 1629 matriculated from Pembroke College, of which he subsequently became Fellow, graduating B.A. in 1632, and proceeding M.A. in 1635, B.D. in 1648, and D.D. in 1649. Career He was appointed rector of St. Mary, Newington, Surrey, by a parliamentary order of 20 June 1643. By a parliamentary order of 10 September 1646 he was named one of the seven presbyterian ministers chosen to prepare the way for the reformation of the University of Oxford by the parliamentary visitors, and was authorised to preach in any church in Oxford he might choose for the purpose of winning the loyal scholars' submission to the parliamentary innovations. On the death, on 10 July 1647, of Thomas Clayton, Master of Pembroke, the fellows elected Henry Wightwick to the vacant post, but their choice was overruled by the parliament. Langley was nominated on 26 August 1647, and his appointment was confirmed by the parliamentary visitors on 8 October following. He became a delegate to the visitors on 30 September in the same year, served as one of the twenty delegates appointed by the proctors (19 May 1648) to answer and act in all things pertaining to the public good of the university, and on 5 July following was constituted member of the committee appointed for the examination of candidates for fellowships and scholarships. Langley was nominated a canon of Christ Church by a parliamentary order of 2 March 1648, and held this post with the mastership of Pembroke till his ejection at the Restoration, when he retired to Tubney, near Abingdon. According to Anthony Wood, Langley took boarders into his house, and taught them logic and philosophy. On the appearance in March 1671‚Äì2 of the Declaration of Indulgence to dissenters, he was chosen with three others to continue a course of preaching within the city of Oxford, in direct opposition to the will of the university authorities. Wood says that he was a constant preacher at Tom Pun's house in Broken Hayes. He died on or about 10 September 1679, and was buried in St. Helen's Church, Abingdon.

He was just old when he died under enemy fire on the off the coast of Norfolk on 6 July 1941. Earnshaw was born in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, to Dorothy Earnshaw. She then married Eric Shires, and the couple had two daughters. Aged 12, he moved with the family to the Granton area of Edinburgh, attending Bellevue School. He left aged 14, and joined the Merchant Navy in February 1941, giving his birth year as 1926 rather than 1927 in order to appear 15, which was the minimum age for recruitment. Earnshaw's body was recovered after the attack and his death certificate, based partly on the false information he had supplied on recruitment, gave his age only as \\"about 15 years\\".

EQANIE awards the so-called Euro-Inf Quality Label to degree programmes that comply with the Euro-Inf Framework Standards and Accreditation Criteria. Background EQANIE‚Äôs founding is to be seen against the background of the Bologna Process, aiming at the creation of a European Higher Education Area. The association emanated from the informal network of stakeholders involved in the Euro-Inf Project co-financed by the European Union under the Socrates-Programme from 2006 until 2008. The Euro-Inf consortium comprised the German Accreditation Agency ASIIN, Hamburg UAS, the University of Paderborn and the Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS).

The Framework represents a quality threshold; those degree programmes that have demonstrated compliance are awarded the Euro-Inf Bachelor / Euro-Inf Master Label. The Accreditation Process An Institution wishing to have one or more of its degrees accredited submits an application to the General Secretary of EQANIE that includes a self-assessment report, compiled in accordance with the Euro-Inf guidelines, a matrix showing how the modules that make up each degree programme satisfy the Eur-Inf expected Learning Outcomes, and supporting documentation that includes the module descriptors, short CV's of academic staff, etc.http://www.eqanie.eu/pages/quality-label.php An audit team studies the documentation and visits the institution. After the visit, the Secretariat prepares a report which is sent to the Institution to be checked for factual accuracy. The auditors then submit their assessment to the Accreditation Committee which decides on the outcome. For a positive decision, the degree is added to the list of accredited degrees on the EQANIE website ( www.eqanie.eu). EQANIE can also appoint national agencies to award the Euro- Inf labels on its behalf and has already appointed ASIIN in Germany.http://www.eqanie.eu/pages/quality-label/authorised-agencies.php The General Assembly The General Assembly is the highest decision-making body of EQANIE.

Career  Dixit founded the \\"Azadi Bachao Andolan\\" (Save Freedom Movement) in the early 1990s as a campaign to protect Indian industries, at a time when multi-national corporations were increasing their presence in India as a part of a trend towards globalisation. An aide to Ramdev, Dixit served as the national secretary of Ramdev's anti-corruption organisation Bharat Swabhiman Andolan. During his career as an activist, Dixit demanded decentralisation of the Indian taxation system, stating that the existing system was the core reason for bureaucratic corruption. He claimed that 80 percent of tax revenue was used to pay the salaries of politicians and bureaucrats and compared the modern budget system of the Indian government to the earlier British budget system in India.  Death  Dixit died on 30 November 2010 in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, due to poison in his meal. Dixit allegedly refused to undergo emergency medical treatment, citing his distrust of Allopathic medicine, leading to his death. However, his death is a subject of controversy as no autopsy was performed, despite some of Dixit's followers being suspicious that the actual cause of death was poisoning. There were accusations against Baba Ramdev of a conspiracy to kill Dixit, but these allegations were rejected by the Supreme Court of India.

The name is derived from the Slovene common noun praprot 'fern' and, like similar names (e.g., Praproƒçe, Praprotno Brdo, Papraƒçe = ), originally referred to the local vegetation.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 326. The village was known as Prapretsche in German in the past. The name of the settlement was changed from Prapreƒçe to Prapreƒçe pri ≈†entjerneju in 1953.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996. Database. Ljubljana: Geografski in≈°titut ZRC SAZU, DZS. History The village was first mentioned in written sources in 1304, when the Sicherstein family transferred the manor and ten farms there into the feudal possession of a certain Martin and his wife. The village later came under the control of the Counts of Celje and then the Prince-Bishopric of Freising. In 1423, two brothers named Freichawer from Vrhovo are recorded as operating two mills in Prapreƒçe belonging to the Prince-Bishopric of Freising. In modern history, the surname Vrtaƒçiƒç is particularly common in the village. Cultural heritage Archaeological finds at two sites close to the village have shown Late Iron Age and Roman-era occupation.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference numbers e≈°d 8647 and 26005 References External links *Prapreƒçe pri ≈†entjerneju on Geopedia Category:Populated places in the Municipality of ≈†entjernej ","title":"Prapreƒçe pri ≈†entjerneju"},{"id":"26077864","text":"Dark Shadows: Echoes of Insanity is a Big Finish Productions original dramatic reading based on the long-running American horror soap opera series Dark Shadows.

Yongjiacaris represents the second report of freshwater caridean shrimp from the Mesozoic. The name of the genus Yongjiacaris refers to Yongjia County, in the Zhejiang Province of China, while the species name Y. zhejiangensis is derived from the province name. Yonjiacaris was formally described by Alessandro Garassino, Shen Yanbin, Frederick R. Schram, and Rod S. Taylor in 2002. It is described from 138 specimens discovered in the C Member of the Moshishan Formation of Yongjia County, and from specimens found in the Showchang Formation near Jiande, both in southeastern China. These two correlative rock units date to the Barremian age of the Early Cretaceous; volcanic rocks in the C Member of the Moshishan Formation are dated to 120 million years old, and volcanic rocks in the Showchang Formation are dated to 118 million years ago. The C Member of the Moshishan Formation is a heterogeneous rock unit including sandstone, shale, tuff, conglomerate, and rhyolite, while the Showchang Formation is dominantly sandstone and mudstone. The types of plants present in the C Member and the Showchang Formation (relatively abundant ferns and Bennettitales, rare members of the Ginkgoaceae) and characteristics of the plants, such as leaf form and cuticle thickness, indicate a relatively hot and dry climate. The two rock units have fossil assemblages including plants, charophytes, bivalves, ostracods, conchostracans, and insects. While other genera from the family Palaemonidae are known from the Aptian age in the lower Cretaceous period, Yongjiacaris represents the first member described from the Barremian age.

It is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the fields of computer science, linguistics and cognitive science. History One of the first problems to be studied in the 1950s, shortly after the invention of computers, was an LCT problem, namely the translation of human languages. The large amounts of funding poured into machine translation testifies to the perceived importance of the field, right from the beginning. It was also in this period that scholars started to develop theories of language and communication based on scientific methods. In the case of language, it was Noam Chomsky who refines the goal of linguistics as a quest for a formal description of language,Noam Chomsky, Syntactic Structures, London: Mouton, 1957. whilst Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver provided a mathematical theory that linked communication with information.A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Cm.bell-labs.com (1998-05-18). Retrieved on 2011-03-21. Computers and related technologies have provided a physical and conceptual framework within which scientific studies concerning the notion of communication within a computational framework could be pursued. Indeed, this framework has been fruitful on a number of levels. For a start, it has given birth to a new discipline, known as natural language processing (NLP), or computational linguistics (CL). This discipline studies, from a computational perspective, all levels of language from the production of speech to the meanings of texts and dialogues. And over the past 40 years, NLP has produced an impressive computational infrastructure of resources, techniques, and tools for analyzing sound structure (phonology), word structure (morphology), grammatical structure (syntax) and meaning structure (semantics). As well as being important for language-based applications, this computational infrastructure makes it possible to investigate the structure of human language and communication at a deeper scientific level than was ever previously possible. Moreover, NLP fits in naturally with other branches of computer science, and in particular, with artificial intelligence (AI).AITopics / NaturalLanguage. Aaai.org. Retrieved on 2011-03-21. From an AI perspective, language use is regarded as a manifestation of intelligent behaviour by an active agent. The emphasis in AI- based approaches to language and communication is on the computational infrastructure required to integrate linguistic performance into a general theory of intelligent agents that includes, for example, learning generalizations on the basis of particular experience, the ability to plan and reason about intentionally produced utterances, the design of utterances that will fulfill a particular set of goals. Such work tends to be highly interdisciplinary in nature, as it needs to draw on ideas from such fields as linguistics, cognitive psychology, and sociology. LCT draws on and incorporates knowledge and research from all these fields. Today Language and communication are so fundamental to human activity that it is not at all surprising to find that Language and Communication Technologies affect all major areas of society, including health, education, finance, commerce, and travel. Modern LCT is based on a dual tradition of symbols and statistics. This means that nowadays research on language requires access to large databases of information about words and their properties, to large scale computational grammars, to computational tools for working with all levels of language, and to efficient inference systems for performing reasoning. By working computationally it is possible to get to grips with the deeper structure of natural languages, and in particular, to model the crucial interactions between the various levels of language and other cognitive faculties. Relevant areas of research in LCT include: *Machine translation *Information retrieval *Ontologies *Formal semantics *Information and knowledge representation *Question answering *Speech recognition and synthesis *Models of human language processing and understanding *Psycholinguistics Educational programs The increasing interest in the field is proved by the existence of several European Masters in this dynamic research area:Erasmus Mundus ‚Äì Action 1 ‚Äì Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses (EMMCs) EACEA.

It is intended to allow Canadian farm employers to hire workers from Mexico and the Caribbean on temporary visas during the planting and harvesting seasons when employers are unable to hire local workers to fulfill their labour demands. The program, administered jointly by Employment and Social Development Canada with Citizenship and Immigration Canada, is available to those who are at least 18 years of age, from one of the participating countries, qualify under the immigration laws and the sending country and agree to the employment contract. Those workers are eligible for the Canada Pension Plan and certain Employment Insurance benefits (excluding \\"special benefits\\" such as maternal, parental and compassionate care benefits). Workers are also subject to income tax laws.  History  The issue of a lack of workers was first recognized in the mid-1960s when there were not enough workers to fill the needs of farms that needed their crop picked as well as planted at the beginning of the season. The government saw a need to form a program to help fill the gap of labor and farms in need of workers. By 1966 the Seasonal Agriculture Workers Program was formed and utilized by Ontario. It began as a partnership between Canada and the Caribbean country of Jamaica and has since grown to many other Caribbean countries and Mexico. As of 2005 there were 18,000 migrant workers coming into the country annually, mainly working in Ontario.

In Scotland it is typically prepared using a hot water crust pastry, while in other areas the dish may not have any crust. Preparation A slice of macaroni pie Typical ingredients in macaroni pie include macaroni pasta, cheese, milk, butter, flour, salt, pepper and various spices. Additional ingredients sometimes used include onion and bread crumbs. Other ingredients may also be used. It can be prepared as a low-fat dish using reduced fat cheese and skim milk. Some versions, such as those in Scotland, are prepared using a pie crust, while others are not. It may be served sliced into wedges. By region Caribbean In the Caribbean, macaroni pie is typically prepared without using a pie crust. In the Caribbean, it is sometimes consumed cold, which may be referred to as \\"Caribbean style\\". Barbados Macaroni pie is a popular dish in Barbados, where it is commonly consumed as a side dish along with fried fish. It is sometimes prepared as a spicy dish, using spices such as black pepper, curry powder and hot sauces. Trinidad and Tobago The dish is very popular in Trinidad and Tobago and is often available as a common dish at lunches and dinners. It has been described as a staple food in Tobago. Cheddar cheese, a key ingredient in the dish, was brought to Trinidad by English peoples. It is sometimes served as a side dish accompanied with stewed meats. Finland The Finnish macaroni casserole or makaro(o)nilaatikko is a popular dish made with elbow pasta and egg-and-milk mixture, and baked until it sets. Often saut√©ed minced meat (and optionally onion) is added, thus creating a lihamakaronilaatikko (literally, meat-macaroni casserole). The casserole may be topped before baking with breadcrumbs and grated cheese and/or knobs of butter, to form a crunchy crust. Makaronilaatikko is typically served with tomato ketchup and pickles such as gherkins. Greece Pastitsio Pastitsio is a type of macaroni pie in Greek cuisine prepared using elbow macaroni noodles and various additional ingredients. Italy In Italian cuisine the macaroni pie () is a traditional dish in several cities, with a long tradition originating from the pastizzi prepared by the chefs active in the Italian courts of the Renaissance: the most well known, filled with pigeon meat and truffles, comes from Ferrara, while also Rome (whose pasticcio, filled with chicken innards and topped with cream, has a clear Renaissance origin) Naples and Sicily have their own version. The Sicilian Timballo has been immortalised by Luchino Visconti in his movie Il Gattopardo. Scotland In Scotland, macaroni pie is prepared by filling a Scotch pie shell with macaroni and cheese and baking it. Greggs sold it in Scotland, but stopped doing so in June 2015, which spurred an online campaign and petition for the company to return the dish. Several prominent Scottish politicians signed the petition, including Nicola Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale. United States In the United States, macaroni pie has been and continues to sometimes be referred to as \\"baked macaroni and cheese\\". It is a part of the cuisine of the Southern United States. In the United States during the mid-1900s, the word \\"spaghetti\\" was typically used to refer to macaroni, and spaghetti noodles were used to prepare macaroni pie during this time period. An American recipe from 1870 includes grated ham as an ingredient in the dish, and also calls for the meat from squirrels, birds or wild ducks. An American recipe from 1892 includes pork and ham in the dish's preparation.

Life He is tentatively identified (by John Venn in Alumni Cantabrigienses as well as Alexander Gordon in the Dictionary of National Biography) with William Manning (son of William Manning) who was born at Cockfield, Suffolk. This Manning was educated at Stowmarket and admitted a sizar of Christ's College, Cambridge, on 25 October 1649, aged 16, Henry More being his tutor. He was one of three brothers, all holding benefices till the Uniformity Act of 1662, and members, while beneficed, of congregational churches; John (died 1694), who entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1633, and graduated M.A. in 1641, was perpetual curate of Peasenhall, Suffolk; Samuel was perpetual curate of Walpole, Suffolk. William was perpetual curate of Middleton, Suffolk, and ejected for nonconformity by the Act of 1662. William Manning at that date settled at Peasenhall, and took out a licence under the indulgence of 1672 as a congregational teacher in his own house there; his brother John, who remained at Peasenhall after his ejection, took out a similar licence. According to GordonGordon, Alexander. Heads of English Unitarian History Manning seems to be the only instance of a Congregational minister ejected by the Uniformity Act 1662 who later adopted fully Anti- Trinitarian views. In 1686 he published a small volume of sermons, broad in spirit, but evangelical in doctrine. He was in the habit of preaching occasionally at Lowestoft, Suffolk, and this brought him into acquaintance with Thomas Emlyn, who in 1689 was chaplain at Rose Hall to Sir Robert Rich, a member of the presbyterian congregation at Lowestoft. Manning and Emlyn both read William Sherlock's Vindication of the Trinity (1690). Manning made up his mind in favour of Socinianism, and argued strongly for it in his correspondence with Emlyn, which began on Emlyn's removal to Dublin (1691), and lasted till Manning's death.Some of letters are printed in the Monthly Repository.\\"In 1690 and 1693 Sherlock published volumes on the doctrine of the Trinity which helped rather than injured the Socinian cause, and involved him in a warm controversy\\" Page 850 of the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Manning then looked for converts with some success, carrying a large part of his Peasenhall congregation with him, but failing with John Hurrion, at that time student for the ministry (1698) at Heveningham, near Walpole. His chief local opponent was Nathaniel Parkhurst, vicar of Yoxford, Suffolk. He became very deaf, and gave up preaching (before 1704). He died on 13 February 1711, aged (as was said) 81, and was buried at Peasenhall on 15 February. He was married in 1652; his wife Priscilla died on 14 June 1710, aged 80.

KBRU airs a mainstream rock format branded as \\"94.7 The Brew\\". Owned by iHeartMedia, its transmitter is located in Northeast Oklahoma City, and studios are located at the 50 Penn Place building on the Northwest side. Prior stations on 94.7 in Oklahoma City The current KBRU license is the third to operate on 94.7 in Oklahoma City. KOCY-FM The first was KOCY-FM, which was the first FM station to broadcast in the state, opening on September 16, 1946. Initially broadcasting on 98.5 MHz, KOCY-FM was co-owned with KOCY (1340 AM). KOCY-FM quickly increased its effective radiated power, to 3,000 watts in January 1947; it changed frequencies to 94.7 in mid-1947. A year later, KOCY-FM activated a new transmitter site and increased its power to 70,000 watts, claiming \\"the tallest exclusive FM tower in the world\\". KOCY-FM was additionally used to feed eight AM stations in a statewide network that began operations in September. KOCY-FM ceased operations in 1950. Its tower was acquired by station KOMA (1520 AM) for use in broadcasting television. KEFM/KMWC It would be another eight years before a new 94.7 station operated; on August 17, 1958, Carl E. Williams opened KEFM, offering a \\"fine music\\" format. The fine music outlet was hit with staff turmoil in 1960 when it moved to a more upbeat music policy during the daytime hours; former station manager Earl Thomas claimed no involvement with the change. 1963 saw an even larger change; the station moved to Midwest City and adopted new KMWC call letters to reflect its home. KMWC, along with KJEM-AM-FM, carried daily radio broadcasts from Tinker Air Force Base. However, Williams made an ill-advised move; he leased the station for six months in 1964 to Marlin Joe Pershall without Federal Communications Commission approval. In March 1965, the FCC fined Williams $1,000. Later that year, the station was deleted, and the FCC set aside the fine that December. History KEBC The Electronic Broadcasting Company applied on October 9, 1965, to build a new FM radio station on 94.7 in Oklahoma City. The FCC approved its application for a construction permit on August 17, 1966, and KEBC‚Äînamed for the owner‚Äîsigned on in May 1967. The station was a country music outlet, broadcasting from studios at 3920 SE 104th Street on the city's southeast side; in 1970, the studios were moved to 830 SW 31st Street. In 1971, Ralph Tyler and Harold McEwen bought a majority share in KEBC, and a new tower facility followed in 1973. KEBC established itself as a force in the market; it pulled double-digit ratings in each year between 1979 and 1982, fighting with KKNG and KTOK for the top spot in Oklahoma City. However, KEBC gained a formidable competitor on May 27, 1982, when KXXY-FM flipped to country. The more aggressive KXXY-FM edged ahead of KEBC in 1983 and would widen its lead to eight ratings points by the end of the decade. While KXXY-FM surged, KEBC was sold several times. Van Wagner Broadcasting, which only owned two outlets in Michigan, bought the station from Ralph Tyler for $4 million in 1986. Two years later, Van Wagner sold KEBC to Independence Broadcasting for $3.9 million. Independence would see a return on its investment when Clear Channel Communications, forerunner to iHeartMedia, acquired KEBC for $7.5 million in 1993. Alternative, soft rock, and alternative again After 28 years in the country format, KEBC relaunched on July 3, 1996 as an alternative rock station known as \\"95X\\", adopting the call letters KNRX. It was the market's first station in the format. However, less than 18 months later, another change came. On November 7, 1997, after repeating the song \\"A Change Would Do You Good\\" by Sheryl Crow for an hour, KNRX became soft adult contemporary KQSR, seeking to target the 35‚Äì44 audience and citing the duplication of alternative music on stations in other formats in Oklahoma City. The station returned to alternative on July 8, 2002 and became KHBZ-FM \\"The Buzz\\", stunting beforehand with a buzzing noise played over the soft rock songs and notifying listeners that their \\"technicians were working to get 'the Buzz' out\\". On January 11, 2008, at 5 p.m., the station began stunting with all-Metallica, relaunching the following Monday with an active rock format. Despite a format emphasizing active rock and some classic rock titles, KHBZ-FM was still placed on the alternative rock panel by Radio & Records/Nielsen BDS. By the spring of 2009, KHBZ had adopted Clear Channel's syndicated Premium Choice active rock format, becoming musically identical outside of morning drive to sister stations KIOC in Beaumont, Texas and WHRL in Albany, New York. The Brew On December 29, 2009, The Buzz gave way to KBRU \\"The Brew\\", a mainly 1980s-based rock outlet billed as \\"Classic Rock's Next Generation\\". Since adopting the Brew moniker, KBRU has shifted between rock formats on several occasions. In 2012, the station began playing more recent titles, bringing it closer to the music mix on KHBZ-FM before the format flip; later in the year, the station added more classic rock titles, eventually moving fully to classic rock as a competitor to KQOB. Since 2015, when the station moved back to mainstream rock, KBRU has oscillated between classic and mainstream rock formats. Translators KBRU's only translator carries its HD2 subchannel, a regional Mexican format known as El Patr√≥n.

According to the 1901 census he was living with his parents and older brother Percy Charles Ross in Birmingham and his occupation was that of a printer compositor.England and Wales Census, 1901, District: Aston, County: Warwickshire, archive reference RG13. He worked for Lever Brothers until 1910, then joined advertising agents S. H. Benson of Kingsway. He managed the printing department and became a director in 1936. After his retirement in 1947 he became an honorary fellow of the Institute of Incorporated Practitioners in Advertising. Alongside his professional career as a printer and advertiser, he wrote seven books as well as some articles that were all published under the literary pseudonym of Frank Morison. His publications did not contain any author or publisher's blurb that described his professional credentials or occupation. During the 1930s some book reviewers formed an impression that he must be a lawyer.See Rev. D. Gardner Miller, ‚ÄúWho Moved The Stone?‚Äù Otago Daily Times, August 9 1930, 27.‚ÄúTalks With Young Men,‚Äù Australian Christian Commonwealth, April 27, 1934, 10; ‚ÄúThe Triumph of Easter,‚Äù Queensland Times, April 16, 1938, 11.‚ÄúThe Glorious Message of Easter: He Is Alive,‚Äù Derby Evening Telegraph, Saturday, April 16 1949, 3. This impression emerged after the publication of his book Who Moved the Stone? The claim that he was a lawyer was investigated by Ross Clifford, the Australian theologian and former barrister, and he established that Morison/Ross was never licensed in England to be either a solicitor or a barrister.Ross Clifford, Leading Lawyers‚Äô Case for the Resurrection (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada: Canadian Institute for Law, Theology and Public Policy, 1996), 120-123. In 1916 he enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps serving as an instructor in aerial bombing as well as working in the general administration of the Air Ministry‚Äôs Directorate of Intelligence (also known as MI7).Hew Strachan, ‚ÄúStrategic Bombing and the Question of Civilian Casualties up to 1945,‚Äù in Firestorm: The Bombing of Dresden 1945, Ed.

After the War he returned to work at Benson's advertising agency. Apart from his work as an advertiser and author, he was a keen colour cinematographer and amateur astronomer. He married Annie Elizabeth Mills in 1915 in Birmingham.England & Wales Marriage Index, 1915, Vol. 6d, 792, District: Birmingham, County: Warwickshire. In 1917 their only daughter, Margaret Lilian Ross, was born in Birmingham.England & Wales Birth Index, 1917, Vol. 6d, 925, District: Aston, County: Warwickshire. According to the obituary in The Times he died on 14 September 1950 at his home in Headley Down, Hampshire. He was buried in the church grounds of St. Luke Anglican Church, Grayshott, East Hampshire on 18 September 1950.See entry No. 776 \\"Albert Henry Ross\\" in Surrey, England, Church of England Burials, 1813‚Äì1987, Grayshott, St Luke(1950), p 97, available to subscribers Writing Ross' first book, which was published in 1908 and re-released in 1911, was a character study of the preacher J. H. Jowett (1863‚Äì1923) who spent several years in pulpit ministry at the Congregational Church in Carrs Lane, Birmingham.Frank Morison, J. H. Jowett, M.A. of Birmingham: A Critical Appreciation (Birmingham: Allday, 1908). Re-released as J. H. Jowett M.A., D.D.: A Character Study (London: James Clarke, 1911). He self-published two other works in 1919 and 1927.Frank Morison, A Method of Study for Preachers (London: Study Bureau, 1919), and The Psychology of Public Speaking: introductory manual to the Study Bureau course in public speaking (West Croydon: The Study Bureau, 1927). He is best known today for writing the book Who Moved the Stone? It was first published in 1930 in England by Faber & Faber and has been repeatedly reprinted (in 1944, 1955, 1958, 1962, 1977, 1981, 1983, 1987, 1996 and 2006) as well as translated into several languages.Other language versions include: Nani aliyelivingirisha jiwe? (Dodoma, Tanganyika [now Tanzania]: Central Tanganyika Press, 1930);Den Tomme Grav (Copenhagen: Hasselbach, 1931); Le Tombeau Vide (Paris: Editions Contemporaines, 1932); Wer W√§ltze den Stein? (Hamburg: Christian Wagner Verlag, 1949); Het Lege Graf (Haarlam, Netherlands: N. V. Drukkerij de Spaarnestad, 1953); La R√©surrection: mythe ou r√©aliti√©?

The book analyses biblical texts about the events related to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. Ross was skeptical regarding the resurrection of Jesus, and set out to analyse the sources and to write a short paper entitled Jesus ‚Äì the Last Phase to demonstrate the apparent myth. However, in compiling his notes, he came to be convinced of the truth of the resurrection, and set out his reasoning in the book. T. S. Eliot, a literary consultant and an editorial board member at Faber & Faber publishers, read the manuscript when it was submitted for publication. Eliot was enthusiastic about the text and recommended that Faber & Faber publish the book.Eliot‚Äôs report, dated 18 December 1929, in The Letters of T. S. Eliot: Volume 5: 1930‚Äì1931, Ed. Valerie Eliot and John Haffenden (London: Faber, 2014/New Haven: Yale University Press, 2015), 38. The book was released in time for Lent in 1930 and Eliot passed complimentary copies for review to authors such as G. K. Chesterton.Letter to G. K. Chesterton, dated February 19, 1930, Letters of T. S. Eliot, Volume 5 1930‚Äì31, 107. In Chesterton's review, he remarked that he picked the book up \\"under the impression that it was a detective story\\" and found that the case for the resurrection was \\"treated in such a logical and even legal manner.\\"G. K. Chesterton, ‚ÄúOur Note Book,‚Äù The Illustrated London News, April 5 1930, 554. Many people have become Christian after reading the book, and writers including John Warwick Montgomery and Josh McDowell, have used his book in their own discussions on the resurrection.See John Warwick Montgomery, Human Rights and Human Dignity (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1986), 151 ; Josh McDowell, The Resurrection Factor (San Bernardino: Here's Life, 1981) p 12. Dorothy L. Sayers stated that she relied on Morison's discussion of the trial of Jesus while writing her play The Man Born To Be King.Dorothy L. Sayers, The Man Born To Be King: A Play- Cycle on the Life of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1990 [1943]), 29. (Sayers had been Ross's colleague while she worked as an advertising copywriter at S. H. Benson in London from 1922 to 1931.)On Sayer's career at S. H. Benson see Alzine Stone Dale, Maker and Craftsman: The Story of Dorothy L. Sayers (Lincoln, New England: iUniverse, 2003) and Barbara Reynolds, Dorothy L. Sayers: Her Life and Soul (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1993). After the release of Who Moved the Stone, the editor of the London newspaper The Sphere invited Ross to contribute articles to a religious column that were published from 1930 to 1934.Frank Morison, ‚ÄúI Was Crucified,‚Äù The Sphere, October 25, 1930, 162. ‚ÄúThe Lord Gave the Land to the People?‚Äù The Sphere, June 27, 1931, 586. ‚ÄúThe Pope‚Äôs Decree: The Date of the Crucifixion,‚Äù The Sphere, January 21, 1933, 76. ‚ÄúThe Origin of Twelfth Night,‚Äù The Sphere, January 13, 1934, 64. His next book was a science-fiction novel Sunset.Sunset (London: Faber & Faber, 1932; New York: The Century Co, 1932). The novel featured the radio astronomy experiments of an English physicist John Byford who sent wireless messages into outer space using a photo electric cell gadget. He eventually received a reply from Nerina who was living on a planet three light years from earth. Life on that planet was sterile and dying from cosmic wave radiation. Byford is murdered by criminals who seem to originate from both Germanic and Slavic parts of Europe. A fake message which is attributed to Byford appears in a Russian newspaper and is then syndicated throughout the English-speaking world. The message is based on his contact with Nerina and includes the fruits of eight years research in astronomy and mathematics. The message claims that within two months all life on earth will perish from the same cosmic wave radiation that has ruined Nerina's planet. The novel depicts different reactions to \\"the Sunset Scare\\" such as a London advertising agency, major newspapers, and the Stock Exchange reacting to financial panic. There are acts of mob violence as food prices soar. Some wealthy financiers seem to be making lots of money from the panic. In London a large crowd listens to a sermon delivered by the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral based on the Book of Job and the church service climaxes with an organ rendition of part of Handel's Messiah. The plot includes the investigations of the Archbishop of Canterbury who analyses the message attributed to Byford and concludes that it is a fake. The last portion of the novel includes notes about Byford's experiments and his reflections on the meaning of life that centre on questions about the universe having a purpose, animal cruelty, and passages that he has meditated upon from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri. The Papyri were discovered in Egypt in 1903 and contain statements attributed to Jesus that are not recorded in the Bible.See Ralph Straus book review in The Sunday Times, March 6, 1932, 9. After spending four years in background research and writing, his book War on Great Cities was published in 1937.War on Great Cities: A Study of the Facts (London: Faber & Faber, 1937). He examined the impact of air raids in World War I, and considered the future of aerial bombardment in warfare. For this he interviewed both London eyewitnesses of the World War I bombing raids, but also German officers who carried them out, and his descriptions of these raids account for about three quarters of the book.See book review Edwin Colston Shepherd, ‚ÄúThe Terror from the Air,‚Äù Times Literary Supplement, February 13, 1937, 101. The book also reflects his background as a member of the Royal Flying Corps and his time spent in Military Intelligence. In the section \\"Looking to the future\\", he expressed concern over the possible future use of chemical bombing, but discounted 'bacteria bombs' as a madman's weapon. He also discussed the impact that concentrated incendiary bombing might have on large cities such as London. He subsequently wrote the book And Pilate said ‚Äî after pursuing research in Palestine, during which he also traced the water supply in ancient Jerusalem.And Pilate Said: ‚Äî A New Study of the Roman Procurator (London: Rich & Cowan, 1939; New York: Scribner‚Äôs, 1940). He spent one month in Palestine and received on the ground assistance from the Swedish-born specialist photographer Gastgifvar Eric Matson. Matson, who was a member of the American Colony in Jerusalem, supplied more than fifty photographic plates that are reproduced in the book.And Pilate Said pp 11, 97-98. The book was dedicated to Mr and Mrs Gatson. He argued in favour of the historical authenticity of the portrait concerning Pilate's role in the trial of Jesus as presented in the four gospels collected in the New Testament. The end of the book included another discussion about the resurrection as an event.See the reviews in Bishop Stewart of Chicago, ‚ÄúBooks: On the Resurrection of Our Lord,‚Äù The Layman‚Äôs Magazine of the Living Church, 3 (April 1940): 29.

If built as planned, the 40 GW project would be the largest power station in the world. Location The project would be located across the Congo River, approximately , upstream of where the river empties into the Atlantic Ocean. This is approximately , southwest of Kinshasa, the capital and largest city of the DR Congo. This is the site of the Inga Falls and is the location of the 351 MW Inga 1 Hydropower Station and the 1,424 MW Inga 2 Hydropower Station, approximately upstream of Matadi, the country's largest port. Overview The project would involved building a dam across the south of the Bundi River valley where it meets the Congo, then diverting the Congo from above the waterfalls into the north of the valley to create a huge reservoir. It is anticipated that the vertical drop, the volume and velocity of water flow at this site, can support a series of hydroelectric power stations, each with generation capacity ranging from 4 to 8 GW for a total of 40 GW for the whole complex. Inga III Power Station with capacity of 4.8 GW, would be the first power station in the series, to be constructed. The current design allows for the independent development of the different power stations in the series, as well as the phased development of each station. Each of the seven dams could be owned by different investors. Financing The total construction bill for Grand Inga has been calculated to be as high as $80 billion. The World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the African Development Bank, have provided funding for feasibility and environmental impact studies. In 2016, the World Bank cancelled its support for the Grand Inga Project. It is expected that the power stations will be developed as a public private partnership project. Recent developments In June 2020, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo resolved to present the project to the regional heads of State and explore the market on the continent for the power generated. They have recruited the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's Development in their efforts to get the power station built. South Africa has indicated willingness to buy 2.5 GW of the dam's output. Nigeria is interested in buying 3 GW and the Congolese mines in Katanga Province are interested in 1.3 GW.

Important problems such as factorization and stability of m-D systems (m > 1) have recently attracted the interest of many researchers and practitioners. The reason is that the factorization and stability is not a straightforward extension of the factorization and stability of 1-D systems because, for example, the fundamental theorem of algebra does not exist in the ring of m-D (m > 1) polynomials.  Applications  Multidimensional systems or m-D systems are the necessary mathematical background for modern digital image processing with many applications in biomedicine, X-ray technology and satellite communications. There are also some studies combining m-D systems with partial differential equations (PDEs).  Linear multidimensional state-space model  A state-space model is a representation of a system in which the effect of all \\"prior\\" input values is contained by a state vector. In the case of an m-d system, each dimension has a state vector that contains the effect of prior inputs relative to that dimension. The collection of all such dimensional state vectors at a point constitutes the total state vector at the point. Consider a uniform discrete space linear two-dimensional (2d) system that is space invariant and causal. It can be represented in matrix-vector form as follows: Represent the input vector at each point (i,j) by u(i,j), the output vector by y(i,j) the horizontal state vector by R(i,j) and the vertical state vector by S(i,j). Then the operation at each point is defined by: : \\\\begin{align} R(i+1,j) & = A_1R(i,j) + A_2S(i,j) + B_1u(i,j) \\\\\\\\\\\\ S(i,j+1) & = A_3R(i,j) + A_4S(i,j) + B_2u(i,j) \\\\\\\\\\\\ y(i,j) & = C_1R(i,j) +C_2S(i,j) + Du(i,j) \\\\end{align} where A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2 and D are matrices of appropriate dimensions. These equations can be written more compactly by combining the matrices: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} R(i+1,j) \\\\\\\\\\\\ S(i,j+1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ y(i,j) \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A_1 & A_2 & B_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_3 & A_4 & B_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_1 & C_2 & D \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} R(i,j) \\\\\\\\\\\\ S(i,j) \\\\\\\\\\\\ u(i,j) \\\\end{bmatrix} Given input vectors u(i,j) at each point and initial state values, the value of each output vector can be computed by recursively performing the operation above.  Multidimensional transfer function  A discrete linear two-dimensional system is often described by a partial difference equation in the form: \\\\sum_{p,q=0,0}^{m,n}a_{p,q}y(i-p,j-q) = \\\\sum_{p,q=0,0}^{m,n}b_{p,q}x(i-p,j-q) where x(i,j) is the input and y(i,j) is the output at point (i,j) and a_{p,q} and b_{p,q} are constant coefficients. To derive a transfer function for the system the 2d Z-transform is applied to both sides of the equation above. : \\\\sum_{p,q=0,0}^{m,n} a_{p,q}z_1^{-p}z_2^{-q}Y(z_1,z_2) = \\\\sum_{p,q=0,0}^{m,n}b_{p,q}z_1^{-p}z_2^{-q}X(z_1,z_2) Transposing yields the transfer function T(z_1,z_2): : T(z_1,z_2) = {Y(z_1,z_2) \\\\over X(z_1,z_2)} = {\\\\sum_{p,q=0,0}^{m,n}b_{p,q}z_1^{-p}z_2^{-q} \\\\over \\\\sum_{p,q=0,0}^{m,n}a_{p,q}z_1^{-p}z_2^{-q}} So given any pattern of input values, the 2d Z-transform of the pattern is computed and then multiplied by the transfer function T(z_1,z_2) to produce the Z-transform of the system output.  Realization of a 2d transfer function  Often an image processing or other md computational task is described by a transfer function that has certain filtering properties, but it is desired to convert it to state-space form for more direct computation. Such conversion is referred to as realization of the transfer function. Consider a 2d linear spatially invariant causal system having an input-output relationship described by: : Y(z_1,z_2) = {\\\\sum_{p,q=0,0}^{m,n}b_{p,q}z_1^{-p}z_2^{-q} \\\\over \\\\sum_{p,q=0,0}^{m,n}a_{p,q}z_1^{-p}z_2^{-q}}X(z_1,z_2) Two cases are individually considered 1) the bottom summation is simply the constant 1 2)the top summation is simply a constant k. Case 1 is often called the ‚Äúall-zero‚Äù or ‚Äúfinite impulse response‚Äù case, whereas case 2 is called the ‚Äúall-pole‚Äù or ‚Äúinfinite impulse response‚Äù case. The general situation can be implemented as a cascade of the two individual cases. The solution for case 1 is considerably simpler than case 2 and is shown below.  Example: all zero or finite impulse response  : Y(z_1,z_2) = \\\\sum_{p,q=0,0}^{m,n}b_{p,q}z_1^{-p}z_2^{-q}X(z_1,z_2) The state-space vectors will have the following dimensions: : R (1 \\\\times m),\\\\quad S (1 \\\\times n),\\\\quad x (1 \\\\times 1) and y (1 \\\\times 1) Each term in the summation involves a negative (or zero) power of z_1 and of z_2 which correspond to a delay (or shift) along the respective dimension of the input x(i,j). This delay can be effected by placing 1‚Äôs along the super diagonal in the A_1. and A_4 matrices and the multiplying coefficients b_{i,j} in the proper positions in the A_2. The value b_{0,0} is placed in the upper position of the B_1 matrix, which will multiply the input x(i,j) and add it to the first component of the R_{i,j} vector. Also, a value of b_{0,0} is placed in the D matrix which will multiply the input x(i,j) and add it to the output y. The matrices then appear as follows: : A_1 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} : A_2 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} : A_3 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} b_{1,n} & b_{2,n} & b_{3,n} & \\\\cdots & b_{m-1,n} & b_{m,n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{1,n-1} & b_{2,n-1} & b_{3,n-1} & \\\\cdots & b_{m-1, n-1} & b_{m,n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{1,n-2} & b_{2,n-2} & b_{3,n-2} & \\\\cdots & b_{m-1, n-2} & b_{m,n-2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{1,2} & b_{2,2} & b_{3,2} & \\\\cdots & b_{m-1,2} & b_{m,2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{1,1} & b_{2,1} & b_{3,1} & \\\\cdots & b_{m-1,1} & b_{m,1} \\\\end{bmatrix} A_4 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} : B_1 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} : B_2 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} b_{0,n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,n-2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{0,1} \\\\end{bmatrix} : C_1 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} b_{1,0} & b_{2,0} & b_{3,0} & \\\\cdots & b_{m-1,0} & b_{m,0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} : C_2 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} : D = \\\\begin{bmatrix}b_{0,0} \\\\end{bmatrix}  References  Category:Digital imaging Category:Partial differential equations Category:Stability theory Category:Multidimensional signal processing ","title":"Multidimensional system"},{"id":"26078326","text":"The Nagpur Pact was concluded between Indian political leaders on 28 September 1953.

Leaders like M S Aney and Brijlal Biyani submitted a memorandum to the State Reorganisation Commission (SR) for a separate Vidarbha State. The SRC, after considering the memorandum and all other related aspects, favoured a separate \\"Vidarbha State\\" with Nagpur as capital. But even after the recommendation of SRC headed by Fazal Ali, Vidarbha was made part of bilingual Bombay State in 1956 and Nagpur city lost the capital status. Nagpur thus became the only city in independent India to lose state capital status, after being a capital of India's biggest state (by area) for more than 100 years. Tension began to flare in Nagpur. It was even asserted that Nagpur should be made capital of new state of Maharashtra. Further the memorandum submitted by M.S.Aney and Biyani was rejected. Leaders of Maharashtra met these fears half-way, by ensuring the maintenance of bench of High Court and a session of Legislature at Nagpur. The informal pact between political leaders before 1960 thus made Nagpur the second capital of Maharashtra. Page 35. The Pact assured equitable development of all the regions of the proposed Marathi State.

The life of Mr. Thomas Firmin, late citizen of London written by one of his most intimate acquaintances. London 1698Joseph Cornish The life of Mr. Thomas Firmin, citizen of London Devon 1780 Early life Firmin was born to Puritan parents, Henry and Prudence Firmin in Ipswich. Henry Firmin was a parishioner of Samuel Ward, the Puritan incumbent of St. Mary-le-Tower, by whom in 1635 he was accused of erroneous tenets. Thomas Firmin as a young man sent to London and apprenticed to a girdler and mercer who attended the services of John Goodwin at St Stephen Coleman Street; he took down Goodwin's sermons in shorthand. Setting up in business on his own, in Lombard Street, he met generally latitudinarian Anglicans (Whichcote, John Worthington, John Wilkins, Edward Fowler, and Edward Tillotson). He also became acquainted with John Biddle, who would become an important practical influence. He married in 1660. Philanthropy and the linen workhouse Firmin's first philanthropic experiment was occasioned by the trade disorganisation in 1665, the year of the Great Plague. He provided employment at making up clothing for hands thrown out of work. During the Great Fire of London (1666) his Lombard Street premises were burned. He secured temporary accommodation in Leadenhall Street, and in a few years was able to rebuild in Lombard Street, and to carry on his business with increased success. In 1676 he left the management of the concern in the hands of his nephew and partner, Jonathan James (son of his sister Prudence), who had been his apprentice; he was then worth about ¬£9,000. Since about 1673 he had been a governor of Christ's Hospital. Early in 1676 he started a workhouse in Little Britain, for the employment of the poor in the linen manufacture;‚Äô he built new premises expressly for it. Tillotson suggests that Firmin was influenced by the example of Thomas Gouge. Firmin employed as many as seventeen hundred spinners, besides flax-dressers, weavers, at the market rate (a sixteen-hour day for 6d.), but with some bonuses in kind. He made arrangements for the comfort and cleanliness of his hands, and for the training of children from the streets. He printed large editions of a Scripture Catechism (probably by Edward Fowler), and gave rewards to those who learned it. The scheme never paid its way, and he had to carry the losses. In 1690 the patentees of the linen manufacture took it over, retaining Firmin as its manager on a salary, and reducing the wages. The new arrangement was still unsuccessful, Firmin was not paid, and the enterprise was returned to him. He kept it up to the day of his death, and nominally contrived to make it pay, by keeping the wages low, and supplementing them by private doles to his workers. The higher rate of wages in woollen manufacture led Firmin to attempt its introduction as a London industry, in Artillery Lane. After losing money on the pilot scheme for over two years he abandoned it. He was also involved in collecting for Huguenot refugees, and started a linen manufacture for them in Ipswich in 1682. From about 1676 he interested himself in the condition of prisoners for debt, freeing several hundreds who were detained for small sums, and successfully promoting acts of grace for the liberation of others. He visited prisons, inquired into the treatment pursued, and prosecuted harsh and extortionate gaolers. In conjunction with his friend, Sir Robert Clayton, Firmin was an active governor of Christ's Hospital, carrying out improvements, of structure and arrangement. On Sunday evenings it was his custom to attend the scholars' service, and see that their ‚Äòpudding-pies‚Äô for supper were of proper ‚Äòbigness.‚Äô In April 1693 he was elected a governor of St. Thomas's Hospital, of which Clayton had been made president in the previous year. Firmin carried through the work of rebuilding the hospital and church. He kept a register of the poor he visited, recommending their cases, and apprenticing their children. From Biddle that he learned to make it his business to look into the condition of the poor by personal investigation, and to reduce the causes of social distress. Religious and political views In 1662 he raised money partly by ‚Äòcollections in churches‚Äô for the exiled anti-trinitarians of Poland; but when the Polish Calvinists met the same fate Firmin joined efforts for their relief. His acquaintance with religious controversies was gained in conversation, with most leading churchmen. He also shared Biddle's views in the matter of religious toleration, and his views on Catholicism turned on religious persecution. In politics Firmin does not seem to have taken any part till 1685. His opposition to James II cost him for a time his governorship at Christ's Hospital. Not won by James's declaration for liberty of conscience, he aided the circulation of pamphlets which sounded the alarm against it. His principles seem to have been republican, but he was a devoted adherent to William of Orange. To Robert Frampton, the nonjuring bishop of Gloucester, Firmin remarked, ‚ÄòI hope you will not be a nonconformist in your old age.‚Äô Frampton retorted that Firmin himself was ‚Äòa nonconformist to all Christendom besides a few lowsy sectarys in Poland.‚Äô On the Protestant exodus from Ireland in 1688‚Äì9 Firmin was the principal commissioner for the relief of the refugees; more than ¬£56,000 went through his hands, and eight of the Protestant hierarchy of Ireland addressed to him a joint letter of thanks. He was rendering a similar service for the nonjurors in 1695, when he was stopped by the interference of the government. Firmin was an original member of the Society for the Reformation of Manners (1691), and was very active in the enforcement of fines for the repression of profane swearing. Luke Milbourn in 1692 speaks of Firmin as a ‚Äòhawker‚Äô for the Socinians, ‚Äòto disperse their new- fangled divinity.‚Äô Books of this class known with certainty to have been promoted by him include the following: * In 1687 there was printed at his expense ‚ÄòA Brief History of the Unitarians, called also Socinians.‚Äô It is in the shape of four letters, written for his information, probably by Stephen Nye, and is noteworthy as marking the first appearance in English literature of the term ‚Äòunitarian,‚Äô a name unknown to Biddle. * In 1689 he printed ‚ÄòBrief Notes on the Creed of St. Athanasius,‚Äô a sheet by an unknown author. *John Tillotson Archbishop of Canterbury and a friend of Firmin, who had lectured on the Socinian controversy at St. Lawrence, Jewry, in 1679‚Äì80, felt himself compelled by ‚Äòcalumnies‚Äô to publish the lectures in 1693. He sent a copy to Firmin, who printed a letter (29 September 1694) in reply, probably by Nye, under the title ‚ÄòConsiderations on the Explications of the Doctrine of the Trinity‚Äô (sometimes confounded with a tract of 1693 with similar title, and by the same hand). This he laid before Tillotson, who remarked that Gilbert Burnet's forthcoming exposition of the articles ‚Äòshall humble your writers.‚Äô *In 1697, at Firmin's instance, appeared ‚ÄòThe Agreement of the Unitarians with the Catholick Church,‚Äô a work which more closely expresses his own views than any of the foregoing. He never departed from the communion of the church of England, but put a Sabellian sense on the public forms. At the time of his death he was meditating a plan of ‚Äòunitarian congregations‚Äô to meet for devotional purposes as fraternities within the church. Last days Firmin became consumptive, and was carried off in a couple of days by a typhoid fever, dying on 20 December 1697. Bishop Fowler attended him on his deathbed. He was buried in the cloisters at Christ's Hospital, where a marble slab was placed in his memory. A memorial pillar stands in the grounds of Marden Park, Surrey. He died worth about ¬£3,000. Publications *Some Proposals for the Imploying of the Poor, especially in and about London, and for the Prevention of Begging. In a Letter to a Friend. By T. F., 1678. An enlarged issue appeared in 1681; two editions same year. It was reprinted in a collection of ‚ÄòTracts relating to the Poor,‚Äô 1787. *The Faith of One God (1691) - a collection of tracts about the Trinity published by Firmin as part of the \\"Socinian controversy\\" among Anglicans from about 1687-98. The first part is largely writings by John Biddle (1615‚Äì62), the first prominent English unitarian. The second contains seven anonymous works, some by Stephen Nye (1648‚Äì1719). Family He was twice married: first, in 1660, to a citizen's daughter with a portion of ¬£500; she died while Firmin was at Cambridge on business, leaving a son (d. about 1690) and a daughter (d. in infancy); secondly, in 1664, to Margaret (d. 14 January 1719, aged 77), daughter of Giles Dentt, J.P., of Newport, Essex, alderman of London; by her he had several children, who all died in infancy, except the eldest, Giles, born 22 May 1665 (Tillotson was his godfather). Giles received his mother's portion and became a merchant; he married Rachel (d. 11 April 1724), daughter of Perient Trott and sister of Lady Clayton; died at Oporto on 22 January 1694, and was buried at Newport on 13 April; his widow afterwards married Owen Griffith, rector of Blechingley, Surrey.
