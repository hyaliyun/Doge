James was born in Henry County, Georgia, where he farmed until moving to Atlanta in 1850 to clerk for $10 a month and after three years was making $700 a year.Atlanta Journal, June 16, 1883 After that he went into sales, running auctions of books, jewelry and other valuables throughout the Southern states. During the American Civil War he and his wife travelled to Canada and Nassau, Bahamas, and afterwards they returned to Atlanta where he founded the James Bank. In 1869, he purchased a large city lot that stretched from Peachtree to Spring Street along Cain (today's International Blvd) and built a large mansion. Within a year it was purchased by the state of Georgia to become the Governor's mansion for which purpose it survived until 1923.Garrett, vol II, p. 213 He made over $30,000 on the deal and immediately built his next home on the south end of that same block (where the old Macy's building stands today). He won nearly 100% of the December 1871 mayoral election as a Democrat which put an end to the brief surge of Radical Republican power in the city. He sold his home at Ellis and Peachtree in 1883 to the Capital City Club who used it until their new building on Harris was completed in 1913.

Taranto became the capital of the principality, which covered almost all of the heel of Apulia. During its subsequent 377 years of history, it was sometimes a powerful and almost independent feudal fief of the Kingdom of Sicily (and later of Naples), sometimes only a title, often given to the heir to the crown or to the husband of a reigning queen. When the House of Anjou was divided, Taranto fell to the house of Durazzo (1394-1463). Ferdinand I of Naples united the Principality of Taranto to the Kingdom of Naples at the death of his wife, Isabella of Clermont.

It was probably created as a simple circlet of four curved rectangular jewelled plates for Charles the Bald, the grandson of Charlemagne, but later, four large jewelled fleur-de-lis were added to these four original plates, probably by Philip Augustus around 1180 and surmounted by a cap decorated with precious stones. At this time a similar but open crown, the one of the queen, existed too. One of them was melted down in 1590 by the Catholic League during the siege of Paris.

The opening has several measures of orchestral music before the solo cello enters with an ad lib theme that is played three times. This leads into the fast section, which features many fast and aggressive arpeggios, and quick and relentless sixteenth notes. The second movement starts with a slow andantino section, then progresses into a lively allegro presto. The music returns to the andantino tempo. Before the end of the second movement, the allegro presto returns. The solo cello ends on pizzicato chords with the orchestra. The solo cello opens with a slow andante in the third movement; the orchestra joins in and then takes over. The music becomes a lively rondo marked allegro vivace, the cello solo returning with a forceful entry into the rondo theme. The main theme is based on the D major scale and a quick fall down.

Formerly the GAFE (Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales  Special-Forces Airmobile Group), the SF Corps has six battalions; one is the Fuerza especial de reaccion, a quick-response unit, and one is assigned to the Paratroopers Rifle Brigade; the motto of the SF Corps is Todo por México (Everything for Mexico). Within the SF Corps, there are regular, intermediate, and veteran -service troops. The regular-service soldiers usually operate as light infantry. The intermediate-service soldiers (lieutenants and captains) usually are instructors. The veteran-service soldiers of the Fuerzas Especiales del Alto Mando (FEs High Command) handle Black-Ops missions. Also known as the COIFE, the Special Forces Corps of the Mexican Army is equivalent to the U.S. Army Special Forces. History Official Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales green beret GAFE was created in 1986 as the \\"Fuerza de Intervención Rápida\\" (Rapid Intervention Force) to provide security for the FIFA World Cup soccer games in Mexico City. France's GIGN trained the group in special weapons and counter-terrorism tactics. On June 1, 1990 the group adopted its most known name, GAFE, becoming a Corps (with division-sized formation) in 2013 as part of the expansion of the Army. It again changed its name from GAFE to Special Forces Corps in 2004. Eight years later (in 1994) the GAFEs saw action fighting EZLN guerrillas in Chiapas. There is scant public information about the operations in which they participated during that conflict. During the 1990s, the GAFE reportedly received training in commando and urban warfare from Israeli special forces and American Special Forces units, which included training in rapid deployment, marksmanship, ambushes, counter-surveillance and the art of intimidation.Grayson, George W. (2012). The Executioner's Men: Los Zetas, Rogue Soldiers, Criminal Entrepreneurs, and the Shadow State They Created (1st ed.), page 46, Transaction Publishers. It is also known that at some point several members were trained in the infamous US Army School of the Americas, in enhanced interrogation techniques and psychological warfare (Psy-Ops). Nowadays the army special forces continue fighting the war against drug cartels in Mexico. They have successfully captured many big drug leaders such as Benjamin Arellano Felix of the Tijuana Cartel, Carlos Rosales Mendoza of La Familia Cartel and Osiel Cardenas Guillen of the Gulf Cartel. =Controversies= In 1994 the EZLN guerrilla seized several towns across the southern state of Chiapas. The Mexican government sent in \\"GAFEs\\" to put down the insurgents. Within hours, 30 rebels were killed and others were captured. Later their bodies were disposed on a riverbank – with their ears and noses sliced off. In 1999, about 34 GAFE defectors were recruited to join the Gulf Cartel, serving as the cartel's armed wing - which became known as Los Zetas. This group also recruited national and foreign military personnel (like U.S. Army soldiers and Guatemalan Kaibiles), corrupt police officers and street gang members, and used their knowledge of torture and psychological warfare to terrorize their rivals and innocent civilians alike. By 2011 only 10 of the original 34 zetas remained fugitives. Most of them have been killed or captured by Mexican Army, Federal Police and the Special Forces Corps. It is alleged that on October 2, 2013 during a demonstration by so-called \\"anarchist youth groups\\" to protest against the Mexican President and to commemorate the 1968 tlatelolco student massacre, undercover GAFEs worked as agent provocateurs to disrupt the march and cause the riot police to crush it. Training Since its creation they have received a wide variety of training from different special forces groups from around the world (including the French GIGN, Israeli Sayeret and American Green Berets). The Army unified all the knowledge by creating in 1998 the Escuela Militar de Fuerzas Especiales (En. Special Forces Military School).

At that time, she encountered Wolverine in a private moment, which developed into a mutual attraction.Uncanny X-Men #118 Afterward, Mariko would frequently visit the United States to see Wolverine.Uncanny X-Men #143 Some time later, however, Mariko was married by Shingen to Yakuza gang leader Noburu-Hideki to solidify her father's connections to the Japanese underworld, and was subjected to brutal domestic abuse by her husband. She was later used by him to maneuver Wolverine into participating in an assassination of a rival by having the superhero inadvertently provide a distraction while protecting his true love/girlfriend from the rival's own assassins. This also had the intended effect of deepening Mariko's disgust for Logan upon witnessing Logan going berserk in battle. However, Mariko soon realized that her father was evil and was shaming her family with sinister schemes. To stop Shingen, Mariko planned to kill her father and then commit seppuku in recompense, but Logan, learning the truth about this manipulation and inspired by a personal epiphany about humanity, attacked and slew her father in a fair battle of honor before she could act. In doing so, Logan was convinced that Mariko would be honorbound to kill him for that and was prepared to die at her hands rather than harm her in self-defense. However, Mariko explained her opinion of her father and presented the family katana to Logan as a token of her approval as an honorable warrior who is properly entitled to it.Wolverine (1982 miniseries) #1-4 Upon her father's death, she became head (Oyabun) of the Yakuza crime family Clan Yashida. Mariko happily became Logan's fiancée, but their wedding was halted by the supervillain Mastermind who used a mind control device to change Mariko's mind.Uncanny X-Men #173 When the control was lifted, Wolverine and Mariko resumed their romantic relationship after a period of separation, but have not reconsidered marriage. Mariko also refused any closer engagement with Logan until she had dealt with her father's criminal legacy, which she felt honor-bound to rectify. The X-Men returned from the first Secret Wars and, accidentally ending up in Japan, fighting a dragon their companion Lockheed had brought along. During the chaos, the young girl Amiko Kobayashi loses her mother when a collapsing building crushes her. Dying, the woman begs Wolverine to take care of her daughter.Uncanny X-Men #181 (May 1984) Since Wolverine could not take care of the girl himself, Wolverine chose to place Amiko in Mariko's care, whom the girl soon adopted as a surrogate mother. Amiko and Mariko were at one point targeted by Ogun (one of Wolverine's old enemies) but the attack was averted by Wolverine and Kitty Pryde. Mariko was poisoned with tetrodotoxin from a blowfish by the assassin Reiko in the employ of her rival Matsu'o Tsurayaba.Wolverine Vol. 2 #57 (July 1992) She asked Wolverine to kill her to avoid a painful death and preserve her honor. Wolverine killed her and vowed to avenge Mariko by yearly severing parts of Matsu'o's body on the anniversary of her death. Phaedra, an agent of the Hand, resurrected Shingen and stole a piece of Wolverine's soul to torture. Wolverine made a deal with Azrael (the Angel of Death) to kill Phaedra to stop resurrecting the dead if Azrael would heal Wolverine's soul. Phaedra attempted to convince Wolverine to spare her by offering to resurrect Mariko, but Wolverine refused. Wolverine stated that he would pay any price to bring Mariko back, but Logan deeply loved Mariko because she was a better person than himself in every way, and he knew that Mariko would never accept life if it meant that someone as evil as Phaedra was allowed to live as well.Wolverine Vol. 3 #61 Many years later, Wolverine was captured by the Devil and taken to Hell. In order to have Wolverine comply with his demands, the lord of Hell had Mariko's soul (who had been condemned to Hell for her leadership of the Yashida clan's criminal activities) brought to torture Wolverine into submission; Wolverine, however, was eventually rescued by Puck and Thomas Logan.Wolverine Vol. 4 #2 When Logan finally prepared to flee Hell, Logan intended to take Mariko alongside but (feeling remorse) she asked to be left behind and return to Earth and reclaim his own life, a request Logan reluctantly acquiesced to.Wolverine Vol. 4 #4 Old Man Logan faced off against the Hand during their Regenix operation, facing their latest member called the Scarlet Samurai. Logan later discovered that Scarlet Samurai is Mariko resurrected by the Hand to serve as their weapon. With help from Logan, nanites were used to free Mariko from the Hand's control while Gorgon got away.Old Man Logan Vol. 2 #31-33. Marvel Comics. When Logan prepared to return to his own time, he asked Mariko to keep an eye on the young girl would have been in his wife in his own timeline, feeling that asking the other X-Men to keep an eye on her would have risked bringing her too close to his own life whereas Mariko understood the consequences of loving Logan and would be able to keep the girl safe while keeping her distant.Dead Man Logan #6 Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" timeline, Mariko Yashida was a member of the Human High Council, a group of humans that opposed Apocalypse's tyrannical rule. While not engaged to Logan, Mariko was his former lover and she birthed a daughter, Kirika, an amalgam of X-23 and Amiko Kobayashi. Mariko participates in an attempt to bomb forces of Apocalypse based in North America, though she knows this would mean extensive civilian deaths. =Exiles= thumb In an alternate universe (Earth-2109), Mariko Yashida was Sunfire and a member of the Exiles from Exiles #2 (September, 2001) until her death in Exiles #37 (January, 2004) of their ongoing series. In the 2109 alternate universe, she had the same powers as her 616 Marvel Universe counterpart Sunfire and Sunpyre. This version was created by Judd Winick and Mike McKone. A Japanese citizen and a member of the X-Men in her reality, she was one of Marvel's few openly homosexual characters. She has a relationship with one reality's version of Spider-Woman (Mary Jane Watson). Reception Sunfire's open homosexuality has attracted some interest after coming out in Exiles #11.Gay League profile Her death has also garnered some attention. Perry Moore includes her as an example of the poor treatment of gay superheroes, paralleling the earlier Women in Refrigerators.Perry Moore (2007) Hero (432 pages, Hyperion, ) extract : \\"Who Cares About the Death of a Gay Superhero Anyway?\\" Judd Winick has been accused of pursuing some broader social agenda, making Sunfire gay being one of his ideas used to support this notion, as he explains in an interview with Comic Book Resources:Winick on \\"Green Arrow\\", Mia's HIV Status and More, Comic Book Resources, October 14, 2004 =What If?= In the What If story \\"If Wolverine Had Married Mariko\\", their marriage is not hindered by Mastermind, and Wolverine becomes head of the Shingen clan. However, they soon have to contend with the Yakuza, all united by the Kingpin. Although they appear to prevail with the aid of the Silver Samurai and Sunfire, Mariko is eventually assassinated by the Silver Samurai himself, who had turned traitor, leaving Wolverine to return to the X-Men.What If? vol. 2 #43 (1992) =Wolverine Noir= Mariko Yashida appears in Wolverine Noir as a businesswoman looking to expand her father's interests into New York City.\\"Wolverine Noir\\" 2009 =Wolverine MAX= Mariko Yashida appears in Wolverine MAX as a member of the Yashida clan during the early 1900s. She met and fell in love with Logan, but their relationship ended after he killed her father.Wolverine MAX #4 In the present, Logan is shown in a relationship with a woman named Yami Yashida, until she is killed in a plane crash.Wolverine MAX #1 She is also much older in this continuity having been born in the 1860s but died sometime in the 1910s. In other media =Television= * Mariko Yashida appears in the Wolverine and the X-Men animated series, voiced by Gwendoline Yeo. This depiction is Wolverine's former sweetheart/lover and Kenuichio Harada's reluctant wife. She strongly fell romantically in love with Logan, despite her father wanting her to marry Harada due to Yakuza connections. In the episode \\"Code of Conduct\\", Mariko is at the Japanese Embassy looking for her power-hungry husband when Silver Samurai had abducted the X-Men. She's present at the recent duel between Logan and Silver Samurai. After Harada acted dishonorably (using mutant abilities when not allowed) which annulled the duel and was taken away for dishonoring the Yakuza clan who agreed to release the X-Men, Mariko told Logan that her husband will be driven from the Yakuza in shame and will not be admitted again. When she's asked why she had chose Harada over Logan, she said that her father and the Yakuza would have killed them both had she not chosen Harada, awaiting her decision with drawn swords. She said that marrying Harada was the only honorable thing she could do, even if it meant keeping her and Logan forever apart from one another. Mariko and Logan then went their separate ways. * Mariko Yashida appears in twelve-episode miniseries Marvel Anime: Wolverine, voiced by Fumiko Orikasa in the Japanese dub and reprised by Gwendoline Yeo in the English dub. This version is arranged by Shingen Yashida to be married to Hideki Kurohagi (the current leader of Madripoor). Logan spends the entire series on a quest to free her from this engagement so they can be together again. In the twelfth and last episode, Mariko is accidentally shot in the chest by Hideki but not before confessing the strong and enduring romantic feelings she has always had for Logan, assuring Logan that she will always be together in spirit as she peacefully dies in his arms. =Film= Mariko Yashida appears as a major character in the 2013 film The Wolverine, in which she is portrayed by Tao Okamoto. In this version, she's Ichirō Yashida's granddaughter, Shingen Yashida's daughter, Yukio's foster sister and Wolverine's love interest. At her grandfather's funeral, she gets kidnapped by the Yakuza crime syndicate but saved by Logan. As they hide in Yashida's house, they start to fall for each other. Mariko is kidnapped and taken to Yashida Corporation's headquarters where it's revealed that her father was the one who ordered the Yakuza to kidnap and ultimately assassinate her because Ichirō had left the family empire to her instead of Shingen. She is saved by Kenuichio Harada with the Black Ninja clan and taken to a research center based where Ichirō was born. When it's revealed that Ichirō's alive and used Mariko as bait to capture and extract Wolverine's immortality using a robotic adamantium armor, she manages to free Wolverine by directing the machine Wolverine is in into the sword strike, breaking her grandfather's focus and freeing Wolverine. Mariko also hits Ichirō with Wolverine's discarded claws, allowing Wolverine to finish her grandfather off. Later Mariko is Yashida Corporation's new CEO and says goodbye to Logan, hoping to see Logan again.

It is in the metropolitan area of London and the Greater London Urban Area. Three of the twelve tall ornate stone monuments named Eleanor crosses (carved and put up within about three years of the death of Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I) are intact, one here, one at Geddington and one at Hardingstone. The town takes its name from its Eleanor cross, situated in the town centre. The town has a modest commercial centre, and is immediately north of the M25 motorway. Waltham Cross takes up a south-eastern corner of its county. The Waltham Cross post town stretches to the neighbouring town of Cheshunt and a small part of Enfield. Geography The town falls within Hertfordshire's Borough of Broxbourne, the metropolitan area of London, and the Greater London Urban Area, with Waltham Abbey to the east, Cheshunt to the north, and Enfield to the south. The M25 motorway runs immediately south of the town, bordering the area of Freezywater. The Waltham Cross post town includes the neighbouring town of Cheshunt, some northern sections of Enfield, including the Holmesdale Estate. Waltham Cross occupies a south-eastern far corner of Hertfordshire so bordering Essex, and its former parent Urban District was dissolved into its present local government unit, the Borough of Broxbourne in 1974. History Waltham Cross was, for centuries from the building of its cross in the 1290s, a smaller locality in the ancient parish of Cheshunt in the Hertford hundred of Hertfordshire.'The hundred of Hertford: Introduction and map', in A History of the County of Hertford: Vol. 3, ed.

The southern part of Cheshunt became increasingly to be considered Waltham Cross, which was formed into a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1855, with its church of Holy Trinity (since renamed Christ Church) built in 1832 and designed by the architect Edward Blore. The road, here long called the High Street, had 'Spital Houses' (Hospitalry Houses) near the county boundary, originally built in 1625 but rebuilt in 1908. In the early 20th century, all along the 2¼ miles of the road which Cheshunt and Waltham Cross covered, there were numerous inns and taverns, one or two of which, such as the Four Swans Inn, plied for trade until at least that date from the 17th century, but most of them dated from the 18th century and later.'Parishes: Cheshunt', in A History of the County of Hertford: Volume 3, ed.

In April 1974 the town, together with Cheshunt and the Hoddesdon urban district councils, merged to form the Borough of Broxbourne.Local history Retrieved 2 September 2010 The town takes its name from the Eleanor Cross which stands in its centre.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=21129 Landmarks = The Eleanor Cross = At the centre of the town is one of the three surviving medieval Eleanor crosses, memorials completed before the end of 1294 commemorating the over-night resting places of the coffin of Eleanor of Castile, wife of King Edward I, on its processional journey from Lincoln to Westminster Abbey in 1290. It was the only one designed by a foreigner, in name at least, Nicholas Dymenge de Reyns or de Legeri. Records, some patched together and non-contemporary, state her body, deceased on 28 November rested at St Albans on the night of 12 December and was carried to \\"Waltham\\" on the following day, where it rested for the night at Waltham Abbey and arrived in London on 14 December. A recreation of a fourth such cross, the most southerly, destroyed in the English Civil War is at Charing Cross station less than a mile from the abbey in London. In the early 18th century the monument was surveyed by the Society of Antiquaries of London who, advocating its conservation, printed and illustrated the results in the pages of Vetusta Monumenta in 1721. However, restoration did not take place until 1832, when extensive rebuilding was carried out under William Barnard Clarke. A further major restoration was carried out in 1885–92, and yet another in 1950–53.HeritageGateway.org.uk The cross is hexagonal in plan, in three stages. The main stage has three statues of the Queen, each standing in a niche under a canopy, while the other three faces have a niche bisected by a buttress. The original sculptures were by Alexander of Abingdon. These have been replaced in the course of restoration, but one of the originals can be seen on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum.http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1265_frost/?m=200611Lysons, Daniel, The Environs of London: Counties of Herts, Essex & Kent, 1796, p.50 = Four Swannes sign = The Four Swans sign in 2009 The High Street is spanned by a gantry sign supporting four sculpted swans.

The premiere took place on 25 October 1923 at Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris.  Background  It was in London in 1920 that Milhaud discovered jazz.1001 Classical Recordings You Must Hear Before You Die, Matthew RyeOn a trip to the United States in 1922, Darius Milhaud heard \\"authentic\\" jazz on the streets of Harlem, \\"Milhaud – La création du monde\\" (of Darius Milhaud, English language), Pomona College, Department of Music, 1999, webpage (archive from 7 April 2015): . which left a great impact on his musical outlook. It was like nothing he had heard before. He wrote \\"against the beat of the drums, the melodic lines crisscrossed in a breathless pattern of broken and twisted rhythms.\\"1001 Classical Recordings You Must Hear Before You Die, Matthew Rye Using jazz elements, the following year he finished composing La Création du monde, which was cast as a ballet in six continuous parts. The work was commissioned by the Ballets suédois, a ballet company which was contemporary to Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. The company was very influential in the early 1920s, staging five seasons in Paris and touring continually. The ballet reflects both the ideal of the aesthetic of Les six to combine popular forms of art and a centuries-old French penchant for exotica. Milhaud was very susceptible to all kinds of influences, but it was a different type of exotica that drew him. He was in the Paris of Le jazz hot, singer Josephine Baker, Pablo Picasso's paintings, and the sculptures inspired by African masks. During the early '20s, African (and Afro-American) fashion was sweeping Paris, and this ballet may have been Ballets suédois' attempt to follow the trend. Les Six frequently socialized at the Gaya Bar, where Milhaud liked to hear Jean Wiener play “negro music” in a popular style. During the jazz age in Paris this music was often labeled “le tumult noir (the black noise).”https://www.indianapolissymphony.org/about/archive/program- notes/darius-milhaud/la-creation-du-monde When Milhaud first heard an American jazz band in London (1920), he was reportedly so captivated that he took off to New York City to spend time in clubs and bars, visit Harlem and mingle with jazz musicians. After returning to France, Milhaud began to write in what he called a jazz idiom. He chose to color his music with bluesy turns of harmony and melody, swinging climaxes, and stomping rhythms. Jazz influences appear in many of his compositions, but this ballet was the first opportunity to express his new passion; even the instrumental grouping draws on his memories of New York City. \\"In some of the shows,\\" Milhaud noted, \\"the singers were accompanied by flute, clarinet, trumpets, trombone, a complicated percussion section played by just one man, piano and string quartet.\\" Leonard Bernstein summarized the piece best: “The Creation of the World emerges not as a flirtation but as a real love affair with jazz.” https://www.indianapolissymphony.org/about/archive/program-notes/darius- milhaud/la-creation-du-monde  Reception  At the time, La Création du monde was more a succès de scandale than a true success. The ballet costumes designed by Fernand Léger (who also created the stage sets) worked well visually, but were difficult to dance in; the costumes were heavy and too inflexible to allow the dancers to move freely. The costumes and sets from the original performance of La Création du monde still survive in museums and galleries, while the music has taken its place in the concert repertoire. The choreography is revived occasionally out of curiosity.  Instrumentation  The score is written for a small orchestra of eighteen instrumentalists: 2 flutes, (1 also plays piccolo), oboe, 2 clarinets, bassoon, alto saxophone, french horn, 2 trumpets, trombone, piano, 3 timpani + 2 small timpani, 1 percussionist (snare drum, tenor drum, tambourin, pedal bass drum + cymbal attachment, cymbals, tambourine, wood-block and cowbell), 2 violins, violoncello, double bass. The alto saxophone part appears in the score where a viola part would generally be. Milhaud also made a version for piano and string quartet (Op. 81b). \\"Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra\\" (program notes), Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, 1999, TheSPCO.org webpage: SPCO-98 Del Mar, Norman.

Calhoun (February 12, 1811October 1, 1875) was an American politician who served as the sixteenth mayor of Atlanta, Georgia during the American Civil War, best known as the recipient of Union General William T. Sherman's famous \\"war is cruelty\\" (often misquoted as \\"war is hell\\") letter. Early life and education Calhoun was born in South Carolina; his father was a cousin of Democrat John C. Calhoun. After the death of his parents when he was 18, he moved to Decatur, Georgia to live with his older brother Ezkiel N. Calhoun who was a lawyer. He began studying law in 1831 and passed the bar February 22, 1832. Politically, Calhoun was a Whig in a largely Democratic district but was still elected to the Georgia General Assembly in 1837 from DeKalb County, and to the State Senate in 1851. Career =Mayor of Atlanta= In 1852, Calhoun moved to Atlanta, where ten years later he served four one-year terms as its mayor. In 1863, he commissioned a volunteer militia to defend his city. When Union troops under the command of William T. Sherman drew near during the Atlanta campaign, much of the population of Atlanta, including Calhoun's wife and children, fled the city. This reduced the population of Atlanta from around 22,000 to less than 3,000 when the Confederate Army of Tennessee retreated from the city on September 1, 1864. Calhoun surrendered the city to Union forces under Sherman on September 2, 1864, writing, \\"Sir: The fortune of war has placed Atlanta in your hands. As mayor of the city I ask protection of non-combatants and private property.\\" A marker now stands at the corner of Peachtree Street and Alabama Street indicating where the surrender took place. Sherman replied by ordering the evacuation of the remaining civilian population of Atlanta on September 7, 1864. Calhoun and the city council protested this order, claiming that most of those who had not fled could not leave on account of their age, sickness, pregnancy, or destitution. In response, Sherman wrote back, accusing the Confederates of hypocrisy for invading Union territory and inflicting pains on American citizens, but only complaining when the reverse was done to them: Union soldiers under Sherman occupied the city for two months and burned much of it on November 15, 1864, in preparation for the March to the Sea. Burial place Calhoun is buried in Oakland Cemetery. His son, William Lowndes Calhoun, served as Atlanta's mayor in the 1870s.

He is best remembered for his work on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, and for once mispronouncing President Herbert Hoover's name on the air, a slip that was exaggerated on a later comedy record album. Life and career =Early years= Harry von Zell was born July 11, 1906, in Indianapolis, Indiana, the first of Iva Clara (née Gohn) (1889-1932) and Harry Adolph (1887-1963) Von Zell's two children. Von Zell's father was a sports reporter for the Indianapolis Star. The family moved to Sioux City, Iowa, where von Zell graduated from high school. Later, the family moved to California, where he studied music and drama at the University of California, Los Angeles, and worked at a variety of jobs. After friends tricked him into singing on a radio program, he began receiving offers from radio stations, and his career in that medium began. =Announcing= Von Zell broke into show business as a singer and announcer at radio station KMIC in Inglewood, California, in the mid-1920s. In late 1926, von Zell sang on the \\"Times de Luxe Program\\" on KHJ in Los AngelesLos Angeles Times, Nov. 9, Nov. 16, 1926, and was eventually employed as the manager of KMTR Los Angeles,Variety, June 25, 1930, moving to KGB San Diego in January 1929.Los Angeles Times, Jan. 20, 1929 Auditioning for Paul Whiteman's radio show later that year, he was chosen from a field of 250 announcers. When that series came to an end in 1930, he headed for New York and became a CBS staff announcer, working with Fred Allen, Phil Baker, Eddy Duchin and Ed Wynn. He also announced for The Aldrich Family, The Amazing Mr. Smith,Dunning, John. (1998). On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio. Oxford University Press. . P. 21, 24. and The March of Time. During the 1920s and 1930s, von Zell served as announcer on some 20 shows a week. His longest- running radio partnership was his nine seasons with veteran comedian Eddie Cantor. From October, 1940 to June, 1949 von Zell served as Cantor's commercial spokesperson and straight man. Then, as Cantor cast member Dinah Shore's solo career began to blossom, she brought von Zell in as announcer on her Birds Eye Open House program. As a young announcer, von Zell made a memorable verbal slip in 1931 when he referred to U.S. President Herbert Hoover as \\"Hoobert Heever\\" during a live tribute on Hoover's birthday. Hoover was not present at this tribute. Von Zell's blooper came at the end of a lengthy summation of Hoover's career, during which von Zell had pronounced the President's name correctly several times. Some mistakenly believe Hoover was present when the incident occurred, because of a re-enactment fabricated by Kermit Schaefer for his Pardon My Blooper record album, a number of years later. =Music= Von Zell was the vocalist for the first recording session of Charlie Barnet's musical career. A session on October 9, 1933 has von Zell singing, \\"I Want You, I Need You\\" (which was remade on October 25, 1933), as well as \\"What Is Sweeter (Than the Sweetness of 'I Love You')?\\". In 1941 von Zell sang on NBC's popular \\"jam session\\" program The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street. He and three other staff announcers became an impromptu barbershop quartet, with von Zell offering commentary in a florid, Victorian style. =Radio comedy= As an actor, von Zell appeared on the Joan Davis radio series as the love interest of the character played by Verna Felton. When he entered a room, Felton would often shout excitedly, \\"Why, Mr. von Zellllllllllll!\\" After this, von Zell headlined his own short-lived radio program, The Smiths of Hollywood, which featured Arthur Treacher and Jan Ford (who would later become Howard Hughes' paramour under the name Terry Moore). =Film= As a film actor, von Zell appeared in at least 28 features and in his own series of slapstick comedy shorts for Columbia Pictures (1946–50). His film debut came in 1943, when he provided the offscreen narration for four entries in the Flicker Flashbacks series of silent-film satires. His face was first seen on screen in feature films of 1945. His movies included The Saxon Charm, Dear Wife, Son of Paleface, Two Flags West, USS Teakettle, and For Heaven's Sake. =Television= Von Zell worked in the early days of television, in 1931 describing boxing matches on experimental television boxing broadcasts.Radio Dial Log in The New York Sun dated August 20, 1931 Nearly 20 years later, the exposure von Zell received from the Columbia comedies led to his being hired for television shows as the medium began to reach a mass audience. In early 1950, he had his first major television exposure as announcer and spokesman for Pabst Blue Ribbon beer on Jackie Gleason's The Life of Riley. In September 1951, at the beginning of the second television season of The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, he replaced the first season's announcer Bill Goodwin, who had also announced for the Burns & Allen radio show for many years. Appearing under his own name (as Goodwin had), Harry von Zell continued to play the befuddled friend of the Burns family, and the show-within-a-show's announcer, until 1958, the year of Gracie Allen's retirement and the series' conclusion. During the 1958-59 television season, von Zell continued working with George Burns on his short-lived 25-week NBC sitcom, The George Burns Show. That same year he wrote the teleplays for four episodes of NBC's Wagon Train, appearing in one of them. In 1959 he joined comedian George Gobel, announcing for his single-season half- hour program on CBS. During 1960 and 1961 von Zell appeared in five episodes of the television series Bachelor Father as Frank Curtis, a good friend of Bentley Gregg (played by John Forsythe). Von Zell appeared in the Perry Mason episodes \\"The Case of the Ancient Romeo\\" (1962), and as the murderer Sidney Hawes in \\"The Case of the Libelous Locket\\" (1963). He was also cast in an episode of NBC's western series, The Tall Man, and appeared in an episode of McHale's Navy as Admiral Parker, the uncle of Tim Conway's character Ensign Parker. Last appearance was on an episode of Ellery Queen in 1975. Von Zell delivered the commentary on Celebrity Golf, a series of half-hour, nine-hole golf matches made in 1960 with Sam Snead taking on such Hollywood celebrities as Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope at Los Angeles golf courses such as Woodland Hills and Lakeside Country Club. Those matches were rerun in recent years on the Golf Channel. In his later years von Zell was a commercial spokesman for Los Angeles-based savings and loan association Home Savings of America. In 1976 he was one of the many leading radio announcers who participated in a television special, The Good Old Days of Radio. Death Von Zell died of cancer November 21, 1981, aged 75, at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. Von Zell's body was cremated by the Neptune Society and the ashes were scattered in the sea.

Junior to General Manager Fresh from high school at the age of fifteen, Allen Lambert joined a Victoria, British Columbia branch of the Bank of Toronto in 1927 as an $8-per-week junior clerk. He was recognized as a promising banker early in his career. His first manager reported that the young Lambert was \\"doing very well and seems to have a good grasp of his work. This boy has a good future.\\" Promoted to Accountant in a Vancouver branch, he moved on to Brockville and then to the foreign exchange department at the Montreal main branch. He later observed that \\"We always tried to read something into every move and it was generally thought that if you were selected to go to Montreal someone had noticed you.\\" After service as a naval officer in the North Atlantic during World War II, Lambert became manager of the Yellowknife branch during the gold boom of the late 1940s, and then began a rapid rise through the ranks. He became Assistant General Manager in 1953 and was one of those most intimately involved in the negotiations for the merger of the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank in 1955. As General Manager of the new Toronto-Dominion Bank he managed the delicate business of uniting two corporate cultures and building a style and image for a renewed and ambitious organization. Chief Executive Officer Allen Lambert became President of The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) in 1960 and Chairman the following year. The bank was not in the first rank of financial institutions at the time, and he later recalled that \\"we had all gone through a period of frustration at being smaller than the others, and not being quite able to compete fully.\\" Over the eighteen years of Lambert's leadership, TD became Canada's fastest growing bank and a major presence on the international financial scene. Lambert toured the world seeking business opportunities, opening local offices, and building solid relationships with major clients. He was a tireless promoter of customer service, ensured that the Bank was an innovator in technology, and promoted progressive training and benefit programs for employees. He started TD's corporate art program and, as a centennial project in 1967, developed one of Canada's foremost collections of Inuit art. He combined a demanding life in business with a remarkable record of public and community service, chairing royal commissions and federal advisory bodies, serving as a member of international organizations, and acting as a frequent speaker and essayist on economic issues. Shortly before his retirement in 1978 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in recognition of his contributions to national life. The TD Centre Allen Lambert's most visible achievement, and a source of great personal pride, was the construction of the Toronto Dominion Centre. He viewed it as a tangible statement of the Bank's position in the forefront of industry. After rejecting a number of design proposals, Lambert turned to the great German/American architect Mies van der Rohe to develop a plan for a complex of buildings that would revolutionize the Toronto landscape. Now considered a Mies masterwork, the Centre is a lasting testament to Lambert's vision and imagination. William Thorsell, CEO of the Royal Ontario Museum, wrote in a tribute to Allen Lambert: \\"For those who build, it is not a question of whether a legacy remains, but what its quality is. In Athens, in the Yucatan, in Paris, architecture still speaks eloquently centuries after so much else of value is gone. In 1967, a banker insisted that Toronto be remembered with respect.\\" Honours In 1976, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Professional wrestling career Yoshida debuted for All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW or Zenjo) on October 10, 1988 at Tokyo's Korakuen Hall in a match against Keiko Waki. Before her neck injury in late 1992, which would cause her to miss two years of ring time, Yoshida was easily one of the best young stars in AJW, often showcasing Lucha Libre inspired aerial maneuvers to go along with her matwork skills. In 1997, she left AJW to join Aja Kong's Arsion promotion, becoming their head trainer. There she was repackaged as a technical wrestling master, and was pushed as a major star. She has been nicknamed ARSION no Shinjutsu, or \\"Arsion True Heart\\". Forgoing the high-flying techniques of her run in Zenjo, her style in Arsion was centered on mat wrestling and submission holds derived from shoot wrestling, along with more elaborate lucha-inspired submissions. In June 2005, she launched Ibuki, a bi-monthly event series, with her intention to provide opportunities for young, up and coming wrestlers from different promotions to compete with each other and to challenge senior wrestlers like Yoshida herself. Ibuki has now gained high reputation among joshi puroresu fans in Japan. In 2006, Yoshida was presented with the Cauliflower Alley Club's Future Legend Award, becoming only the second female after Cheerleader Melissa, to win this award.

Although village-sized, with a current population of around 5,023, increasing to 5,519 at the 2011 census for the electoral ward population which includes Countess Wear, which is its own individual settlement, Topsham was designated a town by a 1300 royal charter, until the Exeter urban district was formed. It is served by Topsham railway station on the branch line to Exmouth. In 2011 was the 150th anniversary of the railway coming to Topsham, on what is now called the Exeter–Exmouth Avocet Line.Estuary: The Monthly Community Magazine for Topsham (August 2011, p.32) History The Strand showing some of the houses with Dutch gables The native Celtic settlement of Topsham became the port of the Roman city of Isca Dumnoniorum (Exeter) in the first century AD, and continued to serve it until the Roman occupation of southern Britain ceased about the year 400. In the 7th century the Saxon rule in East Devon saw the settlement grow into a considerable village. St Margaret's Anglican Church in Topsham, dates back to the 10th century. Although reconstructed several times, it remains in its original location as granted in 937 by King Athelstan, who gave \\"a parcel of land, i.e. a manse, which the vulgar called Toppesham, to the monastery Church of St Mary and St Peter in Exeter, for the cure of his soul, to have in eternal freedom so long as the Christian Church shall endure.\\"St Margaret's Church Topsham: History Margate: The Church Publishers, 2010 Topsham's position, offering a sheltered harbour to seagoing trade enabled it to thrive as a port, a centre for both fishing and shipbuilding. Notable ships such as HMS Terror (part of Franklin's lost expedition) and (later known as the USS Cyane after capture by the American Navy) were built here in the early 19th century. The town was the scene of a notable Parliamentarian naval assault during the English Civil War. There are many Dutch style houses in Topsham dating from the time when Topsham was an important cotton port. Many of Topsham's houses are built using Dutch bricks, which were brought over as ballast from Holland – to where the wool and cotton from South-West England had been exported. Topsham was absorbed into the City of Exeter, along with the parishes of Alphington and Pinhoe, in 1966. After a period of decline over the first half of the 20th century, Topsham has increasingly become a desirable and high-value residential location. The 21st century has seen development into the 'Topsham Gap' – greenfield land between Topsham and Exeter. Today left Formerly a major seaport, the town is now of interest for its architecture, scenery and proximity to nature reserves for wading and migrating birds, such as RSPB Bowling Green Marsh on the Exe Estuary, the whole of which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Topsham Museum is located in one of a set of 17th century buildings looking out over the Exe Estuary. It consists of furnished period rooms, displays of the local history of the town and memorabilia of Vivien Leigh, the film star. Name and pronunciation The name is an Anglo-Saxon one, and means Toppa's village, Toppa having been the local landowner. There is some difference of opinion on the correct pronunciation of the town. Generally it is referred to as with the sh sounded as in shoe. The local pronunciation amongst older native Devonians, however, is with the s being sounded as in some and the -ham suffix being reduced to um. Sport Topsham's local football club is Topsham Town AFC, a non-league side in Devon. Topsham Rugby Club has two senior sides and over 200 juniors making it one of the largest \\"junior\\" clubs in the South West. The town also has a bowling club, an outdoor swimming pool and a sailing club.  Community and recreation The Bridge Inn One of the main focal points of the town is Topsham Pool. Topsham Pool is a community run project in the centre of the town. It was funded by a large fundraising exercise in the 1970s which included collecting waste paper and glass bottles, jumble sales and donations. A Sports Council grant completed the fund raising effort and, in 1979, the pool was opened by Olympic gold medallist swimmer David Wilkie. Topsham Pool is an open-air pool and, as a result, is only open between May and September. Between 6 am and 8.30 am each morning, the Pool welcomes the Nutters Club – a group that swims when the outside temperature is likely to be at its coolest. In response to what had been described in the early 1960s as \\"a period of genteel decline\\", The Topsham Society was formed. The objectives of the Topsham Society are \\"To promote high standards of planning and architecture in or affecting Topsham; to educate the public in the geography, history, natural history and architecture of Topsham; to secure the preservation protection development and improvement of features of historic or public interest in Topsham\\". The Society currently has around 400 members. A monthly magazine is published called Estuary: A Monthly Community Magazine for Topsham, which is published by St Margaret's Anglican Church, but is more of a community publication than an ecclesiastical one. It is currently priced £0.70 per month, and copy to be received by the 15th of the preceding month. It is co-edited by Diana Trout and José Northey.

He attended the University of Georgia where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and graduated in 1841. He was married to Mildred Lewis Cobb, a younger sister of Generals Howell and Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb (Howell Cobb later served as Governor of Georgia). An attorney, Glenn represented Henry County in the state legislature as a Democrat before arriving in Atlanta in 1851. Six years later, he was elected mayor and served two consecutive one-year terms. He was the first mayor to appoint regular committees in council for the various functions of city governance: Fire, Streets, Finance, and so on. In March 1861, the Southern states that had seceded from the Union appointed special commissioners to travel to those other slaveholding Southern states that had yet to secede. Glenn served as the Commissioner from Georgia to the Missouri Secession Convention, publicly reading Georgia's Articles of Secession and trying to persuade Missouri politicians to vote to join Georgia in seceding from the Union. During the Civil War, he served first as the company commander of C Company, Cobb's Legion (Infantry), and subsequently as Lt. Colonel of Cobb's Legion. He finished the war as the commander of the Post of Atlanta. In that position, he surrendered the remaining Confederate troops of Atlanta to Col. Beroth B.

Her poetry has been published in a number of collections and anthologies, and she has also published essays, children's books, and plays. She is the pioneer of Limited Fork Theory, a literary theory concerned with the limitations and capacity of human understanding of art. Youth Moss was born Thylias Rebecca Brasier, in a working-class family in Ohio. Her father chose the name Thylias because he decided she needed a name that had not existed before. According to Moss, her first few years of life were happy, living with her family in the upstairs rooms of an older Jewish couple named Feldman (who Moss believes were Holocaust survivors). The Feldmans treated Moss like a grandchild. When Moss was five, the Feldmans sold their house and moved away. Her parents continued to live in the house with the new homeowners and their 13-year-old daughter, Lytta, who began to baby-sit Moss after school. Moss experienced constant harassment from Lytta and several traumatic events before the age of nine.Silberman, Eve, \\"Thylias Moss: A Poet of Many Voices and A Spellbinding Delivery\\", Michigan Today, October 1995, via Modern American Poetry. She later said about her trauma: \\"I never said a word of this to anybody....I was there witnessing things that only happened when I left that house.\\" At age nine her family relocated, causing her to be sent to school in a predominantly white district. After enduring bullying and racism from both her peers and teachers, she withdrew from social interaction at school and did not speak freely in classes until many years later in college. It was during this time she gave more attention to writing poetry, an activity she had begun two years earlier. Adult years Moss married at age 16 before attending Syracuse University from 1971 to 1973. She eventually left university due to racial tensions and entered the workforce for several years. During this time she had two sons, Dennis and Ansted. She enrolled in Oberlin College in 1979 and graduated with a BA in 1981.\\"Thylias Moss\\", Academy of American Poets, poets.org. She later received a Master of Arts in English, with an emphasis on writing, from the University of New Hampshire. After finishing school, Moss taught English at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Since 1993, she has been a Professor of English and a Professor of Art and Design at the University of Michigan\\"Thylias Moss\\", Poetry Foundation. in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Her early work is considered part of the legacy of the Black Arts Movement, taking influence from West African praise poetry and concerning themes of racial justice. Throughout her career, her work has become more experimental, stretching the boundaries of genre and the definition of poetry. Her fixations still include justice, but she expanded into a fascination with text placement's effect on meaning. These experiments with form culminated in her development of Limited Fork Theory and the invention of the POAM (product of act of making). Moss's POAMs are combinations of film and poetry, emphasizing how text placement and movement, among other sensory elements, can enhance the meaning of a poem.  Limited Fork Theory  Moss contributed to experimental literary theory by introducing the metaphor of a fork to conceptualize how people internalize art and literature. The fork as a metaphor for understanding represents bifurcation, and Moss argues that the branching out of the mind to understand art mimics the branching tines of a fork. She uses the word \\"limited\\" to express that, though an observer gains understanding of art through these bifurcated systems of comprehension, the same systems limit their understanding. Just as one can only eat that which adheres to the tines of a fork, one can only internalize the facets of a piece of art that adhere to these bifurcated tines of understanding. The development of Moss's POAMs (products of acts of making) coincided with her theoretical development of Limited Fork. These multimedia pieces use as many sensory elements as possible, including movement, color, and sound. Moss has also expressed interest in incorporating olfactory elements in future projects. These POAMS are usually displayed in galleries, but many can be found online in podcasts, journals, and on YouTube. The complexities associated with the epistemological application of Limited Fork Theory caused Moss to adopt the persona of Forker Girl/Forker Gryle, pseudonyms under which she runs blogs and an Instagram account explaining details of both her life and her theory.

An Imperial Crown is a crown used for the coronation of emperors.  Design  Crowns in Europe during the medieval period varied in design: During the medieval era the crowns worn by English kings had been described as both closed (or arched) and open designs. This was in contrast with kings of France who always wore an open crown. However, there is academic debate on how often closed crowns were used in England during this period, as the first unequivocal use of the closed crown was by Henry IV at his coronation on 13 October 1399.Chris Given-Wilson, Henry IV (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016), pp. 151-52. However his effigy on his tomb in Canterbury Cathedral wears an open crown so the link in England between the style of the crown and its representation as that worn by a king and an emperor was not established. The use of a closed crown may have been adopted by the English as a way of distinguishing the English crown from the French crown, but it also had other meanings to some. For example, Henry V wore a helmet-crown of the arched type at the Battle of Agincourt which the French knight St. Remy commented was \\"like the imperial crown\\". The association of the closed crown with imperial crowns was already established in Continental Europe by the late 14th century, for example the florins minted for Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor) sometimes show him with a closed crown (though on the commoner variety, the crown is open). A miniature picture in the Chronica Aulae Regiae written in the great abbey outside Prague depicts his mother Elizabeth, a queen of Bohemia, wearing an open crown, while his two wives, who had imperial titles, have closed ones. During the machinations that surrounded the introduction of the imperial crown under Henry VIII (see the section below Legal usage), the closed crown, became associated as a symbolic representation of the English Crown as an imperial crown, and has remained so until this day.

The next year the Act of Supremacy (1534) explicitly tied the headship of the church to the imperial crown: :The only supreme head in earth of the Church of England called Anglicana Ecclesia, and shall have and enjoy annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm. During the reign of Mary I the First Act of Supremacy was annulled, but during the reign of Elizabeth I the Second Act of Supremacy, with similar wording to the First Act, was passed in 1559. During the English Interregnum the laws were annulled, but the acts which caused the laws to be in abeyance were themselves, deemed to be null and void by the Parliaments of the English Restoration, so by act of Parliament The Crown of England and (later the British and UK crowns) are imperial crowns.

There is one species of Aquifex with a validly published name – A. pyrophilus – but \\"A. aeolicus\\" is sometimes considered as species though it has no standing as a name given it has not been validly or effectively published. Aquifex spp. are extreme thermophiles, growing best at temperature of 85 °C to 95 °C. They are members of the Bacteria as opposed to the other inhabitants of extreme environments, the Archaea. Aquifex spp. are rod-shaped bacteria with a length of 2 to 6 µm, have a diameter of around 0.5 µm and are motile. They are non- sporeforming, Gram negative autotrophs. Aquifex means water-maker in Latin, and refers to the fact that its method of respiration creates water. Aquifex tend to form cell aggregates composed of up to 100 individual cells. Aquifex spp. are thermophilic and often grow near underwater volcanoes or hot springs. A. aeolicus requires oxygen to survive, but can grow in levels of oxygen as low as 7.5 ppm. A. pyrophilus can even grow anaerobically by reducing nitrogen instead of oxygen. Like other thermophilic bacteria, Aquifex has important uses in industrial processes. The genome of \\"A. aeolicus\\" has been completed., This was made easier by the fact that the length of the genome is only about a third of the length of the genome for E. coli. Comparison of the A. aeolicus genome to other organisms showed that around 16% of its genes originated from the Archaea domain. Members of this genus are thought to be some of the earliest members of the eubacteria domain. \\"A. aeolicus\\" was discovered north of Sicily, while A. pyrophilus was first found just north of Iceland.  Genome Structure  The complete genome for A. aeolicus consists of 1,551,335 base pairs with over 1500 open reading frames (ORFs) or chromosomal coding sequences. An extremely large portion (over 90%) of the genome are protein- coding regions and there are no significant non-coding repeats. though the A. aeolicus genome is dense, many enzyme subunits used for respiration processes are found in separate operons. Any repairs to the genome are done by a protein like DNA polymerase beta found in most eukaryotes.  Cell Metabolism  Aquifex respiration and fixation pathways use similar pathways to that of other autotrophic bacteria. Carbon fixation is done using the reductive TCA cycle and forms acetyl-CoA as well as many other bio-synthetic materials. Many bacterium use products from the TCA cycle in the pentose-phosphate pathway and Entner-Doudoroff pathway or Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway however, many enzymes that are necessary for these gluconeogenic processes have not been identified in A. aeolicus suggesting a different pathway might be used. A. aeolicus needs oxygen at concentrations higher than 7.5 p.p.m to perform respiration while A. pyrophilus is capable of respiration with nitrogen however, both species have a nitrate reductase and nitrate transporter genes located within their genome. the enzymes used in other bacterium for oxygen respiration are used by Aquifex. Many other oxidoreductases are present however their physiological role is unknown. Aquifex oxides thiosulfate, molecular hydrogen, and sulfur within their respiratory pathway.  Phylogeny  Phylogenetic trees that are based on small subunit rRNA suggest that Aquificales are some of the earliest bacteria that branched from Archaea. However, phylogenetic trees based on protein contradict this argument. The exact phylogeny is hard to determine because of this and the many horizontal gene transfers within the lineage. These factors lead many to believe the phylum of Aquifex is basal next to Thermotogae, another hyperthermophilic phylum, or are a part of the Epsilonproteobacteria, a highly diverse group of hydrothermal dwelling species.  Research Potential  A. aeolicus is used as a model organism for hyperthermophilic bacterium. Many studies have looked at the Aquifex hydrogenases ability to preform the reversible oxidation of dihydrogen (the oxidation reaction) at extremely high temperatures. The success of the properties within the hydrogenases of Aquifex mark the genus as a possible renewable bio-catalysts for hydrogen based fuel cells.

Nelson, was an early DeKalb County settler who operated Nelson's Ferry across the Chattahoochee River until murdered by John W. Davis in 1825. Political career In a close election for mayor, Nelson, running as a Democrat, defeated the Know Nothing candidate, Ira O. McDaniel, but resigned in July when the city council reduced a fine he had levied on two young men for destroying city property, thus leaving John Glen as the acting mayor. Nelson left for Kansas during the border disputes, then moved to Meridian, Texas, where he was involved with Indian affairs, serving under Lawrence S. Ross, and in 1860 was elected to the legislature. Military service and death During the Mexican–American War, Nelson served as a captain in the Kennesaw Rangers with another future mayor, Cicero C. Hammock, as well as the father of mayor John B. Goodwin – Williamson H. Goodwin. Nelson later served as a brigadier general under General Narciso López, in a failed attempt to free Cuba from Spain. He organized and served as colonel of the 10th Texas Infantry Regiment in the Confederate States Army. He was later promoted brigadier general but contracted typhus and died.

It was nominated for a BAFTA Film Award for Best Documentary and, for a time, the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, before being disqualified after it was discovered that the film was first released prior to the eligibility period. Original music was by Ron Grainer. The film covers both staff and passengers around the station. The trains are still pulled by steam locomotives. The most unusual section is the enquiry centre: some two dozen people taking telephone calls with questions about travel. The boat-train \\"Victoria Castle\\" arrives and passengers are greeted by friends. A group of prisoners, handcuffed in pairs, are placed in a carriage whilst the general public are held back by police. The lost property office is filled with umbrellas. A coffin is placed in the guard van. A large group of Jamaicans board the train to Southampton. A young boy, Matthew Perry, is traumatised as the police take him to an office where an announcement is made for his mother to collect him. Late at night girls drink Kia-Ora and sailors smoke cigarettes. Some travellers sleep on benches. A homeless bag-lady wanders aimlessly, checking rubbish bins for food. In fact, many of the supposedly 'reportage' shots were staged.

EAGs are a member of the family of two-level grammars; more specifically, a restriction of Van Wijngaarden grammars with the specific purpose of making parsing feasible. Like Van Wijngaarden grammars, EAGs have hyperrules that form a context-free grammar except in that their nonterminals may have arguments, known as affixes, the possible values of which are supplied by another context-free grammar, the metarules. EAGs were introduced and studied by D.A. Watt in 1974; recognizers were developed at the University of Nijmegen between 1985 and 1995. The EAG compiler developed there will generate either a recogniser, a transducer, a translator, or a syntax directed editor for a language described in the EAG formalism. The formalism is quite similar to Prolog, to the extent that it borrowed its cut operator. EAGs have been used to write grammars of natural languages such as English, Spanish, and Hungarian. The aim was to verify the grammars by making them parse corpora of text (corpus linguistics); hence, parsing had to be sufficiently practical. However, the parse tree explosion problem that ambiguities in natural language tend to produce in this type of approach is worsened for EAGs because each choice of affix value may produce a separate parse, even when several different values are equivalent. The remedy proposed was to switch to the much simpler Affix Grammar over a Finite Lattice (AGFL) instead, in which metagrammars can only produce simple finite languages.Affix grammars for natural languages, by C.H.A.

The company is owned by Caterpillar through its subsidiary Progress Rail Services. Electro-Motive Diesel traces its roots to the Electro-Motive Engineering Corporation, a designer and marketer of gasoline-electric self-propelled rail cars founded in 1922 and later renamed Electro-Motive Company (EMC). In 1930, General Motors purchased Electro-Motive Company and the Winton Engine Co. and in 1941 expanded EMC's realm to locomotive engine manufacturing as Electro- Motive Division (EMD). In 2005, GM sold EMD to Greenbriar Equity Group and Berkshire Partners, which formed Electro-Motive Diesel to facilitate the purchase. In 2010, Progress Rail Services completed the purchase of Electro- Motive Diesel from Greenbriar, Berkshire, and others. EMD's headquarters, engineering facilities and parts manufacturing operations are based in McCook, Illinois, while its final locomotive assembly line is located in Muncie, Indiana. EMD also operates a traction motor maintenance, rebuild and overhaul facility in San Luis Potosí, Mexico. As of 2008, EMD employed approximately 3,260 people, and in 2010 it held approximately 30 percent of the market for diesel-electric locomotives in North America.  History  =Early years= 1920s gasoline-electric railcar Burlington Zephyr, powered by EMC diesel- electric drive EMC E1, one of EMC's earliest standard production model locomotives FT demonstrator unit EMD 103 at the California State Railroad Museum in 1991 Harold L. Hamilton and Paul Turner founded the Electro-Motive Engineering Corporation in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1922, soon renaming it to Electro-Motive Company (EMC). At Google Books The company developed and marketed self-propelled railcars using General Electric's newly developed internal combustion-electric propulsion and control systems. Hamilton started his railroading career as a fireman, then locomotive engineer, on the Southern Pacific Railroad, then became a manager with the Florida East Coast Railway before he left railroading for a marketing position with the White Motor Company, an early manufacturer of trucks and buses, in Denver. Training and service agreements were part of White's marketing package that Hamilton would carry over to EMC. Aware of the needs of branch line services of railroads and the opportunities provided with GE's new internal combustion-electric propulsion and control technology, he quit his position with White and set up shop in a Chicago hotel with his partner and a designer to develop and market a new generation of self-propelled railcars. In 1923 EMC sold two gasoline- powered rail motor cars, one to the Chicago Great Western and the other to the Northern Pacific. EMC subcontracted the body construction to St. Louis Car Company, electrical components to General Electric, and the prime mover to the Winton Engine Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The motorcars were delivered in 1924 and worked well, fortunate for the fledgling company, because the sales were conditional on satisfactory performance. In 1925 EMC entered full-scale production, selling 27 railcars. In 1930 General Motors (GM) was seeking to enter production of diesel engines and broaden their range of applications. They purchased the Winton Engine Company, who had in their product line a variety of stationary and marine diesel engines and spark-ignition engines for heavy vehicles. GM saw EMC's role in developing and marketing Winton-engined heavy vehicles as fitting their objectives and purchased the company shortly after the Winton acquisition, renaming it Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC). Supported by the GM Research Division headed by Charles F. Kettering, GM's Winton Engine Corporation focused on developing diesel engines with improved power-to-weight ratios and output flexibility suitable for mobile use. Eugene W. Kettering, son of Charles Kettering, led Winton's side of the development project. In 1933 EMC designed the power setups for the Zephyr and M-10000 streamliners, a breakthrough in the power and speed available with their propulsion systems. The Zephyr used the first major product of the new GM- Winton venture, a 600 hp, eight cylinder version of the Winton 201A Roots blown, uniflow scavenged, unit injected, 2-stroke diesel engine. As the Budd and Pullman-Standard companies entered contracts to build more diesel-powered streamliners, they became major customers for EMC. Diesel power had been shown suitable for small, lightweight, high speed trains, in addition to its more established role in yard service. Seeing opportunities to broaden the role of diesel in railroading, EMC invested in a new locomotive factory and started development work on the locomotives that it would produce. The factory headquarters on 55th Street in McCook, Illinois, west of Chicago, remains the corporate headquarters. The 1935 EMC 1800 hp B-B development design locomotives featured the multiple-unit control systems that became the basis of cab/booster locomotive sets, and the twin engine format that would be adopted for the newest Zephyr power units in 1936 and EMC's E series streamlined passenger locomotives that their new factory began producing in 1937. Prior to their introduction of the E units EMC was in production of switch engines, which remained the mainstay of their production until dieselization of freight and passenger service hit full stride in the mid-1940s. The GM-Winton research and development effort continued through the mid-1930s, building on experience with the Winton 201A, to develop diesel engines to better meet the specific needs of locomotive use. The fruit of that effort was GM's new 567 engine, introduced by their renamed Cleveland Diesel Engine Division in 1938. The new engine upgraded the horsepower of EMC's E series locomotives to 2000 per locomotive unit and increased reliability substantially. Also in 1938, EMC increased its reach up the chain of locomotive production by transitioning from General Electric equipment to in- house produced generators and traction motors. With Eugene Kettering moving to EMC that year, EMC moved into a leading role in further development of GM's locomotive engines. GM-Winton-EMC's long development efforts put the company in an advantageous position relative to other developers of diesel-electric locomotion. Their nearest competitor was the American Locomotive Company (ALCO), who had produced diesel-electric switch engines since the mid-1920s, provided motive power for the Rebel streamliner trainsets in 1935, and started production of development design locomotives to compete with the E-units in 1939. EMC's other main competitor, the Baldwin Locomotive Works, had their development work with diesel delayed by their belief through the 1930s that the future of mainline service remained with steam, and by financial difficulties that effectively froze their diesel development while EMC and ALCO continued theirs. Baldwin started producing diesel-electric switch engines in 1939. Passenger trains made little money for the railroads, but replacement of steam engines with reliable diesel units could provide railroads with a crucial difference for profitability. With standardized production of locomotives, EMC simplified the processes for ordering, manufacturing, and servicing locomotives and introduced economies of scale that would lower unit costs. EMC offered support services including financing, training, and field maintenance that would ease the transition from steam to diesel and boost their market in the last years before US entry into World War II. The performance of the new 567 engine in passenger locomotives also built confidence in the viability of diesel power for freight service. In 1939 the company built a four-unit freight locomotive demonstrator, the FT, and began a tour of the continent's railroads. The tour was a success. Western railroads in particular saw that the diesels could free them from dependence on scarce water supplies for steam locomotives. In 1940, after incorporating dynamic braking at the suggestion of customers, they were receiving their first orders for the new freight locomotive. =1940-1960= Burlington Northern EMD F3 General Motors moved production of locomotive engines under the authority of EMC to create the GM Electro-Motive Division (EMD) on January 1, 1941. With that move, EMD became a fully self-contained development, production, marketing, and service entity. Nonlocomotive products (large marine and stationary diesel engines) continued under GM's Cleveland Diesel Engine Division for another twenty years. In January 1941 EMD delivered the first FT unit to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, numbered Unit 100, and through that year they were in full-stride production of road and switch locomotives. World War II temporarily slowed EMD's locomotive production; Navy ships gained priority for diesel power and the petroleum crisis of 1942-43 made coal-fired steam a more attractive option. The War Production Board stopped production of new passenger equipment between September 1942 and December 1944. Later in the war, diesel locomotive production for freight service was picking up as more locomotives were needed to haul wartime supplies. By the time the FT model was replaced in 1945, 555 cab units and 541 booster units had been produced. EMD emerged from the war years with major advantages for over competitors in diesel locomotive production, having entered them with fully developed lines of mainline road diesel locomotives while war production allocations restricted their competitors, principally the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and the Baldwin Locomotive Works, to selling mainly diesel switchers and steam locomotives of pre-existing designs. That gave an advantage to EMD's state of technical development with higher powered diesels in the critical postwar years. New model passenger locomotives were delivered starting in February 1945. New models of their freight locomotive followed later in 1945 and 1946. By the late 1940s the vast majority of American railroads had decided to dieselize their locomotive fleets. Passenger services facing increasing competition from air and automotive travel rapidly replaced steam for image and cost reasons, but the biggest growth market was for freight locomotives. To meet post-war demands, EMD opened another locomotive production facility in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1948. ALCO-GE was EMD's strongest competitor during the dieselization era, having produced the first road-switcher diesel locomotives in 1941 and gained about a 26% market share of diesel locomotives, mostly for switching and short-haul applications, as of 1946. ALCO's higher-powered locomotives for mainline service were less successful, as they were plagued by reliability problems. In 1948 the ALCO-GE partnership developed a prototype gas-turbine-electric locomotive; series production began in 1952. Latecomers to the diesel locomotive business Baldwin, Fairbanks-Morse, and Lima-Hamilton struggled in the market as their products failed to gain a solid reputation. By 1950 it was clear that EMD's competitors could not crack their position in mainline road diesels and in 1949 their new EMD GP7 road switcher locomotive invaded the market niche previously held by ALCO and Baldwin. In 1950, EMD's new plant in London, Ontario, Canada, began production. The plant was operated by the Canadian subsidiary General Motors Diesel (GMD), producing existing EMD as well as unique GMD designs for the Canadian domestic and export markets. GMD were, as a Canadian concern, able to sell products to other British Commonwealth nations without the tariffs encumbering trade with non- Commonwealth nations, gaining a significant international market advantage for GM in the locomotive business. thumb EMD's road-switcher locomotives with power and reliability sufficient for mainline use overturned the market for freight locomotives, soon displacing their competitors' road-switchers, then later their own F-series carbody locomotives. The GP9 became the most-produced EMD model ever, with 4,112 A units and 165 B units sold between 1954 and 1963. Owing to their ease of maintenance and versatility, most locomotives sold in North America since the introduction of the GP9 have been road-switcher, or hood, units. Flush-sided locomotives based on a road-switcher chassis, or cowl units, would later be produced for passenger service. During the mid-1950s, more difficult market conditions followed the peak demand of the dieselization era. The 1950s saw collapse in the positions of all of EMD's established competitors and the strong emergence of a new one, the General Electric Company. Lima-Hamilton failed first, in 1951 merging with Baldwin to form Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton. Baldwin's own position was precarious, with their market share dwindling until they left the locomotive business in 1956. Fairbanks-Morse, after struggling to maintain a foothold in the industry with their opposed piston marine powerplant, left the locomotive field in 1963. General Electric dissolved the ALCO-GE partnership in the wake of ALCO's lackluster efforts at developing reliable higher-powered engines, and took over the ALCO-GE gas-turbine-electric venture in 1953. In 1956 GE was marketing its own Universal series Cooper-Bessemer powered diesel-electrics as export locomotives. ALCO's belated introduction of improved locomotive power in 1956 provided the company little benefit; they no longer had the marketing, financing, or service support of GE and the GP9 was a formidable competitor in the saturated domestic market. In 1960 the U25B was the first of GE's road locomotives powered by their FDL-16 diesel engine, which would rapidly displace ALCO's position and eventually displace EMD's position in the domestic market. Competition from the two giants with large capital resources overwhelmed ALCO until they went out of business in 1969. The 567 engine was continuously improved and upgraded. The original six-cylinder 567 produced , the V-12 , and the V-16 . EMD began turbocharging the 567 around 1958; the final version, the 567D3A (built from October, 1963, to about January, 1966) produced in its V-16 form. =1960–1985= EMD SD40-2 As the 1960s opened EMD was compelled to respond to the challenge offered by GE's U25B, upgrading the features of their GP (General Purpose) and SD (Special Duty/Standard Duty) series locomotives, boosting the power of their 567 engines, then developing the more powerful 645 engines. Those endeavors as well as the feature upgrades introduced with the SD40-2 were sufficient to maintain EMD's competitive advantage over GE until the mid-1980s. In 1962 GM moved their remaining production of large nonlocomotive diesel engines from Cleveland to the EMD facility in McCook, ending the existence of the Cleveland Diesel Engine Division.https://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=CDEDOGMC In late 1965, EMD introduced the enlarged 645 engine. Power ratings were V-12 nonturbocharged, V-8 turbocharged, V-12 turbocharged, V-16 nonturbocharged, and V-16 turbocharged. In late 1965 EMD built their first twenty-cylinder engine, a turbocharged V20 for the EMD SD45. The final variant of the sixteen cylinder 645 (the 16-645F) produced . In 1972, EMD introduced modular control systems with the Dash-2 line; the EMD SD40-2 became one of the most successful diesel locomotive designs in history, both in terms of sales and service longevity. A total of 3,945 SD40-2 units were built. EMD introduced their new 710 engine in 1984 with the 60 Series locomotives (EMD SD60 and EMD GP60), the EMD 645 engine continued to be offered in certain models (such as the 50 Series) until 1988. The 710 is produced as an eight-, twelve-, sixteen-, and twenty-cylinder engine for locomotive, marine and stationary applications. Concurrently with the introduction of the 710, EMD's control systems on locomotives changed to microprocessors, with computer-controlled wheel slip prevention, among other systems. =1985–2000= thumb EMD's North American market share dropped below that of its main competitor General Electric in 1987. After the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 1989, EMD decided to consolidate all locomotive production at the Diesel Division of General Motors of Canada (formerly GMD) plant in London, Ontario, a development which ended locomotive production at the La Grange, Illinois plant in 1991, although the Illinois facility continued to produce engines and generators. In the late 1980s and 1990s EMD introduced AC induction motor drive in EMD locomotives using Siemens technology.Sources:  In the early 1990s, EMD introduced the radial steering truck, which reduced wheel and track wear. In 1995 EMD replaced mechanical unit injectors with electronically controlled unit injectors on its 710 engines. In 1998 EMD introduced the four-stroke sixteen cylinder 265H-Engine, used as the prime mover in the EMD SD90MAC-H locomotive. Instead of completely replacing the 710 series engine, the H-engine was concurrently produced alongside EMD's two stroke engines, although mainly for export. Acceptance of the 265H was limited over reliability issues. The 265H, at , was the most powerful engine ever produced by EMD and the first four-stroke engine offered to the market by EMD or its ancestral companies since the Winton 201A introduced their breakthrough in two-stroke diesel power in 1934. In 1999, Union Pacific placed the largest single order for diesel locomotives in North American railroad history when they ordered 1,000 units of the EMD SD70M. Union Pacific's fleet of SD70Ms has since been expanded by more than 450 additional units. In addition, Union Pacific also owns nearly 500 EMD SD70ACe's, six of which have been painted in \\"Fallen Flags\\" (acquired/merged railroads) commemorative liveries. All of these locomotives are 710G-powered. =2000–present= EMD SD70M-2 The year 2004 saw CSX Transportation take delivery of the first SD70ACe units, which were advertised by EMD as more reliable, fuel efficient, and easier to maintain than predecessor model SD70MAC. The model meets the EPA Tier 2 emission requirements using the two- stroke 710 diesel engine. The following year Norfolk Southern became the first carrier to receive the new SD70M-2 - successor to the SD70M. Like its sister roadswitcher, the SD70ACe, the SD70M-2 meets EPA Tier 2 requirements using the same engine. And like the \\"ACe\\", the \\"M-2\\" is certified to be in conformance with ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004.EMD:ISO Certifications In June 2004, The Wall Street Journal published an article indicating EMD was being put up for sale. On January 11, 2005, Reuters published a story indicating a sale to \\"two private U.S. equity groups\\" was likely to be announced \\"this week\\". Confirmation came the following day, with a press release issued by General Motors, stating it had agreed to sell EMD to a partnership led by Greenbriar Equity Group LLC and Berkshire Partners LLC. The newly spun-off company was called Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc., thus retaining the famous \\"EMD\\" initials. The sale closed on April 4, 2005. On June 1, 2010, Caterpillar Inc. announced it had agreed to buy Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. from Greenbriar, Berkshire et al. for $820 million. Caterpillar's wholly owned subsidiary, Progress Rail Services Corporation, completed the transaction on August 2, 2010, making Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Progress Rail Services Corporation. Although Caterpillar announced that John S. Hamilton would continue in his roles of president and CEO of EMD after the close of the transaction, Mr. Hamilton left EMD for unspecified reasons in late August 2010. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Tier-4 locomotive emissions regulations on new locomotives went into effect on January 1, 2015. As of that date EMD's 710-engined locomotives (e.g. SD70ACe's) could be built only for use outside the contiguous United States (i.e. Canada, Alaska, Mexico, and overseas). EMD had originally thought the 710 engine could be modified or \\"tuned-up\\" to meet Tier-4 standards, but it was not able to meet those requirements while maintaining optimum performance and reliability during rigorous \\"real world conditions\\" tests. Development of a Tier-4-compliant locomotive shifted from its original focus on the two-stroke 710 to the four- stroke 1010J engine, derived from the 265H engine. The first (pre-production) locomotive using the 1010J engine, the SD70ACe-T4, using a (4,400 traction hp) 12 cylinder engine was unveiled in late 2015. Testing of the new locomotives began in the Spring of 2016. The first two units of a 65 unit order for the new locomotive were delivered to Union Pacific in December 2016. EMD continues to offer 710-powered locomotives for export as well as \\"ECO\\" upgrade packages for modernizing of older locomotives, which sustained their business during the hiatus of locomotive production for the domestic market. Manufacturing and assembly facilities EMD currently maintains major facilities in McCook, Illinois, and Muncie, Indiana in the United States, Sete Lagoas, Brazil and San Luis Potosí, Mexico. The company operated a manufacturing facility in London, Ontario, Canada until its closure in 2012. =EMD La Grange (McCook)= Postcard depiction of the plant circa late 1930s. (Denver Zephyr train inset top left) Since its ground breaking in 1935, the La Grange facility has been the headquarters for EMD. In addition to the corporation's administrative offices, La Grange houses design engineering, emissions testing, rebuild operations, and manufacturing of major components, including prime mover engines, traction alternators, electrical cabinets, and turbochargers. The La Grange facility includes three main buildings, with over of office and manufacturing space. Ancillary buildings are used to provide maintenance and testing capabilities. EMD La Grange is ISO 9001:2008 Certified for Quality and ISO 14001 Certified for Environmental Management. A large part of the property's land has been sold off including the land where the original factory building stood. With the sale of the land, the large sign of \\"Electro Motive Division\\" that stood at the corner of 55th St. and East Ave. was removed but is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum. =EMD London= The EMD London plant, in London, Ontario, Canada, opened in 1949 under EMD's Canadian subsidiary General Motors Diesel, Ltd., to produce locomotives during a time of rapidly rising demand. EMD London's Canadian location was useful for General Motors' when attempting to procure Canadian federal contracts and serve Canadian rail customers. Situated on a site, the EMD London facility included two main buildings and multiple ancillary buildings with over of office and manufacturing space, as well as a locomotive test track. Following reorganization under the Diesel Division of General Motors of Canada in 1969, the facility was at times used to produce a variety of products in the General Motors family, including transit buses (until 1979) and military vehicles. Following passage of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1989, EMD London became the location where all of the construction, finishing, and testing of EMD locomotives in North America was performed. The facility also manufactured components such as locomotive underframes, traction motors, truck assemblies, and locomotive equipment racks. The rate of production was approximately one locomotive completed per day. EMD London was ISO 9001:2000 Certified for Quality and ISO 14001 Certified for Environmental Management. Following prolonged stagnation in EMD's North American market over the preceding years, the plant was closed in 2012 to reduce labor costs. Work was shifted to the new plant in Muncie, Ind. to take advantage of weak unions and lower pay in the U.S. market. In January 2012, 450 Canadian Auto Workers union workers were locked out of the EMD London facility, after refusing to ratify EMD's proposed new contract which included a pay cut of 50% for some workers - labour costs at the Canadian plant were much greater than in some of the company's US plants. In February 2012 Progress Rail Services announced the closure of the plant; Caterpillar's actions were criticised in Canada; the company stated it would relocate production to other sites in North and South America, including the non-unionised plant in Muncie, Indiana. At the time of closure the plant employed approximately 775 people directly. =EMD San Luis Potosí= On April 14, 2010, Electro-Motive opened a facility in San Luis Potosí, Mexico for the maintenance, rebuild, and overhaul of traction motors and other electrical equipment. =EMD Muncie= In October 2010, Caterpillar Inc. announced it was investing US$50 million to acquire and to renovate an existing building for assembly of EMD brand locomotives and to build a locomotive test track on a site located in Muncie, Indiana. The Muncie facility allows EMD to supply locomotives to publicly funded passenger rail agencies that require their rail equipment be assembled in the United States exclusively. (see Buy America Act.) On July 25, 2011, it was announced that production at the facility was planned to begin by the end of the year, with 125 workers having been hired and plans to add more. On October 28, the plant was officially opened, and the first locomotive produced at the plant, a Ferromex SD70ACe #4092, was rolled out. =Subcontractors and licensees= Victorian Railways S class (EMD A7) locomotive, built by Australian licensee Clyde Engineering The company also entered into subcontracting and licensing arrangements, both for whole locomotives, and diesel and electrical drivetrains (genset plus traction motors and control electronics) In Europe licensees included Henschel (Germany), 1950s-80s which manufactured locomotives for export to African, South Asian, and Scandinavian counties as well as Austria;Larry Russell, \\"EMD Export Page\\", Henschel NOHAB (Sweden), 1950s-70s,Larry Russell, \\"EMD Export Page\\", NOHAB and after NOHAB's closure Kalmar Verkstad (KVAB) (Sweden), 1980s.

Đuro Đaković of Croatia (Yugoslavia) also held a license from EMD and manufactured locomotives for the Yugoslav Railways. By 2000 EMD had produced with its collaborators around 300 locomotives using EMD technology in Scandinavia, 500 in western Europe, and 400 in eastern Europe.Sources: ,alternative link via findarticles.com Approximately 75% of EMD's European locomotives sold by 2000 were license built in Europe. The company also entered into a collaboration (early 2000s) with Lyudinovsky Locomotive Plant (Russia) (Людиновский тепловозостроительный завод), (now part of Sinara Group) creating a single-body eight axle 3MW (Bo'Bo')'(Bo'Bo')' diesel locomotive ТЭРА1, powered by an EMD 710 16-cylinder engine. In the early 2010s the company began a collaboration with Croatian rolling stock company TŽV Gredelj.

In China CNR Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Company has manufactured the EMD- designed units China Railways HXN3 (JT56ACe) since 2008. In 2012 the EMD formed a joint venture with Barloworld, Electro-Motive Diesel Africa (Proprietary) Limited, to supply locomotive and rail related products to the sub-saharan African market.Sources:  In September 2012, EMD also signed a deal with Bombardier Transportation; Bombardier's factory in Savli, in India, would assemble EMD products for Asian customers. Maintenance and support facilities EMD also provides maintenance services, technical support, parts inventory, and sales and marketing services from many other locations spread throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, China, India, Pakistan, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Brazil, Egypt, and South Africa. Engines =Locomotive engines= EMD has produced the following series of engines: * EMD 567 – The 567 was produced from 1938 through 1965, named for its displacement-per-cylinder of 567.45 in³ (bore 8½ inches, stroke 10 inches). Other design features: two-cycle (or two-stroke), Roots-blown, Uniflow-scavenged, Unit-injected, overhead camshafts, four exhaust valves per cylinder. Built in V-6, V-8, V-12 and V-16 configurations. 567AC, 567BC, 567C, 567D and \\"567E\\" engines may be retrofitted with 645 Power assemblies and other major components, mainly for so-called \\"life-extension\\" programs; 567E engines are actually 645E blocks which were originally manufactured with 567 power assemblies * EMD 645 – \\"E- and F-Engines\\"; Currently in production by request; most 645 major assemblies remain in new production for replacement purposes * EMD 710 – \\"G-Engine\\"; Currently in production, but restricted to use outside the U.S. due to EPA Tier 4 emissions regulations taking effect in 2015; unit injectors on pre-1995 engines, electronically controlled unit injectors on post-1995 engines * EMD 265 – \\"H-Engine\\"; no longer in domestic production, and most existing 265-powered locomotives in North America have been removed from service. * EMD 1010 – \\"J-Engine\\"; Currently in production. First introduced at the Railway Interchange Expo 2015 at BNSF North Town Yard, Minneapolis, Minnesota, from October 4 to October 7, 2015. This new engine is first used on SD70ACe-T4, the new Tier 4 freight locomotive from EMD. This engine features a two-stage turbocharging system consisting of three turbochargers: one turbo (the primary/high pressure turbo) for low-mid RPM range and two turbos (the secondary/low pressure turbos) for mid-high RPM range. The results are bigger power throughout a broader RPM range, better fuel efficiency, and lower emissions. =Stationary and marine engines= Most of the above locomotive engines were available, in modified form, for stationary and marine work. Marine engines differ from railroad and stationary engines mainly in the shape and depth of the engine's oil sump, which has been altered to accommodate the rolling and pitching motions encountered in marine applications. EMD 'pancake' diesels A new aluminum block lightweight compact engine was designed that ran at a higher rpm. These engines feature a vertical crankshaft and the cylinders were arranged in an X pattern of four cylinder banks in four cylinder rows. These were the 16-184 and 16-338 \\"pancake\\" engines. The 16-388 engine was from the base of the generator to the top of the air intake filter and wide. It is a mechanically injected two- stroke diesel engine that used a Roots blower. The 16-184A was installed in some subchasers of the during World War II. The two 16-184A diesel engines driving two shafts produced a faster subchaser that achieved 21 knots.http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/150499.htm The EMD 16-338 developed at 1600 rpm. On the top was an air intake then four layers of four cylinders each. Each cylinder had a bore and a stroke. On the bottom of the crank shaft was an Elliot generator which developed 817 kW at a maximum of 710 volts DC. This proved problematic as the engine fluids ran down into the generator. The whole engine weighed just over eight tons. Being 4 feet wide it allowed for four engines in an engine room only long and also allowed design engineers to eliminate a submarine engine room.http://www.ss563.org/t-class.html The and the research submarine used the troublesome EMD 16-338. On the Tang-class the Navy decided to replace the \\"pancake\\" engines with ten-cylinder Fairbanks- Morse opposed-piston 38D 8-1/8 diesels. The unreliability and lack of spares led to the decommissioning of USS Albacore in 1972 as further cannibalized parts became unavailable.https://oldmachinepress.wordpress.com/2014/08/17/general-motors- electro-motive-16-184-diesel-engine/ Reporting marks The following reporting marks are listed for rolling stock: * EMDX – Electro-Motive Division Leasing * EMLX – Electro-Motive Division Leasing * GMCX – General Motors Corporation * GMDX – General Motors Diesel Canada  See also  * List of GM- EMD locomotives References =Notes= =Sources=   External links  * EMD website (archived, 8 Feb 2014) * Progress Rail, current parent company * EMD China (archived, 30 Jul 2010) * EMD Locomotives at The- Bluprints.com] * Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1922 Category:Locomotive engine manufacturers Category:History of Cleveland Category:Companies based in Cook County, Illinois Category:La Grange, Illinois Category:Locomotive manufacturers of the United States Category:Locomotive manufacturers of Canada Category:General Motors subsidiaries Category:Caterpillar Inc. subsidiaries Category:Diesel engine manufacturers Category:American brands Category:1922 establishments in Ohio Category:Engine manufacturers of the United States ","title":"Electro-Motive Diesel"},{"id":"1968565","text":"Henrik Reuterdahl (September 11, 1795 in Malmö - June 28, 1870 in Uppsala) was a Swedish Lutheran clergyman who served as the Church of Sweden archbishop of Uppsala from 1856 to his death.

Freight barges being transported on the Arkansas River collided with a pier supporting the Interstate 40 road bridge crossing the river. The resulting failure of the supports caused a section of the bridge to collapse, killing 14 people and injuring another 11. The collision was determined to have resulted from a loss of consciousness on the part of the captain of the barges' towboat.  Collision and collapse  Joe Dedmon, captain of the towboat Robert Y. Love, was transporting barges on the Arkansas River. While traversing the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, Dedmon experienced a syncopal episode and lost control of the tow. This, in turn, caused the barges he was towing to collide with a pier of the Interstate 40 bridge crossing the reservoir. A section of the bridge collapsed, plunging into the water. By the time traffic stopped and individuals became aware of the missing road, eight passenger vehicles and three semi-trucks had fallen into the river or on collapsed bridge pieces. Fourteen people died and eleven others were injured when the automobiles and tractor-trailers fell from the bridge. Survivors were aided by fishermen who were participating in a bass fishing tournament in the river near the bridge.  Rescue and recovery  Three people that had fallen into the river in their vehicles were able to get out and swim to shore. Whilst participating in a bass fishing tournament, fishermen on the water saw the disaster occurring and attempted to aid the victims and stop the cars and trucks they witnessed driving towards the bridge failure. One fisherman along the river shot a flare at a tractor-trailer driver in an attempt to get the truck to stop. Others threw ropes at individuals in vehicles to attempt to pull them from the water. The two-time convicted felon William James Clark impersonated a U.S. Army captain at the disaster scene for two days. Clark's efforts included directing FBI agents and appropriating vehicles and equipment for the rescue effort, before fleeing the scene. Clark was later apprehended in Canada. An estimated 20,000 vehicles per day were rerouted for about two months while crews rebuilt the bridge. Traffic resumed July 29, 2002—two months after the disaster. The reopening set a new national record for such a project, which would normally be expected to take six months.  Investigation and litigation  It was reported that the towboat Robert Y. Love had problems with steering back in 1994, although Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Natalie Magnino stated that the 1994 problem was caused by debris that had jammed the rudder and was not the result of mechanical failure or pilot error. The National Transportation Safety Board stated in 2004 that the collapse was due to Captain Dedmon's loss of consciousness, possibly due to an unforeseeable abnormal heart rhythm. Indiana University Professor of Medicine Douglas Zipes, agreed with this explanation and stated in a letter to Dedmon's attorney that it was likely that Dedmon had ventricular tachycardia, which caused him to black out. As a result of the accident the Safety Board recommended that the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center evaluate the utility and effectiveness of alerter systems within the wheelhouse of inland towing vessels. This was in addition to warning systems for motorists to stop in the case of a partial or total bridge collapse. In May 2003, victims of the bridge collapse settled a lawsuit with the towboat company. The Mississippi-based company Magnolia Marine Transport Co. settled with the 14 deceased victims' families and those injured for an undisclosed amount. This is separate from the other suits against the company by the state of Oklahoma and by MBO Video, whose fiber optic cables were severed by the collapse.  Memorials  On Memorial Day 2003, that year on May 26, a memorial statue was dedicated by Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry in Webbers Falls, Oklahoma. Webbers Falls marked the 15th Anniversary of the bridge collapse with a special ceremony at the Webbers Falls Historical City Park, with the monument in honor of those who were affected by the accident. The town created a memorial statue in honor of the victims and the event, a 14-foot-tall bronze sculpture that incorporates pieces of the wreckage and is topped by a young girl reaching upwards to release a dove. The young girl represents the youngest victim, a 3-year-old girl. It was created by Shahla Rahimi-Reynolds, who was chosen by the Webbers Falls Committee to design the memorial, which also uses 14 granite plaques to memorialize each victim. The memorial was dedicated on May 26, 2003. The memorial cost the state almost $150,000.

Founded in 1886 by Pierre Lorillard IV, its facilities now include an 18-hole golf course, lawn tennis, court tennis, racquets, squash, platform tennis, olympic- sized pool, and boating. The tuxedo was introduced by New York millionaire James Potter at the club's first Autumn ball in 1886, after a trip to England. History The original clubhouse, designed by Bruce Price, was built in 1886 and demolished in 1927. John Russell Pope's clubhouse was constructed on the original stone foundations the following year. The clubhouse is U-shaped, with stucco over wood frame, low hipped slate roof, stone embedded in stucco, leaded glass casements, and mullions forming crossettes in continuous fenestration. Located at the foot of Tuxedo Lake, it commands a view to the other end of lake and two ranges of wooded hills. A lawn extends between the club house and the lake. To the northwest of the clubhouse is the court tennis and racquet house, also on West Lake Road. Designed by architects Warren and Wetmore, it was built between 1890 and 1900. Made of Bickley cement and supported by stone and brick arches in the basement, these courts became a model for future courts built in the United States. They have full galleries for spectators. The original glass roof with canvasses has been replaced with artificial light. Golf course The golf course does not sit near the main clubhouse facility. It is roughly away just outside the gates of the private community known as Tuxedo Park where the main club, tennis club and pool are located. The golf course is actually the third golf course of the club, as the first became the Blair estate and the second was overtaken by the New York State Thruway, forcing the move of the course to the new location near the Eagle Valley section of Tuxedo. The course existing today was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr. It is an 18-hole championship course.

WorldWide Access was the service name of the company, which was called Computing Engineers, Inc. WorldWide Access operated from 1993 until 1998, when it was acquired by Verio. At that time, WWA was located on the nineteenth floor of the Civic Opera Building at 20 N. Wacker Dr., where it had moved from the seventh floor six months earlier. Prior to its move to the Civic Opera Building, the firm's initial offices were located in Vernon Hills at the home of the Vronas and in Chicago at the home of Greg Gulik. The Vernon Hills office primarily handled customer service, sales, and new customer signup while the Chicago office was primarily responsible for technical support.  History  Computing Engineers incorporated in 1993, with David Vrona and Greg Gulik as chief officers: Vrona was the President, while Gulik was Vice-President and head of IT operations. Additionally, Kathleen Vrona headed the sales and marketing efforts. The company's first Customer Service Manager was Michael Rubin, who was followed by Sean Ware. By 1995, the company had approximately 10 employees and by 1997, it had about 25. After the acquisition by Verio in April, 1998, WWA/Verio Chicago grew to around 45 employees.  Services  WorldWide Access offered typical ISP accounts of the era, including terminal dial-up into BSD/OS UNIX shell systems, SLIP, and PPP; web hosting; UUCP and mail hosting; DNS registration and hosting; and leased- line circuits. The company also offered tech support for Macintosh computers, which was somewhat of a rarity at the time. WorldWide Access focused its sales efforts on signup up corporate clients but the company also served thousands of residential customers. The company focused heavily on customer service excellence and was considered to be one of the better ISP operations in the Chicago area. WWA was rumored to be one of the rare profitable ISPs that had been obtained by Verio during its acquisition binge of the late '90s. WWA used a take-out sashimi menu from a sushi restaurant to choose hostnames for its systems. At the time of the Verio acquisition, the menu had been nearly exhausted. = UNIX shell and dialup accounts = WWA offered shell accounts from inception, starting out as the Gagme Public Access UNIX (pubnix) system originally operated by Greg Gulik. Gagme subscriber accounts were served up on a Linux machine named gagme, while the news server was named serveme, while a third machine (whyme) was more or less the personal server for Lily Moy, the future Mrs. Greg Gulik. WWA's shell accounts landed a user on his or her \\"home\\" server, one of four BSD/OS Intel machines: sake, sashimi, miso, and shoga. As late as 1998, WWA support knew of at least one customer still using a Commodore 64 machine to dial in. Additionally, WWA offered the ubiquitous dialup SLIP/PPP service to customers. WWA was the first ISP in Chicago to offer dialup access as far out as Rockford, IL, and Milwaukee, WI, doing so by operating physical points of presence. One of the Chicago POPs was located at Marist High School. = MagicServer = WWA was one of the first ISPs in the Chicago area to capitalize on virtual web hosting, by custom-coding virtual hosting into the NCSA httpd webserver before it was a core part of the product. This service was called MagicServer (another service mark of the corporation). The MagicServer version of httpd worked around some of the problems that plagued other implementations, such as the number of open file descriptors on the system, but had issues of its own which led to its eventual abandonment in favor of the standard built-in Apache virtual hosting. MagicServer hosts originally also ran on the BSD/OS shell servers, but were relocated to Sun SPARC hosts running Solaris in 1996. These were tako and anago, and later gari and soba were added. = DNS and IRC = WWA provided DNS hosting to its customers on kani and tau. WWA was a long-time root nameserver for the *.chi.il.us domain. Additionally, tau, which had been inherited from an ISP in Rockford IL (MISHA.NET) which WWA acquired, served as irc.Chicago.il.undernet.org. Tau was one of the few machines not to carry a sushi-related hostname. = Usenet news = WWA operated one of several full Usenet feeds in the area, trading articles cooperatively with most local ISPs and other large providers such as the University of Illinois. WWA switched from local disk early on to a NetApp filer, which allowed WWA to run INN substantially more efficiently than previous. The main newsserver was kirin, and later hirame was added as a read-only newsserver. = KidCam = WorldWide Access later added Jeff Gerhardt as its Director of Business Development. Circa 1998, Gerhardt and Kathleen Vrona were later responsible for creating KidCam, which was Internet-accessible streaming video from local locations so parents could watch their kids from daycare or school remotely.  Notable challenges  =My Fone Sux = The bulk of the company's revenue was generated by the commercial accounts, but dialup accounts did comprise the majority part of WWA's actual end-users  and dialup offered easily the most problems, as during that point in time, Ameritech and MFS (later SBC and AT&T;, and WorldCom, respectively) were going through growing pains due to the exploding popularity of the Internet. Customers' dialup calls were often dropped or of such low line quality that little bandwidth could be sustained. By the spring of 1996, competition among the ILEC and CLECs was getting rough, and the phone companies began to offer virtual points of presence: they would trunk in phone lines to a central location which offered a telephone prefix which was local to various other parts of the city, which allowed customers to dial into a phone line which was in their local (untimed) calling radius without forcing the ISPs to operate remote POPs, physical offices with networking gear and modems, in various places around the city just to be able to offer customers local dialin numbers. WorldWide Access was one of the first ISPs to choose MFS for this rather than using the ILEC, Ameritech's, competing product, the Ameritech Virtual Network (AVN). MFS's virtual phone circuits were plagued with problems for at least six weeks that spring, during which time customers had extreme reliability problems. The phrase 'My Fone Sux' was coined on the local wwa.* Usenet groups. Won't Work Always was another nickname which resulted from the MFS fiasco. = The great Holio flood = One weekend in May 1997, a Civic Opera tenant on the ninth floor had some problems with a large air-conditioning unit. On the fifth floor, the plumbing into which that chiller exhausted its water clogged, and the grey water began backing up. It began flooding out onto the fifth floor, but as it could not back up as quickly as the chiller was exhausting it, the backup climbed to the sixth floor and eventually began pouring out of a sink located in a utility closet in one of WWA's two neighboring seventh-floor suites. Two WWA employees had been scheduled to perform routine off-hours maintenance on the DNS servers that Monday morning. By the time they arrived at the office around 2 o'clock AM, the hallway leading from the elevators to the office was noticeably humid, and the carpet nearest the office was actively squishing. The planned maintenance was sidelined as the two staffers began to rescue soaking boxes of paper records and computers from the office (which was nicknamed \\"the Holio\\"). Several desktop computers, which had been stashed underneath desks to release more room for already-crowded workspaces, were still running in the water  and at least one production server, a Windows NT web hosting machine, was several inches deep and still serving web pages. Meanwhile, the main WWA office, which housed the machine room, remained dry, as the plumbing to its kitchen was separate from the clogged drain line twenty yards to the east. Within hours, the hallway to the main WWA office was completely lined on both sides by piles of soaking wet stuff. It took days to get most of the water removed from the suite. Over the next few weeks, a staged evacuation from the Holio was forced as the original rock maple flooring warped  in places to heights of six- or eight-inch waves  dislodging furniture, while mold proliferated in the carpeting and carpet padding, making the office uninhabitable. WWA subsequently relocated to a new, larger suite on the nineteenth floor.

Bomar was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina, to Reverend Thomas Bomar and Elizabeth Carlton High and studied medicine in Charleston. He practiced medicine in America's first gold rush town of Dahlonega, Georgia, for a number of years until he tired of the winters in the Appalachian Mountains. He heard good things about Texas from his brother, Gen. Alexander Carlton Bomar who was serving in the Mexican–American War, and decided to move his family there. En route to Texas with his wife Sarah Elizabeth Lumpkin Haynes of Cumming, Georgia, and two children, Bomar arrived in Atlanta on April 30, 1847, fell in love with the bustling young town and settled there, running a general merchandise business on Whitehall Street. The young town soon thereafter received its first charter, and elections were held December 1847. Moses Formwalt was made mayor, Bomar its alderman, and five others were elected councilmen, all for one-year terms. The next year, Bomar was elected mayor at the age of 32, as a member of the Free and Rowdy Party. During his term he selected and purchased six acres (24,000 m²) at $75 per acre to serve as the new Oakland Cemetery. In 1849, while serving as mayor, Bomar co-founded Atlanta's first successful newspaper, the Daily Intelligencer. He never practiced medicine regularly again. When Fulton County was formed as Atlanta's new home in 1854, he became the first clerk of its Superior Court which he remained as late as 1859, when his residence was on the Marietta road a mile outside of town (roughly where Howell Mill Road splits off today). Benjamin Bomar was 44 years old at the outbreak of the American Civil War. He volunteered and served as the paymaster of Georgia's 28th Infantry, at a rank of captain. At the evacuation of the city following the Battle of Atlanta, his family refugeed to Macon, Georgia. After Lee's surrender, he rejoined the family in Atlanta; but by then his health was broken and he died less than three years later. He was buried at Oakland Cemetery.

Excerpt from a manuscript of the beguinage of Sint-Aubertus, Ghent, ca. 1840. A drawing of a Beguine from Des dodes dantz, printed in Lübeck in 1489. The Beguines and the Beghards were Christian lay religious orders that were active in Western Europe, particularly in the Low Countries, in the 13th–16th centuries. Their members lived in semi-monastic communities but did not take formal religious vows. That is, although they promised not to marry \\"as long as they lived as Beguines,\\" to quote one of the early Rules, they were free to leave at any time. Beguines were part of a larger spiritual revival movement of the 13th century that stressed imitation of Christ's life through voluntary poverty, care of the poor and sick, and religious devotion. Etymology The term \\"Beguine\\" (; ) is of uncertain origin and may have been pejorative. Scholars no longer credit the theory expounded in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911) that the name derived from Lambert le Bègue, a priest of Liège. Other theories, such as derivation from the name of St. Begga and from a purported, reconstructed Old Saxon word *beggen, \\"to beg\\" or \\"to pray\\", have also been discredited. The origin of the movement's name will continue to be as uncertain as dates for the beginning of the movement itself. There is likewise no evidence that Beguines ever formed part of the Cathar heretical groups. Encyclopedias, when they mention this latter explanation at all, tend to dismiss it.See for instance, Algemene Winkler Prins (1956) (in Dutch) which remarks that no link has been found between Beguines and the Albigensian heresy. An example of an encyclopedia that does not refer at all to a possible link with the Cathars is the Beguines (laywomen) Among Beguines who have become well-known representatives of the movement in contemporary literature are: Begijnhof (Amsterdam), Begijnhof (Breda), Begijnhof (Utrecht), Christina von Stommeln, Douceline of Digne, Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete, Marie d'Oignies, and Mechthild of Magdeburg. Modern Beguines include Marcella Pattyn, and perhaps Dorothy Day. =Communities and status= A house in Bad Cannstatt formerly used as a beguinage. It was built in 1463 and restored in 1983. At the start of the 12th century, some women in the Low Countries lived alone and devoted themselves to prayer and good works without taking vows. At first there were only a few, but in the course of the century, their numbers increased. Due to the structure of urban demographics and marriage patterns in the Low Countries, in the Middle Ages there were more women than men. These women lived in towns, where they attended to the poor. During the 13th century, some of them bought homes that neighbored each other. These small communities of women soon attracted the attention of secular and clerical authorities. Moved or inspired by the women's commitment to prayer, the sacraments, and charitable service in the world, local clergy sought to channel and deploy the women's spiritual fame in response to contemporary problems, especially the institutional church's war on heresy. Several clerics sought to promote these mulieres religiosae (or religious women) as saints after their deaths. Probably the most famous instance of this was the relationship between James of Vitry and Marie d'Oignies, who is sometimes referred to as the prototypical Beguine. Marie d'Oignies inspired James. She encouraged and improved his preaching and many of her miracles served to promote the sacramental program of Lateran IV. After Marie's death, James traveled to Rome on behalf of the \\"religious women\\" in the diocese of Liège, seeking papal permission for the women to live in common and incite one another to live good Christian lives. Beguines were not nuns, but they are sometimes conflated with nuns. Beguines took personal, informal vows of chastity. Animated by the ideals of the vita apostolica—the same ideals that led to the formation of the mendicant orders—Beguines pursued a life of contemplative prayer and active service in the world. As women, Beguines were forbidden to preach and teach, yet they actively exhorted their fellow Christians to live lives of penance, service, and prayer. Beguines were never recognized as an official, papally approved religious order. They did not follow an approved rule, they did not live in convents, and they did not give up their personal property. In fact, Beguines were free to abandon their religious vocation at any time since it was not enforced by any binding monastic vow. In many cases, the term \\"Beguine\\" referred to a woman who wore humble garb and stood apart as living a religious life above and beyond the practice of ordinary laypeople.Labels and Libels: Naming Beguines in Northern Medieval Europe (Brepols,2014) In cities such as Cambrai, Valenciennes, and Liege, local officials established formal communities for these women that became known as beguinages. Beguinages (Begijnhofs in Dutch-speaking areas) tended to be located near or within town centers and were often close to the rivers that provided water for their work in the cloth industry. While some women joined communities of like-minded lay religious women, adopting the label \\"Beguine\\" by virtue of entering a beguinage, many women lived alone or with one or two other like-minded women. Beguines engaged in a range of occupations to support themselves. Women in the Low Countries tended to work in the cities' lucrative wool industry. Parisian Beguines were important contributors to the city's burgeoning silk industry.Tanya Stabler Miller, The Beguines of Medieval Paris: Gender, Patronage, and Spiritual Authority (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014) Beguinages were not convents. There was no overarching structure such as a mother-house. Each beguinage adopted its own rule. The Bishop of Liège created a rule for Beguines in his diocese. However, every community was complete in itself and fixed its own order of living. Later, many adopted the rule of the Third Order of Saint Francis. Beguine communities varied in terms of the social status of their members; some of them only admitted ladies of high degree; others were reserved exclusively for persons in humble circumstances; others still welcomed women of every condition, and these were the most popular. Several, like the great beguinage of Ghent, had thousands of inhabitants. The Beguinage of Paris, founded before 1264, housed as many as 400 women.Tanya Stabler Miller, The Beguines of Medieval Paris: Gender, Patronage, and Spiritual Authority Douceline of Digne (c. 1215-1274) founded the Beguine movement in Marseille; her hagiography, which was composed by a member of her community, sheds light on the movement in general. This semi-monastic institution was adapted to its age and spread rapidly throughout the land. Some Beguines became known as \\"holy women\\" (mulieres sanctae), and their devotions influenced religious life within the region. Beguine religious life was part of the mysticism of that age. There was a beguinage at Mechelen as early as 1207, at Brussels in 1245, at Leuven before 1232, at Antwerp in 1234, and at Bruges in 1244. By the close of the century, most communes in the Low Countries had a beguinage; several of the great cities had two or more. = Criticism and social response = As the 13th century progressed, some Beguines came under criticism as a result of their ambiguous social and legal status. As a conscious choice to live in the world but in a way that effectively surpassed (at least in piety) or stood out from most laypeople, Beguines attracted disapprobation as much as admiration. In some regions, the term Beguine itself denoted an ostentatiously, even obnoxiously religious woman; an image that quickly led to accusations of hypocrisy (consider the Beguine known as “Constrained Abstinence” in the Roman de la Rose). Some professed religious were offended by the assuming of \\"religious\\" status without the commitment to a rule, while the laity resented the implicit disapproval of marriage and other markers of secular life. The women's legal standing in relation to ecclesiastical and lay authorities was unclear. Beguines seemed to enjoy the best of both worlds: holding on to their property and living in the world as laypeople while claiming the privileges and protections of the professed religious. On the other hand, admirers such as the secular cleric Robert de Sorbon (d. 1274) noted that Beguines exhibited far more devotion to God than even the cloistered, since they voluntarily pursued a religious life without vows and walls, surrounded by the world's temptations. The power of the Beguine label is evident in the \\"watershed\\" moments of Beguine history, from its first appearance in the sermons of James of Vitry (the Beguine movement's earliest and perhaps most famous promoter), to its reference in the trial of the doomed mystic Marguerite Porete (who was burned at the stake in Paris on charges of heresy in 1310), to its centrality in the condemnation of lay religious women at the Council of Vienne in 1311–1312.“What’s in a Name? Clerical Tanya Stabler Miller, Representations of Parisian Beguines (1200-1328).” Journal of Medieval History 33, no. 1 (2007): 60-86. = Marguerite Porete = Sometime during the early to mid-1290s, Marguerite Porete wrote a mystical book known as The Mirror of Simple Souls. Written in Old French, the book describes the annihilation of the soul, specifically its descent into a state of nothingness—of union with God without distinction. While clearly popular throughout the Middle Ages and beyond (perhaps dozens of copies circulated throughout late-medieval western Europe) the book provoked some controversy, likely because of statements such as \\"a soul annihilated in the love of the creator could, and should, grant to nature all that it desires,\\" which some took to mean that a soul can become one with God and that when in this state it can ignore moral law, as it had no need for the Church and its sacraments, or its code of virtues. This was not what Porete taught, since she explained that souls in such a state desired only good and would not be able to sin. Nevertheless, the book's teachings, for some, were too easily misconstrued, particularly by the unlearned. At issue too was the way Porete disseminated her teachings, which was evocative of actions and behaviors some clerics were—at the time—finding increasingly problematic among lay religious women. Indeed, Porete was eventually tried by the Dominican inquisitor of France and burned at the stake as a relapsed heretic in 1310. In 1311—the year after Porete's death—ecclesiastical officials made several specific connections between Porete's ideas and deeds and the Beguine status in general at the Council of Vienne. One of the council's decrees, Cum de Quibusdam, claimed that Beguines \\"dispute and preach about the highest Trinity and the divine essence and introduce opinions contrary to the catholic faith concerning the articles of the faith and the sacraments of the church.\\" = After Council and decline = After the Council of Vienne in 1312, the Beguines declined. By the 14th century, some communities were absorbed by monastic and mendicant orders. Many, however, survived the aftermath of the Vienne decrees. Most of these institutions were suppressed during the Reformation of the 16th century or during the stormy years of revolutions and social unrest of the French Revolution. A few béguinages persisted until the early 20th century in parts of Belgium, including those of Bruges, Lier, Mechelen, Leuven and Ghent, which last numbered nearly a thousand members in 1905. Béguinage of St Elisabeth, Kortrijk Surviving Beguines The community of Begijnhof, Amsterdam, credited with having considerably influenced the development of what was the city's southern edge in the late Middle Ages, survived the Protestant Reformation staunchly Catholic. Their parish church was confiscated and given over to exiled English Puritans. The last Amsterdam Beguine died in 1971, but the Begijnhof remains one of the city's best-known landmarks. Marcella Pattyn, the last traditional Beguine, died on 14 April 2013 in Kortrijk at the age of 92. Born in the Belgian Congo in 1920, she was accepted into the Holy Corner of Elizabeth of Hungary at Sint-Amandsberg, Ghent, in 1941 and moved to the Béguinage of St Elisabeth at Kortrijk in 1960, where she became one of a community of nine. Second and third waves Writer Jean Hughes Raber, a student of medieval women's movements, posited a second wave of the Beguine movement, which occurred in the 17th century, when it was supported by Archbishop Mathias Hovius. His involvement included helping improve the Great Beguines at Mechelen. Raber says there was no clear end to the Second Movement. She suggests that Catholic lay movements, such as those of Dorothy Day in the United States, the Company of St. Ursula and communities of women initiated by Francisca Hernandez, can be seen as extensions of the Beguines into the 20th century. Raber suggests the Beguines' response to social and economic forces in the 12th century offers a model that can meet current conditions: economic uncertainty or worse, single women comprising a larger section of the population, and loss of wealth in the form of deflated values of housing. She cites a California-based group, the American Beguines, as an example of the revival of the Beguine Movement, with notable but not necessarily problematic differences. In recent decades, a new Beguine movement has arisen in Germany. Recently, the Beguines of Mercy were founded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is a contemplative third order of educated Catholic women whose roots are in spiritual community. Their affiliations are good works, quiet contemplation, and living out their spiritual values. Beghards (laymen) A widespread religious revival inspired several societies for men which were kindred to the Beguines. Of these, the Beghards were the most numerous and the most important. =Membership= The Beghards were all laymen and, like the Beguines, they were not bound by vows, the rule of life which they observed was not uniform, and the members of each community were subject only to their own local superiors. They held no private property; the brethren of each cloister had a common purse, dwelt together under one roof and ate at the same board. They were for the most part men of humble origin—like weavers, dyers, and fullers—who were closely connected with the city craft-guilds. For example, no man could be admitted to the Beghards' community at Brussels unless he were a member of the Weavers' Company. The Beghards were often men to whom fortune had not been kind—men who had outlived their friends, or whose family ties had been broken by some untoward event and who, by reason of failing health or advancing years, or perhaps on account of some accident, were unable to stand alone. If \\"the medieval towns of the Netherlands found in the Beguinage a solution of their feminine question\\", the growth of the Beghard communities provided a place for the worn-out working man. The men had banded together in the first place to build up the inner man. While working out their own salvation, they remained mindful of their neighbors and, thanks to their connection with the craft-guilds, they influenced the religious life. They are credited with shaping the religious opinion of the cities and towns of the Netherlands for more than 200 years, especially for the peasant. =Relation to the Church= Religious authorities believed the Beguines had heretical tendencies and sometimes tried to bring disciplinary measures against them. The Synods of Fritzlar (1259), Mainz (1261), and Eichstätt (1282) brought measures against them and they were forbidden as \\"having no approbation\\" by the Synod of Béziers (1299). They were condemned by the Council of Vienne (1312), but this sentence was mitigated by Pope John XXII (1321), who permitted the Beguines to resume their mode of life after reform. The Beghards were more obstinate; during the 14th century, they were repeatedly condemned by the Holy See, the bishops (notably in Germany) and the Inquisition. The Catholic Encyclopedia acknowledges that men of faith and piety were found among the Beghards. In their behalf, Pope Gregory XI (1374–77) and Pope Boniface IX (1394) addressed Bulls to the bishops of Germany and the Netherlands. The doctrine of Quietism is believed to resemble the stance of these community members. =Modern decline= Before the close of the Middle Ages, Beghard communities were in decline. Their numbers diminished with the waning of the textile trade and, when that industry died, gradually dwindled away. The highest number of such medieval foundations in Flanders and Wallonia was 94, but in 1734 they had been reduced to just 34 and in 1856 to 20.

It is one of the essays he wrote while establishing the doctrine of American Transcendentalism. The lecture was read at the Masonic Temple in Boston, Massachusetts in January 1842. The work begins by contrasting materialists and idealists. Emerson laments the absence of \\"old idealists.\\" He goes on to outline the fundamental beliefs and characteristics of the New England Transcendentalists. He discusses the nature of epistemology and the debate between Locke and Kant on Imperative forms and Transcendental forms, and discusses perception and reality in a blatantly Platonic sense. He says that solitude is a state of being that should be encouraged, for it allows humanity to achieve a higher level of alignment with nature and prevents the contamination that one encounters within a society. Henry David Thoreau embodied the majority of these characteristics, except for neglecting to take action against the government. Thoreau was a staunch abolitionist; his home was a stop on the Underground Railroad. He was actively subverting the government, but Emerson admitted that there was no perfect Transcendentalist. Emerson created a perfect, ideal archetype for the Transcendentalist, but also realized that it would be adapted to fit imperfect humans in an imperfect world.

It is also used for hereditary angioedema. It is taken either by mouth or injection into a vein. Side effects are rare. Some include changes in color vision, blood clots, and allergic reactions. Greater caution is recommended in people with kidney disease. Tranexamic acid appears to be safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Tranexamic acid is in the antifibrinolytic family of medications. Tranexamic acid was first made in 1962 by Japanese researchers Shosuke and Utako Okamoto. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tranexamic acid is available as a generic medication. Medical uses A one gram vial of TXA Tranexamic acid is frequently used following major trauma. Tranexamic acid is used to prevent and treat blood loss in a variety of situations, such as dental procedures for hemophiliacs, heavy menstrual bleeding, and surgeries with high risk of blood loss. =Trauma= Tranexamic acid has been found to decrease the risk of death in people who have significant bleeding due to trauma. Its main benefit is if taken within the first three hours. It has been shown to reduce death due to any cause and death due to bleeding. Further studies are assessing the effect of tranexamic acid in isolated brain injury. Given within three hours of a head injury it also decreases the risk of death. =Vaginal bleeding= Tranexamic acid is used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. When taken by mouth it both safely and effectively treats regularly occurring heavy menstrual bleeding and improves quality of life. Another study demonstrated that the dose does not need to be adjusted in females who are between ages 12 and 16. =Child birth= Tranexamic acid is used after delivery to reduce bleeding, often with oxytocin. Death due to postpartum bleeding was reduced in women receiving tranexamic acid. =Surgery= *Tranexamic acid is used in orthopedic surgery to reduce blood loss, to the extent of reducing or altogether abolishing the need for perioperative blood collection. It is of proven value in clearing the field of surgery and reducing blood loss when given before or after surgery. Drain and number of transfusions are reduced. *In surgical corrections of craniosynostosis in children it reduces the need for blood transfusions. *In spinal surgery (e.g., scoliosis), correction with posterior spinal fusion using instrumentation, to prevent excessive blood loss. *In cardiac surgery, both with and without cardiopulmonary bypass (e.g., coronary artery bypass surgery), it is used to prevent excessive blood loss. =Dentistry= In the United States, tranexamic acid is FDA approved for short-term use in people with severe bleeding disorders who are about to have dental surgery. Tranexamic acid is used for a short period of time before and after the surgery to prevent major blood loss and decrease the need for blood transfusions. Tranexamic acid is used in dentistry in the form of a 5% mouth rinse after extractions or surgery in patients with prolonged bleeding time; e.g., from acquired or inherited disorders. =Hematology= There is not enough evidence to support the routine use of tranexamic acid to prevent bleeding in people with blood cancers. However, there are several trials that are currently assessing this use of tranexamic acid. For people with inherited bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand's disease), tranexamic acid is often given. It has also been recommended for people with acquired bleeding disorders (e.g., directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) to treat serious bleeding. =Nosebleeds= The use of tranexamic acid, applied directly to the area that is bleeding or taken by mouth, appears useful to treat nose bleeding compared to packing the nose with cotton pledgets alone. It decreases the risk of rebleeding within 10 days. =Other uses= *Tentative evidence supports the use of tranexamic acid in hemoptysis. *In hereditary angioedema *In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia - Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce frequency of epistaxis in patients suffering severe and frequent nosebleed episodes from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. *In melasma - tranexamic acid is sometimes used in skin whitening as a topical agent, injected into a lesion, or taken by mouth, both alone and as an adjunct to laser therapy; as of 2017 its safety seemed reasonable but its efficacy for this purpose was uncertain because there had been no large scale randomized controlled studies nor long term follow-up studies. *In hyphema - Tranexamic acid has been shown to be effective in reducing risk of secondary hemorrhage outcomes in people with traumatic hyphema. = Experimental uses = Tranexamic acid might alleviate neuroinflammation in some experimental settings. Tranexamic acid can be used in case of postpartum hemorrhage; it can decrease the risk of death due to bleeding by one third according to the WHO.https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/tranexamic-acid-pph-treatment/en/ Contraindications *Allergic to tranexamic acid *History of seizures *History of venous or arterial thromboembolism or active thromboembolic disease *Severe kidney impairment due to accumulation of the medication, dose adjustment is required in mild or moderate kidney impairment Adverse effects Side effects are rare. Some include changes in color vision, blood clots, and allergic reactions. Blood clots may include venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), anaphylaxis. These rare side effects were reported in post marketing experience and frequencies cannot be determined. Despite the mode of action, large studies of the use of tranexamic acid have not shown an increase in the risk of venous or arterial thrombosis. =Special populations= *Tranexamic acid is categorized as pregnancy category B. No harm has been found in animal studies. *Small amounts appears in breast milk if taken during lactation. If it is required for other reasons, breastfeeding may be continued. *In kidney impairment, tranexamic acid is not well studied. However, due to the fact that it is 95% excreted unchanged in the urine, it should be dose adjusted in patients with renal impairment. *In liver impairment, dose change is not needed as only a small amount of the drug is metabolized through the liver. Mechanism of action Tranexamic acid is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine. It serves as an antifibrinolytic by reversibly binding four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, preventing fibrin degradation and preserving the framework of fibrin's matrix structure. Tranexamic acid has roughly eight times the antifibrinolytic activity of an older analogue, ε-aminocaproic acid. Tranexamic acid also directly inhibits the activity of plasmin with weak potency (IC50 = 87 mM), and it can block the active-site of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) with high specificity (Ki = 2 mM) among all the serine proteases. Society and culture Tranexamic acid was first synthesized in 1962 by Japanese researchers Shosuke and Utako Okamoto. It has been included in the WHO list of essential medicines. =Cost= TXA is inexpensive and treatment would be considered highly cost effective in high, middle and low income countries. =Brand names= Tranexamic acid is marketed in the U.S. and Australia in tablet form as Lysteda and in Australia and Jordan it is marketed in an IV form and tablet form as Cyklokapron, in the UK as Cyclo-F and Femstrual, in Asia as Transcam, in Bangladesh as Tracid, in India as Pause, in Pakistan as Transamin, in South America as Espercil, in Japan as Nicolda, in France, Belgium and Romania as Exacyl and in Egypt as Kapron. In the Philippines, its capsule form is marketed as Hemostan and in Israel as Hexakapron. =Approval= The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tranexamic acid oral tablets (brand name Lysteda) for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding on 13 November 2009. In March 2011 the status of tranexamic acid for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding was changed in the UK, from PoM (Prescription only Medicines) to P (Pharmacy Medicines) and became available over the counter in UK pharmacies under the brand names of Cyklo-F and Femstrual, initially exclusively for Boots pharmacy, which has sparked some discussion about availability. (In parts of Europe it had then been available OTC for over a decade.) Regular liver function tests are recommended when using tranexamic acid over a long period of time.

He established Fort Selkirk, Yukon, at the juncture of the Yukon River and the Pelly River. His discoveries led to little financial gain at the time. All of the posts that he established were abandoned within a few years, largely because of to the high price of transporting trade goods from Hudson Bay, via the Methye Portage and Mackenzie River.

Such queer art practices are often by Singaporean or Singapore-based visual artists and curators who identify as LGBT+ or queer. Queer visual art is a notable countercultural facet of contemporary Singaporean society, which criminalises consensual, private sexual acts between men through the continued presence of laws such as Section 377A of the Penal Code. Practitioners in Singapore have historically contended with a host of restrictions, from the erasure of positive queer representation in local mainstream media, to operating with the risk of jail, bans, and censorship by the state, or vilification due to homophobia and transphobia from wider Singaporean society. In Singapore's contemporary art history, openly out queer artists whose art practices engage with notions of queerness have been documented since the 1980s. Queer art practices from Singapore have also been exhibited internationally, more often beyond the specific curatorial framework of a queer art exhibition. These art practices are loosely connected, and not determined by a specific medium, spanning wide-ranging forms such as performance art, installation art, video art, drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, film, and mixed media, for instance. Regulations Practitioners of the visual arts have to contend with many restrictions imposed by Singaporean law. Alongside Section 377A of the Penal Code, which continues to criminalise consensual, private sexual acts between men, strict censorship laws remain in place regarding LGBT+ representation in Singapore, among other sensitive topics. At the end of May 2005, in an amendment to the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act (Chapter 257), nine categories of arts entertainment events including \\"displays or exhibitions of art objects or paintings\\" were exempted from having to apply for a Public Entertainment Licence from the Media Development Authority (MDA). The decision was made after consultation with MDA's arts advisory groups, following the recommendations of the 2003 Censorship Review Committee appointed by the Government arts watchdog of the time, the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MITA) to exempt more arts entertainment from licensing. The 2005 exhibition at The Substation, Bao Bei, by Singaporean artist Jason Wee, which featured pixelated male genitalia, was mentioned in the press release and deemed to be \\"innocuous\\" by the state. History = Early contemporary activity (1980s to 1990s) = From the 1980s to 1990s, artists such as Jimmy Ong and Ho Soon Yeen were notable for being some of the few openly queer artists of the time, or whose practices engaged directly with notions of queerness in Singapore. Ong's work from the 1980s, for instance, would feature black-and-white charcoal drawings that depicted nude, queer male bodies in various contexts and relationships, alongside other subject matter. In 1992, as part of The Substation's New Criteria exhibition series, Ho would exhibit alongside artist Dominique Hui for We Kissed, a show that would explore notions of sexuality through drawings, collages, and three-dimensional works. One of her paintings on display was a self-portrait, titled Monkey & Thinker, now in the collection of NUS Museum and shown at their 2017 exhibition, Radio Malaya: Abridged Conversations About Art. From 20 to 28 February 1993, Singapore artist Tan Peng and US artist, John C. Goss held an exhibition entitled Flowing Forest, Burning Hearts at The Substation gallery, and Tan notably came out publicly in mainstream press as a gay man. Tan's large pastel drawings tackled topics such as HIV caregiving and police entrapment. = Brother Cane (1994) = From 26 December 1993 to 1 January 1994, the Artists' General Assembly (AGA) was held at the 5th Passage art space, an arts festival co-organised with The Artists Village. During the 12-hour AGA New Year’s Eve show from 31 December 1993 to 1 January 1994, Josef Ng staged a performance work, Brother Cane, in protest at the arrest of 12 homosexual men during anti-gay operations in 1993, whose personal details were published in local mainstream newspapers. During the final minutes of the performance, Ng turned his back to the audience and trimmed his pubic hair, a moment photographed by The New Paper. Media coverage of the performance portrayed this as an obscene act. Following the public outcry, 5th Passage was charged with breaching the conditions of its Public Entertainment License, blacklisted from funding by Singapore's National Arts Council, and evicted from its Parkway Parade site. Iris Tan, as the gallery manager of the 5th Passage art space, was prosecuted by the Singapore High Court alongside Ng. Described as one of the \\"darkest moments of Singapore’s contemporary art scene\\", the incident led to a ten-year no-funding rule for performance art, a ruling lifted only in 2003. = Activity in the 2000s = In August 2004, three LGBT+ art exhibitions were held at local galleries as part of the cultural activities surrounding Nation.04, an early LGBT+ pride event in Singapore, featuring the work of queer artists both locally and regionally. Red + White = Pink was held at Utterly Art, with participating artists including Genevieve Chua, Tania De Rozario, Jane Porter, Aidah Dolrahim, Teng Nee Cheong, Martin Loh, Desmond Sim, Ernest Chan Tuck Yew, Justin Lee, Michael Lee Hong Hwee, Han Kiang Siew, Zulharli Adnan, Brian Gothong Tan, Lim Jit Hwang, Sazeli Jalal, Jason Wee, Daniel Poh, Wong Hong Weng, Nicholas Chai and Aiman Hakim. Other exhibitions included Erotica at Art Seasons and Private Edge at B2G Gallery. In May 2005, New York-based Singaporean artist Jason Wee held an exhibition at The Substation gallery titled Bao Bei, which examined the ways through which identity was constructed in gay online personal ads, also using online self-portraits to recreate a scene from the late Singaporean playwright Kuo Pao Kun's Descendants of the Eunuch Admiral. At the prestigious 53rd Venice Biennale in 2009, Ming Wong represented Singapore at the national pavilion with Life of Imitation. The exhibition, which explored cinema history, featured video installations in which Wong cross-dressed to play various characters from world cinema, a performance that the artist views as a form of drag. The artist was awarded a Special Mention during the Biennale's Opening Ceremony, the first for a Singaporean artist at the Venice Biennale. = Activity in the 2010s = At the 3rd Singapore Biennale in 2011, Japanese- British artist Simon Fujiwara’s work, Welcome to the Hotel Munber (2010), was censored by the Singapore Art Museum (SAM), despite appropriate advisory notices put up by the museum itself as the organiser of the Biennale. The homoerotic content of the work was considered to contravene the law on pornography by the museum, and contextually relevant gay pornographic magazines were removed from the installation without prior consultation with either the artist, biennale director Matthew Ngui or curators Russell Storer and Trevor Smith. While the curatorial team and artist were informed a little later, extended discussions and negotiations took so long that the temporary closure of the work, called for by the artist, became permanent as the Biennale came to an end. In February 2012, as part of the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival, Loo Zihan staged a one-night only performance of Cane, which controversially re-enacted the significant 1994 performance art piece, Brother Cane, by Josef Ng. In December 2012, Loo organised his first solo exhibition Archiving Cane at The Substation, which consisted of an installation of 12 artefacts from Cane and Loo's artistic practice, along with a durational performance. In 2016, the queer-themed exhibition, Fault-Lines: Disparate And Desperate Intimacies, was held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore, guest curated by Singapore-based curator and writer Wong Binghao. For the exhibition, Loo Zihan presented Queer Objects: An Archive For The Future, an installation consisting of 81 objects such as perfume bottles and torch lights used at Pink Dot, the annual LGBT+ rights event in Singapore; all of which presented without context to \\"permit viewers to construct their own narratives for the objects based on their individual experiences\\". Two objects, both of which were sex toys, were later removed as the institute was concerned that they contravened Section 292 1(a) of the Penal Code, which prohibits the display of obscene materials. Other Singaporean artists in the exhibition included transgender artist Marla Bendini, known for her work exploring transgender issues. Loo Zihan would open the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2015 with With/Out, a performance installation based on The Necessary Stage's Completely With/Out Character (1999), a monologue by the late Paddy Chew, the first person in Singapore to come out as being HIV-positive. In 2015, Loo was also awarded the Young Artist Award by the National Arts Council of Singapore, and selected to exhibit for the President's Young Talents (PYT) competition at the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) the same year. IndigNation art events In August 2005, after organisers of the annual Nation party had their application to hold the event in Singapore abruptly rejected by the police, gay activists organised Singapore's first month-long gay pride celebration called IndigNation. An exhibition by openly gay artist Martin Loh opened in July 2005 at the Utterly Art exhibition space in South Bridge Road entitled Cerita Budak-Budak, meaning \\"Children's Stories\\" in Peranakan Malay. The second art exhibition of IndigNation was held from 10 August to 16 August 2005 at The Box, entitled Solitary Desire and featuring pieces by Ong Jenn Long and Steve Chua, both of whom were young artists.

It is designed by Steven Ericsson-Zenith, a researcher at Yale University, the Institute for Advanced Science & Engineering in Silicon Valley, California, the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris, and the Pierre and Marie Curie University, the science department of the Sorbonne. The book Process Interaction Models is the Ease language specification. Ease combines the process constructs of communicating sequential processes (CSP) with logically shared data structures called contexts. Contexts are parallel data types that are constructed by processes and provide a way for processes to interact. The language includes two process constructors. A cooperation includes an explicit barrier synchronization and is written: ::\\\\parallel P() \\\\parallel Q() ; If one process finishes before the other, then it will wait until the other processes are finished. A subordination creates a process that shares the contexts that are in scope when created and finishes when complete (it does not wait for other processes) and is written: ::\\\\big /\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/ P() ; Subordinate processes stop if they attempt to interact with a context that has completed because the parent process has stopped. This enables speculative processes to be created that will finish if their result is not needed. Powerful replication syntax allows multiple processes to be created. For example, ::\\\\parallel {i}\\\\; \\\\mathrm{for}\\\\; {n} : P(i) ; creates n synchronized processes each with a local constant i. Processes cannot share local variables and cooperate in the construction of shared contexts. Certain context types, called resources, ensure call-reply semantics. There are four functions upon contexts: * – copies a value from the shared context to the variable. * – copies the value of expression to the shared context. * – moves the value bound to name to the shared context. The value of name is subsequently undefined. * – moves a value from context and binds it to name. The value is removed from the context. Context types are Singletons, Bags or Streams and can be subscripted arrays. Ease has a semiotic definition. This means that it accounts for the effect the language has on the programmer and how they develop algorithms. The language was designed to ease the developing of parallel programs.

The purpose of such numbers is to be universal, short, and easy to remember. Typically they are two or three digits. Carriers refer to the shortened number sequences as abbreviated dialing codes (ADCs). Unlike SMS shortcodes, they are generally not automatically synchronized across carriers. ADCs are provisioned separately for mobile networks versus landline networks. Examples The most commonly known examples are emergency telephone numbers such as 9-9-9, 1-1-2 and 9-1-1. Other services may also be available through abbreviated dialing numbers, such as the other of the eight N11 codes of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) besides 9-1-1.https://lasvegassun.com/news/2012/sep/19/three-digit-dialing-goes-well- beyond-911/ State highway departments in recent years have used abbreviated dialing codes to allow drivers to obtain information about road conditions or to reach the state highway patrol.

Vertical service codes may also be considered as abbreviated dialing, though these are often prefixed by the special touch-tone characters * and # (or often 11 for pulse dialing) instead of using only numerals. Most are used to access calling features rather than a called party, and some are specific to each telephone company. Some are used only locally or regionally (such as *FHP (*347) to reach the Florida Highway Patrol); other codes as short as one numeral (like *1) are used to report breaking news or traffic to the newsrooms of local news radio or TV stations. A mobile dial code (MDC) is a phone number, typically preceded by a * or #, that allows the request and receipt of information directly to a mobile phone. MDC's are also known in carrier terminology as \\"abbreviated dialing codes\\" (ADC's). Mobile dial codes are dialed just like a regular telephone number. The caller can be presented with any one of a variety of responses that an advertiser defines - a voice or IVR call, a text message, a video or audio clip, a mobile coupon, game or an application. These types of dialing options can be used for a number of things. #250 (pound two-fifty) is an MDC commonly used in radio marketing. Callers are able to use #250 for a voice-activated, hands-free connection to a business. Callers are prompted to say a keyword, which corresponds to an advertiser (e.g. \\"Liberty\\" causes a connection to Liberty University). #250 is now available through Verizon, AT&T;, T-Mobile, Sprint and, more recently, U.S. Cellular.

One of the original purposes of the Ligue was to offer pre-military training, allowing members to participate in gymnastics and rifle shooting. History Ligue des Patriotes members in 1912. The league was formed with Léon Gambetta's blessing, and Gambetta's education ministry included Déroulède in its Military Education Commission, which was also formed in 1882. However, during the Boulanger Affair, Déroulède co-opted the ligue to support the general, alienating many Republican members. After Boulanger's exile in 1889, the Ligue was suppressed by the French government. Upon the discovery that Victoria, the future German Empress, had stayed in Versailles and Saint-Cloud (a town destroyed during the Franco-Prussian War) during her unofficial visit to France in 1891, the Ligue incited a public uproar. The disorder surrounding the visit eventually resulted in the Crown Princess cutting her trip short and being escorted under French military protection, for her safety, to Calais to board a ship to England. In 1898, the Ligue was revived to become involved in the Dreyfus Affair engaging in noisy and often violent anti-Semitic, right-wing protests.

Founded in 1891, it changed location several times in its early years before settling into its present campus at 601 Pico Boulevard. It is a part of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. History Postcard photo c. 1919 In 1891, the Union High School Law was passed in Santa Monica, thereby establishing a four-year high school for the city. The first graduating class graduated in 1894. The \\"new\\" campus opened in 1912 with one building, the current History Building, with an enrollment of 50 students. The school sits on the hilltop between 4th and 7th streets and Pico and Olympic Blvds., from which one can see the Pacific Ocean. Ten years later the campus was expanded with construction of the English building. In 1921, the Open Air Memorial Theater (now called the Greek Amphitheatre) was built to honor the Santa Monicans who served in World War I. One of the best examples of the classical Greek style in Southern California, the amphitheater was built after Santa Monica passed a $30,000 bond measure to fund its construction. Barnum Hall Theater, originally called \\"the Auditorium,\\" was built in 1937 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to be the Civic Auditorium of Santa Monica and host school events as well. The campus also added six buildings during this period: the Language, English, Business, History, Administration and Music Buildings. In 1952, Santa Monica High School was finally expanded to what it is now, , and two new buildings were built, the Science and Technology D.M. Buildings. As the school aged, renovations took place in Barnum Hall and the Music Building was completely rebuilt. As of February 2015, a new Science and Technology Building — known as the Innovation Building — has been constructed along with an outdoor gathering space called Centennial Plaza. On September 10, 2015, during \\"Back to School Night\\" the Innovation Building was unveiled to the public. Houses In 2003, Samohi adopted a house system, similar to college house systems; each student is part of a house.Schools Chief Pick Sees Enemy in 'Anonymity', Washington Post, 23 February 2006. There are five houses: S, M, O, H and I, with each house assigned a building or a floor of a building. S House is stationed in the Language Building, M house is on the first floor of the History Building, O house is on the second floor of the History Building, H house is stationed in the English Building, and I house is stationed in the new Innovation Building. The \\"A\\" house was cut due to the California budget cuts to public schools. A principal oversees each of the houses, along with two counselors. Teachers with classrooms in a house building/floor are automatically deemed one of the house teachers with some slight exceptions. Upon enrollment in Santa Monica High School, students are randomly assigned to a house unless the student has already had a sibling in SAMOHI. In that case, the student has the option to join the house their sibling is in, or to join a new one.

The bridge has a main span of 1,546 feet (471 m), the third longest among cable-stayed bridges in the Western Hemisphere. It was built using the design-build method and was designed by Parsons Brinckerhoff. History The first bridge to cross the lower Cooper River opened in 1929, eventually named the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge for former Charleston mayor John P. Grace, who spearheaded the project. The main span of the double cantilever truss bridge was the fifth-longest in the world at 1,050 feet (320 m) and soared 150 feet (46 m) above the river. The main span of the second cantilever was the twelfth-longest in the world. The total length of the structure was about . Following a 17-month construction at a cost of $6 million, it opened with a 3-day celebration that attracted visitors from around the globe. Engineers and critics proclaimed colorful descriptions of the unique structure, deeming it \\"the first roller-coaster bridge\\" and citing that \\"steep approaches, stupendous height, extremely narrow width, and a sharp curve at the dip conspire to excite and alarm the motorist.\\" Privately owned originally, a $1.00 toll was charged for car and driver to cross. In 1943 the state of South Carolina purchased the bridge, and the tolls were lifted in 1946. By the 1960s the Grace Memorial Bridge had become insufficient, with its two narrow 10-foot (3 m) lanes built for Ford Model As and its steep grades of up to 6 percent. Later changes to the side rail and curb reduced the lane width further. A new bridge was constructed alongside and parallel to it. Named for the then-South Carolina Highway Commissioner, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge opened in 1966 at cost of $15 million. Its three lanes, at a modern 12-foot (3.7 m) width, opened to northbound traffic while its older counterpart carried the southbound traffic into downtown Charleston. One lane was reversible on the Pearman bridge, which led to signs warning \\"Use lanes with green arrow\\" and \\"Do not use red X lane\\" on the bridge. The two truss bridges had become functionally obsolete by 1979. Extensive metal deterioration caused by the lack of maintenance shortly after Grace Bridge's tolls were removed limited the capacity of the older Grace bridge to ten ton vehicles (later five tons), and the reversible lane on the Pearman was eliminated (it had been able to switch to three lanes northbound for rush hour traffic), making that lane southbound permanently, diverting all heavy trucks, buses, and recreational vehicles to that lane on the Pearman bridge. Neither of the bridges had emergency lanes, and the Pearman bridge had no median between the northbound and southbound lanes because of its reversible lane, and it was not until 2002 when flexible barriers were added to the Pearman bridge to prevent head-on collisions. Furthermore, the vertical clearance above the river – once among the highest in the world – could no longer accommodate modern shipping vessels. Three of Charleston's four shipping terminals are situated up the Cooper and Wando Rivers, and the limited bridge clearance excluded the access of ships that would otherwise be beneficial to the economy of South Carolina. Now that the old bridges are disassembled, the world's largest modern container ships are able to access all terminals of the nation's fourth-largest container port. Construction =Funding= Arthur Ravenel Jr. Raising financial support for a new eight-lane bridge over the Cooper River was a struggle 20 years in the making, prolonged by the state's insistence that it could not afford such a bridge and by Charleston's reluctance to provide any funds for the project. Several proposals were made for a toll bridge, but the mayors of Charleston and Mount Pleasant objected. When officials revealed in 1995 that the Grace Bridge scored a 4 out of 100 for safety and integrity, retired U.S. Congressman Arthur Ravenel Jr. ran for the South Carolina Senate with a goal of solving the funding problem. He helped to establish the S.C. Infrastructure Bank and worked with local, state, and federal officials to create partnerships that helped to materialize the final funding. The State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) budgeted $325 million to accompany $96.6 million from the Federal Highway Administration. The project did not become a reality, however, until the SIB agreed to commit to a $215 million federal loan, provided that Charleston County would contribute $3 million a year for 25 years, including an 8.33% sales tax increase, to the federal loan, as well as yearly payments from the SCDOT and State Ports Authority. The overall price of the bridge totaled around $700 million. Due to his efforts in passing laws for the new bridge's funding, fellow lawmakers voted to name bridge the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge. Some felt that the bridge should not be named after Ravenel, with the head of the South Carolina infrastructure bank saying in 1999, \\"Certainly, Arthur Ravenel is a fine, decent person, but that bridge is bigger than any one individual and it should reflect all the qualities of the state and not some state senator who happens to be in the Legislature the time the structure is being built.\\" =Design= Road deck of the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge. One of the two towers. The Ravenel Bridge is a cable-stayed design with two diamond-shaped towers, each 575 feet (175 m) high. The total length of the structure is 13,200 feet (4.0 km), with the main span stretching 1,546 feet (471 m) between the towers. 128 individual cables anchored to the inside of the diamond towers suspend the deck 186 feet (57 m) above the river. The roadway consists of eight 12-foot (3.7 m) lanes, four in each direction plus a bicycle and pedestrian path, which runs along the south edge of the bridge overlooking Charleston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean. The bridge structure is designed to withstand shipping accidents and the natural disasters that have plagued Charleston's history. The span is designed to endure wind gusts in excess of 300 mph (480 km/h), far stronger than those of the worst storm in Charleston's history, Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Engineers also considered the 1886 earthquake that nearly leveled Charleston. The Ravenel Bridge is designed to withstand an earthquake of approximately 7.4 on the Richter magnitude scale without total failure. To protect the bridge from errant ships, the towers are flanked by one-acre rock islands. Ships will run aground on the islands before colliding with the towers. The bridge was designed for traffic of 100,000 vehicles per day, and forecasted to reach that number in 2030. , the bridge was carrying an average of 96,300 vehicles per day. The bridge includes a shared bicycle-pedestrian path named Wonders' Way in memory of Garrett Wonders. Wonders was a US Navy ensign stationed in Charleston and was in training for the 2004 Olympics before he died in a bicycle-vehicle collision.South Carolina General Assembly, Concurrent Resolution, June 1, 2004. The path was included in design of the new bridge because of grassroots efforts by groups such as a fifth grade class at a local elementary school.National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, Campaign Safe & Sober , December 1999. =Construction= View from atop the MUSC Parking Garage facing northeast Groundbreaking on the bridge occurred in 2001 in Mount Pleasant. The bridge was built as a design-build project, meaning that one contract was signed to both design and construct the bridge. This meant that construction could begin even while the design was not yet finalized. The bridge was built by a joint venture of two major construction firms operating under the name Palmetto Bridge Constructors. The joint venture partners were Tidewater Skanska of Norfolk, Virginia and Flatiron Constructors of Longmont, Colorado. The construction joint venture hired Parsons Brinckerhoff to complete the design. For the sake of simplifying labor and equipment resources, Palmetto Bridge Constructors actually managed the building of the bridge as five separate projects (the two highway interchanges at either end of the bridge, the two approach spans, and the cable-stayed span) going on simultaneously. By the summer of 2002 the foundations for the towers and most of the piers were in place and the rock islands were completed. The steel and concrete towers began to ascend from the islands soon after. Originally, each of the towers was to be topped with a multicolored LED \\"beacon,\\" but public opinion caused this plan to be scrapped. The fast-paced construction schedule led to contractors to use a self-climbing form system to build the towers. The formwork, supplied by PERI, provided a solution to meet the tight construction tolerances and provide safe access for workers laboring hundreds of feet in the air. The self-climbing system meant that the tower cranes did not have to spend time raising the forms after each segment of concrete hardened, and instead could be better used to haul material from barges below. The first cables were hung from the towers in 2004—as a time- saving measure, this was done before the towers were wholly completed. Sections of the deck were built outward from each of the towers as more cables were hung. Fireworks celebration to precede the opening of the new bridge, July 2005 The decks of the approaches were taking shape as well. Construction of part of the roadway actually occurred over the top of the old cantilever bridges, which remained open to traffic without interruption. A ceremony was held in March 2005, when the last slab of the deck was added, thus making the bridge \\"complete.\\" But paving, installation of lights and signs, and cleanup meant that the bridge would not open for another four months. Following a week-long celebration that included a public bridge walk, concerts, dinners, and fireworks, the bridge was dedicated and opened on July 16, 2005 – one year ahead of schedule and under budget. The bridge was featured on the TV show Extreme Engineering. =Comparison with Talmadge Memorial Bridge and Sidney Lanier Bridge= The proximity and rivalry between Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah and Brunswick often lead to comparisons between the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, the Sidney Lanier Bridge, and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, all of which carry US 17. Completed in 2005, the clearance under the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is actually only taller than both the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge. Unlike the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, however, the Ravenel Bridge has eight travel lanes; the Talmadge and the Sidney Lanier both have just four lanes. The Ravenel also features a dedicated bike/pedestrian lane. The Talmadge Memorial Bridge also has a similar design as the Alex Fraser Bridge in Vancouver, Canada.

The route starts in Mount Pleasant and finishes in downtown Charleston at Marion Square. Media appearances The cover of Darius Rucker's 2010 album Charleston, SC 1966 features a picture of Rucker, a Charleston native, with the Ravenel Bridge in the background. The 2014 television series Reckless features the bridge in its title sequence. In the video game Need for Speed Undercover a bridge similar to the Ravenel Bridge was featured but only on the PlayStation 3, Xbox and PC versions.

The company was founded in 1973. Following a 2011 merger with French loudspeaker manufacturer Focal, Naim is owned by VerVent Audio Group, a French company. History Naim began when Julian Vereker started Naim Audio Visual in 1969 and created a sound-to-light box that he hired out to film production companies. His disappointment with the sound of professional recording equipment at the time led him to design his own power amplifier. The company Naim Audio was incorporated in 1973.Price, David \\"Naim That Tume\\". Hi-Fi World Magazine. Archived from the original on 23 November 2010 Against the conventional wisdom – dating back to audio pioneer Edgar Villchur – that the loudspeakers determined the sound of a hi-fi system, and that amplifiers were simply a means to an end in moving the speakers, Vereker set about to put his ideas into practice. = Amplifiers = The first product Naim put on the market was the NAP160 power amplifier; it was soon followed by the NAC12 pre- amplifier.Everard, Andrew (6 June 2013). \\"A famous Naim for 40 years\\".

The two-channel NAP 250 amplifier, launched in 1975, is perhaps Naim Audio's most well-known analogue product, as its basic circuit layout was shared by all the company's power amplifiers until the introduction of the flagship NAP500 in 2000. The Naim NAIT, its first integrated amplifier, \\"one of the most controversial and famous integrated amps in the history of HiFi\\" has acquired a \\"legendary\\" status among integrated amplifiers. = R&D; = In 1983, Guy Lamotte was hired as a designer. He completed the development of the NA T01 and NAT101 FM tuners and piloted the development of the Hi-Cap power supply and the −5 modifications to the company's burgeoning pre-amplification (NAC42 and 32), the NAXO active crossover and the ARO uni-pivot tonearm (developed jointly with David Beck). Lamotte privately worked on a prototype electrostatic speaker design that attracted media attention. It was brought into the Naim fold in 1987, after the Linn/Naim partnership ended. Roy George, who joined in 1985 and was appointed Technical Director of Naim in 2000, is credited with designing many of Naim's iconic products.Everard, Andrew (19 April 2012). \\"Naim SuperUniti: moving all-in-one hi-fi forward\\".

[Archived] from the original on [date]. =Digital audio= During much of the 1980s, Naim asserted that Compact Disc was a far inferior medium to the vinyl gramophone record. Early discs often lost something in the transfer compared to vinyl, and Naim continued to design their products in this context. However, by 1990 technological advances allowed the production of the Naim CDS, the first CD player considered worthy of the Naim brand. The announcement in 1989 that the company was working on a CD player shocked the marketplace. The player was unusual for a two-box device in that Naim put the digital-analogue converter in the same box as the transport and audio circuitry, whilst keeping the power supply separate. The Naim CDS has since seen two major revisions (now in its CDS3 incarnation) since its launch in 1991; while subsequent lower-priced extensions to the line are often used by hi-fi reviewers as references at their respective price points. The CD555, which is the \\"money no object\\" flagship priced at £15,000, is heralded by Naim as \\"the ultimate CD player\\". Naim's Digital Audio offering was bolstered in 2017 with the internally labeled 'New Streaming Platform' that became the award-winning Uniti range of streamers, which comprised the Uniti Core, Uniti Nova, Uniti Star and Uniti Atom. The latter received an EISA award for Best All in One System, 2018–19.https://www.eisa.eu/awards/naim- audio-uniti-atom/ Partnerships Page of Naim Audio company calendar, February 1986, with image of founder Julian Vereker in a parody of a Mr Kipling advertising sloganDuring much of the 1970s and 80s, Naim adopted a symbiotic relationship with Linn Products, and their names were often mentioned in the same breath. At that time, a Linn Sondek LP12 turntable, Naim electronics and Linn loudspeakers was the preferred combination for many a serious audiophile. The two companies had almost the same sales and marketing strategy, and shared many of the same retailers/dealers. As an upstart company, Vereker, the company's founder, was active in marketing and promotion, and appeared in the company's advertising. The company's emphasis on selling products through comparative demonstrations in a single-speaker environment was a move away from marketing space of the chain electronics stores in favour of small independent retailers [in the United Kingdom]. The two companies diverged during the 1980s, at the dawn of digital audio. This was partly due to the convergence of technology, but also because Naim had significantly fewer dealers than Linn. This presented problems for Linn dealers trying to sell Linn speakers that were specifically designed to work at their best with Naim amplification. Both Naim and Linn began broadening their product ranges and started encroaching on each other's historical areas of expertise: in 1985, Linn launched its LK1/LK2 amplification combination, signalling the definitive end of the partnership. Naim began making loudspeakers and Linn expanded its range of electronic components. In 1987, Naim announced that chief designer Guy Lamotte had been working on a prototype electrostatic speaker design, and that a product launch was imminent. However, the product never saw the light of day, having been axed because of cost escalation.Christian Steingruber (October 2000). \\"History of the Naim Audio FL1\\". Hi-fi Answers (via personal website) In 1995, Naim announced the launch of the Armageddon power supply for the LP12. In 2008, Naim partnered with car manufacturer Bentley in the \\"Naim for Bentley\\" project, an optional upgrade in-car sound system that had a degree of customer acceptance that surpassed expectations of both partners. In 2010, Naim employed 140 staff, with products exported to more than 40 countries and half of its £15 million turnover coming from export. One-third of the business was from CD players. In 2011 and again in 2017, around 60 percent of sales went to export markets.  Ownership  At the time of his death, Julian Vereker held half of the share capital of the company. The other half was in the hands of employees, including Paul Stephenson who owned 20 percent.

The Washington Avenue Bridge carries County Road 122 and the METRO Green Line light rail across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis and connects the East Bank and West Bank portions of the University of Minnesota campus. The bridge has two decks, with the lower deck designated for motor vehicle traffic and light rail trains and the upper deck used for pedestrians and bicycles (lanes specifically for bikes are on the north side). It is a utilitarian structure with simple architecture, but it has cultural significance because thousands of students, faculty, staff, and visitors walk across it every day. Most users of the bridge get across it using some mode other than a personal automobile. Minnesota Department of Transportation traffic counts from 2007 show the bridge carried about 28,400 vehicles per day at that time. However, multiple counts from 2009 indicate the bridge carried a total of 71,400 people per day when other modes were also included. The greatest single mode was still motor vehicles at 37.6%, but 32.7% used bus transit, 19.9% walked, and 9.6% used bicycles, with a remaining 0.3% using other methods such as inline skating. The bridge is a cycling hot spot and, with 6,850 riders per day, may carry more bikes than any other route in Minneapolis. In 2011, as part of construction for the METRO Green Line light rail, reconfiguration of the bridge began. The original two eastbound and westbound traffic lanes were permanently reduced to one lane eastbound and one lane westbound, using the outside lanes. The two inside (center) lanes are now dedicated to light rail. The light rail line opened on June 14, 2014. History =The first bridge (1884–1965)= An iron truss bridge was first built here in 1884, slightly upstream from the current location (connecting Washington Avenue on both sides of the river). At the time of construction, many people lived in the river flats area below, a neighborhood known as Bohemian Flats (See photo below). The bridge was strengthened in 1890 to accommodate streetcars, and it made up part of the first interurban line between Minneapolis and neighboring Saint Paul (see Twin City Rapid Transit). Streetcar service ended in 1954. Construction of the current bridge began in 1962 and the 1884 bridge was torn down in 1965. Original bridge circa 1885 showing residences on the Bohemian Flats =The second bridge (1965–present)= This first structure was a straight east-west bridge carrying Washington Avenue, which continued directly into downtown. The new bridge aimed the west end slightly to the south, so Washington Avenue is now disjointed at that point. Continuing straight along the roadway will carry a vehicle into downtown along a short freeway-like section that meets 3rd Street South (a one-wayreturning involves traveling along 4th Street). The top deck on the new bridge was originally just a flat space. Traversing the bridge in the harshness of winter was very uncomfortable, so an enclosure running down the center of the pedestrian area was added by the 1970s. Originally meant to be a heated indoor pedestrian area, due to energy cost concerns, the walkway is mostly unheated. There are some heaters inside that keep the area slightly warmer than outside, and some heat loss from the steam mains, but it can still dip below the freezing point. The structure also adds a windbreak for the top level, improving conditions for people who choose to walk outside. In the summer, large overhangs also provide some shade. East entrance to the bridge, prior to the lower level reconfiguration for the METRO Green Line. At least one designer had much grander plans. Winston Close, an adviser from the university to the architectural team, envisioned modeling the top level on the Ponte Vecchio bridge in Florence, Italy. This would have included shops, making the bridge a place to stay rather than just get across. Some effort has been put into making the site a more inviting place. The addition of the upper deck enclosure led to an annual artistic event held on the first few days of classes, where organizations of all stripes can put their brushes to panels lining the interior. While most are self-promotional messages from campus groups, some of the panels always show impressive designs. The exterior of the bridge had a rather drab combination of brown and gray for most of its existence. Some felt that it was off-balance in its university surroundings, especially after the Frank Gehry-designed Weisman Art Museum went into place next to the east end in the 1990s. University President Mark Yudof led a \\"Take Pride in U\\" campaign in 1997 where the top level was painted in the school colors of maroon and gold. Later, in the first decade of the 2000s, the superstructure was also painted over the course of about two years. This had to be arranged with Hennepin County, which owns the bridge. It took a long time to repaint because the old paint contained lead and had to be carefully removed. West entrance to the bridge A darker facet of the bridge's history is its association with suicide. Poet and university professor John Berryman is the most famous person to have killed himself at the site, when he jumped from the bridge in 1972. About a half-dozen others have also died by landing in the river or on the flats area. 2008 repairs and pedestrian-level restrictions Downtown Minneapolis skyline over the bridge, seen from a vantage point near the east end In August 2008, concerns about the strength of the upper level led Hennepin County to restrict the pedestrian and bicycle traffic to a 14-foot-wide section in the center. Engineers had decided that in preparation for repairs, the weight needed to be moved to the center, where there was support from the columns below.Safety concerns prompt traffic limits on U bridge Usage of the upper deck continued to be restricted for about a year until repairs were complete. 2011–2012 upgrades for light rail The 1965 bridge was designed as a fracture-critical structure, meaning that it lacked redundancy in its design and could have collapsed if any single one of certain load-bearing members were to fail. Upgrades strengthened the bridge to help it carry the rail vehicles and added redundancy so that the failure of a single bridge member would not cause a catastrophe. The bridge was reduced to one lane in each direction in early 2011 as part of construction of the METRO Green Line and upper deck traffic has been shifted to one half of the bridge. On 16 May 2011, Washington Avenue just east of the bridge was permanently closed to personal motor vehicle traffic. The roadway was converted into an exclusive use transit mall between Pleasant and Walnut Streets, so all eastbound lower-level traffic other than buses and emergency vehicles must exit to East River Parkway/Delaware Street and the only westbound access to the bridge for most cars will be from Pleasant Street Southeast. =Roadway designations= Historically, the Washington Avenue Bridge carried U.S. Highway 12 and U.S. Highway 52, but those highways were officially rerouted along nearby Interstate 94 in the 1980s. The roadway appears to have been briefly designated as Minnesota State Highway 12. The road corridor between Interstate 35W in the west and University Avenue in the east was soon designated as Minnesota State Highway 122, but that ended in 1997 when Hennepin County took over control of the roadway from the Minnesota Department of Transportation.

She had been modelling for several years when she replaced Maarja Kivi on bass in the group in 2004, having met the other members of the group a year earlier. A key factor, allegedly, in her being selected to join the group was the similarities between her and Kivi's appearance. Kivilaan was (by several years) the youngest member of the group, and continued with her education despite Vanilla Ninja's busy schedule. When Kivilaan joined the group, Vanilla Ninja had already been chosen to represent Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. Kivilaan's arrival jeopardised Vanilla Ninja's participation in the Contest, as she was only 15 years old, and after the appearance of young participants such as 1986 winner Sandra Kim, the Eurovision had set an age requirement that all participants must be at least 16. Kivilaan initially claimed to be 17 years old, but the Swiss selectors doubted this and discovered her true age. For a while it looked like the group would have to withdraw, but the fact that Kivilaan would reach her 16th birthday four months before the Contest meant that the European Broadcasting Union allowed the girls to compete. Kivilaan would eventually leave Vanilla Ninja in December 2005, with the other three members (Lenna Kuurmaa, Katrin Siska and Piret Järvis) deciding to continue as a trio. The reasons given by the group when announcing the decision was that Kivilaan had left by \\"mutual consent\\", and that creative differences were the main reason for her leaving. During her time in the group, Triinu only played a bit part in Vanilla Ninja's songs, despite her replacing the group's original lead singer. Kivilaan mostly only provided backing vocals and basic instrumentation during live performances, and was essentially separated from the other three members during their semi-final and final performances at the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. Kivilaan also only appeared sparingly in the group's music videos, with the exception of \\"When The Indians Cry\\", in which she featured prominently. After leaving Vanilla Ninja, Triinu expressed a desire to return to the music industry once she completes her studies, as a solo artist.

A video game clone is either a video game or video game console very similar to, or heavily inspired, by a previous popular game or console. Clones are typically made to take financial advantage of the popularity of the cloned game or system, but clones may also result from earnest attempts to create homages or expand on gameplay ideas presented in the original game. Legally, video game clones are not generally considered to be copyright infringement as gameplay elements are broadly uncopyrightable, an essential factor for creative development of new games based on past ideas. More recent case law has identified that game developers can protect their games' look and feel from clones, while methods like patents, trademarks, and industry regulation also help to fend off clones. Overview Cloning a game in digital marketplaces is common. It is hard to prevent and easy to compete with existing games. Developers can copyright the graphics, title, story, and characters, but have more difficulty protecting software design and game mechanics. A patent for the mechanics is possible but expensive and time-consuming. Popular game concepts often lead to that concept becoming incorporated or expanded upon by other developers. In other cases, games may be developed with clear influence from one or more earlier games. Such derivations are not always considered clones though the term may be used to make a comparison between games. As copyright law does not protect gameplay concepts, the reuse of such ideas is generally considered acceptable. For example, Grand Theft Auto III spurred a number of games that have been called GTA clones but which are not direct copies of assets or gameplay ideas. In these cases, games that are \\"clones\\" of another are generally not implied to have committed any intellectual property infractions, and otherwise considered legally acceptable practices, although calling such games clones is generally considered derogatory. True video games clones occur when competitors, on seeing the success of a video game title, attempt to compete by creating a near-copy of the existing game with similar assets and gameplay with little additional innovation; developer Jenova Chen compared the nature of these clones similar to plagiarism in which there is little attempt to distinguish the new work from the original. Video game clones are seen by those developing them as low risk; knowing that a game or genre is popular, developing a clone of that game would appear to be a safe and quick investment, in contrast with developing a new title with unknown sales potential. Further, cloning of games from smaller developers, particularly indie developers, is more frequent as these small teams lack the financial resources to pursue legal recourse. Instead, these teams often appeal to social influence to try to have the cloner take corrective actions. History =Hardware cloning (1970s–2000s)= Cloning of video games came as early with arcade games shortly after the release of Pong by Atari, Inc. in 1972. Its success led to numerous companies buying a copy of the arcade machine to try to make their own versions. Atari's Nolan Bushnell called these vendors \\"jackals\\", but took no legal action and instead focused on making new games to try to outpace them. Bushnell also maintained contractual agreements with Bally Manufacturing and Midway Manufacturing; in the case of Midway, Atari providing Midway with a licensed Pong design that Midway released as Winner. One of those companies that had copied Pong was Allied Leisure, which had released its Paddle Battle arcade game in early 1973. When the market shifted from the two-player to four-player table tennis versions in mid-1973, Allied Leisure produced two new arcade games, Tennis Tourney and Ric-o-chet, both which Midway stated caused demand for the two-player Winner to drop dramatically. To stay competitive, Midway acquired one of Allied's games to compare the printed circuit board to that from Winner as to determine what was the new components for making it a four-player game, and added that to Winner board, and released as Winner IV. Allied Leisure filed suit against Midway claiming copyright infringement of using its printed circuit board design in making Winner IV and unfair competition, but the judge failed to agree to a preliminary injunction, ruling that while a drawing of the printed circuit board may have copyright protection, the physical board itself would not and instead would be covered by patents, which were not involved in this case. The case was settled out of court in 1974 for undisclosed terms, believed due to factors relating to a short downturn in the market, as David Braun, the CEO of Allied Leisure had said in 1974 that \\"th[e] video game is yesterday's newspaper.\\" The settlement was also likely due to pressure from the patent issues that had arose around the home versions of Pong in the first generation of consoles that were occurring simultaneously. The base ideas of a home video game console were developed by Ralph H. Baer while working at Sanders Associates, where in 1966 he began work on what ultimately became his \\"Brown Box\\" prototype. After securing approval of a proposal for his idea from his superiors, Baer worked with Sanders engineers Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch to execute its design while keeping it within a low cost target. By 1967, the optimized design was ready to be shopped to other manufacturers as Sanders was not in that market area. To protect the idea, Sanders applied for and received three patents in Baer's, Harrison's, and Rusch's names, covering their \\"television gaming apparatus\\"; this included the 1974 reissued U.S. Patent RE28,507 for a \\"television gaming apparatus\\", U.S. Patent 3,659,285 for a \\"television gaming apparatus and method\\", and U.S. Patent 3,728,480 for a \\"television gaming and training apparatus\\". Sanders eventually licensed the technology and the patents to Magnavox, which used it to make the Magnavox Odyssey, released in 1972. In 1974, Magnavox sued several companies creating and distributing table-tennis arcade games including Atari and Midway. This case was ultimately decided in Magnavox's favor in early 1977. Atari settled before the final judgement and agreed to pay Magnavox for a perpetual license to the three patents and other technology sharing agreements. However, just as with the arcade version, the home version of Pong drew a number of third-party hardware manufacturers to make Pong clones on the market, to a point where it was estimated that Atari's Pong console represented only about a third of sales of home Pong consoles. Magnavox continued to pursue action against these Pong clones using the three patents, estimated to have won over in damages from suits and settlements through the lifetime of the patents. However, threats of lawsuits did not prevent more clones of the home console systems from being built, as these dedicated consoles were relatively risk free and easy to manufacture. This led to a flooded dedicated-game console market, and creating the industry's first market crash in 1977.

A. - Overkal.jpgThe Overkal, made by Inter Electrónica S.A. in 1974, a clone of the Magnavox Odyssey for the Spanish market Eventually, home consoles switched from built-in games to cartridge- based systems within the second generation, making it more difficult to clone at the hardware level. However, off-brand manufacturers attempted to make bootleg copies of these consoles that has a similar form as the known console, but typically could only play built in games frequently on a liquid-crystal display (LCD). Other bootleg consoles would take the workings of older systems and repackage them in a newer housing that appears like the known consoles capable of playing the games from the original system. The latter was particularly true of consoles that attempted to clone the Nintendo Entertainment System (known as the Famicom system in Japan), which was not available in some countries in the Eastern European and Chinese regions, leading manufacturers within those nations to make numerous bootleg versions, knowing that it would be near-impossible for Nintendo to seek legal action against them.

Cloning of arcade games was popular during the arcade's \\"golden age\\" in the early 1980s. Arcade games, prior to mass production, were made in limited numbers for field testing in public spaces; once news got out that a new arcade game from industry leaders like Atari was out in the open, third-party competitors would be able to scope the game and rush to make a clone of the game, either as a new arcade game or for home consoles; an occurrence which happened with Missile Command in 1980. This ultimately diluted the market for new arcade games. BYTE reported in December 1981 that at least eight clones of Atari, Inc.'s arcade game Asteroids existed for personal computers. The magazine stated in December 1982 that that year \\"few games broke new ground in either design or format ... If the public really likes an idea, it is milked for all it's worth, and numerous clones of a different color soon crowd the shelves. That is, until the public stops buying or something better comes along. Companies who believe that microcomputer games are the hula hoop of the 1980s only want to play Quick Profit\\". The degree of cloning was so great that in 1981, Atari warned in full-page advertisements \\"Piracy: This Game is Over\\", stating that the company \\"will protect its rights by vigorously enforcing [its] copyrights and by taking appropriate action against unauthorized entities who reproduce or adapt substantial copies of ATARI games\\", like a home-computer clone. Third parties continued to attempt or clone concepts or ideas from popular and successful games. Games like Tetris and Breakout inspired many games that used similar core concepts but expanded beyond that; the Breakout-inspired Arkanoid itself inspired many other clones that built upon its unique additions to Breakout. Gameplay elements of Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat became common gameplay elements in the fighting game genre, A large number of games that tried to capitalize on the success of the 3D adventure game Myst were grouped as \\"Myst clones\\". Some video game genres are founded by archetypal games of which all subsequent similar games are considered derivatives; notably, early first-person shooters were often called \\"Doom clones\\",Turner, Benjamin & Bowen, Kevin, Bringin' in the DOOM Clones, GameSpy, December 11, 2003, Accessed February 19, 2009 while the success of the open-world formula in Grand Theft Auto led to the genre of GTA clones. The genre of endless runners is based on the success and simplicity of the game Canabalt. Such cloning can also cause a relatively-sudden emergence of a new genre as developers attempt to capitalize on the interest. The battle royale genre grew rapidly after the success of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite Battle Royale across 2017 and 2018, while Dota Auto Chess released in January 2019 spawned several commercial games in the auto battler genre by mid-2019. Freeciv is an open- source clone of the Civilization series. Another type of clone arose from developers in the open source and indie game venues, where the developers seek to recreate the gameplay of a popular title through reverse engineering, adding their own creative assets, and releasing the game typically for free and in homage to the original title. This allows the teams and users to expand upon original elements of the commercial game, such as software bugs that were not fixed, improving gameplay concepts, support for newer computers or console systems, or adding new ideas to the base gameplay principles, as well as enabling gameplay extensions through user-generated mods or add-ons. Some examples of these clones include Freeciv based on the Civilization series, Osu! based on Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, and Frets on Fire based on Guitar Hero. The open source nature of these clones also enable new utilities, such as developing artificial intelligence agents that have learned and improved their play in Freeciv which in turn can help advance artificial intelligence research. Such games must be careful not to use the original game's assets or could face legal issues. OpenSC2K, an open-source recreation of SimCity 2000, was shut down by Electronic Arts after it was found that OpenSC2K used assets from SimCity 2000. In the area of indie games, while there may be cloning of such games, indie developers tend to rely on an informal code of honor to shun those that do engage in cloning. New concerns related to cloned video games came with the rise of social network and mobile games, typically which were offered as freemium titles to entice new players to play. The low cost, ease and simplicity of the tools needed to develop these made cloning in that sector a significant problem. For example, Flappy Bird had been cloned dozens of times due to programming code clearinghouses offering templated code to which others could easily add their own art assets. The creators of Threes! spent 14 months developing the game and tuning its mechanics, but the first clone was released 21 days after Threes! and the original was quickly overshadowed by 2048, a clone that was developed over a weekend. In the early period of social media games around 2012, Zynga had gained a negative reputation of making copycat clones in that space. However, according to their lead gameplay designer, Brian Reynolds, that they see potential new genres and game ideas that gain popularity, and then strive to add their own innovation and concepts to at, so that \\"[their] goal is to have the highest-quality thing\\". Another major area of concern for software clones arises within China. From 2000 to 2015, the Chinese government had numerous restrictions on imports of hardware and software, and access to non-Chinese storefronts. While this allowed gaming on personal computers to flourish within China, the cost of acquiring both hardware and software was too expensive for many, leading to Chinese developers to create low-cost clones of popular Western and Japanese titles for the Chinese market, which persist today. Foreign companies are faced with difficulties in seeking legal action against the Chinese developers that have created these clones, making cloning a far less risky process. Thus, it is common for popular games from both Western and Japanese markets to see near-exact clones appear within China, often within weeks of the original game's release. A notable example is a clone of Blizzard Entertainment's Hearthstone called Sleeping Dragon: Heroes of the Three Kingdoms created by Chinese developer Unico, released within a few months of Hearthstone beta release. Blizzard was ultimately successful in suing Unico for in damages in 2014. In other cases, clones are made to address elements of the original game that are unsuitable under China's content restriction laws; for example, Tencent, which operated the publishing of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in China, was forced to pull the game due to content related to violence and terrorism, and instead replaced it with a clone, Game for Peace, which otherwise reused assets from Battlegrounds but removed blood and gore. Legal aspects Most legal considerations related to video game clones are discussed in the context of United States copyright and intellectual protection laws, which generally have equivalent features in most other regions. =United States= General concepts of copyright protection The Tetris Company won its case against Xio Interactive, on the basis that Xio's game Mino (right) copied too much of the look-and-feel of Tetris (left). In the United States, the underlying source code, and the game's artistic elements, including art, music, and dialog, can be protected by copyright law. However, gameplay elements of a video game are generally ineligible for copyright; gameplay concepts fall into the idea–expression distinction that had been codified in the Copyright Act of 1976, in that copyright cannot be used to protect ideas, but only the expression of those ideas. The United States Copyright Office specifically notes: \\"Copyright does not protect the idea for a game, its name or title, or the method or methods for playing it. Nor does copyright protect any idea, system, method, device, or trademark material involved in developing, merchandising, or playing a game. Once a game has been made public, nothing in the copyright law prevents others from developing another game based on similar principles.\\" Courts also consider scènes à faire (French for \\"scenes that must be done\\") for a particular genre as uncopyrightable; games involving vampires, for example, would be expected to have elements of the vampire drinking blood and driving a stake through the vampire's heart to kill him. It is generally recognized in the video game industry that borrowing mechanics from other games is common practice and often a boon for creating new games, and their widespread use would make them ineligible for legal copyright or patent protection. The United States passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998 as part of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Performances and Phonograms Treaty. Broadly, the DMCA prohibits hardware and software anti-circumvention tools, such as reading an encrypted optical disc. For both video game hardware manufacturers and for software developers and publishers, this helps to protect their work from being copied, disassembled, and reincorporated into a clone. However, the DMCA has been problematic for those in video game preservation that wish to store older games on more permanent and modern systems. As part of the DMCA, the Library of Congress adds various exemptions which have included the use of anti-circumvention for museum archival purposes, for example. In present-day case law driven by decisions in the United States legal system, video game copyrights come from two forms. The first is by its source code or equivalent, as determined by the 1983 decision in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp. that software code can be considered a \\"literary work\\" and thus subject to copyright protection. The second form is as an audiovisual work, as determined in the 1982 case Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman; while video games present images and sound that are not in a fixed form, the repetitive use of these in a systematic response to player's actions was sufficient for copyright protections as audiovisual works. In the case of the earlier hardware before programmable computer chips, copyright was also recognized by the impression of software based on the circuit board patterns and features that made games work as a form of fixation, as established by both Stern and the 1982 case Midway Mfg. Co. v. Dirkschneide, in which Midway successfully sued a company that was reselling repackaged versions of their arcade games Pac-Man, Galaxian and Rally-X. Up until 2012, U.S. courts were reluctant to find for copyright infringement of clones. Driving case law in the United States was principally through the case Atari, Inc. v. Amusement World, Inc. (547 F. Supp. 222, 1982). Atari had sued Amusement World claiming that its video game Meteos violated their copyright on Asteroids. The court did find twenty-two similarities between the two games, but ruled against Atari's claims, citing these elements as scènes à faire for games about shooting at asteroids. The case established that \\"look and feel\\" of a game could not easily be protected. Attorney Stephen C. McArthur, writing for Gamasutra, said that during this period, courts opted to take a more lax view to balance innovation in the industry and prevent overzealous copyright protection that could have one company claim copyright on an entire genre of games. At best, copyright holders could challenge clones by threatening cease and desist letters, or on other intellectual property rights such as trademarks. Shifts since 2012 A shift in legal options for developers to challenge clones arose from the 2012 federal New Jersey district court decision in Tetris Holding, LLC v. Xio Interactive, Inc. that ruled in favor of The Tetris Company, the licensees of the Tetris copyright, over the clone Mino, developed by Xio Interactive, which used the same gameplay as Tetris but with different art assets. The developers for Mino has cited in their defense that they only used the uncopyrightable gameplay elements of Tetris in Mino. The court ruled that copyright law was in favor of the Tetris Company's claim, as the gameplay was copied without changes, and while the art assets were new, the \\"look and feel\\" of Mino could be easily confused for that of Tetris. The court also recognized that since the time Tetris had been released and when Mino was published, there was enough new technology in graphics that Mino could have added new forms of expression to the base gameplay to better distinguish from the idea of Tetris, such as how to display the tetraminos or the animation of how they fell, but instead copied very closely what Tetris had done, thus making it more likely a copyright violation. While only a district court decision and not binding outside of New Jersey, this served as case law for other developers to fend off \\"look-and-feel\\" clones. The same reasoning was found in a similar case that was occurring nearly simultaneously with the Tetris decision, in which SpryFox LLC, the developers of the mobile game Triple Town, successfully defended their game from a clone, Yeti Town, developed by 6Waves, through court settlement after the judge gave initially rulings in favor of SpryFox. These rulings suggested that there was copyright protection on the gameplay mechanics despite drastic differences in the games' art assets, though other factors, such as prior agreements between SpryFox and 6Waves, may have also been involved. Both the Tetris and Triple Town cases have established new but limited case law on \\"look and feel\\" that can be used to challenge video game clones in court. Other methods of protection Sega patented the core gameplay mechanics of games like Crazy Taxi to prevent cloning. Patents are frequently used to protect hardware consoles from cloning. Though patents do not cover elements like the form and shape of a console, they can be used to protect the internal hardware and electronic components, as Magnavox had used at the onset of the arcade game and home console clones. Notably, many of the patents for the Famicom and NES expired in 2003 and 2005, respectively, leading to additional grey market hardware clones within a short time. However, Nintendo had built other intellectual property protection into their system, specifically the 10NES lock-out system, covered by copyright law, that would allow only authorized games to be played on their hardware. Less frequently, patents have been used to protect video game software elements. Notably, Sega had filed a 1998 United States patent for the gameplay concepts in Crazy Taxi. The company subsequently sued Fox Interactive for patent infringement over their title The Simpsons: Road Rage, citing that the latter game was developed to \\"deliberately copy and imitate\\" the Crazy Taxi game. The case was ultimately settled out of court. Another approach some companies have used to prevent clones is via trademarks as to prevent clones and knockoffs. Notably, King have gotten a United States trademark on the word \\"Candy\\" in the area of video games to protect clones and player confusion for their game Candy Crush Saga. They have also sought to block the use of the word \\"Saga\\" in the trademark filing of The Banner Saga for similar reasons, despite the games having no common elements. Within the European Union, one can register for a European Union trade mark that includes multimedia elements, which would allow a developer or publisher to trademark a specific gameplay element that is novel from past games, providing a different route for them to protect their work from cloning. For example, Rebellion Developments filed to register its \\"Kill Cam\\" mechanic as a trademark from its series Sniper Elite in October 2017, though as of February 2018, the application is still being reviewed. Other case law Other notable legal actions involving video game clones include: * Atari sought an injunction in 1982 to block the sale of K.C. Munchkin for the Phillips-Magnavox Odyssey², citing excessive similarities to its Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man. Though the court initially denied the injunction, Atari won on appeal; the court noted that though K.C. Munchkin offered different features such as moving walls and fewer dots in the maze to eat, \\"substantial parts were lifted; no plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work he did not pirate\\". * Data East sued Epyx over copyright violations from Data East's Karate Champ used in Epyx's World Karate Championship. Similar to Asteroids vs. Meteors, the court ruled in favor of Epyx, stating that while many elements were similar, they were necessary as part of karate championship-based game, and the remaining copyrightable elements were substantially different. * Capcom filed a 1994 lawsuit against Data East over their fighting game, Fighter's History, which Capcom claimed cloned characters, art assets, and move sets from Street Fighter II. The court ruled against Capcom, stating that while some elements may have been similar, no direct measure of willful copying could be found; the court further found that many of the characters in Street Fighter II were already based on public domain stereotypical fighters, and were ineligible for copyright protection. A comparison of in-game screenshots, published in EA's legal filings, of EA's The Sims Social (left) and Zynga's The Ville, demonstrating the similarities in the games' art assets. * In August 2012, Electronic Arts (EA), via its Maxis division, put forth a lawsuit against Zynga, claiming that its Facebook game, The Ville was a ripoff of EA's own Facebook game, The Sims Social. The lawsuit challenges that The Ville not only copies the gameplay mechanics of The Sims Social, but also uses art and visual interface aspects that appear to be inspired by The Sims Social. Zynga has long been criticized by the video game industry as cloning popular social and casual games from other developers, a practice common throughout the social game genre. In past cases, Zynga's clones have typically been from smaller developers without the monetary resources to pursue legal action (as in the case of Tiny Tower by NimbleBit, which Zynga has cloned in their game, Dream Heights) or that are willing to settle out of court (as in the case of Zynga's Mafia Wars, which was accused of cloning David Maestri's Mob Wars). Pundits have noted that EA, unlike these previous developers, are financially backed to see the case to completion; EA themselves have stated in the lawsuit that \\"Maxis isn’t the first studio to claim that Zynga copied its creative product. But we are the studio that has the financial and corporate resources to stand up and do something about it.\\" The two companies settled out of court on undisclosed terms in February 2013. =United Kingdom= Copyright law in the United Kingdom is set by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, but this does not specifically account for video games under any of the works eligible for copyright. Instead, video games are considered protected by copyright in their parts. The computer code or other fixed medium is considered copyrightable, and the game's presentation can be copyrighted as a literary work or dramatic work, while elements like character design, art and sound and music can also be copyrighted. Other facets, like the look and feel or game mechanics, are not considered eligible for copyrightable. =European Union= The European Union (EU) as a body of member nations sets policies for copyright and other intellectual property protections that are then to be supported by laws passed at the national levels, allowing individual nations to include additional restrictions within the EU directives. Multiple EU directives have been issued related to copyright that affect video games, but at the core, the Computer Programs Directive of 1991 provide for copyright protection of video games in their source code and all its constituent parts in its fixed format, such as on an optical disc or printed circuit. The audio, visual and other creative elements of a game themselves are not directly covered by any EU directive, but have been enshrined in national laws as a result of the Berne Convention of which the EU and its member states are part of, with video games either expressly called out as cinematographic works or more broadly under audiovisual works. At least one case at the European Court of Justice has ruled similarly to the United States that ideas like gameplay concepts cannot be copyrighted but it is their form of expression that can merit copyrightability. Patents on software and video games cannot be easily obtained in the European Union, unless it can be demonstrated that there is a significant technical effect beyond the interaction of the hardware and the software. =Japan= Japan's copyright laws are similar to the United States in that a form of artistic expression in a fixed medium is sufficient for copyright protection. Japan is also a member of the Berne convention. Video games, and computer code in general, are considered to fall under copyright as they are a \\"work of authorship\\" as \\"a production in which thoughts or emotions are expressed in a creative way and which falls in the literary, scientific, artistic or musical domain.\\" Video games being eligible for copyrights in the same manner as cinematic works were established through three cases related to video game clones from 1982 to 1984, in which Japan's courted ruled, collectively, that the act of storing data into a computer's read-only memory (ROM) constitutes copying and thus unauthorized copies can be violations of copyright, that similarly hardware circuitry can carry software information and is also copyrightable, and that video games can contain artistic expression that is protected by copyright. These cases gave video games stronger protections for copyright than before, as Japan's courts typically put more onus on plaintiffs in copyright infringement cases to demonstrate similarity, and the fair use allowances tended to be more lax. As part of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, Japan amended its copyright laws in 1999 to prohibit hardware and software anti-circumvention devices, basing its language on the United States' own DMCA. =China= China's legal framework to copyright does recognize individual elements video games as an eligible work for copyrightability with individual creative assets as being copyrightable, but does not have similar provisions as most other nations to recognize the fixed form of publication as also having copyright nor the work as a whole having copyright like a cinematographic work. These last elements have in part enabled enabled widespread copyright theft within the country, not just of video games but other works. The relatively lax copyright rules enables clones based on reskinning an existing game, replacing the art assets with new ones but otherwise not changing the game's code. China's copyright code also makes it difficult to take action on modification of copyrighted characters as these are not explicitly written into Chinese law, which has allowed widespread unlicensed use of others' intellectual property in Chinese games. Though the government has introduced more stringent copyright laws in recent years and harsher penalties for violations, video game clones still persist in China. One of the first major copyright cases over a video game in China was filed in 2007 by Nexon against Tencent, asserting that Tencent's QQ Tang had copied their Pop Tag. The court's decision in favor of Tencent fixed two concepts that remained part of case law: access to the original game, and whether there was substantial similarity in the claimed elements that violated copyright. The case also established that in considering copyrights of the individual elements, there must be a threshold of originality to be copyrightable. A second key case in 2018 occurred when Woniu Technology, the creators of Taiji Panda, sued Tianxiang Company over their mobile game Hua Qian Gu as a reskinned clone of Taija Panda. While Tianxiang attempted to argue that the overall game could not be copyrighted, the court established precedence that a video game fell into the category of cinematographic works, and that the expression of gameplay can be copyrighted, establishing this principle in case law. Industry regulation More recently, with the popularity of social and mobile game stores like Apple's App Store for iOS system and Google Play for Android-based systems, a large number of likely- infringing clones have begun appearing. While such storefronts typically include a review process before games and apps can be offered on them, these processes do not consider copyright infringement of other titles. Instead, they rely on the developer of the work that has been cloned to initiate a complaint regarding the clone, which may take time for review. The cloned apps often are purposely designed to resemble other popular apps by name or feel, luring away purchasers from the legitimate app, even after complaints have been filed. Apple has released a tool to streamline claims of app clones to a team dedicated to handle these cases, helping to bring the two parties together to try to negotiate prior to action. While Apple, Google, and Microsoft took steps to stem the mass of clones based on Swing Copters after its release, experts believe it is unlikely that these app stores will institute any type of proactive clone protection outside of clear copyright violations, and these experts stress the matter is better done by the developers and gaming community to assure the original developer is well known, protects their game assets on release, and gets the credit for the original game. Valve, which operates the Steam digital storefront for games on personal computers, also takes steps to remove games that are clearly copyright-infringing clones of other titles on the service, once notified of the issue.

California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990) the court eliminated the requirement that the discovery of evidence in plain view be inadvertent, which had led to difficulties in defining \\"inadvertent discovery.\\"Horton v. California, . See also U.S. v. Legg, 18 F.3d 240, 242 (4th Cir. 1994) (restating the Horton rules) In Horton, the Supreme Court upheld the plain view seizure of weapons related to a robbery despite the judge who authorized the warrant specifically declining the officer's request for permission to seize weapons as part of the search. Horton v. California at 130-31; Cretacci, at 183; John N. Ferdico, Henry Fradella, & Christopher Totten, Criminal Procedure for the Criminal Justice Professional 437 (2015); George, 35 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. at 492. The Horton Court also clarified that the officer must have a \\"lawful right of access\\" to the objects to seize them under the plain view doctrine. Horton, 496 U.S. at 137; Ferdico, at 177; George, 35 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. at 494. For example, an officer who sees contraband in plain view in someone's home through their window but is not authorized to enter the home cannot rely on the plain view doctrine to enter the home and seize the contraband. Limitations For the officer to legally seize the item, the officer must have probable cause to believe the item is evidence of a crime or is contraband. The police may not move objects to get a better view, and they may not be in a location unlawfully. These limitations are illustrated in Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987). First, this doctrine only eliminates the warrant requirement, not the probable cause requirement. Investigators normally must get a court-issued warrant before seizing property, by presenting enough evidence to a magistrate judge to meet the probable cause requirement. U. S. Const. amend. IV When using the plain view doctrine, investigators must still have the evidence needed to meet the probable cause requirement, they are only exempt from the step of obtaining a warrant from a judge. Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987) Second, the doctrine only authorizes seizure of contraband or evidence. It does not authorize a further search or additional investigation. Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987) Therefore, if investigators do not have enough evidence to meet the probable cause requirement, they may not even conduct a relatively nonintrusive search to get probable cause. This is the requirement that the incriminating character of the object must be immediately apparent. In Arizona v. Hicks police officers were in an apartment investigating a shooting and suspected that a record player in the apartment was stolen. The officers could not see the serial number, which was on the bottom of the record player, so they picked the player up and confirmed that it matched the serial number of a record player that had been reported stolen. However, the Supreme Court ruled that picking up the record player constituted an additional search (though a relatively nonintrusive one), because the serial number was not in plain view. This meant that the plain view doctrine didn't apply, and the officers needed a warrant. The evidence of the stolen record player could not be used against the defendant due to the exclusionary rule, which is the remedy available when evidence is obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987) This gives rise to the third requirement above: that the incriminating character of the object to be \\"immediately apparent.\\" Third, the officer must be lawfully present where they see the item. For example, an officer may not enter the suspect's home without a warrant and rely on the plain view doctrine. However, if an officer is inside a suspect's home under an unrelated warrant, he may rely on the plain view doctrine, subject to the doctrine's other requirements. In Arizona v. Hicks, the police officers were in the apartment under another exception to the warrant requirement, exigent circumstances. This qualified as a lawful entry and the plain view doctrine applied to items the officers could see in the apartment. Sub-doctrines The plain view doctrine has also been expanded to include the sub-doctrines of plain feel, plain smell, and plain hearing. These doctrines are also limited to seizing an item where its nature as contraband or evidence of a crime is \\"immediately apparent.\\" In Minnesota v. Dickerson, a police officer felt a lump in a suspect's pocket during a lawful pat down search. Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993). He did not immediately have probable cause to believe that it was contraband, but proceeded to inspect it further by squeezing it, and then had probable cause to believe that it was a piece of crack cocaine. The U.S. Supreme Court held that this additional inspection was not covered by the plain view doctrine, and the contraband could not be used against the defendant. Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993). The Court's reasoning did, however, extend the \\"plain view\\" doctrine to other senses, such as the sense of touch. Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993). Application to Technology This question typically arises where a government agent is searching under a warrant for one crime, but finds evidence of a different crime. In United States v. Wong United States v. Wong, 334 F.3d 831, 838 (9th Cir. 2003) police were searching the defendant's computer for evidence related to a murder when they discovered child pornography on the computer. Though the warrant was specific to evidence of the murder, the Ninth Circuit held that the plain view exception allowed them to seize the child pornography, as searching graphics files was valid under the warrant and the files were immediately identifiable as contraband. However, as with the application of this doctrine elsewhere, the plain view doctrine only justifies a seizure of evidence or contraband that is in plain view. It does not justify a further search. In United States v. CareyUnited States v. Carey, 172 F.3d 1268, 1273 (10th Cir. 1999) a police detective was searching a computer for evidence of drug trafficking. When he opened one .jpg file that turned out to contain child pornography, he proceeded to search for more images and found two hundred and forty four images of child pornography on the computer. The Tenth Circuit held that only the first image was covered by the plain view doctrine, and the rest of the images could not be used against the defendant in court.

Service history Exmouth became the first major British warship to be powered by gas turbine engines alone when, in 1966, she was taken in hand and was refitted with a combined gas or gas (COGOG) arrangement. The main reason behind the conversion of Exmouth was to trial the (then) new Marine Olympus which had been selected as the turbine for the Type 82 destroyer and the Type 19 high-speed anti-submarine frigate. Therefore, she was fitted with a Bristol Siddeley Olympus TM1 of 24,000 shp (limited to due to gearbox and shaft limitations) for full power and two Bristol Siddeley Proteus 10M (3,500 shp each) for fuel-efficient cruising. These engines drove the single shaft through a common gearbox. The Proteus engines could work alone or together, but could not be run together with the Olympus. As the engines could not run in reverse, a reversible-pitch propeller was installed. As the engines could be controlled directly from throttles on the bridge, bridge steering was fitted. The requisite air intakes and filters were grouped amidships and the turbine uptakes exhausted into a common, streamlined funnel, completely changing Exmouths appearance. The exhaust and intake trunking was also utilised to allow the removal of complete engines, giving a rapid 24-hour exchange time. Exmouth rejoined the fleet on 5 June 1968, and during the 1970s she carried out extended trials to validate the feasibility of all-gas turbine propulsion. The foresight of her conversion was illustrated when after only 64 hours of running, an entire ring of Olympus turbine blades failed. Her test cruises took her to the Mediterranean Sea, where she took part in various trials and exercises based at Malta. She proceeded to Crete which made her the only Type 14 to get this far east. She acted as plane guard for the aircraft carrier and was involved in the search for survivors when a Russian destroyer lost 3 men overboard when making a close pass ahead of Ark Royal whilst the latter was at flying stations (the men were never found). She eventually returned to her home base port of Chatham in Kent. She then went to the Isle of Portland as a day runner in the 2nd Frigate Squadron, providing support for ships working-up under Flag Officer Sea Training. This was to prove her propulsion in a stop/start scenario – basically press the button, start the engines and sail – which was much less time-consuming than flashing up a steam plant. The trials were ultimately successful, and allowed the trouble-free introduction of the Olympus into naval service in the Type 42 destroyer and the Type 21 and two batches of Type 22 frigates. The Olympus was also an export success, and Exmouths COGOG arrangement was also widely emulated. Exmouth was broken up in 1979.

He is one of the earliest known historical figures to self-identify as a Palestinian during his travels. Biography =Sources= Outside of his own work, there is little biographical information available about al-Maqdisi.Miquel 1993, p. 492. He is neither found in the voluminous biographies of Ibn Khallikan (d. 1282) nor were the aspects of his life mentioned in the works of his contemporaries.Al- Mukaddasi, ed. Le Strange 1886, p. iii =Early life and education= Al- Maqdisi was from Jerusalem (Bayt al-Maqdis in Arabic), from which he received his name. He was particularly fond of the city and described it at length in his geographic work. He was born in Jerusalem in ca. 946 and belonged to a middle class family whose roots in the city's environs dated from the period approximate to the 7th-century Muslim conquest.Le Strange 1890, pp. 5–6 According to historian André Miquel, al-Maqdisi \\"was very much attached to the Palestine of his birth and to the town whose name he bears\\". Al-Maqdisī or alternatively al-Muqaddasī was a nisba indicating that he was from \\"Bayt al- Maqdis\\" or \\"Bayt al-Muqaddas\\", the Muslim names for Jerusalem. His paternal grandfather, Abu Bakr al-Banna, had been responsible for the construction of Acre's maritime fortifications under orders from Ahmad ibn Tulun (r. 868–884), the autonomous Abbasid governor of Egypt and Syria. Al-Maqdisi's maternal grandfather, Abu Tayyib al-Shawwa, moved to Jerusalem from Biyar in Khurasan and was also an architect. As can be inferred by his work and social background, al-Maqdisi was likely well-educated. Miquel asserts that al- Maqdisi's use of \\"rhymed prose, even poetry\\" is indicative of a strong knowledge in Arabic grammar and literature. Likewise, his writings show that he possessed an early interest in Islamic jurisprudence, history, philology and hadith. =Pursuits in geography= Al-Maqdisi made his first Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) in 967. During this period, he became determined to devote himself to the study of geography. To acquire the necessary information, he undertook a series of journeys throughout the Islamic world,Scholten 1980, p. 1. ultimately visiting all of its lands with the exception of al-Andalus (Iberian Peninsula), Sindh and Sistan. The known dates or date ranges of al-Maqdisi's travels include his journey to Aleppo sometime between 965 and 974, his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 978, a visit to Khurasan in 984 and his stay in Shiraz in 985 when he decided to compose his material. The finished work was titled Aḥsan al-taqāsīm fi maʾarfat al-aqalīm (The Best Divisions for the Knowledge of the Provinces). Work The regions of Islam in the tenth century, based on Al-Maqdisi's work Though possibly influenced by predecessors al-Jahiz (d. 869), who introduced the \\"science of countries\\", and Ibn al-Faqih (fl. 902), al-Maqdisi \\"surpassed\\" both \\"all to the advantage of what certainly should be called a true geography\\", according to Miquel.Miquel 1993, p. 493. Moreover, Miquel surmises that al-Maqdisi \\"was probably the first to have desired and conceived\\" true geography as an \\"original science\\", an assertion that al-Maqdisi himself makes in the preface of Aḥsan al-taqāsīm. He belonged to the school known as the \\"atlas of Islam\\", inaugurated by Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (d. 934) and developed by Istakhri (d. 957) and al-Maqdisi's contemporary Ibn Hawqal (d. 978). Al-Balkhi's school almost exclusively dealt with the Islamic world, to which al-Maqdisi too devoted his studies. Al-Maqdisi refers to this world as al-mamlaka or al-Islām (the Domain of Islam), a unique concept in which all of the lands of Islam constituted a single domain. He subdivided this domain into two parts: mamlakat al-ʿArab (domain of the Arabs) and mamlakat al-ʿAjam (domain of the non-Arabs). The former consisted, from east to west, of the six provinces of Iraq, Aqur (Upper Mesopotamia), Arabia, Syria, Egypt and the Maghreb, while the latter consisted of the eight provinces of the Mashriq (Sistan, Afghanistan, Khurasan and Transoxiana), Sindh, Kirman, Fars, Khuzistan, Jibal, Daylam and Rihab (Armenia, Adharbayjan and Aran). =Description of Palestine= Aḥsan al- taqāsīm gives a systematic account of all the places and regions al-Maqdisi had visited. He devoted a section of his book to Bilad al-Sham (the Levant) with a particular focus on Palestine.Avni 1994, pp. 3–4. In contrast to travelers to Palestine, such as Arculf (c. 680s), Nasir Khusraw (c. 1040s) and others, who were pilgrims, al-Maqdisi gave detailed insights into the region's population, way of life, economy and climate. He paid special attention to Jerusalem, detailing its layout, walls, streets, markets, public structures and landmarks, particularly the Haram ash-Sharif (Temple Mount) and the latter's Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque. He described the city's people and customs, focusing on its Muslims, but also its Christian and Jewish communities, whose significant presence he lamented. Al-Maqdisi also gave extensive overviews of Ramla and Tiberias, the capitals of the Palestine and Jordan districts, respectively. To a lesser extent, he described Acre, Beisan, Bayt Jibrin, Caesarea, Amman and Aila. In his descriptions of the aforementioned cities, al-Maqdisi noted their prosperity and stability and gave a general impression of Palestine as densely populated and wealthy, with numerous localities. Guy Le Strange comments on al-Maqdisi's work: =Description of Eastern Arabia= Al-Maqdisi mentioned regions in Eastern Arabia which form parts of what are now Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman. Al- Hasa is an important oasis region in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia, whereas Tuwwam is another oasis region split between the UAE and Oman, comprising the modern settlements of Al Ain and Al-Buraimi on different sides of the Omani- UAE border. Dibba is another region split between the UAE and Oman, touching the Musandam Peninsula, which is partly ruled by the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, where the ancient settlement of Julfar is located.

At the 2006 census, its population was 227,547 in 59,388 families. Among the existing modern cities in Iran, Borujerd is one of the oldest reported at least since the 9th century. In Sassanid Empire, Borujerd was a small town and region neighboring Nahavand. Gaining more attention during Great Seljuq Empire in the 9th and 10th centuries, Borujerd stood as an industrial, commercial and strategic city in Zagros Mountains until the 20th century. In its golden ages, Borujerd was selected as the state capital of Lorestan and Khuzestan region during Qajar dynasty in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, Borujerd is the second largest city of Lorestan; hence, the major industrial, tourist and cultural center of the region. The city has kept its old architecture and lifestyle mostly through Atashkedeh آتشکده,synagogue mosques, bazaars and houses built in the Qajar era. Its people are mainly of Brojerdish descent and the second one is Lurish ( cause they migrainted to that city about 20 years ago), but there are a minority of Laks who also live in Borujrd and who are Laki speaking, like Balavand, Ghisavand, Shahivand, Bayrnavand, Ichivand, Kolivand, Jalilavand tribes who inhabit the area of Borujerd township. Geography and climate View of Takhti st, Borujerd. Borujerd city is located approximately 1670 meters above sea level and has a moderate climate with cold winters. The highest point is Garrin Mountain 3623 m above sea level and the lowest area is Gelerood River in South with 1400 m elevation. Borujerd Township has 2600 km2 area with approximately 400,000 inhabitants distributed in the city of Oshtorinan and more than 180 villages. Owing to favorable topographic and climatic conditions, the plains are devoted to cultivation of grain. Wherever irrigation is possible (by means of qanāts, wells, diversion of water of streams), cotton, melons, grapes, and fruit trees (especially almonds) are grown.Eckart Ehlers, “Borujerd”, Encyclopaedia Iranica. 1989 Borujerd is located on Silakhor Plain which is the largest agricultural land of Lorestan. The high-elevated Zagros Mountains surrounds it from South East to North West and the peaks are covered with snow most of the times. Rural people work in farms or keep their domestic animals. Other people work in governmental offices, armed forces, factories or small local businesses. The feet of Zagros Mountains is a great destination for nomads and many Lurs and Bakhtiari nomads move there in summer. The area is paved with highways and is a crossroad between Tehran and Khuzestan Province as well as Isfahan Province and Kermanshah Province. Population Borujerd City has 256,962 inhabitants (estimated for 2006) and it is the 31st largest city in Iran and the 2nd largest in Lorestan . Borujerd is the industrial point of Lorestan. Its historical and cultural background as well as its remarkable nature, has changed it to a tourist destination. The city is well-structured with live nights and many shops and markets. Borujerdi people are easy going and tolerant and different religious minorities such as Jews, Sufism and Baháʼí Faith have grown there. The city has been named as Dār-Al-Sorur which means the house of happiness. Today, Borujerd is sometimes referred to as Paris Kučulu namely the little Paris. Borujerd population was estimated about 20000 in mid-1800s. Official statistics by Borujerd population change based on national statistics. History The city of Borujerd is one of the oldest cities in Iran which has been populated at least for 20 centuries and has been reported at least from Sassanid Empire. Though founded by the Jews having taken refuge to Persia, since the Muslim conquest of Persia (637-651), Borujerd has been considered as a strategic area and especially in Seljuq dynasty and Qajar dynasty it received significant attention and many mosques, schools, bridges and castles were made or rebuilt by these dynasties. City Gate of Boroudgerd by Eugène Flandin The Borujerd area has been populated at least since 3000 BC. Medes used its pastures to produce and train thousands of horses each year. However, it owes much of its development to the Jews which came to Persia after they had got close to extinction. Sassanid Empire promoted Borujerd to a city level and built a fire-temple there. During the Muslim conquest of Persia (637-651), Borujerd castle was used by Iranian army to support the troops and the final battle occurred in Nahavand, 55 km north West of Borujerd. Yazdegerd III escaped to Borujerd castle and his army reunited again there. The Islamic Arab governor, Abudolf ibn Hamulah, rebuilt the city and constructed the Jameh Mosque of Borujerd on top of a Zoroastrian fire temple. Seljuq rulers had many travels and battles in Borujerd and Barkiyaruq the sultan of Great Seljuk from 1094-1105 died in this city. Some references mention that Zavvarian 5 km N of Borujerd City is his tomb, however according to historical books, his body was returned to Isfahan. Since approximately 1000 to 1500, Borujerd Was governed by Atabakan-e Lorestan who governed Lur-e-Kuchak. Genghis Khan and Mongols attacked the Lur-e-Kuchak and ruined Borujerd and Khorramabad. Timur attacked Borujerd two times and destroyed this city but Timurids used Borujerd Castle and Roomian Castle for military purposes. Imamzadeh Jafar Imamzadeh Ja'far Shrine Tabatabai House In Safavid era (1500-1700) Borujerd was governed as a separate state including Japlaq or Gapleh, and was neighbor of Golpayegan. Zand kings were Laks (Lurish descent) and originally from somewhere between Malayer and Borujerd. They paid attention to Borujerd for its brave soldiers (known as Silakhori) which were already used by Safavids. Several battles occurred there. In Qajar era Borujerd was a small state at first but changed to the centre of Lorestan Province and Khuzestan Province later and the city developed rapidly. The Soltani Mosque of Borujerd, the Great Bazaar of Borujerd and many schools and gardens were built and the city castle was rebuilt. Reza Shah quit insurgencies of Lorestan and established army, railway, roads, hospitals and modern schools in Borujerd. In his time, Borujerd State was eliminated and according to new political dividing, Borujerd was attached to Lorestan Province. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and during the Iran–Iraq War, Borujerd accepted many casualties and migrants from Khuzestan Province and was bombed many times. Sixty-five children were killed during bombings in an elementary school in Borujerd alone. In recent years, Borujerd has developed in population and construction and now it is struggling with social problems such as unemployment and drug abuse. 2006 Borujerd earthquake killed 66 people and injured 1400 people. It called small Paris and Solomon's city. It was a city that no people of Arabs choose that city because they are not familiar with them. Language The people of Borujerd speak mostly the Borujerdi dialect, which is a distinctive dialect on the continuum between Lori and Farsi, though to high degree affected by the specific accent common among the Jewish population of Borujerd since their escape from Mesopotamia. Other speech varieties such as Luri, Laki, and the local Judæo-Iranian dialect can be heard as well.

Life and career Rees was educated at Christ College, Brecon, Wales, and Merton College, Oxford, and after wartime service in the Royal Welch Fusiliers took his first academic position at Cardiff High School for Boys, where he was Assistant Master between 1947 and 1948. Rees then started his long career in Higher Education. In 1948, he became Lecturer in Classics at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, then senior lecturer in Greek at the University of Manchester from 1956. From there, he went to the University of Wales College, Cardiff, where he was Professor of Greek from 1958 to 1970. During that time, he was also successively Dean of Arts (1963–1965) and Dean of Students (1967–1968).

History The work was written in 1874 for violinist Pablo Sarasate, and premiered in Paris on February 7, 1875.https://cso.org/uploadedFiles/1_Tickets_and_Events/Program_Notes/ProgramNotes_Lalo_Symphonieespagnole.pdf Although called a \\"Spanish Symphony\\" (see also Sinfonia concertante), it is considered a violin concerto by musicians today. The piece has Spanish motifs throughout, and launched a period when Spanish-themed music came into vogue. (Georges Bizet's opera Carmen premiered a month after the Symphonie espagnole.) The Symphonie espagnole is one of Lalo's two most often played works, the other being his Cello Concerto in D minor. Structure The piece has five movements: A typical performance runs just over half an hour. One of the shorter recordings, conductor Eugene Ormandy's 1967 recording with the Philadelphia Orchestra, featuring violinist Isaac Stern, runs 32 minutes and 43 seconds. It was common practice until the middle of the 20th century for performances of the work to omit the Intermezzo, leaving a four-movement work that more closely reflected the traditional structure of a symphony. Influence on Tchaikovsky The Symphonie espagnole had some influence on the genesis of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D major. In March 1878, Tchaikovsky was staying at Nadezhda von Meck's estate at Clarens, Switzerland, while recovering from the breakdown of his disastrous marriage and his subsequent suicide attempt. His favourite pupil (and allegedly his lover), the violinist Iosif Kotek, shortly arrived from Berlin with a lot of new music for violin. His collection included the Symphonie espagnole, which he and Tchaikovsky played through to great delight. This gave Tchaikovsky the idea of writing a violin concerto, and he immediately set aside his current work on a piano sonata and started on the concerto on 17 March.Detroit Symphony Orchestra With Kotek's technical help, the concerto was finished by 11 April.

The best remaining record of the battle is from Jean Froissart's Chronicles in which he claims to have interviewed veterans from both sides of the battle. His account is still regarded with some concern as details, such as the distance between Newcastle upon Tyne and Otterburn, are incorrect. The Scottish noble James, 2nd Earl of Douglas decided to lead a raidone of a continuing series on both sides of the borderinto English territory. It was timed to take advantage of divisions on the English side between Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland who had just taken over defence of the border. The battle The Scots divided their forces, with the main force and their baggage train heading towards Carlisle, while a raiding party under the Earl of Douglas ravaged the countryside around Durham and Newcastle. Northumberland sent his two sons Harry Hotspur and Sir Ralph Percy to engage while he stayed at Alnwick to cut off the marauders' retreat. Froissart says that the first fighting included a meeting of the Earl of Douglas and Henry Percy in hand-to- hand combat, in which Percy's pennon was captured. Douglas then moved off destroying the castle at Ponteland and besieging Otterburn Castle (now Otterburn Tower). Percy attacked Douglas's encampment with a surprise attack in the late afternoon, but first encountered the Earl's serving men, giving the bulk of the forces time to muster and attack them on their flank. Douglas led the left wing, while John Dunbar, Earl of Moray led the right. Hotspur's men, having ridden up from Newcastle, were tired and disorganized as they made their way onto the field. Hotspur was so overly confident that he attacked the Scots while the rest of his force was still marching up through Otterburn. During the battle on a moonlit night Douglas was killed; his death had no influence on the outcome of the battle and went unnoticed until much later. The Percys were both captured. Sir John Montgomery, 7th of Eaglesham captured Henry Percy (later using the ransom to build Polnoon Castle) with the remaining English force retreating to Newcastle. Despite Percy's force having an estimated three to one advantage over the Scots, Froissart records 1,040 English were captured and 1,860 killed whereas 200 Scots were captured and 100 were killed. The Westminster Chronicle estimates Scottish casualties at around 500. When the Bishop of Durham advanced from Newcastle with 10,000 men he was so impressed by the ordered appearance of the Scottish force, the din they set up with their horns, and their seemingly unassailable position, that he declined to attack. Some have suggested that Hotspur's rashness and eagerness to engage the Scots and the added tiredness of the English army after its long march north, were without doubt, the reasons for English defeat, despite having a three to one advantage in numbers. It is possible that the reasons for this defeat may be more complex, however. Aftermath Such a decisive victory kept the two sides apart for some time. Of such renown was the battle of Otterburn that several ballads were composed in its honour including The Battle of Otterburn and The Ballad of Chevy Chase (Child ballads 161 and 162). Chevy Chase rather mangles the history of the battle and may be confusing other conflicts at around the same time but it is still cited as one of the best of the ancient ballads. Houses involved in the battle Some of the various Scottish Lowland families involved in this battle were the Clan Hall Swintons, Johnstones, Grahams, Gordons, Lindsays, Leslies, Herons, and Montgomerys.Vincent Stuckey Lean, Lean's Collection, p. 266 References =Notes= =Sources= ;Primary * Froissart, Jean, Chronicles, 1903 ed. * Hardyng, John, Chronicles, 1812. * Pluscarden, the Book of, ed.

The rotation is in addition to the forward or backward acceleration. Knowing of and understanding propeller walk is important when maneuvering in small spaces. It can be used to one's advantage while mooring off, or it can complicate a maneuver if the effect works against the pilot.  Effect  Axial and radial movement of propeller waterRadial movement of propeller water A propeller is called right-handed if it rotates clockwise in forward gear (when viewed from the stern). A right-handed propeller in forward gear will tend to push the stern of the boat to starboard (thereby pushing the bow to port and turning the boat counter-clockwise) unless the rotation is corrected for. In reverse gear, the turning effect will be much stronger and with opposite direction (pushing the aft to port). A left-handed propeller acts analogically to the right-handed but with all rotation directions reversed.  Cause  Propeller walk is caused by the water, moved by the propeller in an axial direction and in a rotation. The water, coming from the propeller, gets a cone shape, widening when it leaves the propeller. If the rotating water cone contacts the ship's hull, a sideways force is generated. Propeller walk is hardly noticeable when sailing forward, since the propeller water will not hit a large surface of the ship's hull and corrections to the ship's course can easily be made with the rudder. When in reverse gear, the water will hit the hull directly, resulting in propeller walk.

The term is used to describe Bengalis from the east, who are marked by a distinct accent. . It is usually assumed that the Bramhaputra-Padma river system is the demarcation line between the Western and Eastern wings of the Bengal region. The areas to the East of the Bramhaputra-Padma river system are traditionally held to be the homeland of the Bangal people. However, some commentators claim that the areas of Sylhet division and Chattagram division should not be included as Bangal area but treated as distinct regions- harboring the Sylheti and Chatgaian people respectively. Going by the more strict definition, the Bangals are those people whose ancestry is connected to the Eastern Bengal plains of Mymensingh, Dhaka, and Comilla. Further, some opinions exist that among the East Bengal Plains origin people, only people belonging to the more affluent economic groups should be classified as Bangal. Going by this opinion, the designation Bangal has an ethno-geographic as well as a social connotation. Some of the people from East Bengal, mainly Hindus, migrated to West Bengal during the Partition of India in 1947. These refugees were sometimes referred to as Bangals by the native population of West Bengal. . As such, the terms Ghoti and Bangal are mostly used in West Bengal while in Bangladesh, the usage of these is rare except in regions with relatively high concentrations of immigrants from West Bengal. In modern times, amongst the high-caste Bengali Hindus, \\"Bangal\\" and \\"Ghoti\\" are used as social sub-groups. Those whose families came from East Bengal at the time of Partition are Bangals and those whose families were staying in West Bengal at that time are Ghotis. Similarly, the people who came to West Bengal from East Bengal before the Independence of India in1947 are also known as Ghotis as they were staying in West Bengal, India, at the time of Independence. The term as used here has little relation to actual geography since most members of these groups all now live in India. Historically, in addition to marrying within their castes, people from these groups also preferred to marry within the group, whether Bangal or Ghoti. . Bangals and Ghotis keep up their cultural rivalry through their respective support of the football clubs East Bengal (Bangals) and Mohun Bagan (Ghotis). They also cherish a rivalry through a claim of the supremacy of their respective cuisines and especially river-food delicacies, i. e., Chingri (prawn) for Ghotis and Ilish (hilsa) for Bangals.

Etymology Among the Bengalis of India, the terms \\"Ghoti\\" and \\"Bangal\\" are used as social sub- groups indicating the ancestral origin of a family. The term \\"Ghoti\\" has been known to be used since at least the early-18th century. While all Ghotis are ethno-linguistically Bengali, the term does not refer to a single community of people, and was initially not bound by religion. Instead, it is geographic in nature, loosely referring to all Bengali-speaking inhabitants of the western parts of the historic region of Bengal. In history and popular culture, Western Bengal includes the land west of the Padma river (the tributary of the Ganges that flows eastwards), such as Jessore District and Khulna District in Bangladesh and almost the entirety of the state of West Bengal in India. Jessore and Khulna were Hindu-majority districts that were included in Pakistan during the partition of Bengal, while Muslim-majority Murshidabad was included in India to resolve border contiguity issues. History The usage of the term shot up since 1947 when India got its independence and the region of Bengal was bifurcated. The western half of Bengal, historic homeland of the Ghoti people, became the state of West Bengal, while the eastern half (Purbo Banga) became East Pakistan. In 1971, East Pakistan became the nation of Bangladesh after the Liberation of Bangladesh. During both events, as well as before and after them, millions of Hindu Bangals fled from East Pakistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution and political repression by the majority Muslim populace. These Bangal refugees competed for housing, food and employment as population density in West Bengal soared. The term \\"Ghoti\\" was popularised by these refugees to identify the native population as well as the associated native culture, facets of which was significantly different from that in eastern Bengal. Subsequently, the native population, which was economically better placed and controlled the majority of the land and job resources, internalized the term. This arose from their desire and need to socially distinguish themselves from the newcomers, who were discriminated upon. Another result of these massive religious migrations of the 20th century, necessitated by religious persecution on both sides of the border, have been the complete erasing of the \\"Muslim Ghoti\\". Some Bengali Muslims living in the Western parts of the region, left India for Bangladesh. After Bangladesh's independence, its founders espoused the national cultural identity of the country to be singularly bengali, without regional cultural allegiances. So, few Bangladeshi Muslims identify with their cultural Ghoti roots while those in West Bengal identify as either simply Muslims and/or Bengalis, culturally. =1980s onwards= The terms \\"Ghoti\\" or \\"Bangal\\" now has little relation to actual geography, since most members of both groups live in India, mostly in West Bengal. The term is used freely and not considered derogatory within this social class now. The intrinsic differences between Ghotis and Bangals, and their rivalries are now part of the larger Culture of West Bengal. Millions of Bengalis in modern-day India, now have both Ghoti and Bangal heritage, with a high rate of intermarriage between the communities over the preceding four decades. Culture The dialects, folk traditions (Lokachaar) and cuisine of Ghotis are distinct from those of the Purbabangiyas or the natives of erstwhile eastern Bengal. Initially, there was a protracted period of cultural and sociological clash between the native population and the refugees. Ghotis are frequently distinguished by their Bangla accent and use of certain local dialects and figures of speech that Bangals, in general, would not use. =Religious practices= The religious practices of Ghoti families differ significantly from other hindu families in the rest of the state. Ghotis perform Lakshmi puja (mostly only at home) on the day of Kali Puja. On the other hand, Bangals celebrate Lakshmi puja on the fifth day after Durga Puja. =Cuisine= Sweets are a major part of Ghoti cuisine, as is the case for the entire Bengal region. Sweets such as Sponge Rosogolla (Rasgulla), Misti doi, Ledikeni, Langcha, Jaynagarer Moa, Roshomalai, Pantua, JolBhora Talsash, Mihidana, Roshokadamba, Rajbhog and Gopalbhog, among others, are known to originate in Western Bengal and are a staple of Ghoti culture. In terms of seafood, an important element of Bengali cuisine, Ghoti people are generally more associated with (Prawns), locally called 'Chingri', used to make a broad variety of Chingri malai curry. As compared to this, Bangals share a love for Hilsa fish, (popularly known as 'Ilish' in West Bengal). Ghotis are also known for including a wide number of dishes with 'Posto'(Poppy seed) in their cuisine. =Sports= Mohun Bagan vs East Bengal : Traditionally, West Bengal has been a major centre for football and a longstanding rivalry between Ghoti and Bangal people on the football field have been a hallmark of the larger social friction between the groups. Ghoti people have historically supported the Mohun Bagan AC whereas the Bangals are traditionally supporters of East Bengal Club. Though there are several exceptions, both communities in general have supported their respective teams since the 1950s. A popular culture mainstay in Kolkata, this deep rivalry has often resulted in violent clashes during matches, in the presence of thousands of fans. In a typical season, the clubs currently meet at least 3 times a year; twice in the I-League and once in the Calcutta Football League. The ultimate showdown between the teams takes place during the annual Kolkata Derby, which features in FIFA's classic derby list. The primary venue of the match - the 85,000-seat Salt Lake Stadium - has remained soldout on match day, for decades. The Kolkata Police Force has in recent years maintained strict supervision after riots between fans claimed lives on multiple occasions. Often the clubs also meet in other competitions like the Federation Cup (India), the IFA Shield, and the Durand Cup, among others.

For example, moving up from 40% to 44% is a 4 percentage point increase, but is a 10 percent increase in what is being measured. In the literature, the percentage point unit is usually either written out, or abbreviated as pp or p.p. to avoid ambiguity. After the first occurrence, some writers abbreviate by using just \\"point\\" or \\"points\\". Consider the following hypothetical example: In 1980, 50 percent of the population smoked, and in 1990 only 40 percent smoked. One can thus say that from 1980 to 1990, the prevalence of smoking decreased by 10 percentage points although smoking did not decrease by 10 percent (it decreased by 20 percent) – percentages indicate ratios, not differences. Percentage-point differences are one way to express a risk or probability. Consider a drug that cures a given disease in 70 percent of all cases, while without the drug, the disease heals spontaneously in only 50 percent of cases. The drug reduces absolute risk by 20 percentage points. Alternatives may be more meaningful to consumers of statistics, such as the reciprocal, also known as the number needed to treat (NNT). In this case, the reciprocal transform of the percentage-point difference would be 1/(20pp) = 1/0.20 = 5. Thus if 5 patients are treated with the drug, one could expect to heal one more case of the disease than would have occurred in the absence of the drug. For measurements involving percentages as a unit, such as, growth, yield, or ejection fraction, statistical deviations and related descriptive statistics, including the standard deviation and root-mean-square error, the result should be expressed in units of percentage points instead of percentage. Mistakenly using percentage as the unit for the standard deviation is confusing, since percentage is also used as a unit for the relative standard deviation, i.e. standard deviation divided by average value (coefficient of variation).

McCourt also wrote two memoirs titled, respectively, A Monk Swimming and Singing My Him Song, detailing his life in Ireland and later return to the United States where he operated a successful Manhattan tavern frequented by entertainment celebrities. He also authored a book on the history of the ballad Danny Boy. He also put together a collection of Irish writings, called 'Voices of Ireland'. Politics On Tuesday, 18 April 2006, McCourt announced that he would seek to become governor of New York in the November 2006 election as a Green Party candidate. Running under the slogan \\"Don't waste your vote, give it to me\\", McCourt promised to recall the New York National Guard from Iraq, to make public education free through college, and to institute a statewide comprehensive \\"sickness care\\" system. McCourt polled at 5% in a 10 October Zogby poll, versus 25% for Republican John Faso and 63% for Democrat Eliot Spitzer. McCourt was endorsed by Cindy Sheehan, mother of a fallen soldier in the Iraq War.http://gpnys.dreamhosters.com/?p=312 The League of Women Voters excluded him from the gubernatorial debate. He came in a distant third in the general election, received 40,729 votes (or just under 1%), 9,271 votes short of what was required to gain automatic access in the 2010 election.

A Monk Swimming A Monk Swimming (1998) is a memoir by Malachy McCourt of his life in Limerick, Ireland, and of his experiences when he came to America. The book recounts the journey and the many obstacles that McCourt had to overcome. After first working as a longshoreman, he was able to open a successful Manhattan tavern frequented by entertainment celebrities, and appeared on television talk shows, although neglecting his wife and child. This memoir picks up roughly where Frank McCourt, the author's older brother, left off at the end of his Pulitzer Prize–winning Angela's Ashes. This book was written and published before the elder McCourt published his own sequels, 'Tis and Teacher Man. Malachy McCourt's account of his early years in New York City and its surrounding areas lends a different, if not altogether more brusque, account of the McCourt Brothers respective returns to their native United States. Some notable sections include: * A chance meeting with Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at a football club reception for the couple. * A \\"summer of content\\" spent living, drinking, and carrying on with married women in Ocean Bay Park, Fire Island at night while by days selling The Bible door-to-door across the Great South Bay in Bay Shore, Long Island. * The description of the Ancient Order of Hibernians as \\"Ireland's most mediocre sons\\" (paraphrase). This seems to be tied to their banning of homosexual groups from marching in the New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade. The title is a mondegreen of \\"amongst women\\", a phrase from the Catholic rosary prayer, Hail Mary. The book is dedicated to New York City politician, humanitarian, and fellow Irishman Paul O'Dwyer, who at the time of first publication had recently died. McCourt and O'Dwyer had been close friends and politically like-minded.

He is more usually known as J. Edward Oliver (or JEO, or Jack). Biography JEO achieved fame in the 1970s with a long-running strip in the UK music paper Disc (and Music Echo), later Record Mirror. The strip had many fans including John Lennon. It included characters from TV, film and music, with a large section for readers' contributions (Win a Plastic Warthog). Jack provided other material, including a pop-based strip called The Nose, stories and numerous graphics. One character proved particularly enduring, a dinosaur called Fresco-Le-Raye. Up to his death, J Edward Oliver continued to create Fresco strips which can be seen on his official website. (The site also features other strips, such as The Invisible Man, a staple of his Record Mirror years.) Other work at that time included promotional art for a single by Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs and UK records. In November 1977, the Record Mirror strip was deemed not contemporary enough and was ended. Oliver went to work for IPC Magazines Ltd, creating comic strips including Buster's Master Mind (1980-1983), Cliff Hanger (1983-1987) and Vid Kid, as well as drawing The Champ in Whizzer and Chips from 1979 to 1981. Many of his strips included puzzles and games. In 1984, Oliver also wrote the words for a musical called Swan Esther which was performed at London's Young Vic and on BBC radio. When Buster ceased publication at the beginning of 2000, Oliver was the last artist left, and drew the only non-reprint material in the comic's final issue (\\"How It All Ends\\", which looked back at how all the Buster characters ended). With Buster gone, Oliver investigated other work, including newspaper strips and first day covers. In 2000, together with his cousin Steve, he created Phil Stamp Covers, unique first day covers for stamp collectors. Among Oliver's trademarks in his strips were little signs reading \\"Abolish Tuesdays\\" and regular sightings of a tiny cube with a crank handle attached. The latter was never explained. Oliver also had something of an obsession with the British actress Madeline Smith, drawing several appearances by her into his work, which she later complained about. Oliver reacted characteristically, producing a strip about her complaint. In 2000, a website about Oliver's work revived interest in it. The site was originally created as a celebration of JEO's work in Disc and Record Mirror but later JEO contributed new material, as well as obscure historical stuff and a new, e-mailed (and free) weekly strip involving Fresco-Le-Raye, which eventually had hundreds of subscribers and ran for several hundred episodes. In 2007 Oliver announced he was suffering from cancer, but he continued to create new material. In March 2007 he married his girlfriend of many years, Liz Hales. He died peacefully on 26 May 2007. JEO's website continues, with much unpublished material finally seeing the light of day. = Archaeological find = A rare collection of early Middle Bronze Age (c. 13th century B.) tools and weapons was discovered by Oliver's father John whilst digging the footings of an extension to his home in Dartford, in 1986. The four implements comprised two axe-heads, a knife and a tanged shaving razor and are known as the Leyton Cross Bronzes. The items were purchased by and are on display in Dartford Museum.

Aḥmad b. Muḥammad (, Ibn Qudāmah; 1147 - 7 July 1223), often referred to as Ibn Qudamah or Ibn Qudama for short, was a Sunni Muslim ascetic, jurisconsult, traditionalist theologian, and Sufi mystic. Having authored many important treatises on Islamic jurisprudence and religious doctrine, including one of the standard works of Hanbali law, the revered al-Mug̲h̲nī, Ibn Qudamah is highly regarded in Sunnism for being one of the most notable and influential thinkers of the Hanbali school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence. Within that school, he is one of the few thinkers to be given the honorific epithet of Shaykh of Islam, which is a prestigious title bestowed by Sunnis on some of the most important thinkers of their tradition. A proponent of the classical Sunni position of the \\"differences between the scholars being a mercy,\\" Ibn Qudamah is famous for having said: \\"The consensus of the Imams of jurisprudence is an overwhelming proof and their disagreement is a vast mercy.\\"Ibn Qudamah, Lam‘at al-I‘tiqad, trans. G. F. Haddad Life An 1876 wood-engraving of the market-places of Baghdad by John Philip Newman; Ibn Qudamah visited this city three times in his life, having studied and taught in many of its most prominent areas in 1166, 1189, and 1196 Ibn Qudamah was born in Palestine in Jammain, a town near Jerusalem (Bayt al-Maqdīs in the Arabic vernacular, whence his extended name), in 1147 to the revered Hanbali preacher and mystic Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Qudāmah (d. 1162), \\"a man known for his asceticism\\" and in whose honor \\"a mosque was [later] built in Damascus.\\"Nuʿaymī, Dāris, ii, 354 Having received the first phase of his education in Damascus, where he studied the Quran and the hadith extensively, Ibn Qudamah made his first trip to Baghdad in 1166, in order to study law and Sufi mysticism under the tutelage of the renowned Hanbali mystic and jurist Abdul-Qadir Gilani (d. ca. 1167), who would go on to become one of the most widely venerated saints in all of Sunni Islam. Although Ibn Qudamah's \\"discipleship was cut short by the latter’s death ... [the] experience [of studying under Abdul-Qadir Gilani] ... had its influence on the young\\" scholar, \\"who was to reserve a special place in his heart for mystics and mysticism\\" for the rest of his life. Ibn Qudamah's first stay in Baghdad lasted four years, during which time he is also said to have written an important work criticizing what he deemed to be the excessive rationalism of Ibn Aqil (d. 1119), entitled Taḥrīm al-naẓar fī kutub ahl al-kalām (The Censure of Rationalistic Theology). During this sojourn in Baghdad, Ibn Qudamah studied hadith under numerous teachers, including three female hadith masters, namely Khadīja al-Nahrawāniyya (d. 1175), Nafīsa al-Bazzāza (d. 1168), and Shuhda al-Kātiba (d. ca. 1175).Asma Sayeed, Women and Transmission of Religious Knowledge in Islam (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 170 In turn, all these various teachers gave Ibn Qudamah the permission to begin teaching the principles of hadith to his own students, including important female disciples such as Zaynab bint al-Wāsiṭī (d. ca. 1240). Ibn Qudamah fought in Saladins Army during the battle to recapture Jerusalem in 1187. He visited Baghdad again in 1189 and 1196, making his pilgrimage to Mecca the previous year in 1195, before finally settling down in Damascus in 1197, Ibn Qudamah died on Saturday, the Day of Eid al-Fitr, on July 7, 1223. Views =God= In theological creed, Ibn Qudamah was one of the primary proponents of the Athari school of Sunni theology,Muwaffaq al-Dīn Ibn Qudāma al-Maqdisi, Ta!hrīm al-na)zar fī kutub al-kalām, ed. Abd al-Ra!hmān b. Mu!hammad Saīd Dimashqiyya (Riyadh: Dār ālam al-kutub, 1990); translated into English by George Makdisi, Ibn Qudāma’s Censure of Speculative Theology (London: Luzac, 1962) which held that overt theological speculation was spiritually detrimental and supported drawing theology exclusively from the two sources of the Quran and the hadith. Regarding theology, Ibn Qudamah famously said: \\"We have no need to know the meaning of what God—Exalted is He—intended by His attributes—He is Great and Almighty. No deed is intended by them. No obligation is linked to them except belief in them. Belief in them is possible without knowing their meaning.\\"Jon Hoover, Ibn Taymiyya's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism (Leiden: Brill, 2007), p. 53 According to one scholar, it is evident that Ibn Qudamah \\"completely opposed discussion of theological matters and permitted no more than repeating what was said about God in the data of revelation.\\"Jon Hoover, Ibn Taymiyya's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism (Leiden: Brill, 2007), p. 19 In other words, Ibn Qudamah rejected \\"any attempt to link God’s attributes to the referential world of ordinary human language,\\" which has led some scholars to describe Ibn Qudamah's theology as \\"unreflective traditionalism,\\"Jon Hoover, Ibn Taymiyya's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism (Leiden: Brill, 2007), p. 236 that is to say, as a theological point of view which purposefully avoided any type of speculation or reflection upon the nature of God. Ibn Qudamah's attitude towards theology was challenged by certain later Hanbali thinkers like Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328), who broke with this type of \\"unreflective traditionalism\\" in order to engage \\"in [bold and unprecedented] interpretation[s] of the meanings of God’s attributes.\\" =Heresy= Ibn Qudamah seems to have been a formidable opponent of heresy in Islamic practice, as is evidenced by his famous words: \\"There is nothing outside of Paradise but hell-fire; there is nothing outside of the truth but error; there is nothing outside of the Way of the Prophet but heretical innovation.\\"John B. Henderson, The Construction of Orthodoxy and Heresy (New York: SUNY Press, 1998), epilogue =Intercession= Ibn Qudamah appears to have been a supporter of seeking the intercession of Muhammad in personal prayer, for he approvingly cites the famous prayer attributed to Ibn Hanbal (d. 855): \\"O God! I am turning to Thee with Thy Prophet, the Prophet of Mercy. O Muhammad! I am turning with you to my Lord for the fulfillment of my need.\\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 322 [trans slightly revised].Ibn Quduma, Wasiyya al- Muwaffaq Ibn Quduma al-Maqdisi, p. 93 Ibn Qudama also relates that which al-’Utbiyy narrated concerning one's visitation to the grave of Muhammad in Medina: > I was sitting by the grave of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, > when a bedouin man [a‘rābī] entered and said, “Peace be upon you, oh > Messenger of God. I have heard God say [in the Qur’an], ‘Had they come to > you [the Prophet] after having done injustice to themselves [sinned] and > asked God for forgiveness and [additionally had] the Messenger asked for > forgiveness on their behalf, they would have found God to be oft-turning [in > repentance] and merciful.’Qur'an, 4:64 And I have come to you seeking > forgiveness for my sin[s], and seeking your intercession near God.” He [the > bedouin man] then said the following poem: > O he who is the greatest of those buried in the grandest land, > [Of] those whose scent has made the valley and hills fragrant, > May my life be sacrificed for the grave that is your abode, > Where chastity, generosity and nobility reside! > Al-’Utbiyy then narrates that he fell asleep and saw the Prophet in a dream > and was informed that the bedouin man had indeed been forgiven.Ibn Qudāmah, > Abū Muḥammad, Al-Mughnī, (Beirut: Bayt al-Afkār al-Dawliyyah, 2004), p 795. After quoting the above event, Ibn Qudamah explicitly recommends that Muslims should use the above prayer when visiting the Prophet. He thus approves of asking the Prophet for his intercession even after his earthly death. = Mysticism = As is attested to by numerous sources, Ibn Qudamah was a devoted mystic and ascetic of the Qadiriyya order of Sufism, and reserved \\"a special place in his heart for mystics and mysticism\\" for the entirety of his life. Having inherited the \\"spiritual mantle\\" (k̲h̲irqa) of Abdul-Qadir Gilani prior to the renowned spiritual master's death, Ibn Qudamah was formally invested with the authority to initiate his own disciples into the Qadiriyya tariqa. Ibn Qudamah later passed on the initiatic mantle to his cousin Ibrāhīm b. ʿAbd al-Wāḥid (d. 1217), another important Hanbali jurist, who became one of the primary Qadiriyya spiritual masters of the succeeding generation. According to some classical Sufi chains, another one of Ibn Qudamah's major disciples was his nephew Ibn Abī ʿUmar Qudāmah (d. 1283), who later bestowed the k̲h̲irqa upon Ibn Taymiyyah, who, as many recent academic studies have shown, actually appears to have been a devoted follower of the Qadiriyya Sufi order in his own right, despite his criticisms of several of the most widespread, orthodox Sufi practices of his day and, in particular, of the philosophical influence of the Akbari school of Ibn Arabi.Makdisi, 'Ibn Taymiya: a Sufi of the Qadiriya order', American Journal of Arabic Studies 1, part 1 (1973), pp 118-28 Due to Ibn Qudamah's public support for the necessity of Sufism in orthodox Islamic practice, he gained a reputation for being one of \\"the eminent Sufis\\" of his era.Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī, al-Ta‘līq ‘alā al-Anājīl al-arba‘a wa-al-ta‘līq ‘alā al-Tawrāh wa-‘alā ghayrihā min kutub al-anbiyā’, 383, tr. L. Demiri, Muslim Exegesis of the Bible in Medieval Cairo, p. 16 =Relics= Ibn Qudamah supported using the relics of Muhammad for the deriving of holy blessings,Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 322 as is evident from his approved citing, in al- Mug̲h̲nī 5:468, of the case of Abdullah ibn Umar (d. 693), whom he records as having placed \\"his hand on the seat of the Prophet's minbar ... [and] then [having proceeded to] wipe his face with it.\\" This view was not novel or even unusual in any sense, as Ibn Qudamah would have found established support for the use of relics in the Quran, hadith, and in Ibn Hanbal's well-documented love for the veneration of Muhammad's relics. =Saints= A staunch supporter of the veneration of saints, Ibn Qudamah would have frequently seen the Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque in his native Damascus, where Zaynab bint Ali (d. 684) is venerated as the city's patron-saint. Ibn Qudamah staunchly criticized all who questioned or rejected the existence of saints, the veneration of whom had become an integral part of Sunni piety by the time periodAhmet T. Karamustafa, Sufism: The Formative Period (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), pp. 131-132 and which he \\"roundly endorsed.\\"Ahmet T. Karamustafa, Sufism: The Formative Period (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), p. 132 As scholars have noted, Hanbali authors of the period were \\"united in their affirmation of sainthood and saintly miracles,\\" and Ibn Qudamah was no exception. Thus, Ibn Qudamah vehemently criticized what he perceived to be the rationalizing tendencies of Ibn Aqil for his attack against the veneration of saints, saying: \\"As for the people of the Sunna who follow the traditions and pursue the path of the righteous ancestors, no imperfection taints them, not does any disgrace occur to them. Among them are the learned who practise their knowledge, the saints and the righteous men, the God-fearing and pious, the pure and the good, those who have attained the state of sainthood and the performance of miracles, and those who worship in humility and exert themselves in the study of religious law. It is with their praise that books and registers are adorned. Their annals embellish the congregations and assemblies. Hearts become alive at the mention of their life histories, and happiness ensues from following their footsteps. They are supported by religion; and religion is by them endorsed. Of them the Quran speaks; and the Quran they themselves express. And they are a refuge to men when events afflict them: for kings, and others of lesser rank, seek their visits, regarding their supplications to God as a means of obtaining blessings, and asking them to intercede for them with God.\\" See also *Islam *Ahmad bin Hanbal *Hanbali Scholars  References  Further reading * H.

It was a gift from Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880 and was built from the English oak timbers of the British Arctic exploration ship . Franklin Roosevelt requested the addition of a door with the presidential seal to conceal his leg braces. Many presidents since Hayes have used the desk at various locations in the White House. The desk was removed from the White House after the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, when President Lyndon Johnson allowed it to go on a traveling exhibition with artifacts of the Kennedy Presidential Library. It was then put on display in the Smithsonian Institution. President Jimmy Carter brought the desk back to the Oval Office in 1977, where it has remained with every president since, except George H. W. Bush, who used the C&O; desk in the Oval Office (but also kept the Resolute desk in the White House).  Description  = Design = Secretaire made from the timbers of the British Arctic ship Resolute The original design plan and elevation for the \\"President's Desk\\" were created on September 9, 1879. They are now kept by the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England, and can be viewed online. The National Maritime Museum's September 9, 1879, design plans are drawings for two different gifts proposed by the Admiralty but never executed, a \\"Secretaire\\" and a \\"Library Table\\". The library table and the President's secretaire were never implemented and these proposed gifts were replaced with William Evenden's 1880 Resolute desk. The Evenden desk delivered to President Hayes does not accord with the plan held at Greenwich except for the order that it \\"be made from the timbers of the late Arctic Ship Resolute\\". The design plan for the desk provided for ornate features to be incorporated into the proposed Library Table were tabulated on the September 9, 1879, Design Plans under the caption \\"References\\" as follows: An image of the desk purporting to be the gift delivered to President Hayes appeared as a steel engraving in the December 11, 1880, issue of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, New York, captioned: \\"Secretaire Made From the Timbers of the British Arctic Ship Resolute and Presented by Queen Victoria to the President of the United States\\". Beneath the half page image is a related article, which describes the desk inaccurately: The image and the written description in the newspaper article are not of the Evenden President's Desk delivered on November 23, 1880, but depicts the desk in the Admiralty's September 9, 1879, design plan for the library table. = Plaque = British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reads the inscription on the front of the desk in 1979, accompanied by President Jimmy Carter. A plate on the front of the desk presented to President Hayes bears the following inscription: Plaques with similar messages were fitted onto each desk made, the Resolute desk in the White House, Queen Victoria's writing table, and the Grinnell desk. = Modifications = The desk has been modified twice. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered a hinged front panel for the knee hole opening in order to hide his leg braces. The panel features the presidential sealone of only three of the ninety-seven in the White House that have the eagle's head turned towards the 13 arrows in the eagle's left talon, as opposed to the now-official arrangement with the eagle turned towards the olive branch in the right talon with the 13 leaves. The second modification was done to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. The first time a base was made for the Resolute desk was during the John F. Kennedy Administration. It was made of pine and did not match the desk well. It is very visible in a photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. playing under the desk. In January 1977, President Carter requested the desk be sent back to the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. Photos from January–February 1977 show the Resolute desk being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show the desk being used without a base. President Reagan requested that the desk be raised higher since he was hitting his legs on the top of the knee hole. The White House's earliest image of the desk with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982. A new, better-fitting base was built for the desk in 1986, and has remained with the desk since that time.  History  = HMS Resolute = Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to the United States, signing the memorandum of ratification on behalf of Spain in 1899 Queen Victoria visits HMS Resolute on December 16, 1856, the day before the ship was granted to her as a gesture of good will. was part of a five-ship squadron under Edward Belcher sent from Britain in April 1852 to search for the missing British explorer Sir John Franklin, who had left Britain in 1845 in search of the fabled Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic. The Western Division of the squadron, consisting of HMS Resolute and HMS Intrepid under Captain Kellett's command, sailed West and wintered at Deally Island off Melville Island. The Eastern Division, consisting of HMS Assistance and Pioneer under Sir Edward Belcher's command, sailed North up the Wellington Channel and wintered near Northumberland Sound. The men spent the autumn of 1852, and the spring and summer of 1853 sledging across the Arctic in search of the Franklin Expedition, as well as the men on HMS Investigator (Captain Robert McClure), and HMS Enterprise (Captain Richard Collinson). After finding and rescuing McClure and the crew of Investigator, Resolute and Intrepid sailed east, but had to winter in the pack ice, gradually moving East all winter. Belcher's two ships moved south in the Wellington Channel before being frozen in again near Disaster Bay. In the spring of 1854 Belcher ordered the abandonment of four of his five ships, and the men gathered at Beechey Island. By the time they were ready to leave, both Assistance and Pioneer had broken free and had traveled 45 miles South in the Wellington Channel until they were only a few miles from Beechey Island. This made no difference to Belcher who was simply desperate to go home. Since he had made his two ships \\"hells afloat\\" as he always did, his men were also desperate to leave. However, Kellett only abandoned Resolute and Intrepid under protest. The officers and men returned home on HMS North Star and the relief ships HMS Phoenix and HMS Talbot. As a matter of course in the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by courts-martial, so Belcher was tried for abandoning the four seaworthy vessels, as were Resolutes captain, Henry Kellett; Intrepid 's commander, Francis Leopold McClintock; and Pioneer 's commander, Sherard Osborn. All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his court-martial when they returned his sword to him in complete silence. Resolute continued to move slowly eastward in the pack ice, and one year later in the autumn of 1855 she was 1200 miles away from the place where she had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from New London, Connecticut saw Resolute adrift in the pack ice off Cape Walsingham in Davis Strait. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, George Henry, had preceded Resolute, and many were beginning to wonder if Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London. At the time of the salvage in 1855, Britain and America had several areas of active dispute: Britain's territorial claims in Belize, which the United States claimed violated the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty and disputes over fishing rights and the border between British Columbia and Washington Territory. In March 1855, an armed action by Washington Territory officials in the San Juan Islands had raised tensions between the countries. After the Resolute was recovered, Senator James Murray Mason, from Virginia, proposed a bill in Congress for the federal government to buy Resolute, refurbish her, and sail her back to Britain as a present. The bill passed, authorizing more than $40,000 for the work, and President Franklin Pierce signed it into law. Resolute was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she underwent a complete refit, and Commander Henry Hartstene USN, sailed her back to Britain, arriving at Spithead on December 12, 1856. After Resolute was towed to Cowes so that the Queen and Prince Albert could tour her, Captain Harstene presented the ship to Queen Victoria as a gesture of peace and good- will on December 17, 1856. Soon the talk of imminent war ceased, and the gift of Resolute was seen as instrumental in the easing of these tensions. In 1856, the United States and Britain appointed boundary commissioners to resolve the San Juan Island dispute. The disputes, however, would continue to flare until the 1860s, with conflict in the Pig War (1859) in the San Juan Islands, and the First Lord of the Admiralty warning that \\"drifting into war\\" was still possible in Central America until the Central American treaties of 1859-1860. Henry Grinnell, a New York merchant with an interest in the fate of Franklin's lost expedition, had supported the gifting of Resolute, and along with Lady Franklin had hoped the British would use the ship for a new search for those lost. However, by 1856 the Royal Navy doubted that any of Franklin's men could still be alive eleven years after they entered the Arctic, and declined to support a new search. Nor was the Navy willing to let Lady Franklin use Resolute for a privately funded search. Britain could not risk losing Resolute after the important role the ship had played in smoothing the relationship between her and America. Resolute stayed in home waters until she was taken to the breaker's dock at Chatham Dockyard in 1879. = Presidential desk = President Donald Trump, joined at the Resolute desk by NASA astronaut Kate Rubins (left) and First Daughter Ivanka Trump, talks with NASA astronauts Peggy Whitson and Jack Fischer onboard the International Space Station, April 24, 2017 President John F. Kennedy first placed the Resolute desk in the Oval Office in 1961. The desk left the White House from 1963 until President Carter brought it back to the Oval Office. Since then, presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump have used it in the Oval Office. Some presidents, such as George H. W. Bush, have used the desk in their private study rather than in the Oval Office. When president Lyndon B. Johnson took office in 1963, he found he was too large for the desk, and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used the Wilson desk, the desk from the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and mistakenly believed to be that of former president Woodrow Wilson. Gerald Ford, who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Nixon, used the Wilson desk throughout his term. Jimmy Carter, Ford's successor, brought the Resolute desk back to the Oval Office, where it remained until George H. W. Bush returned the Wilson desk to the Senate, preferring the C&O; desk that he used while serving as Vice President during the Reagan Administration. Bill Clinton subsequently brought the Resolute desk back again to the Oval Office, where it has remained since. In 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited President Barack Obama and gave him the original framed commissioning papers for Resolute and an ornamental pen holder made from the timbers of the anti-slavery ship HMS Gannet.  Other Resolute desks  After Resolute was broken up, Queen Victoria asked for several desks to be built from her timbers. Four desks were designed and made by William Evenden. A large partners desk was presented to President Rutherford B. Hayes on November 23, 1880, while a smaller lady's desk was presented to the widow of Henry Grinnell; this desk is now in the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Finally, the Queen had two desks made for herself: one is a small writing table cataloged online (with a photograph showing its plaque) .Royal Collection online catalog [The correct catalog number is RCIN 69405] The second is a smaller writing table which she had made for her private yacht, HMY Victoria and Albert. The National Museum of the Royal Navy lent the item for a short exhibition; however, the table was returned to the Royal Collection after the loan period ended in 2008.

The temple is located in the Roman Forum near the Regia and the House of the Vestal Virgins. The Temple of Vesta housed Vesta's holy fire, which was a symbol of Rome's safety and prosperity. The temple's most recognizable feature is its circular footprint. Since the worship of Vesta began in private homes, the architecture seems to pay homage to the architecture of early Roman homes. The temple used Greek architecture with Corinthian columns, marble, and had a central cella. The surviving structure indicates that there were twenty Corinthian columns built on a podium fifteen meters in diameter. The roof probably had a vent at the apex to allow smoke to release. History = Origins = The Temple of Vesta was first built by Numa Pompilius, who was Rome's second king. During his time in power he also built the original Regia and House of the Vestal Virgins and founded the order of the Vestals. Vesta was the patron goddess of the domestic hearth. In honour of Vesta, the Vestals would grow sacred grain to burn in the sacred hearth of the temple. The Romans believed that the sacred fire of Vesta was closely tied to the fortunes of the city. They believed that the extinction of the fire would lead to disaster falling on Rome. = Life in the Temple of Vesta = The Temple of Vesta was tended by the Vestal Virgins. The Vestal Virgins were freeborn, aristocratic women who had been sworn to celibacy in their service to Vesta. The Vestal oath of virginity during their 30-year tenure was what set them apart from other Roman women. While chastity until marriage was considered proper in Rome, long-term celibacy was not typical as women were generally expected to give birth to heirs for their husbands. Should a Vestal virgin become unchaste it was seen as a disruption between Rome and its gods. The Romans believed that such a disconnect between its gods would lead to pestilence, tragedy, or military defeats. The Vestals were also bound to serve the goddess Vesta and tended to the sacred fire of Vesta from childhood until maturity. A Vestal Virgin had a tenure that typically lasted from the age of 6 to 36 years at which point a Vestal virgin had the ability to leave the priesthood and marry. Most women chose to remain within the priesthood after their tenure ended. This choice to remain in the priesthood may have been a result of the respect and social privileges that came from their position. Most chose to spend their entire lives as a priestess. The Vestal Virgins were bound by strict rules and harsh punishments. For minor misdeeds the Vestals were subject to being whipped with rods. For more serious offences, such as having sexual relations or allowing the sacred fire to go out, the Vestals were sentenced to being interred in a subterranean cell and left to die with little food or water. Vestal Virgins could also be punished if something bad happened to Rome. If a Vestal Virgin broke her oath of celibacy, Rome's connection to the gods was considered broken, which resulted in Rome being punished by the gods. The belief that a Vestal's purity was connected to Rome' s fate caused some Vestal Virgins to be accused of breaking their oaths and punished when tragedy struck Rome. One such example took place in 114 BC, when Helvia, the Virgin daughter of L. Helvius, was killed by lightning. Helvia's death was interpreted as a sign that there was trouble in the Temple of Vesta. Three Vestal Virgins were sentenced to death for breaking their oath and being unchaste. The Vestal Virgins were closely watched and harshly punished when they broke their oaths, or suspected of breaking their oaths. However, respect and social privileges that came from their position encouraged many to remain in the priesthood. = Building = The temple of Vesta was unique in its design, as it was round as opposed to rectangular like many other temples. The circular shape of the Vesta temples were based on the primitive round hut. Some researchers argue that the circular footprint of the Temple of Vesta was meant to symbolize the earth and the domed roof symbolized the heavens. All temples to Vesta were round, and had entrances facing east to enhance the connection between Vesta’s fire and the sun as sources of life. The Temple of Vesta represents the site of ancient religious activity as far back as 7th century BCE. 3D Recreation of the Temple of Vesta Archaeologists have found that the Temple of Vesta was built on a circular foundation. Circling the exterior of the temple were twenty fluted columns. Each column was 0.52 meters in diameter with a base 1.6 meters in circumference. The columns were topped with a Corinthian capital. The radius of the temple was about 6.19 meters. This measured from the outer line of the architrave to the middle of the temple. The interior wall is 0.60 meters thick and the diameter of the inside of the temple is 8.6 meters. The Temple was on a high platform and wide steps lead up to the entrance. = Location = It was one of the earliest structures located in the Roman Forum, although its final reincarnation was the result of subsequent rebuilding. Instead of a cult statue in the cella, there was a hearth which held the sacred flame. The temple was the storehouse for the legal wills and documents of Roman Senators and cult objects such as the Palladium. The Palladium was a statue of Athena (Roman Minerva) believed to have been brought by Aeneas from Troy; the statue was felt to be one of the Pignora Imperii, or pledges of imperium, of Ancient Rome. The temple was closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire in the 4th-century. The Temple of Vesta, the Atrium of the Vestal Virgins (House of the Vestal Virgins), and the Regia are the earliest evidence of the Cult of Vesta. The original Temple of Vesta stood on the east end of the forum near the house of the Vestal Virgins and the Regia. Beyond that cluster of buildings is the Via Sacra (Sacred Way) which ran uphill. This cluster of buildings was destroyed in the fire of Nero. In 575 BC the temple was rebuilt in its current location. Outer wall of the Temple of Vesta = Reconstructions/Deconstructions of the Temple in Antiquity = The temple was rebuilt many times because it was destroyed many times. The first destruction of the temple was by the Gauls in 390 BC. Livy records that after the Gauls burned down the temple they soon returned to find that the Vestals had rekindled their sacred fire among the ruins of the temple. According to Ovid, the second destruction in 241 BC may have started because of the fire in the temple itself. During the fire, the Vestals were unable to collect the cult objects, and they were destroyed along with the Temple of Vesta. Lucius Caecilius Metellus, the Pontifex Maximus at the time, went into the burning temple to save the palladium. Lucius Caecilius was blinded by the flames and it was believed that this was the result of him breaking the tradition of the temple which barres men from entering. Fires also occurred again in 210 BC and again in the early first century BC. The temple was rebuilt again during the reigns of Augustus and Nero. Finally, it burned down in 191 AD and was rebuilt for the last time during the reign of Septimius Severus.

File:Temple Vesta Forum Romanum Rome Italy.jpgThe most prominent feature of the ruins that were once the Temple of Vesta is the hearth.  Modern Day Temple of Vesta  = Modern reconstruction = The Roman Forum in Modern Day The Temple of Vesta remained reasonably intact until the Renaissance. However, in 1549 AD, the temple was demolished and its marble was repurposed to build churches and papal palaces. Most of our knowledge about what the original Temple of Vesta looked like come from its depictions on coins and art. One piece of art that depicts the Temple of Vesta is a marble relief in the Uffizi in Florence, Italy. These depictions and others like it allow us to understand what the temple looked like in antiquity. Modern archaeological investigation began on the site of the Temple of Vesta in the late nineteenth century. The exploration began in 1877 with archaeologist R. Lanciani's excavation of the Temple of Vesta and the publishing his findings. During his exploration he was able to uncover many parts of the Temple of Vesta including parts of the entablature and ceiling. Exploration continued from 1898 to 1900 when Giaccomo Boni, director of the Roman Forum, embarked on a new round of excavations. His works were published in 1900 and included measurements and sections of the temple's foundation, photos and drawings of the principal architectural elements, and a restored plan of the building. Finally, in 1930-1931 Alfonso Bartoli reconstructed two and a half of the Temple of Vesta's bays which can still be seen in the forum today.

The IP protocol does not provide for the authentication of the source IP address of an IP packet, enabling the source address to be falsified in a strategy called IP address spoofing, and creating potential internet security and stability problems. Use of false source IP addresses allows denial-of-service attacks (DoS) or one-way attacks (where the response from the victim host is so well known that return packets need not be received to continue the attack). IP traceback is critical for identifying sources of attacks and instituting protection measures for the Internet. Most existing approaches to this problem have been tailored toward DoS attack detection. Such solutions require high numbers of packets to converge on the attack path(s).  Probabilistic packet marking  Savage et al. suggested probabilistically marking packets as they traverse routers through the Internet. They propose that the router mark the packet with either the router’s IP address or the edges of the path that the packet traversed to reach the router. For the first alternative, marking packets with the router's IP address, analysis shows that in order to gain the correct attack path with 95% accuracy as many as 294,000 packets are required. The second approach, edge marking, requires that the two nodes that make up an edge mark the path with their IP addresses along with the distance between them. This approach would require more state information in each packet than simple node marking but would converge much faster. They suggest three ways to reduce the state information of these approaches into something more manageable. The first approach is to XOR each node forming an edge in the path with each other. Node a inserts its IP address into the packet and sends it to b. Upon being detected at b (by detecting a 0 in the distance), b XORs its address with the address of a. This new data entity is called an edge id and reduces the required state for edge sampling by half. Their next approach is to further take this edge id and fragment it into k smaller fragments. Then, randomly select a fragment and encode it, along with the fragment offset so that the correct corresponding fragment is selected from a downstream router for processing. When enough packets are received, the victim can reconstruct all of the edges the series of packets traversed (even in the presence of multiple attackers). Due to the high number of combinations required to rebuild a fragmented edge id, the reconstruction of such an attack graph is computationally intensive according to research by Song and Perrig. Furthermore, the approach results in a large number of false positives. As an example, with only 25 attacking hosts in a DDoS attack the reconstruction process takes days to build and results in thousands of false positives. Accordingly, Song and Perrig propose the following traceback scheme: instead of encoding the IP address interleaved with a hash, they suggest encoding the IP address into an 11 bit hash and maintain a 5 bit hop count, both stored in the 16-bit fragment ID field. This is based on the observation that a 5-bit hop count (32 max hops) is sufficient for almost all Internet routes. Further, they suggest that two different hashing functions be used so that the order of the routers in the markings can be determined. Next, if any given hop decides to mark it first checks the distance field for a 0, which implies that a previous router has already marked it. If this is the case, it generates an 11-bit hash of its own IP address and then XORs it with the previous hop. If it finds a non-zero hop count it inserts its IP hash, sets the hop count to zero and forwards the packet on. If a router decides not to mark the packet it merely increments the hop count in the overloaded fragment id field. Song and Perrig identify that this is not robust enough against collisions and thus suggest using a set of independent hash functions, randomly selecting one, and then hashing the IP along with a FID or function id and then encoding this. They state that this approach essentially reduces the probability of collision to (1/(211)m). For further details see Song and Perrig.  Deterministic packet marking  Belenky and Ansari, outline a deterministic packet marking scheme. They describe a more realistic topology for the Internet – that is composed of LANs and ASs with a connective boundary – and attempt to put a single mark on inbound packets at the point of network ingress. Their idea is to put, with random probability of .5, the upper or lower half of the IP address of the ingress interface into the fragment id field of the packet, and then set a reserve bit indicating which portion of the address is contained in the fragment field. By using this approach they claim to be able to obtain 0 false positives with .99 probability after only 7 packets. Rayanchu and Barua provide another spin on this approach (called DERM). Their approach is similar in that they wish to use and encoded IP address of the input interface in the fragment id field of the packet. Where they differ from Belenky and Ansari is that they wish to encode the IP address as a 16-bit hash of that IP address. Initially they choose a known hashing function. They state that there would be some collisions if there were greater than 2^16 edge routers doing the marking. They attempt to mitigate the collision problem by introducing a random distributed selection of a hash function from the universal set, and then applying it to the IP address. In either hashing scenario, the source address and the hash are mapped together in a table for later look-up along with a bit indicating which portion of the address they have received. Through a complicated procedure and a random hash selection, they are capable of reducing address collision. By using a deterministic approach they reduce the time for their reconstruction procedure for their mark (the 16-bit hash). However, by encoding that mark through hashing they introduce the probability of collisions, and thus false-positives. Shokri and Varshovi introduced the concepts of Dynamic Marking and Mark-based Detection with \\"Dynamic Deterministic Packet Marking,\\" (DDPM). In dynamic marking it is possible to find the attack agents in a large scale DDoS network. In the case of a DRDoS it enables the victim to trace the attack one step further back to the source, to find a master machine or the real attacker with only a few numbers of packets. The proposed marking procedure increases the possibility of DRDoS attack detection at the victim through mark-based detection. In the mark-based method, the detection engine takes into account the marks of the packets to identify varying sources of a single site involved in a DDoS attack. This significantly increases the probability of detection. In order to satisfy the end-to-end arguments approach, fate-sharing and also respect to the need for scalable and applicable schemes, only edge routers implement a simple marking procedure. The fairly negligible amount of delay and bandwidth overhead added to the edge routers make the DDPM implementable. S. Majumdar, D. Kulkarni and C. Ravishankar proposes a new method to traceback the origin of DHCP packets in ICDCN 2011. Their method adds a new DHCP option that contains the MAC address and the ingress port of the edge switch which had received the DHCP packet. This new option will be added to the DHCP packet by the edge switch. This solution follows DHCP RFCs. Previous IP traceback mechanisms have overloaded IP header fields with traceback information and thus are violating IP RFCs. Like other mechanisms, this paper also assumes that the network is trusted. The paper presents various performance issues in routers/switches that were considered while designing this practical approach. However, this approach is not applicable to any general IP packet.  Router-based approach  With router-based approaches, the router is charged with maintaining information regarding packets that pass through it. For example, Sager proposes to log packets and then data mine them later. This has the benefit of being out of band and thus not hindering the fast path. Snoeren et al. propose marking within the router. The idea proposed in their paper is to generate a fingerprint of the packet, based upon the invariant portions of the packet (source, destination, etc.) and the first 8 bytes of payload (which is unique enough to have a low probability of collision). More specifically, m independent simple hash functions each generate an output in the range of 2n-1. A bit is then set at the index generated to create a fingerprint when combined with the output of all other hash functions. All fingerprints are stored in a 2n bit table for later retrieval. The paper shows a simple family of hash functions suitable for this purpose and present a hardware implementation of it. The space needed at each router is limited and controllable (2n bits). A small n makes the probability of collision of packet hashes (and false identification) higher. When a packet is to be traced back, it is forwarded to originating routers where fingerprint matches are checked. As time passes, the fingerprint information is “clobbered” by hashes generated by other packets. Thus, the selectivity of this approach degrades with the time that has passed between the passage of the packet and the traceback interrogation. Another known take on the router-based schemes comes from Hazeyama et al. In their approach, they wish to integrate the SPIE approach as outlined by Snoeren, with their approach of recording the layer 2 link-id along with the network ID (VLAN or true ID), the MAC address of the layer 2 switch that received the packet and the link id it came in on. This information is then put into two look-up tables – both containing the switch (layer 2 router) MAC id for look-up. They rely on the MAC:port tuple as a method of tracing a packet back (even if the MAC address has been spoofed). To help mitigate the problem of storage limitations they use Snoeren’s hashing approach and implementation (SPIE) – modifying it to accept their information for hashing. They admit their algorithm is slow (O(N2)) and with only 3.3 million packet hashes being stored the approximate time before the digest tables are invalid is 1 minute. This dictates that any attack response must be real-time – a possibility only on single-administrative LAN domains.  Out- of-band approaches  The ICMP traceback scheme Steven M. Bellovin proposes probabilistically sending an ICMP traceback packet forward to the destination host of an IP packet with some low probability. Thus, the need to maintain state in either the packet or the router is obviated. Furthermore, the low probability keeps the processing overhead as well as the bandwidth requirement low. Bellovin suggests that the selection also be based on pseudo-random numbers to help block attempts to time attack bursts. The problem with this approach is that routers commonly block ICMP messages because of security issues associated with them.  Trace-back of active attack flows  In this type of solution, an observer tracks an existing attack flow by examining incoming and outgoing ports on routers starting from the host under attack. Thus, such a solution requires having privileged access to routers along the attack path. To bypass this restriction and automate this process, Stone proposes routing suspicious packets on an overlay network using ISP edge routers. By simplifying the topology, suspicious packets can easily be re- routed to a specialized network for further analysis. By nature of DoS, any such attack will be sufficiently long lived for tracking in such a fashion to be possible. Layer-three topology changes, while hard to mask to a determined attacker, have the possibility of alleviating the DoS until the routing change is discovered and subsequently adapted to. Once the attacker has adapted, the re-routing scheme can once again adapt and re-route; causing an oscillation in the DoS attack; granting some ability to absorb the impact of such an attack.  Other approaches  Hal Burch and William Cheswick propose a controlled flooding of links to determine how this flooding affects the attack stream. Flooding a link will cause all packets, including packets from the attacker, to be dropped with the same probability. We can conclude from this that if a given link were flooded, and packets from the attacker slowed, then this link must be part of the attack path. Then recursively upstream routers are “coerced” into performing this test until the attack path is discovered. The traceback problem is complicated because of spoofed packets. Thus, a related effort is targeted towards preventing spoofed packets; known as ingress filtering. Ingress Filtering restricts spoofed packets at ingress points to the network by tracking the set of legitimate source networks that can use this router. Park and Lee present an extension of Ingress Filtering at layer 3. They present a means of detecting false packets, at least to the subnet, by essentially making use of existing OSPF routing state to have routers make intelligent decisions about whether or not a packet should be routed.

Biography Halperin was born on March 3, 1906. He studied Latin American issues. In 1935, he traveled to Cuba with the League of American Writers to investigate possible human rights abuses. Sometime during this period, Halperin joined the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA). In the late summer of 1941, Halperin went to work in the Office of the Coordinator of Information which later became the Research Division of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), itself a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency. Halperin became head of the Latin American Research and Analysis Division and special assistant to Duncan Lee. During this period, he may have become an espionage agent and agreed to provide intelligence for the Joseph Stalin-era Soviet intelligence service, the NKVD. Halperin's NKVD codename was \\"Hare.\\" He became a member of the Golos spy network operated by the NKVD's chief of American operations Gaik Ovakimian. With access to the OSS cable room, Halperin could secure copies of secret U.S. reports from any part of the world. Through the Golos spy network, Halperin provided Soviet intelligence with a large quantity of sensitive U.S. diplomatic dispatches, including reports from Ambassador John Gilbert Winant in London on the position of the Polish government-in- exile towards negotiations with Stalin, Turkey's foreign policy toward Romania, the State Department's instructions to the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, the U.S. embassy in Morocco's reports on that country's government, reports on the U.S. government's relationship with Vichy and Free French factions and persons in exile, reports of peace feelers from dissident Germans passed to the Vatican, U.S. attitudes towards Josip Broz Tito's Communist Front activities in Yugoslavia, and discussions between the Greek government and the United States regarding Soviet ambitions in the Balkans. Halperin also distorted OSS reports with false information in order to reflect the views of Stalin, the Soviet Union, and the Communist Party of the United States. Bentley allegations In 1945, defecting Soviet espionage courier Elizabeth Bentley told agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that from 1942 to 1944, when he was an official of the OSS, Haperin delivered \\"to Mary Price and later to myself mimeographed bulletins and reports prepared by OSS on a variety of topics and also supplied excerpts from State Department cables to which he evidently had access.\\" She added that \\"some time early in 1945 'JACK', [Soviet agent Joseph Katz] the Russian contact at that time, told me that Halperin had been accused by General William J. Donovan, the head of OSS, of being a Soviet agent...\\"Statement of Elizabeth Terrill Bentley, November 30, 1945, FBI file: Silvermaster, Vol. 6 , pp. 33–34 (PDF pp. 34–35) The next day, the FBI notified Harry S. Truman's White House that \\"according to a \\"highly confidential source,\\" among those \\"employed by the government of the United States\\" who \\"have been furnishing data and information to persons outside the Federal government, who are in turn transmitting this information to espionage agents of the Soviet government,\\" was \\"Maurice Halperin, Office of Strategic Services.\\" Subsequent surveillance of Halperin disclosed that he was in contact with Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, Lauchlin Currie, Philip and Mary Jane Keeney, and others. After the OSS was dissolved in 1945, Halperin transferred to the State Department and worked as an adviser to United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson on Latin American affairs. Halperin was an advisor to the United Nations at the first conference in San Francisco. He resigned from the State Department in 1946 to take the position of chair of Latin American studies at Boston University. In 1953, after Soviet cables were secretly decrypted by U.S. counter-intelligence, Maurice Halperin was called before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee to defend himself on charges of espionage. Halperin denied the charges, but nevertheless fled to Mexico and then, to avoid extradition, to the Soviet Union. Among the friends he made there was the British defector, Donald Maclean as well as Cuban revolutionary leader Che Guevara. Disenchanted with communism in the Soviet Union, Halperin accepted Guevara's invitation to come to Havana in 1962. There he worked for the Fidel Castro government for five years before political tensions forced him to leave for Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He became there a political science professor at Simon Fraser University, and wrote several books critical of Castro's government and the socio-political situation in Cuba. He died in Canada on February 9, 1995. Legacy After Halperin's death, the release of the Venona project decryptions of coded Soviet cables, as well as information gleaned from Soviet KGB archives, revealed that Halperin was involved in espionage activities on behalf of the Soviet Union while serving in an official capacity with the United States government.Return to Responses, Reflections and Occasional Papers Schecter, Jerrold and Leona, Sacred Secrets: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed American History, Potomac Press, 2002Haynes, John Earl & Klehr, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America, Yale University Press, 2000 See also *NKVD *Venona project Publications * Maurice Halperin, \\"Return to Havana\\".

It was one of the few films to be shown in Sensurround, which used extended-range bass frequencies to give a sense of vibration to the viewers during the coaster rides. Plot An unnamed man (Timothy Bottoms) (simply called \\"young man\\" in the credits) sneaks into Ocean View Amusement Park and places a small radio-controlled bomb on the tracks of the park's wooden roller coaster, The Rocket. The bomb detonates, a coaster train derails, killing and injuring the riders. Safety inspector Harry Calder (George Segal), who initially cleared the ride, is called to the park to investigate. A park worker tells Calder that he saw what he thought was a park maintenance man up on the tracks earlier that day but did not state that the man was someone other than the park had authorized to be there. In Pittsburgh the bomber causes a fire on a dark ride at another park. Calder suspects the incidents might be linked, and learns that the executives of companies running the largest amusement parks in America are holding a meeting in Chicago. Calder flies to Chicago and intrudes on the meeting. One of the executives plays a tape sent by the bomber, wherein he demands $1 million to stop his activities. Back home, Calder is visited by FBI Agent Hoyt (Richard Widmark), who says the extortion money is to be delivered by Calder at Kings Dominion. There, Calder is ordered to wait at a telephone and the bomber calls, warning him there is a bomb in the park. He sends Calder a two-way radio so that he can keep contact, then orders Calder to go on various rides in the park such as the Rebel Yell roller coaster. While Calder is riding on the Skyway to the station near the Singing Mushrooms, the bomber tells Calder that the bomb is located in the radio. He warns Calder not to throw it away, because it will explode on impact on the paths below, which are occupied by many of the park's visitors. He orders Calder to falsely signal that he has made the delivery, in order to distract the FBI, then leave the money on a bench. Calder complies and walks away. Later, Hoyt admits that he marked the money (violating the bomber's instructions). Calder demands to be sent home and leaves the bomb radio with the bomb squad. Back home, Calder gets another call from the bomber. He blames Calder for the marked money, and threatens another attack. Assuming it will be directed at Calder personally, he deduces that the next target will be Revolution at Magic Mountain. The FBI rejects Calder's hypothesis, but decide to investigate anyway because the ride is scheduled to debut on July 4, when park attendance will be at its highest for the season. Agents disguised as park maintenance men eventually find a bomb attached to the tracks and disarm it. The bomber returns to his car and gets a new bomb just as the Revolution is about to open. In order to get on board, he pays a park guest $100 for his \\"Gold Ticket\\", which entitles the holder to be one of the first passengers. He places the bomb under his seat in the rear of the train. Following the inaugural ride, Calder recognizes the bomber's voice during his ride exit interview with a reporter. He chases the bomber, and alerts the agents that he might have placed something in the coaster train. The train leaves the chain lift on its second ride through. The bomber is eventually cornered and threatens to blow up the ride, holding the detonator in his hand while the agents try to jam the signal. He demands a firearm. Calder takes one from an agent and begins to hand it to him. Agents succeed in jamming the detonator's signal, and alert Calder. Calder retains the gun but in doing so accidentally shoots the bomber, who then runs away. He hops a fence into the area below the Revolution and runs blindly, eventually circling back toward Calder. The bomber climbs onto the track, but sees Calder and freezes. He is hit and killed by the coaster train. The ride re-opens following the accident.

Special low-frequency bass speakers were used during the roller coaster sequences. Sensurround was employed in only three other films released by Universal: Earthquake (1974), Midway (1976), and the theatrical version of Battlestar Galactica (1978). \\"Sensurround is as big a star as there is in movies today,\\" said Sidney Sheinberg, head of MCA, who attributed the better-than-expected success of Earthquake and Midway at the box office to the device.Movies: Universal hopes to ride 'Rollercoaster' all the way to bank Aljean Harmetz.

Helen Hunt, in her first feature film, has a supporting role as Tracy Calder, Harry's teenage daughter. Steve Guttenberg, in his first film role, has an uncredited bit part as a messenger at Magic Mountain who brings the plans for the Revolution to Calder and Hoyt. Craig Wasson, in his second film, appears as a hippie. Radio announcer Charlie Tuna also appears in the film as the MC for the concert and The Revolution coaster launch. The film features an appearance by the band Sparks for the roller coaster's opening concert, playing the songs \\"Fill 'Er Up\\" and \\"Big Boy\\" from their 1976 album Big Beat. Sparks later cited their appearance in the film when asked about the biggest regret of their career. =Locations= Filming started 13 September 1976.'Rollercoaster' in Production Kilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times 1 Sep 1976: g5 Several real amusement parks were used in the film for the various park and roller coaster scenes. Ocean View Park in Norfolk, Virginia was used for the first park in the film.'Thrill Ride' a Film Star The Washington Post 7 Sep 1976: B7. Although the park was located on the Chesapeake Bay, it was described as a west coast park in the film. Goldstone chose the park because of its old fashioned feeling. The park's major wooden roller coaster, The Skyrocket, was renamed simply \\"The Rocket\\" for the film. Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia, also appeared in the film. Some of the rides featured in the film, such as the Shenandoah Lumber Company and Rebel Yell wooden roller coaster, still exist today. The final park used was Magic Mountain (now called Six Flags Magic Mountain) in Valencia, California. The park's Great American Revolution roller coaster was featured prominently in the film's climax. Originally, Kennywood was one of the locations to be used in the opening \\"crash\\" segment of the film. But after the park's owners declined their participation, the producers of the film ended up shooting the \\"Wonder World\\" segment at Kings Dominion instead. According to Goldstone, the three parks that appeared in the final film were chosen from over 20 candidates. Additionally, parts of the movie were filmed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. Soundtrack The film's musical score was written by composer Lalo Schifrin. Reception =Box Office= Despite having been released in the late spring of 1977, and being overshadowed by the smash hit Star Wars, it went on to be a moderate success at the box office. However it was considered a financial disappointment and Universal lost enthusiasm for Sensurround films. =Critical= Reviews were mixed. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"effective pop entertainment that, like an amusement-park ride, deals in the sensation of suspense for the foolish fun of it.\\"Canby, Vincent (June 11, 1977). \\"Screen: 'Rollercoaster' on Track\\". The New York Times. 12. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and called it \\"a traffic accident masquerading as a movie\\" with \\"one of the dullest villains imaginable.\\"Siskel, Gene (June 13, 1977). \\"'Rollercoaster' is a disaster of a disaster\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 7. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote in a positive review that the film \\"is not so much a disaster story as an unexpectedly articulate and well-polished piece of cat-and-mouse suspense whose derivation is more from Hitchcock than, say, Irwin Allen.\\"Charles, Champlin (June 10, 1977). \\"'Rollercoaster' a Rousing Ride\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that \\"[t]he Sensurround process, fundamentally unnecessary as it is, supplements the subjective visual thrills effectively.\\" He added, \\"There's such a disparity of interest between the locations themselves and the melodramatic motions the actors are required to go through that one could easily believe Universal had a greater stake in the amusement park business than the movie business.\\"Arnold, Gary (June 10, 1977). \\"'Rollercoaster': A Good Ride For the Amusement Parks\\". The Washington Post. B7. Variety said that, 'The rollercoaster rides are the picture’s highlights and they are fabulous.' Time Out London felt that 'the results should have been sensational,' but that, 'ultimately the film-makers botched the job. Many of the best runs are interrupted by close-ups, and the filler plot is dumb in the extreme.' The film holds an approval rating of 53% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes as of October 2020, based on 15 reviews.

Education  Noboa studied political and social sciences and is Doctor in Law from the Catholic University of Guayaquil. He was chancellor of the University in 1986–1991 and 1991–1996.  Political career  Noboa was governor of Guayas Province from March 1983 to August 1984. In the 1998 presidential elections he was the running mate of Jamil Mahuad, who won. He was sworn in as Vice President of Ecuador on August 10, 1998.  Presidency (2000-2003)  On January 21, 2000, a military coup deposed Mahuad's government and the following day Noboa became President of Ecuador in constitutional order. He had the popular support of the country's indigenous people. Noboa's presidency was marked by attempts to revive the Ecuadorian economy, which was in a recession at the time, including the freeing of US$400 million worth of assets frozen by the previous government. He left office in 2003 after Lucio Gutiérrez was victorious in the 2002 presidential election.  Controversy  Noboa was being accused of mishandling the country's foreign debt\\"Ecuador ex-president seeks asylum\\", BBC News, July 28, 2003 by the former president, León Febres Cordero. After his term ended, accusations of irregularities in foreign debt negotiation that cost the country $9 billion dollars were levelled at the former president. He completely denied the charges, which could have had him sent to jail for twenty five years if convicted. Claiming that he was the victim of unfair persecution, he applied for political asylum in the Dominican Republic, which was granted on August 11, 2003. The Supreme Court case against him was annulled by an unconstitutional, yet functioning, Supreme Court on the grounds that the case was not initiated by a two-thirds congressional vote as the Constitution stipulates. Shortly after, however, the presidency of Gutiérrez ended and the charges were reinstated. He was placed under house arrest in May 2005 and Ecuador's Interior Minister planned to prosecute. On March 16, 2006, a Supreme Court judge lifted the detention order and charged Noboa of being an accessory after the fact.

Initial proposals Proposals for the reinstatement of trams or a light rail system in Leeds which were withdrawn in 1959 have been ongoing since the 1970s with various plans for varying light rail systems including ones which had planned partially or fully underground routes in the city centre. The cancelled plans mentioned in this article had dated back to the early 1990s. =Route= The planned system included three lines, which were to have been: *Line 1 (South Line), to Stourton and Tingley via Hunslet, Belle Isle and Middleton *Line 2 (North Line), to Weetwood via the University of Leeds, Hyde Park and Headingley *Line 3 (East Line), to Whinmoor via St James's Hospital, Harehills and Seacroft All three lines would have met in Leeds city centre in a loop line running along The Headrow, Park Row, Boar Lane, Kirkgate and behind Kirkgate Market. The three lines were to have been the start of a wider system which included plans for other tram lines from Leeds city centre to Bradford via Armley, Bramley and Stanningley and to Alwoodley via Chapeltown, Chapel Allerton and Moortown (the latter being mentioned in the draft Leeds Unitary Development Plan). Funding delays Following long standing delays in attempting to gain funding throughout the 1990s due to rejections by the previous John Major administration, in 2002 Leeds was successful in acquiring central government funding for the construction of the scheme. Two consortia of Momentis (which included FirstGroup, Bombardier Transportation, Bouygues and Jarvis Facilities) and Airelink (which included Arriva and Siemens Transportation Systems) had bid on the construction and operation of Leeds Supertram which was intended to have opened in 2007 or 2008. Preparation work on Leeds Supertram had started in 2003 where preparatory work was done at Leeds City Square and around the junction of the A61 South Accommodation Road and A639 Hunslet Road. Project suspension and cancellation However work to construct the system that was due to start in earnest in 2004 was suspended because of costs that were originally £500 million had risen far above this level to figures around £1 billion. This had resulted in a cut back to the system that would have seen Line 1 only go from the city centre to the park and ride site at Stourton and this would have saved £250 million from the construction of the scheme and efforts were done to lower development costs along the other planned routes. However despite this in late 2005, Transport Minister Alistair Darling said that he would not give the go-ahead for the scheme, despite £40 million having already been spent into the development of the scheme. Future alternatives Alternatives for the future of transport in Leeds are now being discussed, in particular a Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system, which the government claim can deliver some of the benefits of Supertram with lower capital costs due to unsegregated routes and greater flexibility but an on long term higher price (due to shorter life expectancy of rolling stock). However, no system of this type has yet been delivered in the UK, which introduces an element of risk, although similar systems in the US have experienced lower ridership than comparable light rail lines. Another possibility currently being investigated by the local transport authority is a tram-train system. On such a system trams are capable of running onto mainline railways, being either built to handle 25 kV AC electrification or being partially diesel-powered (UK trams are electrified at 750 V DC).

For the 28 million years of existence of the Hawaiian Islands, they have been isolated from the rest of the world by vast stretches of the Pacific Ocean, and this isolation has resulted in the evolution of an incredible diversity of endemic species, including fungi, mosses, snails, birds, and other wildlife. In the lush, moist forests high in the mountains, trees are draped with vines, orchids, ferns, and mosses. This ecoregion includes one of the world's wettest places, the slopes of Mount Waialeale, which average of rainfall per year. Coastal mesic forests Coastal mesic forests are found on the windward slopes of the major islands from sea level to . These forests have been dominated by the native hala (Pandanus tectorius) and hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus) and naturalized (Polynesian introductions) kukui (Aleurites moluccana) and milo (Thespesia populnea) for the past 1,000–2,000 years. The Polynesian-introduced noni (Morinda citrifolia), pia (Tacca leontopetaloides), and kī (Cordyline fruticosa) are also common in this zone.

The original B5 version was produced only as an Avant, Audi's name for an estate car/station wagon. The second version, the B7, was released initially as a four-door five-seat saloon/sedan, with the Avant following a short while later. A two-door four-seat Cabriolet version was subsequently added. Their internal combustion engines are longitudinal and located at the front. The \\"RS\\" initials are taken from the —literally translated as \\"racing sport\\", and is the Audi marque's highest trim level, positioned above the \\"S\\" model specification of Audi's regular model line-up.

The vehicle, like its RS2 predecessor, was available only as an Avant and was built on an existing platform, in this case, the Volkswagen Group B5 platform shared with the A4 and S4. Retail price was around DM 103,584. The RS 4 was available for sale in most of Europe, parts of Asia and in some Latin American countries. Audi produced 6,030 units between 1999 and 2001. =B5 bodywork and styling= Although related to the Audi B5 S4, many of the outer body panels were altered, with wider front and rear wheel arches, to allow for the wider axle track on the RS 4. With unique front and rear bumpers and side sills, and the rear spoiler from the S4 Avant, the aerodynamic modifications achieved a drag coefficient of Cd 0.34. Although the B5 S4 came in a saloon car body style, the B5 RS 4 was only available in the Avant version. Luggage space, measured according to the industry standard VDA method was with the rear seats in the upright position, and with the seats folded flat. =B5 powertrain= power (red) and torque (blue) curves The engine was developed from the 2.7 litre 90° V6 'biturbo' used in the B5 S4. It displaced and had five valves per cylinder. The parts code prefix was 078 and the identification codes were: early version, 2000 (EU2 compliant): ASJ, and later version, 2000-01 (to EU3 standard): AZR. This engine was developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). It featured enlarged intake and smaller exhaust ports on the two Cosworth cast aluminium alloy ALSi7mg cylinder heads, two parallel BorgWarner K04-series turbochargers, two larger side-mounted intercoolers (SMICs), dished piston crowns, stronger connecting rods, larger intake ducting, enlarged exhaust system, and a re-calibrated engine management system. The modifications increased the engine's output from and of torque in S4 form to at 7,000 rpm and at 6,000 rpm. The engine was controlled by a Bosch MotronicBosch Automotive Technology Motronic for manifold injection ME 7.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), using a Bosch 'E-Gas'Bosch Automotive Technology Electronic throttle control (ETC/EGAS) for manifold injection electronic drive by wire throttle. It had multipoint sequential fuel injection, a MAF, six individual single-spark coils and NGK longlife spark plugs. The engine oil was cooled by a dual oil:water cooler and an oil:air cooler. A six-speed manual transmission (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: FDP) (gear ratios—1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.806, 6th: 0.684), cooled by a NACA duct in the engine undertray, and Audi's Torsen-based quattro system, using the Torsen T-1 \\"automatic torque biasing\\" (ATB) center differential, with a 50:50 default bias were standard.

B7 (Typ 8E, 2006–2008)  There was no RS 4 built on the Audi \\"B6\\" platform that served as the basis for the Audi A4 between 2001 and 2005. However, after a long hiatus, the second Audi RS 4 quattro (Typ 8E) was built on Audi's \\"B7\\" A4 platform, by quattro GmbH in Neckarsulm, Germany. It was unveiled in February 2005 at Audi's 'quattro Night' celebration at the company headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany. The RS 4 became available to European customers in mid-2006. It was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January, and arrived in June 2006 in North America. The production run of the B7 RS 4 was 2006 to 2008 inclusive, although only 2007 and 2008 model year were sold in the United States. To date, approximately 10,000 B7 RS 4s have been built, of which around 2,000 are in the USA. The B7 RS 4 Cabriolet was sold in Europe from late 2006 to 2008. It was also available in the US in limited numbers per year and sold at a premium of $2000 over the list. Audi factory numbers indicate that the B7 RS 4 saloon can accelerate from in 4.8 seconds, and arrive at in 16.6 seconds. Most European magazines recorded results in line with the November 2009 comparison of \\"ultimate sedans\\" in Road & Track, which recorded a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.5 seconds. This is consistent with the pattern of conservatism that is usually found in Audi's official performance numbers. For the Avant, is reached in 4.9 seconds.

Only the Audi RS6 had taken this similar route (saloon and Avant) before; the previous RS 4 and RS2 were available exclusively as Avants. Constructed from fully galvanised steel in a monocoque (unitary/unibody) design, the B7 RS 4 uses lightweight aluminium for its front wings (fenders) and bonnet (hood). The saloon version features a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31, from a frontal area of 2.17 m2. Like its B5 predecessor, visually, the B7 RS 4 differs from its related B7 S4, by having even wider flared front and rear wheel arches (fenders), to allow for a wider axle track. Over the B7 A4, it also includes two larger frontal side air intakes (for the two additional side-mounted coolant radiators). The trim on the saloon and roof rails on the estate are chrome as standard but can also be found in black with the addition of the Optic Pack which includes a black front grill, all exterior trim, and black roof rails on the estate version. The B7 RS 4 also includes an optional adaptive headlights to complement the standard \\"Xenon Plus\\" (Bi-Xenon) High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlamps, which swivel around corners in conjunction with steering wheel movements. Also standard are daytime running lights (DRLs), found within the main headlamp housings, identical to its related B7 A4 and S4, and use a conventional tungsten filament bulb. An acoustic parking system with front and rear sensors is also a standard fitment. Unique carbon fibre interior trims, along with a lap timer within the central Driver Information System (DIS), aluminium pedal caps and footrest, and RS 4 logos complete the look. In the saloon, luggage space, measured according to the VDA 'block method', is with the rear seats in the upright position, and with the seats folded flat (dependent on specification). For the Avant, is available with the seats upright (under the retractable load cover), and being available with the rear seats folded flat (loaded to the roofline). Kerb weight of the saloon variant starts at (dependent on specification). A Bose ten-speaker sound system, with 190 watt output and automatic dynamic noise compensation (which replaces the 'GALA' found on earlier units), with \\"Concert II\\" radio and single CD player is standard in car entertainment (ICE) equipment. Factory fitted ICE options to complement the standard BOSE include the \\"Symphony II\\" system which features twin radio tuners, a single-slot loading six-CD changer, and a cassette player all integrated into a double-DIN sized unit. Navigation option is the RNS-E \\"Audi Navigation System plus\\" DVD- ROM GPS satellite navigation, which includes a folding widescreen 6.5-inch screen, two SD-memory card readers, and MMI-like logic control. B7 interior safety To achieve maximum body stiffness with controlled deformation crumple zones, the B7 RS 4 features laser beam welding of major seams of the high-strength steel body shell, which helps improve overall structural rigidity, particularly in the \\"passenger cell\\", over traditional spot welding methods. Two-stage driver and front-seat passenger frontal airbags are standard, as is Audi's \\"side guard\\" head protection curtain airbag system. This latter system completely covers all of the side windows, from the front 'A pillar' to the rear \\"C-\\" or \\"D pillars\\". The body-hugging Recaro shell-type RS race bucket seats (not available in North American markets), complete with electrically inflatable upper and lower side bolsters and adjustable lumbar support, are constructed so as not to need lower side airbags to comply with European crash safety standards. In North America, the only front seats available are the more traditional Recaro seats (identical to those in the B6 and B7 S4), which include lower side airbags; these were also available as a no-cost option in other markets. Lower side airbags are optional for the standard-fit Recaro rear seats. Front and outer rear seatbelts include pyrotechnic belt pretensioners, whilst all belts include an excess load limit function. =B7 powertrain= The engine of the B7 RS 4 is based on the existing all-alloy V8 from the B6 S4, and shares many parts, and Fuel Stratified Injection, with the 4.2 FSI V8 engine in the Q7. The engine includes new cylinder block construction, and is a highly reworked, high- revving variant (redline at 8,000 rpm; rev limit of 8,250 rpm). The parts code and version is 079.D and the identification code is BNS. The same engine base was used for the Audi R8 when Audi wanted to build their first supercar. However, the camshaft drive system was moved to the front of the block for the mid-engine R8. The engine has increased crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return system and a baffled oil sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (making it \\"quad cam\\"), which are driven by roller chains with variable valve timingBosch Automotive Technology Variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98 RON (93 AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces at 7,800 rpm, giving it a specific power output of per litre. Based on a kerb weight of , this results in a power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kg. This engine also produces of torque at 5,500 rpm, 90 percent of which is available between 2,250 and 7,600 rpm. (Using lower 95 RON (91 AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI- MotronicBosch Automotive Technology DI-Motronic for direct gasoline injection MED 9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas'Bosch Automotive Technology Electronic throttle control (ETC/EGAS) for direct gasoline injection electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324 g/km. A 6-speed Getrag manual transmission (parts code: 0A3, identification codes: HLD, JMH) is the only transmission available. The gear ratios are 1st: 3.667, 2nd: 2.211, 3rd: 1.520, 4th: 1.133, 5th: 0.919, 6th: 0.778. The Audi B7 RS 4 was the only \\"RS\\" Audi powered by a naturally aspirated engine until the Audi RS5 was presented at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The RS5 also uses a 4.2-litre high revving V8. The RS5 also dropped the Getrag 6-speed manual in favour of a 7-speed \\"S-Tronic\\" dual clutch automatic. =quattro= Another focus of the B7 RS 4 was on the introduction of the latest development of Audi's 'trademark' quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. This utilised the 'third generation' asymmetric/dynamic Torsen T-3 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential, featuring a 'default' 40:60 front-to-rear torque split under normal conditions. Audi stressed that this would result in a more neutral response in corners and a more dynamic driving experience. Also, a more aggressive Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) was used, and set to 4:1, as opposed to 2:1 (and later variants 3:1 TBR) on standard A4.https://www.hstuning.com/jhm-4-1-center-differential-upgrade.html That means that one side of the differential can handle up to 80%, while the other side would have to only handle 20% of applied torque. Front and rear axle differentials are conventional \\"open\\" types, with a final drive ratio of 4.111. Traction is assisted by way of Audi's \\"Electronic Differential Lock\\" (EDL), which is a specific function of the Robert Bosch GmbH ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme system. EDL monitors the rotational speeds of the left and right wheels across an individual axle, and if one wheel should rotate faster than the other (exceeding the pre-defined parameters), indicating loss of traction, or \\"wheel spin\\" on one wheel, the EDL applies the brakes to that individual spinning wheel, and thus results in transferring torque across the open differential to the wheel on the other side deemed to have grip, hence traction. Also included in the ESP 8.0 is \\"Anti Slip Regulation\\" (ASR)—Audi's name for Traction Control System. The result of all these features is that under normal circumstances (driving straight on dry or even wet road surfaces) the car never loses traction, even when accelerating at full throttle in the first gear. =B7 suspension and steering= Audi B7 RS 4The B7 RS 4 also incorporates Audi's \\"Dynamic Ride Control\\" (DRC) \\"Sports Suspension\\" mechanism. The dampers (shock absorbers) are made for Audi by KW, and central reservoirs/valves made by KYB (Kayaba). In the RS 4 suspension, a fluid hydraulic linkage between diagonally opposing front and rear suspension dampers (left front to right rear, and vice versa) is used to counteract vehicle pitch and roll. Lightweight magnesium/aluminium alloy multi-link suspension arms (four arm with virtual steering axis up front, and trapezoidal arm with unequal length track control arms at the rear) locate each hub/brake/roadwheel assembly in a controllable fashion, whilst minimising unsprung masses. Lightweight hollow tubular anti-roll bars are standard front and rear. Compared to standard B7 A4 models, the RS 4 features a lower ride height. An optional \\"Sports Suspension Plus\\" lowers the car by a further , and marginally further stiffens the damper rates. Axle track has also been increased over standard A4s; the front widened by , to and the rear by to . Speed sensitive \\"servotronic\\" variable-assistance electro-hydraulic power assisted steering (PAS) is controlled from a compact flat-bottomed steering wheel, finished in perforated leather with mock-aluminium trim. The steering rack ratio is 13.1:1, and the turning circle is . =B7 brakes, wheels and tyres= The standard brakes on the RS 4 are of two-piece construction. The cast-iron discs are cross-drilled and radially ventilated and float on aluminium alloy disc hubs. The two-piece disc construction reduces unsprung mass and also reduces the transmission of heat generated by the brakes to the wheel bearings. The front discs are in diameter and thick, and use gloss black Brembo monoblock eight-opposed-piston fixed calipers from the Lamborghini Gallardo but with Red/Silver 'RS 4' logos. These and the transmission are supplied with a cooling airflow directed from NACA ducts located in the engine front undertray. The rear brakes are drilled, vented and floating by iron discs, with gloss black Lucas-Girling TRW single piston floating calipers with an integrated mechanical handbrake mechanism. A lighter and more performant \\"Audi ceramic\\" front brake system was an option from 2007 model year onwards (and only with 19 inch wheels). It comprised cross-drilled, radially vented and floating Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) composite SGL Carbon discs, diameter and thick, with grey Brembo monoblock six-opposed- piston fixed aluminium alloy calipers. The discs have a much greater tolerance to thermal differences, virtually eliminating brake fade, and have a duration of five times greater than conventional iron discs. The ceramic brakes also reduce unsprung mass by around 50% and thereby improve steering response and overall handling. A specifically 'tuned' \\"sport-biased\\" BoschBosch Automotive Technology Electronic Stability Programme ESP ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme is standard, and includes Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), and Brake Assist (BA). This ESP system has three user-selectable settings: the standard default full protection mode, increased slip mode (which turns off the ASR and EDL), and ESP fully off. A useful feature of the ESP 8.0 is 'disc wiping', whereby in wet weather the ESP system applies the brakes frequently but momentarily. This removes water from the disc and pad surfaces, and helps to maintain the braking performance of dry weather. This operation is undetectable by the driver. In the UK and Japan, the standard wheels are 19 inch alloy wheels () with (eXtraLoad) high performance tyres. This 19\\" wheel and tyre package was an option for the North American, and some European markets. Factory supplied tyres included Continental SportContact 3, Michelin Pilot Sport PS2, or Pirelli P-Zero Rosso – although many owners have questioned the load-carrying abilities of the Pirellis (from unexplained sidewall failures and dubious dynamic stability), opting for the more durable Michelins at replacement time. A no-cost option of 18 inch alloy wheels () with tyres was also available, and these are standard in North American markets. A winter wheel and tire package was also available as an option, and included Dunlop SP WinterSport 3D tyres. A direct-acting Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is standard fitment. This system monitors the pressure in all four tyres every three seconds, and when any loss in pressure is detected, audible and visual warnings are given to alert the driver via the Driver Information System (DIS) in a timely manner. =Other B7 notable features= Other notable features to be found as standard equipment on cars for non-North American markets are the smaller, flat bottomed steering wheel (complete with \\"Sport\\" button) again selected from the VAG parts bin from the Lamborghini Gallardo like the brakes, however a standard 'multifunction' steering wheel was a no-cost option, body-hugging Recaro shell-type race bucket seats complete with electrically inflatable upper and lower side bolsters. =B7 crash testing= The North American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash-tested the B7 RS 4's sibling, the B7 A4, and awarded it \\"Double Best Pick\\" for frontal and side crashes—beating illustrious rivals such as the BMW 3 Series, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, however at the 2012 session of the SOT (small overlap test ) the A4 was rated Poor, rating applying up to the 2016 MY. () http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/audi/a4-4-door-sedan =B7 awards= The Audi RS 4 won Top Gear's Most Surprising Car of the Year in 2005. In 2007, the Audi RS 4 was the winner in the \\"World Performance Car\\" category of the International World Car of the Year (WCOTY). B8 (2012-2015)  The Audi RS 4 Avant quattro was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show and was based on the B8 A4 Avant. The RS 4 Avant uses the Volkswagen MLB platform, and shares the same powertrain as the RS 5 Coupé. =B8 bodywork and styling= Compared to the related B8 S4, the RS 4 features larger bumper air dams and features double exhaust tailpipes compared to the S4's double twin (quadruple) exhaust tailpipes. Wider arches allow for a wider axle and wheels. A completely remodelled front bumper cover with honeycomb grill compared to the standard A4 and S4 as well as remodelled rear bumper with honeycomb detailing and minor air diffuser. The interior is largely the same but the flat-bottom steering wheel is covered entirely in perforated leather with RS badging on the steering wheel and gear stick. The interior dashboard and door liners are also detailed with carbon fibre inserts as standard although there were options to change this to aluminium or piano black. SuperSport seats covered partly with leather part Alcantara were standard in the B8 RS 4 but as with the B7, there was a winged backed bucket seat option. It was also an option to order the seats covered entirely with leather. =B8 powertrain= The RS 4 is powered by a 4.2L FSI V8 engine producing 450ps and 430Nm of torque allowing the car to accelerate from in 4.7 seconds. The RS 4 Avant is available with a 7-speed dual-clutch S-Tronic transmission. =B8 brakes, wheels and tires= New for the B8 are 'wavy' vented and floating cast iron discs, diameter and thick, with 6-pot Brembo floating calipers, and at the rear by discs with a single-piston floating calliper. The standard wheels were 19 inch alloys with 235/40 R19 Pirelli P-Zero performance tyres. Optional 20\\" rotor design or 10 spoke alloy wheels were also available with 265/35 R20 Pirelli P-Zero tyres. =Other B8 notable features= Amongst the options available for the B8 RS 4, are ceramic brakes, allowing the car to perform heavy braking without having brake fade. A sports pack was available which included Sports exhaust identifiable by black exhaust tips in the rear bumper, Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) suspension. The Sports pack also came with the 20\\" rotor design wheels as standard. The sports exhaust, DRC suspension setting, steering, engine response, engine mapping, and exhaust note are all adjustable using the 'Drive Select' feature which is a button on either the centre console or through the MMI display interface. Settings that can be selected are Comfort, Auto, Dynamic, or Individual with the Individual setting allowing the driver to select any of comfort, auto, or dynamic for a number of handling and performance options. A Sound pack was also an option, the main feature being that of the Bang and Olufsen speaker system, uprated from the standard Audi sound system. The Bang & Olufsen system includes 14 speakers and sub- woofers producing 500W. A total of 7000 units of the Audi B8 RS 4 were built. = Nogaro Limited Edition = In February 2014, Audi announced a tribute to the original RS 2 Avant on its 20th anniversary by releasing a limited run of the Nogaro Limited Edition. The changes were entirely cosmetic with red brake callipers and blue Alcantara detailed interior (seats, door lining, blue carbon weave elements & blue stitching) as well as the limited edition Nogaro Blue paint exterior.2014 Geneva Motor Show.alt= B9 (2018–present)  The new RS 4 Avant was unveiled at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. Noticeable changes to the B9 included a more angular exterior and newly designed wheels. The new RS 4 Avant is powered with a 2.9 TFSI V6 twin-turbo engine producing 450ps and 600Nm of torque. Unlike the B8, RS 4 which had a 7-speed dual-clutch S-Tronic transmission, the new RS 4 Avant is available with an 8-speed \\"Tiptronic' automatic transmission. Rear Motorsport =Speed World Challenge= The B7 RS 4 was planned to replace the C5 RS6 in the SCCA Speed World Challenge, but after Champion Racing had prepared the car, it was decided not to compete in the series, due to rule changes imposed by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) on Audi concerning 4WD systems, wheels size, and engine power output. Rather than scrapping the fully built Speed World Challenge RS 4, Champion and Audi used the car as a part of the American Le Mans Series Vitesse Program, which highlights the technology link between race cars and conventional series production road cars. =Euro Superstars= Six RS 4s are openly campaigned in the Superstars Series by Audi Sport Italia. Audi RS 4 Quattro driver Gianni Morbidelli won the 2007 and 2008 championships.

C. Boyle first published in 2004 about the development of sexology in the United States and about Alfred Kinsey's rise to fame during the late 1940s and early 1950s as seen through the eyes of one of his loyal assistants. This assistant, however, John Milk, is a fictional character rather than a historical person. Boyle makes it unmistakably clear in the \\"Author’s Note\\" that The Inner Circle \\"is a work of fiction, and [that] all characters and situations have been invented, with the exception of the historical figures of Alfred C. Kinsey and his wife, Clara Bracken (McMillen) Kinsey\\". Plot introduction The Inner Circle revolves around the tensions that are bound to arise if a small group of people deliberately abandons the traditional moral values with which they were raised in favour of an unconventional outlook on love, marriage and sex. While Kinsey preaches that sex is nothing but a \\"hormonal function\\" devoid of emotion, John Milk has extreme difficulty adjusting to this concept where his own wife — the young and beautiful Iris — is concerned. Plot summary Milk's sexual coming of age starts in 1939 when he is a student at Indiana University in Bloomington and attends Kinsey’s “marriage course”, a lecture in which the renowned zoologist propounds his theories and his plans for the first time in front of a large audience. Still a virgin, he makes Kinsey’s acquaintance when the latter interviews him in order to take his “sex history”. Kinsey makes Milk his personal assistant despite his inexperience, but he turns out to be a quick learner, and thus the young man becomes the first member of what will be “the inner circle”: a handful of men (and, up to a point, also their wives) who furiously collaborate under Kinsey’s dictatorial rule towards the publication of the two volumes later referred to as the Kinsey Report. Characters in The Inner Circle *Alfred Kinsey – Professor conducting studies of sex at college Milk attends *Clara Bracken Kinsey – Alfred's wife *John Milk – Kinsey's assistant and protagonist *Iris Milk – John's wife Literary significance and criticism While the novel garnered generally favorable reviews, some reviewers and readers consider The Inner Circle to be one of Boyle’s lesser novels. The criticisms generally cite slow-moving and somewhat predictable plotting, as well as an overly-linear storyline. The German translation of the novel bears the more lurid title Dr. Sex.

In the various short stories, Hardy writes of the true nature of nineteenth-century marriage and its inherent restrictions, the use of grammar as a diluted form of thought, the disparities created by the role of class status in determining societal rank, the stance of women in society and the severity of even minor diseases causing the rapid onset of fatal symptoms prior to the introduction of sufficient medicinal practices. A focal point of all the short stories is that of social constraints acting to diminish one's contentment in life, necessitating unwanted marriages, repression of true emotion and succumbing to melancholia due to constriction within the confines of 19th-century perceived normalcy. Contents Published in 1888, Wessex Tales contained five stories (\\"The Three Strangers\\", \\"The Withered Arm\\", \\"Fellow-Townsmen\\", \\"Interlopers at the Knap\\", and \\"The Distracted Preacher\\") all published first in periodicals. For the 1896 reprinting, Hardy added \\"An Imaginative Woman\\", but in 1912 he moved this to another collection, Life's Little Ironies, while at the same time transferring two of that collection's stories — \\"A Tradition of Eighteen Hundred and Four\\" and \\"The Melancholy Hussar of the German Legion\\" — to Wessex Tales. TV and Film Adaptations Six of the short stories were adapted as television dramas, forming the BBC2 anthology series Wessex Tales: * \\"The Withered Arm\\" (7 November 1973, BBC2), adapted by Rhys Adrian, directed by Desmond Davis (The Internet Movie Database claims Davis is uncredited - this is an error) and starring Billie Whitelaw. * \\"Fellow-Townsmen\\" (14 November 1973, BBC2), adapted by Douglas Livingstone, directed by Barry Davis, and starring Jane Asher. * \\"A Tragedy of Two Ambitions\\" (21 November 1973, BBC2), adapted by Dennis Potter, directed by Michael Tuchner, and starring John Hurt. * \\"An Imaginative Woman\\" (28 November 1973, BBC2), adapted by William Trevor, directed by Gavin Millar, and starring Claire Bloom. * \\"The Melancholy Hussar\\" (5 December 1973, BBC2), adapted by Ken Taylor, directed by Mike Newell, and starring Ben Cross. * \\"Barbara of the House of Grebe\\" (12 December, 1973 BBC2), adapted by David Mercer, directed by David Jones, and starring Nick Brimble and Ben Kingsley.

It is a hydroxy ketone attached to two phenyl groups. It appears as off-white crystals, with a light camphor-like odor. Benzoin is synthesized from benzaldehyde in the benzoin condensation. It is chiral and it exists as a pair of enantiomers: (R)-benzoin and (S)-benzoin. Benzoin is not a constituent of benzoin resin obtained from the benzoin tree (Styrax) or tincture of benzoin. The main component in these natural products is benzoic acid. History Benzoin was first reported in 1832 by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Woehler during their research on oil of bitter almond, which is benzaldehyde with traces of hydrocyanic acid. The catalytic synthesis by the benzoin condensation was improved by Nikolay Zinin during his time with Liebig. Uses The main uses of benzoin are as a precursor to benzil, which is a photoinitiator.Hardo Siegel, Manfred Eggersdorfer \\"Ketones\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, 2002 by Wiley-VCH, Wienheim. The conversion proceeds by organic oxidation using copper(II), nitric acid, or oxone. In one study, this reaction is carried out with atmospheric oxygen and basic alumina in dichloromethane.

He is referred to as being one of the founders of modern rocketry and astronautics, along with the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the German Hermann Oberth, and the American Robert H. Goddard.  Biography  He was born on November 8, 1881 in Paris to a textile industrialist. He was educated at the Faculté des Sciences, studying engineering at the Sorbonne. He served in World War I and was made an Officier de la Légion d'Honneur. In November, 1928, on board the Ile de France while sailing to New York City, he was married to Carmen Bernaldo de Quirós, the daughter of Don Antonio and Yvonne Cabarrus, and granddaughter of General Marquis of Santiago, Grandee of Spain, Head of the Military Household of Queen Isabella II. He died on December 6, 1957 in Nice, France.  REP  Esnault- Pelterie developed and manufactured aeroplanes and aero engines under the name REP. =Aeroplanes= His first experiments in aviation were based on the Wright brothers 1902 glider. His first glider design was tested on a beach near Calais, but was not successful. His glider was based upon an incomplete understanding of the Wright glider, and although using a version of the wing- warping which the Wright brothers had used to control their aircraft this did not work properly and was abandoned, since he considered it dangerous.Gibbs- Smith 1974 p.128 After condemning the Wright brothers' approach, he developed the concept of the aileron, fitting a pair of mid-gap control surfaces in front of the wings. Esnault-Pelterie airplane 1908. In 1906 he began his first experiments in towed flight. On 19 September 1906 he flew . He made his first powered flight on October 10, 1907, a distance of with the REP 1. This was driven by a seven-cylinder, 30 hp air-cooled engine of his own design. Avion Esnault-Pelterie, 1908 Trials of the monoplane REP 2 began on June 8, 1908. This aircraft set a record with a flight, reaching an altitude of . After a modified version of this plane was flown for the last time in 1909 at Rheims, Pelterie stopped flying and instead focused on the development and manufacture of aircraft. The Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane was based upon his designs, and marked the beginning of aircraft production at the later Vickers Limited. In 1912 he introduced the REP Type N and in 1914 the REP Parasol monoplane. The wing structure of the R.E.P Type D Monoplane, 1911. His family had invested heavily to fund his aircraft designs, and this had left them nearly financially ruined. However, he was the inventor of the \\"joystick\\" flight control, and owned a patent on the design. Following the war he was involved in litigation over his joystick patent. Many aircraft built during the war had used this design and the aircraft companies owed him royalties. The damages he won and subsequent royalties made him a wealthy man. This also allowed him to repay his father's significant investment. =Aero engines= Esnault-Pelterie designed and built his own aero engines. He also sold them under the name R.E.P. They were all of an unusual multiple-banked fan or half-radial type. The first design featured seven cylinders double-banked, with four in one bank and three in the other, and was rated at . A later model doubled them up to create a 14 cylinder quadruple-banked engine giving .Gunston, W,; World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines, 4th Edition, Patrick Stephens Ltd, 1998.Jane, F.T.; Jane's All the World's Airships 1909, Sampson Low Marston, 1909, pp.346-347.  Rocketry  He became interested in space travel, and, not knowing of Tsiolkovsky's 1903 work, in 1913 produced a paper that presented the rocket equation and calculated the energies required to reach the Moon and nearby planets.\\"Considerations sur les resultats d'un allegement indefini des moteurs\\", Journal de physique theorique et appliquee, Paris, 1913 In this talk, he proposed the use of atomic energy, using 400 kg of radium to power an interplanetary vehicle. His culminating work was L'Astronautique, published in 1930. A later version published in 1934 included details on interplanetary travel and applications of nuclear power. On June 8, 1927, Esnault-Pelterie gave a symposium for the Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society) titled L'exploration par fusées de la très haute atmosphère et la possibilité des voyages interplanétaires, concerning the exploration of outer space using rocket propulsion. Jean-Jacques Barré attended this lecture, and developed a correspondence with Esnault-Pelterie on the topic of rockets. In 1929 Esnault-Pelterie proposed the idea of the ballistic missile for military bombardment. By 1930, Esnault-Pelterie and Barré had persuaded the French War Department to fund a study of the concept. In 1931, the two began experimenting with various types of rocket propulsion systems, including liquid propellants. The same year he ran a demonstration of a rocket engine powered with gasoline and liquid oxygen. During an experiment with a rocket design using tetra-nitromethane he lost four fingers from his right hand during an explosion. Ultimately, their work failed to create an interest in rocketry within France.

Although osteoclasts are active during the natural formation of healthy bone the term \\"osteolysis\\" specifically refers to a pathological process. Osteolysis often occurs in the proximity of a prosthesis that causes either an immunological response or changes in the bone's structural load. Osteolysis may also be caused by pathologies like bone tumors, cysts, or chronic inflammation. Joint replacement While bone resorption is commonly associated with many diseases or joint problems, the term osteolysis generally refers to a problem common to artificial joint replacements such as total hip replacements, total knee replacements and total shoulder replacements. Osteolysis can also be associated with the radiographic changes seen in those with bisphosphonate- related osteonecrosis of the jaw. There are several biological mechanisms which may lead to osteolysis. In total hip replacement, the generally accepted explanation for osteolysis involves wear particles (worn off the contact surface of the artificial ball and socket joint). As the body attempts to clean up these wear particles (typically consisting of plastic or metal), it triggers an autoimmune reaction which causes resorption of living bone tissue. Osteolysis has been reported to occur as early as 12 months after implantation and is usually progressive. This may require a revision surgery (replacement of the prosthesis). Although osteolysis itself is clinically asymptomatic, it can lead to implant loosening or bone breakage, which in turn causes serious medical problems. Distal clavicular osteolysis Distal clavicular osteolysis (DCO) is often associated with problems weightlifters have with their acromioclavicular joints due to high stresses put on the clavicle as it meets with the acromion. This condition is often referred to as \\"weight lifter's shoulder\\". Medical ultrasonography readily depicts resorption of the distal clavicle as irregular cortical erosions, whereas the acromion remains intact.Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Sample chapter available at ShoulderUS.com Associated findings may include distended joint capsule, soft-tissue swelling, and joint instability. A common surgery to treat recalcitrant DCO is re-sectioning of the distal clavicle, removing a few millimetres of bone from the very end of the bone.

Today the Gros Ventre people are enrolled in the Fort Belknap Indian Community of the Fort Belknap Reservation of Montana, a federally recognized tribe with 3,682 enrolled members, that also includes Assiniboine people or Nakoda people, the Gros Ventre's historical enemies. The Fort Belknap Indian Reservation is in the northernmost part of Montana, just south of the small town of Harlem, Montana.

Edited by Stephen S. Witte & Marsha V. Gallagher. Volume 2, page 443 n. 37 (footnote provided by Allan R. Taylor). Norman: University of Oklahoma Press. The French used the term Gros Ventre, which was mistakenly interpreted from their sign language. They were once known as the Gros Ventres of the Prairies, while the Hidatsa people were once called the Gros Ventres of the Missouri. The Piegan Blackfoot, enemies of the Gros Ventre throughout most of history, called the Aaniiih, \\"Piik-siik-sii-naa\\", which translates as \\"snakes\\". According to the Piegan Institute, the contemporary Piegan name for the Gros Ventre is \\"Assinee\\", meaning \\"big bellies\\", which is similar to the falsely translated label applied by the French. Atsina, a Pieagan word, translates to either \\"gut people\\" or \\"like a Cree\\". Further clarification of the name is required. After the division of peoples, their relations the Arapaho, who considered them inferior, called them Hitúnĕna, meaning \\"beggars\\".\\"Canadian Indian Tribes.\\" Access Genealogy. (retrieved 1 Nov 2011) Other interpretations of the term have been \\"hunger\\", \\"waterfall\\", and \\"big bellies\\". History The Gros Ventres are believed to have lived in the western Great Lakes region 3000 years ago, where they lived an agrarian lifestyle, cultivating maize.Pritzker 297 With the ancestors of the Arapaho, they formed a single, large Algonquian- speaking people who lived along the Red River valley in northern present-day Minnesota and in Manitoba, Canada. They were closely associated with the ancestors of the Cheyenne. They spoke the now nearly extinct Gros Ventre language (Atsina), a similar Plains Algonquian language like their kin the Arapaho and grouped therefore as an Arapahoan language (Arapaho-Atsina). There is evidence that, together with bands of Northern Arapaho, a southern tribal group, the Staetan, spoke the Besawunena dialect, which had speakers among the Northern Arapaho as recently as the late 1920s. =18th century= In the early 18th century, the large tribe split into two, forming the Gros Ventres and the Arapaho. These, with the Cheyenne, were among the last to migrate into Montana, due to pressure from the Ojibwe. After they migrated to Montana, the Arapaho moved southwards to the Wyoming and Colorado area. The Cheyenne who migrated with the Gros Ventre and Arapaho also migrated onwards. The Gros Ventres were reported living in two north-south tribal groups - the so-called Fall Indians (Canadian or northern group) of 260 tipis (2,500 population) traded with the North West Company on the Upper Saskatchewan River and roamed between the Missouri and Bow River, and the so-called Staetan tribe (American or southern group) of 40 tipis (400 population) living in close contact with bands (which would become the later Northern Arapaho) and roamed the headwaters of the Loup branch of the North Platte River (Lewis and Clark 1806).Loretta Fowler: Shared Symbols, Contested Meanings: Gros Ventre Culture and History, 1778-1984, , Cornell University Press, page 45] The Gros Ventres acquired horses in the mid-18th century. The earliest known contact of Gros Ventres with settlers was around 1754, between the north and south forks of the Saskatchewan River. Exposure to smallpox severely reduced their numbers about this time. Around 1793, in response to attacks by well-armed Cree and Assiniboines, large groups of Gros Ventres burned two Hudson's Bay Company trading posts that were providing guns to the Cree and Assiniboine tribes in what is now Saskatchewan. =19th century= In 1832, the Gros Ventres made contact with the German explorer and naturalist, Prince Maximilian. Along with the naturalist painter Karl Bodmer, the Europeans painted portraits and recorded their meeting with the Gros Ventres, near the Missouri River in Montana. Camp of the Gros Ventres of the Prairies on the upper Missouri. (circa 1832): aquatint by Karl Bodmer from the book \\"Maximilian, Prince of Wied’s Travels in the Interior of North America, during the years 1832–1834\\" The Gros Ventres joined the Blackfoot Confederacy. After allying with the Blackfoot, the Gros Ventres moved to north-central Montana and southern Canada. In 1855, Isaac Stevens, Governor of the Washington Territory, concluded a treaty (Stat., L., XI, 657) to provide peace between the United States and the Blackfoot, Flathead and Nez Perce tribes. The Gros Ventres signed the treaty as part of the Blackfoot Confederacy, whose territory near the Three Fork area became a common hunting ground for the Flathead, Nez Perce, Kootenai, and Crow Indians. A common hunting ground north of the Missouri River on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation included the Assiniboine and Sioux. In 1861, the Gros Ventres left the Blackfoot Confederacy.Pritzker 303 Allying with the Crow, the Gros Ventres fought the Blackfoot but in 1867, they were defeated. In 1868, the United States government established a trading post called Fort Browning near the mouth of Peoples Creek on the Milk River. This trading post was built for the Gros Ventres and Assiniboines, but because it was on a favorite hunting ground of the Sioux, it was abandoned in 1871. The government then built Fort Belknap, which was established on the south side of the Milk River, about one mile southwest of the present town site of Harlem, Montana. Fort Belknap was a substation post, with half of the structure being a trading post. A block house stood to the left of the stockade gate. At the right was a warehouse and an issue building, where the tribe received their rations and annuity goods. In 1876, the fort was discontinued and the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine people receiving annuities at the post were instructed to go to the agency at Fort Peck and Wolf Point. The Assiniboines did not object to going to Wolf Point and readily went about moving; but the Gros Ventres refused to go. If they did, they would come into contact with the Sioux, with whom they could not ride together in peace. They forfeited their annuities rather than move to Fort Peck. In 1878, the Fort Belknap Agency was re-established, and the Gros Ventres, and remaining Assiniboines were again allowed to receive supplies at Fort Belknap. White Eagle, \\"the last major Chief of the Gros Ventre people\\", died \\"at the mouth of the Judith River\\" on February 9, 1881. Gros Ventre moving camp with travois. In 1884, gold was discovered in the Little Rocky Mountains. Pressure from miners and mining companies forced the tribes to cede sections of the mountains in 1885. Jesuits came to Fort Belknap in 1862 to convert the Gros Ventre people to Roman Catholicism. In 1887, St. Paul's Mission was established at the foot of the Little Rocky Mountains, near Hays. Much of the traditional ceremonies were lost through the course of time following the establishment of the mission. However, the two sacred pipes, The Feathered Pipe and The Flat Pipe, remain central to the traditional spiritual beliefs of the Gros Ventres. In 1888, at this site, the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation was established. By an act of Congress on May 1, 1888, (Stat., L., XXV, 113), the Blackfoot, Gros Ventre, and Assiniboine tribes ceded 17,500,000 acres of their joint reservation and agreed to live on three smaller reservations. These are now known as the Blackfoot Confederacy, the Fort Peck Indian Reservation and the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. Fort Belknap was named for William W. Belknap, who was Secretary of War at that time. =20th century= By 1904, there were only 535 A'ani tribe members remaining. Since then, the tribe has revived, with a substantial increase in population. =21st century= In March 2012, 63 American bison from Yellowstone National Park were transferred to the Fort Peck Indian Reservation prairie, to be released to a 2,100-acre game preserve 25 miles north of Poplar. There are many other bison herds outside Yellowstone, but this is one of the very few genetically pure ones, not cross-bred with cattle. Native Americans celebrated the move, which came over a century after bison were nearly wiped out by hunters and the government. The Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes at the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation will also receive a portion of this herd. Government Historically, Gros Ventres had twelve independent bands, each governed by a chief. The current reservation government has an elected council, which includes four officers, as well as four members from each tribe. Today, the tribe belongs to the Fort Belknap Indian Community, whose constitution and by-laws were ratified in 1935. The tribal council has six elected Gros Ventre members, as well as six elected Assiniboine members, and three appointed members.

The company is the largest television station owner in the United States, owning 197 television stations across the U.S., most of which are affiliates with the four \\"major\\" U.S. television networks. It also operates all of the stations owned by affiliated companies, such as Mission Broadcasting, Shield Media, and Vaughan Media, under local marketing agreements. History =1996–2010: Formation= The Nexstar Media Group was founded as the Nexstar Broadcasting Group on June 17, 1996. The first television station bought by Nexstar was WYOU in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Nexstar bought WYOU from Diversified Communications. The sale was completed on September 28 of that year.Application Search Details CDBS Public Access, Federal Communications Commission, Retrieved 12 March 2017. Nexstar promptly fired two beloved anchors and laid off several long-term staff members. Nexstar founder Perry Sook said that WYOU would be Nexstar's flagship station, keeping an office off the newsroom for years. In 1998, Nexstar purchased WBRE-TV in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Because this was in the same market as WYOU, WYOU was 'sold' to Mission Broadcasting. This began the first ever 'shared-services' agreement between stations. WYOU's sales staff was kept in Scranton while the production and news operations were moved to WBRE's offices in Wilkes-Barre. WYOU's staff who were not laid off were fired by Nexstar, hired by Mission and eventually rehired by Nexstar. Mission Broadcasting then paid Nexstar to operate and control the production and newsgathering operations while Mission kept the sales and management team. In 2003, Nexstar acquired Quorum Broadcasting (owner of 10 television stations). On March 20, 2009, Nexstar operated television stations that were owned by Four Points Media Group, through an outsourcing agreement. However, on September 8, 2011, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intent of purchasing the Four Points stations outright and took over the MSA for the stations that October upon Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval of the deal (the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gave final approval of the group deal on December 21, and the Sinclair purchase of the Four Points stations was completed on January 1, 2012). =2011–2013: Retransmission consent dispute with Fox= In 2011, Nexstar and Fox entered into a dispute over terms of reverse compensation; this occurred as Fox began to aggressively seek shares of earnings from retransmission consent agreements with cable and satellite operators as part of affiliation agreement renewals between station groups with affiliates whose affiliation contracts already expired (and carrying the network's programming without a contractual agreement) or were near expiration. Reportedly, the amount from retransmission consent fees from cable and satellite operators that Fox wanted its affiliates to pay the network would be 25 cents per subscriber during the first year of the affiliation agreement, increasing to 50 cents by the fourth year. President of affiliate sales and marketing for Fox, Mike Hopkins, had said earlier in the year that the network would consider moving its affiliation to another market station as a last resort if existing affiliates did not agree to the terms for reverse compensation retrans sharing. Fox dropped its affiliation from Nexstar-owned/managed stations in four markets, with three of the replacement stations adding Fox in addition to existing affiliations with the MyNetworkTV program service (owned by Fox parent company News Corporation). In Indiana, two markets saw Fox go from a primary affiliation of one station to joining an existing MyNetworkTV-affiliated digital subchannel of a competing Big Three station, with MyNetworkTV going to a secondary affiliation: in Evansville, Fox moved from WTVW (which then became an independent station and later joined The CW) to a MyNetworkTV-affiliated subchannel of CBS affiliate WEVV-TV on July 1, while in Fort Wayne, the Fox affiliation moved from WFFT-TV to a MyNetworkTV-affiliated subchannel of NBC affiliate WISE-TV on August 1. The network also moved its affiliation in Springfield, Missouri from KSFX-TV (operated in a duopoly with area CBS affiliate KOLR) to upstart MyNetworkTV affiliate KRBK on September 1, 2011, with both stations becoming independents. Nexstar chose to drop Fox from WFXW in Terre Haute, Indiana and re-affiliate with ABC on September 1, 2011 (becoming the only Nexstar station thus far to affiliate with another network following the removal of the Fox affiliation) as part of a long-term renewal agreement between Nexstar and ABC for the group's nine existing ABC stations, reversing a 1995 switch that saw Terre Haute losing over-the-air carriage of ABC programs (since then, ABC has been seen in the market via Indianapolis affiliate WRTV on area cable and satellite providers);\\"Nexstar's WFXW Switching From Fox To ABC,\\" from Broadcasting & Cable, 6/28/2011 the Fox affiliation then moved to a digital subchannel of CBS affiliate WTHI-TV which also added MyNetworkTV as a secondary affiliation. Nexstar's remaining Fox affiliates have since signed a renewal agreement through December 2013; in addition, following the settlement of Nexstar's antitrust lawsuit against WISE-TV's then-owner Granite Broadcasting, WFFT-TV reclaimed the Fox affiliation on March 1, 2013. Nexstar would purchase KRBK in late 2018, restoring its ownership of the Fox affiliation in the Springfield, Missouri market. =2012–2013: Expansion by acquisitions= In July 2012, Nexstar agreed to purchase 11 stations and Inergize Digital Media from Newport Television with two stations going to affiliate Mission Broadcasting. On April 24, 2013, Nexstar announced that it would acquire the entire group of Communications Corporation of America, KMSS-TV, KPEJ-TV, and most of the ComCorp-managed stations that are owned by White Knight Broadcasting would be sold to Mission Broadcasting while WEVV-TV and White Knight Broadcasting's KSHV-TV would be sold to a female-controlled company called Rocky Creek Communications, with Nexstar assuming operational control of those stations. On September 16, 2013, Nexstar announced that it would acquire WOI-DT, KCAU- TV, and WHBF-TV from Citadel Communications for $88 million. Nexstar immediately took over the stations' operations through a time brokerage agreement. The deal followed Phil Lombardo's decision to \\"slow down,\\" as well as a desire by Lynch Entertainment to divest its investments in WOI and WHBF; Citadel would continue to own KLKN, WLNE-TV, and its Sarasota properties. On March 5, 2014, the Federal Communications Commission approved the sale of these stations to Nexstar outright and the deal was completed on March 13. KCAU continued to use Citadel's standardized news sets, graphics and logos. On November 6, 2013, Nexstar announced that it would purchase the Grant Broadcasting stations for $87.5 million. Due to Federal Communications Commission ownership regulations, one of the stations, KLJB, was spun off to Marshall Broadcasting Group, but is operated by Nexstar through a shared services agreement. The sale was completed on December 1, 2014.Consummation Notice,CDBS Public Access Federal Communications Commission, Retrieved 3 December 2014. =2015–2017: Acquisition of Media General= On September 28, 2015, Nexstar announced that it presented an unsolicited offer to buy Media General for $4.1 billion (including debt). Per share, shareholders of Media General would receive $10.50 in cash and 0.0898 shares of Nexstar, a total equivalent of $14.50 per share. Nexstar's offer was seen by analysts as a maneuver to torpedo the merger of Media General with Meredith Corporation (announced on September 8). If Media General agreed to the counteroffer within a 20-day period, Nexstar would expand its portfolio to 114 television stations, pending spinoffs in markets where both own stations and federal approval. On November 16, Media General rejected the offer but agreed to negotiate after concluding its merge with Meredith. On January 27, 2016, Media General announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Nexstar in a deal valued at $17.14 per share, valuing the company at $4.6 billion plus the assumption of $2.3 billion debt. The combined company became known as Nexstar Media Group, and owns 171 stations, serving an estimated 39% of U.S. households. The company paid Meredith Corporation (whom Media General had previously proposed a merger with) a termination fee of $60 million and gave Meredith right of first refusal to acquire any broadcast or digital properties that may be divested during the purchase. The deal also included contingent value rights for Media General shareholders if it sold spectrum from its stations during the FCC's spectrum incentive auction. On May 27, 2016, Nexstar announced the sales of five stations. WCWJ in Jacksonville, Florida, along with WSLS-TV in Roanoke, Virginia, was sold to the Graham Media Group; and KADN-TV, as well as KLAF-LD in Lafayette, Louisiana, was sold to Bayou City Broadcasting, with KREG-TV in Glenwood Springs, Colorado going to Marquee Broadcasting as part of a series of divestitures required following Nexstar's acquisition of Media General due to Federal Communications Commission ownership caps (the sale of the Roanoke and Lafayette stations are required as Media General and Nexstar both own stations in those markets). On June 3, 2016, it was announced that Nexstar would spinoff WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin and KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa to Gray Television for $270 million. On June 13, 2016, Nexstar announced that it would sell WFFT in Fort Wayne, Indiana; KQTV in St. Joseph, Missouri; KIMT in Rochester, Minnesota; WTHI-TV in Terre Haute; and WLFI in Lafayette, Indiana to Heartland Media, through its USA Television MidAmerica Holdings joint venture with MSouth Equity Partners, for $115 million. The divestitures will allow Nexstar to comply with FCC ownership rules (specifically pertaining to national market coverage for station owners) in advance of the approval proceedings of the merger of both groups (Nexstar already owns NBC affiliate WTWO and operates ABC affiliate WAWV-TV in Terre Haute, and plans to acquire Media General-owned CBS affiliate WANE-TV in Fort Wayne). The transaction was approved by the FCC on January 11, 2017, and the sale was completed on January 17. =2014–2017: Other events= On March 13, 2014, Nexstar announced that it would purchase Internet Broadcasting, for $20 million. The company had also recently acquired competitor Inergize Digital through its purchase of assets from Newport Television, followed by Enterprise Technology Group, a spun-off joint venture between LIN Media and Fox Television Stations. The providers were merged to form Lakana, led by former ETG CEO Phillip Hyun. On February 2, 2015, Nexstar finalized its acquisition of Yashi, a location focused video advertising and programmatic technology company, for $33 million. On November 17, 2015, Nexstar announced its intent to purchase West Virginia Media Holdings' stations (WOWK-TV in Charleston, WBOY-TV in Clarksburg, WVNS-TV in Ghent, and WTRF-TV in Wheeling) for $130 million. The company took over the stations' non-license assets under a time brokerage agreement in December 2015 pending the formal completion of the deal, expected in late 2016. The two companies viewed the acquisition as being a complement to Nexstar's WHAG-TV, whose coverage area includes the Eastern Panhandle region. Nexstar CEO Perry A. Sook is an alumnus of WOWK. The sale was completed on January 31, 2017.Consummation Notice, CDBS Public Access, Federal Communications Commission, Retrieved 1 February 2017. =2017–2019: Merger with Tribune Media= On April 30, 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that there were competing bids for Tribune Media from Nexstar and a partnership between 21st Century Fox and private equity firm Blackstone Group. However, on May 8, 2017, it was announced that Tribune reached a deal to be acquired by Sinclair Broadcast Group. On May 26, 2017, it was reported by DealReporter that Nexstar may be considering a bid to acquire Tegna Inc., although such a deal would likely require significant divestments due to ownership conflicts and exceeding the ownership cap. On November 14, 2018, after Tribune cancelled its proposed sale to Sinclair, it was reported that Nexstar was a leading bidder to acquire Tribune. On December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced its intent to merge with Tribune Media for $6.4 billion ($4.1 billion for all of Tribune's shares in cash and $2.3 billion of Tribune's debt). The merger would give the company 216 stations in 118 markets, placing it just below the FCC's market cap of 39% of TV households and making it the largest owner of television stations in the United States. Nexstar plans to divest some stations and \\"non-core\\" assets as part of the merger. On March 20, 2019, Nexstar announced that it would divest 19 stations to the E. W. Scripps Company and Tegna Inc. for a total sum of $1.32 billion, with Scripps receiving eight stations (WPIX, WSFL-TV, WTKR and WGNT, WTVR-TV, WXMI, KSTU, and KASW), and Tegna eleven (WATN-TV and WLMT, WTIC-TV and WCCT- TV, WOI-DT and KCWI, WNEP, WPMT, WQAD-TV, WZDX, and KFSM-TV). The sale agreement for WPIX, however, includes a condition allowing Nexstar to buy it back between March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021. That station was valued at $75 million. Nexstar stated that these divestitures would be used to help fund the sale and cover debt. On April 3, 2019, Marshall Broadcasting Group sued Nexstar for breach of contract, alleging that the company was trying to \\"undermine\\" its operations so it could buy back the stations at a later date and lower cost in the present regulatory environment. The company also accused Nexstar of using the divestiture of stations to a minority-owned broadcaster as a token to gain FCC approval for the associated acquisitions. A carriage dispute with AT&T; resulted in the removal of more than 120 Nexstar stations across 97 markets from AT&T;'s DirecTV, DirecTV Now and U-verse platforms, which began at 11:59 p.m. on July 3, 2019 and ended on August 29, 2019. On August 1, 2019, the United States Department of Justice approved the deal between Nexstar Media Group and Tribune Media. The merger was approved by the FCC on September 16, and would be consummated three days later. On November 5, 2019, it was announced that Nexstar would acquire Fox Television Stations- owned WJZY and MyNetworkTV outlet WMYT-TV in Charlotte, North Carolina for $45 million. In turn, it also announced that it would sell its duopoly of Seattle- based KCPQ and KZJO (along with Milwaukee-based WITI) to FTS in a separate deal worth $350 million. Nexstar made the transactions to pay down debt and consolidate operations in the Southeast. The sale closed on March 2, 2020. = 2020: Launch of NewsNation = On January 15, 2020, Nexstar announced a national newscast called NewsNation on WGN America.

Their name is a reference to the titan Cronus, the father of Zeus in greek mythology. Lyrical subjects The lyrics of their songs are mainly about myths, legends and historical subjects from the ancient civilizations of Rome, Greece and Egypt or from Scandinavia or even from old kingdoms belonging to barbarians.  History  Kronos was formed in 1994 in Thaon-les-Vosges (France) by Grams (14 years old), Marot (17 years old), Jeremy (17 years old) and Mike (13 years old). The band played at this point some Heavy-thrash-metal. Two years later Tems (19 years old) replaced Marot (guitar) and Kristof (18 years old) joins the band for the vocals. Kronos started then to play Death Metal music and recorded its first demo called Outrance. In 1999, Tom (20 years old) replaces Jéremy and the band is now definitely oriented towards 'Brutal Death Metal'. The following year the recording of a new demo Split Promo 2000 containing 4 titles is finalized. The long-awaited first album Titan's Awakening was released in 2001. This first edition of this album was produced by the band itself. The band has then been acclaimed by critics and got its first contract with the label Warpath Records (former Shockwave). A new edition of Titan's Awakening is released at the end of October the same year with a new cover designed by Deather (Angel Corpse, Gurkkhas, Vital Remains...) as well as a new graphical booklet. Richard (26 years old) replaces Tems and plays the lead guitar from 2003. The band signs a contract for two upcoming albums with the new Spanish label Xtreem music managed by Dave Rotten from the band Avulsed. The second album was released in 2004 and is named Colossal Titan Strife. The band toured Europe in 2005 promoting the album. The third album was released in April 2007 and is named The Hellenic Terror.

After the United States After leaving the United States, he went to Beirut. For unknown reasons, he also went to East Germany. When he came back to Saudi Arabia, Saudi authorities seized his passport because of his troubles abroad.

He joined a Kuwaiti delegation and lined up to meet the king. The king recognized his nephew and bent his head forward, so that the younger Faisal could kiss the king's head in a sign of respect. The prince took out a revolver from his robe and shot the King twice in the head. His third shot missed and he threw the gun away. King Faisal fell to the floor. Bodyguards with swords and submachine guns arrested the prince. The king was quickly rushed to a hospital but doctors were unable to save him.

Wearing white robes and blindfolded, Faisal was beheaded with a single sweep of a gold-handled sword. =Motives= Aside from the death of his brother, other motives have been proposed. Beirut newspapers claimed involvement with drugs as a motivation in the assassination. Saudi officials began to state that the prince's actions were deliberate and planned. Rumours suggested that the prince had told his mother about his assassination plans, who in turn told King Faisal who responded that \\"if it is Allah's will, then it would happen\\". Arab media implied that the prince had been a tool of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Israeli's Mossad. Beirut newspapers offered three different explanations for the attack. An- Nahar reported that the attack may have been possible vengeance for the dethroning of King Saud, because Faisal was scheduled to marry Saud's daughter—Princess Sita—in the same week.Motives for Slaying Offered The Daily News, p. 5. 27 March 1975.

Al Bayrak reported that according to reliable Saudi sources, King Faisal prohibited him from leaving the country because of his excessive consumption of alcohol and other drugs and the attack may have been a retaliation against the ban.

Originally for cello and piano, the piece was later orchestrated by Fauré. The work, in C minor, features a sad and sombre opening and climaxes with an intense, tempestuous central section, before the return of the elegiac opening theme. Composition In 1880, having completed his First Piano Quartet, Fauré began work on a cello sonata. It was his frequent practice to compose the slow movement of a work first, and he did so for the new sonata. The completed movement was probably premiered at the salon of Camille Saint-Saëns in June 1880. The movement, like the quartet, is in the key of C minor. Whether the rest of the sonata would have been in that key is unknown: Fauré never completed it, and in January 1883 the slow movement was published as a stand-alone piece under the title Élégie. The first performance of the work under its new title was given at the Société Nationale de Musique in December 1883 by the composer and the cellist Jules Loeb to whom the piece is dedicated.Nectoux, p. 535 The Élégie was a great success from the outset, and the conductor Édouard Colonne asked Fauré for a version for cello and orchestra. Fauré agreed, and that version was premiered at the Société Nationale in April 1901, with Pablo Casals as soloist and the composer as conductor. Musical structure The piece is in the AABA CC trans D AC'C'coda form, in which the musical material of the beginning returns to close the piece after a contrasting middle section. The opening is a sombre, long- breathed melody. The cello carries the main thematic material, with piano providing a harmonically varied accompaniment. In the major-key middle section the piano bears the melodic theme before it passes to the cello. The middle section ends with a forceful passage in which the piano and cello exchange vehement themes. The dynamics remain loud as the first section returns, but the quiet sombreness of the opening soon takes over. The repeated opening theme is matched with some of the rhythmic features carried over from the middle section. The work ends in an atmosphere of calm.Nectoux, pp. 88–89 The orchestral version of the work requires two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns and strings to accompany the cellist. The Fauré specialist Jean-Michel Nectoux writes that the Élégie was one of the last works in which the composer allowed himself \\"such a direct expression of pathos\\". Nectoux regards the piece as \\"one of the last manifestations of French musical Romanticism. From now on Fauré's music was to be more introverted and discreet.\\"Nectoux, p. 89 Notes and references ;Notes ;References ;Sources * External links * Category:1883 compositions Category:Compositions by Gabriel Fauré Category:Compositions for cello and orchestra ","title":"Élégie (Fauré)"},{"id":"1969294","text":"Mother, Jugs & Speed is a 1976 American black comedy film directed by Peter Yates. It stars Bill Cosby (Mother), Raquel Welch (Jugs), Harvey Keitel (Speed), and Larry Hagman as employees of an independent ambulance service trying to survive in Los Angeles. Plot The F+B Ambulance Company is locked in an intense battle with the Unity Ambulance Company to win a city contract for providing ambulance service to a territory within Los Angeles. Their star driver is \\"Mother\\" Tucker (Bill Cosby), a talented antihero who drinks alcohol on duty, harasses nuns, and behaves brazenly towards practically everybody he meets, including his partner Leroy (Bruce Davison). Indeed, the entire company is a band of misfits, including the hypersexual John Murdoch (Larry Hagman), his partner Walker (Michael McManus), putative medical student Bliss (Allan Warnick), and brash Texan \\"Rodeo\\" Moxey (Dick Butkus). Handling calls at the switchboard is Jennifer (Raquel Welch), whom the drivers nickname \\"Jugs\\" for her ample bosom. Harry \\"Doughnut\\" Fishbine (Allen Garfield) runs the company, using occasionally underhanded means (such as kickbacks) to maintain an income stream. When Walker is injured after falling through a staircase on a call, Harry Fishbine hires Tony Malatesta (Harvey Keitel), a disgraced sheriff's detective and former Vietnam War ambulance driver. Upon learning that Tony has been suspended from the sheriff force due to allegations that he sold cocaine to children, Mother nicknames him \\"Speed\\". Speed is initially paired with Murdoch, though their partnership is strained when Speed must stop Murdoch from raping an unconscious female college student who has overdosed on Seconal. On a false emergency call, Leroy is shot and killed by a junkie (Toni Basil) demanding drugs. When Mother pulls a gun on the junkie, the junkie commits suicide. Later that night, a drunken Mother assaults Murdoch for stating that Leroy's death \\"doesn't count\\"; though Murdoch states this in regard to the drivers' \\"dead body\\" pool, Mother perceives it as an attack on the character of his dead partner. Harry then partners Speed with Mother to alleviate his driver shortage. Meanwhile, Jugs has obtained her Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and ambulance driver certifications, and forces her way onto F+B's active roster with threats of sexual discrimination lawsuits. When Speed fakes an injury to prevent Jugs' arrest for misuse of an ambulance, the two fall in love. Though Jugs proves a capable EMT, she loses her nerve after a pregnant woman under her care suffers a severe obstetrical hemorrhage and bleeds to death in Mother's ambulance. Jugs secludes herself afterward until Mother counsels her and gives her the courage to return to work. At a City Hall meeting, City Councilman Warren informs the owners of both Unity and F+B that they will not be awarded the contract—it will instead be awarded to a larger, established company. To save their businesses, Unity's owner, Charles Taylor, proposes that their two companies merge. Though the councilman is agreeable to the merger, Fishbine is not. The discussion is interrupted by an emergency call: Murdoch, intoxicated and armed with a handgun, has broken into F+B's bus garage office with Walker and is holding Mrs. Fishbine hostage. All of Unity's and F+B's ambulances descend on the F+B garage; upon arrival, Murdoch opens fire and hits Speed in the shoulder. When Mother charges onto the garage grounds to rescue his ambulance, he comes face to face with Murdoch; Murdoch tries to shoot Mother, but his gun is empty. A deputy sheriff then shoots and kills Murdoch. In the aftermath of this incident, F+B does merge with Unity, forming the Fishbine + Unity (F+U) Ambulance Company, based out of the old F+B garage. (The new acronym for the company is also a slang abbreviation of \\"fuck you\\"; the old F+B stood for \\"Fish + Bine\\".) Speed, who has been cleared of all charges, is reinstated to the police force, though he remains romantically involved with Jugs. Jugs is initially relegated to switchboard duty again, until Mother insists that she become his new partner. The two drive off together, with Mother harassing the nuns one more time as the movie ends.

TV version 20th Century Fox attempted to turn the film into a television series, although none of the original cast participated. The program was titled Mother, Juggs & Speed with a double \\"g\\" because the network would not allow the lead female character to have a name that made explicit reference to her breasts. Instead, producers added the concept that Jennifer's nickname was taken from her real last name, Juggston. The series was not picked up, but ABC aired the pilot as a one-time special on Thursday, August 17, 1978. Production Joseph Barbera, one half of the legendary cartoon-creating duo Hanna-Barbera, served as executive producer for this movie. Tom Mankiewicz says it was Barbera's idea to make a film about ambulance driving. He had a deal with 20th Century Fox who paid a writer to develop a script. Mankiewicz, then best known for writing several James Bond movies, became interested and was hired. He did research on the subject and wrote his own script, and then attached Peter Yates as director. Alan Ladd Jr., then head of production for Fox, said he would make the film if it could be done for less than $3 million. Yates and Mankiewicz thought the lead role of Mother Tucker was perfect for Gene Hackman and offered him the role but Hackman was exhausted from working on Lucky Lady and declined. However he recommended Bill Cosby as an alternative; Yates, Mankiewicz and Ladd all agreed and Cosby accepted the part. The tight budget meant the leads had to accept deferred payment. The female lead was offered to Valerie Perrine but she would not take deferred payment so Raquel Welch was cast instead.Tom Mankiewicz and Robert Crane, My Life as a Mankiewicz, University Press of Kentucky 2012 p170-174 Reception According to Tom Mankiewicz the film was made for around $3 million and grossed $17 million. Mother, Jugs & Speed was referenced in the 2006 film Relative Strangers multiple times, most notably during the game of Charades scene. Mother, Jugs & Speed was rated in M in New Zealand and Australia, where it was previously rated PG.

Sutherland, a Liberal, ran as a supporter of the province's Liberal-Progressive government. He was re-elected by acclamation in the 1941 election, and easily defeated a challenger from the CCF in 1945. From 1940 to 1950, Manitoba was governed by an alliance of Liberal-Progressives and Progressive Conservatives.

Other tree species include: *Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) *Red fir (Abies magnifica) *Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) *Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) *White fir (Abies concolor) *Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) =The Needles= The Needles are a series of granite spires atop a narrow ridge above the Kern River.()Mountain Project - The Needles =Wilderness areas= There are six wilderness areas within Sequoia NF that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Some of these extend into neighboring National Forests, as indicated. Two of them also extend into land that is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. * Domeland Wilderness (partly BLM) * Golden Trout Wilderness (mostly in Inyo NF) * Jennie Lakes Wilderness * Kiavah Wilderness (mostly BLM) * Monarch Wilderness (partly in Sierra NF) * South Sierra Wilderness (mostly in Inyo NF) Recreation The National Forest contains over of road and of trails, and hosts a number of camping and recreational facilities. The forest is adjacent to Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. History Sequoia National Forest was established on July 1, 1908 from a portion of Sierra Forest Reserve. On March 2, 1909 Theodore Roosevelt added land by Presidential Proclamation. On July 1, 1910 was removed from the forest to create the Kern National Forest. This land was returned to Sequoia National Forest on July 1, 1915. Giant sequoia groves The Sequoia National Forest has 34 giant sequoia groves. *The 14 groves in the Kings River watershed are in the northern section of Giant Sequoia National Monument (GSNM), or in the Sequoia National Forest (SeNF), in southernmost Fresno County and Tulare County: # Indian Basin Grove (GSNM) A mid-size grove, mostly logged. It can be accessed by paved roads. The grove contains many young sequoias approaching diameters of up to . 1800–2000 m. # Converse Basin Grove (GSNM). Once the second-largest grove, but much logged around 1890-1900; However, nearly 100 widely scattered old-growth Giant Sequoias remain (apparently bypassed by the loggers), also good regrowth of younger trees. Home of the Boole Tree, which the loggers spared as it was by far the largest tree in the grove and is now identified as the sixth-largest tree by volume. Also home of the Chicago Stump, which is the remnant of the General Noble Tree that was cut for the 1893 World Columbian Exposition; the General Noble Tree was the second largest tree in the grove (after the Boole Tree) and it was the largest tree ever cut down. Although not among the very largest Giant Sequoias, the General Noble Tree was perhaps among the top 30 largest Giant Sequoias before it was cut. 1800–2000 m. # Lockwood Grove (GSNM). 1700–1800 m. # Monarch Grove (GSNM). Immediately north of the Agnew Grove, near Monarch Wilderness boundary. On Forest Service GSNM map. # Evans Grove (GSNM). Partially logged, before 1920. 36°48'N 118°49'30\\"W 2050–2250 m. # Agnew & Deer Meadow Grove (GSNM). 1950–2000 m. # Cherry Gap Grove (GSNM). Logged. Located between Converse Basin Grove and General Grant Grove, near McGee Overlook (). 2070 m. Cherry Gap Grove is a small sequoia grove of about thirty-five acres in Sequoia national forest; it was logged of all of its old growth sequoias. # Abbott Creek Grove (GSNM). 1900 m. Listed by Rundel and Flint; very small (largely logged); too few trees to qualify as a grove according to Willard. # Kennedy Grove (GSNM). 2050–2250 m. Contains the 13th largest giant sequoia in the world, The Ishi Giant. # Little Boulder Creek Grove (GSNM). 2000 m. # Boulder Creek Grove (GSNM). 2050 m. # Landslide Grove (GSNM). 2050–2250 m. # Bearskin Grove (GSNM). 1850–1900 m. # Big Stump Grove (KCNP/GSNM). 1850 m. *One grove in the Kaweah River watershed: # Redwood Mountain Grove (KCNP/GSNM). The largest grove, 1240 ha (3100 acres), with 15,800 sequoias 30 cm (one foot) or more in diameter at the base. *The 19 groves in the Tule River and Kern River watersheds are mostly in Giant Sequoia National Monument (GSNM); all in southern Tulare County. #Upper Tule Grove (GSNM). Included on Forest Service GSNM map. #Maggie Mountain Grove (GSNM). #Silver Creek Grove (GSNM). #Mountain Home Grove (CSF / GSNM). Home of the 'Genesis' tree, seventh largest by volume, this grove also contains the smaller Middle Tule Grove #Burro Creek Grove (GSNM). #Wishon Grove (GSNM). South of Silver Creek Grove. Included on Forest Service GSNM map. #Alder Creek Grove (GSNM / private); also known as Hossack, Pixley, or Ross Creek Grove. Home of 'Alonzo Stagg', the fifth largest tree by volume. Also home to the Waterfall tree, which has the largest circumference and diameter at ground level of any sequoia. #McIntyre Grove (GSNM). #Carr Wilson Grove(GSNM); also known as Bear Creek Grove. #Freeman Creek Grove (GSNM). #Black Mountain Grove (GSNM / TIR / private). Heavily logged in 1984, though mature sequoias were not cut. #Red Hill Grove (GSNM / private). #Peyrone Grove (GSNM / TIR). #South Peyrone Grove (GSNM) New discovery by Willard in 1992. #Long Meadow Grove (GSNM), Site of the Trail of 100 Giants and one tree of great size. #Cunningham Grove (GSNM). #Starvation Creek Grove (GSNM). #Packsaddle Grove (GSNM). #Deer Creek Grove (GSNM). The southernmost grove. Giant Sequoia National Monument On April 15, 2000, President Bill Clinton proclaimed of the Sequoia National Forest as the Giant Sequoia National Monument by Presidential Proclamation 7295, published in the Federal Register, Tuesday, April 25, 2000, Vol. 65, No. 80. The monument is in two sections. The northern section surrounds General Grant Grove and other parts of Kings Canyon National Park and is administered by the Hume Lake Ranger District. The southern section is directly south of Sequoia National Park and is administered by the Western Divide Ranger District, surrounding the eastern half of the Tule River Indian Reservation. Cannabis Cultivation The forest has been the scene of extensive illegal marijuana cultivation, with recent involvement of Mexican drug cartels.

It is the first sequel to his best-selling novel The Blue Lagoon (1908), and continued with The Gates of Morning (1925). The Garden of God was adapted into the film Return to the Blue Lagoon. Plot summary The sequel picks up precisely where the first book left off, with Arthur Lestrange in the ship Raratonga discovering his son Dickyhttp://www.classicreader.com/book/565/ and niece Emmeline with their own child, lying in their fishing boat which has drifted out to sea. While the last line of The Blue Lagoon states that they are not dead but sleeping, the first line of the sequel is \\"No, they are dead\\", and the reader is told that they have stopped breathing. The child is drowsy but alive and is picked up by the sailors. Arthur is shaken, but at the same time relieved. He can see that Dicky and Emmeline were healthy and that they must have lived in peace. He feels it is better that they died while still in a savage state and did not have to return to civilization. He has a dream-vision of the pair; they ask him to come to Palm Tree, the island where they lived, and promise he will see them again. Their child becomes quite popular with the Raratongas crew. His favorite among the sailors is a rascally quasi-pirate called Jim Kearney. Because the child says \\"Dick\\" and \\"Em\\" while playing with the sailors, Kearney calls him Dick M. Captain Stanistreet has been concerned for Arthur's sanity since they found Dicky and Emmeline, but he appears calm when they get to Palm Tree, investigating the things the couple left behind. Only when he enters the house and finds the flower decorations and neatly arranged supplies—unmistakably the work of Emmeline—does he break down in tears. Arthur plans to stay on the island with Dick M and the captain of the Raratonga asks for volunteers from among his crew to stay also. Jim Kearney volunteers. The captain says they will return the following year, but the ship is promptly swallowed up in a storm out at sea. Arthur believes his dream-vision is partly fulfilled when he looks at Dick and notices characteristics of both Emmeline and Dicky in him. Kearney does most of the parenting for Dick. Years pass; Arthur dies quietly while walking in the forest and his body is never found. Kearney and Dick are left to their own devices until an intruder enters: a young woman named Katafa (her name means \\"Frigatebird\\"). She hails from the island of Karolin, forty miles away, which is populated by Kanaka natives. It is a huge, almost treeless coral atoll, with no water source other than rain. Dicky and Emmeline were aware of the Kanaka's existence, but never encountered them—for many reasons, they stay away from Palm Tree and believe it is haunted. Katafa is actually the daughter of a Spanish sea captain who was killed to prevent his taking water from their wells during a drought. Raised by priestess Le Juan, and psychologically conditioned as a taminan untouchable, she can talk and interact with Karolin natives, but cannot touch or be touched by them. She is on Palm Tree only because a storm blew her fishing boat off course. She makes friends with Dick and teaches him her language, naming him Taori, but Kearney is suspicious of her, particularly when he finds she evades touch. She is likewise antagonistic toward him for having tried to touch her. Her boat destroyed by a volley from a passing ship, she has to stay on Palm Tree until further notice. She lights a fire as a prayer to Nanawa, the ocean god, to return her to Karolin, but Kearney thinks she is trying to signal her people to attack the island. She gets back at Kearney by stealing his chewing gum, blunting his fish spears and sabotaging his fishing lines. He comes to believe she is out to kill him and is about to return the favor when, pursuing her into the lagoon, he is trapped and killed by a giant tentacled cephalopod. Left to themselves, Dick and Katafa live somewhat as Dicky and Emmeline had done; Dick taking Katafa for granted unless he wants help or an audience. Katafa still wants to go home; she creates an image of Nan, the gentler of Karolin's two gods, out of a coconut shell, and puts it up on the reef on a pole, as a signal should any Karolin fishermen come close to the island. The god belongs only to Karolin's people and will show either that someone from Karolin lives on Palm Tree, or that Nan has been \\"kidnapped\\". Sure enough, four Karolin fishermen arrive. Seeing their proprietary god on a reef with Dick (a foreigner) nearby, they attack him. He lashes out, killing one. Katafa is angry when she learns her people were that close, but she finds she cannot hate Dick; she's falling in love with him, to the point that she begins to desire to touch other living things. Dick wants to hug her, but she automatically evades him and hides in the forest, due to her psychological conditioning. The narrative focus shifts to Karolin. The three remaining fishermen return with their terrible news. The fisherman Dick killed was the grandson of the island's king, Uta Matu, and the fishermen assume that where they saw one 'foreigner', there must be dozens, maybe hundreds. Worst of all, Nan is there, seemingly stolen by the newcomers. Advised by Le Juan in one of her epileptic trances, the king declares war and all the men of Karolin assemble in their canoes, led by the king's son Laminai and his second son, Ma. In the middle of the night, Dick pursues Katafa through the forest once more, carrying a spear in case of trouble, when he runs straight into the warriors. He kills Ma with the spear and is about to be killed by Laminai, when Katafa leaps out of nowhere and attacks Laminai. The people have long believed Katafa to be dead, so the warriors flee, thinking she is a ghost. A sudden storm blows up, and in the darkness, noise and confusion the Kanaka kill each other. Now able to hold and touch one another, Dick and Katafa become lovers. They stay together on Palm Tree, but prepare to leave for Karolin. When a schooner of copra harvesters arrives, crewed by Melanesian slaves under the direction of two white men, Dick wants to speak to them, but is attacked. He kills the leader, and the Melanesians stage an uprising and take over the island. Dick and Katafa escape to Karolin. By chance, Dick has picked up a large, beautifully decorated club left by the warriors. Katafa tells Dick that it is the sacred war club, and can be carried only by men of the royal family, so he must be the new king of Karolin, and indeed, when they get there, Uta Matu has died. The people—women, very young men, and little children—have turned against old priestess Le Juan, who has terrorized them for so many years and whose advice had sent all the warriors to die on Palm Tree. She drops dead of a stroke when she sees Katafa, seemingly returned from the dead, and the people proclaim Dick their new king.

Its key signature consists of two sharps. Its relative minor is B minor and its parallel minor is D minor. The D major scale is: : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\time 7/4 d4 e fis g a b cis d cis b a g fis e d2 \\\\clef bass \\\\key d \\\\major } }  Characteristics  D major is well-suited to violin music because of the structure of the instrument, which is tuned G D A E. The open strings resonate sympathetically with the D string, producing a sound that is especially brilliant. This is also the case with all other orchestral strings. It is thus no coincidence that many classical composers throughout the centuries have chosen to write violin concertos in D major, including those by Mozart (No. 2, 1775, No. 4, 1775); Ludwig van Beethoven (1806); Paganini (No. 1, 1817); Brahms (1878); Tchaikovsky (1878); Prokofiev (No. 1, 1917); Stravinsky (1931); and Korngold (1945). The key is also appropriate for guitar music, with drop D tuning making two D's available as open strings. For some beginning wind instrument students, however, D major is not a very suitable key, since it transposes to E major on B wind instruments, and beginning methods generally tend to avoid keys with more than three sharps. Even so, the clarinet in B is still often used for music in D major, and it is perhaps the sharpest key that is practical for the instrument. There are composers however who, in writing a piece in D minor with B clarinets, will have them change to clarinets in A if the music switches to D major, two examples being Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in the fourth movement. The vast majority of tin whistles are in D, since they are often used in music with fiddles. It is a common key for Pub session playing.  History  In the Baroque period, D major was regarded as \\"the key of glory\\";Rita Steblin: A History of Key Characteristics in the Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries (Rochester, University of Rochester Press: 1996) p. 124 \\"The key of triumph, of Hallelujahs, of war-cries, of victory-rejoicing.\\" hence many trumpet concertos were in D major, such as those by Johann Friedrich Fasch, Gross, Molter (No. 2), Leopold Mozart, Telemann (No. 2), and Giuseppe Torelli. Many trumpet sonatas were in D major, too, such as those by Corelli, Petronio Franceschini, Purcell, and Torelli. \\"The Trumpet Shall Sound\\" and the \\"Hallelujah\\" chorus from Handel's Messiah, and his coronation anthem Zadok the Priest are in D major. 23 of Haydn's 104 symphonies are in D major, making it the most-often used main key of his symphonies. The vast majority of Mozart's unnumbered symphonies are in D major, namely K. 66c, 81/73, 97/73m, 95/73n, 120/111a and 161/163/141a. The symphony evolved from the overture, and \\"D major was by far the most common key for overtures in the second half of the eighteenth century.\\" This continued even into the Romantic Period, and was used for the \\"triumphant\\" final movements of several D minor symphonies, including Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Robert Schumann's Fourth Symphony, the only symphony by César Franck, Sergei Rachmaninoff's First Symphony, and Felix Mendelssohn's Fifth Symphony. Famous symphonies written in D major include Mozart's symphonies No. 31 (Paris) and No. 38 (Prague), Beethoven's No. 2 Op. 36, Brahms's No. 2 Op. 73, Sibelius's No. 2 Op. 43, Mahler's No. 9 (though it ends in the remote key of D-flat major) and Prokofiev's No. 1 (Classical) Op. 25.

It occurred at 17:10 on 26 November 1977 through the Hannington transmitter of the Independent Broadcasting Authority. Description On Saturday, 26 November 1977, Southern TV's Andrew Gardner was presenting the early-evening news. At 17:10 the TV picture wobbled slightly, followed by a deep buzz. The audio was replaced by a distorted voice delivering a message for almost six minutes. The hoaxer claimed to be Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command. Reports of the incident vary, some calling the speaker \\"Vrillon\\" or \\"Gillon\\", and others \\"Asteron\\". The interruption ceased shortly after the statement had been delivered, transmissions returning to normal shortly before the end of a Looney Tunes cartoon. Later in the evening, Southern Television apologised for what it described as \\"a breakthrough in sound\\" for some viewers. ITN also reported on the incident in its own late-evening Saturday bulletin. Transcript Speaking on British commercial radio on 6 December 1977, Sir John Whitmore also questioned newspaper reporting of the incident, referring to a recording of the complete broadcast which appeared to exist at the time. A complete transcript of the message reads:2012 A Family Brief: The Science is all in By Robert L. Horton > This is the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic > Command, speaking to you. For many years you have seen us as lights in the > skies.

The Winter 1977 issue of Fortean Times (issue #24) magazine featured a transcript of what they described as the 'short message' that was broadcast: > This is the voice of Asteron. I am an authorised representative of the > Intergalactic Mission, and I have a message for the planet Earth. We are > beginning to enter the period of Aquarius and there are many corrections > which have to be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be > destroyed.

Explanation At that time, the Hannington UHF television transmitter was unusual in being one of the few main transmitters which rebroadcast an off-air signal received from another transmitter (the Independent Broadcasting Authority's Rowridge transmitter on the Isle of Wight), rather than being fed directly by a landline. As a consequence it was open to this kind of signal intrusion, as even a relatively low-powered transmission very close to the rebroadcast receiver could overwhelm its reception of the intended signal, resulting in the unauthorised transmission being amplified and rebroadcast across a far wider area. The IBA stated to carry out a hoax would take \\"a considerable amount of technical know-how\\" and a spokesman for Southern Television confirmed \\"A hoaxer jammed our transmitter in the wilds of North Hampshire by taking another transmitter very close to it.\\" The hoaxer has not been identified. Public and media response The incident caused some local alarm and attracted publicity. In the next day's Sunday newspapers, the IBA announced the broadcast was a hoax. The IBA confirmed it was the first time such a hoax transmission had been made. Hundreds of worried viewers flooded Southern Television with calls on Saturday night after the voice interrupted the routine news programme for more than six minutes. Reports of the event carried worldwide with numerous American newspapers picking up the story from the UPI press agency. The broadcast became a footnote in ufology as some chose to accept the supposed \\"alien\\" broadcast at face value, questioning the explanation of a transmitter hijack. Within two days of the incident's report in The Times, a letter to the editor published on 30 November 1977 asked, \\"[How] can the IBA – or anyone else – be sure that the broadcast was a hoax?\\" The editorial board of one American regional newspaper—the Eugene Register- Guard—commented, \\"Nobody seemed to consider that 'Asteron' may have been for real.\\" By as late as 1985, the story had entered urban folklore, with suggestions there had never been any explanation of the broadcast. A 1999 episode of children's television series It's a Mystery featured the event, produced by one of Southern's successors, Meridian Television. The feature reenacted the incident with faux news reports and viewers watching the incident play out at home. Usage in popular culture Author Nelson Algren included a variation of the message in his book The Devil's Stocking (1983), a fictionalised account of the trial of Rubin Carter, a real-life prize-fighter who had been found guilty of double murder. In the book, as a period of unrest within the prison begins, the character 'Kenyatta' gives a speech closely mirroring the Fortean Times transcript of the Southern Television interruption: > \\"I am an authorized representative of the Intergalactic Mission,\\" Kenyatta > finally disclosed his credentials. \\"I have a message for the Planet Earth. > We are beginning to enter the period of Aquarius. Many corrections have to > be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be destroyed. You > have only a short time to learn to live together in peace.

The compound is used as a desiccant (to keep things dry by absorbing water from the air) and as a filter of fluoride, arsenic and selenium in drinking water. It is made of aluminium oxide (alumina; Al2O3). It has a very high surface-area-to-weight ratio, due to the many \\"tunnel like\\" pores that it has. Activated alumina in its phase composition can be represented only by metastable forms (gamma-Al2O3 etc.). Corundum (alpha-Al2O3), the only stable form of aluminum oxide, does not have such a chemically active surface and is not used as a sorbent. Uses =Catalyst applications= Activated alumina is used for a wide range of adsorbent and catalyst applications including the adsorption of catalysts in polyethylene production, in hydrogen peroxide production, as a selective adsorbent for many chemicals including arsenic, fluoride, in sulfur removal from fluid streams (Claus Catalyst process). =Desiccant= Used as a desiccant, it works by a process called adsorption. The water in the air actually sticks to the alumina itself in between the tiny passages as the air passes through them. The water molecules become trapped so that the air is dried out as it passes through the filter. This process is reversible. If the alumina desiccant is heated to ~200 °C, it will release the trapped water. This process is called regenerating the desiccant. =Fluoride adsorbent= Activated alumina is also widely used to remove fluoride from drinking water. In the US, there are widespread programs to fluoridate drinking water. However, in certain regions, such as the Rajasthan region of India, there is enough fluoride in the water to cause fluorosis. A study from the Harvard school of Public Health found exposure to fluoride as a child correlated with lower IQ. Activated alumina filters can easily reduce fluoride levels from 10 ppm to less than 1 ppm. The amount of fluoride leached from the water being filtered depends on how long the water is actually touching the alumina filter media. Basically, the more alumina in the filter, the less fluoride will be in the final, filtered water. Lower temperature water, and lower pH water (acidic water) are filtered more effectively too. Ideal pH for treatment is 5.5, which allows for up to a 95% removal rate. As per researches conducted by V.K.Chhabra, Chief Chemist (retd.) P.H.E.D. Rajasthan, activated alumina, when used as a fluoride filter, under field conditions can best be regenerated by a solution of lye (sodium hydroxide; NaOH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The fluoride uptake capacity (FUC) of activated alumina can be up to 5000 mg/kg. The FUC using V.K. Chhabra's method can be determined as follows: Fluoride solution: Dissolve 22.1 g anhydrous NaF in distilled water and dilute to 1,000 mL. 1 mL = 10 mg fluoride. 10 mL/L = 100 mg/L fluoride. Procedure: To one litre of simulated distilled water containing 100 mg/L of fluoride, agitate at 100 rpm using the jar test machine. Add 10 g of the AA under test. After one hour, switch off the machine and take out the solution. After 5 minutes, carefully decant the supernatant solution and determine the fluoride. Calculate the difference between the original and treated water fluoride concentration. Multiply the difference by 100 to give the fluoride uptake capacity of AA in mg/kg. =Vacuum systems= In high vacuum applications, activated alumina is used as a charge material in fore-line traps to prevent oil generated by rotary vane pumps from back streaming into the system. =Biomaterial= Its mechanical properties and non-reactivity in the biological environment allow it to be a suitable material used to cover surfaces in friction in body prostheses (e.g. hip or shoulder prostheses). Defluoridation Defluoridation is the downward adjustment of the level of fluoride in drinking water. Activated Alumina process is one of the widely used adsorption methods for the defluoridation of drinking water.

It was written between 1881 and 1883 and was revised in 1885. It is dedicated to Ludwig II of Bavaria. The premiere, given under Arthur Nikisch and the Gewandhaus Orchestra in the opera house at Leipzig on 30 December 1884,Sir Georg Solti and Chicago Symphony Orchestra - Bruckner: Symphony No. 7 - transcription from CD booklet (bar code 0-28941-76312-9), written by William Mann, London Records, 1988 brought Bruckner the greatest success he had known in his life. The symphony is sometimes referred to as the \\"Lyric\\", though the appellation is not the composer's own, and is seldom used. In the article \\"The 20 Greatest Symphonies of all time\\" from BBC Music Magazine, this symphony is placed at the 20th position. Bruckner also holds the 13th place with Symphony No. 8.

Near the end of the movement, there is a long pedal point on E, sustained by the double basses and timpani. = Second movement = This movement was composed between January and April 1883. Bruckner began writing it in anticipation of the death of Richard Wagner, who was in poor health. The movement features four Wagner tubas, which was their first appearance in a symphony: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative cis { \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Sehr feierlich und sehr langsam\\" 4 = 38 \\\\clef \\"treble\\" \\\\key cis \\\\minor \\\\stemUp \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"piano\\" \\\\time 4/4  % 1 cis4. \\\\p _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic {cresc. sempre} } ^( gis8 fisis8. bis16 cis8. dis16  % 2 gis,2. ) \\\\once \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f \\\\times 2/3 { gis8 ^( fis8 e8 }  % 3 cis'4 _\\\\markup{ \\\\italic {dim.} } e,8 cis'8 cis8 bis8 cis8 dis8  % 4 dis2 ) r2 } ew voice \\\\relative e' { \\\\clef \\"treble\\" \\\\key cis \\\\minor \\\\stemDown \\\\time 4/4  % 1 e2 _( fisis2  % 2 dis2 ) e2 _(  % 3 e2 a2  % 4 gis2 ) s2 } >> ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative e' { \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\key cis \\\\minor \\\\stemUp \\\\time 4/4 e1\\\\p ^( ^~  % 2 e2 d2 ) ^(  % 3 cis2 cis8 bis8 cis8 cis8  % 4 bis2 ) r2 } ew voice \\\\relative gis { \\\\clef \\"bass\\" \\\\key cis \\\\minor \\\\stemDown\\\\time 4/4 gis2 _( a2  % 2 gis2 ) b2 _(  % 3 a2 fis2  % 4 gis2 ) s2 } >> >> } A contrabass tuba is also present. The second part of the movement, beginning in F major, has a tune that Bruckner specialist Georg Tintner described as such: \\"If I could describe what makes Bruckner Bruckner to me, it is that tune.

It survives only in one autograph copy which includes later changes by Bruckner and others, so the exact contents of this version are lost and it is unpublished. = 1885 version =  Gutmann edition (published 1885)  Some changes were made after the 1884 premiere but before the first publication by Gutmann in 1885. It is widely accepted that Nikisch, Franz Schalk and Ferdinand Löwe had significant influence over this edition, but there is some debate over the extent to which these changes were authorized by Bruckner. These changes mostly affect tempo and orchestration.  Haas edition (published 1944)  Robert Haas attempted to remove the influence of Nikisch, Schalk and Löwe in order to retrieve Bruckner's original conception of the symphony. Haas used some material from the 1883 autograph but because this autograph also includes later changes much of his work was the product of conjecture. The most prominent feature of Haas's edition is the absence of cymbals, triangle and timpani in the slow movement: Haas asserted that Bruckner decided to omit the percussion, a claim scholar Benjamin Korstvedt deems \\"implausible\\".  Nowak edition (published 1954)  Leopold Nowak kept most of the changes in the 1885 Gutmann edition, including the percussion. He reprinted the tempo modifications from Gutmann but placed them in brackets. Some performances of this edition omit the cymbal crash at the climax of the slow movement, but it is included in the printed score. 1921 chamber arrangement An arrangement of this symphony for chamber ensemble (consisting of 2 violins, viola, cello, bass, clarinet, horn, piano 4-hands, and harmonium) was prepared in 1921 by students and associates of Arnold Schoenberg, for the Viennese \\"Society for Private Musical Performances\\": Hanns Eisler (1st and 3rd movements), Erwin Stein (2nd mvt.), and Karl Rankl (4th mvt.). The Society folded before the arrangement could be performed, and it was not premiered until more than 60 years later.  Instrumentation  The symphony requires the following orchestra: * woodwinds: 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons * brass: 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, 4 Wagner tubas (2 tenors in B, 2 basses in F)1, contrabass tuba * percussion2: timpani, cymbals, triangle * strings: violins 1, 2, violas, violoncellos, double basses 1Used in the 2nd and 4th movements only. 2Except for the third movement where the timpani figure prominently, use of percussion in the symphony is extremely limited. A timpani roll enters at the coda of the first movement. In some performance editions, the timpani re-enters along with cymbals and triangle together in the climax of the second movement (the only movement employing cymbals and triangle). Many conductors perform the second movement without percussion (as in the Haas edition), however; the decision is generally settled by the performers' preferences. In the last movement, the timpani rolls in brief climaxes before crescendoing with orchestral tutti in the final bars.  Discography  The first commercial recording was made by Oskar Fried with the Berlin State Opera Orchestra in 1924 for Polydor. Along with Symphony No. 4, the Seventh is the most popular Bruckner symphony both in the concert hall and on record. Herbert von Karajan's last recording with the Vienna Philharmonic, 23 April 1989, three months before his death, on the Deutsche Grammophon label, of the Haas edition of the 1885 score, has been singled out by Norman Lebrecht as #80 in his list of the 100 best recordings,Norman Lebrecht, \\"Masterpieces: 100 Milestones of the Recorded Century\\" The Life and Death of Classical Music. New York: Anchor Books (2007): 252 - 253 and described as \\"more human and vulnerable\\" than his earlier Berlin recording.Stephen Chakwin, \\"Anton Bruckner\\" in Classical Music: The Listener's Companion ed. Alexander J. Morin (San Francisco: Backbeat Books, 2002), p. 196 In reviewing the 1999 recording by Kurt Sanderling, the critic David Hurwitz listed as reference (benchmark) recordings of Bruckner's Seventh those by Eugen Jochum in 1976, Bernard Haitink in 1978, Karajan in 1989, and Günter Wand in 1999.David Hurwitz, ANTON BRUCKNER Symphony No. 7 ClassicsToday.com, posted March 4, 2001 Stephen Johnson prefers Karl Böhm's recording with the Vienna Philharmonic, saying that Böhm balances \\"clear-sighted formal understanding with a more fluid, supple approach to phrasing.\\"Stephen Johnson, Anton Bruckner Symphony no. 7 (1883), 1001 Classical Recordings You Must Hear Before You Die ed.

Its key signature has seven flats. The direct enharmonic equivalent of C-flat major is B major, a key signature with five sharps. The C-flat major scale is: C-flat major is the only major or minor key, other than theoretical keys, which has \\"flat\\" or \\"sharp\\" in its name, but whose tonic note is the enharmonic equivalent of a natural note (a white key on a keyboard instrument). Its relative minor is A-flat minor (or enharmonically G-sharp minor), and its parallel minor is C-flat minor, usually replaced by B minor, since C-flat minor's three double-flats make it generally impractical to use.  Use in harp music  C-flat major is the home key of the harp, with all its pedals in the top position, and it is considered the most resonant key for the instrument. Thus, in Richard Strauss's Ein Heldenleben, the first cue for the harps is written in C-flat major even though the rest of the orchestra, having previously played in E-flat major, retains a 3-flat key signature and is now playing in B major, marked with the necessary sharps and naturals as accidentals. This use of C-flat major in harp parts when the rest of the orchestra is playing in B major is not exceptional: it is standard practice in orchestral music written in B major for harp parts to be notated in C-flat major. In Arnold Bax's symphonic poem Tintagel, the key is B major and again the harp part is always notated in C-flat major; but in this case the harp's key signature contains only 6 flats, and the necessary Fs are notated with accidentals. In Claude Debussy's Sonata for Flute, Viola and Harp, the second movement has a middle section in B major, for which the harp part is notated in C-flat major with seven flats. In Reinhold Glière's Harp Concerto in E-flat major, the middle movement is a set of variations in C-flat major. Sometimes harp parts are also written in G-flat major when the rest of the orchestra is notated in F-sharp major. Harp parts can also be written in A-flat minor when the rest of the orchestra is notated in G-sharp minor.  Music in C-flat major  Although most composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent B major, since it only contains five sharps as opposed to C-flat major's seven flats, the middle section of Frédéric Chopin's Contredanse in G-flat major is written in C-flat major, as are the middle (Trio) sections of two of Ernesto Nazareth's Brazilian tangos for piano, \\"Chave de Ouro\\" and \\"Labirinto\\" (both with a home key of G-flat major), as well as the final half (last two themes) of William Bolcom's rag for piano, \\"Seabiscuits\\". There is a brief passage in the first movement, \\"Evocación\\", of Iberia by Isaac Albéniz which suggests the key of C-flat minor by adding the necessary three double-flats as accidentals. The surrounding passages are in C-flat major, with a 7-flat key signature. The movement is in sonata form, in the key of A-flat minor, so this places the second theme in the orthodox relative major key (and in the also-orthodox tonic major key of A-flat major when it reappears near the end of the piece). The slow movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 12 has a principal theme that modulates from A-flat minor to C-flat major, before moving to what would theoretically be C-flat minor, but is notated as B minor (every note in this passage requires an accidental, due to the key signature of seven flats). A few other works by Beethoven have significant passages in C-flat major, although they usually notate this with accidentals in some other key signature, because Beethoven found C-flat major's seven flats to be a difficult key; for example: * Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125 (Choral), mvmt. III: the section containing a prominent horn solo before the final return of a variant of the first theme, back in B-flat major * Piano Sonata No. 26 in E-flat major, Op. 81a (Les Adieux): several bars into the slow introduction to the first movement * Piano Sonata No. 31 in A-flat major, Op. 110, mvmt. III: the first appearance of the Arioso section is in A-flat minor (despite being notated with only 6, not 7, flats), and this includes a significant modulation to its relative major key of C-flat major * Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major, Op. 73 (Emperor): one of the transitional themes in the first movement's exposition section, between the first and second subjects. C-flat major is used for Benjamin Britten's Interlude in C-flat major for harp, several of Max Reger's Canons in All Major and Minor Keys (Book 1 Nos. 62 and 63, and Book 2 No. 48), and No. 29 from the Thirty Preludes in All Major and Minor Keys by Christian Heinrich Rinck. The first movement of Charles Koechlin's Partita for Chamber Orchestra, Op. 205, is in C-flat., Charles Koechlin's Partita for Chamber Orchestra, Op. 205 In some scores, the C-flat major key signature in the bass clef is written with the flat for the F on the second line from the top. This can be seen, for example, in the Albéniz example given above: Iberia, 1st movement: \\"Evocación\\", about two-thirds of which is in 7 flats, and every bass-clef staff of which shows this variant. This is also seen in the second movement of the Beautiful Danube waltz in the Boosey & Hawkes concert band edition.

It was founded in 1203–1204 by King John and (uniquely in Britain) populated by 30 monks sent from the abbey of Cîteaux in France, the mother house of the Cistercian order. The Medieval Latin name of the monastery was Bellus Locus Regis (\\"The beautiful place of the king\\"') or monasterium Belli loci Regis. Other spellings of the English name which occur historically are Bewley (16th century) and Beaulie (17th century). History =Foundation= The first Abbot of Beaulieu was Hugh, who stood high in the king's favour, often served in important diplomatic missions and was later to become Bishop of Carlisle. The king granted the new abbey a rich endowment, including numerous manors spread across southern England (particularly in Berkshire), land in the New Forest, corn, large amounts of money, building materials, 120 cows, 12 bulls, a golden chalice, and an annual tun of wine. John's son and successor, King Henry III was equally generous to Beaulieu, with the result that the abbey became very wealthy, though it was far from the richest English Cistercian house. Monks from Beaulieu founded four daughter houses, Netley Abbey (1239), Hailes Abbey (1246), Newenham Abbey (1247) and St Mary Graces Abbey (1350). =Buildings= The surviving wall and groundplan of the abbey church. The abbey's buildings were of a scale and magnificence reflecting its status as an important royal foundation. The church was a vast cruciform structure in early gothic style and heavily influenced by French churches of the order, especially those of Cîteaux, Bonport and Clairvaux. The church was long and had a semi-circular apse with 11 radiating chapels. The building took more than four decades to complete and was finally dedicated in 1246, in the presence of King Henry III and his queen, of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and of many prelates and nobles. South of the church stood a cloister, ranged around which were the chapter house, refectory, kitchens, storehouse and quarters for the monks, lay brothers and the abbot. A separate infirmary complex lay to the east of the main buildings, connected to them by a passage. The abbey was surrounded by workshops, farm buildings, guesthouses, a mill, and extensive gardens and fishponds. Strongly fortified gatehouses controlled entry to the monastic enclosure, which was defended by a wall. A water gate allowed access to ships in the river. =Exemption and sanctuary= Pope Innocent III constituted Beaulieu an \\"exempt abbey\\", meaning that the abbot had to answer to no local bishop but only to the Pope himself. Beaulieu was also invested by the same Pope with special privileges of sanctuary, much stronger than usual and covering not only the abbey itself but all the 23.5 hectare precinct around as included in the original grant made by King John. As Beaulieu was the only abbey in its region with such large and strongly enforced sanctuary rights, it soon became a refuge for fugitives, both ordinary criminals and debtors and also political enemies of the government. Among these latter were Anne Neville, wife of Warwick the Kingmaker, who sought sanctuary after the Battle of Barnet (1471). Twenty-six years later, Perkin Warbeck fled to Beaulieu from the pursuing armies of Henry VII. =Dissolution= The cloister at Beaulieu Abbey seen from the door to the church. On the left can be seen the refectory - now the Parish church of Beaulieu - on the right the west range, home of the abbey's lay brothers. In 1535 the abbey's income was assessed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's general survey of church finances prior to the plunder, at £428 gross, £326 net. According to the terms of the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, this meant that it escaped immediate confiscation, though the clouds were gathering. The last abbot of Beaulieu was Abbot Thomas Stevens, elected in 1536, who had formerly been abbot of the recently dissolved abbey of Netley, across Southampton Water. Though Beaulieu managed to survive until April 1538, at that point it was finally forced to surrender to the government. Many of the monks were granted pensions, the abbot receiving 100 marks per year. Abbot Thomas ended his days as treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral. He died in 1550. At the dissolution of the monastery in 1538, the Commissioners for the Dissolution reported to the government that thirty-two sanctuary-men, who were here for debt, felony, or murder, were living in houses in the monastic precincts with their wives and families. When the abbey was dissolved there was some debate about what to do with them, however, in the end it was decided, after pleading by the former abbot and certain government officials, to allow the debtors to live in their houses on the abbey grounds permanently. Pardons were given to some of the criminals too, including one Thomas Jeynes, a murderer. Country mansion The interior of the chapter house of Beaulieu Abbey. After Beaulieu fell there was much competition amongst courtiers to gain ownership of the abbey and its valuable estates, but eventually Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, won the struggle and King Henry granted him the abbey itself and 3,441 hectares of the Beaulieu lands. As soon as he took over, Wriothesley set about building himself a house on the site. He demolished the church, as was common practice but, unusually, instead of converting the buildings around the cloister into a home he chose the great gatehouse as the core of his mansion (compare Wriothesley's other converted monastery at Titchfield Abbey or the conversion of neighbouring Netley Abbey). This survives – much extended – as the modern country house at Beaulieu known as Palace House. Lord Southampton preserved the monks' refectory, which he gave to the people of Beaulieu village to be their parish church, a function it still serves today. The west range of the abbey, known as the Domus, was also saved. The rest of the abbey was allowed to fall into ruin. Today The Domus, or lay-brothers' living quarters, now a museum Although a great deal was destroyed at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, there is still much to see. The groundplan of the 102-metre- long church can be seen on the lawns. The position of the altar is marked by a cross and flanking trees. The Domus, once the lay brothers' refectory and lodgings and, later, chambers for important guests once the lay brothers had vanished, now houses an exhibition of monastic life prior to Thomas Wriothesley's takeover. Visitors can view a series of modern embroidered wall hangings made by Belinda, Lady Montagu, depicting scenes from medieval monastic life and the history of the abbey since 1204. The abbey refectory survives as the parish church and there are substantial ruins of the other buildings round the cloister. The abbey cloister is a place of tranquillity, planted with fragrant herbs. Beaulieu remains in the hands of the descendants of Wriothesley, who still live there. The Abbey is open to the public as part of the visitor attraction known as \\"Beaulieu\\", which includes: *Beaulieu Abbey *National Motor Museum *Beaulieu Palace House *World of Top Gear *Secret Army Exhibition – an exhibit about the Special Operations Executive training at Beaulieu during World War II *Gardens *A monorail *Rides The Domus is regularly used for events, dining and corporate hospitality. Folklore The cloister and the refectory =Foundation legend= Beaulieu Abbey was the sole religious foundation of King John. The legend of this event, first told in a Kirkstall chartulary, is related by the antiquarian William Dugdale, who incorrectly suggested that \\"King John being offended with the Cistercian order in England, and the Abbots of that Order coming to him to reconcile themselves, he caused them to be trod under his Horses Feet, for which Action being terrified in a Dream, he built and bestowed the Abby of Beau-lieu in Newforest for 30 monks of that order.\\" The legend was repeated in a later work by the topographer Thomas Cox. Modern re-tellings of the king's \\"babbling dream\\" state that he dreamed of being scourged with rods and thongs by the abbots he had commanded be trampled and he awoke to find his body still ached from the blows in his dream. The king is said to have taken great interest in the construction of the abbey and even to have expressed a desire to be entombed beneath the high altar. =Reported hauntings= Beaulieu, according to the official website, is one of the most haunted places in Britain, with reported sightings going back over a hundred years. The sound of Gregorian chant, considered an omen by local tradition, have been reported by Mrs Elizabeth Varley, daughter of John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, and Michael C. Sedgwick, former curator of the National Motor Museum, amongst others. Among the many reported sightings of monks (allegedly white and brown clad) in the abbey ruins and in the parish church, including one by the actress Margaret Rutherford, is an often repeated tale involving a group of local boys sheltering from a storm in a disused boathouse who see a rowing boat making for the shore. The eccentric Reverend Robert Frazer Powles, Vicar of Beaulieu (1886–1939), claimed to have gone so far as to converse with ghostly monks whom he knew by name, and even to have celebrated candlelit midnight mass every Christmas Eve for them. In culture The post- Dissolution mansion at Beaulieu, known as Palace House, was built around the mediaeval gatehouse of the abbey (the double gabled building in the centre- right of the picture). =Literature= Beaulieu Abbey is the setting of the opening chapters in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel The White Company. F. T. Prince's poem \\"At Beaulieu\\"', from his 1963 collection, The Doors of Stone, describes the double heart-coffin on display in the Abbey. Prince, who was Professor of English at the University of Southampton from 1957 to 1974, probably visited the site sometime in the late 1950s/early 1960s. Sir John Betjeman's poem \\"Youth and Age on Beaulieu River\\"\\"Youth and Age on Beaulieu River\\" is based on a visit he made to the New Forest. Furthermore, Beaulieu Abbey plays a prominent role in Edward Rutherfurd's epic novel The Forest through hundreds of years. =Media appearances= The abbey's status as \\"one of the most haunted places in Britain\\" has drawn a number TV productions there. *NBC documentary The Stately Ghosts of England, based on the book by Diana Norman, featuring Margaret Rutherford and Stringer Davis broadcast on 25 January 1965. *BBC Worldwide special Ghostwatch Live broadcast on 26 October 2001. *Antix Productions Most Haunted Live!

It lies 28,5 kilometers from Skellefteå City. This is where Boliden AB was founded in early 20th century after the findings in the mine that was called the Boliden mine.

Following a series of acquisitions during the 1980s and 1990s the company acquired mining and smelting assets of the Finnish mining and smelting company Outokumpu in 2003. Outokumpu acquired the subsidiary Boliden Contech and Boliden's copper and zinc divisions. As a consequence of the deal, Outokumpu ended up controlling 49 percent of the Boliden shares. The company has approximately 4,500 employees. The name comes from the Boliden mine, some 30 km northwest of the Swedish town of Skellefteå, where gold was found in 1924. It was once Europe's largest and richest gold mine, but since 1967 the mine has been defunct. Mines Business Area Mines conducts exploration, mining and milling operations in Sweden and Ireland. Its main products are zinc and copper concentrate, with some lead, gold and silver content. The goods produced are sold both to the Group's own smelters and to external customers. Boliden owns and operates Europe's biggest zinc mine at Tara in Ireland. Tara became part of Boliden in early 2004, but production began there in 1977, since when over 60 million tonnes of ore have been mined. Boliden also owns Garpenberg, which is Sweden's oldest mine still in operation. Mining at Garpenberg began back in the 13th century. The mineral- rich Skellefte field lies within the Boliden Area, where almost 30 mines have been opened since production began in the 1920s and where Boliden currently operates the Renström and Kristineberg underground mines and the Maurliden open pit mine. Boliden also owns and operates the Aitik open pit mine, which is one of Europe's biggest copper mines. Metal grades at Aitik are low, but this is compensated for by high productivity levels and efficient milling processes that also exploit the ore's gold and silver content. An expansion project that will double Aitik's ore production to 36 million tonnes per annum by 2014 began in 2007 and will be completed in 2010. Smelters Business Area Smelters refines both metal concentrate and secondary materials to produce base and precious metals at smelters in Sweden, Finland and Norway. The main metals are zinc and copper but the production of lead, gold and silver also makes a substantial contribution to the Business Area's revenues. Other products include sulphuric acid and aluminium fluoride. Boliden owns and operates two zinc and two copper smelters and one lead smelter. The Kokkola zinc smelter in Finland is the second largest in Europe and the fifth largest in the world, and mainly produces an alloy used in the galvanising of thin sheet metal. The Odda zinc smelter, which produces zinc for the steel industry and aluminium fluoride for Norway's aluminium industry, is located on the west coast of Norway. The Rönnskär copper smelter is located in the Swedish town of Skelleftehamn and its main products are copper, zinc clinker, lead and precious metals. The smelter, which produces sulphuric acid as a by-product of its operations, also produces metals from electronic scrap and other secondary materials. The Harjavalta copper smelter, located on the west coast of Finland, produces copper cathodes that are mainly sold to manufacturers of semi-finished goods. Other important products include gold, silver and sulphuric acid. The Bergsöe lead smelter outside Landskrona in southern Sweden extracts lead from scrap car batteries. Bergsöe is one of Europe's four biggest players in the lead recycling industry. Approximately 60 per cent of the plant's lead production is sold to the European battery industry, with the remainder used in the manufacture of roofing sheet. History On 10 December 1924, a sensational ore deposit was discovered at Fågelmyran, just over 30 km northwest of Skellefteå. Test drilling revealed what was then Europe's richest ore. The first Boliden ore was extracted in the spring of 1926 at what would become the Boliden mine – a mine that would prove, over the course of several decades, to be Europe's biggest and richest gold mine. The deposit also included copper and large amounts of silver. The town of Boliden quickly grew up around the mine. The leading light in the development of the Boliden company was Oscar Falkman (1877–1961), who was the driving force behind the exploration work that began in the second decade of the 20th century, and which was accelerated due to the metal shortage that arose in the wake of World War I. Falkman continued in the role of Boliden's President until 1941. Boliden AB was also part of the financier Ivar Kreuger's business empire until 1932. The Rönnskär smelter was built to process the Boliden ore, and commenced smelting operations in 1930. The world's longest ore tramway, between Boliden's mine in Kristineberg and Boliden became operational in 1943. The ore tramway was 96 km long and by the time it was shut down, 44 years later, it had transported 12 million tonnes of concentrate. Operations started at the Aitik mine, outside Gällivare, in 1968. This open pit mine would develop, over the years, into one of Europe's biggest copper mines. During its first year of operations, it produced approximately 9,000 tonnes of copper, 160 kg of gold and 7 tonnes of silver. The company grew during the first few years of the 1970s thanks to a joint venture with the German company, Preussag. This led to the expansion of Boliden's lead smelting and refining capacity, and in 1976, Boliden launched a Kaldo type furnace, for processing metals. 1976 also saw Boliden launch the first flash smelting furnace for lead, applying Kaldo technology, at Rönnskär. In the mid-1980s, Boliden exported a total of 20,000 tonnes of metallic residues from the Rönnskär smelter to a Chilean company, Promel, for processing. Boliden paid Promel for processing work that was never carried out and the residues were, instead, stored on the outskirts of the town of Arica at a site which was converted to a low-cost residential area in the 1990s on the instructions of the social services. The residents were unaware of the waste's presence and as a result, many people came to harm. In the autumn of 2009, the Chilean government announced that the 7,000 or so residents of the area would be evacuated. The waste was exported before the Basel Convention prohibiting the export of environmentally hazardous waste came into force. At the end of 1986, the Trelleborg industrial conglomerate acquired a controlling interest in Boliden. The same year also saw Boliden acquire the Spanish company, Apirsa S.L., which extracted zinc from the Aznalcóllar open pit mine, 45 km west of Seville. Trelleborg launched a major restructuring of the Boliden Group in 1996, and the new company, Boliden Limited, was formed in Toronto. Two years later, Boliden Ltd. bought the Canadian company Westmin. On 25 April 1998, the tailings dam at Apirsa's Los Frailes mine burst and 4.5 million cubic metres of tailings sand drained out into the nearby Guadiamar river, near Doñana National Park, causing the worst environmental accident in Spain so far. Extensive investigations revealed defects in both the dam's original construction and in subsequent construction projects. The company reacted quickly to the situation and immediately began a comprehensive programme of reclamation work. In 2006, Boliden lost the demand against the companies that built the dam Aznalcóllar. The Spanish Supreme Court also confirmed that Boliden should pay 43,7 million euros to the Spanish government. The recovery costs of Aznalcóllar are estimated to be 240 million euro; Boliden has not assumed any part of these costs. In 1999, Boliden implemented a restructuring programme at Group level and the Boliden share was listed on the Stockholm stock exchange. In 2001, Boliden's head office was relocated back to Sweden. In late 2003, Boliden bought smelters and a mine from the Finnish steel group, Outokumpu, and as a result, the Kokkola and Harjavalta/Pori smelters in Finland and the Odda smelter in Norway became part of Boliden. The purchase also included the Tara zinc mine in Ireland. History in brief 2006 Decision to invest in an expansion of the Aitik mine. Agreement with OM Group Inc (OMG) regarding the refining of nickel concentrate at Harjavalta. Successful exploration resulted in increases to Garpenberg's ore reserves. A new lead section was also opened at Bergsöe. 2005 Kvarnberget is the name given to a new mineralisation discovered in Garpenberg. Decision to invest in expansion of the Harjavalta smelter. Feasibility study of possible expansion of the Aitik mine. Boliden sells its shares in Breakwater Resources and Lundin Mining. First edition of Boliden's in-house magazine, \\"Boliden Magazine\\", published. 2004 New Boliden is created through the structural transaction with Outokumpu. Work begins on creating Boliden's new strategic platform – the New Boliden Way (NBW). The Odda zinc smelter is modernised. 2003 Boliden acquires Outokumpu's mining and smelting operations and sells its Fabrication and Technology Sales operations to Outokumpu. 2001 A fourth expansion takes place at Kokkola, increasing capacity to 260,000 tonnes per year, making it one of the world's biggest zinc smelters. 2000 Harjavalta's nickel operations are sold. Maurliden, the 28th mine in the Boliden Area, opens. The new Rönnskär complex is inaugurated. 1998 The Spanish Los Frailes mine closes as a result of the tailings dam failure, causing extensive damage in the environment, near Doñana National Park. The Rönnskär +200 expansion – an investment of SEK 1.9 billion – is approved. The direct leaching method is implemented at Kokkola. 1997 Boliden establishes its head office in Toronto. The share is listed on the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges. 1995 Harjavalta is expanded, increasing copper production by 60 per cent and nickel production by 200 per cent. 1993 The “copper shuttle” train begins transporting copper cathodes from Skelleftehamn to Elektrokoppar in Helsingborg. 1990 The concentrator at Boliden is expanded and modernised. The Outokumpu Group is incorporated, and the zinc smelter becomes known as Outokumpu Zinc Oy and the copper and nickel smelters as Outokumpu Harjavalta Metals Oy. 1988 The Spanish mining company, Apirsa SL, becomes a subsidiary of Boliden. 1987 The Swedish industrial conglomerate, Trelleborg AB, takes a controlling interest in Boliden. 1979 Boliden buys Paul Bergsöe & Son. 1977 Production starts at the Irish zinc mine, Tara. 1970 Production of aluminium fluoride begins at Odda.

Controversy In the mid-1980s, Boliden was involved in a dumping controversy in Chile. According to Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, \\"Boliden shipped approximately 20,000 tonnes of smelter sludge to the Polygono area in Arica between 1984 and 1985. The waste derived from Boliden’s Rönnskär arsenic plant in Sweden and was sold to a Chilean company, Promel, for processing. However, the waste was reportedly left unprocessed and unprotected at the site until 1998. Starting in 1989, housing developments were built nearby, but Chilean authorities concluded in 2009 that the area should be evacuated as it remained contaminated.\\" The Boliden controversy in Chile stirred debate in the Swedish news in 2013, after 700 Chilean victims suffering from arsenic poisoning filed a lawsuit against Boliden. See also the Doñana disaster, caused by negligence on the part of Boliden-Apirsa. In 2016, Boliden was ranked as being among the 13th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights in the Arctic. In media and popular culture  The Aitik copper mine (a major mine within the company) was featured on a 2007 episode of the Discovery Channel series \\"Really Big Things\\". Released in 2014, Swedish director Roy Andersson's film A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence includes a controversial scene which, according to the director, refers to Boliden's involvement in dumping dangerous toxins in the Chilean city Arica in the 1980s. In a review of the film, film critic Jessica Kiang describes the scene: \\"And in probably the most unsettling and memorable scene, which plays out like a live action Monty Python animation, colonial-era British soldiers pack a huge brass drum outfitted with trumpet horns of varying sizes with chained black slaves. The door is closed, and a fire is lit beneath the drum, which begins to revolve slowly (it is emblazoned with the name of Swedish mining giant Boliden) and to emit a kind of music. All this, it is revealed, is being enacted for the entertainment of a group of elderly rich, champagne-sipping white people in evening wear.\\" The smelting victims in Arica is also the topic of Toxic Playground, a Swedish documentary by William Johansson and Lars Edman released in 2009.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Progressive Conservative from 1936 until the time of his death. He was born in Kaleida, Manitoba and served as reeve of the Rural Municipality of Pembina from 1935 to 1936. A farmer and auctioneer in private life, Morrison was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1936 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal-Progressive Frank W. McIntosh by 351 votes in the constituency of Manitou. He was returned by acclamation in the 1941 election, after the Progressive Conservatives joined the Liberal-Progressives and other parties in a coalition government. Morrison was again returned by acclamation in the 1945 election, albeit under unusual circumstances: his CCF opponent narrowly missed the deadline to declare his candidacy, and was unable to participate in the vote. Morrison left the governing coalition in the late 1940s, after Liberal-Progressive Douglas Campbell was chosen as Premier of Manitoba. In the 1949 provincial election, he ran as an anti-coalition Progressive Conservative and defeated a pro-coalition Progressive Conservative by over 1,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives left the coalition government in 1950, and Morrison rejoined the party caucus. He was easily re- elected over a Liberal-Progressive opponent in the 1953 election. Morrison died in Morden in 1957, one year before the Progressive Conservatives won a minority government under Dufferin Roblin's leadership. His widow, Carolyne Morrison, served as a Progressive Conservative MLA from 1960 to 1969.

A dewan was the head of a state institution of the same name (see Divan). Diwans belonged to the elite families in the history of Mughal and post-Mughal India and held high posts within the government. Etymology The word is Persian in origin and was loaned into Arabic. The original meaning was \\"bundle (of written sheets)\\", hence \\"book\\", especially \\"book of accounts,\\" and hence \\"office of accounts,\\" \\"custom house,\\" \\"council chamber\\". The meaning of the word, divan \\"long, cushioned seat\\" is due to such seats having been found along the walls in Middle Eastern council chambers. It is a common surname among Sikhs in Punjab. http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=divan Council The word first appears under the Caliphate of Omar I (A.D. 634–644). As the Caliphate state became more complicated, the term was extended over all the government bureaus. The divan of the Sublime Porte was the council or Cabinet of the state. In the Ottoman Empire, it consisted of the usually (except in the Sultan's presence) presiding Grand Vizier and other viziers, and occasionally the Janissary Ağa. In 19th-century Romania, the Ad hoc Divan was a body which played a role in the country's development towards independence from Ottoman rule. In Javanese and related languages, the cognate \\"dewan\\" is the standard word for council, as in the Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat or (Indonesia's Council of People's Representatives) and Dewan Negara (Senate of Malaysia). Indian subcontinent =Mughal Empire= During the effective rule of Mughal India, the Dewan served as the chief revenue officer of a province. Later, when most vassal states gained various degrees of self-determination, the finance — and/or chief minister and leader of many princely states (especially Muslim, but also many Hindu, including Baroda, Hyderabad, Mysore, Kochi, Travancore — referred to as Dalawa until 1811) became known as a dewan. Exceptionally, a ruler was himself titled Dewan or a loftier variation, notably: * in Beri- Bundelkhand * in Dhurwai * in Jaso (Jassu) and in Bandhora (which was split from the former c. 1750) * in Khilchipur until 1873, then Rai Bahadur * in Junagadh, where Shah Nawaz Bhutto was the prime minister of the former princley state. * Diwan Sahib or Diwan Bahadur in Garrauli State =Maratha period= As a title used in various Early Modern Indian states, Diwan denoted the highest officials in the court after the king; the suffix -ji is added as a mark of respect in India.https://luthar.com/2014/05/06/the-meaning-of-the- term-ji-in-the-indian-culture-by-dr-harsh-k-luthar/ In the major Maratha states of Baroda (ruled by the Gaekwad), Gwalior (ruled by Scindias or Shinde), Indore (ruled by Holkar), and Nagpur (ruled by Bhonsle, but not from the Chhatrapati Shivaji family), the highest officer after the king was called the Diwan. One of the examples – Shrimant Diwan/Rao Bahadur Atmaram Kulkarni, was the Diwan (Prime Minister) of Maratha Jamkhandi State. In the 19th century, the British Parliament established in British India a supreme court for revenue matters (non-criminal matters) named the \\"Sudder Dewanny Adawlut\\", which applied Hindu law.Campbell, Lawrence Dundas (ed), Asiatic Annual Register for 1802, or A View of the History of Hindustan and of the Politics, Commerce and Literature of Asia, London, J. Debrett, 1803, footnote pp.97-100, Miscellaneous Tracts Definition per James Mill (1826): \\"Dewan, Duan: place of assembly. Native minister of the revenue department; and chief justice, in civil causes, within his jurisdiction; receiver-general of a province. The term is also used, to designate the principal revenue servant under a European collector, and even of a Zemindar.

Diwan also became a surname of high- caste Hindus or Sikhs in the Punjab region. =Chhattisgarhi Rajput- Brahmins= There is also a community with the surname Diwan found in Chhattisgarh, near the Bilaspur and Janjgir-Champa regions. This is a Brahmin- Rajput community descendant from Deo Brahmin-Rajputs who migrated from Purvanchal in Uttar Pradesh. The males in this community take the title Dhar (eg. Mohan Dhar Diwan, a high-ranked member of Vishwa Hindu Parishad). They had a fight with the royal family of Ratanpur, defeated the king, and started ruling the Ratanpur estate. =Diwani in British India= After the Battle of Buxar, when Bengal was annexed by the East India Company in 1764, the Mughal Emperor granted the Company the Diwani (the right to collect revenue) in Bengal and Bihar in 1765. \\"Chapter 5: Early Modern India II: Company Raj\\", \\"Chapter 3: The East India Company Raj, 1772-1850,\\" \\"Chapter 7: Company Raj and Indian Society 1757 to 1857, Reinvention and Reform of Tradition.\\" The term Diwani thus referred to British (fiscal) suzerainty over parts of India during the early British Raj. =Diwani in French India= In French India, one of its constituent colonies, Yanaon, had Zamindar and Diwan. They were active in its local and municipal administration during French rule. The Zamindar of Yanam was given a 4-gun salute by French counterparts. * Zamindar — Manion Canacaya * Diwan — Bouloussou Soubramaniam Sastroulou * Sovereignty — French Colonial Empire =Nepal= The document dated Bikram Samvat 1833 Bhadra Vadi 3 Roj 6 (i.e. Friday 2 August 1776), shows that Vamsharaj Pande and Swaroop Singh Karki had carried the title of Dewan (equivalent to Prime Minister) of the Kingdom of Nepal.

Midtown was formed in November 1998 by three Rutgers University students, but soon became a quartet. The group released three full-length studio albums and three extended plays before disbanding in 2005. In early 2014, Midtown reunited to play three shows, the first as a secret show at The Knitting Factory in Brooklyn, and the two remaining at the Skate And Surf Festival. History Midtown was formed in 1998 by Rutgers University students Gabe Saporta (vocals/bass), Rob Hitt (drums), Tyler Rann (guitar/vocals). The group added Heath Saraceno on guitar/vocals, and used its roots in the New Jersey punk scene to develop a sound that combined elements of pop punk and punk rock. Midtown began recording shortly after its formation. The band's first EP, The Sacrifice of Life, was released by Pinball Records in 1999, followed by a debut album, Save the World, Lose the Girl, released in early 2000 by the American independent record label Drive-Thru Records. The band was then upstreamed to major label MCA Records for its following album, Living Well Is the Best Revenge (2002). Midtown's next album, Forget What You Know (2004), was produced while the band was not under contract with a record label and was later picked up by Columbia Records. This was the band's final studio album; they disbanded shortly after its release, in 2005. Former frontman Gabe Saporta then became the lead singer of the now- defunct alternative dance/synthpop band Cobra Starship, which disbanded in November 2015. Former guitarist Heath Saraceno joined the band Senses Fail in 2005 but decided to leave them in 2009 to pursue personal endeavors. Tyler Rann went on to sing for Band of Thieves with some friends but eventually left the music business and now works in the fashion/clothing industry. =Brief reunion= On February 17, 2014, Saporta announced that Midtown has reunited and performed at the Skate and Surf Festival.

Outside of Iceland, they are known among music collectors for their rare releases on Parlophone, sung in English and recorded in London for export. The most famous of these is the 1966 EP Umbarumbamba, regarded as one of the rarest released records in the world and known to fetch prices into the thousands of dollars when a copy surfaces. Their style can be described as garage rock, fuzz rock, and freakbeat, with noticeable influences from both The Who and The Beatles. History Formed in Keflavik in 1963 under the name Hljómar (literally \\"Chords\\"), they soon became popular in Iceland at a time when local rock music was a rarity. By the mid-1960s they were recording in London on Parlophone Records for the international market, including the legendary EP Umbarumbamba, now a valuable collector's item. This record was recorded as a tie-in with a movie starring the band also entitled Umbarumbamba, but the film was not a success.Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond, 1964-1969. Liner notes, p.85. Rhino Records: 2001. From these sessions also came the singles \\"Once\\" and \\"If You Knew\\". The band even attempted a single entitled \\"Stay\\" in the United States on Columbia Records, which was produced by John Simon, known for his work with The Band and Big Brother and the Holding Company's album Cheap Thrills with Janis Joplin. In 1969 a number of Thor's Hammer members went on to form the prog-flavored band Trúbrot, which recorded four albums until itself splitting in 1973. Continual interest in the band among collectors of 1960s rock music lead to the 2001 Ace Records compilation album From Keflavik With Love, which collects all of the band's English-language output, including the tracks from Umbarumbamba, \\"Once\\", \\"If You Knew\\", and \\"Stay\\", as well as a number of their Icelandic tracks.

Structure The levator palpebrae superioris originates from inferior surface of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone, just above the optic foramen. It broadens and decreases in thickness (becomes thinner) and becomes the levator aponeurosis. This portion inserts on the skin of the upper eyelid, as well as the superior tarsal plate. It is a skeletal muscle. The superior tarsal muscle, a smooth muscle, is attached to the levator palpebrae superioris, and inserts on the superior tarsal plate as well. = Blood supply = The levator palebrae superioris receives its blood supply from branches of the ophthalmic artery, specifically, muscular branches and the supraorbital artery. Blood is drained into the superior ophthalmic vein. =Nerve supply= The levator palpebrae superioris receives motor innervation from the superior division of the oculomotor nerve. The smooth muscle that originates from its undersurface, called the superior tarsal muscle is innervated by postganglionic sympathetic axons from the superior cervical ganglion. Function The levator palpebrae superioris elevates the upper eyelid. Clinical significance Damage to this muscle or its innervation can cause ptosis, which is drooping of the eyelid. Lesions in CN III can cause ptosis, because without stimulation from the oculomotor nerve the levator palpebrae cannot oppose the force of gravity, and the eyelid droops. Ptosis can also result from damage to the adjoining superior tarsal muscle or its sympathetic innervation. Such damage to the sympathetic supply occurs in Horner's syndrome and presents as a partial ptosis. It is important to distinguish between these two very different causes of ptosis. This can usually be done clinically without issue, as each type of ptosis is accompanied by other distinct clinical findings. The ptosis seen in paralysis of the levator palpebrae superioris is usually more pronounced than that seen due to paralysis of the superior tarsal muscle.

Some individuals show greater asymmetry than others. As a form of biological asymmetry, fluctuating asymmetry (FA), along with anti-symmetry and direction asymmetry, refers to small, random deviations away from perfect bilateral symmetry. This deviation from perfection is thought to reflect the genetic and environmental pressures experienced throughout development, with greater pressures resulting in higher levels of asymmetry. Examples of FA in the human body include unequal sizes (asymmetry) of bilateral features in the face and body, such as left and right eyes, ears, wrists, breasts, testicles, and thighs. Research has exposed multiple factors that are associated with FA. As measuring FA can indicate developmental stability, it can also suggest the genetic fitness of an individual. This can further have an effect on mate attraction and sexual selection, as less asymmetry reflects greater developmental stability and subsequent fitness. Human physical health is also associated with FA. For example, young men with greater FA report more medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA. Multiple other factors can be linked to FA, such as intelligence and personality traits.  Measurement  Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) can be measured by the equation: Mean FA = mean absolute value of left sides - mean absolute value of right sides. The closer the mean value is to zero, the lower the levels of FA, indicating more symmetrical features. By taking many measurements of multiple traits per individual, this increases the accuracy in determining that individual's developmental stability. However, these traits must be chosen carefully, as different traits are affected by different selection pressures. This equation can further be used to study the distribution of asymmetries at population levels, to distinguish between traits that show FA, directional asymmetry, and anti-symmetry. The distribution of FA around a mean point of zero suggests that FA is not an adaptive trait, where symmetry is ideal. Directional asymmetry of traits can be distinguished by showing significantly biased measurements towards traits being larger on either the left or right sides, for example, human testicles (where the right is more commonly larger), or handedness (85% are right handed, 15% are left handed). Anti-symmetry can be distinguished by the bimodal distributions, due to some adaptive functions.  Causes  Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often considered to be the product of developmental stress and instability, caused by both genetic and environmental stressors. The notion that FA is a result of genetic and environmental factors is supported by Waddington's notion of canalisation, which implies that FA is a measure of the genome's ability to successfully buffer development to achieve a normal phenotype under imperfect environmental conditions. Various factors causing developmental instability and FA include infections, mutations, and toxins. = Genetic factors = Research on twins suggests that there are genetic influences on FA, and increased levels of mutations and perturbations is also linked to greater asymmetry. FA may also result from a lack of genetic immunity to diseases, as those with higher FA show less effective immune responses. This is further supported by evidence showing an association between FA and the number of respiratory infections experienced by an individual, such that those with higher levels of FA experience more infections. Increased prevalence of parasites and diseases in an organism is also seen more in individuals with greater levels of FA. However, the research in this field is predominantly correlational, so caution must be taken when inferring causation. For example, rather than a lack of immunity causing FA, FA may weaken the immune responses of an organism, or there may be another factor involved. There is some speculation that inbreeding contributes towards FA. One study on ants demonstrated that, although inbred individuals show more asymmetry in observed bilateral traits, the differences were not significant. Furthermore, ant colonies created by an inbreeding queen do not show significantly higher FA than those produced by a non-inbreeding queen. = Environmental factors = Multiple sources provide information on environmental factors that are correlated with FA. A meta-analysis of related studies suggests that FA is an appropriate marker of environmental stress during development. Some evidence suggests that poverty and lack of food during development may contribute to greater levels of FA. Infectious diseases can also lead to FA, as studies have repeatedly shown that those with higher FA report more infections. Alternatively, this association between levels of FA and infections may be due to a lack of immunity to diseases, as mentioned earlier (see 'Genetic factors'). Fluctuating asymmetry in human males is also seen to positively correlate with levels of oxidative stress. This process occurs when an organism creates excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to ROS-neutralising antioxidants. Oxidative stress may mediate the association seen between high FA and infection amounts during development. Toxins and poisons are considered to increase FA. Pregnancy sickness is argued to be an adaptation for avoiding toxins during foetal development. Research has reported that when a mother has no sickness or a sickness that extends beyond week 12 of gestation, the offspring shows higher FA (as demonstrated by measuring thigh circumferences). This suggests that when a mother fails to expel environmental toxins, this creates stress and developmental instability for the foetus, later leading to increased asymmetry in that individual. Greater exposure to pollution may also be a fundamental cause of FA. Research on skull characteristics of Baltic grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) demonstrated that those born after 1960 (marking an increase in environmental pollution) had increased levels of asymmetry. Also, shrews (Crocidura russula) from more polluted areas show higher levels of asymmetry. Radioactive contamination may also increase FA levels, as mice (Apodemus flavicollis) living closer to the failed Chernobyl reactor show greater asymmetry.  Developmental stability  Developmental stability is achieved when an organism is able to withstand genetic and environmental stress, to display the bilaterally symmetrical traits determined by its developmentally programmed phenotype. To measure an individual's developmental stability, the FA measurements of 10 traits are added together, including ear width, elbows, ankles, wrists, feet, length of ears and fingers. This is achieved by: (L - R)trait 1 + (L - R)trait 2 + ......(L - R)trait 10. This provides a good overall measure of body FA, as every individual has some features that are not perfectly symmetrical. Common environmental pressures leading to lower developmental stability include exposure to toxins, poison and infectious diseases, low food quality and malnutrition. Genetic pressures include spontaneous new mutations, and \\"bad genes\\" (genes that once had adaptive functions, but are being removed through evolutionary selection). A large fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and a low developmental stability suggests that an organism is unable to develop according to the ideal state of bilateral symmetry. The energy required for bilateral symmetry development is extremely high, making fully perfect bilateral symmetry functionally nonexistent in natural organic creatures. Energy is invested into survival in spite of the genetic and environmental pressures, before making bilaterally symmetrical traits. Research has also revealed links between FA and depression, genetic or environmental stress and measures of mate quality for sexual selection.Graham, J. H., D. C. Freeman and J. M. Emlen. 1993. Developmental stability: A sensitive indicator of populations under stress, pp. 1366158. /)I W. G. Landis, J. S. Hughes and M. A. Lewis (Eds.), Environmental Toxicology and Risk Assessment. American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA.Moller, A. P. 1994. Sexual Selection and the Barn Swallow. Oxford University Press. Oxford. Health =Susceptibility to diseases= Research has linked higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) to poorer outcomes in some domains of physical health in humans. For example, one study found that individuals with higher levels of FA report a higher number of medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA. However, they did not experience worse outcomes in areas such as systolic blood pressure or cholesterol levels. Higher levels of FA have also been linked to higher body mass index (BMI) in women, and lower BMI in men. Research has shown that both men and women with higher levels of FA, both facial and bodily, report a higher number of respiratory infections and a higher number of days ill, compared to men and women with lower levels of FA. In men, higher levels of FA have been linked to lower levels of physical attractiveness and higher levels of oxidative stress, regardless of smoking or levels of toxin exposure. There is no gender difference in the susceptibility of diseases depending on body FA.\\"Gangsted2006\\"> A large-scale review of the human and non-human literature by Møller found that higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry were linked to increased vulnerability to parasites, and also to lower levels of immunity to disease. A large-scale longitudinal study in Britain found that facial FA was not associated with poorer health over the course of childhood, which was interpreted as suggesting smaller effects of FA in Western societies with generally low levels of FA A review of the relationship between various attractiveness features and health in Western societies produced similar results, finding that symmetry was not related to health in either sex, but was related to attractiveness in males. =Health-risk behaviours= It has been suggested that individuals with lower levels of FA may engage in more biologically costly behaviours such as recreational drug use and risky body modifications such as piercings and tattoos. These ideas have been proposed in the context of Zahavi's handicap principle, which argues that highly costly behaviours or traits serve as signals of an organism's genetic quality. The relationship between FA and behaviours with high health risks has received mixed support. Individuals with body piercings and tattoos (which increase risk of blood-borne infections) have been shown to have lower levels of FA, but individuals with lower FA do not engage in any more recreational drug use than those with higher FA levels. =Mental health in humans= Higher levels of FA have been linked to higher levels of some mental health difficulties. For instance, it has been shown that, among university students, higher FA is associated with higher levels of schizotypy. Depression scores have been found to be higher in men, but not women, with higher levels of FA. One study by Shackelford and Larsen found that men and women with higher facial asymmetry reported more physiological complaints than those with lower facial asymmetry, and that both men and women with higher asymmetry experienced higher levels of psychological distress overall. For example, men with higher facial asymmetry experienced higher levels of depression compared to men with lower facial asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry has also been studied in relation to psychopathy. One study looking at offenders and non-offenders found that, although offenders had higher levels of FA overall, psychopathic offenders had lower levels of FA compared to offenders who did not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Additionally, offenders with the highest levels of psychopathy were found to have similar levels of FA to non-offenders. =Other health issues in humans= Research has also linked FA to conditions such as lower back pain, although the evidence is mixed. While one study found no notable link between pelvic asymmetry and lower back pain, other studies have found pelvic asymmetry (as well as FA in other traits not directly related to pelvic function) to be higher in patients experiencing lower back pain, and higher levels of FA have also been linked to congenital spinal problems. Studies have also shown increased levels of FA of ear length in individuals with cleft lip and/or non-syndromic cleft palate syndrome. =Physical fitness in humans= In addition to general health and susceptibility to disease, research has also studied the link between FA and physical fitness. Research has found that lower levels of lower-body FA is associated with faster running speeds in Jamaican sprinters, and individuals with greater body asymmetry have been shown to move more asymmetrically while running, although do not experience higher metabolic costs than more symmetrical individuals. It has also been shown that children with lower levels of lower-body FA have faster sprinting speeds and are more willing to sprint when followed up in adulthood. =Health in non-human populations= The relationship between FA, health and susceptibility to disease has also been studied in non-human animals. For example, studies have found that higher levels of facial asymmetry are associated with poorer overall health in female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and that higher FA is also linked to more health issues in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). The link between FA and health has also been investigated in non-primates. In three gazelle species (Gazella cuvieri; Gazella dama; Gazella dorcas), for instance, FA has been linked to a range of blood parameters associated with health in mammals, although the specific relevance of these blood parameters for these gazelle species was not examined. It has also been found that, among Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus), higher FA was slightly negatively related to both antler size and overall body mass (traits thought to indicate overall condition). Antlers more involved in fighting were found to be more symmetrical than those not involved, and antler asymmetry at reproductive age was lower than in development or at post-reproductive age. FA and health outcomes have been examined within insect populations. For instance, it has been found that Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) with higher levels of FA in three hind-limb traits have lower encapsulation rates, but do not differ from low-FA crickets in lytic activity (both are measures of immunocompetence). While research on the relationship between FA and longevity is sparse in humans, some studies using non-human populations have suggested an association between the symmetry of an organism and its lifespan. For instance, it has been found that flies whose wing veins showed more bilateral symmetry live longer than less symmetrical flies. This difference was greatest for male flies.  In sexual selection  = Mate attraction = Symmetry has been shown to affect physical attractiveness. Those with lower levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) are often rated as more attractive. Various studies have supported this. The relationship between FA and mate attraction has been studied in both males and females. As FA reflects developmental stability and quality, it has been suggested that we prefer those as more attractive/with low FA because it signals traits such as health and intelligence. Research has shown that the female partners of men with lower levels of FA experience a higher number of copulatory orgasms, compared to the female partners of males with higher levels of FA. Other studies have also found that the voices of men and women with low fluctuating asymmetry are rated as more attractive, suggesting that voice may be indicative of developmental stability. Research has shown attractiveness ratings of men's scent are negatively correlated with FA, but FA is unrelated to attractiveness ratings for women's scent, and women's preferences for the scent of more symmetric men appears limited to the most fertile phases of the menstrual cycle. However, research has failed to find changes in women's preferences for low FA across the menstrual cycle when assessing pictures of faces, as opposed to scents. Facial symmetry has been positively correlated with higher occurrences of mating. Also, one study used 3-D scans of male and female bodies, and showed videos of these scans to a group of individuals who rated the bodies on attractiveness. It was found that, for both males and females, lower levels of FA were associated with higher attractiveness ratings. It was also found that sex-typical joint configurations were rated as more attractive and linked to lower FA in men, but not women. Men with higher FA have been shown to have higher levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of attractiveness. Research has also provided evidence that FA is linked to extra-pair copulation, as women have been shown to prefer men with lower levels of FA as extra-pair partners. However, the literature is mixed regarding the relationship between attractiveness and FA. For example, in one study, altering images of faces to in a way that reduced asymmetry led to observers rating such faces as less, rather than more, attractive. Research by Van Dongen also found FA to be unrelated to attractiveness, physical strength and level of masculinity in both men and women. FA in Japanese scorpionflies (Panorpa japonica) is linked to fighting and mating success. =Sexual selection in non-human animals= Many non-human animals have been shown to be able to distinguish between potential partners, based upon levels of FA. As with humans, lower levels of FA are seen in the most reproductively successful members of species. For instance, FA of male forewing length seem to have an important role in successful mating for many insect species, such as dark-wing damselflies and Japanese scorpionflies. In the dark-winged damselfly (Calopteryx maculate), successfully mating male flies showed significantly lower levels of FA in their forewings than unsuccessful males, while for Japanese scorpionflies, FA levels are a good predictor for the outcome of fights between males in that more symmetrical males won significantly more fights. Other animals also show similar patterns, for example, many species of butterfly, males with lower levels of FA tended to live longer and flew more actively, allowing them to have more reproductive success. Also, female swallows have been shown to prefer longer, and more symmetrical tails as a cue for mate choice. Therefore, the males with longer and more symmetrical tails show higher levels of reproductive success with more attractive females. In red deer, sexual selection has affected antler development, in that larger and more symmetrical antlers are favoured in males at prime mating age. However, some evidence for the effects of sexual selection of FA levels have been inconsistent, suggesting that the relationship between FA and sexual selection may be more complex than originally thought. For instance, in the lekking black grouse and red junglefowl, no correlations were found between FA and mating success. Furthermore, when manipulating paradise whydahs' tails to be more and less symmetrical, females showed no preferences for more symmetrical tails (but they did show preferences for longer tails). Other associated factors  = Intelligence = Through research, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been found to have a negative correlation to measurements of human traits such as working memory and intelligence, such that individuals showing greater asymmetry have lower IQ scores. As FA links with both intelligence and facial attractiveness, it is possible that our perceptions of attractiveness have evolved based upon developmental quality, which includes traits such as intelligence and health. However, some literature shows no such correlations between FA and intelligence. A meta-analysis of the research covering this topic demonstrated that whilst published studies largely report negative correlations, unpublished studies often find no association between FA and intelligence. = Personality = Research into FA suggests that there may be some correlation to specific personality factors, in particular, the Big Five personality traits. From a general view, one would expect someone who is more symmetrical (usually meaning greater attractiveness), to be high on agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion and openness, and low on neuroticism. One of the most consistent findings reported is that low FA is positively associated with measures of extraversion, suggesting that more symmetrical people tend to be more extraverted than less symmetrical individuals, particularly when specifying to symmetry within the face. A correlation has also been reported between FA and human social dominance. However, research is proving less consistent with other personality factors, with some finding some weak correlations between low FA and conscientiousness and openness to experience, and others finding no significant differences between those with high or low FA. = Antisocial behaviours = Some studies suggest a link between FA and aggression, but the evidence is mixed. In humans, criminal offenders show greater FA than nonoffenders. However, other studies report that human males with higher FA show less physical aggression and less anger. Females show no association between FA and physical aggression, but some research has suggested that older female adolescents with higher facial FA are less hostile. The type of aggression being studied may account for the mixed evidence that is seen here. For example, one study found that females with higher FA demonstrated higher levels of reactive aggression in response to high levels of provocation, whereas high FA males showed more reactive aggression under low levels of provocation. Research is also mixed in other animals. In Japanese scorpionflies (Panorpa nipponensis and Panorpa ochraceopennis), FA differences between members of the same sex competing for food determines the outcome of interspecific contests and aggression better than body size or ownership of food. Furthermore, cannibalistic laying hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) demonstrate more asymmetry than normal hens. However, this link between FA and aggression in hens is questionable, as victimised hens also showed greater asymmetry. Furthermore, when prenatally injecting hen eggs with excess serotonin (5-HT), the hens later exhibited more FA at 18 weeks of age, but displayed less aggressive behaviours. It is suggested that the stress introduced during early embryonic stages via certain factors (such as excess serotonin) may create developmental instability, causing phenotypic and behavioural variations (such as increased or decreased aggression). =Aging= In old age, facial symmetry has been associated with better cognitive aging, as lower levels of FA have been associated with higher intelligence and more efficient information processing in older men. However, it has been found that risk of mortality cannot be predicted accurately from levels of FA in photographs of older adults. = Other factors = Additionally, FA has been shown to predict atypical asymmetry of the brain. Research has also shown that growth rates after birth positively correlate with FA. For example, increased FA has been found in people who were currently obese.

The first two were minions of Killmonger, an enemy of Black Panther. The third was a short-lived Ghost Rider villain. The fourth villain bearing the name Malice was a somewhat alternative personality of Susan Richards of the Fantastic Four. The last two villains bearing the name Malice are disembodied entities, the first of which became an evil doppelganger of Sue Richards who was absorbed into her own mind and the second is a mutant appearing in X-Men comics. Lupita Nyong'o portrays Nakia in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Black Panther (2018). Malice (Black Panther villain) The first Malice was one of Killmonger's mutated allies during his vie for the throne of Wakanda. Her first appearance was in Jungle Action, Vol. 2, #8 (Jan 1974). She fought T'Challa, the Black Panther alongside Venomm, Lord Karnaj, Baron Macabre, and others. She was a Wakandan mutate with superhuman strength, speed, and agility and was eventually defeated along with the rest of the villains attempting the coup.Jungle Action Vol.2, #17 Malice (Nakia) A second Black Panther-related Malice named Nakia () was introduced in Black Panther Vol. 3 #1 (November 1998) and was created by Christopher Priest and Mark Texeira. As a child, Nakia of the Q'Noma Valley marsh tribe was picked by her tribal elders to be Wakandan Dora Milaje, \\"Adored Ones\\" or wives-in-training and spent three years training before being presented to King T'Challa; barely a teenager, she was instantly smitten with him, although he promised that her role was purely ceremonial. She became close friends with her fellow Dora Milaje, Okoye who, unlike her, took satisfaction with being just his bodyguard. Nakia's obsession with King T'Challa increased dramatically when Mephisto cast an illusion over T'Challa causing him to kiss Nakia. She consequently became jealous of T'Challa's American ex-girlfriend Monica Lynne and plotted to kill her, but T'Challa rescued her and banished Nakia bringing great shame on her tribe and Wakanda.Black Panther Vol. 3 #11-12 Nakia was captured by Achebe and tortured by him until Erik Killmonger came and freed her.Black Panther Vol. 3 #23 Killmonger used the Altar of Resurrection on her and in the process gained enhanced abilities. Killmonger decided to name her Malice after the previous one. She went after T'Challa and his female allies and while battling Queen Divine Justice, killed one of T'Challa's allies, Nicole \\"Nikki\\" Adams.Black Panther Vol. 3 #24 She later teamed up with Man-Ape and kidnapped several of T'Challa's friends poisoning them out of revenge. Further, Nakia also planned on killing Monica and Dakota North, believing that the latter was also one of T'Challa's lovers. In the end, T'Challa foils the plan of Nakia, who manages to escape but not without giving him the antidote for his friends.Black Panther Vol. 3 #32-33 Nakia finally returned during a mission involving Everett K. Ross. When Ross is captured and tortured by the Hatut Zeraze (War Dogs), Nakia steps in to rescue him. Despite this, she is still in exile from the Dora Milaje.Black Panther Annual Vol. 2 #1 Embittered and cast out, Nakia developed an arsenal of weapons, including an herb named the jufeiro that gives her power over men. But longtime use of the drug made her grossly ill. In a desperate attempt to lure the Black Panther to her before she dies, Nakia tracked down a long forgotten Dora Milaje weapon called the Mimic-27 which can change and morph its shape and form as well as create ability-duplicating doppelgangers. She left Hydro-Man in charge of the A.I.M base where she nicked it from in case her hated sisterhood ever caught up with her.Spider-Man: Wakanda Forever #1 Nakia eventually decided to send Mimic-27 after T'Challa's ex-wife, Ororo Monroe (aka Storm of the X-Men), but the weapon broke free of Nakia's control and attacked her, too. To stop it, the Dora Milaje needed Nakia's help, but she refused to act until she could see her king again.X-Men: Wakanda Forever #1 After meeting up with her beloved T'Challa, the Wakandan King requested she aid the Dora Milaje in stopping the now out of control doomsday weapon running amok in Harlem, Massachusetts. She and her former sisterhood would travel to an Astral Plane where the consciousness of said Living Vibranium weapon was housed. While the heroes of New York battled the rogue Mimic's self created doppelgängers, Nakia and the other Dora's battled its tainted sentience which had been poisoned by her own malignance. Nakia gained the strength of self to overcome her mirror reflection and finally quelled the mimic, but died in the process as it was also holding back the cancerous element ravaging her body. In honor for her sacrifice, she was taken back to Wakanda and given a proper burial with full honors by the Black Panther and his Adored Ones, Spider-Man, and the X-Men along with a cadre of Avengers.Avengers: Wakanda Forever #1 Malice (Ghost Rider villain) The second villain to bear the name Malice first appeared in Ghost Rider #25 (August 1977). A showboater by nature, Malice made sure that his emergence was well televised. He burned a wax museum and left a woman to die as well as robbing a bank with his Vault Puller, one of the many devices he used to terrorize the police. While his secret identity is not known, there are suggestions that Malice is a wealthy individual, as he drives an AC Cobra and refers to hiding the money in the woods on his \\"estate.\\" He was arrested after being defeated by the Ghost Rider using an early predecessor to his penance stare. Malice, The Mistress of Hate Malice was a negative aspect of The Invisible Woman's own personality, awakened by the manipulations of the villain Psycho-Man at a time when her emotions were easily susceptible. Sue became pregnant for a second time; however, this pregnancy was even more difficult than the first and Sue eventually lost the child, causing great emotional strain on her. Psycho-Man decided to take advantage of the situation and amplified her negative emotions which resulted in her transformation into Malice, The Mistress of Hate. Malice retained the powers of Susan, but she used them more aggressively, creating explosions and deadly force field spikes. During her first appearance, she was able to use her powers to withstand a direct punch from She-Hulk who was unaware of her identity at the time, and without flinching, She-Hulk did not realize she had just struck a force field.Fantastic Four #280 Reed and Johnny only learned who she really was thanks to Daredevil's heightened senses causing him to perceive her as an amorphous blob due to the force field around her. With this revelation, Reed was able to restore her to normal by provoking her into a genuine temper rather than the artificially-created hate she felt due to the Psycho-Man, disrupting the emotional balance that the Psycho-Man's equipment relied on to affect her.Fantastic Four #281 The episode would have lasting effects: the Invisible Girl changed her name to Invisible Woman; she discovered how to use force objects and she lost a measure of self-confidence, knowing that Malice still lurked inside her. During an adventure where Susan and Reed helped the Silver Surfer resuscitate Galactus, Sue came in contact with the Infinity Gems. Distrustful of such power, she fell prey to Malice again.Silver Surfer Vol 3 #15 The soul gem tried and failed to combine Reed and Sue's souls, which brought forth the In-Betweener and sent Malice back to Sue's subconscious.Silver Surfer Vol 3 #16 Anthropomorpho Malice Later during the Infinity War when Adam Warlock's evil persona Magus attempted to conquer the universe, he used the alien species Anthropomorpho to create evil doppelgangers of Earth's heroes, Sue included.Fantastic Four #369 In order to subdue Susan the alien took the form of Malice, and Sue was only able to defeat the doppelganger by absorbing her into her own mind and incorporate its evil into herself. That boost allowed the negative aspect of Malice to regain control temporarily.Fantastic Four #371 Eventually, the Invisible Woman's son Franklin Richards expelled Malice from her mind and into his own.Fantastic Four #384 Later Sue and Franklin joined their minds to force Malice out of Franklin and into the mind of the Dark Raider, an insane alternate universe counterpart of Mister Fantastic, however the Dark Raider managed to control and negate Malice's influence.Fantastic Four #392 Malice was apparently soon destroyed when the Dark Raider died shortly thereafter in the Negative Zone.Fantastic Four #399 The Malice persona was briefly resurrected by the Psycho-Man when he collaborated with the mysterious Quiet Man who had been nurturing a grudge against the Fantastic Four for years. The Quiet Man had a crush on Sue before she met Reed but never had the nerve to talk to her. He hoped to use Malice's ruthlessness to make Susan act uncharacteristically violent in order to encourage judges in court to take her children away. However, Sue eventually overcame the worst of the programming, and the Psycho- Man subsequently removed Malice's influence when Sue threatened to use that anger against him. Malice (Marauder) The supervillain Malice was created by Uncanny X-Men writer Chris Claremont. She is a member of Mister Sinister's Marauders. Being incorporeal, she has no physical body of her own and has to possess the body of others. Those she possesses manifest a cameo-like choker around their neck. It is implied that the choker is a vessel for Malice's psychic energy form and destroying the choker can disperse her energy form for a short period of time. Malice body hops through a number of X-Men, including Dazzler, Wolverine, Rogue and Storm. Storm's will is too strong, and she forcibly ejects Malice from her body.Uncanny X-Men #214 (Feb 1987) After possessing Polaris, she singlehandedly defeats all her Marauders teammates, earning her a place as the field leader of the Marauders.Uncanny X-Men #219 (July 1987) A side effect occurs that Malice did not expect; Malice's and Polaris' energy matrices interweave and the two women become permanently bonded together. Mr. Sinister had known this union would occur, but did not warn Malice of it because he had wanted to use it to ensure Polaris would remain his prisoner/slave.Uncanny X-Men #239 (December 1988) After Mister Sinister is seemingly killed by Cyclops, Malice's hold over Polaris weakens.Uncanny X-Men #249 (October 1989) Polaris' alleged half-sister Zaladane, a priestess for the Savage Land's Sun People, uses the High Evolutionary's machinery to strip Polaris of her magnetic powers and take them as her own; the process also finally separates Polaris and Malice. X-Men Unlimited #6 Malice resurfaces years later to bother Polaris once more. She possesses Havok and tries to kill Polaris so she can get her revenge against Sinister, from whom she was trying to break free. In the end, Sinister asks Malice to possess Polaris once again, knowing that Lorna would not object to the possession in order to save Havok. However, out of their love for each other, Havok and Polaris each try to absorb Malice, preventing the other from being possessed. Malice is then apparently destroyed by Sinister himself.X-Factor #105 Later Scalphunter and Arclight explain to an imprisoned Threnody, a former ally of Mister Sinister who tried to escape him, that no one has ever escaped from Mister Sinister. They remind her about how Mister Sinister killed Malice.X-Man #19 Malice later returns as a digital entity instead of a psionic one, taking possession of Karima Shapandar (Omega Sentinel) by a computer virus via e-mail.X-Men #200 Emma Frost soon becomes aware of another being within Omega Sentinel but is nevertheless taken by surprise when Malice attacks and sedates her. The other X-Men continue to be unaware of Malice possessing Karima until they are attacked by her and the rest of the new Marauders. Later, she fights alongside the other Marauders in Flint, Michigan, against Iceman and Cannonball, as both sides try to obtain the Diaries of Destiny.X-Men #203 In X-Men: Messiah Complex, Malice travels to Cooperstown, Alaska along with fellow Marauders Sunfire, Gambit, Prism, Blockbuster, Lady Mastermind, and Scalphunter. They try to find the baby but instead come across a small army of Purifiers and they come to blows, devastating the town. The next time she is seen, the five member assault task force of X-Men invades the Marauders base, and is forced to fight Colossus along with Arclight, Frenzy, and Unuscione. She then teams up with Lady Mastermind in taking out Wolverine by throwing an unconscious Scrambler disguised as Angel at him. After he realizes the deception, she hits him with a powerful microwave energy blast. Nightcrawler teleports in and knocks her out along with Lady Mastermind. A squad consisting of Malice, Gambit, Sunfire, and Vertigo confront Bishop who is about to kill the baby. The Marauder team defeat Bishop and Malice seems to show a lot of affection towards the baby and finds it extraordinary that the baby girl isn't scared at all when she picks her up. During the final battle on Muir Island, Malice along with all of Sinister's army excluding Gambit and Mystique ambush X-Force. When X-Force is soon joined by the X-Men, Predator X, and the New X-Men, Cyclops allows the New X-Men to tackle the Marauders. Malice is skeptical when it comes to fighting children but is unpleasantly surprised with the tenacity of the youngsters. She goes on to battle Pixie, beating her with her bare fists, until Pixie fights back and guts Malice with her Souldagger. It appears that the dagger exorcises Malice from Omega Sentinel, but Karima has no memory of the events that took place in the last two and a half weeks, apparently a side effect of being possessed by Malice. Malice has since made her presence known in New York where she starts to possess people until Cyclops is able to detect her (possible with the help of Cerebra). While tracking her on a subway train he runs into a fight with the Superior Spider-Man. Malice possesses Cyclops for a few seconds before she is knocked unconscious by the Superior Spider- Man. He takes the possessed Cyclops to his lab and separates Malice from him, putting her in a containment box that he gives to Cyclops.A+X #11 =Other versions= In the alternate reality depicted in What If?, Vol. 2, #74 (June 1995), a version of Malice appears, possessing Madelyne Pryor (a clone of Jean Grey) as a member of Mister Sinister's X-Men. She appears in the form of a neck choker.What If vol. 2 #74 In the possible future that depicted X-Men: The End, the Malice choker was in possession of the renegade Sage.X-Men: The End: Book 1: Dreamers & Demons #3 Obsessed with learning all things possible, she used Malice to datamine as many people as possible and then acquire the knowledge Malice gathered. Some of the X-Men were sent after Sage, but the hyper-intelligent mutant was ready for them and laid a trap. She managed to clip the choker around X-23's neck and Malice briefly possessed her, acquiring all the knowledge of the girl. Sage was caught soon after though and Malice was taken off her, putting a stop to her plans.X-Men: The End: Book 2: Heroes & Martyrs #4 In the reality depicted in X-Men Forever, Malice was used to take control over the alien Hepzibah. The Marauders were sent after the young Nate Grey and Hepzibah was used as a vessel to get close to the child.X-Men Forever 2 #7 Lockheed figured out she was possessed and attacked her, alerting Polaris, who recognized Malice's trademark choker. Polaris ripped the choker off Hepzibah and left it lying on the ground, where it was picked up by Mystique.X-Men Forever 2 #8 An alternate version of Malice appeared in league with the New Marauders, a team displaced from their native universe (Earth-1610) and assembled by Miss Sinister; this version of Malice exists in the form of a necklace instead of a choker; it was in the possession of the time displaced version of Jean Grey and was abandoned when Grey and the rest of her team went to space to rescue Cyclops' father. When Polaris found the necklace, Malice was able to possessed her and used Polaris to attack the Raksha, a group of local vigilantes that were visiting the X-Mansion, but because Polaris had already fallen victim by the prime version of Malice, she was eventually able to snap out of her control and broke free which destroyed the necklace,X-Men: Blue #24 and seemingly killing the entity in the process.X-Men: Blue #25 In other media =Television= * Susan Richards appears as Malice in the 1994 Fantastic Four episode \\"Worlds Within Worlds\\". Malice's appearance is the result of Psycho-Man using his powers to make Susan turn against her Fantastic Four teammates. Eventually, Susan is freed of Psycho-Man's influence and defeats him. * Nakia had a silent cameo in Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes as part of T'Challa's Dora Milaje. =Film= Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia in a character poster for the 2018 film Black Panther. Lupita Nyong'o plays Nakia in the 2018 film Black Panther. This version of Nakia does not fill a villainous role and is a former Dora Milaje who became a War Dog; an international spy for Wakanda. She was once in a relationship with T'Challa that seemed to end mutually, though it is clear that they still have feelings for each other. Nakia only returns to Wakanda upon hearing that T'Challa's father, T'Chaka, passed away. She stays after T'Challa is crowned king and asks that she accompany him to one of their missions, leading into the major events of the film. After Erik Killmonger seizes the throne and orders the heart-shaped herbs which grant the power of the Black Panther to be burned, Nakia steals one. Although Queen Mother Ramonda urges Nakia to consume it in order to challenge Killmonger, Nakia plans to offer it to M'Baku of the Mountain tribe so that he can challenge Killmonger with his army. M'Baku reveals that his people have recovered T'Challa, so Nakia gives the herb to him, healing him and restoring his powers as the Black Panther. Nakia then assists in the insurrection against Killmonger, dressing as a Dora Milaje soldier at Shuri's insistence. At the end of the film, Nakia agrees to resume her relationship with T'Challa and accepts a position running a Wakandan outreach center in California at the location of N'Jobu and Killmonger's former apartment. =Video games= Nakia appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2.

It is one of six extraocular muscles that control the movements of the eye. The lateral rectus muscle is responsible for lateral movement of the eyeball, specifically abduction. Abduction describes the movement of the eye away from the midline (i.a. nose), allowing the eyeball to move horizontally in the lateral direction, bringing the pupil away from the midline of the body. Structure The lateral rectus originates at the lateral part of the annulus of Zinn, also known as the annular tendon or common tendinous ring, and inserts into the temporal side of the eyeball. The annulus of Zinn is a tendinous ring that surrounds the optic nerve and serves as the origin for five of the six extraocular muscles, excluding the inferior oblique muscle. =Nerve supply= It is the only muscle supplied by the abducens nerve, cranial nerve VI. The abducens nerve exits the brainstem from the pons- medullary junction, and travels through the superior orbital fissure to innervate the lateral rectus muscle. The lateral rectus muscle is innervated through the tectospinal tract. This tract begins in the tectum region of the midbrain, and crosses to the contralateral side of the midbrain. The tectospinal tract descends through the brainstem to the upper spinal cord, but goes no further than the neck. This tract is involved with both upper and lower motor neurons, as well as in the reflex of turning the head in response to visual and auditory stimulus. Part of the descending tracts carry motor signals down the brainstem and spinal cord. Function It causes outward movement of the eyeball, also called as abduction. Clinical significance A sixth nerve palsy, also known as abducens nerve palsy, is a neurological defect that results from a damaged or impaired abducens nerve. This damage can stem from stroke, trauma, tumor, inflammation, and infection. Damage to the abducens nerve by trauma can be caused by any type of trauma that causes elevated intracranial pressure; including hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury with intracranial bleeding, tumors, and lesions along the nerve at any point between the pons and lateral rectus muscle in orbit. This defect can result in horizontal double vision and reduced lateral movement. The lateral rectus muscle will be denervated and paralyzed and the patient will be unable to abduct the eye. For example, if the left abducens nerve is damaged, the left eye will not abduct fully. While attempting to look straight ahead, the left eye will be deviated medially towards the nose due to the unopposed action of the medial rectus of the eye. Proper function of the lateral rectus is tested clinically by asking the patient to look laterally. Depending on the underlying cause of the lateral rectus palsy, some improvement may occur naturally over time. While the prognosis for a lateral rectus palsy onset by a viral illness is generally positive, the prognosis for an onset of trauma or tumor is quite poor. Ultimately, nerves are not very good at regenerating or healing themselves, so if the damage is severe there will be permanent damage. In addition, another disorder associated with the lateral rectus muscle is Duane Syndrome. This syndrome occurs when the sixth cranial nerve which controls the lateral rectus muscle does not develop properly. It is believed that Duane Syndrome is a result of a disturbance of normal embryonic development due to a genetic or an environmental factor.

The inferior oblique is an extraocular muscle, and is attached to the maxillary bone (origin) and the posterior, inferior, lateral surface of the eye (insertion). The inferior oblique is innervated by the inferior branch of the oculomotor nerve. Structure The inferior oblique arises from the orbital surface of the maxilla, lateral to the lacrimal groove. Unlike the other extraocular muscles (recti and superior oblique), the inferior oblique muscle does not originate from the common tendinous ring (annulus of Zinn). Passing lateralward, backward, and upward, between the inferior rectus and the floor of the orbit, and just underneath the lateral rectus muscle, the inferior oblique inserts onto the scleral surface between the inferior rectus and lateral rectus. In humans, the muscle is about 35 mm long. =Innervation= The inferior oblique is innervated by the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). Function Its actions are extorsion, elevation and abduction of the eye. Primary action is extorsion (external rotation); secondary action is elevation; tertiary action is abduction (i.e. it extorts the eye and moves it upward and outwards). The field of maximal inferior oblique elevation is in the adducted position. The inferior oblique muscle is the only muscle that is capable of elevating the eye when it is in a fully adducted position. Clinical significance While commonly affected by palsies of the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve, isolated palsies of the inferior oblique (without affecting other functions of the oculomotor nerve) are quite rare. \\"Overaction\\" of the inferior oblique muscle is a commonly observed component of childhood strabismus, particularly infantile esotropia and exotropia.

Surgical procedures of the inferior oblique include: loosening (also known as recession see Strabismus surgery), myectomy, marginal myotomy, and denervation and extirpation. It is also encountered and identified in lower lid blepharoplasty surgeries.

After his death, he gained notoriety from allegations made by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison that he had been involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He was an avid anti-communist, alleged member of the Minutemen, the John Birch Society, Louisiana Committee on Un-American Activities, and alleged publisher of the Louisiana Intelligence Digest. He also supported various anti-Castro groups in the New Orleans area: \\"Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front\\"; \\"Anti- Communist League of the Caribbean\\"; \\"Friends of Democratic Cuba\\". According to the New Orleans States-Item newspaper, Banister \\"participated in every anti- Communist South and Central American revolution that came along, acting as a key liaison man for the U.S. government-sponsored anti-Communist activities in Latin America.\\"New Orleans States-Item, May 5, 1967.  Early life  Banister was born in Monroe, Louisiana, the oldest of seven children. After studying at the Louisiana State University, he joined the Monroe Police Department.HSCA: Material received from files of New Orleans district attorney's office pertaining to investigation and trial of Clay Shaw, 1967-69, attachment D, section 5, regarding Guy Banister, \\"Biographical Sketch\\" (JFK Document 007271).  Law enforcement career  In 1934, Banister joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was present at the killing of John Dillinger. Originally based in Indianapolis, he later moved to New York City where he was involved in the investigation of the American Communist Party. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was impressed by Banister's work and, in 1938, he was promoted to run the FBI unit in Butte, Montana. He also served in Oklahoma City, Minneapolis and Chicago. In Chicago, he was the Special Agent in Charge for the FBI. He retired from the FBI in 1954. Banister moved to Louisiana and, in January 1955, became Assistant Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department, where he was given the task of investigating organized crime and corruption within the police force. It later emerged that he was also involved in looking at the role that left-wing political activists were playing in the struggle for civil rights in New Orleans.Malcolm X: Make It Plain / Full Documentary \\" Best MCee Ever\\" - Rap Music - Zimbio On the campuses of Tulane University and Louisiana State University, he ran a network of informants collecting information on \\"communist\\" activities. He submitted reports on his findings to the FBI through contacts. In March 1957, Banister was suspended after pulling a gun in public in a bar and threatening a waiter.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 225. His suspension ended in June of that year. However, when he refused to be transferred to the N.O.P.D.'s Planning Department, he was dismissed from the force.  Private investigation, Cuba, Oswald, Marcello  After leaving the New Orleans Police Department, Banister established his own private detective agency, Guy Banister Associates, Inc. at 434 Balter Building.David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations - Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 110. In June 1960, Banister moved his office to 531 Lafayette Street on the ground floor of the Newman Building. Around the corner but located in the same building, with a different entrance, was the address 544 Camp Street, which would later be found stamped on Fair Play for Cuba Committee leaflets distributed by Lee Harvey Oswald, the suspected assassin of President John F. Kennedy. The Newman Building housed militant anti-Castro groups, including the Cuban Revolutionary Council (October 1961 to February 1962), as well as Sergio Arcacha Smith's Crusade to Free Cuba Committee. Banister's office was within walking distance of the New Orleans offices of the FBI, CIA, Office of Naval Intelligence and the Reily Coffee Company (Lee Harvey Oswald's employer and a supporter of anti-Castro Cubans).Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), pp. 220-221, 226. Douglass, James. JFK and the Unspeakable, (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2008), pp. 61-62. 1959 Guy Banister Associates, Inc. Yellow Pages advertisement, New Orleans Telephone Directory. Banister was implicated in a 1961 raid on a munitions depot in Houma, Louisiana, in which \\"various weapons, grenades and ammunition were stolen ... which were reportedly seen stacked in Banister's back room by several witnesses.\\" The New Orleans States-Item newspaper reported an allegation that Banister served as a munitions supplier for the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and continued to deal weapons from his office until 1963.New Orleans States-Item, April 25, 1967 In 1962, Banister allegedly dispatched an associate, Maurice Brooks Gatlin — legal counsel of Banister's \\"Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean\\" — to Paris to deliver a suitcase containing $200,000 for the French OAS. In 1963, Banister and anti-Castro activist David Ferrie began working for a lawyer named G. Wray Gill and his client, New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello. This involved attempts to block Marcello's deportation to Guatemala.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 240. In early 1962, Banister assisted David Ferrie in a dispute with Eastern Airlines regarding charges brought against Ferrie by the airline and New Orleans police of \\"crimes against nature and extortion.\\" During this period, Ferrie was frequently seen at Banister's office.David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations - Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, p. 111. Banister served as a character witness for Ferrie at his airline pilot's grievance board hearing in the summer of 1963.  JFK assassination and trial of Clay Shaw  On the afternoon of November 22, 1963, the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Banister and one of his investigators, Jack Martin, were drinking together at the Katzenjammer Bar, located next door to 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. On their return to Banister's office, the two men got into a dispute. Banister believed that Martin had stolen some files and drew his .357 Magnum revolver, striking Martin with it several times. During the altercation Martin yelled: \\"What are you going to do — kill me like you all did Kennedy?\\" Martin was badly injured and treated at Charity Hospital. Over the next few days, Martin told authorities and reporters that anti-Castro activist David Ferrie had been involved in the assassination. He claimed that Ferrie knew Oswald from their days in the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol, and that Ferrie might have taught Oswald how to use a rifle with a telescopic sight.FBI interview of Jack S. Martin, November 25, 1963 & November 27, 1963, Warren Commission Document No. 75, pp. 217-18, 309-11. Martin also claimed that Ferrie drove to Texas on the day of Kennedy's assassination, to serve as a getaway pilot for the assassins.David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations - Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 12, pp. 112-13. Witnesses interviewed by the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations indicate Banister was \\"aware of Oswald and his Fair Play for Cuba Committee before the assassination.\\" Banister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, told author Anthony Summers that Oswald \\"seemed to be on familiar terms with Banister and with [Banister's] office.\\" Roberts said, \\"As I understood it, he had the use of an office on the second floor, above the main office where we worked. Then, several times, Mr. Banister brought me upstairs, and in the office above I saw various writings stuck up on the wall pertaining to Cuba. There were various leaflets up there pertaining to Fair Play for Cuba.'\\"Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 229. The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated Roberts' claims and said that \\"the reliability of her statements could not be determined.\\" The alleged activities of Banister, Ferrie and Oswald reached New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison who, by late 1966, had become very interested in the New Orleans aspects of the assassination. In December 1966, Garrison interviewed Martin about these activities. Martin claimed that Banister, Ferrie and a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles were involved in operations against Castro's Cuba that included gun running and burglarized armories.Garrison, Jim. On The Trail of the Assassins, (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1988), p. 40. As Garrison continued his investigation, he became convinced that a group of right-wing activists, including Banister, Ferrie and Clay Shaw, were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to kill Kennedy. Garrison would later claim that the motive for the assassination was anger over Kennedy's attempts to obtain a peace settlement in both Cuba and Vietnam.Jim Garrison Interview, Playboy magazine, Eric Norden, October 1967.Garrison, Jim. On The Trail of the Assassins, (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1988), pp. 12-13, 43, 176-178, 277, 293. Garrison also believed that Banister, Shaw, and Ferrie had conspired to set up Oswald as a patsy in the JFK assassination.Garrison, Jim. On The Trail of the Assassins, (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1988), pp. 26-27, 62, 70, 106-110, 250, 278, 289.  Post JFK  Banister's publication, the Louisiana Intelligence Digest, maintained that the civil rights movement was part of an international communist conspiracy and was treasonous.  Death  Banister died of coronary thrombosis on June 6, 1964. Banister's files went to various people after his death.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 227. Later, New Orleans Assistant District Attorney Andrew Sciambra interviewed Banister's widow.

The book was subsequently adapted into the 1944 film of the same name starring Spencer Tracy, Van Johnson and Robert Mitchum. Early life Lawson was born in Alameda, California and attended Los Angeles City College in 1937-1938. He joined the U.S. Army Air Corps as an aviation cadet in March 1940 while a student studying aeronautical engineering by day and working nights in the drafting department of Douglas Aircraft Company. After basic flight instruction at Hancock Field, Santa Maria, California, Lawson attended primary flying training at Randolph Field and advanced training at Kelly Field, receiving his pilot's wings and commission as a Second Lieutenant on 15 November 1940.\\"Ted W. Lawson: Biography.\\" imdb.com. Retrieved: February 3, 2010. Lawson was assigned to the 95th Bomb Squadron, 17th Bomb Group (Medium) at McChord Field, Washington. He was assigned as a co-pilot flying B-18 Bolo medium bombers and checked out in the Douglas B-23 Dragon. He became a first pilot in February 1941 and two months later the group received seven B-25 Mitchells, the first of the new medium bombers to be assigned to a unit in the Air Corps. While his squadron was based at McChord, Lawson married Ellen Arlene Reynolds, a librarian at LACC he had met while a student, in Spokane on 5 September 1941. His best man at the ceremony was squadron-mate Lt. Robert M. Gray, who would be a fellow pilot on the Doolittle Raid. World War II Lawson's aircraft (foreground) and other B-25s on deck of the USS Hornet In early 1942, Lawson, then a First Lieutenant, was flying antisubmarine patrols with the 17th BG out of Pendleton, Oregon. As the first Army Air Corps group to receive the B-25 Mitchell, the 17th BG had the most experienced pilots and so was ordered from Oregon to Lexington County Army Air Base at Columbia, South Carolina, ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the East Coast of the United States but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \\"extremely hazardous\\" but unspecified mission. On 17 February the group was detached from the Eighth Air Force. Lieutenant Lawson was accepted as a volunteer for the mission led by then-Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle to bomb Tokyo and several other cities with 16 carrier-launched B-25 Mitchell bombers from aboard the USS Hornet (CV-8) - the first air raid on mainland Japan during World War II following the Pearl Harbor attack. The aircraft that he flew on the raid was nicknamed \\"The Ruptured Duck\\" (AAF serial 40-2261). According to Lawson in his book, the plane's unusual name evolved from a minor training accident where the aircraft tail scraped the ground on take-off. Soon after Lawson found someone had written \\"ruptured duck\\" in chalk on the fuselage. Inspired, he had B-25 gunner Cpl. Rodger Lovelace create the now- famous caricature of Donald Duck with crutches and pilot's headphones. After launching the mission 170 miles (275 km) further out than planned and bombing their targets in Japan, all of the aircraft ran out of fuel short of their intended recovery airfields in non-Japanese occupied China. Lawson and his crew crashed their plane off the coast of the small island of Nantien when its engines failed while trying to land on the beach during a storm. Lawson and his co-pilot were both thrown through the windscreen of the B-25, with Lawson suffering a compound fracture of the left leg, a lacerated left bicep, and severe facial injuries in the process. All five crew members survived the crash; however all but flight engineer/gunner David J. Thatcher received serious injuries. Bombardier Robert Clever would be returned to the U.S., only to die in another plane crash in November, 1942. After he was transported by friendly Chinese throughout several provinces in China to evade Japanese troops searching for his crew, Lawson's infected leg was amputated by the mission's flight surgeon, Lt Thomas R. White, who had volunteered to fly the mission as a gunner on the crew of Lt. Donald Smith. The nose art of the crashed bomber, \\"The Ruptured Duck\\", was later salvaged by the Japanese and put on display in Tokyo. =Author= Title page of 1943 Random House first edition In January 1943, Lawson and newspaper columnist Bob Considine decided to write a book about the mission, entitled Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. In four nights and two days in the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., the entire story was worked out, although approval to publish the book was not given until after information about the raid was released by the War Department in April 1943. Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo first appeared serialized in six issues of Collier's magazine, from May 22 to June 26, 1943. It was also published later that year by Random House in a 220-page hardback \\"wartime book\\" (5 1/4\\" x 7 3/4\\") format. Through friends in the Los Angeles area, Ted made contact with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer producer Sam Zimbalist, and the movie was launched in 1944. The film starred Van Johnson as Lawson, alongside Spencer Tracy and Robert Mitchum. It won an Academy Award for Best Special Effects.. Retrieved: November 19, 2011.

Retrieved: February 3, 2010. Later life Along with the majority of the surviving Doolittle Raiders, Lawson was eventually repatriated back to the United States, and in his case, for further medical care including a second amputation of his injured leg and reconstruction of his lower face. During his recuperation, Lawson was promoted to captain in accordance with Doolittle's recommendation that all the raiders be promoted one grade, and later to major. He served as Liaison Officer, U.S. Air Mission, Santiago, Chile from May 1943 until April 1944. He was retired from the U.S. Army Air Forces for physical disability on February 2, 1945. His decorations include the Distinguished Flying Cross, Purple Heart, and the Chinese Army, Navy, and Air Corps Medal, Class A, 1st Grade. After the war, Lawson owned and operated a machine shop in Southern California, and also worked for Reynolds Metals as a liaison between the company and the military. He died at his home in Chico, California on January 19, 1992 and was interred at the Chico Cemetery Mausoleum. Honors and tributes Lawson Army Airfield at Fort Benning, Georgia is partially named for Ted W. Lawson. It was originally named only for Walter R. Lawson (no relation to Ted), an Army Air Corps flyer who earned the Distinguished Service Cross in World War I. Several years later, after the Doolittle Raid in World War II, Ted W. Lawson's name was added to the memorial at the field.\\"Walter Ralls Lawson Sr., Captain, United States Army Air Service.\\" Arlington National Cemetrary.

History Until 1962 it was designated the 8 inch Howitzer M1. The original design started in 1919 but lapsed until resurrected in 1927 as a partner-piece for a new 155 mm gun. It was standardized as 8 inch Howitzer M1 in 1940. The M115/M1 was towed by the M35 Prime Mover gun tractor or a Mack 7⅓ ton 6×6 truck. The M115 was towed with 21 men per gun, and was shipped over to Germany Oct 1961 in response to the Berlin Crisis. Like the British BL 8 inch Howitzer of the First World War (and most other large artillery), the M115 uses a Welin screw for its breech. The carriage was the same as used for the US 155 mm gun and was also adopted by the British for their 7.2 inch howitzer. It consists of equilibrator assemblies, elevating and traversing mechanisms, two single-wheel, single-axle heavy limber, and a two-axle bogie with eight tires and two trails. Four spades, carried on the trails, are used to emplace the weapon. The British 8 inch howitzer was produced in England and under license in the US, for the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during World War I, as the 8-inch Howitzer MK. VI.US Army manual TM 9-2005, December 1942 Page 79 It was in service with the US Army till replaced by the M115. There are no reports of the MK. VI or another marks being used during World War II. The first photos of the M115 type 8 inch cannon on its redesign carriage appeared in 1931 but development was slowed by the Great Depression.\\"First Mile A Minute Army\\", October 1931, Popular Science photo bottom of page 53 The M115 saw U.S. service in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In the late 1950s, it was adopted in small numbers by several NATO armies, to fire the W33 (M422/M422A1 shell) and later the W79 nuclear artillery shell, under the NATO nuclear sharing concept, a role which ended when the smallest types of tactical nuclear weapons were removed from service and eliminated. It was also adopted as a field weapon by a number of nations in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia and saw service in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis and the Croatian War of Independence.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1930 to 1955, and was a prominent cabinet minister in the governments of John Bracken, Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell. The son of Frank Albert Schultz and Margaret MacPhail, Schultz was educated at Wesley College and the University of Manitoba. He was called to the Manitoba Bar in 1920 and worked as a barrister, beginning his own practice at Baldur in 1921. He was a member of the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, and was appointed a King's Counsel. Schultz served on the Baldur school board and the Baldur town board from 1922 to 1936. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election on January 29, 1930, in the rural constituency of Mountain. The circumstances of Schultz's election were significant for the emerging alliance of Liberals and Progressives in the Manitoba legislature. Schultz, a Liberal, won by acclamation when the Progressives declined to nominate a candidate. The parties created a formal alliance in the legislature two years later, and eventually became known simply as \\"Liberal-Progressives\\". Schultz easily defeated a Conservative opponent in the 1932 election, and a Social Credit opponent in the 1936 election. He was appointed to cabinet on September 21, 1936 as Minister of Education in John Bracken's government. Returned by acclamation in the 1941 provincial election, Schultz was transferred to the Ministry of Health on February 5, 1944, by Stuart Garson, who had succeeded Bracken as Premier of Manitoba one year earlier. Schultz easily defeated a candidate of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in the 1945 election, and was returned by acclamation again in 1949. After another cabinet shuffle on November 7, 1952, Schultz was named as Attorney General of Manitoba. He was easily re-elected in the 1953 election, and stepped down from cabinet and the legislature on January 22, 1955 when he was appointed as a judge in the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba. Schultz was one of the most important figures in the legislature during the 1940s and 1950s. Like most others in the Liberal- Progressive Party, he was essentially conservative in his political views and reluctant to legislate progressive changes. He opposed increases in Mothers' Allowances in the 1940s, and opposed penal reform even prior to his appointment as Attorney General.

It was founded in 1854 as a women's college. History Woman's College of Alabama in 1918 Huntingdon College was chartered on February 2, 1854, as \\"Tuskegee Female College\\" by the Alabama State Legislature and Governor John A. Winston. The first president was Andrew Adgate Lipscomb. Dr. Lipscomb laid the foundation of the college as a teaching college rather than a research institution. In 1872 the name was changed to \\"Alabama Conference Female College,\\" as the college came under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church. As the college and the South struggled to rebuild following the Civil War, college leaders believed they needed to relocate the institution to a more populous city, and they chose the state's capital, Montgomery. In 1908 they purchased a 58-acre (235,000 m²) parcel of land on what was then the outskirts of town; it is now part of the Old Cloverdale neighborhood of Montgomery. The campus landscaping was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., who had also planned the Biltmore Estate and Central Park. The college, renamed as \\"Woman's College of Alabama,\\" moved all of its furniture, lab chemicals, and records into Hamner Hall in Montgomery on August 24, 1909. The building burned to the ground that night, destroying the records of the college's first 50 years and all of its furnishings. The students and President William Martin moved to Sullins College in Virginia for that school year, and construction continued on the college's first building, John Jefferson Flowers Memorial Hall. Completed in 1910 and designed by Harvard architect H. Langford Warren, Flowers Hall was designed to emulate the collegiate Gothic architecture of Oxford and Cambridge universities in England, and of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It set the tone that was followed for the architectural style of the campus. The college admitted its first male students in the aftermath of World War I, graduating the first male student in 1934. Realizing that the name Woman's College of Alabama no longer fit its student body, the college was renamed in 1935 as Huntingdon College, in honor of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, a notable supporter of John Wesley and of Methodism. In the early 21st century, Huntingdon offers more than 50 undergraduate programs of study and 18 NCAA-III intercollegiate athletic teams that participate in the USA South Athletic Conference. Between 2002 and 2012, enrollment increased by 53% in the traditional day program and 88% overall (594 to 1118). The Chronicle of Higher Education listed Huntingdon in 2014 among the \\"Fastest Growing Colleges in America.\\" Campus Huntingdon's campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Huntingdon College Campus Historic District. The district contains thirteen contributing buildings, built in the Gothic Revival and Tudor Revival styles, and one site. See also: The district was placed on the NRHP on February 24, 2000. The College expanded across Fairview Avenue, adding the Cloverdale Campus in 2001.

It is on the site of an Augustinian priory founded in 1113 which was dissolved during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1951 it was designated a Grade I Listed Building. History =Foundation= Bridlington Priory was founded around 1113 by Walter de Gant, for Augustinian Canons Regular, one of the earliest Augustinian houses in England, with an adjoining convent. Its foundation was confirmed in charters by King Henry I of England The site had formerly been a Saxon church and nunnery. When complete, the building was over and , with a transept which was . The first prior is thought to have been called Guicheman or Wickeman. =Early history= The priory was favoured by kings and their nobles and soon owned land across Yorkshire. The Canons from the priory established Newburgh Priory in 1145. King Stephen granted that the priory should have the right to have the property of felons and fugitives within the town and proceeds from the harbour, and later King John gave the priory the right to hold a yearly fair in the town in 1200. During the conflict between Stephen and Matilda, William le Gros, Earl of Albemarle (a Manor in Holderness which is now ‘lost’) advanced on the priory and expelled the canons in his campaign against Gilbert de Gant of Hunmanby. He fortified the priory and later gave the priory six parcels of land, one at Boynton and the rest in Holderness. Henry IV appropriated the rectory of Scarborough to the priory which was later confirmed by Henry V, Henry VI and Edward IV. A royal licence was also granted by Richard II in 1388 to crenellate the priory with fortifications but although history tells there were four gates, 3 of those gates were in the main priory land, Kirk Gate, West Gate, Nun Gate and these were used as daily entrances in and out of the building enclosure itself. Only the Baylegate was a fortified entrance standing at the borders and the Priory itself was in fact never walled. The priory also had a large library, which was listed by John Leland shortly before the dissolution. =Dissolution of the Monasteries= The priory was dissolved in 1538 by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The priory was very wealthy at the time of the dissolution and its yearly income was estimated to be , and owned land stretching from Blubberhouses in the north, and Askham Richard, down to the Spurn Point. Bridlington Priory from the south-west The condition of the priory at the dissolution can be gathered from the report of Richard Pollard, a surveyor of Henry VIII.John Caley, 'Survey of the Priory of Bridlington', Archaeologia, vol. 19 (London, 1821), pp. 270-275 The Church was more than 390 feet in length, surrounded by the Chapter House, Treasury, Cloister, Prior's Hall, Infirmary. The Quire of the mediaeval church contained woodwork by the celebrated William Brownflete (or Bromflete) who had made the stalls in Beverley Minster, Manchester Cathedral and Ripon Cathedral and a number of churches under the patronage of The Lady Margaret Beaufort, including Gresford and Mold churches, and the chapel of St. John's College Cambridge. All the buildings were destroyed except the Nave which became the parish church and the Gatehouse, which is now the Bayle Gate Museum. Some of the stones from the old priory were used in the construction of the piers at Bridlington. The last Prior, William Wode, was executed at Tyburn for his part in the Pilgrimage of Grace. =Restoration= For three centuries after the dissolution, the Nave continued to be used as the parish church and only a third of the building was actually used by the congregation. From 1846 the parish began to raise funds to restore the church and it was partially re-roofed; the west window was opened out and filled with stained glass; the interior was white-washed; and the east window also was filled with stained glass. This work was carried out by the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin, but their work was not to the satisfaction of the church authorities. Around 1874 the church employed Sir George Gilbert Scott to completely refurbish the church as it is today. The total cost of the restoration was about £27,000. =Organ= The organ was built in 1889 by the Belgian organ builder Charles Anneessens. Various adjustments were made in the 20th century, before it was restored and enlarged between 2004 and 2006 by Nicholson. It has been recorded a number of times and is played by Daniel Moult in the film and recording Virtuoso! Music for Organ.

It stars Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr as a married couple whose relationship is shaken by their service in the Second World War. The supporting cast includes Glynis Johns, Ann Todd and Roland Culver. It was produced and directed by Alexander Korda from a screenplay by Clemence Dane and Anthony Pelissier based on a story by Clemence Dane. Dane won the Academy Award for Best Story. The music score was by Clifton Parker and the cinematography by Georges Périnal. Plot Robert and Cathy Wilson are a timid married couple in 1940 London. He is a bookkeeper, she a bored housewife. However, their tedium-filled lives are drastically changed by the war. He enlists in the Royal Navy, while she joins the Wrens. During the three years the couple are apart (their shore leaves never coincide), they are transformed, each becoming much more self-confident. Cathy's assertive new friend, Dizzy Clayton, helps her break out of her shell. She begins going out with Dizzy's cousin, naval architect Richard, who falls in love with her. However, she remains faithful (if unenthusiastically) to her husband. Meanwhile, Robert toughens up on sea duty and in time becomes a petty officer. His hands are badly burned when his ship is sunk, but he stoically rows in the lifeboat for five days without complaint. He recuperates in a hospital, tended by Elena, a beautiful nurse. On the last night of his stay, he asks her out to dinner. He is attracted to her, but she informs him that she lost her beloved husband only six months earlier, kisses him, and leaves. Robert and Cathy both receive ten-day leaves, but each dreads being reunited with the dowdy spouse each remembers and being forced back into the dreary life they shared. Cathy cannot bring herself to return to her flat, where Robert is waiting. Instead, she phones Robert and asks him to talk with her on more neutral ground, blurting out that she wants to leave him. He is furious. They meet on the street, in the pitch dark of the blackout. Robert readily agrees to a divorce, to her surprise, telling her that he was going to ask her for one. They go to the neighbourhood pub to discuss the divorce and for the first time in three years they each get a good look at the transformation in the other. Throughout the film, they have been talking to their new friends about their life together, and now they revisit those issues and talk honestly to each other about the past. They find that if they are \\"perfect strangers\\" now, they did not know each other very well before. For Cathy, the hated view from their flat, all walls and smoking chimneys, is a symbol of their lives before the war. They dance with each other, for the first time, and are clearly attracted. Dizzy and Robert's friend 'Scotty' meet them in the pub. Both are stunned. Dizzy thinks Cathy is crazy. Scotty calls Cathy a pin-up, but the compliment goes wrong when he shares—at some length—Robert's unflattering descriptions of the 'old' Cathy. She is insulted and furious. It hardens her heart and she walks out as the pub closes. Outside, waiting in vain for a taxi in the bombed-out intersection, the argument continues—they even fight over where the shops were located. In the end, Scotty goes to his billet, leaving Robert on the street, thinking (in a voiceover). The girls go to the flat, where Cathy wistfully tells Dizzy about how she and Robert met. Robert returns to retrieve his gear and finds Cathy sitting in the window. The sky is bright with early morning light, and beyond the shattered houses, the vista toward the river and beyond is broken only by a church steeple. The high walls are gone. “Well, you've certainly got the view you always wanted,” Robert says looking straight out the window. “Miles and miles of it,” Cathy replies. “But oh Robert, the desolation.” “Poor old London,” he says. And then after a pause, “Well, we'll just have to build it up again. That's all.” “It will take years and years,” she says. Turning to her, putting his hand on hers, he answers, smiling, “Well, what does that matter? We're young.” They embrace, passionately. Cast *Robert Donat as Robert Wilson *Deborah Kerr as Cathy Wilson *Glynis Johns as Dizzy Clayton *Ann Todd as Elena *Roland Culver as Richard *Elliott Mason as Mrs. Hemmings Cast notes *Deborah Kerr made her MGM debut in this film. MGM had purchased half of her contract after her performance in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, in which she played three roles. MGM studio boss Louis B. Mayer is supposed to have said \\"That girl's a star\\" upon seeing her performance in Perfect Strangers, and she was soon an established MGM property. *This was Robert Donat's last film for MGM. *Roger Moore made his uncredited film debut in Perfect Strangers. Production Perfect Strangers was based on a story by Esther McCracken and a screen treatment by Arthur Wimperis. It was meant to be the first of what was supposed to be a number of co-productions between Alexander Korda and M-G-M made in Britain - other proposed projects included Lottie Dundasd with Vivien Leigh from a story by Edith Bagnold, a biopic of Robert Louis Stevenson starring Robert Donat, a version of War and Peace directed by Orson Welles and starring Korda's wife, Merle Oberon, Velvet Coat by GB Stern and an untitled Carol Reed project. Perfect Strangers was originally meant to star Donat and Oberon but by December 1943 Oberon had been replaced by Deborah Kerr, as Oberton was still in the USA. Wesley Ruggles was to come over from Hollywood to direct.METRO OPENS ITS NEW HOME IN LONDON By C.A. LEJEUNE. New York Times 26 Dec 1943: X4. By March 1944, the film was about to start filming at Denham Studios.

Shooting did not actually begin until May. The delay had come about for several reasons: the script was constantly rewritten to account for changes in the war, Ruggles fell ill with the flu shortly after he arrived in England, and Donat was involved in a play. Then Donat fell ill and Ruggles left the project after an argument with Korda.SPRING FINDS LONDON'S FILM STUDIOS ACTIVE: Shaw Satisfied With 'Caesar' Profile of Claude Rains  Two Coming This Way By C.A.

The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to what would eventually be fatal for many, especially the majority of women. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. And after several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. Billington signed the Mayflower Compact that day.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920), Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document, pp. 7-19.  Life in Plymouth colony  The Billington family appeared a number of times in the accounts of early Plymouth Colony and were reported to be the colony's troublemakers. Francis made squibs and fired a musket in the Mayflower while the ship was anchored off Cape Cod.

He died in Middleboro on December 3, 1684.  Death of John Billington  In September 1630 John Billington was tried by a jury and hanged for the murder of John Newcomen, whom he saw as an enemy.

He became a French citizen in 1969 and taught at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1970–88, where his students included Akiko Ebi, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Artur Pizarro, Géry Moutier, Nicholas Angelich, André Sayasov and Jean-Luc Kandyoti.Piano ma non solo, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Anagramme Ed., 2012, pg. 79; Other students included Francesco Libetta, Antonio Pompa-Baldi, Domenico Piccichè, Ivan Donchev and Jean-Marc Savelli. Ciccolini was a celebrated interpreter and advocate of the piano music of the French composers Camille Saint-Saëns, Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Erik Satie as well as that of less prominent composers such as Déodat de Séverac, Jules Massenet and Alexis de Castillon. Ciccolini was known for his having played the music of the Spanish composers Isaac Albéniz, Enrique Granados, and Manuel de Falla, as well as of Franz Liszt. Soprano Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf said of him \\"I have hardly met a more wonderful partner and a more delightful companion.\\" On 9 December 1999, he celebrated a career in France spanning 50 years with a recital at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris. Death Aldo Ciccolini died on 1 February 2015 at his Paris residence, aged 89. Recordings Ciccolini made more than a hundred recordings for EMI-Pathé Marconi and other record companies, including the complete sonata cycles of Mozart and Beethoven, the complete solo piano work of Debussy and two separate cycles of the complete piano works of Satie. In 2002 Ciccolini was awarded the Diapason d'Or for his recording of the entire solo piano works of Janáček for Abeille Music and of Schumann for Cascavelles. His complete Beethoven sonata cycle was re-published by the Cascavelle label in 2006. He also recorded such unusual repertoire as selections from the Péchés de vieillesse by Rossini and the complete piano music of Massenet.

It consists of three interconnected PCBs, and contains its own processor and memory. The PGC was, at the time of its release, the most advanced graphics card for the IBM XT and aimed for tasks such as CAD. Introduced in 1984, the Professional Graphics Controller offered a maximum resolution of 640×480 with 256 colors at a refresh rate of 60 Hertz—a higher resolution and color depth than CGA and EGA supported. This mode is not BIOS-supported. It was intended for the computer-aided design market and included 320 kB of display RAM and an on-board Intel 8088 microprocessor. The 8088 ran software routines such as \\"Draw Polygon\\" and \\"Fill Area\\" from an on-board 64kB ROM so that the host CPU didn't need to load and run these routines itself. While never widespread in consumer-class personal computers, its US $4,290 list price compared favorably to US$50,000 dedicated CAD workstations of the time (even when the $4,995 price of a PC XT model 87IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER AND IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER XT ENHANCED WITH ANNOUNCEMENT OF MATH CO-PROCESSOR OPTION // Announcement Letter Number 183-082 dated June 7, 1983 [Full PC line price list at bottom of document.] https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi- bin/ssialias?appname=skmwww&htmlfid;=897%2FENUS183-082&infotype;=AN&mhq;=IBM%20Personal%20Computer%20XT%20announcement&mhsrc;=ibmsearch_a&subtype;=CAwas included). It was discontinued in 1987 with the arrival of VGA and 8514. Software support The board was targeted at the CAD market, therefore limited software support is to be expected. The only software known to support the PGC are IBM's Graphical Kernel System, P-CAD 4.5, Canyon State Systems CompuShow and AutoCAD 2.5. Output capabilities PGC supports: *640x480 with 256 colors from a palette of 4096 (4 bits per color component) *Color Graphics Adapter text and graphics modes. Text modes use a font with 8x16-pixel character cells and have 400 rows of pixels. Operation The display adapter was composed of three physical circuit boards (one with the on-board microprocessor, firmware ROMs and video output connector, one providing CGA emulation, and the third mostly carrying RAM) and occupied two adjacent expansion slots on the XT or AT motherboard; the third card was located in between the two slots. The PGC could not be used in the original IBM PC without modification due to the different spacing of its slots. In addition to its native 640 x 480 mode, the PGC optionally supported the documented text and graphics modes of the Color Graphics Adapter, which could be enabled using an onboard jumper. However, it was only partly register-compatible with CGA. Related monitor The PGC's matching display was the IBM 5175, an analog RGB monitor that is unique to it and not compatible with any other video card without modification. With hardware modification, the 5175 can be used with VGA, Macintosh, and various other analog RGB video sources. Some surplus 5175s in VGA-converted form were still sold by catalog retailers such as COMB as late as the early 1990s .

It is grown extensively in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia. Its aromatic dried fruits, like those of its close relative ajwain, are often used in Bengali cuisine but are rarely used in the rest of India. The fresh leaves are used as an herb in Thailand and it is used medicinally in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Characteristics The small dried fruits, commonly referred to as seeds, are similar in appearance to those of ajwain, celery, and caraway. Because of their similarity in both appearance and flavor, it is often confused or substituted with celery seed. Etymology Known as radhuni in Bengali (), is often confused with celery and is known as wild celery in English. It is known as ajmod in Hindi () and Urdu (), both derived from Sanskrit ajamoda () or ajamodika (), from which the name for ajwain is also derived. It is also known as kant-balu in Burmese, and phak chi lom in Thai (), although this name may also refer to a variety of celery.It is also known as අසමෝදගම් (Asamodagam) in Sri Lanka. Uses It is a very strong spice, with a characteristic smell similar to parsley and a taste similar to celery. A couple of pinches can easily overpower a curry. In Bengali cuisine the seeds are used whole, quickly fried in very hot oil until they crackle.It is commonly used in the famous Bengali Dish \\"Shukto\\". They are sometimes part of a local panch phoron (Bengali five spice) mixture replacing black mustard seeds; the other ingredients are cumin seed, fenugreek seed, fennel seed, and Nigella Seed. In other places, a common use is in pickling or spice mixtures.

His real name was Heigo Sakaguchi (坂口 炳五 Sakaguchi Heigo). Biography Born in Niigata, Sakaguchi was one of a group of young Japanese writers to rise to prominence in the years immediately following Japan's defeat in World War II. As such, Ango Sakaguchi was associated with the Buraiha or 'Decadent' School (無頼派 buraiha, the school of irresponsibility and decadence), which designated a group of dissolute writers who expressed their perceived aimlessness and identity crisis of post-World War II Japan. In 1946 he wrote his most famous essay, titled \\"Darakuron\\" (\\"Discourse on Decadence\\"), which examined the role of bushido during the war. It is widely argued that he saw postwar Japan as decadent, yet more truthful than a wartime Japan built on illusions like bushido. (The work itself does not make any claims about the meaning of decadence.) Ango was born in 1906 and was the 12th child of 13. He was born in the middle of a Japan perpetually at war. His father was the president of the Niigata Shimbun newspaper, a politician, and a poet. Ango wanted to be a writer at 16. He moved to Tokyo at 17, after hitting a teacher who caught him truanting. His father died from brain cancer the following year, leaving his family in massive debt. At 20, Ango taught for a year as a substitute teacher following secondary school. He became heavily involved in Buddhism and went to University to study Indian philosophy, graduating at the age of 25. Throughout his career as a student, Ango was very vocal in his opinions. He wrote various works of literature after graduating, receiving praise from writers such as Makino Shin’ichi. His literary career started around the same time as Japan's expansion into Manchuria. At 27, he met and became friends with Yada Tsuneko. His mother died when he was 37, in the middle of World War II. He struggled for recognition as a writer for years before finally finding it with “A Personal View of Japanese Culture” in 1942, and again with “On Decadence” in 1946. In 1947, Ango Sakaguchi wrote an ironical murder mystery, 'Furenzoku satsujin jiken' ('The Non-serial Murder Incident', translated and published in French as 'Meurtres sans série'), for which he received in 1948 the Mystery Writers of Japan Award. Ango had a child at 48 with his wife, Michiyo Kaji. He died from a brain aneurysm at age 48 in 1955, in Kiryū, Gunma.

He was best known for his articles for The Nation in the United States and for The Economist in Britain, serving for decades as a European correspondent for each magazine. Gore Vidal described Singer as \\"one of the best, and certainly the sanest, interpreters of things European for American readers\\", with a \\"Balzacian eye for human detail.\\" Mike Davis labelled Singer \\"the left's most brilliant arsonist\\", with a talent for \\"set[ting] ablaze whole forests of desiccated cliches\\".Amazon.com: Whose Millennium?: Theirs or Ours?: Daniel Singer: Books  Biography  = Early life = Singer was born in 1926 in Warsaw, in his parents' home. His father, Bernard Singer, was to become a well-known journalist, but was impoverished at the time of Daniel's birth. His mother, Esther Singer, was a teacher, and the child of wealthy Jewish parents. Esther, a Marxist, interested both Daniel and a young Isaac Deutscher in left-wing politics, and specifically the ideas of Marx and Rosa Luxemburg. As Daniel aged, his father became more financially successful, and the family was able to move out of the ghetto. Esther quit her job, and Daniel attended a school where he was the only Jew in his class. = Education and escape from Holocaust = In 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Daniel and his sister and mother were staying in southern France. They went to Paris in an attempt to book passage to Warsaw, but could not. Instead, after the occupation of Paris by the Germans, Daniel and his mother and sister left Paris. They went first to Anger, where Daniel went to the Lycée David d'Anger, then to Toulouse (Lyce Lakanal) and after to Marseille (Lycée Thiers). In the beginning of August 1942, the French police came to arrest them; his sister jumped through the window from the second floor, broke her leg and was sent to the hospital; Daniel was away in the countryside with some school friends and learned about his sister coming back home. With the help of the resistance, first Daniel and then his mother and sister escaped to Switzerland. Bernard Singer, meanwhile, was arrested by the Soviet Union, which had occupied eastern Poland under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Bernard was sent to the gulag for two years and released when the USSR entered the war before being allowed to leave for London. During the middle of the Second World War, Daniel studied philosophy in Geneva. In 1944, he and the remainder of his family joined his father in London, where Daniel obtained his bachelor's degree in economics from the University of London. = Journalistic career and marriage = Singer began working for The Economist in 1948, with assistance from his old friend Isaac Deutscher, and for the New Statesman in 1949. His work focused on Poland, France, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union. He remained on staff with The Economist for 19 years. In this period, he also provided radio and television commentary for the BBC and the Canadian CBC. In 1956, Singer married Jeanne Kérel, a French doctoral student in economics in the University of Paris; with a British Council scholarship she spent a year in London in 1952–1953 at the London School of Economics. After their wedding they lived during two years separated. Daniel moved to Paris in May 1958 when he was sent as\\"The Economist correspondent moved to Paris,'. Singer spent the rest of his life living in Paris, reporting first for The Economist, and then, after 1970, for The Nation, and became in 1980 the magazine's European correspondent. He wrote critically of Charles De Gaulle, François Mitterrand, and the French Communist Party, but was enthusiastic about the events of May 1968. = Death = Singer died in 2000 of lung cancer. He requested that the announcement of his death be accompanied by a quotation from Rosa Luxemburg, still his political idol, shortly before her execution: > Your order is built on sand. Tomorrow, the revolution will raise its head > again, Proclaiming to your horror amidst a blaze of trumpets, \\"I was, I am, > I always shall be.\\" The Daniel Singer Millennium Prize Foundation was established in Singer's name after his death. It offers an annual $2,500 prize for an essay in Singer's spirit.The Daniel Singer Millennium Prize Foundation  Political views  Singer's writing was always deeply influenced by his interest in politics, and specifically the process of political change. Throughout his adult life, Singer was a socialist, but a critic of the Soviet Union. Influenced by anarchism, Trotskyism, and various newer dissident schools of Marxism, he was devoted ultimately to the political ideas of Marx and Luxemburg. Singer opposed capitalism, saying that he \\"could not resign himself to the idea that with the technological genius at our disposal we are unable to build a different world.\\" He denied, however, that capitalism's doom is inevitable, writing \\"capitalism has within it the seeds of its own destruction, but only seeds... Capitalism will have to be pushed off the stage.\\" Singer believed that this push \\"will require a revolution.\\" While Singer was an opponent of Stalinism, and believed the French Communist Party in large part responsible for De Gaulle's success in taking power in 1958 and his failure to be overthrown in 1968, he had a nuanced view on the question. He wrote that, \\"while the totalitarian nature of Stalin's Russia is undeniable, I find the thesis of \\"totalitarian twins\\" both wrong and unproductive, and recognised the deep working-class implantation of the CP.Exploiting a Tragedy, or Le Rouge en Noir Singer retained an optimism about the prospects for socialism, writing shortly before his death: > There is no certainty about the future. Humanity has the capability of > destroying itself, and it may very well do so. The hope is with the younger > generation. They will not be able to run away from the problems of the world > the way our generation did and the next generation has. But our > grandchildren will have to deal with the contradictions.  Books  = Prelude to Revolution (1970) = Prelude to Revolution: France in May 1968, first published by Hill and Wang in 1970, is an account of the student uprising and general strike that shook France and imperiled the Gaullist regime in the spring of 1968. Singer argues that the events of May '68, while not a revolution, even a failed one, had the potential to overturn a contradictory French society. However, he claims, they achieved no radical change because the genuine radicals on the non-Communist left had insufficient organisation and influence, while the supposedly radical Communist Party, with sufficient strength to force fundamental change in the crisis, was not actually interested in doing so. According to Percy Brazil, this is the work which established Singer as \\"a major political writer.\\" The New Republic wrote of Prelude to Revolution that \\"if Marx had been living in Paris during May 1968, he might have written this book.\\" = The Road to Gdansk (1981) = The Road to Gdansk, published by Monthly Review Press in 1981, is a collection of essays on Poland, the Soviet Union, and Solidarity. It was described by Foreign Affairs as \\"a sharp and stimulating analysis\\", though a review in Russian Review, while praising its discussion of the USSR, notes that \\"less than a third\\" of the book is devoted to \\"a rather superficial analysis\\" of events in Poland. = Is Socialism Doomed? (1988) = Is Socialism Doomed? The Meaning of Mitterrand was published by Oxford University Press in 1988. The book dissects the phenomenon of François Mitterrand, who came into office as the first socialist president in French history with \\"the most radical program of any offered in the West by a prospective government in at least thirty years\\", but by the end of the 1980s had abandoned radicalism and turned the French Socialist Party back into a standard European social democratic party. Singer argued that the disappointment of Mitterrand for socialists demonstrated not that socialism is a futile project, but that Mitterrand had not really attempted it. = Whose Millennium? (1999) = Whose Millennium? Theirs or Ours? was published by Monthly Review Press in 1999. This book, described by Percy Brazil as Singer's \\"magnum opus\\", challenges the idea that \\"there is no alternative\\" to capitalism.

It is a successor to Lamborghini American Challenge. In 1998, an improved version subtitled was released in Japan only. This version was distributed by Taito, presented as a successor to the company's Speed Race series from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Improvements include a new difficulty level, the ability to freely customize controls, the introduction of weather, and actual pictures of various models of Lamborghini with their names displayed before the demo screen. Gameplay A screenshot of Automobili Lamborghini gameplay on Nintendo 64. Automobili Lamborghini is an arcade-style racing game similar to the Ridge Racer or the early Need for Speed series. There are 4 modes of play: Arcade, Championship, Single Race, and Time Trials. Arcade and Championship consist of a series of races and the ability to unlock various cars; Single Race is a practice mode in normal racing conditions, and Time Trials is a single player race against the player's best times. To challenge these modes, the game features eight vehicles resembling real supercars: the two default cars, representing the Lamborghini Diablo and the Lamborghini Countach; and six unlockable cars won by beating the six configurations of championships, representing the Porsche 959, the Ferrari F50, the Ferrari Testarossa, the Dodge Viper, the McLaren F1, and the Bugatti EB110. Reception Reviews for Automobili Lamborghini ranged from mixed to positive. Critics overwhelmingly lauded its graphics and high frame rate even in four-player, split-screen races. Next Generation called it \\"one of the more beautiful racers in what is hands-down the most filled-out genre for the system\\" and GameSpot commented that \\"The roads and scenery are beautifully rendered and blur by so fast. It's quite an assault to your equilibrium. The illusion of g-forces is undeniable, as is the sensation of just soaring over the track.\\" The controls were a far more divisive issue. Though Next Generation, GameSpot, and Electronic Gaming Monthly all praised the handling as realistic, tight, and easy to learn, GamePro, IGNs Peer Schneider, and The Electric Playground's Victor Lucas contended that the controls are overly touchy and difficult to master. Some also criticized the lack of an option to change the control configuration and the lack of visible damage from collisions. Critics highly praised the game's multiplayer mode, especially the then-rare ability to have human and A.I. opponents at the same time. John Ricciardi of Electronic Gaming Monthly said this feature made Automobili Lamborghini his \\"favorite N64 racer so far\\". By contrast, Lucas criticized the \\"relatively paper thin gameplay\\", bland colors, and \\"intolerably stupid\\" computer opponent. He said that the game should have included more cars and tracks, and criticized the sound effects: \\"These are sports cars of magnitude. The hums, whines and purrs of these particular 'mobiles should not be taken lightly. However, there are times when it sounds like this is a race of turbo-charged hand blenders.\\" GamePro complained at the lack of a reverse gear but found the ability to use both the Rumble Pak and Controller Pak innovative. The reviewer concluded the game to be flawed and lacking in originality, and recommended players instead get San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing. Though praising almost every aspect of the game, Next Generation concluded that \\"It really needs a better sense of speed and more tension, or at least some unique element besides its dream-car license to set it apart. AL64 makes a decent rental, but even at Nintendo's recently lowered prices, it's no steal.\\" However, a majority of reviewers praised the game's sense of speed. Schneider assessed that \\"although there are a few obvious faults in the game, this sequel to the Euro-hit Lamborghini American Challenge for the Super NES does a decent job at bringing street racing home.\\" References External links * Category:1997 video games Category:Lamborghini video games Category:Nintendo 64-only games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Racing video games Category:Titus Software games Category:Video games developed in France Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Automobili Lamborghini"},{"id":"1969649","text":"Laura Flessel-Colovic (born 6 November 1971) is a French politician and épée fencer who served as Minister of Sports from 2017 to 2018. Born in Pointe-à- Pitre, Guadeloupe, she has won the most Olympic medals of any French sportswoman, with five. Before 2007, she was a member of the Levallois Sporting Club Escrime, and now works with Lagardère Paris Racing. She is married and has one daughter. She was France's flag-bearer at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London, which was her fifth and last Olympics. She was appointed Minister of Sports in the Philippe Government on 17 May 2017 and resigned on 4 September 2018. Sporting career Laura Flessel at 2007 European Fencing Championships =Fencer= Laura Flessel began fencing at age six and quickly became a very talented fencer. She progressed quickly and became champion of Guadeloupe. Then, she gained solid experience on the Caribbean, Central American and Pan American circuits, winning in 1990 the Pan American Championships in foil and épée. The same year, she joined the metropolis, to train with the Racing Club de France. She also trains within the INSEP, which allows her to face the best French fencers. She won her first world stage success in 1995, finishing in third place at the Hague World Championships. This bronze medal is accompanied by a silver medal in the team event, which was defeated 45 to 44 by Hungary. Her teammates were Valérie Barlois, Sophie Moressee and Sangita Tripathi. After her gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics and her victory at 1998 World Cup, she became the eighth French fencer, and first woman, to win the Olympic and World Champion titles. She is one of the favorites for the 2000 Summer Olympics title. She finally fails in the semi-final against Timea Nagy. At the 2006 World Championships in Turin, she gets a new individual bronze medal, beaten again by Timea Nagy The 2008 Summer Olympics, her fourth Olympic Games, marks a turning point as it is the first Olympics where she does not get a medal after being eliminated by Li Na (15-9) in the quarter-finals. The year 2009 sees again Laura Flessel at the top but still without success with a third place at the European Championships in Plovdiv and a failure at the World Championships in Antalya where she lost f in quarter final against Lyubov Shutova after a close match that ends in sudden death on the score of 7 to 8. On 21 April 2012, she qualifies for the individual event of the London Olympics by defeating Emma Samuelsson in the semifinals of the European Zone Qualifying Championship in Bratislava. On 14 May 2012, Laura Flessel is officially designated flag bearer of the French delegation for the London Olympics. In her final competition, she defeated Courtney Hurley (15-12) before losing to Simona Gherman (No. 4 worldwide) 15-13. She ends her career at the age of 40. =Controversy= Laura Flessel was banned for three months in 2002 after failing a doping test. She tested positive for the banned substance coramine glucose, blaming the French team doctors for giving her a drug that is available over the counter in France. =Sports management= In 2012, she took over the management of Nathalie Moellhausen, a native of Italy and competing under the colors of Brazil, forming a group also composed of two fencing masters, Daniel Levavasseur and Michel Sicard, the latter having both coached Flessel. Sports consultant and other activities =Media and television= Laura Flessel in 2012 In 2008, Laura Flessel was a columnist for the daily newspaper Aujourd'hui Sport. She was a contestant on the third season of Danse avec les stars. During the 2016 Summer Olympics she commented, on Canal +, the opening ceremony with Stéphane Guy and Joris Sabi, the fencing events with Frédéric Roullier and the closing ceremony with Julien Fébreau and Jean Galfione. =Community life= She is ambassador of the AMREF Flying Doctors' Stand Up for African Mothers campaign, the godmother of Handicap International, and Ambassador of Plan France. His long-term project is to bring fencing to disadvantaged cities and places. She is also a goodwill ambassador for UNESCO where she promotes tolerance in sports. She founded the association Ti'Colibri which aims to promote fencing. Thanks to its action, it has been able to offer means and equipment to clubs with few resources. Political career During the two-rounds of the French presidential election of 2017, she was one of the sixty active or retired sportsmen who signed a call to vote for Emmanuel Macron on 7 May 2017 in the second round of the presidential election \\"so that sport remains an area of freedom, equality and fraternity.\\" On 17 May 2017, she was appointed Minister of Sports in the First Philippe government, under the presidency of Emmanuel Macron, a position she held in the Second Philippe government, which was formed on 21 June 2017. The government's second most popular minister at the end of 2017, she is notably responsible for preparing the organization of the 2024 Summer Olympics. At the beginning of 2018, she launched a campaign against discrimination in the sporting world, with as ambassadors Antoine Griezmann, Estelle Mossely, Marie-Amélie Le Fur, Frédéric Michalak, Emmeline Ndongue and Florent Manaudou.

Their range is known to extend to James Bay to the north, and southeastern Manitoba to the west. Description Blue-spotted salamanders are between in length, of which the tail comprises 40%. Their skin is bluish-black, with characteristic blue and white flecks on its back, and bluish-white spots on the sides of its body and tail. They have an elongated body. The vent is typically black, which contrasts with the paler belly. Larvae that have transformed may have yellow splotches; these turn blue once the individual becomes terrestrial. Occasionally, a melanistic individual may be found in the wild. They have long toes: four on the front feet and five on the hind feet. Typically, specimens will have 12–14 costal grooves. Males tend to be smaller than females, though they have longer, flattened tails. Habitat Blue-spotted salamanders are primarily found in moist, deciduous hardwood forests and swampy woodlands, though they can be found in coniferous forests and fields too. They prefer vernal pools that retain water into mid- summer, to ensure access to a suitable breeding habitat. Underbrush, leaf litter, rocks and logs are commonly used for shelter. Studies are beginning to show that habitat selection may also be affected by factors such as light pollution and chemical hues. Reproduction Eggs are laid in small agglomerations attached to twigs, rocks or plants at the edge of a woodland pond or ditch. Clutches average a dozen eggs, and females may lay up to 500 eggs yearly. Males and females first mate when two years old. Breeding occurs in early spring near vernal pools. Eggs take about one month to hatch. At hatching, larvae have a well-developed mouth and eyes. Front limbs form at two weeks, and hind limbs form at three weeks. It will fully transform to its terrestrial state by late summer. Blue-spotted salamanders are known to be associated with unisexual (all-female) populations of ancient origin. The unisexual females often look like blue-spotted salamanders but have hybrid genomes and require sperm from a co-occurring, related species to fertilize their eggs and initiate development. Usually the eggs then discard the sperm genome and develop asexually (i.e., gynogenesis, with premeiotic doubling); however, they may incorporate the genome from the sperm into the resulting offspring. Sperm incorporation commonly takes the form of genome addition (resulting in ploidy elevation in the offspring), or genome replacement, wherein one of the maternal genomes is discarded. This unique mode of reproduction has been termed kleptogenesis by Bogart and his colleagues. =Relationship with Tremblay's salamander = Female Tremblay's salamanders (Ambystoma tremblayi) breed with male blue-spotted salamanders from March to April. Eggs are laid singly or in small masses of 6 to 10 eggs on debris at pond bottom. The males' chromosome contribution only stimulates the egg's development; its genetic material is ignored.

In a series of events that took place over 32 days, the U.S. Air Force's Military Airlift Command shipped 22,325 tons of tanks, artillery, ammunition, and supplies in C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft between 14 October and 14 November 1973. The U.S. support helped ensure that Israel survived a coordinated and surprise attack from the Soviet-backed Arab Republic of Egypt and Syrian Arab Republic. Following a U.S. pledge of support on 19 October, the oil-exporting Arab states within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held to their previously declared warnings to use oil as a \\"weapon\\" and declared a complete oil embargo on the United States, and restrictions on other countries. This, along with the contemporaneous failure of major pricing and production negotiations between the exporters and the major oil companies, led to the 1973 oil crisis. Policy makers in Washington learned lessons that decisively shaped subsequent American political and strategic policies especially regarding the Middle East. In addition the operation totally transformed US–Saudi relations.Arnon Gutfeld and Clinton R. Zumbrunnen, \\"From Nickel Grass to Desert Storm: The Transformation of US Intervention Capabilities in the Middle East.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 49.4 (2013): 623-644. Background Israel, as well as the US and most of the world, were caught by surprise on 6 October 1973 when Egypt and Syria crossed their borders and attacked Israel from the Sinai and the Golan Heights, respectively. In an attempt to undermine the United States ally, the Arab states were trained, prepared and supplied by Moscow. The Soviet Union had supplied Egypt and Syria over 600 advanced surface-to-air missiles, 300 MiG-21 fighters, 1,200 tanks, and hundreds of thousands of tons of war material. Seeing Israel's vulnerable position, Henry Kissinger, the United States Secretary of State and President Richard Nixon's National Security Adviser, made arrangements for El Al to pick up some items, including ammunition, \\"high technology products\\" and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles at a US naval base in Virginia. A modest effort soon began, but Kissinger still hoped to keep any visible involvement at a minimum. On 8 October, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton nuclear warheads on Jericho missiles and F-4s, which were prepared for action against Syrian and Egyptian targets; their preparation was made easily detectable, likely as a signal to the United States. Kissinger learned of this threatening nuclear escalation on the morning of 9 October. On that same day, Meir issued a personal appeal for military assistance, which European nations declined. U.S. President Richard Nixon, however, ordered the commencement of Operation Nickel Grass, to replace all of Israel's materiel losses. The decision was taken the same day the Soviets began their own resupply operation of Arab forces by sea. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Kissinger had told Anwar Sadat that the reason for the U.S. airlift was that the Israelis were close to \\"going nuclear.\\" However, subsequent interviews with Kissinger, James Schlesinger, and William Quandt suggested that the nuclear aspect was not a major factor in the decision to re-supply. These officials cited the ongoing Soviet re-supply effort and Sadat's early rejection of a ceasefire as the primary motivators. Operation Initially, only the Israeli national airline, El Al, provided transport, and supplies began to arrive in Israel on 10 October, the same day the first Soviet resupply by air arrived in Damascus. Nonetheless, it was soon clear that El Al's limited supply of ill-configured passenger aircraft were insufficient. Still wanting to avoid direct US involvement, starting 10 October, the use of commercial carriers was explored to provide 10–20 flights a day. None of these were willing to accept the job for fear of being refused entry to Arab nations after the war. On 12 October, Nixon decided that no more delays could be allowed, and ordered the air force to \\"send everything that can fly.\\" Within nine hours, C-141s and C-5s were en route to Israel. The political maneuvering was not immediately solved by the air force's participation however: traditional European allies refused to allow re-supply aircraft to land for refueling or even overfly their territory. Portugal seemed willing to help though, so aircraft were dispatched to Lajes Field in the Azores Islands. After a few hours in the air, word came through that Portugal would permit them to land, and Lajes became a key staging point for the rest of the airlift. Strategic Air Command (SAC) KC-135As were the first to arrive at Lajes Air Base. The Stratotankers had left Pease AFB, New Hampshire, the night of Saturday, 13 October (one of the bases El Al was using to re-supply the war effort); the tankers were ferrying factory-fresh Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II aircraft flying non-stop from the factory in St. Louis, Missouri to Ben Gurion Airport. To comply with the demands of other European nations, even U.S. supplies already stationed in Europe were routed through Lajes, and soon over thirty aircraft per day were moving through Lajes. To accommodate this, the base grew to house an extra 1,300 people who were billeted in improvised housing and hastily reactivated World War II barracks, rooms that would normally accommodate one or two enlisted men were expanded to four (2 bunk- beds). Between Portugal and Israel, the aircraft had to follow an extremely precise route. Flying exactly along the airspace border between hostile Arab nations to the south and European nations to the north, the transport craft flew down the middle of the Mediterranean Sea to Israel. Fighter escort was deemed necessary for this leg of the journey, so American fighters from the U.S. 6th Fleet escorted the transports to within of Israel, where Israeli Air Force Phantoms and Mirages escorted them into Ben Gurion Airport. Along the Mediterranean route, American ships were stationed every , and an aircraft carrier every . These precautions appeared justified when unidentified Arab fighters made threats over the radio, but no conflict ensued. Upon arrival, the transports were unloaded by U.S. and Israeli servicemen before they returned home and supplies were expedited to the front where they arrived within a few hours. The first C-5A Galaxy transport airplane arrived at Lod airport at 18:30 local time on 14 October. That same day the Battle of the Sinai had concluded in Israel's favor. A major Egyptian thrust had been stopped with the destruction of many attacking tanks, and Israel was now winning the war. An A-4E landing on in October 1973. Airlifted supplies were not all that was delivered under Nickel Grass. In the opening days of the war, Arab forces destroyed significant numbers of Israeli Air Force aircraft, surprising the Israelis with aggressive use of the new Soviet SA-6 Gainful surface-to-air missile. Consequently, at least 100 F-4 Phantom II fighters were sent to Israel under Nickel Grass, coming from the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, the 33d Tactical Fighter Wing and the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing. They were flown to Lod, where American pilots were swapped for their Israeli counterparts. After the replacement of USAF insignia with IAF insignia if needed, the planes were refueled and ordered to the front, often taking to the air within hours of having arrived. Some aircraft came directly from the USAFE fleet and operated in USAF camouflage, but with Israeli insignia, thus earning the Israeli nickname \\"Frog\\". Nine days after the initial attack, Israel launched counterattacks. Thirty-six A-4 Skyhawks from U.S. stocks, staging from Lajes were refueled by SAC KC-135A tankers from Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire and U.S. Navy tankers from the west of the Strait of Gibraltar. They then flew on to the southeast of Sicily where they stayed overnight, then continued on to Israel refueling once more from tankers launched from the south of Crete. Twelve C-130E Hercules transports were also transferred to Israel, the first of the type to be delivered to the IDF/AF. When the third cease-fire resolution was finally implemented on October 24, the airlift immediately slowed. Further flights were made to rebuild Israeli forces to their pre-war strength, and Operation Nickel Grass was ended on 14 November. In the end, the military airlift shipped 22,325 tons of materiel to Israel. Additionally, the United States conducted its own seaborne re-supply operation, delivering 33,210 tons to Israel by 30 October. el-Shazly states: \\"...the USA mounted a seaborne resupply operation of 33,210 tons by October 30\\" and \\"...the Soviet Union mounted a sea-borne resupply operation: no less than 63,000 tons, mainly to Syria, by October 30.\\" During the same general time, the Soviets airlifted 12,500–15,000 tons of supplies, more than half of which went to Syria; they also supplied another 63,000 tons mainly to Syria by means of a sealift.  Effects  Operation Nickel Grass had immediate and far-reaching effects. Arab members of OPEC had declared they would limit or stop oil shipments to the United States and other countries if they supported Israel in the conflict. Holding to their threats, the Arab states declared a complete oil embargo on the United States. Oil prices skyrocketed, fuel became scarce, and the United States was soon embroiled in the 1973 oil crisis. Nickel Grass also revealed a severe deficiency in American airlift capabilities: the need for staging bases overseas. Without Portugal's assistance, the airlift might not even have been possible. As a result, the U.S. greatly expanded its aerial refueling capabilities and made long-distance flight operations the standard rather than the exception. A GAO study of the operation discussed the shortcomings of the C-141A. As a result, the C-141B was conceived. The A models were sent back to Georgia where they were cut fore and aft of the wing, extended in length by three pallet positions, and refitted for in-flight refueling. Nickel Grass vindicated the Air Force decision to purchase the C-5 Galaxy. Since its introduction in 1970, the C-5 had been plagued by problems. The Air Force claimed to have rectified the problems, but the C-5 was still viewed by the press as an expensive failure. During Nickel Grass, C-5s carried 48% of the total cargo in only 145 of the 567 total missions. The C-5 also carried \\"outsize\\" cargo such as M60 Patton tanks, M109 howitzers, ground radar systems, mobile tractor units, CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters, and A-4 Skyhawk components, cargo that could not fit in smaller aircraft. This performance justified the C-5's existence. Another effect of the operation was the near-resignation of then United States chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) General George Brown. Brown was nearly forced to resign after making comments claiming that Israel received U.S. military aid because Jews controlled the American banking system.

It thus offers worse frequency behavior, showing artifacts (pixelation) at the early stages, in return for simpler implementation. = Iteration = Adam7 arises from iteration of the following pattern: { style=\\"background: transparent;\\" -  12 33 } which may be interpreted as \\"folding\\" in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Similarly, GIF interlacing can be seen as iteration of the pattern, but only in the vertical direction ( expands to which is filled in as ). Using this 3-pass pattern means the first pass is (1/2)2 = 1/4 (25%) of the image. Iterating this pattern once yields a 5-pass scheme; after 3 passes this yields { style=\\"background: transparent;\\" -  1 . 2 . . . . . 3 . 3 . . . . . } which is then filled in to: { style=\\"background: transparent;\\" -  1 4 2 4 5 5 5 5 3 4 3 4 5 5 5 5 } In the 5-pass pattern, the first pass (1/4)2 = 1/16 (6.25%) of the image. Iterating again yields the 7-pass Adam7 scheme, where the first pass (1/8)2 = 1/64 (1.5625%) of the image. In principle this can be iterated, yielding a 9-pass scheme, an 11-pass scheme, and so forth, or alternatively an adaptive number of passes can be used, as many as the image size will allow (so the first pass consists of a single pixel), as is usual in scale-free multiscale modeling. In the context that PNG was developed (i.e., for the image sizes and connection speeds in question), a 7-pass scheme was seen as sufficient, and preferable to a simple 5-pass scheme.

Invented near the beginning of the 20th century, it was originally and still is used for making cucumber sandwiches, but in recent years it has been used as a dip or combined with meat in a sandwich. This spread can be obtained pre-made from some Louisville area grocery stores. Although benedictine is rarely seen in restaurants outside the state of Kentucky, it has been written about in articles in national publications such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Saveur Magazine, and also reported about on multimedia outlets such as the Food Network and NPR. A benedictine-based sandwich was featured on the Food Network's 50 States 50 Sandwiches program in 2012, on the television shows of celebrity chefs Paula Deen and Damaris Phillips, in Southern Living magazine as one of June's \\"2011 Best Recipes\\" for their corresponding issue, in Garden & Gun magazine, and in PopSugar. History Benedictine was invented near the beginning of the 20th century by Jennie Carter Benedict, a caterer, restaurateur and cookbook author in Louisville, Kentucky. Benedict opened a kitchen for providing catering services in 1893, and in 1900 opened a restaurant and tea room called Benedict's. It was probably during her catering period when she invented and originally served benedictine. Benedict's cook books are still being sold a century after they were first published. For example, her The Blue Ribbon Cook Book, which first published in 1902, has been reprinted numerous times and most recently in 2008. Although early editions of this book do not contain a recipe for the spread, the most recent edition does. Recipe Following are the original benedictine recipe ingredients used by Benedict, as reported by the Louisville Courier-Journal and NPR: *8 oz. cream cheese, softened *3 tbsps. cucumber juice *1 tbsp. onion juice *1 tsp. salt *A few grains of cayenne pepper *2 drops green food coloring The original spread is made by thoroughly blending all these ingredients with a fork. Modern variants of the recipe use grated or chopped cucumber and onions rather than juice, as well as dill and common spread ingredients. They also use significantly less salt.

Several are potentially toxic, most notably the poisons commonly found in the plant species Solanum dulcamara (bittersweet nightshade) and other plants in the genus Solanum, including potato. A prototypical glycoalkaloid is solanine (composed of the sugar solanose and the alkaloid solanidine), which is found in potato. The alkaloidal portion of the glycoalkaloid is also generically referred to as an aglycone. The intact glycoalkaloid is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but causes gastrointestinal irritation. The aglycone is absorbed and is believed to be responsible for observed nervous system signs. Glycoalkaloids are typically bitter tasting, and produce a burning irritation in the back of the mouth and side of the tongue. The Aymara people of Bolivia use taste to detect the levels of glycoalkaloids in potatoes to determine the safety of various cultigens.

McDonough is founding principal of William McDonough + Partners, co-founder of McDonough MBDC as well as co-author of Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things and The Upcycle: Beyond Sustainability—Designing for Abundance. McDonough's career is focused on creating a beneficial footprint. He espouses a message that we can design materials, systems, companies, products, buildings, and communities that continuously improve over time. Biography McDonough was born in Tokyo, the son of an American Seagram's executive, and trained at Dartmouth College and Yale University. In 1981 McDonough founded his architectural practice, and his first major commission was the 1984 Environmental Defense Fund Headquarters. The EDF's requirement of good indoor air quality in the structure exposed McDonough to the need for sustainable development. McDonough's architecture practice, William McDonough + Partners, operates in Charlottesville, Virginia. McDonough moved his practice from New York City to Charlottesville in 1994 when he was appointed as the Dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Virginia. He served as Dean until 1999 and has since served as a professor of business administration and an alumni research professor. He is chief executive of McDonough Innovation, which provides high-level consulting to global companies, organizations and governments and co-founded the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. He is also co-founder of MBDC, based in Charlottesville, Virginia. A number of large corporate projects for The Gap, Nike, and Herman Miller, led to his commission for a 20-year, US$2 billion environmental re-engineering of the Ford Motor Company's legendary River Rouge Plant in Dearborn, Michigan. The project included rolling out the world's largest \\"living roof\\" in October 2002. The roof of the 1.1 million square foot (100,000 m²) Dearborn truck assembly plant was covered with more than 10 acres (40,000 m²) of sedum, a low-growing ground cover. In 1996 McDonough became the first and only individual recipient of the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development. In 1999 Time called him \\"Hero for the Planet\\". In 2002 he co-authored Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. In 2004 he received a National Design Award for environmental design from the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. He is also a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council.Design Futures Council Senior Fellows McDonough was also a senior advisor and Venture Partner at VantagePoint Capital Partners, one of the largest venture capital investors in clean technology. Design philosophy William McDonough and his architecture and urban design firm, William McDonough + Partners, ground their work in Cradle to Cradle Design, a philosophy developed in the 2002 book, Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. The goal is to frame design as \\"a beneficial, regenerative force—one that seeks to create ecological footprints to delight in, not lament.\\" The primary goal of Cradle to Cradle Design is to shift thinking from doing \\"less bad\\" to being \\"more good.\\" McDonough has also articulated the Cradle to Cradle Design framework as The Five Goods™ (Good Materials, Good Economy, Good Energy, Good Water, Good Lives) to help companies focus and evaluate their efforts on becoming \\"more good.\\" The Five Goods were also designed to offer a streamlined method of addressing each of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. William McDonough + Partner's designed this office building at 901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, California. Completed in 1997, it is now home to YouTube. The design of the firm is often categorized as green architecture or sustainable architecture. The concept, closely linked with green building, is not known for a distinctive visual style, but for minimizing the negative environmental impact of a building. McDonough, however, is often quoted as saying the aspiration is to design something like a tree, something that creates good, like oxygen, rather than minimizing negative impact. McDonough's designs use solar and other passive energy efficiency techniques, as illustrated by the William McDonough + Partners' Flow House designed for the Make It Right Foundation New Orleans. The design incorporates deep overhangs, multiple connections with exterior areas allowing for much daylight and natural ventilation, roof mounted PV panels, water cisterns to harvest rainwater runoff and rain gardens to absorb any storm runoff. In 1984, McDonough and his colleagues designed the Environmental Defense Fund office in New York City. Since then, William McDonough + Partners has been responsible for other milestones in the movement, such as 901 Cherry Ave in San Bruno, California, completed in 1997 for Gap, Inc.; it is now home to Google's YouTube. The building features a green roof that helps to prevent water runoff, insulates the building from noise and provides a habitat for several species, and received the BusinessWeek/Architectural Record Design Award in 1998. The Bernheim Arboretum Visitor Center for the Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, in Clermont, Kentucky, completed in 2005, blurs the line between outdoor and indoor space. This project, like others designed by William McDonough + Partners, draws heavily on the biophilia hypothesis - the study of the human desire and physiological need for contact with nature. The building was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum rating. Together with his architecture firm, McDonough developed a master plan for the design of Park 2020, the first large-scale urban development in the Netherlands that adopts the Cradle to Cradle philosophy. William McDonough co-founded the Make It Right Foundation New Orleans with Brad Pitt. This is an effort to rebuild the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans. Dedicated in 2012, the NASA Ames Research Center's Sustainability Base is designed to harvest more energy than it needs to operate and to cleanse its own water. It was designed to meet a conventional budget and tight timeline, be a test bed for NASA technologies, and it exceeds LEED Platinum metrics. The facility is designed to \\"learn\\"—and continuously improve—over time. McDonough addressed the Arctic Circle China Forum in Shanghai and laid out a framework for how to \\"bring back breathing cities\\" in May 2019. This system seeks to avoid focusing on releasing less carbon and fewer toxic chemicals into the air and instead shifts to integrating renewable energy such as geothermal as a transformative solution to air pollution and climate change. This vision encourages cities to break out of the urban linear flow of, “take, make, waste,” and embrace a circular flow of \\"take, make, retake, remake, restore\\" to implement a Circular Carbon Economy. In June 2019 William McDonough delivered a keynote address at Sustainable Brands on \\"A Bold New Vision for the Collection, Processing, Circularity and Productivity of Plastic Waste\\". As a step toward solving the plastics crisis, McDonough directed the audience to \\"refuse refuse\\", or reject plastics which are not reusable, recyclable, compostable and recoverable. Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Products Program On May 20, 2010 at Google Corporate Headquarters, the Googleplex, McDonough announced the launch of the Green Products Innovation Institute, which was later renamed the \\"Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute.\\" The Institute builds on the 2008 California state law that establishes the nation's first green chemistry program. The non-profit public/private Institute has received the Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Products Program on an exclusive, worldwide basis to accelerate the transition to safe material use and increased material reutilization. Executives from Google, Walmart, YouTube, Shaw Inc. and Herman Miller Inc. joined McDonough for the announcement. The Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Products Program is based on five attributes, Material Health, Circular Economy, Renewable Energy, Water Stewardship and Social Fairness. On June 18, 2019, McDonough delivered a plenary at GreenBiz's inaugural Circularity '19 conference, where he spoke about the program encouraging a safe then circular economy to prevent recirculating harmful chemicals, which he refers to as retox. World Economic Forum At the January 2014 World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting held in Davos, Switzerland, William McDonough led the first CEO workshop that was centered around sustainable design, with an added focus on Cradle and Cradle, The Upcycle, and the circular economy. Prior to the 2014 meeting, McDonough participated in the organizing process in Geneva, when the WEF partnered with the United Nations to review the issue of climate change. It was later determined that climate change and the circular economy would be the main focus of the 2014 WEF meeting. McDonough was appointed as Chair of the Forum's Meta-Council on Circular Economy in July 2014. Reception In May 2008, Vanity Fair magazine offered an extensive profile of McDonough, which included a close look at several of his clients and projects, in the piece \\"Industrial Revolution, Take Two.\\" Similar profiles about McDonough and his work have been published by the San Francisco Chronicle, Discover Magazine, and Time Magazine. In 2013, Stanford University Libraries began the William McDonough “Living Archive\\". Stanford University Libraries will also host the William A. McDonough Archive (WAMA). This will be a first of a kind real-time \\"Living Archive\\". He was recognized at the 2017 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland as the recipient of the Fortune Award for Circular Economy Leadership for outstanding contribution to the development of a prosperous and sustainable economy. McDonough was named as one of Fortune Magazine's World's 50 Greatest Leaders in 2019 at number 24 in recognition of his contributions to the green building movement, being a leading proponent of the circular economy and his efforts to redesign plastics.

A retainer of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he fought in the battle of Shizugatake in 1583, and soon became known as one of Seven Spears of Shizugatake which also included Katō Kiyomasa and others. Biography Ama, Aichi Prefecture） Ukiyo-e of Fukushima Masanori Fukushima Masanori, or as he was first known, Ichimatsu, was born in Owari Province, the son of Fukushima Masanobu. He is believed to have been the cousin of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He first engaged in battle at the assault on Miki Castle in Harima Province, and following the battle of Yamazaki, he was granted a 500 koku stipend. At the battle of Shizugatake in 1583, he defeated Haigo Gozaemon, a prominent samurai. Masanori (Tenshō 11) had the honor of taking the first head, namely that of the enemy general Ogasato Ieyoshi, receiving a 5000 koku increase in his stipend for this distinction (the other six \\"Spears\\" each received 3000 Koku), he married with Omasa. Masanori took part in many of Hideyoshi's campaigns; it was after the Kyūshū Expedition, however, that he was made a daimyō. Receiving the fief of Imabari in Iyo Province, his income was rated at 110,000 koku. Soon after, he took part in the Korean Campaign. Masanori was to once again receive distinction when he took Ch'ongju.Turnbull, Stephen. Samurai Invasion. London: Cassell & Co., p. 120. Following his involvement in the Korean campaign, Masanori was involved in the pursuit of Toyotomi Hidetsugu. He led 10,000 men in 1595, surrounded Seiganji temple on Mount Kōya, and waited until Hidetsugu had committed suicide.Turnbull, Stephen. Samurai Invasion. London: Cassell & Co., p. 232. With Hidetsugu dead, Masanori received a 90,000 koku increase in stipend, and received Hidetsugu's former fief of Kiyosu, in Owari Province as well.Berry, Mary Elizabeth. Hideyoshi. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp. 127–128. Masanori sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara, and thus ensured the survival of his domain. Although he later lost his holdings, his descendants became hatamoto in the service of the Tokugawa shōgun. In popular culture Fukushima Masanori is featured in Koei's video games Kessen, Kessen III, Samurai Warriors, and as a non-playable character in Samurai Warriors 3. He is a playable character in the third installment's expansions, Samurai Warriors 3 Z and Samurai Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends, and in the fourth installment, Samurai Warriors 4 and its subsequent expansions. He is a playable character in Pokémon Conquest (Pokémon + Nobunaga's Ambition in Japan), with his partner Pokémon being Krokorok and Krookodile.

Her productions include 1975's Picnic at Hanging Rock, and Gallipoli, which received an AFI Award in 1982 as Best Film. Early life and career Lovell says she was born in either Artarmon or Willoughby, the second child,Deaths: Parr, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Wednesday, 27 March 1929), p16. and first daughter, of Letitia Evelyn née Forsyth (5 January 1906 – 21 April 1986) and Harold George Parr (1901 – 23 March 1970), an optometrist. During her childhood three of her siblings died, including one who was quite ill at birth and died at 18 months, and her parents divorced. She attended Presbyterian Ladies' College, Armidale, but \\"didn't do well in the Leaving at all\\" and failed to get a university pass. She began her career in radio at the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) in the early 1950s, becoming a junior broadcaster in children's programs. That led to her joining the cast of the Children's Session.A nice commentary on the Children's Session and the Argonauts Club Despite the pressure of live television and having no formal training, she started making weekly appearances on ABC Children's TV, and in 1960 began her most fondly-remembered role as 'Miss Pat' in ABC TV's children's television program Mr. Squiggle.Bolton, Jessica, \\"Mr Squiggle's Christmas Cards: From Norman Hetherington to Patricia Lovell\\", National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, December 2017. In 1964 Lovell became what she characterised as \\"one of the minor beauties\\" on the panel of Beauty and the Beast. When ATN-7's early morning Sydney Today show began in 1969 she and Bruce Webster were its co-presenters, and it was there as an interviewer that she met Peter Weir, the director with whom she would produce her two best- known films, Picnic at Hanging Rock and Gallipoli. In 1988 she and Mel Gibson formed a film production company \\"Lovell Gbson\\", but it was dissolved without making a film. Later career Lovell worked as Head of Producing at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School (AFTRS) between 1996 and 2003. Personal life Lovell met her husband, actor Nigel Lovell (1916-2001), through the Metropolitan Theatre in Sydney. He was a widower with a daughter. They married in 1956,Engagements: Lovell—Parr, The Sydney Morning Herald, (Saturday, 21 August 1954), p. 56. and had two children, Simon Lovell, a helicopter pilot, and Jenny Lovell, an actress known for her role on the soap opera Prisoner (called Prisoner: Cell Block H in the UK and the USA).

It deals with the history of non-Muslim populations during and after the conquest of their lands by Muslims. Overview The book contains 17 chapters by Bat Ye'or, as well as essays by Ibn Warraq, Walid Phares, David Littman, Patrick Sookhdeo, and Mark Durie. \\"The Myth of Islamic Tolerance: How Islamic Law Treats Non-Muslims, by Robert Spencer, Prometheus Books (2005) The writers opine that attitudes of Muslims today are informed by the tenets of Islam. It covers topics including sharia law and antisemitism. Reviews and reception A November 2004 review of the book in Publishers Weekly said the book's theme \\"merits exploration\\", but that the book does not explain why Islam is \\"inherently intolerant\\". An August 2005 review of the book in Asia Times opined that: > ... The Myth of Islamic Tolerance warrants our attention. Any study of > contemporary Islam would be incomplete without it. Collectively, the essays > expose an unsettling fact: that Islam's famed tolerance of non-Muslims has > over the centuries fallen well short of an embrace ... However, the book is > full of flagrant distortions and glaring omissions. The book was reviewed in the September 2005 issue of The Middle East Journal. A review in the June 2006 issue of First Things said that the book \\"might be described as an extended bill of indictment against Islam and a debunking of the still commonly heard claim that Islam has been and is tolerant of minorities.\\" Writing in National Review in March 2007, Dinesh D'Souza described The Myth of Islamic Tolerance as being attractive to those who would like to criticize Muslims at large for 9/11. He suggested that the book uses a strategy of selective quotations from the Koran, which he calls \\"history for dummies\\". Dr. Akbar Ahmed, professor of Islamic studies at American University, described the book as an example of one of the most humane religions in the world being misrepresented as a violent one. In his book Beyond the Veneer, Ioannis Gatsiounis says that the book \\"struggles to find an enlightened balance\\", as it sometimes overlooks complexities while at the same time avoiding a trend in many circles of viewing the issue it addresses solely as a non-religious one.

In DOS memory management, the upper memory area (UMA) refers to memory between the addresses of 640 KB and 1024 KB (0xA0000–0xFFFFF) in an IBM PC or compatible. IBM reserved the uppermost 384 KB of the 8088 CPU's 1024 KB address space for ROM, RAM on peripherals, and memory-mapped input/output. For example, the monochrome video memory area runs from 704 to 736 KB (0xB0000–B7FFF). However, even with video RAM, the ROM BIOS and I/O ports for expansion cards, much of this 384 KB of address space was unused. As the 640 KB memory restriction became ever more of an obstacle, techniques were found to fill the empty areas with RAM. These areas were referred to as upper memory blocks (UMBs).  Usage  The next stage in the evolution of DOS was for the operating system to use upper memory blocks (UMBs) and the high memory area (HMA). This occurred with the release of DR DOS 5.0 in 1990. DR DOS' built-in memory manager, EMM386.EXE, could perform most of the basic functionality of QEMM and comparable programs. The advantage of DR DOS 5.0 over the combination of an older DOS plus QEMM was that the DR DOS kernel itself and almost all of its data structures could be loaded into high memory. This left virtually all the base memory free, allowing configurations with up to 620 KB out of 640 KB free. Configuration was not automatic - free UMBs had to be identified by hand, manually included in the line that loaded EMM386 from CONFIG.SYS, and then drivers and so on had to be manually loaded into UMBs from CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. This configuration was not a trivial process. As it was largely automated by the installation program of QEMM, this program survived on the market; indeed, it worked well with DR DOS' own HMA and UMB support and went on to be one of the best-selling utilities for the PC. This functionality was copied by Microsoft with the release of MS-DOS 5.0 in June 1991. Eventually, even more DOS data structures were moved out of conventional memory, allowing up to 631 KB out of 640 KB to be left free. Starting from version 6.0 of MS- DOS, Microsoft even included a program called MEMMAKER which was used to automatically optimize conventional memory by moving TSR programs to the upper memory. For a period in the early 1990s, manual optimization of the DOS memory map became a highly prized skill, allowing for the largest applications to run on even the most complex PC configurations. The technique was to first create as many UMBs as possible, including remapping allocated but unused blocks of memory, such as the monochrome display area on colour machines. Then, DOS' many subcomponents had to be loaded into these UMBs in the correct sequence to use the blocks of memory as efficiently as possible. Some TSR programs required additional memory while loading, which was freed up again once loading was complete. Fortunately, there were few dependencies amongst these modules, so it was possible to load them in almost any sequence. Exceptions were that to successfully cache CD-ROMs, most disk caches had to be loaded after any CD-ROM drivers, and that the modules of most network stacks had to be loaded in a certain sequence, essentially working progressively up through the layers of the OSI model. A basic yet effective method used to optimize conventional memory was to load HIMEM.SYS as a device, thereafter loading EMM386.EXE as a device with the \\"RAM AUTO\\" option which allows access into the UMA by loading device drivers as devicehigh. This method effectively loads the fundamental memory managers into conventional memory, and thereafter everything else into the UMA. Conventional memory glutton programs such as MSCDEX could also be loaded into the UMA in a similar fashion, hence freeing up a large amount of conventional memory. =Windows= The increasing popularity of Windows 3.0 made the necessity of the upper memory area less relevant, as Windows applications were not directly affected by DOS' base memory limits, but DOS programs running under Windows (with Windows itself acting as a multitasking manager) were still thus constrained. With the release of Windows 95, it became less relevant still, as this version of Windows provides much of the functionality of the DOS device drivers to DOS applications running under Windows, such as CD, network and sound support; the memory map of Windows 95 DOS boxes was automatically optimised. However, not all DOS programs could execute in this environment. Specifically, programs that tried to directly switch from real mode to protected mode would not work as this was not allowed in the virtual 8086 mode it was running in. This point is now being addressed by x86 virtualization technologies such as Intel VT-x (Vanderpool) and AMD-V (Pacifica). Also, programs that tried making the switch using the Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) API (which was introduced to allow DOS programs that needed protected mode to enter it from the virtual 8086 mode set up by a memory manager, as described above) didn't work in Windows 95\\\\. Only the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) API for switching to protected mode was supported. Implementation =Virtual x86 Mode= Upper memory blocks can be created by mapping extended memory into the upper memory area when running in virtual x86 mode. This is similar to how expanded memory can be emulated using extended memory so this method of providing upper memory blocks is usually provided by the expanded memory manager (for example EMM386). The application programming interface for managing the upper memory blocks is specified in the eXtended Memory Specification. =Shadow RAM= On many systems including modern ones it is possible to use memory reserved for shadowing expansion card ROM as upper memory. Many chipsets reserve up to 384 KB RAM for this purpose and since this RAM is generally unused it may be used as real mode upper memory with a custom device driver, such as UMBPCI. =IBM XT= On IBM XT computers, it was possible to add more memory to the motherboard and use a custom address decoder PROM to make it appear in the upper memory area. As with the 386-based upper memory described above, the extra RAM could be used to load TSR files, or as a RAM disk. The AllCard, an add-on memory management unit for XT-class computers, allowed normal memory to be mapped into the 0xA0000-EFFFF address range, giving up to 952 KB for DOS programs. Programs such as Lotus 1-2-3, which accessed video memory directly, needed to be patched to handle this memory layout. Therefore, the 640 KB barrier was removed at the cost of software compatibility. This usage of the upper memory area is different from using upper memory blocks, which was used to free conventional memory by moving device drivers and TSRs into the upper 384 KB of the 1 MB address space, but left the amount of addressable memory (640 KB) intact.

His father was Prince Takechi and his mother Princess Minabe (a daughter of Emperor Tenji and Empress Genmei's sister). He married Princess Kibi (his cousin, a daughter of Empress Genmei and Empress Genshō's sister). He was substantially influential in politics owing to his membership of the Imperial family of the most noble birth, and there were no other competitive Imperial members at that time. A large residence was allocated to him in a prestigious part of Heijō-kyō. The Fujiwara clan were the most powerful competitors of Nagaya. Fujiwara no Fuhito, the leader of the house, had been the most powerful courtier in the court in the days when Japan was under the reign of Empress Genshō, a cousin of Nagaya's. After Fuhito's death in 720, Nagaya seized complete power within the court. This power shift was the source of later conflicts between him and Fuhito's four sons (Muchimaro, Fusasaki, Maro and Umakai) in the reign of Emperor Shōmu. In 729, the four sons charged him with a false crime and Nagaya received the death penalty. He was forced to commit suicide. His wife, Princess Kibi, and his children were killed at the same time.

The term \\"monozygous\\" is usually used to refer to a hypothetical gene as it is often difficult to characterise the effect of an individual gene from the effects of other genes and the environment on a particular phenotype. Advances in statistical methodology and high throughput sequencing are, however, allowing researchers to locate candidate genes for the trait. In the case that such a gene is identified, it is referred to as a quantitative trait locus (QTL). These genes are generally pleiotropic as well. The genes that contribute to type 2 diabetes are thought to be mostly polygenes.Emerging epidemic of type 2 diabetes in youth In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth. Traits with polygenic determinism correspond to the classical quantitative characters, as opposed to the qualitative characters with monogenic or oligogenic determinism. In essence instead of two options, such as freckles or no freckles, there are many variations, like the color of skin, hair, or even eyes. Overview Polygenic locus is any individual locus which is included in the system of genes responsible for the genetic component of variation in a quantitative (polygenic) character. Allelic substitutions contribute to the variance in a specified quantitative character. Polygenic locus may be either a single or complex genetic locus in the conventional sense, i.e., either a single gene or closely linked block of functionally related genes. In modern sense, the inheritance mode of polygenic patterns is called polygenic inheritance, whose main properties may be summarized as follows: #Most metric and meristic traits are controlled by a number of genetic loci. #Main mode of nonallelic genes interaction in corresponding gene series is addition of mainly small particular allele contributions. #The effects of allelic substitution at each of the segregating genes are usually relatively small and interchangeable which results that identical phenotype may be displayed by a great variety of genotypes. #The phenotypic expression of the polygenic characters is undergoing considerable modification by environmental influence. #Polygenic characters show a continuous rather than discontinuous distribution. #Balanced systems of polygenic inheritance in a population contain a great deal of potential genetic variability in the heterozygous condition and released by small increments through genetic recombination between linked polygenes. Inheritance Polygenic inheritance occurs when one characteristic is controlled by two or more genes. Often the genes are large in quantity but small in effect.Falconer, D. S. & Mackay TFC (1996). Introduction to Genetics. Fourth edition. Addison Wesley Longman, Harlow, Essex, UK. Examples of human polygenic inheritance are height, skin color, eye color and weight. Polygenes exist in other organisms, as well. Drosophila, for instance, display polygeny with traits such as wing morphology,Quantitative Trait Loci Affecting Components of Wing Shape in Drosophila melanogaster bristle count and many others. Trait distribution The frequency of the phenotypes of these traits generally follows a normal continuous variation distribution pattern. This results from the many possible allelic combinations. When the values are plotted, a bell-shaped curve is obtained. The mode of the distribution represents the optimal, or fittest, phenotype. The more genes are involved, the smoother the estimated curve. However, in this model all genes must code for alleles with additive effects. This assumption is often unrealistic as many genes display epistasis effects which can have unpredictable effects on the distribution of outcomes, especially when looking at the distribution on a fine scale. Mapping polygenes Example of a genome-wide scan for QTL of osteoporosis Traditionally, mapping polygenes requires statistical tools available to help measure the effects of polygenes as well as narrow in on single genes. One of these tools is QTL-mapping. QTL-mapping utilizes a phenomenon known as linkage disequilibrium by comparing known marker genes with correlated phenotypes. Often, researchers will find a large region of DNA, called a locus, that accounts for a significant amount of the variation observed in the measured trait. This locus will usually contain a large number of genes that are responsible. A new form of QTL has been described as expression QTL (eQTL). eQTLs regulate the amount of expressed mRNA, which in turn regulates the amount of protein within the organism. Another interest of statistical geneticists using QTL mapping is to determine the complexity of the genetic architecture underlying a phenotypic trait. For example, they may be interested in knowing whether a phenotype is shaped by many independent loci, or by a few loci, and do those loci interact. This can provide information on how the phenotype may be evolving.

He was raised in the United States. Biography =Interpol= It was Kessler's desire to play in a real band which made him approach Carlos Dengler, with whom he attended a history class in New York University. Kessler knew lead singer Paul Banks from a summer program in Paris, France, and asked him to join the band when he ran into him in New York. Kessler's dormmate Greg Drudy was Interpol's first drummer. When Drudy left the band, Kessler asked his friend Sam Fogarino to replace him. Kessler had prior experience in the music industry while working for Domino Recording Company, and his knowledge of the business was very helpful to the band in their early years. He brought all the members together, and has said that he was looking mostly for specific personal qualities each member could bring to the group rather than just musical talent. He is a graduate of New York University's (NYU) Gallatin School of Individualized Study in French, film and literature. Kessler has been known as the member of the band who has been the most active in the New York underground rock scene, which included his jobs at multiple record labels, such as Domino Records and trading their early demo tape around to various bands and labels. =Big Noble= In 2014, Kessler announced a new side project with sound designer Joseph Fraioli of Datach'i called Big Noble. Their debut album \\"First Light\\" was released on 2 February 2015. Gear In the band's early days, he was seen playing a red Rickenbacker and a sunburst Telecaster, but has since performed with a sunburst Epiphone Casino and a cherry Gibson ES-330 as his main onstage guitars. The red Rickenbacker apparently belonged to Interpol's first keyboardist. He also owned another Casino in a cherry red, that was stolen from their green room alongside one of Banks' guitars by a drug addict in Vancouver while the band was touring in support of Turn on the Bright Lights. Following Interpol's third album, Daniel has also been seen on stage playing a sunburst Gretsch 6117-TH Anniversary on the track 'The Lighthouse' and also on their self-titled album 'Interpol'. He states in an interview around 2006, following the release of Antics, that he plays through an old Fender Twin amplifier combined with a Fender Pro Reverb.

Essentially what this means: Japan's first head of government (or more precisely Yamato's) with the Ōkimi (later denoted Emperor) as head of state. He was the son of Soga no Koma and the father of Soga no Umako. Soga no Iname solidified his power by marrying two of his daughters, Soga no Kitashihime and Soga no Oanegimi, to Emperor Kinmei. Between the two of them they gave birth to three future emperors, Emperor Yōmei, Emperor Sushun and Empress Suiko, as well as numerous other princes and princesses. Soga no Iname is also known for his early support of Buddhism which, according to the Nihon Shoki, was introduced to the Yamato court from Paekche in 552. (However, according to a different source, the Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu, it was introduced in 538.) Opposing Iname and against the acceptance of this new foreign religion were Mononobe no Okoshi and Nakatomi no Kamako. The rivalry between the Sogas and the Mononobe and Nakatomi clans would carry on into future generations, with Iname's son Soga no Umako defeating Okoshi's son Mononobe no Moriya in 587, and his grandson and great-grandson Soga no Emishi and Soga no Iruka being defeated by a descendant of Kamako, Nakatomi no Kamatari, in the Isshi Incident.

His name was legally changed to Lockett in 1981, and he also goes by the name Nicky Lockett. Tunes played a significant role in the Madchester-music scene during the 1980s and 1990s. In his early career Tunes took niche music genres into the UK Singles Chart, whilst fronting 808 State, and later achieved cult status with the band Dust Junkys. In April 2014, it was announced that Damage by Stereo, Tunes 'lost' second album was to be finally released. 808 State Tunes first worked with 808 State on the 1990 album The North At Its Heights (ZTT Records).Larkin, Colin (1999) \\"MC Tunes\\" in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music, Virgin Books, , p. 219 The album was a moderate success, reaching number 26 in the UK Albums Chart, and also saw European and Japanese releases. It spawned three UK singles that entered the UK Singles Chart: \\"The Only Rhyme That Bites\\" (ZTT, 1990) reached number 10 and again (ZTT,1992) reached number 47, \\"Tunes Splits The Atom\\" (ZTT, 1990) number 18 and \\"Primary Rhyming\\" (ZTT, 1990) peaked at number 67 – this was also the first of the singles to have the 'versus 808 State' wording removed from the cover credits. Each single was supported by a promotional video. On 19 November 2011 a deluxe edition of The North At Its Heights was released by ZTT Records in Japan, due to a resurgence of interest in this work. The release featured seven additional tracks including \\"Dance Yourself To Death\\" – Dust Bros club mix: remixed by the Dust Bros; and a remake of \\"The Only Rhyme That Bites\\" – Ugly as Sin mix: remixed and remodelled by Tunes for the release. In 1992, Tunes recorded the single \\"Digital Bad Boy\\" / \\"Could You Understand\\" (Juice Box) with A Guy Called Gerald. 'The Only Rhyme That Bites' video was recorded in the basement of the old Express Newspapers building on Ancoats Lane. Damage by Stereo With the success of the 808 State collaborations and his growing reputation on the global hip hop scene, ZTT Records signed a separate deal with MC Tunes. With the project being overseen by Trevor Horn, recording began at Sarm Studios on a series of tracks in 1991. The result was nine tracks which, with an addition of a new version of \\"Dance Yourself To Death\\" produced by the Dust Brothers, were intended to be released in album format under the title Damage by Stereo. It is unclear why at the time of its making the album was not released but, in 2012, the entire collection of missing master tapes were rediscovered. In April 2014, it was announced that \\"Damage by Stereo\\" was to be released by Peter Hook's Haçienda Records label. Tracks from the album were previewed in an event at Factory Manchester on Saturday 19 April in an event hosted by Clint Boon of XFM and Inspiral Carpets billed as an evening of talk, tape and performance. The music was played from the original half inch master tapes which had been treated by Advanced Media Restoration in Manchester and played from a reel to reel machine. The event also saw MC Tunes performing material over instrumental versions of the tracks retrieved from the tapes. As no album art had been prepared for the original release Mancunian artist Jay Smith provided the backdrop for the stage as he painted the cover art for Damage by Stereo. On Monday 9 February 2015 \\"Damage By Stereo\\" was eventually released, almost 24 years after it was originally recorded. The album was made available on a limited edition double CD, Serial Number HAC018, featuring the 10 original tracks intended for the album and a five track bonus disc featuring dance remixes by 808 State's Andy Barker, DJ & Producer Mark Wells, the Dust Brothers, TtrueAR and The Laboratory Project. Two slightly different versions of the CD were manufactured. One hundred copies were created for guests at the official album launch party held at South Manchester, with another limited batch of CDs being produced for general release. The album was also made available digitally through Hacienda Records and on various other digital platforms including iTunes and Spotify. Dust Junkys Following the stalling of his solo career, Tunes formed the Dust Junkys in 1995, with Sam Brox on guitar, Stephen \\"OJ\\" Oliver Jones on bass guitar, Mykey Wilson on drums and Ganiyu Pierre Gasper on turntables. The band concentrated on gigging in the Manchester area and then national tours, building audiences for their mix of British hip hop and rock music. Whilst gigging with the Dust Junkys, Tunes returned to work with 808 State in 1996 on a new track, \\"Pump\\", taken from their album Thermo Kings (Warner). It was due to be released as a single, but this never happened. The Dust Junkys were signed to Polydor and released their first single \\"Living in the Pocket of a Drug Queen?\\" (1997), followed by \\"(Nonstopoperation)\\" and \\"What Time Is It?\\" which reached number 39 in the UK chart. The Dust Junkys music was subject to remixes by artists such as Fun Loving Criminals. The track \\"Fever\\" was featured on the soundtrack for the Sony PlayStation game, Driver 2. The most widely recognized piece of Dust Junkys music, originally called \\"Rinse (Beatbox Wash)\\", released as the B-side of \\"Living in the Pocket of a Drug Queen?\\", came to prominence as the main hook of Fatboy Slim's \\"Gangster Trippin'\\". The track peaked at number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. \\"Gangster Trippin'\\" was also featured on the Fatboy Slim album You've Come a Long Way, Baby, where 25% of the songwriting credits were attributed to Dust Junkys and MC Tunes. Filmography In 1990, ZTT Records commissioned film maker Howard Walmsley to create a film to promote MC Tunes music career. This became the foundation for a film called Nish Clish Banging, The MC Tunes Tapes which was completed in 2011, and shown in art house cinemas in the North West of England. The University of Central Lancashire screened the film to a capacity crowd at the Mitchell and Kenyon cinema in Preston, Lancashire, on 15 November 2012. The screening was followed by Terry Christian conducting an interview with Lockett and Walmsley, and a question and answer session with the audience. In the interview, Tunes candidly talked about the controversy that had surrounded his career and personal life. In addition to being featured in music promotional films, in 2007 Tunes played himself in the independent feature film, Diary of a Bad Lad. Personal life Tunes still lives in Manchester.

In Greek mythology, Caanthus or Kaanthos (; Ancient Greek: Καάνθου) was the son of Oceanus and Tethys, and the brother of Melia, who was the consort of Apollo, and an important cult figure at Thebes.Smith, s.v. Caanthus. According to the second-century geographer Pausanias, Caanthus was commanded by his father Oceanus to seek his sister Melia, who had been abducted by Apollo. But being unable to get Melia away from Apollo, Caanthus set fire to the Apollo's sanctuary, and Apollo shot and killed him.Pausanias, 9.10.5-6. The story of Caanthus is a close parallel to the more famous story of Cadmus, the founder and first king of Thebes. Like Caanthus, Cadmus' sister Europa is abducted by an Olympian god (in this case Zeus), and Cadmus is sent by his father to bring Europa back home, and like Caanthus, Cadmus is unsuccessful.Larson, p. 142, describes Caanthus' story as \\"clearly a doublet of the better-known myth\\" of Cadmus; Schachter 1967, p. 4, calls Caanthus and Melia's story an \\"imitation\\" of the story of Cadmus and Europa; see also Schachter 1981, p. 79; Fontenrose, p. 318. Caanthus' story is perhaps also related to the story of the Theban Amphion.Schachter 1967, p. 4. According to Hyginus, Amphion, like Caanthus, was shot and killed by Apollo because of an attack on his temple.Hyginus, Fabulae 9 (Smith and Trzaskoma, p. 99). According to Pausanias, Caanthus was buried near a spring above the Ismenion, the Temple of Apollo at Thebes. Pausanias identified the spring as the famous spring of Ares, where Cadmus killed the dragon guarding it.Larson, p. 142; Fontenrose, p. 318; Pausanias, 9.10.5.

Dizengoff's actions in Ottoman Palestine and the British Mandate for Palestine helped lead to the creation of the State of Israel. David Ben-Gurion declared Israeli independence in 1948 at Dizengoff's residence in Tel Aviv. Dizengoff House is now Israel's Independence Hall. Early Life Meir Dizengoff was born in 1861 in the village of Ekimovtsy near Orhei, Bessarabia.Dizengoff bio In 1878, his family moved to Kishinev, where he graduated from high school and studied at the polytechnic school. In 1882, he volunteered in the Imperial Russian Army, serving in Zhytomyr (now in the northwestern Ukraine) until 1884. There he first met , whom he married in the early 1890s. After his military service, Dizengoff remained in Odessa, where he became involved in the Narodnaya Volya underground. In 1885, he was arrested for insurgency. In Odessa, he met Leon Pinsker, Ahad Ha’am and others, and joined the Hovevei Zion movement. Upon his release from prison, Dizengoff returned to Kishinev and founded the Bessarabian branch of Hovevei Zion, which he represented at the 1887 conference. He left Kishinev in 1889 to study in Paris. Zionist Leadership Albert Einstein meeting with Meir Dizengoff In Kishinev Dizengoff met Theodor Herzl and became an ardent follower. However, Dizengoff strongly opposed the British Uganda Scheme promoted by Herzl at the Sixth Zionist Congress. Instead, Dizengoff favored the formation of Jewish communities in Palestine. Dizengoff became actively involved in land purchases and establishment of Jewish communities, most notably Tel Aviv. Dizengoff was widely regarded as a leader of the Jewish community prior to the establishment of the State of Israel. Many notable world leaders who traveled to Ottoman Palestine and the British Mandate for Palestine met with Meir Dizengoff as a representative of the Jewish community. Winston Churchill meeting with Meir Dizengoff in Tel Aviv Meir Dizengoff with Alfred Balfour 1925 Winston Churchill visited Palestine in March 1921 and met with Dizengoff. During a ceremonial speech with Churchill, Dizengoff declared: “this small town of Tel-Aviv, which is hardly 12 years old, has been conquered by us on sand dunes, and we have built it with our work and our exertions.” Churchill was impressed with the motivation and determination of the pioneers, under the leadership of Dizengoff. In Palestine, Churchill told an anti-Zionist delegation: “This country has been very much neglected in the past and starved and even mutilated by Turkish misgovernment… you can see with your own eyes in many parts of this country the work which has already been done by Jewish colonies; how sandy wastes have been reclaimed and thriving farms and orangeries planted in their stead.” That same day he told a Jewish delegation he would inform London that the Zionists are “transforming waste into fertile..planting trees and developing agriculture in desert lands...making for an increase in wealth and cultivation\\" and further that the Arab population is “deriving great benefit, sharing in the general improvement and advancement.” https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ Business ventures While studying chemical engineering at the University of Paris, Dizengoff met Edmond James de Rothschild, who sent him to Ottoman-ruled Palestine to establish a glass factory which would supply bottles for Rothschild's wineries. Dizengoff opened the factory in Tantura in 1892, but it proved unsuccessful due to impurities in the sand, and Dizengoff soon returned to Kishinev. In 1905, spurred by his Zionist beliefs, Dizengoff returned to Palestine and settled in Jaffa. He established the Geulah company, which bought up land in Palestine from Arabs, and became involved in the import business, especially machinery and automobiles to replace the horse-drawn carriages that had served as the primary transportation from Jaffa port to Jerusalem and other towns. He also co-founded a boat company that bore his name, and served as the Belgian consul. When Dizengoff learned that residents were organizing to build a new neighborhood, Tel Aviv, he formed a partnership with the Ahuzat Bayit company and bought land on the outskirts of Jaffa, which was parceled out to the early settlers by lot. Founding of Tel Aviv Founding of Tel Aviv Dizengoff was one of the founders of the Ahuzat Bayit Company, organized to establish a modern Jewish quarter near the Arab city of Jaffa in 1909. On April 11, 1909, sixty-six families gathered on the sandy shoreline to divide up lots of what was to become Tel Aviv. Meir Dizengoff, the civic leader who would be the city's first mayor, participated in the lottery. The moment was captured on film by Abraham Suskind. In the iconic image, members of the collective can be seen standing on sand dunes in the exact location where Rothschild Boulevard currently runs. According to legend, the man standing behind the group, on the slope of the sand dune, is a man who opposed the idea, allegedly telling the others that they are mad because there is no water at the location. Mayor of Tel Aviv Meir Dizengoff Dizengoff became head of the town planning in 1911, a position that he held until 1922. When Tel Aviv was recognized as a city, Dizengoff was elected mayor. He remained in office until his death, apart from a three-year hiatus in 1925–1928. During World War I, the Ottomans drove out a large part of the population and Dizengoff was the liaison between the exiles and the Ottoman authorities. In this position he dealt with aid sent to the exiles of Tel Aviv and received the nickname Reish Galuta. He widely circulated and publicised the plight of the exiles, mainly via newspapers, and succeeded in convincing the rulers to agree to a regular supply of food and provisions to the exiles. In 1917, after having received funding from Nili, Dizengoff refused not only to provide funds to free Nili member Yosef Lishansky, but even funds to provide the succor that Dizengoff provided other prisoners and even anti-Zionists, despite having received the money from Nili. Many committees and associations came into being during Dizengoff's term as mayor. One was the Levant Fair (Hebrew Yarid HaMizrah) committee, founded in 1932, which organized its first fair that year. Initially, the fair was held in the south of the city, but after its great success, a fairground with designated buildings was built in north Tel Aviv. A large international fair was held in 1934, followed by a second fair two years later. Meir Dizengoff's funeral, 24 September 1936, Tel Aviv. Photo by Matson Photo Service. Dizengoff was consequently involved with the development of the city, and encouraged its rapid expansion—carrying out daily inspections, and paying attention to details such as entertainment. He was always present at the head of the Adloyada, the annual Purim carnival. After his wife's death, he donated his house to the city of Tel Aviv, for use as an art museum, and he influenced many important artists to donate their work to improve the museum. In 1936, with the outbreak of the Arab revolt, the Arabs closed the port of Jaffa with the intention of halting the rapid expansion of Jewish settlements in Palestine. Dizengoff pressured the government to give him permission to open a port in his new city of Tel Aviv, and before his death he managed to dedicate the first pier of Tel Aviv's new port. His dedication began with the words: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, I can still remember the day when Tel Aviv had no port\\". After years of building houses, hospitals, public institutions, a synagogue, etc. Dizengoff wrote “we began to feel the need to foster beauty”. On a visit to Paris, Dizengoff created an artistic committee. Marc Chagall wrote: “Mr. Dizengoff came to me in Paris, asking for help in building a museum. I couldn’t believe the man was seventy years old, his eyes sparkled…though I intended several times to go to the Land of Israel, and every time I cancelled the trip- this time, Mr. Dizengoff’s enthusiasm influenced me.. I packed my things and decided to give him a hand.” In June 1931, Marc Chagall and his family traveled to Tel Aviv, on the invitation of Dizengoff, in conjunction with his plan to build a Jewish Museum in the new city. They were invited to stay at Dizengoff's house in Tel Aviv. Dizengoff died on September 23, 1936. Dizengoff House / Independence Hall Interior of Dizengoff house, now Independence Hall, where Ben Gurion declared Israeli independence on 14 May 1948 In 1930, after the death of his wife, Dizengoff donated his house to his beloved city of Tel Aviv and requested that it be turned into a museum. The house underwent extensive renovations and became the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1932. The museum moved to its current location in 1971. On 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared the independence of the State of Israel at the Dizengoff residence. The building is now a history museum and known as Independence Hall. There is a monument at Dizengoff House (Independence Hall) honoring both the 66 original families of Tel Aviv as well as a statue of Dizengoff riding his famous horse. A statue of Meir Dizengoff riding his horse, located on Rothschild Boulevard, Tel Aviv Commemoration Meir Park and Dizengoff Street are named after him.Dizengoff bio His name also lives on in Israeli slang: It was used as a verb—lehizdangeff—which means \\"to walk down Dizengoff,\\" i.e., go out on the town.

However, in the tenor clef, it would require a ledger line and so G is placed lower than C.  History  Although not as rare in the symphonic literature as sharper keys, examples of symphonies in A major are not as numerous as for D major or G major. Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 and Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 4 comprise a nearly complete list of symphonies in this key in the Romantic era. Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet are both in A major, along with his 23rd piano concerto, and generally Mozart was more likely to use clarinets in A major than in any other key besides E-flat major. Moreover, the climax part of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto is also in A major. The key of A major occurs frequently in chamber music and other music for strings, which favor sharp keys. Franz Schubert's Trout Quintet and Antonín Dvořák's Piano Quintet No. 2 are both in A major. Johannes Brahms, César Franck, and Gabriel Fauré wrote violin sonatas in A major.

History The first edition was published on February 10, 1900. The paper succeeded the Morning Herald and was absorbed by the Baltimore Evening Herald on August 31, 1904, appearing on weekends as the Baltimore Sunday Herald. Its offices were located at the northwest corner of St. Paul and East Fayette Streets, facing the recently completed Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses of 1896-1900 (renamed for Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr. in 1985). The building was devastated by the Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904 and stood on the northern edge of the \\"Burnt District\\". The Herald printed an edition the first night of the fire on the press of The Washington Post, in exchange for providing photographs to The Post, but could not continue this arrangement because of a long-standing arrangement between the Post and the Baltimore Evening News. For the next five weeks The Herald was printed nightly on the press of the Philadelphia Evening Telegraph and transported to Baltimore on a special train, provided free of charge by the B&O; Railroad. In June 1906, the paper was purchased by competitor Charles H. Grasty, editor/owner of The Evening News, and Gen. Felix Agnus, owner/publisher of The Baltimore American. Assets, staff and resources of the Herald were divided between the two publications, which later merged under the ownership of newspaper magnate Frank Munsey. The Herald's most notable writer and editor was H. L. Mencken, who described his experiences in Newspaper Days (1941), the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy.

Few large-scale works in B major exist: these include Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 46. The aria \\"La donna è mobile\\" from Verdi's opera Rigoletto is in the key, as is the \\"Flower Duet\\" from Lakmé. Johannes Brahms's Piano Trio No. 1, Op. 8 is in B major, though the piece ends in B minor. Brahms also wrote the slow movement to his Second Symphony in B major, as well as the fourth and last piece of the Ballades, Op. 10. The Tuileries movement from Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is in the key. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s Manfred Symphony in B minor ends in B major.

It is a large omnivore and extensively used in aquaculture. Description The rohu is a large, silver- colored fish of typical cyprinid shape, with a conspicuously arched head. Adults can reach a maximum weight of and maximum length of , but average around . Distribution and habitat The rohu occurs in rivers throughout much of northern and central and eastern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar, and has been introduced into some of the rivers of Peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Ecology The species is an omnivore with specific food preferences at different life stages. During the early stages of its lifecycle, it eats mainly zooplankton, but as it grows, it eats more and more phytoplankton, and as a juvenile or adult is a herbivorous column feeder, eating mainly phytoplankton and submerged vegetation. It has modified, thin hair-like gill rakers, suggesting that it feeds by sieving the water. Rohu reach sexual maturity between two and five years of age. They generally spawn during the monsoon season, keeping to the middle of flooded rivers above tidal reach. The spawning season of rohu generally coincides with the southwest monsoon. Spawn may be collected from rivers and reared in tanks and lakes. Aquaculture The rohu is an important aquacultured freshwater species in South Asia. When cultured, it does not breed in lake ecosystems, so induced spawning is necessary. The rohu is also prized as a game fish. Preparation as food Fried Rohu dish, Bangladesh. Rohu is very commonly eaten in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and the Indian states of Tripura, Nagaland, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. A recipe for fried Rohu fish is mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka. In this recipe, the fish is marinated in asafoetida and salt after being skinned. It is then dipped in turmeric mixed in water before being fried.

In most Central and Northern European languages (German, Hungarian, Nordic, Baltic, Western and most Southern Slavic languages), the pitch B is usually called \\"H\\" while B is called \\"B\\".  History  Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 98 is credited as the first symphony he (or anyone else) wrote in that key in which he included trumpet and timpani parts. Actually, his brother Michael Haydn had written one such symphony earlier, No. 36, though Joseph Haydn still gets credit for writing the timpani part at actual pitch with an F major key signature (instead of transposing with a C major key signature), a procedure that made sense since he limited that instrument to the tonic and dominant pitches.H. C. Robbins Landon, Haydn Symphonies, London: British Broadcasting Corporation (1966): 57 Many editions of the work, however, use no key signature and specify the instrument as \\"Timpani in B–F\\".

It consists mainly of chanted hymns in rhythm with instruments such as cymbals (hand and large size) and the triangle. Coptic music is purely religious. Coptic chant is a very old tradition, assumed to have links with the ancient liturgies of Jerusalem or Syria, while some of the melodies had been adopted from Ancient Egyptian burial practices and other rituals; however, manuscripts survive only since recent times and little is known for sure about the older tradition. Until these recent liturgical books, the music was transmitted orally. In the modern chant, there is extensive use of melody types, which allow some improvisation by the singers. The percussion instruments used in the Coptic Church are unusual among Christian liturgies. Since similar instruments appear in ancient Egyptian frescoes and reliefs, some believe that they may represent a survival from a very old tradition.

Its parallel minor, A-flat minor, is usually replaced by G-sharp minor, since A-flat minor, which would contain seven flats, is not normally used. Its enharmonic, G-sharp major, with eight sharps, including the F, has a similar problem, and so A-flat major is often used as the parallel major for G-sharp minor. (The same enharmonic situation occurs with the keys of D-flat major and C-sharp minor.)  Compositions in A-flat major  Beethoven chose A-flat major as the key of the slow movement for most of his C minor works, a practice which Anton Bruckner imitated in his first two C minor symphonies and also Antonín Dvořák in his only C minor symphony. The second movement of Haydn’s 43rd symphony in E-flat major is in A-flat major. Chopin used this key in many of his works. Since A-flat major was not often chosen as the main key for orchestral works of the 18th century, passages or movements in the key often retained the timpani settings of the preceding movement. For example, Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor has the timpani set to C and G for the first movement. With hand-tuned timpani, there is no time to re-tune the timpani to A-flat and E-flat for the slow second movement in A-flat; accordingly, the timpani in this movement are reserved for the passages in C major. In Bruckner's Symphony No. 1 in C minor, however, the timpani are re- tuned between the first movement in C minor and the following in A-flat major. Charles-Marie Widor considered A-flat major to be the second best key for flute music.Charles-Marie Widor, Manual of Practical Instrumentation translated by Edward Suddard, Revised Edition. London: Joseph Williams, Ltd. (1946) Reprinted Mineola, New York: Dover (2005): 11. \\"No key suits it [the flute] better than D-flat [major]. ... A-flat [major] is likewise an excellent key.\\" A-flat major was the flattest major key to be used as the home key for the keyboard and piano sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti, Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, with each of them using the key for two sonatas: Scarlatti's K. 127 and K. 130, Haydn's Hob XVI 43 and 46, and Beethoven's Op. 26 and Op. 110, while Franz Schubert used it for one piano sonata. It was also the flattest major key to be used for the preludes and fugues in Johann Sebastian Bach's Well-Tempered Klavier, as flatter major keys were notated as their enharmonic equivalents. Felix Mendelssohn, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, John Field, and Friedrich Kalkbrenner each wrote one piano concerto in A-flat (Mendelssohn's being for two pianos); they had the horns and trumpet tuned to E-flat. Max Bruch's Concerto for Two Pianos in A-flat minor has its last movement in A-flat major, which is the parallel major; this concerto plays with the contrast between the two keys. Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag is also written in A-flat major (the trio part of the composition is written in D-flat major).

Not being in full silhouette, the effect is subtle and may not be noticed. Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the \\"real\\" subject of an image. Overview The use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The Japanese word \\"ma\\" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in garden design. In a two-tone, black-and-white image, a subject is normally depicted in black and the space around it is left blank (white), thereby forming a silhouette of the subject. Reversing the tones so that the space around the subject is printed black and the subject itself is left blank, however, causes the negative space to be apparent as it forms shapes around the subject. This is called figure- ground reversal. In graphic design of printed or displayed materials, where effective communication is the objective, the use of negative space may be crucial. Not only within the typography, but in its placement in relation to the whole. It is the basis of why upper and lower case typography always is more legible than the use of all capital letters. Negative space varies around lower case letters, allowing the human eye to distinguish each word rapidly as one distinctive item, rather than having to parse out what the words are in a string of letters that all present the same overall profile as in all caps. The same judicious use of negative space drives the effectiveness of the entire design. Because of the long history of the use of black ink on white paper, \\"white space\\" is the term often used in graphics to identify the same separation. Elements of an image that distract from the intended subject, or in the case of photography, objects in the same focal plane, are not considered negative space. Negative space may be used to depict a subject in a chosen medium by showing everything around the subject, but not the subject itself. Use of negative space will produce a silhouette of the subject. Most often, negative space is used as a neutral or contrasting background to draw attention to the main subject, which then is referred to as the positive space. Use Considering and improving the balance between negative space and positive space in a composition is considered by many to enhance the design. This basic, but often overlooked, principle of design gives the eye a \\"place to rest,\\" increasing the appeal of a composition through subtle means. The use of negative space in art may be analogous to silence in music, but only when it is juxtaposed with adjacent musical ideas. As such, there is a difference between inert and active silences in music, where the latter is more closely analogous to negative space in art. Negative space in art, also referred to as \\"air space\\", is the space around and between objects. Instead of focusing on drawing the actual object, for a negative space drawing, the focus is on what's between the objects. For example, if one is drawing a plant, they would draw the space in-between the leaves, not the actual leaves. This technique requires one to forget about a conceptual meaning of an object and forces them to observe through shapes, rather than drawing what they may think an object looks like.

It is enharmonically equivalent to C-sharp major. Its key signature has five flats. The D-flat major scale is: : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\time 7/4 des4 es f ges aes bes c des c bes aes ges f es des2 \\\\clef bass \\\\key des \\\\major } } Its relative minor is B-flat minor. Its parallel minor, D-flat minor, is usually replaced by C-sharp minor, since D-flat minor features a B in its key signature and C-sharp minor only has four sharps, making it rare for D-flat minor to be used. C-sharp major, its enharmonic, with seven sharps, has a similar problem. Therefore, D-flat major is often used as the parallel major for C-sharp minor. (The same enharmonic situation occurs with the keys of A-flat major and G-sharp minor). For example, in his Prelude No. 15 in D-flat major (\\"Raindrop\\"), Frédéric Chopin switches from D-flat major to C-sharp minor for the middle section in the parallel minor, while in his Fantaisie-Impromptu and Scherzo No. 3, primarily in C-sharp minor, he switches to D-flat major for the middle section for the opposite reason. Ferdinand Ries' third concerto likewise switches to D-flat major for a while for the return of the second theme in the first movement. Claude Debussy also switches from D-flat major to C-sharp minor in the significant section in his famous \\"Clair de lune\\". Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony likewise switches to C-sharp minor for a while for the significant section in the slow movement. D-flat major is enharmonic to C-sharp major. In music for the harp, D-flat major would be preferable, not only because harp strings are more resonant in the flat position and the key has fewer accidentals, but also because modulation to the dominant key is easier (by putting the G pedal in the natural position, whereas there is no double-sharp position in which to put the F pedal for G-sharp major).  Compositions in D-flat major  Hector Berlioz called this key \\"majestic\\" in his 1856 Grand Traité d'Instrumentation et d'Orchestration modernes, while having a much different opinion of its enharmonic counterpart. Despite this, when he came to orchestrate Carl Maria von Weber's piano piece Invitation to the Dance in 1841, he transposed it from D-flat to D major, to give the strings a more manageable key and to produce a brighter sound.The Hector Berlioz Website Charles-Marie Widor considered D-flat major to be the best key for flute music.Charles-Marie Widor, Manual of Practical Instrumentation translated by Edward Suddard, Revised Edition. London: Joseph Williams, Ltd. (1946) Reprinted Mineola, New York: Dover (2005): 11. \\"No key suits it [the flute] better than D-flat [major].\\" Although this key was relatively unexplored during the Baroque and Classical periods and was not often used as the main key for orchestral works of the 18th century, Franz Schubert used it quite frequently in his sets of écossaises, valses and so on, as well as entering it and even flatter keys in his sonatas, impromptus and the like. Ludwig van Beethoven, too, used this key extensively in his second piano concerto. D-flat major was used as the key for the slow movements of Joseph Haydn's Piano Sonata Hob XVI:46 in A-flat major, and Beethoven's Appassionata Sonata. A part of the trio of Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag is written in D-flat major. The flattened pitches of D-flat major correspond to the black keys of the piano, and there is much significant piano music written in this key. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 is written in B-flat minor, but the famous opening theme is in D-flat major. Tchaikovsky composed the second movement of Piano Concerto No. 1 also in D-flat. Sergei Rachmaninoff composed the famous 18th variation of his Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini in this key, perhaps emphasizing the generally held view that D-flat major is the most romantically flavoured of the major keys; and his friend Nikolai Medtner similarly chose it for the sensually romantic \\"big tune\\" in the last movement of his Piano Concerto No. 3 (\\"Ballade\\"). Claude Debussy also composed the famous \\"Clair de lune\\" in this key, with a significant section in C-sharp minor. Edvard Grieg composed the second movement of his Piano Concerto in D-flat. Frédéric Chopin's Nocturne in D-flat, Op. 27 and Berceuse, Op. 57 are in this key. Franz Liszt composed heavily in this key, with his most recognizable piece being the third movement of his piano composition Trois études de concert, dubbed \\"Un sospiro\\". Liszt took advantage of the piano's configuration of the key and used it to create an arpeggiating melody using alternating hands. In orchestral music, the examples are fewer. Gustav Mahler concluded his last completed Ninth Symphony with an adagio in D-flat major, rather than the home key of D major of the first movement. Anton Bruckner wrote the third movement of his Symphony No. 8 in D-flat major, while every other movement is in C minor. Antonín Dvořák wrote the second movement of his Symphony No. 9 in D-flat major, while every other movement is in E minor. The first piano concerto of Sergei Prokofiev is also written in D-flat major, with a short slow movement in G-sharp minor. Aram Khachaturian wrote his Piano Concerto, Op. 38, in the key of D-flat major. Choral writing explores D-flat infrequently, notable examples being Robert Schumann's Requiem, Op. 148, Gabriel Fauré's Cantique de Jean Racine and Sergei Rachmaninoff's \\"Nuncs Dimittis\\" from his All-Night Vigil, Op. 37. Vincent d'Indy's String Quartet No. 3, Op. 96, is in D-flat.

He played college football for the University of Tennessee, and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the second round of the 2000 NFL Draft. With the Packers, he won Super Bowl XLV over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Early years Clifton was born in Martin, Tennessee. At Westview High School in Martin, Clifton was an all-around athlete. He lettered four times in football, starting his last three seasons as a two-way player. In addition to football, he was on the basketball team for three years. Throughout his high school years, Clifton played on the defensive tackle position and on tight end as a sophomore and offensive tackle in his junior and senior years. As a senior, he was named an All-American by Parade and Scholastic Coach magazines and received the Gatorade Circle of Champions \\"Player of the Year\\" award and Tennessee Class 2A Mr. Football lineman award. Clifton's team lost in the state playoffs in his junior and senior years to Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Tennessee, whose offensive coordinator was former Ole Miss head coach Hugh Freeze. College career In 1995, Clifton enrolled at the University of Tennessee and redshirted his first year. From then on, he was a fixture on the offensive line. He started one season at the right tackle position and three at the left tackle position. During these four years, the Tennessee Volunteers enjoyed great success with a 43-7 record and a win in the Fiesta Bowl over Florida State following the 1998 regular season to claim the National Championship. Clifton was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference selection (1997 second team, 1998 first team) and a Sporting News second-team All-American as a senior. Professional career =Green Bay Packers= Clifton with the Packers in 2006 During the 2000 NFL Draft, the Packers selected Clifton in the second round with the 44th overall pick. Halfway through his rookie season, Clifton took over the starting left tackle position and would remain there for the rest of the season. He enjoyed continued success during his second season when he established a reputation as one of the NFL's best and unheralded blindside blockers for Brett Favre. Clifton's 2002 season seemed as promising as his first two. However, on November 24, he suffered a severe pelvic injury after receiving a blindside hit from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Warren Sapp. Because the incident occurred after an interception with Clifton far from the play, Sapp received harsh criticism for his action. After the game, when Packers head coach Mike Sherman told Sapp that his play was uncalled for, Sapp began angrily shouting at Sherman in a tirade that was caught on camera, with Sapp famously screaming \\"put a jersey on\\". As a result of his injury, Clifton missed the rest of the season, was hospitalized for almost a week, and could not walk unaided for five more weeks. In 2005, the NFL Competition Committee agreed on new guidelines for \\"unnecessary roughness\\", making hits such as that suffered by Clifton illegal. Clifton returned in 2003 to start all 16 regular season games and two more games in the playoffs. He played all 1,031 offensive snaps that season and contributed to establishing a team record for fewest sacks allowed in a season with 19. On January 23, 2008, it was announced that he would replace Seattle Seahawks tackle Walter Jones in the 2008 Pro Bowl, which was his first career Pro Bowl. He went to Hawaii to the Pro Bowl with teammates wide receiver Donald Driver, defensive end Aaron Kampman, and cornerback Al Harris, as well as head coach Mike McCarthy. Clifton's quarterback, Brett Favre, was scheduled to be in the Pro Bowl, but was replaced by Jeff Garcia. On March 5, 2010, the Packers re-signed Clifton to a three-year, $20 million contract, with $7.5 million guaranteed. At the end of the 2010 season, Clifton and the Packers appeared in Super Bowl XLV. He was a starter in the 31–25 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Clifton had a successful season in 2010, which culminated in his second career Pro Bowl nomination. On April 23, 2012, Clifton was released by the Packers after failing a physical. Clifton did not sign with another NFL team after his release.

Its key signature has six flats. Its relative minor is E-flat minor (or enharmonically D-sharp minor), and its parallel minor is G-flat minor, usually replaced by F-sharp minor, since G-flat minor's two double-flats make it generally impractical to use.

It is more often used as a main key for piano works, such as the impromptus of Chopin and Schubert. It is the predominant key of Maurice Ravel's Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet. A striking use of G-flat major can be found in the love duet \\"Tu l'as dit\\" that concludes the fourth act of Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera Les Huguenots. Italian composer Ottorino Respighi composed Notturno in G-flat major, composed in 1904. When writing works in all 24 major and minor keys, Alkan, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, Shchedrin and Winding used G-flat major over F-sharp major. Muzio Clementi chose F-sharp in his set for the prelude, but G-flat for the final \\"Grande Exercice\\" which modulates through all the keys. Antonín Dvořák composed Humoresque No. 7 in G-flat major, while its middle section is F-sharp minor. Gustav Mahler was fond of using G-flat major in key passages of his symphonies. Examples include: the choral entry during the finale of his Second Symphony,Mahler, Gustav. Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2 in Full Score, Dover, (1987) p. 354. during the first movement of his Third Symphony,Mahler, Gustav. Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 in Full Score, Dover, (1989), p. 53. the modulatory section of the Adagietto from his Fifth Symphony,Mahler, Gustav.

Mahler's Tenth Symphony was composed in the enharmonic key of F-sharp major. This key is more often found in piano music, as the use of all five black keys allows an easier conformity to the player's hands, despite the numerous flats. In particular, the black keys G, A, B, D, and E correspond to the 5 notes of the G-flat Pentatonic Scale. Austrian composer Franz Schubert chose this key for his third impromptu from his first collection of impromptus (1827). Polish composer Frédéric Chopin wrote two études in the key of G-flat major: Étude Op. 10, No. 5 \\"Black Key\\" and Étude Op. 25, No. 9 \\"Butterfly\\". French composer Claude Debussy used this key for one of his most popular compositions, La fille aux cheveux de lin, the eighth prélude from his Préludes, Book I (1909-1910).

It is served by Sydney Trains T1 Western and T5 Cumberland line services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Windsor station opened on 1 December 1864 coinciding with that of the Richmond line.Windsor Station NSWrail.netWindsot Railway Station Group & Former Goods Yard NSW Environment & Heritage It was constructed by W & A Elphinstone. The original station building was a combination residence and office, as were built at Riverstone railway station and Mulgrave railway station on the same line. This was purchased and relocated to be converted into a private home in Milhelm Street. A major upgrading of most stations on this line occurred in the 1880s, including Windsor. In April 1883 the contract for a brick station building and platform was awarded to G. Jones. The station was rebuilt with the goods yard including the brick faced platform. The present brick platform building dates from 1884 and its design reflects similar buildings at Riverstone and Richmond. A skillion roof and timber clad signal box constructed 1916 behind the Up end of the platform is no longer extant. A timber and gable roofed ex-goods shed on the Down side of the track beyond the Down end of the platform was extant in 2001 but is no longer extant. The line was electrified in 1991. Plans show alterations to the station building . The platform building was extensively repaired and upgraded in 1997. All platform structures other than the main brick building were removed.

The goods yard contains a brick-faced platform, class 1, 5 tonne iron Philadelphia jib crane (1880s), modern steel framed, corrugated metal sheds (), and a Corrugated metal gabled gangers shed with timber frame (). =Station building and platform (1883)= The Windsor station building is a large face-brick building in what is known as a type 3 second class roadside sign. It is a symmetrically organised central building with two wings attached to either side. The Down side wing is a rectangular larger building while the Up end wing is almost a square building. The central building features a hipped and valley slate roof, two tall brick chimneys with corbelled tops and round hoods, moulded and dentilated eaves, a corrugated iron ogee style veranda along the street side of the central building, and a wide corrugated metal platform awning supported on cast iron columns, exposed rafters and decorative brackets. Wings feature flat roofs obscured behind low parapets and moulded cornices. The building's vertically proportioned fenestration is original with cement rendered lintels resembling segmental stone arch appearance. The building retains much of its internal original elements including moulded plaster cornices, timber skirtings, fireplace (blocked), mini orb ceiling lining in the office and timber joinery. The overall historic character of the interiors are evident despite the changes and refurbishments overtime. The station building is generally in very good condition. Windsor station has a brick faced road side platform with concrete deck and asphalt finish. White aluminium palisade fencing has been erected along the station street boundary and both ends of the platform. Modern platform furniture, bins, light fittings and signage also feature along the platform. =Goods yard= The yard is a large, irregularly shaped site that is fenced and contains remnants of the 19th century Windsor station goods yard. It is an overgrown yard with patches of concrete and asphalt slabs and remnants of rail sidings and anchor points on the ground. Remnants of the former curved brick faced goods platform are evident under the overgrown vegetation and rubble. An original 1880s goods crane fixed on an octagonal concrete base is the only intact extant element of the former goods yard. It is an iron jib crane with a hook dropping from the end of a single rotating arm. The crane is a Class 1, 5 tonne hand crane, No T181. There are three modern steel framed sheds within the goods yard; One is a large corrugated metal sheeted and gabled shed, with two identical metal sheeted small sheds behind it. Located beyond the fenced area of the goods yard, the gangers shed is a timber framed gabled shed with corrugated metal wall and roof sheeting. It features timber floorboards, timber roof trusses, timber sliding loading doors, and wire mesh covered windows. The gangers shed is in poor condition both internally and externally. Only roof sheeting appears to be new fabric and is in good condition. Notable moveable items include: * A Seth Thomas Clock (# 1886), working condition, in the ticket office. * Two timber L-shaped/corner seats in the waiting room. * An enamel station name board with timber frame on the platform side of the station building. * An Ajax brand safe (#1004) in the SM's office. The former goods yard has high archaeological potential due to the extent of remnant rail sidings, anchor points and former goods platform dating to the first railway. The goods yard is in relatively poor condition due to overgrown vegetation and patches of rubble storage. = Modifications and dates = * 1883 - The station was rebuilt with the goods yard including the brick faced platform and Type 1 jib crane. * 15 Jan 1890 - Water column from Mudgee re-erected. * c.1916 - A skillion roof and timber clad signal box constructed behind the Up end of the platform (no longer extant). * 33 July 1939 - Platform extended. * 1943 - Alterations to station buildings and offices completed. * 1945 - Raising platform height; and providing asphalt strip and brick coping. * 28 September 1975 - Hawkesbury Dairy siding removed. * 1997 - The platform building was extensively repaired and upgraded.

The 1883 station building is a fine example of a Victorian second-class station building and is a significant landmark within the historic town centre. The goods yard is of research significance for its potential to yield information on the operational system and layout of the late 19th century goods handling through the remnants of rail sidings, brick faced platform, hand crane and anchor points. However, its integrity has been compromised due to the removal of the majority of its associated structures and its non-operational state. Windsor railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Windsor Station is historically significant as one of the stations built during the major upgrading works along Richmond line in the 1880s, maintaining physical evidence of a station layout including a goods yard dating from the early 1880s. Although buildings other than the main station building have been removed the station together with the hand crane and brick faced platform of the goods yard are important in demonstrating the configuration, styles and elements that were used in the goods handling and transport in the farming district of the Hawkesbury at the time. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Constructed in 1883, the station building is aesthetically significant as a fine example of a Victorian second-class road side station building providing evidence of the prosperity, and social and economic development of the Windsor area. The building is a landmark within the historic town centre. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The goods yard has potential to yield information on the operational system and layout of late 19th century goods handling through the remnants of rail sidings, the brick faced platform, crane and anchor points. The extent of surviving remnant elements warrant brief archaeological investigation. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Windsor Station combined with its associated goods yard is a rare example of an 1880s railway station layout despite being modified and the majority of the structures removed. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Windsor Station is one of three stations (others Richmond and Riverstone) incorporating larger station buildings built on the Richmond line in the 1880s that differ significantly from other smaller and simpler stations on the line. The station building is a fine example of a late nineteenth century second- class station building representing the peak of achievement in station architecture.

In the post-war years, Schenkl worked shifts in the trunk exchange and was the main breadwinner of her family, which included her daughter and her mother. Early life Emilie Schenkl was born in Vienna on 26 December 1910 in an Austrian Catholic family. Paternal granddaughter of a shoemaker and the daughter of a veterinarian, she started primary school late—towards the end of the Great war—on account of her father's reluctance for her to have formal schooling. Her father, moreover, became unhappy with her progress in secondary school and enrolled her in a nunnery for four years. Schenkl decided against becoming a nun and went back to school, finishing when she was 20. The Great Depression had begun in Europe; consequently, for a few years she was unemployed. She was introduced to Bose through a mutual friend, Dr. Mathur, an Indian physician living in Vienna. Since Schenkl could take shorthand and her English and typing skills were good, she was hired by Bose, who was writing his book, The Indian Struggle. They soon fell in love and were married in a secret Hindu ceremony in 1937, but without a Hindu priest, witnesses, or civil record. Bose went back to India and reappeared in Nazi Germany during April 1941-February 1943. Berlin during the war Soon, according to historian Romain Hayes, \\"the (German) Foreign Office procured a luxurious residence for (Bose) along with a butler, cook, gardener, and an SS-chauffeured car. Emilie Schenkl moved in openly with him. The Germans, aware of the nature of the relationship, refrained from any involvement.\\" However, most of the staff in the Special Bureau for India, which had been set up to aid Bose, did not get along with Emilie. In particular Adam von Trott, Alexander Werth and Freda Kretschemer, according to historian Leonard A. Gordon, \\"appear to have disliked her intensely. They believed that she and Bose were not married and that she was using her liaison with Bose to live an especially comfortable life during the hard times of war\\" and that differences were compounded by issues of class. In November 1942, Schenkl gave birth to their daughter. In February 1943, Bose left Schenkl and their baby daughter and boarded a German submarine to travel, via transfer to a Japanese submarine, to Japanese-occupied southeast Asia, where with Japanese support he formed a Provisional Government of Free India and revamped an army, the Indian National Army, whose goal was to gain India's independence militarily with Japanese help. Bose's military effort, however, was unsuccessful. Later life Schenkl and her daughter survived the war. During their nine years of marriage, Schenkl and Bose spent less than three years together, putting strains on Schenkl. In the post-war years, Schenkl worked shifts in the trunk exchange and was the main breadwinner of her family, which included her daughter and her mother. Although some family members from Bose's extended family, including his brother Sarat Chandra Bose, welcomed Schenkl and her daughter and met with her in Austria, Schenkl never visited India. According to her daughter, Schenkl was a very private woman and tight-lipped about her relationship with Bose. Schenkl died in 1996.

The show shared some of the stream-of-consciousness style of Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Chapman was a member. Actors included Mark Wing-Davey and Simon Jones. The concept of the show was, according to Chapman, to follow the exploits of two modern-day linguists who would travel around a Britain gripped in rapid decline. The linguists would comment upon the origins of a word or phrase, which would then be the genesis of a sketch. Although two scripts were written (the second a collaboration between Chapman and David Yallop), only one episode was ever filmed. It was broadcast only once by the BBC, with little promotion, at 10pm on Saturday 10 January 1976 opposite Match of the Day, and so was seen by relatively few people. The videotape recording of the show has since been wiped, as used to be common for archived BBC shows, due to the relatively high cost of videotape at the time. The film segments shot in outdoor locations survive, and consist of a sketch titled \\"Severance of a Peony\\", and some inserts intended for an item about Genghis Khan. The former was included on the DVD for Adams's 1981 TV series adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and also appeared, rewritten as an anecdote, in Chapman's book A Liar's Autobiography. Rewrites of the Genghis Khan sketch appear in some editions of Adams's posthumously published work The Salmon of Doubt as the short story \\"The Private Life of Genghis Khan\\". It was reported in 2005, by a representative posting on the forum at the archive television website The Mausoleum Club, that a videotape made by Chapman on an obsolete format had been given to the National Film Television and Videotape Archive. It was restored, a process which took 2 years and shown at the National Film Theatre on Saturday, 2 December 2006 as part of the Missing Believed Wiped event. It was shown again on 24 September 2019 as part of the BFI commemoration of fifty years of Python.

In April 2005, on her third trip to Bali, Lawrence was arrested at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar with of heroin concealed on her body. After a criminal trial in which she cooperated with investigators and informed on the ringleaders, she was sentenced on 13 February 2006 to life imprisonment. Her appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court to have the life sentence reduced to 20 years was successful on 26 April 2006. Lawrence was moved from Kerobokan Prison in late 2013 to a prison in Negara, Bali after authorities accused her of a plot to kill prison guards. At her own request in March 2014, Lawrence was subsequently transferred to a prison in Bangli to be closer to Denpasar for her family and visitors. When given a five-month remission of sentence on Indonesia's Independence Day in 2009, her sentence was commuted in 2018. She was released and deported on 21 November 2018. Background Lawrence, from Newcastle, New South Wales, lived for a decade with her same sex partner, who was ten years her senior. After this relationship ended in October 2004, Lawrence moved back in with her mother and stepfather. Her biological father described Lawrence, who was 27 at the time of her arrest, as being naïve and unworldly. Initially employed as a trainee panel beater with a smash repair company, Lawrence later gained employment at Eurest, a catering company, where she met Martin Stephens, Matthew Norman, and her supervisor, Andrew Chan. All four were later convicted of drug trafficking as members of the Bali Nine. Alleged trafficking conspiracy Media reports claim that in early October 2004 Lawrence was invited to Chan's Enfield (Sydney) home to celebrate her 27th birthday. Chan allegedly told her that she was to travel with him to Bali without being told the detail behind the mission. Lawrence claimed that Chan would cover all flights and accommodation. However, if she disobeyed him or disclosed the nature of their arrangement, he would harm her family. Conversely, Lawrence would be rewarded for following instructions. It was also reported that she met Myuran Sukumaran around this time. On 16 October 2004, Lawrence flew to Bali on what Indonesian police claim was a false passport. It was alleged that Chan entered Bali on the same date. Lawrence claimed that she was in regular contact with Chan whilst she stayed in the Istana Rama Hotel in Kuta, and Chan in Kuta's sprawling Hard Rock complex. Media reports stated that Lawrence alleged that on 22 October 2004, Sukumaran strapped packages to the body of both Lawrence and Chan, and with Chan's girlfriend, Grace, boarded a commercial flight to Australia, successfully clearing security, customs and immigration in both Indonesia and Australia. Lawrence claimed that she and Chan were met at the airport, the packages removed, all of them taken to another house, and then Lawrence went home. A few days later Lawrence claimed that Chan handed her an envelope with A$10,000 cash. A similar trip was organised following Chan's orders, Lawrence claimed, where she departed Australia on 5 December 2004. Lawrence claimed that seven others were involved, including Chan, Matthew Norman, and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen (going by the alias of David). Lawrence claim that she was again given cash to purchase flights and accommodation for eight days, staying again at the Istana Rama in Kuta. However, the second delivery was aborted when heroin suppliers failed to deliver \\"due to a financial matter or someone knowing about the plan the shipment was cancelled\\". According to Lawrence, again under Chan's instructions, Lawrence departed Australia on 6 April 2005. The day before, Lawrence, Stephens and Si Yi Chen met with Sukumaran where police allege drug smuggling tools such as sealable plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were stuffed into the bags of Lawrence and Stephens. Lawrence claims she was given cash; whilst Stephens claims that his life was threatened. Media reports claim that police records show that Lawrence was in daily contact with Chan, whilst in Bali, until 13 April, when Chan changed his mobile phone number. On the same day, he instructed Lawrence and other members of the Bali Nine to change hotels. The original planned departure date of 14 April from Bali was delayed as Chan suspected Australian and Indonesian police were aware of his plans. =Arrest in Indonesia= Lawrence was arrested by Indonesian police on 17 April 2005 at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali. Heroin weighing was discovered strapped to her legs and chest, concealed underneath her clothing. Scott Rush, Michael Czugaj and Stephens were arrested at the same time as Lawrence. On 20 April 2005, graphic footage of the arrests and subsequent police questioning of Lawrence and other members of the Bali Nine was aired on Australian television. On the same day that Lawrence was arrested, Indonesian police also arrested Chen, Nguyen, Sukumaran and Norman at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta. Alleged co-ringleader, Chan was also arrested the same day whilst seated on an Australian Airlines flight waiting to depart Denpasar for Sydney. At the time Chan was arrested, he was carrying three mobile phones and a boarding pass. No drugs were found in his possession. On her arrest, Lawrence accused Chan of threatening her life if she did not continue with the plan to import drugs. Lawrence also claimed, but later retracted her statement that Chan had offered her A$15,000 if she followed his instructions. Lawrence also rejected police allegations that she travelled to Bali previously on a false passport. = Criticism of Australian Federal Police tipoff = Lee Rush, the father of Scott Rush (a fellow member of the Bali Nine) said that he contacted the Australian Federal Police (AFP) prior to the commission of the offence, fearing his son was travelling to Bali and would commit a drug-related crime. Rush senior claims then to have received assurances from the AFP that they would tell his son he was under surveillance to dissuade him from going through with the crime before the group's departure from Indonesia. Scott Rush's lawyers said he was never contacted. It was revealed that the AFP alerted Indonesian police that a crime was to be committed approximately two weeks before the arrests, and had commenced an investigation about ten weeks prior to the arrests. When the Bali Nine were arrested, the news of the tipoff became public and there was criticism of the role of the AFP in protecting the interests of Australian citizens. Commenting on the matter at the time, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty was reported as saying: Rush took action in the Federal Court of Australia against the AFP for breach of the bilateral treaty between Indonesia and Australia when information was handed by the AFP to the Indonesians. Rush's case claimed that such information should only be released by the Attorney-General. However, the Commonwealth Government maintained that the treaty only applies after a suspect is charged. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court in January 2006. Criminal trial In December 2005, as the trials began, it was reported that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called for Australia not to intervene in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment. Lawyers acting for Stephens, one of the Bali Nine, claimed the fairness of his trial was in jeopardy following comments made in the media by Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda that Australians should be prepared for members of the Bali Nine to receive a death sentence, if found guilty. Czugaj and Rush, both since convicted members of the Bali Nine and school friends from Brisbane, testified that they had never met Lawrence or Stephens until they were all arrested together at Ngurah Rai Airport. Rush also testified against Lawrence at her trial; whilst Lawrence testified against both Rush and Chan. Meanwhile, in a counter-claim, Chan alleged that it was Lawrence who was the ringleader. Chan claimed that Lawrence had given him Rp1 million to take suitcases with heroin to the Melasti Hotel. It was reported that the indictment claimed that Lawrence was a drug mule who was recruited in Sydney, was paid for her return flight and accommodation to Bali by members of the conspiracy and then had of heroin strapped to her body by Chan, Sukumaran and another of the group. Central to Lawrence's defence was her fear of Chan and the alleged retributions Chan, her former manager at Eurest, was planning to take on her family if she and others did not follow Chan's orders. Lawrence admitted to her role in attempting to smuggle the drugs to Australia, saying before the Denpasar District Court on 8 January 2006: =Sentencing and appeal= In spite of widespread media reports that Lawrence had been cooperative with police, the Indonesian judges found no evidence of Lawrence claims her life was threatened. Judge I Gusti Ngurah Astawa said during sentencing: In what was an apparent shock for Lawrence and her defence team, she was sentenced on 13 February 2006 to life imprisonment, together with Rush. Commenting on the sentences at the time, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Keelty stated: The Australian Prime Minister John Howard was reported as commenting: As verdicts and sentences were handed down in the trials of the Bali Nine, additional arrests were made in Australia. Prison life In 2005, Lawrence reportedly attempted suicide twice in prison and also suffered a broken arm due to a self harm incident. These incidents occurred after learning that Andrew Chan was to be moved to the same prison. In June 2006, Lawrence claimed she had a Balinese girlfriend with whom she shared a prison cell. Lawrence and Schapelle Corby, both serving time for drug trafficking in Kerobokan Prison, developed a close but at times fraught relationship. In an interview with Woman's Day magazine, Lawrence said she was appointed to care for Corby and had watched Corby's mental stability deteriorate. Commutation Lawrence appealed the sentence to the Indonesian Supreme Court. On 26 April 2006, a sentence of 20 years imprisonment was handed down. In November 2018 her sentence was commuted, and she was released and deported to Australia on 21 November 2018. Return to Australia Upon return to Australia in November 2018, Lawrence handed herself in to NSW Police pursuant to outstanding warrants for car theft, driving unlicensed, exceeding the speed limit by 40 km/h and failing to stop for police on 26 March 2005. Lawrence was due to appear on 26 April 2005 in the Gosford Magistrates Court. However, due to her arrest in Indonesia nine days earlier, she failed to appear. In November 2018, Lawrence was released on bail for subsequent hearing in Newcastle Local Court on 6 December 2018. The case was then adjourned until 17 January 2019, at which time Lawrence's lawyer entered a guilty plea for sentencing on 1 February 2019, and was given a $1,000.00 fine with a twelve- month Community Corrections Order.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-05/renae-lawrence-car-chase- sentence/10780292 References Category:1977 births Category:Australian drug traffickers Category:Australian people imprisoned abroad Category:Lesbians Category:LGBT people from Australia Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:People from Newcastle, New South Wales Category:Prisoners and detainees of Indonesia Bali Nine Bali Nine Category:21st-century Australian criminals Category:Female organized crime figures ","title":"Renae Lawrence"},{"id":"1970014","text":"Abdelkader Hachani (; ; 26 December 1956 – 22 November 1999) was a leading figure and founding member of the Islamic Salvation Front (or FIS), an Algerian Islamic party.

Hachani was shot by an assassin in the waiting room of a dental clinic in the Bab El Oued district of Algiers on 22 November 1999, and subsequently died in hospital. In December, the government announced that it had arrested Fouad Boulemia, a GIA member, for the murder; Boulemia was convicted in a controversial trial, sentenced to death, and then released. Hachani was trained as a petrochemical engineer. Within FIS, he was considered a member of the Djaz'ara (Algerianist) wing. He left four children behind.

Proportion is a central principle of architectural theory and an important connection between mathematics and art. It is the visual effect of the relationships of the various objects and spaces that make up a structure to one another and to the whole. These relationships are often governed by multiples of a standard unit of length known as a \\"module\\".James Stevens Curl (ed.), Oxford Dictionary of Architecture, 2nd ed. (Oxford, 2006), 606-607. Proportion in architecture was discussed by Vitruvius, Leon Battista Alberti, Andrea Palladio, and Le Corbusier among others.  Roman architecture  = Vitruvius = The Vitruvian Man developed by Leonardo da Vinci based on the description of Vitruvius' ideal ratio of the human body. Commemorative coin illustrating Le Corbusier's Modulor Architecture in Roman antiquity was rarely documented except in the writings of Vitruvius' treatise De architectura. Vitruvius served as an engineer under Julius Caesar during the first Gallic Wars (58–50 BC). The treatise was dedicated to Emperor Augustus. As Vitruvius defined the concept in the first chapters of the treatise, he mentioned the three prerequisites of architecture are firmness (firmitas), commodity (utilitas), and delight (venustas), which require the architects to be equipped with a varied kind of learning and knowledge of many branches. Moreover, Vitruvius identified the \\"Six Principles of Design\\" as order (ordinatio), arrangement (dispositio), proportion (eurythmia), symmetry (symmetria), propriety (decor) and economy (distributio). Among the six principles, proportion interrelates and supports all the other factors in geometrical forms and arithmetical ratios. The word symmetria, usually translated to \\"symmetry\\" in modern renderings, in ancient times meant something more closely related to \\"mathematical harmony\\" and measurable proportions. Vitruvius tried to describe his theory in the makeup of the human body, which he referred to as the perfect or golden ratio. The principles of measurement units digit, foot, and cubit also came from the dimensions of a Vitruvian Man. More specifically, Vitruvius used the total height of 6 feet of a person, and each part of the body takes up a different ratio. For example, the face is about 1/10 of the total height, and the head is about 1/8 of the total height. Vitruvius used these ratios to prove that the composition of classical orders mimicked the human body, thereby ensuring aesthetic harmonization when people viewed architectural columns. Classical architecture In classical architecture, the module was established as the radius of the lower shaft of a classical column, with proportions expressed as a fraction or multiple of that module.James Stevens Curl (ed.), Oxford Dictionary of Architecture, 2nd ed. (Oxford, 2006), 496. Le Corbusier In his Le Modulor (1948), Le Corbusier presented a system of proportions which took the golden ratio and a man with a raised arm as the scalable modules of proportion.

Revivals In 1970, rock musician Ringo Starr surprised the public by releasing an album of Songbook songs from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, Sentimental Journey. Reviews were mostly poor or even disdainful, but the album reached #22 on the US charts and #7 in Britain, with sales of 500,000. Other pop singers who established themselves in the 1960s or later followed with albums reviving songs from the Great American Songbook, beginning with Harry Nilsson in 1973 and continuing into the 21st century. Linda Ronstadt, Rod Stewart, and Bob Dylan made several such albums.

She is the 1997 U.S. national all-around champion, the 1998 Goodwill Games gold medalist on the floor exercise and vault, a four-time national champion in the individual events of vault, balance beam, and floor exercise, and a five-time World Cup champion. She is also the 1996 junior national all- around and floor champion. At the 1999 American Cup, Atler became the first female gymnast to successfully perform a Rudi vault. A member of the U.S. national gymnastics team from the age of 12, Atler was one of America's most successful and talented gymnasts in the late 1990s. Known for her explosive vaults, difficult tumbling skills and charismatic personality, she won or medaled in several important meets, and was considered to be one of the front- runners for the 2000 Olympics. However, injuries, coaching conflicts, gym changes, mental breakdowns and bulimia symptoms derailed her progress in 1999 and 2000, and after a poor showing at the 2000 Olympic Trials, she was controversially left off the Olympic team despite placing sixth overall. Early career Atler was born on February 17, 1982 in Valencia, California, and began gymnastics at age 5. She has a brother who played baseball, her mother was a tennis instructor, and one of her cousins had been a Minnesota Vikings quarterback. At age 11, she began training at Charter Oak Gliders in Covina, California, and was coached by Beth Kline-Rybacki and Steve Rybacki. By the time she was 12 years old, she was competing at the elite level. Official biography at USA Gymnastics =1995 season= As a junior elite gymnast, Atler had a fruitful career. In 1995, she gained attention by placing third in the all-around, behind Olympian Kerri Strug and Heather Brink, at the U.S. Olympic Festival. She also won a gold medal on beam and a silver medal on floor. She went on to win the silver medal in the all-around at that year's U.S. National Championships. Atler also made her international competitive debut in 1995, winning the floor exercise title at the prestigious International Junior Gymnastics Competition in Japan.\\"Getting to know Vanessa Atler\\" USA Gymnastics, June 3, 1996 =1996 season: Junior National Champion= In February, Atler won the junior all-around title at the American Classic. In June at the U.S. National Championships, she became the junior national champion in the all-around and the floor exercise. She was invited to participate in a televised exhibition meet, USA vs. the World, with members of the Magnificent Seven and international Olympians.USA vs. the World results USA Gymnastics, September 2, 1996 With her February 1982 birth date, Atler missed the age cutoff for senior competition—which would have given her a chance to compete for a spot on the 1996 Olympic team—by only six weeks. In 1997, she found herself shut out of senior international competition once again, as the FIG raised the age limit from fifteen to sixteen.\\"Vanessa Atler: World class gymnast\\" Mary Schubert, Associated Press/Daily News 1998 =1997 season: Senior National Champion= Atler competed well in 1997, participating in both junior events and senior meets that were not bound by the FIG's new age restrictions. She placed second all-around at the 1997 American Cup and won event titles on vault and beam. In August at the 1997 U.S. National Championships, she won the national all-around title in a tie with Kristy Powell. At that same competition, she also won the vault title and the bronze medal on uneven bars. She went on to win the all-around title at the 1997 Canberra Cup in Australia, an important meet for junior international gymnasts.\\"Atler at peace with herself\\" Canoe Network, September 15, 2000 During that same year, Atler began to experience problems on the uneven bars. On the second day of U.S. Nationals, a fall from bars kept her from winning the all-around title outright. This marked the beginning of a string of competitions in which she suffered unusual mistakes and misses on bars. In her online diary, she once referred to the bars as \\"the deviltesting my will and my patience, even my love for the sport.\\"Reported at NBC-TV broadcast of 1998 American Cup Over the next few years, bars would become a mental block for the young athlete who regularly struggled to put together a mistake-free routine in the heat of competition. Atler's main issue on bars involved a release move called a Comaneci salto, which she fell on at three consecutive National Championships from 1997-1999. This led to persistent questioning as to whether the Comaneci should have been removed from her bar routine despite the fact that she did complete the skill successfully on occasion.\\"Whose star will shine in Sydney?\\" John Wilner, Daily News 1998\\"Decidedly different: Atler's path not routine\\" Bob Duffy, Boston Globe August 14, 2000 Senior international career =1998 season: 2-time Goodwill Games Champion= In 1998, Atler was finally age-eligible for major senior international competition. In March at the American Cup, a fall from bars cost her the all- around title and she placed fourth all-around. In event finals at the same competition, she won the vault title and placed third on bars with a hit routine. In July at the 1998 Goodwill Games, Atler was chosen to compete on floor exercise and vault, her two strongest apparatus. She won the gold medal on both events, defeating a field of Olympic and World medalists. In August at the 1998 U.S. National Championships, she won the all-around silver medal, as well as the gold medal on floor and the silver medal on vault. A disastrous 8.225 on bars during the first night of competition cost her a chance to defend her all-around title, but she rebounded well on the second day and received a 9.8 for her hit bar routine. In November, Atler won the Australia Cup all-around title with a strong performance on every event. She also won the vault and floor titleshttps://usagym.org/pages/post.html?PostID=1373. In December, she continued to gain momentum at the 1998 Copa Gimnastica competition in Mexico City, where she once again delivered strong routines on all four events and won the all-around bronze medal in a deep field behind Viktoria Karpenko and Simona Amânar. She also won the gold medal on vault, defeating Amanar, just as she had done at the Goodwill Games. =1999 season= Atler began her 1999 season in February with a strong showing at the American Classic, where she won the all-around title by a large margin with top quality routines on every apparatus. In March at the American Cup, she became the first American woman to successfully complete a Rudi vault in competition. She won the event title on that event, as well as the beam and floor titles. Despite falling off bars in Preliminaries, she placed first all- around in that round of competition. During Finals, her routines were extremely strong on three events, but she fell off bars once again, which cost her the title and dropped her to third all-around.vanessa Atler - Vingette - 1999 Visa American Cup NBC Sports,1999. Shortly thereafter, at the Paris-Bercy competition in France, Atler won the silver medal in a strong all-around field behind Svetlana Khorkina and also won the vault gold medal. During the floor exercise event final, she severely injured her ankle when she landed her double layout-punch front opening tumbling pass out-of-bounds. The out-of- bounds area of this particular floor mat lacked the proper spring and safety protection required. Atler recovered in time to compete at the 1999 U.S. National Championships, where she won the silver medal in the all-around behind Kristen Maloney. She was leading the competition going into the final rotation, but a fall from bars cost her the title. She went on to win the gold medal on vault and beam in Event Finals. Following the U.S. National Championships, Atler left her longtime coaches at Charter Oak gymnastics club, Steve and Beth Rybacki. She was coached by Artur Akopyan at a local California gym as she prepared to compete at the U.S. World Team Trials and World Championships.1999 Worlds AA Part 7 Eurosport UK,1999 She was, however, too injured to compete at the World Team Trials, and was petitioned onto the team based on the strength of her scores at 1999 Nationals, alongside Kristen Maloney and Jennie Thompson who were also suffering from injuries. In October at the 1999 World Championships in Tianjin, China, Atler was out of competitive shape and unprepared for the competition, but she still did well enough to qualify to the All-Around Final in 7th place, the top U.S. qualifier. She also qualified for the Floor Final and was to replace Kristen Maloney (who pulled out of the final due to an injury) in the Beam Final.Women's Event Qualifiers To FinalsUSA Gymnastics,October 11, 1999 In the Team Final, she had some uncharacteristic errors and scored an 8.025 on beam after counting two falls. Struggling with her ankle injury that was progressively getting worse, she placed 31st in the all-around after ending her floor routine with a basic layout tumbling pass. She then withdrew from both of her event finals.Maloney and Atler Withdraw From Event FinalsUSA Gymnastics,October 16, 1999 After the 1999 World Championships, Atler had two surgeries to repair the injured ankle that had plagued her throughout most of 1999. During that same time, she moved from California to Texas to train with 1988 Olympic champion Valeri Liukin at the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy (WOGA). =2000 season= In 2000 after her injury layoff, Atler returned to form in July at the U.S. Classic, where she won the all-around title.https://www.usagym.org/pages/post.html?PostID=1336 Later that month at the 2000 U.S. National Championships, she finished fourth in the all-around, a respectable finish after a lengthy injury recovery, which set her up well for an Olympic berth. She also won the silver medal on vault and the bronze medal on floor.\\"Atler's back\\" International Gymnast July 22, 2000 At the 2000 Olympic Trials a few weeks later, Atler experienced what many considered a meltdown. She was unable to hit even one solid routine over the two days of competition, and botched moves that she usually performed well, changing her second vault in mid-air during both days, modifying her second tumbling pass on floor during the first day, and falling on her back on her beam dismount during the first day. As a result, the Olympic Selection Committee opted to leave her completely off the U.S. Olympic Team.\\"Being Good Isn't Always Enough for U.S. Team\\" Juliet Macur, New York Times June 24, 2004\\"Female Gymnasts Braved an Audition, and a Trial\\" George Vecsey, New York Times August 21, 2000\\"Miller Out, But Dawes And Chow Make Team\\" Selena Roberts, New York Times August 21, 2000 However, even with several significant mistakes, Atler managed to place sixth at Trials and was still widely regarded as one of the United States's best gymnasts, causing some to argue that she had earned a spot on the team and to question the fairness of the selection process. Six athletes were named to the team as well as two alternates. After 2000 Atler participated in the T.J.

Gun trucks typically have Improvised vehicle armor, such as scrap metal, concrete, gravel, or sandbags, which is added to a heavy truck. World War II Quadmount on the back of a CCKW. Note the loading ramps on both sides of the truck. When the prospect of a German invasion of the United Kingdom seemed likely, the British Army designed and built an improvised armored vehicle, the Bedford OXA. It was based on the one and a half-ton OXD truck and was upgraded with armor plate, and armed with a .55 in anti-tank rifle and a Bren gun. Slightly less than a thousand were built by 1941, and they were employed by the British Home Guard. Other British examples from the invasion-scare period were the Armadillo armoured fighting vehicle and the Bison concrete armoured lorries. Both were conventional trucks fitted with improvised armour, in the case of the Bison, a concrete fighting-compartment was carried, essentially making a mobile pillbox. The Armadillo used two walls of wood, with the space between filled with gravel. Both vehicles had poor mobility and were employed for airfield defense by the Royal Air Force. In the event of a surprise, airborne attack, Bisons would deploy a short distance from the key points of the airfield and probably fight from static positions, positions where fixed defenses often could not be constructed as they would impede aircraft movement during day–to–day operations. The Armadillo's mobility, while poor, was better than the Bison's and it was intended they would take on a mobile role similar to a conventional armoured vehicle.The National Archives: AIR 2/7212 Armadillos: improved fighting vehicles for airfield defence  Vietnam War  During the Vietnam War, it was the mission of the US Army Transportation Corps to ferry supplies from the coastal ports of Qui Nhon and Cam Ranh Bay to inland bases located at Bong Son, An Khe, Pleiku, Da Lat, and Buon Ma Thuot. The logistical requirements of the MACV were huge, and 200-truck convoys were not uncommon. These formations were tempting targets for Viet Cong guerrilla groups, who often sprung ambushes in remote areas. One unit that often fell victim to such attacks was the 8th Transportation Group, based in Qui Nhon. Two dangerous stretches of Route 19 between Qui Nhon and Pleiku became the enemy's favorite kill zones, the \\"Devil's Hairpin\\" in An Khe Pass and \\"Ambush Alley\\" below Mang Giang Pass as incidents occurred there on an almost daily basis. Providing security for convoys proved virtually impossible, as the Military Police units whose task it was did not have the manpower or equipment to secure the whole highway. Other military combat units only controlled the stretch of road within their designated checkpoints and could serve as a reaction force; so for much of the way, it fell onto the transport units to provide themselves immediate security. At first, they did this with armed jeeps, but these rapidly proved inadequate in the face of improved Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army weaponry and tactics. Eve of Destruction in the Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis On September 2, 1967, a particularly devastating attack killed seven drivers, wounded 17 and destroyed or damaged 30 trucks. To remedy the obvious vulnerability of the supply convoys, a \\"hardened convoy\\" concept was implemented, protected by a new type of security vehicle. This gun truck, as it became known, was based on the two-and-a-half- ton cargo truck, protected by a barrier of sandbags, and armed with two M60 machine guns. Hardened convoys were smaller than previously, being composed of only 100 trucks, and their security detail was increased until there was one gun truck for every 10 transport trucks. In the event of an ambush, their role was to drive into the kill zone during the first few minutes of the attack, and saturate the attackers with their firepower. Early designs proved flawed, as the sandbag protections quickly became waterlogged in the frequent rains, weighing down the whole vehicle. They were later replaced with ad hoc steel armor plating, salvaged from scrap yards. The crew consisted of a driver, two gunners, a non-commissioned officer in charge (NCOIC), and sometimes a grenadier armed with an M79 grenade launcher. In October 1968, the factory- made hardening kits arrived to replace the sandbag and wood gun trucks.Richard E. Killblane, Circle the Wagons; The History of US Convoy Security, Combat Studies Institute, 2006 On November 24, 1967, during an engagement in \\"Ambush Alley\\", a group of gun trucks managed to thwart an ambush. The convoy lost six transport trucks and four gun trucks damaged or destroyed, and several drivers were killed and wounded, but the Viet Cong lost 41 KIA and were forced to withdraw. This was the first ambush against gun trucks. Despite the increased security, transportation units still came under attack, forcing the gun truck units to improve the design of their vehicles. The two-and-a-half-ton trucks were underpowered, and the addition of armor and weapons slowed them down, leading to their replacement by five-ton cargo trucks that formed the basis for larger gun trucks. The improvised nature of these vehicles meant they varied considerably in appearance. They were given colourful nicknames such as \\"Deuce is Wild,\\" \\"Cold Sweat\\",\\" \\"Iron Butterfly\\" or \\"Pandemonium\\" that were often painted on the sides in large letters. Their armament consisted of various combinations of weapons including M60s, .50-calibre machine guns, and XM 134 miniguns. Anti-aircraft weapons such as the quadmount .50 cal. machine guns were also used until 1969 when the truck companies had three to six gun trucks each.Richard E. Killblane, Convoy Ambush Case Studies Vol. I, Korea and Vietnam, US Army Transportation School, 2014 Eve of Destruction from above. The gun truck design evolved with a four-sided gun box bolted on the outside of the truck bed, then an inner steel wall was added, with a space between each layer, to provide protection against anti-tank rockets. Because of the shortage of steel kits, the M113 armoured personnel carrier hulls were mounted on the bed of a five-ton truck, thus providing all-round protection for the crew. The last design of gun box had the steel wall mounted inside the bed of the truck instead of outside.Killblane, Convoy Ambush Case Studies Vol. I Despite their aggressive names, gun trucks were strictly defensive weapons, being used only for convoy escort and perimeter defense duties. Gun trucks suffered from several drawbacks. The added weight of armour, weapons and ammunition increased fuel consumption, as well as creating maintenance problems and reducing the durability of the truck frames. Also, the personnel assigned as crew to the security vehicles were no longer available for transport duties, thus reducing the lift capacity of each unit. Despite this, they were generally regarded as a success. In all, an estimated 300 to 400 trucks were transformed in this way. Senior officers saw the 5-ton gun truck as a temporary solution until enough V-100 armored cars arrived. However, by 1970 it became obvious to all - except the Military Police - that the V-100 was a death trap if the armor was penetrated. Furthermore, the V-100 had problems with its power train. So the gun trucks continued to serve until the last American truck company was inactivated in Vietnam in 1972. With the end of the Vietnam War, the need for such vehicles disappeared and most were either scrapped or returned to cargo carrying. One truck, an M54 named by its crew \\"Eve of Destruction,\\" was brought back intact and is on display at the Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis, Virginia.  Iraq War  IED in Iraq. All the crew members survived. An M1114 gun truck (250th TC/1-34BCT) on mission in Nasiriyah, Iraq During the Iraq War, the vulnerability of American supply convoys became apparent as soon as March 2003, when a maintenance unit was ambushed in Nasiriyah, with eleven soldiers killed and five taken prisoner, including Pfc. Jessica Lynch. Not until June 2003 during the post-invasion phase of the war, did the Iraqi insurgents begin attacking convoys with regularity, which led to the re-invention of the gun truck. The truck units initially used sandbags and plywood as outlined in FM 55-30, but experienced the same problems as encountered in Vietnam. By definition a gun truck was any wheeled vehicle with a crew-served weapon regardless of whether it had any armor or not. Initially, the truck drivers mounted armor and machineguns on any and every wheeled vehicle in their inventory but settled on two primary platforms, the M939 five-ton truck and the HMMWV. The Palletized Load Systems were also converted to gun trucks because fully loaded with cargo they could not keep up with the other trucks. The minimum requirement for gun truck escort was two gun trucks and each unit experimented with different gun truck designs and procedures.Killblane, Circle the Wagons On April 5, 2004, the cleric Muqtadā al-Ṣadr called for a jihad against coalition forces and beginning on Thursday night, April 8, his Mahdi Militia destroyed eight bridges and overpasses around the Convoy Support Center Scania, thus severing the supply line from the south, and then began large scale ambushes. Up until that night, the ambushes involved no more than seven ambushers with kill zones no larger than 100 meters. The next day the Militia ambushed any convoy heading into or out of Baghdad International Airport with kill zones several hundred meters long. The worst ambush killed eight KBR drivers and three US Army drivers of the 724th Transportation Company. Matt Maupin was listed as the only American soldier missing in action for several years until his body was finally discovered. After that, Brigadier General James Chambers, Commander of the 13th Corps Support Command, standardized the ratio of gun trucks per convoy and convoys should not exceed 30 vehicles.Richard E. Killblane, Road Warriors, unpublished In April 2004, Leaders of the US Army Reserve 375th Transportation Group and the 812th Transportation Battalion formed a special provisional unit - the 518th Transportation Company called \\"Gun Truck\\" Company. Based in Camp Navistar (located on the Kuwait side of the border Near Safwan, Iraq), this company acquired 35 humvees and five M939 five-ton trucks, and modified them with improvised armor and .50 calibre machine-guns. With many Reserve and National Guard combat arms units already converting and performing Convoy Security Escort service while deployed to Iraq, the need for a special Gun Truck unit proved unfeasible and the unit disbanded in April, 2005. The use of improvised fighting vehicles, protected by the so-called \\"Hillbilly armor\\", quickly became a political issue, with the Bush administration coming under criticism for having sent the U.S. military to fight without adequate equipment.\\"Meehan Calls for Ramped Up Armoring of Vehicles,\\" Congressman Martin T. Meehan (MA05), news release, December 10, 2004. The idea of producing a standardised gun truck was instigated by Representative Duncan Hunter (R.-Calif.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, despite the reluctance of some Army superior officers. Developed with the help of Vietnam veterans by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the resulting armored box (dubbed the \\"Hunter box\\") was intended for use on five-ton trucks. Their armor protection was composed of high-grade steel plating, fiberglass and ballistic glass, while the armament consisted of two to four heavy machine-guns. The first prototype was completed in March 2004, and shipped to Iraq in July 2004, after which production began at a slow rate, with 35 units in service by July 2005. As of September 2007, a total of 100 kits had been produced for Iraq, and 18 for use in Afghanistan. The \\"Hunter boxes\\" apparently proved popular with U.S. troops, but were criticized by senior officers for their lack of overhead protection, and for being top- heavy. However, few cases exist to prove their doubts in this equipment. Fully armored M1114s and factory-built add-on-armor kits for the Humvee gun truck were arriving in quantity by the end of 2004, and the cab armor kits for fleet of 5-ton trucks, M915 tractors and Heavy Equipment Transport Systems began arriving the next year. Priority of the M1114s went to Iraq-based escort units while the Kuwait-based truck companies that had to drive all across Iraq received the add-on-armor kits until more M1114s arrived. The soldiers appreciated the much needed armored protection but the extra weight of the add-on-armor kits reduced the Humvee's acceleration and speed substantially. The suspension and power train wore out quickly. The modified heavier vehicle's sluggishness could not match the maneuverability of the insurgent's vehicles. By the Palm Sunday Ambush on March 20, 2005, all vehicles on the road had some form of armor whether improvised or factory built. After suffering high losses during this ambush, with no Americans killed, the insurgents turned to IEDs as their primary weapon of choice.Killblane, Road Warriors The appearance of the explosively formed projectile required additional fragmentary armor added to the M1114s, which over-taxed their power trains and suspension systems. The improved M1151 Up-armored HMMWV became the escort platform of choice along with the 5-ton gun trucks until the MRAPs began replacing them in 2008. The Heavy Equipment Transporter proved to be the most survivable vehicle on the road because of its height, so Kuwait-based units began sending them out ahead of the convoy looking for IEDs. The Army Transportation Museum preserved several examples of Iraq and Afghanistan gun trucks. It has a Hill Billy armor 5-ton gun truck from Iraq, HMMWV with prototype add-on-armor kit, M1114 that survived an IED blast in Afghanistan, a LLNL 5-ton gun truck \\"Ace of Spades\\" from Iraq, two MRAPs, a M915 and Heavy Equipment Transporter with cab armor kits from Iraq, and a \\"Frankenstein\\" cab armor kit for the M939 5-ton truck. The Airman Heritage Museum also preserved a Hill Billy armor 5-ton gun truck from Iraq. The 1st Cavalry Museum brought back the last MRAP of the last convoy to cross the border from Iraq.  Colombia  Colombian Army have several guns trucks based con M35 2-1/2 ton cargo truck, locally named as \\"Meteoro\\", are trucks with indigenous armour and two M2 heavy machine guns. Other models of trucks are modified to similar specification. These gun trucks are used for convoy protection and checkpoints against the guerrillas. Similar vehicles Improvised armoured truck, during the Easter Rising * During the Easter Rising in 1916, the British Army used a truck fitted with an armoured body. This was constructed from the smokeboxes of several steam locomotives. Gun-slits were cut in the body to allow troops to fire out. Painted black, dummy gun-slits were also applied to confuse snipers. * During the Soviet–Afghan War, Soviet convoys were frequently ambushed by Afghan mujahideen guerillas. The rebel groups often sited their ambush parties on surrounding heights, above the maximum elevation of the main weapons of the tanks and APCs employed as convoy escorts. As a stop-gap solution to this problem, the Soviets fitted twin-barrelled 23 mm ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns onto Kamaz trucks, with tents to camouflage the armaments. These vehicles possessed extreme firepower, but they lacked armour, and the crew were exposed to machine-gun and small-arms fire.

Georg Eduard Goltermann (19 August 1824 - 29 December 1898) was a German cellist, composer and conductor. Life Goltermann was born in Hannover. His father was an organist, and therefore he got an early introduction to music. He received cello lessons from in München, the most important Bavarian cello virtuoso of his time. He took composition lessons from Ignaz Lachner. He also learned to conduct. In 1852, after briefly touring Europe as a solo cellist, he became music director in Würzburg. In 1853 he accepted an offer to become deputy music director of the municipal theater Stadttheater in Frankfurt am Main, where he was promoted to Kapellmeister (principal music director) in 1874. He died in Frankfurt am Main. Works Some of Goltermann's works were very popular at the time and are still used for teaching purposes. Goltermann composed eight cello concertos, of which the fourth is the most famous. This \\"student's concerto\\" is the easiest of his first five concertos, and it is studied fairly widely. His music is rarely performed in professional concerts. It is deemed to lack the musicality of true concertos, and though it has been praised for its melodious and pleasant nature, it is not considered inspired. Instead his concertos are studied by students to learn technique and get a basic understanding of concerto style. Concerto No. 1 has maintained a presence in today’s standard repertoire. The slow movement entitled Cantilena was often played separately as a cello solo. An early recording of this movement played by Pablo Casals exists. * Concerto No. 1 in A minor for cello and piano, Op. 14 * Concerto No. 2 in D minor for cello and piano, Op. 30 * Concerto No. 3 in B minor for cello and piano, Op. 51 * Concerto No. 4 in G major for cello and piano, Op. 65 * Concerto No. 5 in D minor for cello and piano, Op. 76 * Concerto No. 6 in D major for cello and piano, Op. 100 * Concerto No. 7 in C major for cello and piano, Op. 103 * Concerto No. 8 in A major for cello and piano, Op. 130 Many of Goltermann's shorter works for cello are in the lower and medium technical difficulty level. * Nocturne in D minor for cello and piano, Op. 43, No. 3 * Nocturne in G major for cello and piano, Op. 49, No. 1 * Nocturne in G major for cello and piano, Op. 54, No. 1 * Nocturne in B minor for cello and piano, Op. 59, No. 1 * Nocturne in E minor for cello and piano, Op. 92, No. 1 * 3 Romances sans paroles for solo cello, Op. 90 * La Foi for cello and piano, Op. 95, No. 1 =Concerto No. 4 in G Major= The fourth cello concerto is often performed by students due to its relative ease of play.

He is of Pakistani Punjabi descent. He last played for Lancashire in the English County Championship. A right-arm seam bowler and useful lower-order right-handed batsman, outside cricket he works as a model. He is the first cousin of cricketers Kadeer Ali and Moeen Ali, both of whom used to play alongside Kabir for Worcestershire. In May 2015 he announced his retirement from cricket due to ongoing injuries. Early career After serving his apprenticeship in Worcestershire's Second XI and for the county's Board XI in the 38-County Cup for a couple of years, Kabir Ali made his first-class debut in a drawn game against Middlesex in September 1999. He bowled respectably enough, taking 2–36 and 1–22, but the match's lateness in the season robbed him of the chance to push for a regular place in the first team. Despite several appearances in the Benson & Hedges Cup in April 2000, including an impressive 4–29 on List A debut, Kabir spent most of the first part of that season still in the second team, although by the summer he had pushed his way into the full XI. Also in 2000, Kabir was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award for the most promising young Worcestershire player. Domestic success and international selection Over the following few years, Kabir gradually established himself as a hard- working bowler who was dedicated to his craft. His best period to date has been 2002-3; he took 138 first-class wickets in those two English seasons, including eight five-wicket innings hauls. International recognition first came during the 2002-3 winter, when he was invited to tour Australia with the ECB National Academy. It was thus unsurprising that he was selected to play for England in 2003, making his One Day International debut against Zimbabwe that July – although the game was a washout and Kabir had no chance to make an impression. He was also selected for the Fourth Test against South Africa at Headingley in August 2003, taking a wicket in his first over (Neil McKenzie, caught behind by Alec Stewart off Kabir's fifth ball). He took five wickets in the match: 3–80 in the first innings and 2–56 in the second, including the key wicket of Gary Kirsten (for 130 and 60) in both innings. Nonetheless, England were soundly beaten and the selectors rang the changes, bringing in Steve Harmison and Ashley Giles for Kabir and James Kirtley. The Headingley match was Kabir's solitary Test appearance, although he made a number of further appearances at ODI level. His greatest success came against South Africa in 2004/05, when he took more wickets (13) than any other England bowler, and at Bloemfontein somehow conjured a tie from nowhere. Domestic career Kabir first came to national prominence when he took a second-innings 5–48 (and eight wickets in the match) against the touring Zimbabwe side in May 2003; in a precursor to his final-over heroics at Bloemfontein, Kabir claimed the final two wickets with the scores level to tie the match. Kabir's life was touched by tragedy in July 2003, when his two-week-old nephew died. However, his father wished him to play for Worcestershire against Derbyshire a few days later, and he put in a magnificent display. After a quiet first innings with the ball, he scored a quickfire 68, putting on 104 with Steve Rhodes for the eighth wicket to help rescue his team from deep trouble at 190/7, and then ripped through the Derbyshire batting line-up to take 8–53, at the time the best innings analysis of his career. Thanks to Kabir's heroics, Worcestershire won the game by an innings. Kabir further demonstrated his batting credentials in September 2003, hitting 92 from 93 balls in a 45-over National Cricket League match against Essex, his maiden limited-overs fifty. The 2004 season began frustratingly for Kabir, as injury prevented him from playing until the end of May. However, some good performances in midsummer brought him a place in the squad for the Champions Trophy tournament in September, and he retained his place for the winter tour of South Africa (see above). Kabir's performances in early 2005 were unspectacular, but nevertheless he was named in the 14-man squad for that summer's triangular one-day series with Australia and Bangladesh. He played in none of the games, however, and was replaced by Matt Prior for the three-game ODI series against Australia which immediately followed. Kabir was not in England contention during the 2006 season, and for the winter of 2006–07 he turned out for Rajasthan in the Ranji Trophy along with teammate Vikram Solanki. Worcestershire's 2007 season began poorly, but Kabir claimed a career-best 8–50 in a rain-affected match against Lancashire in May. These were the best figures at Old Trafford for 13 years. On 15 August 2009 Hampshire confirmed they had signed Ali on a 3-year deal, subject to resolving Worcestershires demands for compensation of £60,000. Hampshire were not willing to meet Worcestershire's demands for compensation, making it seem as if Ali would have to honour the remaining year on his Worcestershire contract. In January 2010 Ali's dispute with Worcestershire was intensified, with Ali failing to report for pre-season training. Ali was released from his contract at Worcestershire on 21 January 2010. It is widely expected that Ali will take up the three-year contract he had agreed with Hampshire in 2009. The following day Ali confirmed he had joined Hampshire, signing a three-year contract at the Rose Bowl. Kabir Ali joined Barisal Burners of the Bangladesh Premier League, a Bangladeshi Twenty20 league, in February 2012. On 2 November 2012, Kabir Ali joined newly relegated Lancashire on a two-year contract. Kadir became an integral part of Lancashire's march straight back to the county top flight.

It is native to rivers and lakes in northern India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan, but has also been introduced elsewhere in South Asia and is commonly farmed. In Nepal and in neighbouring Indian regions up to Odisha, it is called Bhakura. Catla is a fish with large and broad head, a large protruding lower jaw, and upturned mouth. It has large, greyish scales on its dorsal side and whitish on its belly. It reaches up to in length and in weight. Catla is a surface and midwater feeder. Adults feed on zooplankton using large gill rakers, but young ones on both zooplankton and phytoplankton. Catla attains sexual maturity at an average age of two years and an average weight of 2 kg.  Taxonomy  left The catla was formerly listed as the only species in the genus Catla, but this was a synonym of the genus Gibelion. More recently, Catalog of Fishes has moved this species to Labeo.Eschmeyer W (2014) Cyprinus catla CAS Catalog of Fishes This species has been frequently confused with the giant barb (Catlocarpio siamensis) of south-east Asia, and the two taxa do bear an extraordinary resemblance to each other, especially in their very large heads.

He played all or part of eleven seasons in the Major League Baseball between 1942 and 1954 primarily as an outfielder, most often in right or center field. He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as tall and . Wyrostek was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals out of his East St. Louis high school. His contract was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates late in the 1941 season, and he played parts of the next two seasons with the Pirates as a reserve outfielder. On September 30, 1943, Wyrostek was traded back to the Cardinals. After a stint in the Army, his contract was sold to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1946, at which point he became an everyday player. Wyrostek averaged eight homers a year in his career, and had only one season in which he hit over ten. In 1948, he had a total of 17 home runs with another career high, 76 RBIs, which he would tie later. His seven stolen bases on the year also tied a career-high. In 1950, Wyrostek hit .285 with 8 homers and 76 RBIs with the Reds. On September 4 of that year, Wyrostek drove in eight of the Reds' 13 runs in a doubleheader sweep of the visiting Cardinals. By 1951, Wyrostek was a good-hitting outfielder who averaged about a .266 batting average. But that year, his batting average skyrocketed to .311. While his power numbers went down (2 HR, 61 RBIs), his batting average was good for sixth in the league and his 167 hits was 10th. He made his second and final All-Star team. In an 11-season career played with the Pirates, Phillies and Reds, Wyrostek batted .271 with 58 home runs and 481 RBIs in 1221 games.

It is the centrepiece building of the university precinctBristol University – Centre for Romantic Studies – Wills Memorial Building and is used by the university for degree ceremonies and examinations, which take place in the Great Hall.Bristol University  The University  Graduation Architecture commentator Nikolaus Pevsner described it as: :\\"a tour de force in Gothic Revival, so convinced, so vast, and so competent that one cannot help feeling respect for it.\\" It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building and serves as a regional European Documentation Centre. History The Wills Memorial Geology Library Wills Memorial Building, front face Great George in the tower of the Wills Memorial Building The Wills Memorial Building was commissioned in 1912 by George Alfred Wills and Henry Herbert Wills, the magnates of the Bristol tobacco company W. D. & H. O. Wills, in honour of their father, Henry Overton Wills III, benefactor and first Chancellor of the university who donated £100,000 to the university. Sir George Oatley, who also worked on a number of other buildings for the University, was chosen as architect and told to \\"build to last\\". He produced a design in the Perpendicular Gothic style, to evoke the famous university buildings of Oxford and Cambridge. The building was funded through the fortunes which the Wills family made through tobacco. Oatley later claimed that his inspiration for the building came from a dream where he saw a tower on a hill, with shields around it.Wills Memorial Building Construction started in 1915 but was halted in 1916 due to the continuation of World War I.http://www.gly.bris.ac.uk/www/services/museum/wmb.html Work resumed in 1919, and the Wills Memorial Building was finally opened on 9 June 1925 by King George V and Queen Mary, having cost a total of £501,566 19s 10d. The building was opened with a Royal Salute of 21 chimes from 'Great George', the nine-and-a-half ton bell within the octagonal belfry of the tower, which is tolled on the death of a monarch or chancellor. Oatley received a knighthood that year in recognition of his work on the building. In 1940, during the Bristol Blitz of World War II, the Great Hall with its hammerbeam roof was badly damaged by a German bomb-blast. It was restored in the 1960s to Oatley's original design: at the same time the adjoining wing was enlarged by Ralph Brentnall. = 21st-century controversy = The alleged connection of the Wills family to historical slavery via the U.S. tobacco industry attracted controversy in the 2010s, with some students petitioning the University of Bristol to rename the building in March 2017. In 2018, the University published a response and consultation on how to address the issue, including (amongst others) the suggestion of renaming University buildings and changing the crest. Description The building's dominant feature is the Wills Tower, built in reinforced concrete faced with Bath and Clipsham stone, with carving designed in collaboration with Jean Hahn of King's Heath Guild, Birmingham. At high it is over twice the height of the nearby Cabot Tower. It is 16 metres square and ornamented with heraldic shields. It is topped by an octagonal lantern which houses Great George (England's sixth-largest bell, weighing over 9.5 tonnes) which strikes on the hour. In addition to the Great Hall there is a General Library, Reception Room and Council Chamber and a further 50 rooms including some teaching space such as seminar rooms and lecture theatres. In the Entrance Hall are two ceremonial staircases. The building is also used as a conference venue.

It was released for PlayStation, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo 64. Announced shortly after Core became a star developer through the critical and commercial success of Tomb Raider, Fighting Force was highly anticipated but met with mixed reviews. Gameplay Players control one of four characters as they move through urban and science fiction environments, battling waves of oncoming enemies with weapons including soda cans, knives, cars, and guns. The player can make some choices as to which territory to travel through. Story The four characters have various reasons for taking on Dr. Dex Zeng, a criminal mastermind with an army at his command who predicted that the world would end in the year 2000. After New Year's Eve 1999, Dr. Zeng believed that there was an error preventing the apocalypse, so decides to correct it by destroying the world himself. The action starts with a police cordon around Zeng's office skyscraper, moving to such locales as a shopping mall, subway and Coast Guard base before finally ending at the top of Zeng's island headquarters. Characters A screenshot of Ben \\"Smasher\\" Jackson punching a generic enemy Players choose from a selection of four characters: Hawk Manson, Ben \\"Smasher\\" Jackson, Mace Daniels, and Alana McKendricks. Hawk Manson and Mace Daniels are two all-around characters. Hawk is somewhat stronger than Mace who is in turn faster than Hawk. Ben \\"Smasher\\" Jackson is a large and slow bruiser capable of lifting and throwing the engines of cars at enemies. Alana McKendricks is a fast but soft-hitting teenager with an effective jump- kick. All four characters have a special move that can be performed with the loss of a portion of health. Development Core Design collaborated with ten coders from EA Japan in making the game. The story line and character designs were done by Marc Silvestri. The character of Dr. Zeng was inspired by Heaven's Gate. Core Design originally pitched the game to Sega as a potential fourth entry in Sega's Streets of Rage series. Sega declined; according to Core, Sega explained that it had its own plans for continuing the series. Core opted to go ahead with the game as a standalone, multi-platform title, and started work on it. In addition to the PlayStation, Windows, and Nintendo 64 versions, a Sega Saturn version was developed and eventually completed. After Eidos decided against publishing this version, Sega Europe secured the publishing rights and announced a European release date of November 1997. However, it was cancelled. An early prototype, with older character designs, was leaked in November 2008.  Reception  The original PlayStation release received mostly mixed reviews. Critics overwhelmingly commented that the game has a satisfyingly large amount of interactive scenery to destroy or collect weapons from, but agreed that despite the transition to 3D, the gameplay was not meaningfully different from the 2D beat 'em ups of earlier console generations. GameSpot summed it up as \\"basically a 3D version of Capcom's classic, Final Fight, except the characters and enemies lack the personality that made Final Fight exciting.\\" Some, however, looked on the game's lack of innovation as a virtue rather than a liability; Shawn Smith commented in Electronic Gaming Monthly, \\"What's cool about Fighting Force is that it plays like the old side-scrolling games of the same nature. Then you might ask, why not just make a 2-D one. Well, when the 3-D works, why not go with it?\\" Next Generation took more of a middle ground, stating that \\"despite its derivative nature, Fighting Force is a very fun game. Yet, it's just not the same huge leap forward for the Final Fight genre that we might have expected from the creators of Tomb Raider.\\" Besides lack of originality, some critics criticized it for repetitiveness and took issue with how the control configuration assigns multiple actions to the same button while leaving other buttons on the controller unused, saying this often results in the character performing a different action than intended and leaving them open to enemy attacks. GamePro nonetheless opined, \\"Despite its few flaws, Fighting Force delivers the fierce fun and beat-fools-silly action that PlayStation gamers are looking for.\\" IGN, while contradicting GamePro by actually praising the game's controls, offered a somewhat more pessimistic overall take: \\"With solid graphics, impeccable control, yet almost zero innovation or variety, Fighting Force is a mixed bag. If in doubt, rent before you buy.\\" Ports and sequels A Nintendo 64 version of the game titled Fighting Force 64 and published by Crave Entertainment was released in North America and Europe in 1999. Differences include partially improved graphics and changes in the available number of player lives. A sequel, Fighting Force 2, was released in 1999 for the PlayStation and Dreamcast. Unlike the first title, Fighting Force 2 focuses on the character of Hawk Manson exclusively, and rewards a more stealthy approach. A second sequel, Fighting Force 3 was also in development for the Xbox and PlayStation 2, but was cancelled during development.

Although he also played the upright bass, he was one of the most popular electric bassists in the New York salsa scene, often playing in a funk style. He was a member of various notable salsa ensembles, including those by Johnny Pacheco, Héctor Lavoe and Willie Colón. During this time, he was also one of five bass players in New York City who recorded many of the \\"Jingles\\" for TV and radio; the others were Marcus Miller, Will Lee, Francisco Centeno and Neil Jason. Sal was born in Manhattan in 1955, and raised in The Bronx, New York City of Puerto Rican parents. He grew up in the streets of the South Bronx, where at the age of five his father began helping him develop his deep love of music. The demographics of the city during the time provided Sal with an array of musical influences which he absorbed and later incorporated into his bass playing technique and style. For his high school years he attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art. He performed and recorded with many salsa artists in New York for decades, before moving to Miami in his later years. Sal enjoyed the title of musical director to Willie Colón's orchestra both during Willie's collaborations with famed Panamanian singer/songwriter/actor Rubén Blades and Willie's solo singing ventures. Cuevas died on April 9, 2017, at Miami's Pembroke Pines Memorial Hospital. He had complications from diabetes and in previous days suffered a massive stroke and was left in a semicoma. Style The early to mid-1970s was a time when the electric bass guitar came of age with the likes of world-famous jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke established the instrument as a solo voice. Cuevas was an innovator of this style in Latin music, as on Ray Barreto album \\"Ricanstruction\\" where he takes solos alongside the horns. On a couple of tracks, he also uses sound modifying effects and foot pedals to add a different \\"color\\" to the sound of the bass. Sal is credited as being the innovator of Latin music bass playing when he first incorporated never before heard, nor utilized, Funk/Jazz/R&B;/Rock styles and techniques on the instrument. While maintaining the traditional flavor and concepts of authenticity within Latin music, he managed to fuse all those other \\"worlds\\" into his bass playing technique resulting in the creation of an innovative style. On some recordings for instance, he would play very intricate horn section lines or phrases on the bass in unison with the horns, which until then was virtually unheard of within the genre, as was his funky bass slapping and string snapping technique which today has become a norm for bassist within Latin \\"salsa\\" music thanks to Sal. He also incorporated the technique of \\"tapping\\" in his Latin bass playing. On the electric upright bass, Sal incorporated techniques which also (until then) were completely unheard of in Latin music such as slides (glissandi), and utilizing the very upper ranges of the instrument, as heard on \\"La ceiba y la siguaraya\\", recorded with Celia Cruz and Sonora Ponceña.

Azam was arrested by the Government of Bangladesh on 11 January 2012 after he was found guilty in war crimes charges during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. He founded the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh for East Pakistan during 1971 unrest that was aimed at to oppose the independence of Bangladesh. He led the party until 2000. On 15 July 2013, a Bangladeshi special tribunal, the International Crimes Tribunal found him guilty of war crimes such as conspiring, planning, incitement to and complicity in committing genocide and was sentenced to 90 years in jail. The tribunal stated that Azam deserved capital punishment for his activity during Liberation war of Bangladesh, but was given a lenient punishment of imprisonment because of his age and poor health condition. The trial was criticized by several international observers, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Human Rights Watch, which was initially supportive of a trial subsequently criticized \\"strong judicial bias towards the prosecution and grave violations of due process rights\\", calling the trial process deeply flawed and unable to meet international fair trial standards. Notably, it was at the center of the 2012 ICT Skype controversy. As a leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, he led the formation of the Shanti Committees that were formed at the time of the Liberation War alongside other pro-Pakistan Bengali leaders. Azam was accused of forming paramilitary groups for the Pakistani Army, including Razakars, and Al-Badr. These militias opposed the Mukti Bahini members who fought for the independence of Bangladesh, and also stand accused of war crimes. Azam's citizenship was cancelled by the Bangladeshi Government because of playing an opposition role during the Bangladesh liberation war. He lived informally in Bangladesh from 1978 to 1994 without any authorised Bangladeshi visa. His citizenship was then reinstated by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Azam was arrested on 11 January 2012 by the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh on the charges of committing war crimes during the Bangladesh liberation war. The tribunal rejected the plea of bail after noting that there were formal charges against Azam of which it had taken cognisance.Ghulam Azam is hospitalised after he loses bail appeal over war crimes, Corbis, 11 January 2012 He was 91 when he died of a stroke on 23 October 2014 at BSMMU. Several hundred thousand people attended his funeral prayers that were televised and held at the national masjid (mosque) Baitul Mukarram. Background Azam was born on 7 November 1922 in Bengal, former province of British India. He was the eldest son of Maulana Ghulam Kabir and Sayeda Ashrafunnisa. He attended a Madrasa in his village Birgaon, Nabinagar in Comilla and completed his secondary school education in Dhaka. He then joined Dhaka University where he completed BA and MA degrees in Political science. Early political career =University= While studying at the University of Dhaka, Azam became active in student's politics and was elected as the General Secretary of the Dhaka University Central Students' Union (DUCSU) for the two consecutive years between 1947 and 1949. As a General Secretary of the DUCSU, Azam in 1947 submitted a memorandum on the union's behalf to the Prime Minister of Pakistan Liaquat Ali Khan, demanding that Bengali be made a state language along with Urdu. At that time, Bangladesh was administered by the Pakistan. \\"Bangla was a wrong decision with regard to the establishment of Pakistan since Urdu was widely used and all Muslims of the Indian subcontinent were Urdu speakers.\\" =Jamaat-e-Islami= In 1950, Azam left Dhaka to teach political science at the Government Carmichael College in Rangpur. During this time, he was influenced by the writings of Abul Ala Maududi and he joined Maududi's party Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan in 1954, and was later elected as the Secretary General of Jamaat-e-Islami's East Pakistan branch. In 1964, the government of Ayub Khan banned Jamaat-e-Islami and its leaders, including Azam, and imprisoned them for eight months without trials. He played a prominent role as the general secretary of the Pakistan Democratic Movement formed in 1967 and later, he was elected as the member of Democratic Action Committee in 1969 to transform the anti-Ayub movement into a popular uprising. In 1969, he became the Ameer of the Jamaat in East Pakistan. He and other opposition leaders including future President of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took part in the Round Table Conference held in Rawalpindi in 1969 to solve the prevailing political impasse in Pakistan. On 13 March 1969, Khan announced his acceptance of their two fundamental demands of parliamentary government and direct elections.Keesing's Record of World Events (formerly Keesing's Contemporary Archives), Volume 15 (1969), May 1969 PAKISTAN, Page 23353 In the runup to the 1970 Pakistani general election, Azam together with leaders of a number of other parties in East Pakistan (including the Pakistan Democratic Party, National Awami Party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and the Pakistan National League) protested at the Awami League approach to electioneering for, accusing them of breaking up public meetings, physical attacks on political opponents and the looting and destruction of party offices.'White Paper on The Crisis in East Pakistan', Government of Pakistan, Islamadab, 5 August 1971 During 1970, while Azam was the head of Jamaat-e- Islami East Pakistan, a number of political rallies, including rallies of Jamaat-e-Islami, were attacked by armed mobs alleged to be incited by the Awami League.'White Paper on The Crisis in East Pakistan', Government of Pakistan, Islamadab, 5 August 1971, pg. 6–8'Police accused over rioting', The Guardian, 26 January 1970, pg. 4 Bangladesh Liberation War =Activities during 1971 War= During the Bangladesh Liberation War, Azam took a political stance in support of unified Pakistan, and repeatedly denounced Awami League and Mukti Bahini secessionists, whose declared aim after 26 March 1971 became the establishment of an independent state of Bangladesh in place of East Pakistan. Excerpts from Azam's speeches after 25 March 1971 used to be published in the spokespaper of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami named The Daily Sangram. On 20 June 1971, Azam reaffirmed his support for the Pakistani army by citing that 'the army has eradicated nearly all criminals of East Pakistan'. During the war of 1971, it was alleged that Azam played a central role in the formation of East Pakistan Central Peace Committee on 11 April 1971, which declared the independence movement a conspiracy planned by India.ঢাকায় নাগরিক শান্তি কমিটি গঠিত (Citizen's Peace Committee formed in Dhaka), Daily Pakistan, 11 April 1971. It was also alleged that Azam was one of the founding members of this organization. The Peace Committee members were drawn from Azam's Jamaat-e-Islami, the Muslim League and Biharis. The Peace Committee served as a front for the army, informing on the civil administration as well as the general public. They were also in charge of confiscating and redistribution of shops and lands from Hindu and pro- independence Bengali activists, mainly relatives and friends of Mukti Bahini fighters. The Shanti Committee has also been alleged to have recruited Razakars.The Wall Street Journal, 27 July 1971; quoted in the book Muldhara 71 by Moidul Hasan The first recruits included 96 Jamaat party members, who started training in an Ansar camp at Shahjahan Ali Road, Khulna. During Azam's leadership of Jamaat-e-Islami, Ashraf Hossain, a leader of Jamaat's student wing Islami Chhatra Sangha, created the Al-Badr militia in Jamalpur district on 22 April 1971. On 12 April 1971, Azam and Matiur Rahman Nizami led demonstrations denouncing the independence movement as an Indian conspiracy. During the war, Azam travelled to West Pakistan at the time to consult the Pakistani leaders. He declared that his party (Jamaat) is trying its best to curb the activities of pro-independence \\"Miscreants\\". He took part in meetings with General Yahya Khan, the military dictator of Pakistan, and other military leaders, to organize the campaign against Bangladeshi independence. On 12 August 1971, Azam declared in a statement published in the Daily Sangram that \\"the supporters of the so-called Bangladesh Movement are the enemies of Islam, Pakistan, and Muslims\\". He also called for an all out war against India. He called for the annexation of Assam. Azam was also alleged as the prime standard-bearer who presented the blueprint of the killing of the intellectuals during a meeting with Rao Farman Ali in early September 1971. According to this blue print, Pakistani Army and the local collaborators executed the killing of the Bengali intellectuals on 14 December 1971. =Allegations= Ghulam Azam meets Governor Lt. Gen. Tikka Khan, one of the top architects of Operation Searchlight on Apr. 4, 1971 in Dhaka On 20 June 1971, Azam declared in Lahore that the Hindu minority in East Pakistan, under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, are conspiring to secede from Pakistan. On 12 August 1971, Azam declared in a statement published in the Daily Sangram that \\"the supporters of the Bangladesh Movement are the enemies of Islam, Pakistan, and Muslims\\". On his side, Azam denied all such accusations and challenged by giving reasons to justify them., See video at 2:15 and 3:42. However, he later admitted that he was on the list of collaborators of the Pakistani army, but denied he was a war criminal. The military junta of General Yahya Khan decided to call an election in an effort to legitimize themselves. On 12 October 1971, Yahya Khan declared that an election will be held from 25 November to 9 December. Azam decided to take part in this election. On 15 October, the Pakistani government suddenly declared that 15 candidates were elected without any competition. According to the declaration of 2 November, as many as 53 candidates were elected without any competition.Muldhara '71 (মূলধারা '৭১ Mainstream '71) by Moidul Hasan, page. 128, footnote. 177. published by University Press Limited In this election Jamaat won 14 of the uncontested seats.International Herald Tribune; 4 November 1971 Former advisor to the Caretaker government of Bangladesh, human rights activist and witness for the prosecution Sultana Kamal said- \\"In brutality, Ghulam Azam is synonymous with German ruler Hitler who had influential role in implementation and execution of genocide and ethnic cleansing\\". In response to this statement, the defense counsel pointed out that the comparison was a fallacy and \\"fake with malicious intention\\" as Hitler held state power, which Azam did not and that in 1971 General Tikka Khan and Yahya Khan held state power. Prosecutor of ICT Zead-Al-Malum said- “He was the one making all the decisions, why would he need to be on any committee? Being Hitler was enough for Hitler in World War II.” * \\"Jamaat-e- Islami guru Ghulam Azam's role during the Liberation War 'was quite like Adolf Hitler in Second World War Germany'.\\" * \\"Next on the list is Ghulam Azam, the head of Jamaat in 1971, accused of overseeing the setting up of pro-Pakistani death squads manned by the party's student wing. The prosecution is seeking the death penalty for Mr Azam, whom it likened, in its closing arguments this week, to Adolf Hitler.\\" * \\"War crimes prosecutors on Sunday said that in 1971 Ghulam Azam did in Bangladesh what Adolf Hitler did in Germany during the Second World War. 'Ghulam Azam was the Hitler in Bangladesh under Pakistan army occupation in 1971', said prosecutor Zead-Al-Malum.\\" Leader of Jamaat- e-Islami Bangladesh Government of newly independent Bangladesh, banned Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and cancelled Azam's citizenship for playing alleged role during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Azam lived in exile in London until he was allowed to return home in 1978. Jamaat's rehabilitation began when Ziaur Rahman became president after a coup in 1975 and lifted the previous ban on religious parties. In 1977, Zia removed secularism in the constitution, replacing it with Islamic ideals, further clearing the way for Jamaat-e-Islami to return to political participation. In 1978, Azam returned to Bangladesh on a Pakistani passport with a temporary visa, and stayed as a Pakistani national even after his visa expired, he refused to leave the country and continued to live in Bangladesh. His stay was however unwelcome in Bangladesh, and he was beaten by an angry mob at the footsteps of the Baitul Mukarram mosque while attending a funeral in 1981. In the 1980s, Azam was particularly critical of the military rule of General Ershad after he seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and Jamaat-e-Islami took part in demonstrations and strikes as well as other opposition parties such as the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). He proposed a caretaker government system to facilitate free and fair elections, which was adopted in 1990. In the 1991 Bangladeshi general election, Jamaat-e-Islami won 18 seats and its support allowed the BNP to form a government. During this time, he acted unofficially as the Ameer (leader) of Jamaat-e-Islami until 1991, when he was officially elected to the post. This led the government arresting him and an unofficial court called \\"The People's Court\\" was established by the civilians such as Jahanara Imam to try alleged war criminals and anti-independence activists. Imam held a symbolic trial of Azam where thousands of people gathered and gave the verdict that Azam's offences committed during the Liberation War deserve capital punishment. In 1994, he fought a lengthy legal battle which resulted in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh ruling in his favor and restoring his nationality. In the 1996 election, Jamaat won only three seats, and most of their candidates lost their deposits. Azam announced his retirement from active politics in late 2000. He was succeeded by Motiur Rahman Nizami. War crimes trial =Arrest and incarceration= On 11 January 2012, Azam was arrested on charges of committing crimes against humanity and peace, genocide and war crimes in 1971 by the International Crimes Tribunal. His petition for bail was rejected by the ICT, and he was sent to Dhaka Central Jail. However, three hours later he was taken to the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) hospital for a medical check-up because of his aging. According to The Daily Star, Azam was allowed to remain in a hospital prison cell despite being declared fit for trial by a medical team on 15 January. The same paper later acknowledged that he had been placed there because to his \\"ailing condition\\". Azam's health was deteriorating rapidly since being imprisoned. His wife, Syeda Afifa Azam reported in several newspapers as being shocked about Azam's treatment and stated that he was very weak and had lost 3 kilograms in a month due to malnutrition. She described his treatment as \\"a gross violation of human rights\\" even though he was kept in a hospital prison cell. Azam's wife complained that he had been denied proper family visits and access to books, saying that this amounted to \\"mental torture\\". Azam is held in solitary confinement and is allowed a visit of 30 minutes per week by 3 close relatives only. Applications for visits are required to be made in advance and require approval. The Daily Star reported that Azam's wife and his counsels were allowed to meet him on 18 February. On 25 February 2012, The Daily Star further reported that Azam's nephew was denied a visit shortly before he was about to enter hospital prison. This was despite the application for the visit being first approved. Islamic activists from different countries expressed their concerns for Mr. Azam. The International Union of Muslim Scholars, chaired by Yusuf al-Qaradawi called the arrest \\"disgraceful\\", and called on the Bangladesh government to release him immediately, stating that \\"the charge of Professor Ghulam Azam and his fellow scholars and Islamic activists of committing war crimes more than forty years ago is irrational and cannot be accepted\\". The judicial process under which Azam was on trial was criticized by international organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. So far, the ICT has sentenced two of the accused to death and another one to life imprisonment. =Verdict= Azam was convicted of war crimes during the Bangladesh Liberation War by the International Crimes Tribunal-1 of Bangladesh. The charges against Azam were torturing and the killings of a police officer \\"Shiru Mia\\" and three other civilians. He was found guilty on all five charges and was sentenced to 90 years in prison. The judges unanimously agreed that Azam deserved capital punishment but was given a lenient punishment because of his aging and poor health condition. In a press release, Jamaat's Acting Secretary General \\"Rafiqul Islam\\" rejected the International Crimes Tribunal's verdict against Azam by stating his conviction \\"nothing but a reflection of what AL-led 14-party alliance leaders had said against him Ghulam Azam in different meetings\\". Pro-BNP newspaper Daily Amardesh, whose publication is currently ceased over publishing false news to instigate violence, reported that the evidence presented before the court against Ghulam Azam consisted of newspaper clippings published during 1971.\\" Death Ghulam Azam died after he suffered a stroke on 23 October 2014 at 10:10 PM at BSMMU while serving jail sentences for crimes against humanity during Bangladesh Liberation War. His death was reported by Abdul Majid Bhuiyan, director of BSMMU. Ghulam was put on life support system at 8 PM. He was also suffering from kidney ailments. Azam was buried at his family graveyard at Moghbazar, Dhaka on 25 October. His namaz-e-janaza (Islamic funeral prayer) was held at Bangladesh's national mosque Baitul Mokarram. The funeral was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourners. Different quarters of the country protested against taking Azam's body to the national mosque because of his war crimes conviction and his opposition role to the independence of the country.

Founded in 1982, SFNTC became a subsidiary of R.J. Reynolds when it acquired the company in 2002. Since 2004, Santa Fe Natural is part of the Reynolds American companies holding. History Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company was founded by Bill Drake, who had published The Cultivator's Handbook of Marijuana, Robert Marion, an acupuncture student at the Kototama Institute in Santa Fe, and Chris Webster, a Santa Fe Realtor. Drake had written his second book, The Cultivator's Handbook of Natural Tobacco, and began cultivating a strain of Nicotiana rustica a friend had found on the San Juan Pueblo. The men began mixing surplus bulk leaf tobacco from North Carolina and wild-grown rustica in the basement of Marion’s rented house. Startup investments came from Edward Wikes, a plumbing contractor, Robert Wolf, an oil rig roughneck, and Philip Naumburg, an heir to the Elkan Naumburg fortune. Drake purchased a Thomas Nast caricature of a Native American chief smoking a volcano for $250 and began using it as the company logo. After discovering Drake and Marion had been wasting funds on their “alternative lifestyle”, the board of directors and company investors took control of the company. Wolf became the company’s president and began marketing the product to retail outlets on Indian Reservations. The company moved into the basement of the adobe Gross Kelly warehouse building in Santa Fe’s downtown rail yard. In 1986, the company's board of directors hired Robin Sommers, a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who had been a subscription data specialist for Newsweek and Esquire in Greenwich Village before briefly running the Ice Palace nightclub on Fire Island. Sommers, who had paid for one of Drake’s experimental tobacco crops in 1981, implemented a direct-to-consumer advertising strategy, beginning by targeting New Age readers with coupon advertisements in the East West Journal, Rolling Stone, and the Utne Reader. Sommers commissioned a New York City graphic artist to design a new art deco logo. In 1987, the company made $88,000 in sales. After 1994 congressional hearings, Big Tobacco publicly released a 599-item list of additives in cigarettes. Whole Foods Market and natural food stores began carrying American Spirit. Sommers, who had become Chief Executive Officer, insisted in contracts with wholesalers on premium pricing for his cigarettes, explaining “I didn’t want them going to 7-Elevens.” Sommers moved the company from the rail yard warehouse to Santa Fe’s White Swan building located on Cerrillos Road. Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company agreed to add “Natural” to its product name after being sued by American Tobacco for trademark infringement. Natural American Spirit became popular with celebrities, with Sean Penn, Joni Mitchell, and Gwyneth Paltrow praising the cigarette in magazine interviews and Mac Miller having the company logo tattooed on his chest. In 1998, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company signed the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, where it was made to pay out less than Big Tobacco because the company was younger. In 1999, the company opened a new $4.5 million plant outside Oxford, North Carolina, using only organic certified farmers. In 2002, R.J. Reynolds bought Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company for $340 million. Sommers, who by then owned 42% of the company, signed a noncompete agreement and left the company. Profits rose 50% annually for the next decade. Sales of Natural American Spirit increased 86% from 2009 to 2014. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration sent the company a letter warning that “natural” and “additive- free” were false marketing of a “modified risk product”. In September 2015, Japan Tobacco International paid $5 billion for the right to manufacture and sell Natural American Spirit in Asia and Europe. Japan Tobacco has so far continued to source its leaf from Santa Fe Natural’s Oxford manufacturing plant, even sending its research scientists on a North Carolina State University agricultural extension tour. In September 2016, plaintiffs from twelve states sued Santa Fe Natural and Reynolds in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, seeking class action certification for consumer fraud from false labeling claims. In November 2016, a second lawsuit was filed for false advertising practices. Reynolds is represented in the litigation by Jones Day. In September 2015, a complaint was filed against Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging that the company's \\"organic and additive-free marketing claims for the Natural American Spirit brand\\" constituted fraud, false advertising, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and unfair competition.Richard Craver, Santa Fe cigarette lawsuits may be combined, Winston-Salem Journal (January 18, 2016). Two similar complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico on December 22, 2015. A third federal class-action lawsuit was filed against the company in January 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The suits may be consolidated.

In military usage, a riposte is the strategic device of hitting a vulnerable point of the enemy, thereby forcing him to abandon his own attack. In everyday language, a riposte is synonymous with a retort and describes a quick and witty reply to an argument or an insult. Etymology In sabre and foil, the priority switches when the parry is successfully executed; the defending fencer now has right of way and may immediately attack with a riposte. The riposte may be direct, or may include compound footwork. If the riposte is delayed, the original attacker's remise gains priority. Riposte is analogous to kaeshi techniques in kendo. When one sets up a second intention attack, the reactions of one's opponent must be predicted. A fencer may execute an attack expecting to be parried, preparing to counter-parry and counter-riposte. Military usage André Beaufre defines riposte in military usage as the act of striking a vulnerable point of an enemy, forcing him to abandon his own attack. The chosen target must be vital to the enemy or at least highly important, so that it becomes imperative to the enemy to defend it. The overall objective is to regain the initiative in battle.

He was the bishop of Richmond, Virginia, from 2004 until his death in 2017. Previously DiLorenzo was the fourth bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu, Hawaii. Early life, education and ordination Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, DiLorenzo was ordained to the priesthood in his hometown on May 18, 1968, at the age of 26. Auxiliary Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania On January 26, 1988, he was appointed an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Scranton. He was consecrated titular bishop of Tigias on March 8 of that year. Bishop of Honolulu In 1994, Joseph Anthony Ferrario, the Bishop of Honolulu, fell ill and requested that the Vatican accept his resignation for health reasons. Bishop DiLorenzo was named the Apostolic Administrator of Honolulu on October 12, 1993, and he was appointed bishop on November 29, 1994. His installation included hula dancing. In attendance were Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan, Apostolic Delegate, Cardinal Pio Taofinu'u of Samoa, and Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco. In 1997 DiLorenzo defended the use of hula in a variety of religious services in the diocese despite the Vatican's prohibition on liturgical dance, calling hula a native \\"sacred gesture\\". =Zero tolerance policy= Bishop DiLorenzo is often credited with creating the first zero tolerance policy on allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of priestsa policy that came about well before the Catholic sex abuse scandals that plagued the rest of the nation in the early 2000s. =Criticism= The most outspoken critic of DiLorenzo was the rector of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, Father Nathan Mamo. In a letter dated July 7, 1999, Father Mamo wrote, \\"I was quite upset over a whole host of problems in church governance, management and internal politics, problems which are real and grave.\\" Bishop DiLorenzo transferred Mamo from the Cathedral parish to a suburban church, Saint John the Apostle and Evangelist, in Mililani Town. Bishop DiLorenzo and Father Mamo continued to argue vehemently even after the transfer and Father Mamo decided to leave Hawai\`i. He wrote: \\"I have become over the most recent 5 years... completely unable to keep that solemn promise with the current bishop. It's not simply a matter of differing opinions; it's a matter of integrity. I am unable to respect and obey him because my conscience doesn't allow me to cooperate in his methods.\\" While remaining incardinated in the Honolulu see, Father Mamo was accepted for service in the diocese of San Jose, California, where he ministered as a parochial vicar at Saint Joseph of Cupertino Parish with the hope of eventually returning to Hawai\`i under a new bishop. In 2002, Bishop DiLorenzo retired Father George DeCosta, who had published a letter critical of Bishop DiLorenzo's Island Treasures program, which honored outstanding lay parish volunteers.letter to the editor of the Hawaii Catholic Herald Fr. DeCosta was the pastor of Malia Puka O Kalani Catholic Church in Keaukaha for thirty years. DeCosta later said he had taken advantage of the possibility of retiring at age 65, which required the bishop's permission, which DiLorenzo gave. Bishop of Richmond, Virginia On March 31, 2004, the Vatican announced the transfer of Bishop DiLorenzo to the see of Richmond. Bishop DiLorenzo was officially installed there on May 24, 2004. =Personnel changes= Just after his installation, Bishop DiLorenzo dismissed a member of the diocese's women's commission, Judy Johnson, of Virginia Beach. As of June 2005, Sister Edna Maier, S.N.D., and Sister Bernice McCourt, S.N.D., both members of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, and Mrs. Elizabeth Glenn, resigned their positions as pastoral coordinators with the diocese. Sister Edna had served as pastoral coordinator for a total of 21 years at Saint Paschal Baylon in South Boston and at Saint Elizabeth of Hungary in Brookneal. Sister Bernice had served the diocese since 1977 at St. Mary's Church in Chesapeake, Virginia, and plans to seek a ministry in Baltimore. Mrs. Glenn had served as pastoral coordinator at Resurrection in Portsmouth and Holy Spirit in Virginia Beach. Pastoral coordinators are paid positions with the diocese that can be filled by a deacon or a layman. Appointment to these positions is made by the bishop. Upon his installation, Bishop DiLorenzo reactivated the diocese's liturgical commission and named Father Russell Smith, S.T.D., parochial vicar at Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in New Kent County as diocesan theologian, a post that had been vacant since 1998. As theologian, Father Smith would examine for conformance to Catholic teaching all draft documents and issue approvals authorizing the publication of all printed materials generated by the diocese. Father Smith also would: (1) approve in advance any person who wishes to speak anywhere on Catholic church property in the diocese; (2) investigate complaints from parishioners who complain about liturgical abuses in a particular church and respond; and (3) recommend sanctions against persons responsible for such abuse to Bishop DiLorenzo. DiLorenzo noted that these kinds of checks and controls were needed because some people in the diocese were used to living outside the traditional boundaries of Catholicism. Bishop DiLorenzo forcibly retired Father Thomas J. Quinlan, pastor of Holy Family Catholic Church in Virginia Beach for a history of using offensive language during mass which culminated in a grossly sacrilegious reference to the Virgin Mary at a Christmas Eve Mass. Although a significant number of parishioners appealed against the decision, many applauded the decision, wondering why it had not been done sooner. =Diocesan administration= Bishop DiLorenzo moved his residence from Cathedral Place to Midlothian. Some Catholics raised questions about the move and see it as a way to distance himself from his flock. But DiLorenzo responded that he is only 25 minutes away from the diocesan offices and that the move saved the Diocese money: \\"Do I need to live in a three-story building by myself? I don't think so.\\" The three-story house was turned into offices for those working in a building that the diocese was renting for $35,000 a year. \\"We saved ourselves thirty-some thousand a year,\\" said Bishop DiLorenzo, \\"and I moved to Midlothian, a very quiet place.\\" Bishop DiLorenzo ended the diocesan sexual minorities commission, which his predecessor had established in 1977. He explained his decision: \\"What was being done was not a ministry. It was trying to make a statement... for people who see themselves discriminated against. The statement that needed to be made has been made. We are not going to make a big deal about what your fantasy sexual life is\\". He added that there are moral expectations for everyone: \\"I think most people would agree that the ministry is to call all persons to Jesus Christ in discipleship. The gender issue was not raised by Jesus.... Jesus called everyone to holiness. Are there certain groups in our population that need help in that journey?\\" Bishop DiLorenzo increased the number of clustered parishes. He also brought in consultants to review some diocesan departments and commissions that need to be abolished. =San Lorenzo Spiritual Center controversy= The spiritual director of the Richmond diocese's San Lorenzo Spiritual Center on Indian River Road, the Reverend Pantaleon Manalo, filed a lawsuit in Circuit Court, seeking $1.35 million alleging defamation by a group of people who accused him of financial improprieties, unexplained wealth, missing annual financial reports, abuse of power and making inappropriate sexual statements. The group consists of members or former members, of the San Lorenzo Spiritual Center, who in April 2004, sent a petition to a newly arrived Bishop DiLorenzo, alleging various acts committed by Father Manalo. The petition helped convince the vicar forane, Msgr. Thomas J. Caroluzza, to ask for Father Manalo's resignation in December. On December 10, 2005, Bishop DiLorenzo terminated Fr. Manalo's position, but then temporarily stayed that decision. After further investigation, DiLorenzo announced that Father Manalo had done no wrong, since the diocese investigated San Lorenzo Spiritual Center and not Fr. Manalo, but he would have to step down from his leadership post at the center. Although Father Manalo continued on as a spiritual director of the center and chaplain at two nearby hospitals. Bishop DiLorenzo appointed Father Salvador Anonuevo, pastor of Saint Luke parish in Virginia Beach, as administrator of the center. The San Lorenzo Spiritual Center is the site of spiritual and cultural celebrations for some 23,000 Filipinos living in Hampton Roads. On August 1, 2005, Judge Padrick, Circuit Court of Virginia, dismissed the defamation lawsuit in that it is an \\"intrusion into church affairs and violated the religious protections of the U.S. Constitution and the Virginia Constitution\\" per Brandon H. Zeigler, the defendants' attorney. Manalo's attorney, Robert L. Samuel Jr. said, he expects to appeal Padrick's ruling to the Virginia Supreme Court. Bishop DiLorenzo appointed the Rev. Jesse Enciso, Pastor of Holy Spirit Catholic Church, as the administrator of San Lorenzo Spiritual Center. The former administrator, Fr. Anonuevo, has returned to the U.S. after a three-month absence since May 2005. Fr. Jesse Enciso resigned his position as administrator effective October 15, 2005. This belies the difficulty and complexity that the center poses to any leadership. A new lay administrator is to be appointed by the Bishop. The Bishop has appointed Mrs. Marilyn Aguirre as interim administrator to San Lorenzo. Mrs. Aguirre and San Lorenzo Administration has reinstated Fr. Manalo as spiritual advisor to the center. Death Bishop DiLorenzo died from heart and kidney failure on August 17, 2017 at St. Mary's Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, at the age of 75.

In the 1970s the school enrolled in its adult-education program large numbers of old people, among them many who could neither write nor read English, and was investigated by federal and state authorities who believed that this was done mainly to obtain grants for tuition. The college expanded to include schools of law, education, social work, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry. In 2007, at least two school employees were found in an internal college audit to have accepted bribes to change grades and provide fake degrees. They were handed over for prosecution by the college, and were subsequently convicted and imprisoned. Lander remained president until his death in 2010, and was succeeded by Alan Kadish.  Ranking  Touro College is ranked #284 in National Universities. Schools are ranked according to their performance across a set of widely accepted indicators of excellence. One such indicator, the Time/MONEY's Value-Added All-Stars ranking, ranked Touro as the most economical college in the US.  Notable alumni  * Marc Alessi, politician * David G.

He was known for being the singer of Italian power metal band Rhapsody of Fire for 21 years. He later formed his own band Turilli / Lione Rhapsody with former Rhapsody of Fire guitarist Luca Turilli. He is also the current lead vocalist of Angra, and was the original singer of Labyrinth and Vision Divine. Musical career Lione was born in Pisa. His career started in 1990 at the age of 17 when he began to sing with a small rock and roll underground group who played classics of 1950s and 1960s similar to Elvis Presley's songs. He had a passion for groups such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Crimson Glory, which inspired him to form his own heavy metal band. His musical activities continued with a young group from Pisa, named Athena. They were a progressive metal band with their own unique style and challenged various expressions. Lione recorded a demotape with Athena and it was his first experience in a metal band. Lione did twenty shows with the band, but after two years, he left the band in 1994. Athena made their first album in 1995 (Inside the moon). At first his stage name was Joe Terry which was the combination of his favourite heroes' names in Japanese games (Joe Higashi and Terry Bogard from Fatal Fury). His first piece of musical equipment was a Shure SM 58 microphone. =Labyrinth= Lione met the band Labyrinth, then going under the name of \\"Vision\\". Shortly after, in 1993 the band started to work on a demotape called Midnight Resistance , lyrics and vocal lines written by Lione. Before the album No Limits was released, Lione recorded a mini CD with Labyrinth , [Piece of Time] lyrics and vocal lines written by Fabio Lione. Lione created the album No Limits together with Olaf, a band member of Labyrinth. His lyrics were mainly based on his personal experiences and his emotions. He wrote vocal lines and lyrics for this record, all the lyrics in the album were connected as Lione did this as an experiment. Labyrinth's style was different from other bands because it was mixed with different music genres including thrash metal and progressive rock. Lione was the singer of Labyrinth for just more than three years. =Athena= He joined Athena in 1991 and in 1992 they recorded their first demotape. After several concerts he left the band in 1993 for a new collaboration, the one with Labyrinth. Athena called Lione again in '97 ..so they could start work on their second album A New Religion which was released in 1998. Lione wrote the lyrics and the vocal lines for ten songs; the lyrics used religious and philosophical words and had the tendency to reflect deep meanings on their music. Lione and the other members of Athena attended Axel Rudi Pell Tour 1998 with Dreamscape, another progressive metal band from Germany in December. Shortly after the tour the band decided to break up. =Vision Divine= Lione at the Rockin' field festival of Milan in 2008 In 1999 he met Olaf Thorsen and to seal their newfound friendship, they decided to create what was originally supposed to be only a side-project: Vision Divine. Lione now found himself in the two groups: Rhapsody and Vision Divine, and this situation continued, with successes in both groups, until 2003. The first \\"Vision Divine\\" record in 1999 received excellent sales results and criticism (and took the band on tour in South America for the first time). The second album of Vision Divine Send me an angel was released in January 2002. Lione composed eight vocal lines for this album. Their expressions became more serious and deeper, close to the reality of divinity and humanity with progressive and heavy sounds. The album Beto Vazquez Infinity was released in February, including the song \\"The battle of the Past\\" in which Lione was singing as a guest vocalist for the Beto Vazquez project. In 2003 Lione sang at shows with Vision Divine at Gods of Metal 2003 (Milan) and at Heineken Jammin' Festival (Imola) in June. He then recorded four demo songs with Vision Divine in November and performed on an Italian Tour in December. Shortly after it was announced Lione had to leave the band, due to his other commitments making it too difficult front this band as well. He nevertheless spent most of the year writing and left the band nine new vocal lines for the \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" album, executed with a different singer. In 2008 Lione took part in some shows with Vision Divine to celebrate the ten years of the band, and on 28 May, they announced that Fabio had rejoined the band as the new singer. The band released the new CD \\"9 Degrees West of the Moon\\" in 2009 and did many shows supporting the record. In 2012 they released (with Edel/Ear music) what is probably considered their best work so far, \\"Destination Set To Nowhere\\", with many great reviews received. The band performed many shows in Italy, Spain and on a South-American tour supporting the record. Fabio departed from Vision Divine on 28 April 2018. =Rhapsody of Fire= In 1997, the most important and longest running moment began: becoming the lead vocalist of the heavy metal/power metal band Rhapsody. Rhapsody first began negotiations with Lione at Gate Pathway Studio in Wolfsburg, Germany after hearing him in the \\"Piece of Time\\" album from Labyrinth. Later that year, the first of many albums, Legendary Tales, was released with Lione as lead vocalist. The second album, Symphony of Enchanted Lands, would be released in 1998, followed by Dawn of Victory in 2000. The band participated in many concerts throughout their first years. Lione also recorded a new EP album Rain of a Thousand Flames with Rhapsody in Germany between April and August. The album was released in December 2001. Lione performed on stages with Rhapsody at Gods of Metal 2001 (Milan) in June, during South American Tour (Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and Chile) and at Rock Machina Festival (Spain) in July. After these concerts, Lione and Rhapsody recorded their fifth album Power of the Dragonflame. The album was released in March 2002. Rhapsody travelled with Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica on a successful European tour in April and May 2000 when they also had a chance to join the Wacken Festival 2000 in Germany. Lione attended Rock Machina Festival in Spain in July. Lione set out on Rhapsody's first headlining tour (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Japan and Korea) and joined the summer festivals in Europe including the Bang Your Head Festival in Germany. In February 2004, he finished vocals for Rhapsody's new album Symphony of Enchanted Lands II: The Dark Secret. The band went promo tour for their new album throughout Canada, US, Germany, Sweden, Czech Republic, Greece, and the UK. On the album's release day, 27 September, the band had a signing session with Christopher Lee in London. Lione also appeared with Christopher Lee on a TV music program in Germany. In 2005, because of copyright issues, the band officially changed its name to Rhapsody of Fire. Under the label Nuclear Blast, they released two more albums and one EP and did a worldwide tour as well as many festivals. Triumph or Agony was released in 2006, followed by The Frozen Tears of Angels and The Cold Embrace of Fear – A Dark Romantic Symphony in 2010 and From Chaos to Eternity in 2011. Rhapsody of Fire, with Lione at its helm, went back to the studio without long time guitarist and founding member Luca Turilli, to record a new album, Dark Wings of Steel , Fabio Lione wrote all the lyrics for this record. The album was released in 2013. In 2016, the band released the album Into the Legend , all lyrics written by Fabio Lione. After a short tour promoting the album, Lione announced on 28 September that he was parting ways with the band. From April 2017 to March 2018, he joined Turilli and his former bandmates to perform on Rhapsody's 20th Anniversary Farewell Tour. =Turilli / Lione Rhapsody= In December 2018, Fabio Lione and Luca Turilli announced that they have formed a new band: Turilli / Lione Rhapsody. They are joined by former members Alex Holzwarth, Patrice Guers and Dominique Leurqin. They released their debut album \\"Zero Gravity (Rebirth and Evolution)\\" on 5 July 2019.http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/luca-turilli-and-fabio-lione-reunite- for-turilli-lione-rhapsody/ =Kamelot= On 16 December 2010, the American power-metal band Kamelot announced that Lione would take over lead vocal duties for Roy Khan for the Kamelot's tour supporting their \\"Poetry for the Poisoned\\" release due to Khan's eventual departure from Kamelot. 70000 Tons of Metal was the last of 49 shows with them, in January 2012. =Angra= Fabio Lione with Angra at the 2014 Hellfest In January 2013, Fabio was again on the stage at 70000 Tons Of Metal, but this time with Brazilian progressive metal band Angra. The two shows were a great success and Fabio was again with them at the Live n' Louder Festival in São Paulo with Twisted Sister, Metal Church and Loudness. After that, the band decides to do a special tour, a commemorative one celebrating 20 years from the release of the first record \\"Angels Cry\\". They celebrate 20 years of career with 11 shows in Latin-America and the release of a new DVD, recorded in the last show in São Paulo. After that Angra played in Japan as co/headliner at the Loud Park festival 13 with Stone Temple Pilots and Europe and they had a very good response. The commemorative tour continues with another 14 shows in Latin America and 4 shows in Europe..where the band performed at Hellfest in France..with Black Sabbath, Soundgarden, Aerosmith and more ...after that, they enter in a studio in Sweden recording a new Cd. Angra announced that the band's new release, and the first album to feature vocalist Fabio Lione, entitled Secret Garden. The album was released by JVC in Asia on 17 December, via Universal Music in Brazil and Edel Music in Europe both on 16 January 2015, and then later in USA, Canada and Russia (date TBA). The album brings what the band has called \\"a true renewal in the style of the band.\\" With production by legendary producer Roy Z (Judas Priest, Bruce Dickinson, Halford) and was recorded and produced in Sweden by Jens Bogren (Kreator, Arch Enemy, Opeth). Eurobeat Lione's first Eurobeat song Eye of the Tiger was released in Japan in 2000. His name for Eurobeat project was \\"J. Storm\\", deriving from Joey Tempest. He published thirteen Eurobeat songs (list below) under this name between 2000 and 2005 and has declared that he wouldn't be making anymore Eurobeat in the future. However, by the end of 2013 a new song was released called \\"Dancing into fire\\". One of his songs, \\"Dancing in My Dreams\\", was also used in Initial D Battle Stage. * Eurobeat Disney 003 - J.

The words bevel and chamfer overlap in usage; in general usage they are often interchanged, while in technical usage they may sometimes be differentiated as shown in the image at right. A bevel is typically used to soften the edge of a piece for the sake of safety, wear resistance, or aesthetics; or to facilitate mating with another piece. Applications =Cutting tools= Most cutting tools have a bevelled edge which is apparent when one examines the grind. Bevel angles can be duplicated using a sliding T bevel. =Graphic design= Bevel filters in Inkscape Typographic bevels are shading and artificial shadows that emulate the appearance of a 3-dimensional letter. The bevel is a relatively common effect in graphic editors such as Photoshop. As such, it is in widespread use in mainstream logos and other design elements. Glass and mirrors Bevelled edges are a common aesthetic nicety added to window panes and mirrors. Geology Geologists refer to any slope of land into a stratum of different elevation as a bevel.Anvil Point - Some examples of bevels in landscape. Retrieved January 26, 2007. Sports In waterskiing, a bevel is the transition area between the side of the ski and the bottom of the ski. Beginners tend to prefer sharp bevels, which allow the ski to glide on the water surface.About.com or Goode Water Skis. Retrieved January 26, 2007. In Disc Golf, the 'beveled edge' was patented in 1983 by Dave Dunipace who founded Innova Champion Discs. This element transformed the Frisbee into the farther flying golf discs the sport uses today. Cards With a deck of cards, the top portion can be slid back so that the back of the deck is at an angle, a technique used in card tricks. Semiconductor wafers In the semiconductor industry, wafers have two typical edge types: a slanted beveled shape or a rounded bullet shape. The edges on the beveled types are called the bevel region, and they are typically ground at a 22 degree angle. Welding Beveling and chamfering (along with other profiles) are applied to thicker pieces of metal prior to welding, see Welding_joint#V-joints. The bevel provides a smooth clean edge to the plate or pipe and allows a weld of the correct shape (to prevent center-line cracking) to join the separate pieces of metal. Simple bevels can be used with a backup strip (thin removable sheet behind the plate joint) with chamfers (and a small land) being used on open root welds. Particularly thick plate will have a \\"J\\" shaped chamfer or \\"U\\" shaped groove to reduce the amount of welding filler metal used. Cruciform joint preparation can involve a double bevel to permit full penetration of each weld to the other, removing a possible void space in the center.

Fuchsberg Law Center, commonly known as Touro Law Center, is an ABA accredited law school. It is located on Long Island, New York, in the hamlet of Central Islip. The Law Center is part of Touro College and University System, a private, not-for-profit, coeducational institution based in New York City. Touro Law Center has 36 full-time faculty members and 58 teaching adjunct faculty. Of the Touro graduates who took the New York bar for the first time in July 2019, 63.4% passed, vs. a statewide average of 86% for ABA-approved law schools.  Campus  Touro Law Center is the only law school in Suffolk County, New York. After briefly beginning operations in Manhattan, the Law Center's first campus was established in the town of Huntington, which is located in northwestern Suffolk County. In 2007, the Law Center moved to its current campus in Central Islip. The Central Islip campus, consisting of a four-story, 180,000-square-foot building, is located within walking distance of both The Alfonse M. D’Amato United States Courthouse and the John P. Cohalan State Court Complex, in which the Suffolk County District and Family Courts and the New York State Supreme Court sit.  Programs  = Curriculum = Students may enroll in either a program to earn a Juris Doctor (JD) degree or a Master of Laws (LLM) degree. Both full-time and part-time programs are available to students in the JD program. Touro Law Center is one of several law schools in New York State to offer a two-year accelerated JD program, in which accepted students fulfill their credit-requirements of study within 24 months, beginning with the summer of their first year, and sit for a Bar Examination 26 months after they begin their law school studies. In addition, Touro Law Center offers an accelerated JD program, referred to as a \\"three-plus-three\\" (BA/JD) program, with the University of Central Florida, and an accelerated JD Program which allows graduates of foreign law schools to earn a J.D. degree in two years. Touro Law Center offers four concentrations for J.D. candidates, an L.L.M program for U.S. law school graduates and a Master of Laws in U.S. Legal Studies for foreign law graduates, and joint J.D./M.B.A, J.D./M.P.A., and J.D./M.S.W. programs with Touro College, State University of New York at Stony Brook, and LIU-Post. Touro Law Center has at times offered summer programs in Vietnam, Germany, Croatia, China, and Israel. Only the Vietnam program was offered for the summer of 2018. In 2011, when the Vietnam program was first offered, Touro Law Center was the only law school to offer such a program within the borders of Vietnam. = Experiential learning programs = In September 2013, Touro Law Center joined the Educating Tomorrow's Lawyers Consortium, which consisted of 31 ABA-accredited law schools that have demonstrated a commitment to innovation in legal education and offer a number of law school courses \\"that implement a student-centered approach to legal education\\". The consortium was dissolved in 2017. In 2013, PreLaw Magazine recognized Touro Law Center as one of six law school schools in the nation offering innovative clinical and experiential learning opportunities, highlighting the law school's ProBono Uncontested Divorce Project. Touro Law Center is also a member of the Alliance for Experiential Learning in Law, an alliance that currently has 113 law school and legal service organization members, which was established in 2011 with the goal of integrating experience-based education into the traditional law school curriculum. In Fall 2006, the Law Center began a pilot program that required all first year students to observe courtroom practice in both the federal Alfonse M. D’Amato United States Courthouse and the John P. Cohalan State Court Complex. In 2009, the Center for Court Innovation issued a report on its three-year study of the pilot program; the report concluded that consideration should be given to expanding the program either through increased observation opportunities or participation of students beyond their first year of law school. As of 2011, the program is a graduation requirement in which all first year students must participate, and upper-level students have the option of continuing the curriculum through coursework and court externships, clerkships, or pro bono projects. = Clinics and Centers = Touro Law Center's clinical program consists of legal clinics that specialize in the areas of: *Bankruptcy & Mortgage Foreclosure *Criminal Law (State Defense/Prosecution & Federal Prosecution) *Disaster Relief *Education and Youth Justice Clinic *Elder Law *Family Law *Immigration Law *Small Business and Not-for-Profit Law *Veterans' and Servicemembers' Rights Touro Law Center also hosts the following Institutes and Centers: *Aging and Longevity Law Institute *Center for Innovation in Business, Law & Technology *Institute of Land Use and Sustainable Development Law *Jewish Law Institute *TLC Heart (TLC – Hurricane Emergency Assistance and Referral Team) *International Justice Center for Post-Graduate Development The International Justice Center for Post–Graduate Development serves as a national clearinghouse for the law- school based incubator movement. Led by Fred Rooney, the Center launched Touro's Community Justice Center in 2013, housing eight-ten start-up law firms owned by Touro alumni. The William Randolph Hearst William Randolph Hearst Public Advocacy Center (PAC), established in 2007, has 14 offices and houses on-campus non-profit legal service providers such as the Nassau/Suffolk Law Services Committee, Inc. (grant recipient of the Legal Services Corporation), New York Civil Liberties Union, and the Empire Justice Center (member of the Consumer Federation of America); there are also additional off-campus member affiliates. Thomas Maligno has served as the Executive Director of the Public Advocacy Center since it opened.  History  Touro Law Center was established and admitted its first class in the Fall of 1980. The first class graduated in Spring 1983, and in that same year, the Law Center was provisionally accredited by the American Bar Association. It began operations in a building located at 30 West 44th Street in Manhattan, New York City, which is now the home of the Penn Club of New York. In 1982, the law school moved to the town of Huntington in Suffolk County, New York and the building it occupied for twenty years, formerly Toaz Junior High School. At the time of its move to Huntington, Touro Law Center was the only law school on Long Island to offer a part-time program to students. In April 1986, the Law Center was officially named the Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center, in honor of Judge Jacob D. Fuchsberg, who served as an associate judge of the New York State Court of Appeals from 1975 to 1983. Judge Fuchsberg began serving on the Board of Trustees of Touro College at the time it was established in the 1970s, and during his tenure on the Board, he advocated for the establishment, accreditation, and growth of the Law Center. The Law Center achieved full accreditation by the American Bar Association in 1989. = Deans = John S. Bainbridge was the dean of the law school from 1982 to 1985. During his tenure, Bainbridge recruited the founding faculty and administrators and guided the school through the first American Bar Association inspection that led to its provisional national accreditation. Howard A. Glickstein served as the dean of the Law Center from 1986 to 2004. During Glickstein's tenure, the Law Center was accepted as a member of the American Association of Law Schools, which occurred in 1994. During his eighteen-year tenure, Glickstein also oversaw the initial plans for the Central Islip, New York campus and the development of the construction project. Construction on the new campus began in March 2005, shortly after Glickstein's tenure ended. From 2004 to 2012, Lawrence Raful served as dean. During Raful's tenure, the construction of the Central Islip campus took place, opening in 2007. In 2012, Patricia Salkin was appointed the dean of the law school. She served until 2016, when she was promoted to the position of provost of graduate and professional studies for the Touro College and University system. Harry Ballan, senior counsel at Davis Polk & Wardwell, LLP was subsequently appointed to the position. In June 2019, Elena B. Langan was announced as the new dean of the law school, having previously served as dean of Concordia Law School and interim dean of Nova Southeastern University's Shepard Broad College of Law.{{  Legal scholarship & publications  In May 2014, Touro Law Center was identified by one law school rankings system as the 13th \\"most undervalued\\" law school in the country, based on the spread between the Law Center's U.S. News peer reputation and the number of downloads from the Social Science Research Network of Touro law faculty scholarship. This particular system, first established in a law review article in 2006 by two law professors, compares the U.S. News Rankings to scholarly impact as measured by download counts from the Social Science Research Network.

It often includes elongation, altered flowering time, increased apical dominance and altered partitioning of resources. This set of responses is collectively called the shade-avoidance syndrome (SAS). Shade responses display varying strength along a continuum. Most plants are neither extreme shade avoiders or tolerators, but possess a combination of the two strategies; this helps adapt them to their environment. However, the ability to perceive and respond to shade plays a very important role in all plants: they are sessile by nature and access to photosynthetically active radiation is essential for plant nutrition and growth. In addition, the time at which a plant starts to flower is affected by the amount of light that is available. Over the past few decades, major increases in grain yield have come largely through increasing planting densities. As planting densities increase so does the proportion of far red light in the canopy. Thus, it is likely that plant breeders have selected for lines with reduced SAS in their efforts to produce high yields at high density.  Sensing shade  Plants can tell the difference between the shade of an inanimate object (e.g. a rock) and the shade of another plant, as well as the presence of nearby plants that may compete with and shade it in the future. In the shade of a plant, far red light is present in a higher irradiance than red light, as a result of the absorption of the red light by the pigments involved in photosynthesis, while a nearby plant forms an intermediate ratio. This is known as far red enrichment. Phytochrome can be used to measure the ratio of far red to red light, and thus to detect whether the plant is in the shade of another plant, so it can alter its growth strategy accordingly (photomorphogenesis). In Arabidopsis, phytochrome B is the predominant photoreceptor that regulates SAS. Phytochromes exist in two forms: PR and PFR. It is synthesised as PR, but red light triggers a conformational change, producing PFR. Far red light causes the phytochrome to be converted back into PR. For a given red:far red light ratio, there will be a dynamic equilibrium in the relative quantities of PR and PFR present. Far red enrichment causes a build-up of PR. If PR is present above a species- specific threshold, shade avoidance signal transduction pathways will be activated.  Seedling response  Seedling response is the most well understood factor of shade avoidance. In the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, the shade avoidance response varies at different points in the life cycle. Dry, dormant seeds will not germinate if they are in the shade. Once dormancy has been broken and they have imbibed water, the seeds are committed to germination. Water-imbibed seeds display hypocotyl elongation; if the shade were caused by excessive soil depth, this would help the seedling grow vertically very quickly and push up and out of the ground. If an Arabidopsis seedling becomes shaded, its petioles and internodes elongate. It may even lose rosette morphology. = Pathway = Studies using Brassica rapa indicate that the light quality and ratio available to seedlings is sensed in the cotyledons, which upregulates the production of auxin. Arabidopsis was used to demonstrate PIF (Phytochrome Interacting Factor) involvement in auxin production. PIFs are transcription factors that regulate thousands of genes related to germination repression and shade avoidance, and PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7 directly regulate genes that code for the enzymes required in auxin synthesis. Other PIF proteins are thought to be involved in regulating auxin and the plant's response. In shade conditions, PR induces the dephosphorylation of PIF proteins, which strengthens their ability to bind DNA and promote transcription of genes involved in shade avoidance response, including in the production of auxin and its receptors. Auxin is transported to the hypocotyl to promote elongation, although the mechanism it uses to do so remains unclear.  Adult response  Shade avoidance response in adult plants is less commonly studied than it is in seedlings, though adult Arabidopsis show more complex response patterns than seedlings. Shaded adults have elongated petioles at the rosette, smaller leaf blades, and suppressed axillary bud growth. By elongating the petiole sideways, the plant repositions its leaves away from shading plants to absorb more red light, though there is a trade off in leaf size. The leaves can also bend upwards towards potential light sources as a result of higher growth on the underside of the petiole than the top, a process called hyponasty. Flattening of leaves in plants with normally curled leaves also increases surface area for light absorption. If a mature plant becomes shaded, shade avoidance also often prompts changes in reproductive strategies. Plants may flower early, as it is unlikely that growing more structures will result in profitable nutrient gain in the short term. In Arabidopsis, early flowering is linked to overall lower reproductive success due to lower seed production, smaller fruit, and lower germination rate of seeds, although germination success is also dependent on genetic variation between individuals. = Pathway = Like seedlings, adult plant shade avoidance involves several mechanisms acting together. Petiole elongation is both a result of cell expansion and cell division, though not at the same stage in petiole and leaf formation. In newly growing leaves, cell division is the primary factor, while fully formed leaves and petioles rely on cell expansion. Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) are a family of cell wall modifying proteins. In shade conditions, the genes coding for XTH9, XTH15/XTR7, XTH16, XTH17, and XTH19 are up-regulated and these proteins act to hydrolyze and weaken the cell wall, allowing for expansion of the petiole cells. Like in seedlings, PIF7 is involved in the regulation of petiole and leaf growth due to low R:FR, by up-regulating auxin-related and brassinosteroid-response genes which promote growth. Auxin signalling is also essential to hyponasty, though its role is not yet fully understood. Leaf curling is primarily a response to phytochrome B converting to PR in shade conditions, which promotes unequal proliferation and growth of cells on the upper and lower leaf sides. Two redundant genes, ATHB4 and HAT3, code for transcription factors that regulate leaf curling, with loss of function mutants having plants with leaves that curl downwards, and plants with over- expressive copies of these genes having leaves that curl strongly upwards. By changing expression of these genes, plants can straighten their leaves in response to shade.

It was released in 2002 for the Neo- Geo MVS arcade platform, and is the fourth game in the Metal Slug series. Two years later, Playmore published Metal Slug 4 for consoles. Metal Slug 4 retains the same gameplay as previous titles, with the addition of some enemies, bosses, weapons, several vehicles and a bonus combo system. It was ported to Xbox and PlayStation 2 as a stand-alone game in Japan and Europe, and along with Metal Slug 5 as a compilation in North America and South Korea. Nintendo Switch version was released in 2018.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. A bonus scoring system was added that allows the player to be rewarded depending on how many enemies are killed in the time allotted. The time allotted is determined from the type of emblem that is picked up. A time meter will appear on the top of the screen, and if the player lives through the end of the level, they will be awarded bonus points for badges that represent feats accomplished. Eri and Tarma were replaced with Nadia and Trevor. Plot One year after the events of Metal Slug 3, the world is under the threat of a mysterious and deadly cyber virus that threatens to attack and destroy any nation's military computer system. With Tarma Roving and Eri Kasamoto unable to help out due to their own assignments in the matter, Marco Rossi and Fiolina Germi are called in to investigate the situation and are joined by two newcomers, Nadia Cassel and Trevor Spacey. In their investigation, the group discovers that a rich terrorist organization known as the Amadeus Syndicate is behind the plot and has allied with General Morden's Rebel Army. They head into battle against Amadeus' forces, hoping to destroy the cyber virus before it gets the chance to wipe out the entire world's military computer system. Halfway through the game's story mode, the player is confronted by who they presume to be General Morden. In the final stage, they find an underground facility where android doubles of Morden are being manufactured. Allen O' Neil fights the player and is also revealed to be a machine replica. The player confronts the leader of the syndicate, Dr. Amadeus, who attacks with a series of powerful robots, but he is defeated and is trapped in his own devices as the base self-destructs, killing him. If the player safely escapes the base's bonus explosion stage, the credits will show the main cast eating a feast of food, but if the player gets caught in the explosion, the player character will appear in the hospital, bandaged and bed- ridden, being brought get-well gifts of food from both Tarma and Eri. After the credits, a single computer monitor is seen transmitting data to an unknown location before shutting down. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Metal Slug 4 on their May 1, 2002 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the year. Metal Slug 4 was mixed to positive received by players with users scores of 7.8 for PS2, 7.3 for Xbox, 8.1 for Neo Geo and 8.3 for the arcade versions. While Metacritic and Gamrankings are given with 70.47% and 70 alongside with Metal Slug 5 as compilation for both PS2 and Xbox score.

Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that, under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), facilities that accept federal funds cannot deny prisoners accommodations that are necessary to engage in activities for the practice of their own religious beliefs. RLUIPA prohibited the federal government from imposing a substantial burden on prisoners' freedom of religion.

The Pitcairners are greeted by the Administrator and his wife, and from the pier they march to the cenotaph where they lay wreaths in remembrance. From the cenotaph they then march to the cemetery where hymns are sung. Next, they proceed to Government House where a family surnamed either Quintal, Evans, McCoy, Buffett, Adams, Nobbs, Christian or Young (being descendants of the Pitcairners of that ilk) is awarded the title of 'Family of the Year'. The children roll down the hill in front of Government House, after which the whole procession travels to the Compound where the children play games and partake of a celebratory feast. Finally, everyone returns home to prepare for the Bounty Ball, at which there is a competition in further celebration of Bounty Day.

Havertown's ZIP Code is 19083 and \\"Havertown\\" is a postal address. The name \\"Havertown\\" does not appear until the advent of the ZIP Code in the early 1960s. Prior to the ZIP Code's introduction, each constituent community was known by its local name: Bon Air, Brookline, Penfield, Beechwood, Llanerch, Manoa, Oakmont, Coopertown, Ardmore. Under William Penn's land divisions these communities were part of the Welsh Tract and comprised the area known as Harford, a Welsh contraction of Haverford. History Haverford Township was founded by Welsh Quakers in 1681 on land purchased from William Penn. The settlers named their new home after Haverfordwest, Wales, UK. The township is home to many historic sites. The Grange Estate, entertained the Revolutionary War figures George Washington and General Lafayette. Nitre Hall, along Karakung (Cobb's) Creek, supplied the United States with over 800,000 pounds of gunpowder during the War of 1812. Leedom Hall was the probable home to William Howell the founder of Haverford Mills which date from 1688. Other Havertown sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Federal School and Lawrence Cabin. Coopertown, appears as early as 1848 as the first community and the earliest post office is found at the Spread Eagle Tavern at the junction of the present Eagle and Manoa Roads. alt=Historic Roads The Haverford Road is one of the earliest roads laid out by civil ordinance. Dates for its layout and completion vary from 1687 to 1703. Darby Road, known earlier as Coopertown Road dates from 1687. Records show its extension to Radnor the “principal market for corn,” ordered in 1696. Mill Road, at one time called Dickinson Mill Road, may be one of the earliest roads of popular use. Its zig-zag pattern illustrates the indirect path required by horse and cart going up or down hill. Eagle Road which takes its present name from the Spread Eagle Tavern c.1814 led Quaker settlers to the Haverford Meeting House The Railroads and Planned CommunitiesBrookline Manor c. 1925 Prior to the First World War Haverford was a township of extensive farms. Property maps in 1862 indicate that the landowners were descendants of the same families that arrived with William Penn: among them, the Lawrences, the Ellis’, the Humphreys and the Lewis’. In 1895 The Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company begins service between 69th Street and West Chester with a major junction at Llanerch. By 1902 the maps indicate a significant change in land ownership. Most of the old family names no longer appear. In that same year on May 29, the trolley line opened the branch from Llanerch to Ardmore. Llanerch first appears as a small community with numbered streets. Darby Road is called Coopertown Road. A commercial rail line, now removed, served Boyle Fuel, Lobb Lumber and the Swell Bubble Gum factory up until the 1960s. (See Map) Llanerch Llanerch situated at the intersection of West Chester Pike and Darby Road was the first planned community of Haverford Township. Like many other suburban communities Llanerch was the child of the railroad companies. The railroad built houses for commuters and the commuters bought tickets for the rail lines. In 1897 the community was composed of twelve houses and Saint Andrew's Church. These houses and the church were designed by Philadelphia architect Frank Allison Hayes (1866–1930).https://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/22160 Llanerch's first school followed in 1905. The present school structure, no longer functioning as a school, dates from 1913. Brookline The Boulevard Theater Grand Opening 1928 Brookline, while not the first planned community, was the most fully executed. The Mueller Atlas of Delaware County, 1909, shows the initial layout for Brookline. At that time Darby Road between Eagle Road and Llanerch was called Haverford Road. Some construction began around that year, but it was not until after the First World War that the Manor Real Estate Company, a subsidiary of the railroads set out a plan for a housing development that offered every service, amenity and community need: “Brookline Manor.” (See Map) As in the 1909 plan we find an arrangement of regular streets divided by a broad “Boulevard.” The Boulevard intersected at a “T” juncture with the major township thoroughfare, Darby Road. The “Boulevard” would be home to commercial, religious and educational services. At the upper end of the “Boulevard” mercantile stores provided shoe makers, tap rooms, florists, bakery, barbers, a Five and Ten, the Quaker Store, the A&P; grocery store and the Boulevard movie theater. (See Image) Along the length of the Boulevard the community found their religious houses of worship: The Methodist Church, Saint Faith Episcopal Church, The Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Temple Lutheran. On Earlington Road, to the side of the Boulevard's far end The Brookline School (1913) met educational needs. Brookline Country Club and Airport Returning to the intersection of the Boulevard with Darby Road we follow Darby Road west. Just beyond the intersection we find the Brookline Fire Company (1916). The Brookline Library (1938) and the Haverford High School (1923) are on Darby Road just beyond the Brookline Fire Company. In the early days the Brookline County Club and the Brookline airport were situated just behind Haverford High School. (See Image) Returning to the intersection of Brookline Boulevard and Darby Road at the corner of Manoa Road were the Police Station on the west side and Shearer's greenhouse and nursery on the east side. The railroad company attended to their needs to sell tickets as well as to that of Brookline Manor for transportation. The Red Arrow Trolley line #103 ran from Ardmore down Darby Road then on to West Chester Pike to 69th and Market Streets, thus offering commuters quick access to the city. (See Image) The tracks which divided Darby Road were lined with fences of early blooming red roses. A bus line ran from Ardmore to 69th and Market by way of Brookline Boulevard and Earlington Road. The junction of the two lines was at the intersection of Darby Road and Brookline Boulevard. At the far end of Brookline Boulevard commuters found the services of the P&W;, The Philadelphia and Western high-speed line. An electric train system that even today is one of the most rapid. With trolley lines at one end, the P&W; at the other and a bus that ran between the two transportation to Philadelphia could not have been more convenient. The electric trolley lines were shortsightedly dismantled in 1966 in favor of gasoline operated buses. The Irish in Havertown 1860 Census The arrival of the Irish in Haverford Township occurs in three phases: the 19th century mill era, the early 20th century railroad communities and the post World War II suburban housing tracts. Born in Ireland in 1779, Dennis Kelly arrived in Philadelphia in 1806. After several years of manual labor Kelly became the prosperous owner of the complex of mills along Karakung Creek. Kelly and his mills attracted the first Irish Catholics to the otherwise Protestant community. 1860 census records attest to the Irish presence and their occupations in the mills. In 1822, mindful of duty to community and faith, Kelly bought and donated land opposite the Friends’ Meeting House on the hilltop above the mills for the construction of the first Catholic Church. The second and more significant arrival of the Irish comes with the planned community of Brookline c.1925 and portions of Manoa and Oakmont. In 1927 the Church of the Annunciation and The Church of the Sacred Heart together with their schools assured Catholics seeking life in the suburbs of a religious home. The third and largest phase of the Irish move comes with the large brick house tract developments of Beechwood, Chatham Park and Manoa. Today according to the 2000 US Census, Haverford Twp. ranks in the top 60 of census-recognized municipalities nationwide in percentage of population with Irish ancestry. Bubble Gum Havertown is the birthplace of Swell Bubble Gum, founded 1947, which closed in late 2004 and was demolished in 2011. In 2013, the site became the home of the new Haverford Area YMCA.Haverford Area YMCA. Parks and recreation Havertown is home to over 30 outdoor parks and playing fields. The town also provides other recreation facilities, including the Haverford Township Free Library, and the Haverford Township Skatium, a multi-use ice rink for Havertown residents. Parks in Havertown include: Llanerch Park Karakung Field/Drive Chatham Glen The Grange Field Haverford Reserve/Freedom Playground Haverford Music Festival Ardmore Trolley Line 1966 The concept for the Haverford Music Festival was introduced by the Haverford Township Civic Council (HTCC),Haverford Township Civic Council a private, non-profit organization that funds historic, environmental, business, and community initiatives in Haverford Township. Inspired by the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Bethlehem Musikfest and other music festivals in the area, the all-day, family-oriented Haverford Music Festival has taken place annually in the Oakmont Business District of Havertown since 2011. In 2012, the festival attracted more than 15,000 people, who enjoyed over 30 bands on three stages. HTCC benefits from festival proceeds and uses to fund community-based programs within Haverford Township. Proceeds from the 2011 Music Festival were given to the Haverford Partnership for Economic Development (HPED) for Oakmont Business District Beautification. Education Haverford High School Havertown is served by the School District of Haverford Township, which has one high school, one middle school, and five elementary schools. A newly refurbished elementary school, Chestnutwold Elementary, re-opened its doors in early September 2008. It replaced Oakmont Elementary, which became home to the district offices. In 2009, Manoa Elementary School moved from Manoa Road to the intersection of Manoa and Eagle Roads, taking part of the field that had been there for many years. The Haverford High School sports teams are called the \\"Fords,\\" and have a Model T Ford as mascot. Haverford High School had the honor of being the only high school in the Philadelphia area to host the One Book, One Philadelphia author Julie Otsuka. Otsuka's The Buddha in the Attic is a recent PEN/Faulkner Award-winning work of historical fiction and a National Book Award finalist. Cardinal John Foley Regional School is the area Catholic school. It formed in 2012 from a merger of Annunciation B.V.M. and St. Denis Catholic schools. Police and fire The town is protected by the Haverford Township Police Department and five volunteer fire companies that make up the Haverford Township Bureau of Fire: # Oakmont 38 (http://www.oakmontfire.org), which houses the following apparatus; Engine 38, Squad 38, Ladder 38, and Rescue 38 # Manoa 56 (http://www.manoafire.com), which houses the following apparatus; Engine 56, Squad 56, Rescue 56, Utility 56 and 56-8. # Brookline 35 (http://www.brooklinefirecompany.org), which houses the following apparatus; Engine 35, Ladder 35, Foam 35, and Spill 35 # Llanerch 34 (http://www.llanerchfire.org), which houses the following apparatus; Engine 34-1 and Engine 34-2, and Tower 34. # Bon Air 58 (http://www.bonairfire.com), which houses the following apparatus; Pipeline 58, Squad 58, and Rescue 58 # EMS coverage is currently contracted to Narberth Ambulance Environmental remediation Havertown has a Superfund site caused by the National Wood Preservers wood treatment facility, which was in operation from 1947 to 1991. The chemical used to treat wood at this site was dumped into the ground. The Environmental Protection Agency began remediating the site in 1976, and they completed construction of the cleanup site on September 16, 2010. The groundwater continues to be extracted and treated on a continuous basis. Although approximately 26,000 people live within a mile of the site, there are no known users of the groundwater within a one-mile radius of the site. The nearby population is on the public water supply.

History The beginnings of Hollenthon date back to 1994, a time of an active Austrian Black Metal Syndicate and an incognito project known as Vuzem. He joined forces with drummer Mike Gröger (Collapse 7, Bloo Vodoo, Only Attitude Counts, Mudbreed). At the urging of A.B.M.S. members, Martin Schirenc anonymously included two Vuzem tracks on self-produced compilation Norici Obscura Pars. Following favorable reviews and multiple requests, Martin decided to release a full- length recording of Vuzem's music. Other commitments, however, delayed the realization of this endeavor until late 1998, when unfinished material was brought to the attention of Napalm Records. Shortly thereafter, Vuzem signed to the label, releasing critically acclaimed debut Domus Mundi in 1999 under the Hollenthon banner. In June 2001, Hollenthon released With Vilest of Worms to Dwell. Not unlike its predecessor, it boasted a superb soundtrack-like production, as well as a fierce and wicked atmosphere created by a perfect symbiosis of heavy guitars, symphonic interludes, thrilling choirs, and bewitching melodies with samples from classical composers like i.e. Sergei Prokofiev (\\"Montagues and Capulets\\" from Romeo and Juliet in \\"Lords of Bedlam\\"). The album was promoted with a European tour together with Eisregen (GER) and Siebenbürgen (SWE). The live line up was completed with Mike's bandmates Mario Klausner (Collapse 7, Ex-Pungent Stench, Ex-Belphegor) and Werner Freinbichler (Collapse 7). The following years saw Martin concentrating on Pungent Stench although the writing of new material was never stopped. 2007 Hollenthon intended to return and continue to walk the chosen path. Wanting a real band and not just additional live musicians Martin and Mike chose to recruit Gregor Marboe, who Martin shared stages with since early 2006 in Pungent Stench on bass and backing vocals and who has been active in the Austrian scene for years in his bands Defender Kfs and Vargsriket. In need of a second guitarist Martin Arzberger (Molokh, Defender Kfs) was introduced to the band.

It was a medium-sized, ground-dwelling, bipedal herbivore that represents the third therizinosaur taxon from the Bayan Shireh Formation, although it is known from the lower part. The genus is monotypic, including only the type species E. mongoliensis, known from a well preserved pelvis and other tentative body remains. Discovery and naming Fossil localities in Mongolia. Locality of Enigmosaurus in Khara Khutul, at Area D The holotype, IGM 100/84, was discovered at the Khara Khutul locality in the Bayan Shireh Formation (sometimes called Baynshire Formation or the Baynshirenskaya Svita), southeastern Mongolia, dating from the Late Cretaceous period, and first reported in 1979 on a pelvic comparison with other theropod dinosaurs. At the time, little was known about therizinosaurs. In 1980, it was mentioned again, this time in the new infraorder created by the mongolian paleontologists Rinchen Barsbold and Altangerel Perle: Segnosauria. Nicknamed as the \\"Dinosaur from Khara Khutul\\", it was shortly described and included into the Segnosauria. Schematic reconstruction of the pelvis Three years later, the type species, Enigmosaurus mongoliensis, was named and described in 1983 by Barsbold. The preserved elements consist of a partial skeleton, lacking the skull, that includes a well preserved pelvic girdle with other postcrania. The generic name, Enigmosaurus, was stated to be derived from Greek αίνιγμα (aínigma, meaning enigma) and σαῦρος (sauros, meaning lizard), in reference to the aberratic and unusual shape of its pelvis. The specific name, mongoliensis, refers to the country of its discovery, Mongolia. Translated paper Some therizinosaur fossil findings at the Iren Dabasu Formation were first thought to be referable to Enigmosaurus. Although it is commonly known from the pelvis, several remains not mentioned in the original description of the holotype were labelled under the same specimen number (IGM 100/84). These elements are in poor condition compared to the pelvis, and they were not measured and illustrated: proximal end of a femur; large femoral shaft, might be a tibial shaft; some ribs; distal end of a humerus; a tentative radius and the proximal end of an ulna. The femur however, was not found in association with the holotype individual, therefore it should be assigned to therizinosauria incertae sedis; the other remains might pertain to the holotype. A very large left femur, measuring long, was labelled with the same specimen number too, however, it was not associated with the holotype due to its large size (larger than the pelvis itself). Nevertheless, it seems to approach the size of the closer Segnosaurus. =Possible synonymy with Erlikosaurus= Some paleontologists proposed that Enigmosaurus was likely the same animal as Erlikosaurus, since both were found in the same geologic formation, Enigmosaurus is known from pelvic remains, whereas the pelvis of Erlikosaurus is unknown and distinguishing traits between them were absent; if proven, this would make Enigmosaurus a junior synonym of Erlikosaurus. However, the Enigmosaurus pelvis doesn't resemble that of Segnosaurus as would be expected for the connection with Erlikosaurus, and there is a huge size difference. In addition, both genera are known from different strata (lower and upper), and they are considered to be distinct animals by most authors. Description Diagram of the sacrum, in A ventral and B dorsal views Enigmosaurus was a relatively large-bodied therizinosaur, with an estimated length of and a weight between . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information As noted by Barsbold in the original description of Enigmosaurus, it can recognised by the following characteristics: the pubis and ischium are short; elongated margin in the anterior presymphyseal region of the distal pubis. However, in the revised diagnosis by Zanno et al. 2010, there are even more specific traits for Enigmosaurus that were not pointed out/analyzed before: prominent cranial and caudal processes on the dorsoventrally somewhat flattened pubic boot; the pubic feet are fused, being medially elongated, a medial expansion forms a V-shaped structure; the medial fusion of the obturator process and pubic body, forms a tetraradiate process. Life restoration The holotype pelvis is in relatively good preservation, compromising the sacral vertebrae, partial illium, right and left pubis and the left ischium. The pelvis is somewhat large as a whole and opisthopubic. The illium is widely positioned and turned externally; it preserves a large cubic process in the posterodorsal area. Elongated pubic peduncles are present in the illium; the ischial peduncles are more reduced though. The distal end of the pubis is elongated, recurved and stocky. The ischium, is slightly shorter than the pubis and parallel to it, with a narrow shaft. The obturator process on the front edge of the ischium is horizontally elongated and low. Open edges are appreciable on the large trochanteric fossa. Apparently, the sacrum preserves six vertebrae, with elongated transverse processes. For instance, its pelvis is very particular compared to other therizinosaur relatives, featuring areas of bone resorption and bone remodeling on the illium. These specific traits may indicate the advanced age of the individual, if true, the fusion of the obturator process and pubic body could be discarded as an authentic autapomorphy for the species. Zanno noted that more analyses are required to settle this enigma. Classification Enigmosaurus was by the describers assigned to a separate Enigmosauridae (now obsolete) due to its aberrant pelvis, but later considered a member of the Segnosauridae which are today called the Therizinosauridae. Lindsay Zanno in 2010 recovered a position more basal in the Therizinosauroidea. Hip variation among therizinosaur genera Below are the results of the recently performed phylogenetic analysis of the Therizinosauria by Hartman et al. 2019, in which Enigmosaurus is recovered as a derived therizinosauroid. Paleoecology Enigmosaurus and the known Dinosauria from the Bayan Shireh Formation (Enigmosaurus in yellow, first from left) The remains of Enigmosaurus were found in sediments that were deposited during the Late Cretaceous period on the Bayan Shireh Formation, Khara Khutul locality, about 95.9 ± 6.0 million to 89.6 ± 4.0 million years ago, Cenomanian-Santonian ages. Being a therizinosaur, it was likely a slow herbivore and/or omnivore, as suggested by most authors all over the time. The biodiversity across the formation was characterized by therizinosaurs, as seen on the remains of Enigmosaurus, Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus. The holotype location, Khara Khutul, has also yielded the contemporary Segnosaurus and an unnamed velociraptorine. Most of the remaining paleofauna from this formation is known from Upper strata, whereas Enigmosaurus is known from Lower strata. At the locality, diverse paleoflora has been discovered, such as Cornaceae reported with Bothrocaryum gobience and Nyssoidea mongolica as fine representatives. Numerous fossil fruits findings at the locality reflect the large presence of angiosperm plants on the formation. The unearthed fruits bear some resemblance with Abelmoschus esculentus, however, definitive taxonomic affinities are quite unclear.
