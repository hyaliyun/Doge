Early life Servetseza Kadƒ±n was born on 1 September 1823 in Maykop, Yegeruqwai Princedom of Circassia. She was a member of the Circassian princely family of House of Temyryko () of princedom of Kabardia of Circassia. Her father was Prince Temyryko Mansur and her mother belonged to the Principality of Dadeshkeliani. She had two elder siblings, a brother Prince Andok Bey (1818 ‚Äì 1886) and a sister, Princess Fatma ≈ûemsfer Hanƒ±m (1821 ‚Äì 1855), and a younger brother Prince S√ºleyman Bey (16 March 1825 ‚Äì 1896). Marriage When Abdulmejid ascended the throne, after the death of his father on 2 July 1839, Esma Sultan, daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid I, in whose household Servetseza had served, selected her as a consort for her nephew, the new Sultan. The marriage took place in 1839, and Servetseza became his principal consort with the title of \\"Senior Consort\\" directly after the wedding, a position at which she remained throughout his entire reign. The marriage strengthened the relations between the two dynasties. After the wedding, Abdulmejid made her sister, ≈ûemsfer Hanƒ±m, treasurer in the imperial harem. Leyla Achba, writes in her memoirs that she was an intelligent and a well cultured lady. Charles White, who visited Istanbul in 1843, said following about her: Servetseza remained childless. After G√ºlcemal Kadƒ±n's death in 1851, her children, Fatma Sultan, Refia Sultan and ≈ûehzade Mehmed Re≈üad (future Mehmed V) were entrusted in her care. She had asked Abdulmejid to take the motherless children under her wing, and raise as her own, and carried out the duties of a mother who cares for her children with compassion and concern. When Bezmi√¢lem Sultan died in 1853, Servetseza was placed incharge of Abdulmejid's harem. Upon this occasion, ≈ûevkefza Kadƒ±n took courage of Servetseza Kadƒ±n's affection for heir ≈ûehzade Mehmed Murad (future Sultan Murad V) and Abdulmejid's wish to see his son as the next Sultan, and rose in opposition to Pertevniyal Sultan and her son ≈ûehzade Abdulaziz (the future Sultan Abdulaziz). Widowhood, death and aftermath After Abdulmejid's death on 25 June 1861, and the accession of his younger brother, Sultan Abdulaziz, Servetseza settled in the Kabata≈ü Palace. In 1872, she commissioned a fountain in the courtyard of √ñzbekler Tekke in √úsk√ºdar. She was apparently very fond of Murad, and after his deposition in 1876, she indiscreetly told many people that Abdul Hamid II had usurped the throne from him. Servetseza died on 25 September 1878 at the age of fifty five, and was buried near the mausoleum of her husband at the Yavuz Selim Mosque, Istanbul. It is believed by some that she was murdered. One night in Ramadan she is said to have gone to Abdul Hamid and warned him. She ordered him to give the throne back to it to its rightful owner. After pretending to heed her warning, he arranged that she be served with a poisoned drink. She died upon her return to her palace. Servetseza had been greatly benefited from her husband, Abdulmejid, and so the processions she bequeathed amounted to a great sum in value, especially her jewels. For this reason, Abdul Hamid didn't surrendered them to Re≈üad, and had her jewels brought to the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace for safekeeping along with two large trunks of her things. However, after Abdul Hamid was deposed in 1909, all the jewels and trunks were returned to the newly enthroned Sultan Mehmed Re≈üad.

In order to provide a dynamic response, reconfigurable antennas integrate an inner mechanism (such as RF switches, varactors, mechanical actuators or tunable materials) that enable the intentional redistribution of the RF currents over the antenna surface and produce reversible modifications of its properties. Reconfigurable antennas differ from smart antennas because the reconfiguration mechanism lies inside the antenna, rather than in an external beamforming network. The reconfiguration capability of reconfigurable antennas is used to maximize the antenna performance in a changing scenario or to satisfy changing operating requirements.  Types of antenna reconfiguration  Reconfigurable antennas can be classified according to the antenna parameter that is dynamically adjusted, typically the frequency of operation, radiation pattern or polarization. = Frequency reconfiguration = Frequency reconfigurable antennas can adjust their frequency of operation dynamically. They are particularly useful in situations where several communications systems converge because the multiple antennas required can be replaced by a single reconfigurable antenna. Frequency reconfiguration is generally achieved by physical or electrical modifications to the antenna dimensions using RF-switches, impedance loading or tunable materials. = Radiation pattern reconfiguration = Radiation pattern reconfigurability is based on the intentional modification of the spherical distribution of the radiation pattern. Beam steering is the most extended application and consists of steering the direction of maximum radiation to maximize the antenna gain in a link with mobile devices. Pattern reconfigurable antennas are usually designed using movable/rotatable structures or switchable and reactively- loaded parasitic elements. In the last 10 years, metamaterial-based reconfigurable antennas have gained attention due their small form factor, wide beam steering range and wireless applications. Plasma antennas have also been investigated as alternatives with tunable directivities. = Polarization reconfiguration = Polarization reconfigurable antennas are capable of switching between different polarization modes. The capability of switching between horizontal, vertical and circular polarizations can be used to reduce polarization mismatch losses in portable devices. Polarization reconfigurability can be provided by changing the balance between the different modes of a multimode structure. = Compound reconfiguration = Compound reconfiguration is the capability of simultaneously tuning several antenna parameters, for instance frequency and radiation pattern. The most common application of compound reconfiguration is the combination of frequency agility and beam-scanning to provide improved spectral efficiencies. Compound reconfigurability is achieved by combining in the same structure different single-parameter reconfiguration techniques or by reshaping dynamically a pixel surface.  Reconfiguration techniques There are different types of reconfiguration techniques for antennas. Mainly they are electrical (for example using RF-MEMS, PIN diodes, or varactors), optical, physical (mainly mechanical), and using materials. For the reconfiguration techniques using materials, the materials could be solid, liquid crustal, liquids (dielectric liquid or liquid metal).

Built in the 1880s, the house was the first municipal hall of Las Pi√±as where its first mayor, Juan Tiongkiao, held office from 1905 to 1913. Along with its growth, the seat of power of Las Pi√±as continued to adapt with several changes as well. History Don Calixto Lara, who used to own salt beds and lands, and his wife Andeng Velasquez were the original owners of the house. Don Calixto Lara was one of the 95 men that gathered and assembled for the Act of Philippine Declaration of Independence, signed by the War Counsellor and Special Delegate-Designate, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista. Don Calixto together with his brothers Pedro and Bernardo Lara have worked on the famous Las Pinas Bamboo Organ for repairsHelen Samson-Lauterwald:The Bamboo Organ of Las Pinas p.132 Francesca Lara, daughter of Calixto Lara, was only 16 years old when the house was built. Her brothers, Cirpriano Lara, has lineage to Charlene Gonzales (Bb. Pilipinas-Universe 1994 and a finalist in the 1994 Miss Universe Pageant held in Manila) while Elioterio Lara worked as clerk in Cuartel Master located in Intramuros, Manila. Her husband was Graciano Santos. They were the grandparents of the current owner. Trinidad Santos, daughter of Graciano Santos, was born on June 1, 1903. Her husband was Agrifino Trajano from Pasay (formerly Pineda). They were the parents of the current owner. Laura Trajano, born on June 30, 1931, was the current co-owner and occupant of the ancestral house. Transition of the functions of the Municipal Hall =From Old Municipal Hall to Las Pi√±as District Hospital= Another view of Las Pi√±as General Hospital and Satellite Trauma Center Another view of Las Pi√±as General Hospital and Satellite Trauma Center After serving its function at the Lara House, the administration was transferred into the former municipal library of the poblacion located at Daniel Fajardo. It was later converted into Las Pi√±as Emergency Hospital. The Las Pi√±as Emergency Hospital was established in 1977. It formally began as an Out-Patient Clinic. In 1984, former Mayor Filemon Aguilar upgraded the facility into the Las Pi√±as District Hospital by moving at another site, presently located in Bernabe Compound, Pulanglupa in 1988. From 25-bed capacity, the Las Pi√±as District Hospital could then accommodate 50-bed capacity. Front facade of the New Las Pi√±as City Hall =From Las Pi√±as District Hospital to Las Pi√±as General Hospital and Satellite Trauma Center= In response to the needs of the rising population growth rate, Republic Act No. 9240, whose principal sponsor was Representative Cynthia Villar was approved on February 10, 2004. The Act provided for the increase in bed capacity of the Las Pi√±as District Hospital from fifty (50) to two hundred (200) beds. The 400% increase in bed capacity would be implemented gradually over a three (3) year period. =Las Pi√±as City Hall= At present, the seat of administration of Las Pi√±as is located at the Las Pi√±as City Hall (Pamahalaang Lungsod ng Las Pi√±as) located along Alabang‚ÄìZapote Road. It was constructed during the second term of Mayor Nene Aguilar. Description =Architectural characteristics= Front of Lara House Left-Side of Lara House The Lara House is a Post and Lintel Type of construction. Wood posts were located at the ground floor - reaching up to the second floor. It reflects Second Transition Post-1860s Bahay na Bato Quadrant Style. With its predecessor, the First Transition Pre-1860s (which uses clay roofing tiles), the said style integrated galvanized (G.I.) roofing with thick gauge, second floor made of wood, and ground floor made of adobe stone. It is a single detached structure with an L-configuration plan. One of its unique architectural features was its three-paneled wooden door located at the second floor. The ground floor served as silong ‚Äì laid with concrete flooring. Glass jalousies, steel bars, and grill doors were also located. The termination of full-height adobe walls was adorned with round-edge cornice. The second floor, which catered residential uses before, was laid with wide wood planks. Wooden door panels, and sliding capiz shell windows and persianas (wooden louvers) were also located. Some decorative elements at the second floor includes wood beveling, ventanilla, capsule-shaped design in the center panels, diagonal lattice espejo (clerestory), and pilasters with moldings. Right-Side of Lara House Present situation At present, the ground floor of the Lara House was utilized into a mixed use - residential occupancy and a barber shop. A grilled gate replaced the front door. The other parts of the house were disintegrated. Additional works were also conducted such as overlaying of concrete hollow blocks and cement finishes. Several tarpaulins were also posted within the front facade of the house. Electrical wiring, accumulation of black deposits, and nearby vegetation present problems as well.

Situated at an elevation of , its walls are almost perpendicular. It measures in length, connecting the upper and lower valleys of Lowe River. Geography View north along the Lowe River into the narrowest sections of Keystone Canyon with Bridal Veil Falls dropping to the Lowe. In Keystone Canyon, the mother rock of the country shows up to good advantage. It is all slate. Its cleavage is nearly vertical and easy to drill, except where small seams of quartz exist. The slate rock on the south side of the summit is firm and solid as a rule, but on the north side it is very much disintegrated. The bed of the canyon varies from in width. The vegetation growing on the low bottoms, consisting of grass, brush, and trees, indicates that, as a rule, the water does not rise more than in nearly the whole length of the canyon. Keystone Canyon is entered by going through a low pass in a spur divide, which forms the west side of the mouth of the canyon. The east wall is more abrupt than the west wall. There is but little side drainage to the canyon, and this is easily provided for by small culverts, with the exception of Waterfall Creek. This little stream forms a cascade with falls of several hundred feet in height, and finally buries itself in the loose rock at the base of the canyon wall. For a quarter of a mile, about the middle of the canyon, narrows are formed by the side walls being nearer together; there are abrupt walls in height. At the head of the canyon the river, dashing against a perpendicular wall of rock, is sharply deflected to the left for , and then gradually assumes its general direction, which it follows closely to the mouth of the canyon. Horsetail Falls and Bridal Veil Falls are located within the canyon, as is the Richardson Highway. The Valdez- Eagle Trail passes through the canyon's south end. History It was named by William R. Abercrombie after the \\"Keystone State\\" of Pennsylvania. Features Horsetail Falls =Waterfalls= There are numerous small waterfalls in the canyon, and two more spectacular ones: Horsetail Falls is a picturesque waterfall that flows into the Lowe River. The waterfall can be seen and photographed from a road turnout along the Richardson Highway 13 miles from Valdez, Alaska. Bridal Veil Falls Bridal Veil Falls can be viewed from a turnout at about north of Horsetail Falls.

Nine different companies hoped to complete a railroad to the interior of Alaska. The only remaining sign of these efforts in Keystone Canyon is a short section of hand-cut tunnel. A feud developed and a gunfight ensued, after which the effort was abandoned. The silent movie The Iron Trail is about this era.

It airs on Saturday mornings on the owned-and-operated stations and affiliates of The CW, the block features live- action documentary and lifestyle series aimed at preteens and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 16, the same style of programming that Litton provides for competing blocks seen on ABC, CBS, and NBC. All of the programs in the three-hour block are designed to meet federally mandated educational programming guidelines. History Between May 31, 2014 and June 5, 2014, The CW announced that it would discontinue its existing Saturday morning block Vortexx, which was produced by Saban Brands, in favor of One Magnificent Morning, a new, five-hour block produced by Litton Entertainment and distributed by CBS Television Distribution, that would feature live-action educational programming aimed towards teenagers and their parents. The move came as part of a growing shift by broadcast television networks towards non- fiction programming to fulfill the FCC-mandated requirement to air a quota of educational programming weekly. The previous year, Litton began producing CBS Dream Team, a similar E/I block for sister network CBS (corporate parent CBS Corporation is a part-owner of The CW), and the company has also produced Litton's Weekend Adventure for ABC's affiliates since September 3, 2011. Vortexx aired for the final time on September 27, 2014. It was the conclusive Saturday morning block across the major U.S. commercial broadcast networks that primarily featured non-educational children's programming. Such content has gradually fallen out of favor because of the E/I rules, as well as shifts in viewing habits towards cable networks and online video on demand services for cartoons and other youth-oriented content. One Magnificent Morning debuted the following week on October 4, 2014, following the discontinuation of Vortexx in its 7:00 a.m. to Noon timeslot. As a consequence of the block launching three weeks after the traditional start of the syndication television season, Litton provided a temporary barter package of Everyday Health and Culture Click (which both formerly aired on Litton's Weekend Adventure) to CW stations, allowing those who depended on the OMM block to fulfill E/I guidelines to have programming before it started. Some initially announced shows that were not produced for the block were: America's Flavors, Social Media Mania, Swag, and Taste of Home. On January 7, 2016, The CW and Litton announced a five-year renewal for the block, extending it through the 2020-21 broadcast season. On October 7, 2017, the block's running time was reduced to three hours and began airing from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. The CW then gave the two hours of reclaimed time to the affiliates. Programming Although One Magnificent Morning provides the three-hour minimum requirement of E/I programming each week, which exceeds defined under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s Children's Television Act, some of The CW's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates continue to provide E/I-compliant programs acquired from the syndication market, mainly due to existing program distribution contracts. The CW Plus, in particular, continues to supply two hours of E/I-compliant syndicated programs within its national schedule following the block on Saturday afternoons, which further alleviates the service's subscription-subchannel affiliates from the responsibility of purchasing the local rights to such programs (the service's carriage of seven hours of E/I-compliant programming, and the fact that most of its affiliates operate as subchannels, allow The CW Plus's broadcast outlets to carry an additional subchannel without E/I interruptions under the Children's Television Act's programming regulations, as the local CW Plus outlet would have enough E/I content to cover both). =Current programming= This Old House: Trade School (October 7, 2017 - present) * Tails Of Valor (October 3, 2020 - present) * Jewels of the Natural World (July 4, 2020 - present)https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Scoop-Upcoming-Storylines- for-ONE-MAGNIFICENT-MORNING-on-THE-CW-Saturday-July-4-2020-20200702 *Jack Hanna's Into the Wild (October 5, 2019 - present) =Former programming= The Brady Barr Experience (October 4, 2014 - December 27, 2014) * Reluctantly Healthy (October 4, 2014 - December 27, 2014) * Expedition Wild (October 4, 2014 - September 26, 2015) * Rock the Park (October 4, 2014 - September 26, 2015) (currently airs as part of Litton's Weekend Adventure) * Dog Town, USA (July 4, 2015 - September 24, 2016) * Dream Quest (October 3, 2015 - September 24, 2016) * Hatched (October 3, 2015 - September 24, 2016) * Rescue Me with Dr. Lisa (October 1, 2016 - December 31, 2016) * Dinner Spinner (October 1, 2016 - March 25, 2017) * Calling Dr. Pol (October 4, 2014 - September 30, 2017) * Save Our Shelter (October 3, 2015 - September 30, 2017) * Unlikely Animal Friends (October 1, 2016 - October 29, 2016 and April 1, 2017 - September 30, 2017) * Vacation Creation (October 1, 2016 - September 30, 2017) * Save to Win (November 5, 2016 - September 30, 2017) * Brain Games: Family Edition (October 7, 2017 - December 30, 2017) * Dog Whisperer: Family Edition (October 4, 2014 - September 29, 2018) * Did I Mention Invention?

In addition to its legislative function, the House of Lords also served as a court of last resort for appeals of the decisions of lower courts on matters of interpretation of British law, with such matters decided by its Appellate Committee, drawn from those members who qualified as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.Brice Dickson and Gavin Drewry, The Judicial House of Lords: 1876-2009 (Oxford University Press, 2009) p135 That function would be superseded in 2009 by the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Lord Gardiner articulated the conclusion that he and other members had reached, that the London Tramways decision regarding stare decisis, which had restricted the Court from departing from prior rulings since 1898, would no longer bind the Lords. Gardiner reiterated the importance of precedent \\"as an indispensable foundation upon which to decide what is law and its application to individual cases,\\" but added \\"Their Lordships nevertheless recognise that too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law. They propose therefore to modify their present practice and, while treating former decisions of this House as normally binding, to depart from a decision when it appears right to do so.\\" Michael Zander, The Law-Making Process (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015) *After refusing to resign from his position as Prime Minister of Sudan, Muhammad Ahmad Mahgoub was forced to step down following a vote of censure by the Constituent Assembly.

Trams on former Lines 88/89 (but not Line 84) ran from 05:30 until 19:00, and had train frequencies of: * Every 30 minutes on weekdays. * Every 1 hour on weekends. These lines operated before the full opening of the 'central loop' of the Charleroi Metro in central Charleroi in 2012, which led to the inauguration of the currently operating Charleroi Metro lines M1, M2, and M4 (and a year later, in 2013, line M3).  Line 54  Waterloo station (2009). Sud station (2010). Line 54 was a line on the Charleroi Premetro in Belgium operated by TEC Charleroi, running from Charleroi-South railway station (aka. Sud), in downtown Charleroi, to Gilly (part of the municipality of Charleroi), via the western part of the downtown loop. Line 54 was inaugurated on 28 August 1992 and was the first to use the Gilly branch of the Charleroi Premetro network when it opened in 1992. It remained the sole line to operate on that branch until the opening of Line 55 in 1996. Line 54 had a length of , all on premetro infrastructure, and included 8 stations.

Line 84  Line 84 was a special line on the Charleroi Premetro in Belgium operated by TEC Charleroi, running from Anderlues (west of Charleroi) to Gilly (northeast), via the northwestern part of the downtown loop. Line 84 was a hybrid between Lines 88/89 and Line 54. Its itinerary used only premetro infrastructure to allow service by two trams coupled together, which was not feasible on the tram section of Lines 88/89 in Anderlues. For this reason, Line 84 was limited to terminating at P√©tria station in Anderlues. Line 84 was a special morning rush hour line, operating only one service a day (departing P√©tria at 07:29, only on school days), aimed at reducing morning congestion on Lines 88/89 and provide a direct line between western Charleroi and the north/northeastern part of downtown Charleroi where some important schools are located.

Line 88 was inaugurated on 30 August 1996, together with the Waterloo-Parc section of the downtown loop. It was created to duplicate the existing Line 89 between Anderlues and Beaux-Arts, but taking the downtown loop to the North at Beaux-Arts (as opposed to traveling to the South for Line 89). Line 88 had a length of , of which were a standard tramline with in-street running (at the Anderlues end), with the remainder of the line running on premetro infrastructure. It had 14 premetro stations and 6 tram stops, and was the longest line of the Charleroi Premetro network along with Line 89.

Line 89 existed before the first stations of the Charleroi Premetro were inaugurated in 1976, as an SNCV tramline linking Charleroi and Anderlues. It became a premetro line in phases, starting in 1976, as more premetro stations were added to the network. The Line 89 version of this tramline started its service in 1992. Line 89 followed the same itinerary as Line 88 between Anderlues and Beaux-Arts, but took the (then- partial) downtown loop to the South at Beaux-Arts (as opposed to traveling to the North for Line 88).

It is an altcoin that was forked from the Bitcoin protocol. It is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) run by a subset of its users, which are called \\"masternodes\\". The currency permits transactions that can be untraceable. History The currency was launched in January 2014 as \\"Xcoin\\" by Evan Duffield, as a fork of the Bitcoin protocol. It is an altcoin and in its early days it was subject to pump and dump speculation. It was rebranded as Darkcoin, which received press for being used in dark net markets. In March 2015, it rebranded again with the name Dash as a portmanteau of 'digital cash'. As of August 2016, Dash is no longer used in any major dark net markets worth noting. In early 2017 Duffield, who lived in the Phoenix area, and some other people working on Dash took space in a business incubator at Arizona State University. The Dash DAO later funded a blockchain research lab at ASU. , Dash's market capitalization was around $4.3 billion and it was one of the top 12 cryptocurrencies. , Dash was the most popular cryptocurrency in Venezuela according to Der Spiegel. Design and governance Dash was designed to allow transactions quickly and to have a swift governance structure in order to overcome shortfalls in Bitcoin. =Governance= Governance is handled through a form of decentralized autonomous organization in which decisions are made on a blockchain via masternodes. Masternodes perform standard node functions like hosting a copy of the blockchain, relaying messages, and validating transactions on the network, and in addition act as shareholders, voting on proposals for improving Dash's ecosystem. Along with masternodes, the system includes standard nodes and miners. Running a masternode requires ownership of 1000 Dash. Masternodes are also required to have a static IP address and meet minimum requirements for CPU, RAM, disk space and network bandwidth. A proof of service protocol ensures that masternodes have the most current blockchain protocol and are online. The system's decentralization has been criticized due to a mishap, which allowed too many coins to be distributed at release. This concentrated the wealth to a small group, giving them disproportionate power in decisions over the currency‚Äôs future. =Consensus= As of 2018 coins were mined using a proof of work algorithm with a hash function called \\"X11\\", with eleven rounds of hashing, and the average time to mine a coin was around two and a half minutes. =Transactions= Masternodes provide two additional kinds of transactions. \\"InstantSend\\" bypasses mining and instead requires a consensus of masternodes to validate a transaction, speeding transactions. \\"PrivateSend\\" is intended to make transactions untraceable; it mixes participating users' unspent Dash before executing a transaction. In 2018 the e-commerce payment system company Alt Thirty Six (Alternative36, Inc.) began offering electronic payments in Dash for companies in the legal cannabis industry in the United States. Dash-funded organizations The Dash DAO uses the 10% it receives from mining to invest as the DAO chooses, using a decentralised voting system. This has allowed the creation of many funded organizations, including Dash Core Group, Inc. (DCG), which supports continued development, integrations, and other activities of Dash.

The lands that became Oakland Manor were patented by John Dorsey as \\"Dorsey's Adventure\\" in 1688 which was willed to his grandson Edward Dorsey. In 1785, Luther Martin purchased properties named \\"Dorsey's Adventure\\", \\"Dorsey's Inheritance\\", \\"Good for Little\\", \\"Chew's Vineyard\\", and \\"Adam the First\\" to make the 2300 acre \\"Luther Martin's Elkridge Farm\\". Background In 1785, John Sterrett purchased 1,626 wooded acres with several buildings named \\"Felicity\\" from Mathias Hammond, a participant in the 1774 sinking of the Peggy Stewart. Sterrett died two years later, with his wife Deborah Ridgely Sterrett selling 567 acres of the property to their son Charles Sterrett Ridgely, and 533 acres to his brother James Sterrett. Charles Sterrett Ridgely was born Charles Ridgely Sterrett, but changed his name to inherit from his maternal great uncle. He was a graduate of St. Johns College in 1802, a future Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates, and commissioned the manor house in June 1810. The house was completed in 1811 including a 100 ft-long stone carriage house. To the east of the Manor, a grist mill was built which stayed in production until being demolished by fire in 1890. The site known as \\"Oakland Mills\\" served as a postal stop, and the name was later used for one of the Rouse development company villages. Charles Sterrett Ridgely forfeited the house in 1826, selling it to Robert Oliver for $47,000 after failing to make payments toward the property. His son Thomas Oliver purchased the manor, expanding it to 775 acres by adding \\"Talbot's Resolution Manor\\",\\"Howard's Fair and Amicable Settlement\\", \\"Josephs Gift\\", \\"Dorseys Search Resurveyed\\" and \\"Dorseys Search\\". Stone outbuildings with a capability for 1200 bushels of ice were constructed. He sold it for $58,459.95 in 1838 to George Riggs Gaither, who operated the manor as a productive slave plantation producing wheat, corn, oats and hay. The nearby \\"Oakland Mill\\" operated as \\"Gaither's Mill\\". A small granite quarry was also operated by the plantation. George Riggs Gaither built the stone \\"Bleak House\\" on the property for his son, George Riggs Gaither Jr. As the civil war approached, Gaither formed \\"Gaithers Raiders\\" part of the \\"Howard County Dragoons\\", sixty men which practiced at Oakland Manor prior to becoming a confederate army unit furnished by Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks. The troops marched on 19 April 1861 through Ellicott City to Baltimore, responding to the Baltimore riot of 1861, before heading South to join J. E. B. Stuart. In October 1862, six Union troops from New Jersey raided the Oakland Manor as a Southern sympathizing plantation with the owners joining the Confederate Army. The farm was sold again after the Civil War to Phillip and Katherine Tabb who switched from slave farming to raising thoroughbreds with a half mile oval track situated along Columbia pike. In 1874, Katherine Tabb's father Francis Morris of New York purchased Oakland, testing corn silage and trenching techniques that gave Oakland an agricultural engineering status from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers. Five trench 117 ft long silos were put to use onsite. In 1877, Morris began a significant grounds improvement program removing Hawthorn hedges and replacing them with wood fencing throughout the property manufactured at the Oakland Mills sawmill. The property had been subdivided to 406 acres in 1909 by owner Thomas Findlay, who removed the racetrack. Oakland was reduced to 350 acres by 1921 with one 8-room tenant house. From 1950 to 1966 the property was operated by Miriam J. Keller as the Oakland Manor Health Farm. After divorce proceedings, the property became the most important land purchase for Rouse Company development project of Columbia. Attorney Bernard F. Goldberg negotiated the deal early in his career before his prison term for misappropriation of land development funds. In 1966, the Rouse Company purchased Oakland and used it as temporary headquarters, then leased it to Antioch College and Dag Hammarskj√∂ld college. By 1976, The property surrounding Oakland Manor was reduced to 8.26 acres. The building was leased to the Red Cross from 1977 to 1988. In 1988, Rouse divested itself of the property maintenance by selling Oakland to the Columbia Association for $185,000. The same year, the association leased 1060sf of the former slave plantation to the African Art Museum of Maryland.

Along with the Sitka pulp mill, the mill was built as part of a U.S. Forest Service economic development program for Southeast Alaska. Feedstock for the mill was harvested from the Tongass National Forest under guaranteed 50-year supply contracts that enabled the private companies to commit the large development investments in an area with only one log supplier (the USFS). This became controversial in the late 1980s, due to environmental concerns with the scale of old-growth forest harvesting and uninformed criticism of the alleged multimillion-dollar subsidies.

Famous high-exposure route. A technically simple, but exposed arete on the H√∂fats in Bavaria, Germany Exposure is a climbing and hiking term. Sections of a hiking path or climbing route are described as \\"exposed\\" if there is a high risk of injury in the event of a fall because of the steepness of the terrain. If such routes are negotiated without any protection, a false step can result in a serious fall.Olaf Perwitzschky, Dieter Seibert: Bergwandern, Bergsteigen. Alpine Lehrschrift. page 71, Bergverlag Rother, Munich, 2008, (online) The negotiation of such routes can cause fear of falling because of the potential danger.  Definitions  What constitutes exposure on a path is fairly obvious, however, an \\"exposed\\" location or section of a climbing route is not uniformly or clearly defined in the literature. There are no threshold values, for example, based on the gradient of the terrain, the height of rock faces or the character of a ridge or ar√™te. Authors tend to use their own definition of the terms \\"exposure\\" or \\"exposed\\" when describing routes, for example: = Exposure = \\"The distance from the climber to where the climber would likely stop in the event of an unprotected fall.\\"Glossary of rock, ice and mountain climbing terms by the Santiam Alpine Club.

Medical and psychological aspects  \\"Exposed\\" sections of a path or a route can cause fear as well as serious problems for climbers and walkers in mountainous terrain if they lack a head for heights. However, what may feel exposed to some people, may hardly affect others at all. In critical situations it is therefore necessary, either to turn back or to use a protective measure such as a rope; some paths have fixed ropes, chains, ladders, etc. The anxiety caused by the exposure reduces with habituation, but even experienced climbers often have to get used to heights again at the start of the climbing season.Pepi St√ºckl, Georg Sojer: Bergsteigen: Lehrbuch f√ºr alle Spielarten des Bergsteigens. page 26, Bruckmann, Munich, 1996,  See also  Climbing protection * Head for heights * Hiking * Scrambling * Sure-footedness * Hazards of outdoor recreation  References  Climbing Hiking Outdoor recreation Hazards ","title":"Exposure (heights)"},{"id":"42936258","text":"Original Plumbing also known as OP is a quarterly magazine focused on \\"the culture and lifestyle of transgender men.\\" The magazine was started in September 2009 in the San Francisco Bay Area, by editors-in-chief Amos Mac and Rocco Kayiatos.

The church was passed back to the Greek Catholic congregation in 2014 however the church is used for Roman Catholic and Serbian Orthodox services, respectively. History The Church of St. Nicholas was originally built in 1569 as a Byzantine Rite parish church for the Greek Orthodox Church. The Greek Catholic Church came into existence following the Union of Brest in 1595‚Äì96. In 1639, the parish priest Papas Giovanni Metaxi decided to separate from the Orthodox church and join the Greek Catholic Church, and he conceded the church to the Confraternity of the Souls in Purgatory. The church building was completely reconstructed to designs of the Baroque architect Francesco Buonamici in 1652. Relations between the parish and the Confraternity are regulated by a concordat signed on 17 September 1766. 18th-century relief about an indulgence of 40 days outside the church The church suffered considerable due to aerial bombardment during World War II. It was repaired by 1951, and the repair works included a complete reconstruction of the fa√ßade. The church formally passed back into the hands of the local Greek Catholic congregation in 2014. Today, it is used by the Roman Catholic church although authority falls under Greek Catholic hierarch Archimandrite Fr. George Mifsud Montanaro. Greek Catholic (Byzantine Rite) liturgy is celebrated daily at the nearby Church of Our Lady of Damascus. The church is also used for Sunday Divine Services by the Serbian Orthodox Church. Today, the church is a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

The game is a sequel to Pushmo and Crashmo, and was released worldwide on June 19, 2014. A sequel, Stretchmo for the Nintendo 3DS, was released in 2015. Gameplay The game plays very similarly to its predecessor, Pushmo. It features 250 puzzles, where players must pull out blocks to reach the end of the level. A new addition was the inclusion of Miiverse integration that allowed players to send their created levels online for others to play, rate, and save onto their games. It is the third game in the Pushmo series and the first released on home consoles. The player, as the round cat Mallo, rescues children from atop three-dimensional, colored block puzzles called pushmos. The player approaches a block, holds down a button, and either pulls or pushes the blocks to climb the tower. There are 250 levels. The game includes a puzzle editor (Pushmo Studio) wherein players can build their own puzzles and share them via QR code or an in-game World Pushmo Fair. Development The game was first announced May 28, 2014 for Wii U. It was created as a sequel to Pushmo on the Nintendo 3DS. The game is exclusive to the Wii U. Reception Pushmo World received generally positive reviews, scoring 82/100 on Metacritic and 81% on GameRankings. Polygon Dave Tach was new to the series, but quickly liked it. He particularly appreciated the puzzles' pacing in that he felt like he continually made positive progress and never felt hopelessly stuck. Tach said the game was not customized for the home console, but did not need to be. He rated the game 9/10.

Early life and education Smoley was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1956. He attended the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, and took a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in classics at Harvard University in 1978. Smoley went on to Oxford University, where in 1980, he received a second bachelor's degree from the Honour School of Literae Humaniores (in philosophy and classical literature). He received his M.A. from Oxford in 1985. While Smoley was at Oxford, he came in contact with a small group that was studying the Kabbalah, co-founded by the British Kabbalist and author Warren Kenton (Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi).Smoley, Richard, The Dice Game of Shiva: How Consciousness Creates the Universe. Novato, Calif.: New World Library, 2009, xiii-xxv; also Supernatural: Writings on an Unknown History. New York: Tarcher/Penguin, 2013, 7-21. Smoley subsequently started Kabbalah groups along similar lines in San Francisco, New York, and Knoxville, Tennessee. Editorships Smoley moved to San Francisco in 1980. In 1982 he began working for California Farmer magazine, the state's leading agricultural publication, and became managing editor in 1983. Smoley helped broaden the magazine's coverage to include controversial topics such as organic farming, and the California Farmer helped bring organic farming into the agricultural mainstream. Smoley left California Farmer in 1988. In the 1980s and 1990s Smoley continued his spiritual investigations, working with Tibetan Buddhism, the teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff, and A Course in Miracles. He was also a member of the board of directors of the now-defunct San Francisco Miracles Foundation, an organization sponsoring the work of A Course in Miracles. In 1986, Smoley started writing for a new magazine called Gnosis: A Journal of the Western Inner Traditions, founded in San Francisco by Jay Kinney. After four years of writing for Gnosis and a brief stint as managing editor, he came on board as editor in November 1990. In his eight years as editor of Gnosis, the magazine published issues on subjects as diverse as Gnosticism, Freemasonry, G.I. Gurdjieff, the spirituality of Russia, and psychedelics in spirituality. Smoley's interest in the Kabbalah influenced the magazine's coverage of that tradition.Hanegraaff, Wouter J, \\"Kabbalah and Gnosis Magazine: 1985-1999\\". In Boaz Huss, ed., Kabbalah and Contemporary Spiritual Revival. Beer-Sheva, Israel: Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press, 2011. In 1998 Gnosis won Utne Reader's award for best spiritual coverage. In 1999, largely for financial reasons, Gnosis ceased publication. Smoley moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he worked as guest editor for Leonardo, the journal of the International Society for the Arts Sciences and Technology, and subsequently to western Massachusetts, where he served as managing editor for the Anthroposophic Press (later renamed SteinerBooks) in Great Barrington. He briefly taught philosophy on an adjunct basis at Holyoke Community College in Holyoke, Massachusetts. In 2005 Smoley began to work as acquisitions editor for Quest Books, the publishing arm of the Theosophical Society in America. In 2008, he became editor of Quest, the journal of the Theosophical Society in America. He continues to hold both positions today. Smoley is a consulting editor to Parabola. He has served as guest editor of Science of Mind magazine, and works as a consultant for the New Century Edition of the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, sponsored by the Swedenborg Foundation in West Chester, Pennsylvania. In 2011 Smoley was elected to the board of directors of the Swedenborg Foundation. Writings Smoley's publishing career began when he was an undergraduate at Harvard. He served as managing editor of The Harvard Advocate, the university's literary magazine, in 1977. He also edited First Flowering: The Best of the Harvard Advocate, 1866-1976, a selection from the magazine that included undergraduate writings by figures such as T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, e.e. cummings, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. The collection included a foreword by the novelist Norman Mailer and a preface by the translator Robert Fitzgerald. At Oxford, Smoley helped revive the dormant magazine of Corpus Christi College, The Pelican, and published some short works in it. In May 1999, Smoley's book Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions, coauthored with Jay Kinney, was published by Penguin Arkana. A revised edition was issued by Quest Books in 2006, and an audio version was released by Audible.com in 2013. Chapters cover Carl Jung, Gnosticism, the Kabbalah, ritual magic, shamanism, alchemy, G.I. Gurdjieff, Sufism, the Rosicrucians, the Freemasons, Theosophy, and the New Age. Gustav Niebuhr, writing in the New York Times, characterized the book as \\"a new wide-ranging book about alternative spiritual paths.\\"Niebuhr, Gustav, \\"From Witches to Angels: Alternative Spirituality\\". New York Times, July 24, 1999, A10. In Whole Earth, Jeanne Carstensen commented that Hidden Wisdom displayed \\"both historical rigor and a wink toward the divine.\\"Carstensen, Jeanne, review of Hidden Wisdom. In Whole Earth, Summer 2000, 97. Smoley's second and best-known book, Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition, was published in 2002 by Shambhala Publications. An audio version read by the author was released by Berkshire Media Artists in 2003. In his introduction, Smoley says he was inspired to write this book because there were at that point no good introductions to the mystical and esoteric traditions of Christianity, a situation he attempted to remedy.Smoley, Richard, Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition. Boston: Shambhala, 2002, 7. Library Journal characterized the book as \\"a solid introduction to esoteric Christianity for the general reader.\\"Young, Steve, review of Inner Christianity.

Patrick, \\"What Was Hidden: Looking Deeper into Christianity; An Interview with Richard Smoley\\". The Sun 333, Sept. 2003, 4-13. In January 2006, Tarcher/Penguin published The Essential Nostradamus, Smoley's guide to the enigmatic prophet Michel de Nostradamus. The book contains new translations of Nostradamus's key prophecies, as well as an evaluation of his work and of prophecy in general. A second edition of this work appeared in 2011. In 2006, Harper San Francisco (now Harper One) published Smoley's book Forbidden Faith: The Gnostic Legacy from the Gospels to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". A paperback edition, retitled Forbidden Faith: The Secret History of Gnosticism, appeared in 2007. In this book Smoley traces the history of Gnostic and other esoteric currents of Western civilization ‚Äî including Manichaeism, Catharism, the Rosicrucian legacy, Freemasonry, Kabbalah, and Theosophy. It also explores how these currents have shaped modern trends and thinkers ranging from William Blake to Jung, and, in more recent times, Philip K. Dick and Harold Bloom. Smoley's book Conscious Love: Insights from Mystical Christianity, was published in April 2008 by Jossey-Bass. His discussion of consciousness, causation, and the existence of God, The Dice Game of Shiva: How Consciousness Creates the Universe, was published by New World Library in November 2009. In a review of this book for Parabola, the magazine's executive editor, Tracy Cochran, wrote, \\"With clarity and verve, [Smoley] lays out famous arguments and articulations of the conundrum of the nature of consciousness so that they sparkle like jewels on the dark velvet of starlight.\\"Cochran, Tracy, review of The Dice Game of Shiva. In Parabola 35:1 (Spring 2010), 122-23. Smoley's most recent books, The Deal: A Guide to Radical and Complete Forgiveness (2015) and Supernatural: Writings on an Unknown History (2013), were published by Tarcher/Penguin. Smoley is a frequent contributor to the Australian magazine New Dawn and he is an associate of the Institute of Cultural Inquiry, a Los Angeles-based organization devoted to cultural studies. He lectures on his work throughout the United States and occasionally abroad. Organizations that have sponsored his lectures and workshops include the Bodhi Tree bookstore (West Hollywood), the California Institute of Integral Studies (San Francisco), East-West Books (New York), the Kabbalah Society (London), the Lumen Foundation (San Francisco), the New York Open Center, the Swedenborg Foundation (West Chester, Pennsylvania), and the Theosophical Society in America (Wheaton, Illinois). Thought Smoley's books show a certain progression in that his earlier works, particularly Hidden Wisdom, are more descriptive of the ideas and teachings of others, notably those in the Western esoteric tradition, while his subsequent works, particularly Inner Christianity, Conscious Love, and The Dice Game of Shiva, are devoted to expounding his own views, which he associates primarily with esoteric, or, as he styles it, \\"inner\\" Christianity. =Esotericism= Smoley occupies a somewhat ambiguous position in regard to the academic study of esotericism, pioneered by Antoine Faivre at the Sorbonne and developed by such figures as Wouter Hanegraaff, Joscelyn Godwin, Arthur Versluis, and Nicholas Goodrick- Clarke. On the one hand, Smoley has always shown high respect for the findings of academic scholarship in the field; on the other hand, he has also shown some concern that an overacademic approach will distort and devitalize the living esoteric tradition, of which he considers himself to be a part. In a 1993 editorial in Gnosis, he wrote: > Like Rappaccini's daughter, the professors' touch can prove poisonous. I > have a degree in philosophy myself, so I have firsthand experience of how > academic hairsplitting and pettifogging disputes over the meanings of words > have all but killed that discipline. A glance into just about any > theological treatise will leave one with the same impression. So I'm not > sure that academic inquiry will really do justice to the spiritual > traditions of the West, particularly since scholastics, from the time of > Aquinas onward, have been notoriously bad at distinguishing intellectual > knowledge from the deeper, experiential understanding called \\"gnosis.\\" Even > Gershom Scholem, the great scholar of Jewish mysticism, was nicknamed \\"the > accountant\\" by kabbalists because they saw his knowledge as being merely of > the intellectual kind.Smoley, Richard, editorial, Gnosis 28 (summer 1993), > 1. Smoley elaborated on these comments in a 2006 address to the Association for the Study of Esotericism entitled \\"Academe and Esotericism: The Problem of Authority.\\"Smoley, Richard, ‚ÄúAcademe and Esotericism: The Problem of Authority‚Äù, 'Alpheus website, accessed May 22, 2014. In terms of the distinction between the emics, who consider themselves to be part of the culture in question, and the etics, such as anthropologists, who study the culture from an outside, ostensibly objective view, Smoley is an etically informed emic. His view of esotericism holds that it is not so much a matter of entering an inner circle of adepts but of going \\"further in\\" oneself in order to grasp deeper levels of consciousness. The various esoteric traditions would, then, serve as ways of making this journey within. =Consciousness= Smoley's metaphysics and epistemology are intricately intertwined. His approach can be described as partially phenomenological, although he does not appear to be directly influenced by 20th-century phenomenologists such as Edmund Husserl or Maurice Merleau-Ponty. He posits a fundamental dichotomy that underlies the rest of his thought: between what he calls the \\"self\\" and the \\"other.\\" His theory of consciousness rests on this polarity; in fact he defines consciousness as \\"that which relates self and other.\\" In his 2009 work The Dice Game of Shiva, Smoley, drawing inspiration from the Hindu philosophical school known as the Samkhya, equates this self and other with the terms purusha and prakriti respectively. Consciousness in this sense extends far past waking human awareness, which Smoley sees as only one level of a continuum that also includes the consciousness of other living beings as well as the inanimate world down to at least the atomic level. To this effect he quotes an 1890 interview with Thomas Edison: > \\"I do not believe,\\" [Edison] said, \\"that matter is inert, acted upon by an > outside force. To me it seems that every atom is possessed by a certain > amount of primitive intelligence. Look at the thousands of ways in which > atoms of hydrogen combine with those of other elements, forming the most > diverse substances. Do you mean to say that they do this without > intelligence?. ... Gathered together in certain forms, the atoms constitute > animals of the lower orders. Finally they combine in man, who represents the > total intelligence of all the atoms.\\"Lathrop, George Parsons. \\"Talks with > Edison.\\" Harper's New Monthly Magazine 80:477 (Feb. 1890), 435; quoted in > Smoley, The Dice Game of Shiva, 15. Smoley adds, \\"If an atom could not take a stance in the physical world and draw a line between itself and what is not itself, it could not exist.\\" =The Human Self= Smoley characterizes human consciousness in terms of his contrast of self and other. In this case, however, he uses slightly different terminology, often speaking of \\"I\\" and \\"the world.\\" The \\"I,\\" or \\"true I\\" (he uses both expressions), in his view, is not the ordinary ego but a deeper, transpersonal entity that simply sees or experiences. He explicitly equates this \\"I\\" with a number of concepts from the world's spiritual traditions. This true \\"I\\" ‚Äî the consciousness that looks out at the world through each of us as through so many windows ‚Äî has many names. Esoteric Christianity calls it the Son; the Logos; Sophia, or \\"wisdom\\"; or the kingdom of heaven. For the Hindus it is atman; the Dzogchen tradition of Tibetan Buddhism speaks of it as rigpa, \\"pure consciousness\\"; other Buddhists call it \\"Buddha nature or simply \\"mind.\\" You can never see it, because it is that which sees. Francis of Assisi alluded to this when he said, \\"What we are looking for is what is looking.\\" Over and against this \\"I,\\" which is \\"that which experiences,\\" Smoley posits that which \\"is experienced ‚Äî whether inside ourselves or outside.\\" This statement highlights one unusual aspect of Smoley's views. He claims that it is possible to step back and look at the contents of one's own psyche as if it belonged to a third party. In one meditative exercise that he gives, he says, \\"even your most intimate feelings and desires will pass before you like images on a screen.\\" Thus for Smoley, even what is usually seen as the internal realm of the psyche is part of the \\"world\\" that is experienced. Smoley relates these observations to the ancient Christian division of the body, soul, and spirit, which, he claims, has become obscured over the centuries. The body, that is, the physical body, constitutes one level. The psyche (which he explicitly equates with the soul, on the grounds that in most versions of the New Testament the Greek word translated as \\"soul\\" is psyche) is the total constellation of an individual's thoughts, images, and feelings, conscious and unconscious. The third element, the spirit, the \\"I\\" or \\"true I,\\" as he puts it, \\"seems to have no power, no volition of its own, yet it is that in you which is constantly awake and experiences all that passes for your life.\\" Smoley claims that the sum total of experiences, physical and psychological, are what esoteric Christianity calls \\"the world.\\" Thus he uses this term in a more specific sense than has generally been done. For Smoley, the Gospel of John in particular, with its frequent and emphatic contrast of \\"I\\" with \\"the world\\" (e.g., \\"Be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world\\"; John 16:33), is an exposition of this fundamental duality. This isolated \\"I\\" that does nothing other than cognize would seem to lead to a type of solipsism. Smoley counters this by another assertion: that this \\"I\\" is part of a larger, collective \\"I\\" that encompasses the whole human race. He connects this idea with the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, the primordial man, as well as with the maximus homo or \\"universal human\\" of the 18t-century Swedish visionary Emanuel Swedenborg. He quotes the French esotericist Papus (G√©rard Encausse) to this effect: \\"Adam does not represent an individual man, but rather the sum total of all men and women in their ulterior differentiation.\\"Papus, \\"Fall and Rise,\\" Martinist Digest 3 (n.d.), 24-25; cf. Smoley, Inner Christianity, 58. In Smoley's \\"inner Christianity,\\" \\"Adam\\" symbolizes the human entity in its fragmented, isolated state. As in many instances, Smoley discounts the literal meaning of the Bible in favor of an esoteric sense. The fall of Adam and Eve, he contends, was caused by the desire of this cosmic Adam to know good and evil (symbolized by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil: Genesis 2:17). Smoley quotes Papus again to the effect that after the fall, \\"each cell of Adam became an individual human being.\\" But Smoley also emphasizes that this fall cannot be placed on a historical timeline, but was a cosmic event that preceded (and may have given rise to) the existence of the universe as we now know it. Because this fall would be an event that takes place outside the dimensions of space and time, Smoley's view neither conflicts nor concurs with contemporary scientific cosmologies. According to Smoley, esoteric Christianity symbolizes humanity in its fallen state of individuality by Adam. The restored human unity, the reintegrated maximus homo, is symbolized by Christ: \\"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive\\" (1 Corinthians 15:22). He explicitly relates his views to conceptions of the cosmic Christ and the Catholic doctrine of the mystical body of Christ. =Theology= Smoley's theology parallels his dichotomy of \\"I\\" and \\"the world.\\" Although he does not posit this dichotomy as absolute, contending that it arises out of a groundless being (or nonbeing) in which self and other are not distinguished, he insists that it is fundamental to the way we experience the world. While one may be able to transcend this duality through, say, mystical experience, it is very difficult to speak about, or conceptualize, this transcendence. He contends that this fact helps explain many of the apparently paradoxical or incomprehensible utterances of many mystics. Smoley's view of God recapitulates this position.See Michael Toms, \\"A Brief History of God with Richard Smoley\\"; New Dimensions radio interview conducted June 15, 2006; accessed May 26, 2014. \\"God is both wholly Self and wholly other. To put it more comprehensively still, God is the ultimate source out of which this duality of self and other arises.\\" He adds, \\"God is purusha, Self, that which sees; it is that which is most profoundly and intimately 'I.' God is also other, prakriti, the 'world,' that which is seen. How the divine is revealed is a matter, almost, of the stance from which we see it.\\" Because this \\"ultimate source\\" is infinite, it is unlikely to be personal in the sense that orthodox Christianity maintains. \\"If God is the ultimate ground of being out of which all arises, it must necessarily follow that God is not a person or persons as we customarily understand them.\\" At the same time, Smoley contends, its very infinitude also includes the capacity to manifest in a personal form. \\"Whether or not God is ultimately personal in the sense that we humans understand it, the tradition suggests that we are persons, and God can address us in ways we can understand ‚Äî that is, personally.\\" Smoley's view of the Christian Father and Son resembles the \\"subordinationist\\" view found in such figures as Philo of Alexandria and Origen. The Father is the transcendent aspect of God; the Son is the imminent aspect, which he equates with the Logos and Sophia, or the \\"primal level of consciousness,\\" or the \\"true I.\\" Smoley does not identify this principle with the historical Jesus in any kind of exclusive or privileged way: \\"This primal level of consciousness ... is the deepest part of us, as it is of everything that exists.\\" =Christology= Smoley's Christology must be understood in the light of these ideas. He appears to accept most current scholarship about the historical Jesus, which, beginning with David Friedrich Strauss in the 19th century, posits that much of what appears in the Gospels is mythical or legendary. Smoley's Christology thus departs radically from those of most Christian denominations, but he insists that this has always been known within the esoteric Christian tradition. He concurs with Origen, who says, \\"In the gospels ... events which did not take place at all are woven into the records of what literally did happen.\\"Origen, On First Principles, trans. G.W. Butterworth. New York: Harper & Row, 1966, 4.3.1, 289-90. Cf. Smoley, Inner Christianity, 4. Unlike Origen, however, and most other Christian sources, Smoley regards Jesus as no more divine than anyone else. He quotes A Course in Miracles (a text he cites frequently), which, speaking about Jesus, says, \\"Is he the Christ? O yes, along with you.\\"A Course in Miracles. Tiburon, CA: Foundation for Inner Peace, 1975, 3:83; cf. Smoley, Inner Christianity, 135. In fact Smoley appears to accept the Christology of A Course in Miracles, which portrays Jesus as the figure who, through his crucifixion and particularly his resurrection, crucially reversed the fall of the cosmic \\"Adam,\\" but only as a kind of first among equals in the human race. =Love= Smoley's views on love can be found in their most comprehensive form in his 2008 book Conscious Love. If consciousness is \\"that which relates self and other,\\" then \\"love is what unites self and other.\\"Smoley, Richard. Conscious Love: Insights from Mystical Christianity. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2008, 3. Broadly speaking, Smoley defines two types of love. The first is \\"transactional love or worldly love,\\" which is \\"calculated, calculating, and exact.\\" Most forms of love in ordinary life, he contends, are transactional in this sense, even those we do not customarily regard as such. For example, \\"it seems unlikely that transactionality ever totally vanishes from romantic love, even at its most exalted.\\" In regard to sexual love, Smoley's views are comparatively open- minded and accepting. \\"Love is sometimes expressed in a bonding for life, sometimes in a brief affair, or occasionally even in a thing as transient as a one-night stand. Sometimes it is virginal, sometimes whorish. ... [H]uman love takes as many forms as imagination and feasibility will permit, and if it seems to break the rules on countless occasions, this only serves to remind us that rules are not gods.\\" The same is the case with his views on homosexuality. He writes: \\"On the one hand, if homosexuality is unnatural, why has it persisted for so long in the face of so much opposition? On the other hand, if homosexuality is natural, what purpose does it serve?. ... The most obvious conclusion is that homosexuality seems to fulfill some role in nature that is not well understood. For the time being, we would probably be best served neither by condemning it nor by cooking up factitious reasons for its existence.\\" He then goes on to say, \\"From an ultimate perspective, there's probably nothing uniquely privileged about the union between man and woman.\\" While Smoley does not completely reject the popular idea of \\"soul mates\\" (which can be traced back to Plato's Symposium), he does display considerable skepticism about it. \\"What of the enormous numbers of people‚Äîsingle, divorced, or unhappily married‚Äîwho have never found their soul mates? What of those of us who lead lives of serial monogamy? Or polyamory and polyfidelity? Or prostitution? (The ancients in Babylonia knew that there is a sacred element even to this most despised and downtrodden of all professions.) All these types of relationships exist, have always existed, and to all appearances will continue to exist.\\" In Conscious Love, Smoley goes on to characterize the transactional elements present in marriage, family love, and friendship.See also Richard Smoley, \\"Love and Money.\\" Parabola 35:1 (spring 2010), 40-45. To all these he contrasts the Christian agape, unconditional or \\"conscious love,\\" a phrase he has taken from the teachings of Gurdjieff.Gurdjieff, G.I. All and Everything: Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1950, 361. Agape, in Smoley's view, comes from a recognition of \\"the I that is we\\"‚Äîa realization that the true \\"I\\" of the individual is at core identical to the \\"I\\" of all other humans and indeed all other beings: > The \\"love of the world,\\" with its accounts, transactions, and agendas, is > the love of Adam in his fallen state, in which each cell of his body > imagines that it is ... isolated and supreme and so finds itself fighting > for position with so many other beings who deludedly believe the same thing. > It is as if the cosmic Adam had been infected with an autoimmune disease. > Agape is the love of the cosmic Christ, in which each cell of Adam > recognizes that it is joined to the larger whole, that what in it says \\"I\\" > at the deepest level is identical to that which says \\"I\\" in everything else, > human and nonhuman. Because this is the truth, to realize it is to achieve > gnosis, to become conscious in the fullest sense. Hence \\"conscious love.\\" Smoley's contrast of \\"conscious love\\" with \\"transactional love\\" resembles the contrast between the \\"holy relationship\\" and the \\"special relationship\\" in A Course in Miracles.For a brief summary, see Kenneth A. Wapnick, \\"Special Relationships: The Home of Guilt,\\" Foundation for A Course in Miracles website; accessed May 25, 2014. Given Smoley's evident interest in this text, it is curious that he does not make any explicit reference to these ideas in Conscious Love. =Prophecy= Unlike many writers on esoteric subjects, Smoley shows considerable skepticism toward prophecy, writing that \\"prophecies of an imminent end have all failed over and over again for the last two millennia, so the soundest conclusion is that there is nothing in them.\\"Smoley, Richard. The Essential Nostradamus, 2d ed. New York: Tarcher/Penguin, 2010, 271. In his book The Essential Nostradamus, Smoley attempts to root Nostradamus in his own context in 16th-century France. He contends, for example, that the mysterious figure Hister mentioned in Nostradamus's prophecies was not, as is often claimed, a prophecy of Adolf Hitler but a metonymy for the Austrian Empire of the time, on the grounds that Ister (modified by Nostradamus to \\"Hister\\") is an ancient name for the Danube, the principal river of Austria. Smoley's general attitude toward his subject can be summed up thusly: \\"I would not base any of my future plans of expectations on anything Nostradamus predicted or is imagined to have predicted.\\" Elsewhere in the book Smoley discusses the larger dilemma faced by those who try to predict the future: > The scientific or quasi-scientific futurologist can base his forecasts only > on the continuation of current trends. And yet if we know nothing else about > the future, it is that current trends do not continue. There are > disruptions, dislocations, surprises. The futurologist cannot foresee these. > The apocalyptic prophet faces no such restrictions. He has no incentive to > predict more of the same; who would read him then? Consequently, he is > entirely happy to foretell all kinds of upheavals, natural and > supernatural‚Äîthe submerging of continents, the manifestation of > extraterrestrials, the shifting of the earth's pole, the return of Jesus > Christ. In one sense, he too is right. Cataclysms do occur. But somehow they > never occur in the way they were predicted. In an afterword prepared for the second edition of The Essential Nostradamus, Smoley is also skeptical about the then-current prophecies regarding 2012: \\"It seems ridiculous to me to single out specific dates.\\" He does, however, add that expectations focused on individual years highlight a belief in, and need for, a collective awakening of the human race.

The original name is \\"Elephant Rock\\" as the huge sandstone outcropping looks like an Elephant head when viewed from the north side. When the Park was created the people who assign names took the name of the spring just to the east, Eagle Springs, and mistakenly repeated it for the outcropping. Gary Cheney, grandson of the original owner of the adjacent Cheney Ranch always called it Elephant Rock and the name should be restored to not only be correct, but to avoid confusion with the original Eagle Rock in Los Angeles.

Bred in Kentucky, he was trained in France as two-year-old and established himself as a top-class racehorse by winning the Prix des Ch√™nes and finishing a close fourth in the Grand Crit√©rium. He was based in Ireland in 1978, when he proved himself one of the best milers in Europe, winning the Irish 2000 Guineas, St James's Palace Stakes and Sussex Stakes. He was retired to stud after a defeat in the Waterford Crystal Mile but had little success as a breeding stallion. He died in Spain in 1986 at the age of eleven. Background Jaazeiro was a bay horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by Carelaine Stable. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Sham, an American stallion best known for finishing second to Secretariat in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. Jaazeiro was the first foal of Rule Formi, an unraced daughter of the Argentinian champion Forli. At the Saratoga Yearling Sales, Jaazeiro was sold for $24,000, well below the sale average, and was sent to Europe to be trained in France by Fran√ßois Boutin. Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= Jaazeiro began his racing career with an impressive win in a maiden race over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse in August. In the following month he was moved up in class and distance and started favourite for the Group Three Prix La Rochette over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse but finished fourth, a length behind the winner River Knight. Two weeks later, over the same course and distance, Jaazeiro started 3.4/1 second favourite for the Group Three Prix des Ch√™nes. He was restrained at the back of the field by Philippe Paquet before accelerating in the straight, taking the lead inside the last 200 metres and winning by one and a half lengths from Pyjama Hunt, who was carrying five pounds more. The British jockey Lester Piggott took the ride when Jaazeiro contested France's most prestigious two-year-old race, the Grand Crit√©rium at Longchamp in October. He raced in second place before taking over from the pacemaker early in the straight. He was overtaken by his stable companion Super Concorde 400 metres from the finish and weakened slightly in the closing stages to finish fourth behind Super Concorde, Pyjama Hunt and Acamas, beaten less than two lengths by the winner. In late 1977 a half share in Jaazeiro was bought by Robert Sangster for a \\"six figure sum\\" and the colt was transferred to Ireland where he was trained by Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. =1978: three-year-old season= On his debut for his new trainer, Jaazeiro ran very disappointingly, finishing sixth behind Exdirectory when odds on favourite for the Ballymoss Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse in April. On 13 May, Jaazeiro, ridden by Piggott, started the 11/4 favourite for the Irish 2000 Guineas over one mile at the Curragh. He produced a sustained run on the outside of the twelve runner field to win by half a length from Strong Gale. After the race Vincent O'Brien was called to appear before the racecourse stewards to explain the colt's improved performance. The trainer's explanation, that the horse had been unsuited by the distance and ground conditions in his previous race, was accepted. In June, Jaazeiro was sent to England to contest the St James's Palace Stakes (then a Group Two race) over one mile at Royal Ascot in which he was matched against the leading British- trained colts Persian Bold and Formidable. Starting at odds of 5/2, he was restrained by Piggott in the early stages before making his challenge in the straight. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and held off the renewed challenge of Persian Bold to win by a head. In his next race Jaazeiro faced older horses, including Radetzky (Queen Anne Stakes), Ovac (Premio Parioli) and Gwent (Jersey Stakes) in the Group One Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Starting the 8/13 favourite, Jaazeiro was ridden with exaggerated confidence by Piggott, held up at the back of the field before switching to the outside to make his challenge in the straight. He quickly went to the front and won easily by two lengths from Radetzky, with Formidable and Ovac in third and fourth. A month later, over the same course and distance, Jaazeiro started 4/11 favourite for the Waterford Crystal Mile despite carrying an eight-pound penalty for his previous Group One wins. Piggott attempted to repeat the tactics employed in the Sussex Stakes, but was unable to reach the leaders and finished third behind Captain James and Formidable. Assessment As a two-year-old, Jaazeiro was rated the fourth-best juvenile in the French Free Handicap, behind Super Concorde, Pyjama Hunt and Acamas. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 124, six pounds behind their top- rated two-year-old Try My Best. In 1978 he was rated 127 by Timeform, three pound below the top-rated miler Homing. In the official International Classification he was rated the ninth best three-year-old in Europe, seven pounds behind the top-rated Ile de Bourbon. Stud record Jaazeiro was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Ballylinch Stud at Thomastown, County Kilkenny at an initial fee of ¬£4,000. He was not a success at stud, and was exported to Spain in 1985, dying a year later. He sired one top-class performer in Then Again, who won the Lockinge Stakes and the Queen Anne Stakes in 1987.

Originally recorded and storyboarded for the movie, it was removed from the final version. Media outlets believed the decision to exclude the song was based on its explicit references to sexuality. \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" had been added to the musical along with two other songs. It is one of two tracks that more prominently features vocals from the character Nala. The title is a reference to the 1994 film The Madness of King George. Opening the musical's second act, \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" primarily consists of dialogue between Scar, Nala, Zazu, and the hyenas Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed following Scar's rise to power due to his brother Mufasa's death. The lyrics revolve around Scar's paranoia, specifically his anxiety on the comparisons between himself and Mufasa, and his plan to produce an heir for his kingdom with Nala. Scholars had various interpretations of the song's lyrics and composition, who felt it used stream-of-consciousness to portray Scar as a Shakespearean character or interpreted the instrumental as a tango underscoring Scar's behavior towards Nala. For later productions of the musical, \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" was made shorter in length, before it was removed completely. Despite this, the song was included on the cast album for the original production, with John Vickery portraying Scar. It was also put on the records for the Mexican and Madrid productions. \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" primarily earned positive reviews from music critics, who believed it added more depth to the character of Scar. However, some commentators had more mixed to negative responses; some felt uncertain about the decision to add new material not found in the film to the musical, while others disagreed with the song's explicit content. In 2014, animator Eduardo Quintana created an animated sequence for the song for the 20th anniversary of the animated film. The video received positive reviews from media outlets, who found the animation quality to be on a professional level.  Background  \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" is one of three original songs that Elton John and Tim Rice had added for the musical adaptation of Disney's 1994 animated film The Lion King. John had composed the music while Rice wrote the lyrics; the title is a reference to the 1994 film The Madness of King George.Hischak & Robinson (2009): p. 126 Created to further elaborate the storyline, it is one of two new tracks that feature the character Nala, along with \\"Shadowland\\". In the original film, she had only performed in a supporting role in the song \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\". For the film, a version of the song had been recorded and storyboarded, but it was ultimately cut from the final version. Smosh's Mikey McCollor wrote that it was removed from the film for being \\"so creepy\\", primarily due to Scar's sexual comments toward Nala. Echoing McCollor's comments, io9's Lauren Davis described Scar's interactions with Nala as creepy, and MoviePilot's Olivia van der Will attributed the exclusion of the song to its lyrics' reference to sexuality. Matthew Roulette of TheFW believes that the scene was abandoned because of the characters' significant age difference. In later productions of the musical, \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" was cut down to a shorter length, before it was fully removed altogether. However it was included on the cast album for the musical, which was released on January 1, 1997. The song included the show's original members Heather Headley, Geoff Hoyle, Tracy Nicole Chapman, Stanley Wayne Mathis, Kevin Cahoon, and John Vickery; Vickery had played the role of Scar for the official recording. The song was also featured on albums for the musical's Mexican and Madrid productions.  Context and composition  Part of the opening to the show's second act, \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" takes place entirely in Scar's cave, and involves Scar, Zazu, Nala, and the hyenas Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed.Viagas & Asch (2006): p. 225 The lead vocal for \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" spans between Eb4 to G5, with the instrumental including a piano and chords. An \\"extended character song for the dissatisfied lion monarch\\", the lyrics revolve around Scar's \\"paranoid pursuit of the lion throne\\". The song is primarily composed of dialogue rather than singing, with Rice describing it, along with \\"Chow Down\\", as \\"just potboilers\\". The Buffalo News' Heather Violanti summarized the performance as \\"five minutes of painful rumination by the evil Scar and his hyena henchmen after Scar's usurpation of the throne\\". During the song, the hyenas express their discontent with Scar for his inability to deal with a drought affecting the Pride Lands, begging for him to give them a \\"fix of flesh\\" to satisfy their \\"needs\\". Through the course of the lyrics, Scar becomes increasingly paranoid about comparisons to his deceased brother Mufasa. After fixating on a plan to produce an heir for his kingdom, Scar makes sexual advances to Nala, who explicitly refuses him. Some of Scar's comments to Nala include: \\"She's got those assets feminine, I have to make her mine!\\" and \\"Nala, my, my, how you have grown.\\" Scholars had various interpretations of the song's lyrics and composition. In their book The Disney Song Encyclopedia, Thomas S. Hischak and Mark A. Robinson described the composition as a \\"stream-of-consciousness number alternat[ing] between buffoonish comedy and cold-blooded evil\\". Alfredo Michel Modenessi wrote, in his article \\"Disney's 'War Efforts': The Lion King and Education for Death; or Shakespeare Made Easy for Your Apocalyptic Convenience\\" that the song drew close parallels between Scar and a Shakespearean character, and further develops his relationship with the hyenas following his assumption of power.Modenessi (2009): p. 193 Modenessi identified \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" as taking on qualities of a tango. Connecting Scar's behavior with the Argentine tango, Modenessi described his attempts to approach Nala as occurring to \\"the beat of that stereotyped 'music of seduction'\\".Modenessi (2009): p. 195  Reception and impact  \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" received primarily positive reviews from music critics. Ben Hewis of WhatsOnStage.com included the song in his list of his top five favorite show tunes, writing that it \\"shin[ed] a humanising light on the thought process of Scar is brilliantly effective storytelling\\". Hewis found the track to be an interesting exploration of Scar, and felt its removal from current productions of the musical was disappointing. Featuring it as an example of why Scar was one of the \\"15 most terrifying musical theater villains\\", Backstage's KC Wright described it as a \\"snarling signature song\\". Megan Green of Australian Stage wrote that \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" was an example of one of the \\"new, and equally memorable, songs\\" created for the musicals. James MacKillop of The Syracuse New Times described \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" and \\"Be Prepared\\" as the show's standouts. Some commentators had more mixed to negative responses to the song. Brandon Jones of The Global Dispatch criticized \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" and \\"Chow Down\\" as \\"a bit too tedious\\", and felt that the beginning of the second act was too long. Heather Violanti was critical of the song's content, writing that its \\"disgusting jokes about intestinal worms may drive you mad yourself\\", and negatively compared it to the Lebo M.-written \\"One by One\\". = Fan-made animation = In 2014, animator Eduardo Quintana released an original sequence using a portion of Vickery's version of \\"The Madness of King Scar\\". Created as a \\"tribute\\" to the musical and the 20th anniversary of the animated film, Quintana had spent roughly two years completing the animation for the video. Focused on the dialogue between Scar and Nala, the scene begins with Scar chewing on a bone before progressing to his sexual propositions to Nala. Released on Quintana's official YouTube account, the video reached over two and a half million views as of November 23, 2016. Critical response to the video has been positive. Mikey McCollor praised the animation, writing that he had initially believed it was done by Walt Disney Animation Studios animators. Van der Will wrote that Quintana's animation was \\"seriously out of this world!\\" Christophe Foltzer of the website Ecranlarge.com also praised Quintana, emphasizing the amount of animation that he did as the video's sole animator. Foltzer wrote that he wanted to see further work from Quintana.

It premiered in 1997 as part of the musical The Lion King, a stage adaptation of Disney's 1994 animated film of the same name. Mark Mancina produced the song and arranged by Mark A. Brymer. Taymor wrote the lyrics based on the melody from \\"Lala\\", a song from the 1995 soundtrack album Rhythm of the Pride Lands. Jason Raize, who first performed the role of Simba for the Broadway production, first performed and recorded \\"Endless Night\\"; his version is included on the original cast recording. \\"Endless Night\\" is a ballad that lyrically deals with Simba grieving the death of his father Mufasa. The song includes vocals by a choir that encourages Simba to move forward. Reception to the song was mainly positive. Some commentators praised how it helped to develop Simba's character. \\"Endless Night\\" has been performed in different instances outside the show; Nick Afoa released a version in support of the United Kingdom charity Centrepoint, and Adam Jacobs sang it as part of a mashup with \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" at a Theatre Development Fund event. Recording and release \\"Endless Night\\" was composed by South African composer Lebo M., German composer Hans Zimmer, and American musician Jay Rifkin, and arranged by Mark A. Brymer. American theatre director Julie Taymor composed the lyrics, and had developed \\"Endless Night\\" as Simba's signature song for the musical.Taymor & Greene (1998) It was one of ten new songs composed for the musical production of the 1994 Disney animated film The Lion King. The melody was based on \\"Lala\\" from the 1995 soundtrack album Rhythm of the Pride Lands. Written in Zulu, \\"Lala\\" deals with the loss of a family member. Reflecting on the writing process, Taymor said compositions were selected from Rhythm of the Pride Lands for their mood not their lyrics. \\"Endless Night\\" was first performed and recorded by American actor and singer Jason Raize, who first played the role of Simba for the Broadway show. The original cast recording includes Raize's version of the song, and the accompanying vocalists are called \\"The Lion King Ensemble\\". \\"Endless Night\\", and the rest of the soundtrack, were recorded at Sony Music Studios in New York City; the music was mixed at The Village in Los Angeles and mastered at Oceanview Digital Mastering in Manhattan Beach, California. American composer Mark Mancina produced the song. The Walt Disney Company released the soundtrack on November 14, 1997, in both cassette and CD formats. It was made available as a digital download in 2006. The Hal Leonard Corporation published and distributed the track. Context and composition \\"Endless Night\\" is a ballad composed in D major; its instrumentation is provided by piano, synthesizer, guitar, and drums. With a vocal range spanning from the low note of D4 to the high note of A5, the song is performed either by a tenor or a baritone, with a choir prominently featured. Tom Millward of the New York Theatre Guide associated the song with folk music. As part of The Lion Kings second act, \\"Endless Night\\" is performed in a setting the playbill describes as \\"Under the Sun\\".Viagas & Asch (2006): p. 225 To add to the power of the performance, the actor portraying Simba appears alone in front of a cyclorama emphasized by a \\"bold lighting change\\". The song's opening lines are sung from a crouched position. Constructed as a lament and a monologue, the song shows Simba grieving the death of his father Mufasa. Simba sings the song directly to his father; the opening lines are \\"Hem hem hem. Hem hem. Where has the starlight gone?\\". The chorus is: \\"I know that the night must end, and that the sun will rise. I know that the clouds must clear and that the sun will shine.\\" The song focuses on Simba's growth into new responsibilities and his memories of his father's promise to remain with him. He questions whether he should help to reclaim the Pride Lands, and sings to his father: \\"Whenever I call your name / You're not anywhere.\\" Symbolizing \\"voices of hope in the night\\",Wolf (2017): p. 123 the choir reminds Simba \\"even the longest night is followed by sunrise\\".Hischak & Robinson (2009): p. 49 At the song's conclusion, Simba realizes his father will always guide him. Wei-Huan Chen of the Houston Chronicle said the song contains the core message of The Lion King, \\"a story about a father and a son, where the son loses the father and must then find his purpose in life\\". Some commentators found \\"Endless Night\\" to be disconnected from the musical's overall structure. The Houston Chronicles Everett Evans felt the parts written by Lebo M. were at odds with the more pop-oriented songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, saying \\"the disparity between the two halves leaves some seams showing in the overall score.\\" While discussing a split in the musical's sound and style, Michael Billington wrote: \\"What is curious about the show is that it borrows from so many different traditions.\\" Critical reception Critic response of the song was primarily positive. Praising its placement in the show, The Denver Posts John Moore said \\"Endless Night\\" was part of \\"a wildebeest stampede of ongoing powerful moments\\". Juliet Pennington of The Sun Chronicle wrote that the song was \\"emotionally charged and powerful\\" due to Simba's grief over his father. Identifying \\"Endless Night\\" as one of the show's strongest moments, the Toronto Stars Richard Ouzounia praised the choice to only feature the actor on the stage. WLOS' Justin Hinton wrote that \\"Endless Night\\" and \\"He Lives in You (Reprise)\\" proved that the adult version of Simba had the best musical numbers. Wei-Huan Chen described the track as having \\"standalone power\\"; she explained it was an example of how a musical is successful \\"not through a scene that must be viewed through a narrative context, but rather a creation whose achievement is self-contained\\". When discussing the songs Mancina, Lebo M., and Zimmer added to the show, the Los Angeles Daily News Evan Henerson described them as adding a greater \\"musical excitement\\". \\"Endless Night\\" did receive some criticism. Pam Kragen of The San Diego Union-Tribune dismissed it as boring, and The Herald's Alan Morrison wrote that \\"Endless Night\\" and \\"Shadowland\\", both written for the theatre, were \\"more synth-string dated than the others written earlier.\\" Live performances and other versions \\"Endless Night\\" was included on cast recordings in other languages, including Japanese, Dutch, and German. In 1998, an instrumental version was made available on the jazzy-contemporary album Disney's Instrumental Impressions - 14 Classic Disney Love Songs, and Stage Stars Records released a karaoke version of the song in 2011. Nick Afoa performed \\"Endless Night\\" in 2013 during a successful audition for Simba for an Australian production of The Lion King. While singing it, he thought about his son \\"who lives across the other side of the world\\" and \\"broke down and couldn't carry on\\". He released his version of the song in 2018 through Disney on Broadway's YouTube page to support the United Kingdom charity Centrepoint. The same year, Afoa sang \\"Endless Night\\" at the Lyceum Theatre as part of a Facebook Live event; the performance was uploaded to Disney on Broadway's account. Adam Jacobs cited \\"Endless Night\\" as the most enjoyable aspect of playing Simba in a North American tour version of the show. In 2016, he performed a mashup of \\"Endless Night\\" and \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" for a Theatre Development Fund event. Josh Tower, who portrayed Simba the longest in the Broadway production, sang \\"Endless Night\\" for a 2014 event celebrating African-American history at Upper Dublin High School to a positive audience response. Tower's performance of the song as part of the stage show received positive reviews from critics.

Hargrove appeared in the 2013 documentary Blackfish, wrote a book about his experiences in Beneath the Surface, and has campaigned in support of legislation in California and New York to end the practice of keeping killer whales in captivity.  Career  John Hargrove grew up in Orange, Texas. At a young age, he saw his first Shamu killer whale show at SeaWorld Orlando, and envisioned a career as a killer whale trainer. In 1993 when Hargrove was age 20 and attending the University of Houston, Hargrove was hired as an apprentice trainer at SeaWorld San Antonio. In 1995 Hargrove was transferred to SeaWorld San Diego in California where he worked until 2001. He was ultimately promoted to a Senior Trainer at Shamu Stadium. Immediately after resigning from SeaWorld California, Hargrove was hired by Marineland of Antibes in France until 2003. In France Hargrove conditioned and performed in- water interactions with orcas that had never been in the water with trainers before. He then left the industry until March 2008, when he returned to SeaWorld in San Antonio where he was promoted to a Senior 1 trainer at Shamu Stadium. He worked there until resigning in August 2012. As of 2015, Hargrove resides in New York City.  Advocacy and Blackfish Seven days after resigning from SeaWorld, Hargrove was interviewed for the documentary Blackfish. In the film, he speaks about his career training killer whales and his belief that these whales are not suitable for captivity. After promoting Blackfish, Hargrove was asked to co-sponsor the Orca Welfare and Safety Act proposed by Democrat Assemblymen Richard Bloom. Hargrove testified on April 8, 2014 before the California State Assembly. in May 2014, Hargrove was invited by New York State Senator Greg Ball and Assemblyman James Tedisco to Albany to speak at the fourth annual New York State Animal Advocacy Day. Beneath the Surface Hargrove is the author of a memoir, Beneath the Surface, published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2015. Howard G. Chua-Eoan co-authored the book, which covers Hargrove's experiences with orca at SeaWorld and in nature. It reached #18 on The New York Times nonfiction hardcover best-seller list. SeaWorld increased its criticism of Hargrove after the book was published, saying Hargrove quit after being disciplined for a severe safety violation while at SeaWorld. SeaWorld also forwarded to reporters a five-year-old cell phone video of an intoxicated Hargrove using the racist slur \\"nigger\\". Hargrove accused SeaWorld of conducting a \\"smear campaign\\" against him to distract from the issue of killer whales in captivity. He later apologized for the language in the video.Nguyen, Tim. Seaworld Critic Apologizes for Video of Him Using the N-Word: ‚ÄòIt Is Indefensible‚Äô. April 16, 2015. Hargrove said the \\"severe safety violation\\" was only a delay in notifying supervisors after he corrected another employee's error, and that his leaving SeaWorld was unrelated to it. On November 9, 2015 PETA presented Hargrove its Courage of Conviction Award for revealing SeaWorld's treatment of captive orcas. Days later, Hargrove's memoir was optioned for film by producers Michael K. Snyder and Rachel K. Stotts through Crash Films.

She investigates video compression, feedback, and glitches, using her exploration to generate art works. Menkman's The Collapse of PAL (2011), in which she acknowledges the end of PAL (Phase Alternating Line)‚Äîan analogue video programming structure‚Äîis the digital version of a live audio visual performance first performed on national Danish television and afterward realized at oa.

In 2019 Menkman won the Collide International Barcelona Award from CERN.  Glitch art  In 2011, Menkman published Network Notebook #04: The Glitch Moment(um). This book uses information theory to propose an understanding of \\"glitch art\\" as a particular genre of contemporary art. She argues that the glitch shifts between being an artifact and a process. http://networkcultures.org/_uploads/NN%234_RosaMenkman.pdf She also wrote A Vernacular of File Formats and the Glitch Studies Manifesto in the same year. The manifesto was awarded 'best practice' by Virtueel Platform, then sector institute for e-culture in the Netherlands. The publication of Network Notebook #04: The Glitch Moment(um) coincided with the GLI.TC/H festival, organized by Menkman in collaboration with American artists Nick Briz and Jon Satrom. The first GLI.TC/H festival in 2010 (Chicago) was followed by a second and third edition in 2011 (Chicago, Amsterdam, Birmingham) and 2012 (Chicago). Her work makes use of compression artifacts, resulting from discrete cosine transform blocks (DCT blocks), which are used in most digital media data compression formats, such as JPEG digital images and MP3 digital audio. In 2015, Menkman opened the institutions of Resolution Disputes at Transfer Gallery in New York City (in reference to dispute resolution and display resolution). In October 2015, one of the works in the show, called DCT (referencing discrete cosine transform), was awarded first prize at the Crypto Design Challenge hosted by Museum Of The Image (MOTI) in Breda, the Netherlands. Her Vernacular of File Formats piece has attained \\"cult status\\". It was translated to Polish (together with Glitch Studies Manifesto), commented and republished in Glitch Art is Dead in 2016.

Hawwara are amongst the most prominent tribes in Upper Egypt, with branches found mainly in Sohag, Qena, and Asyut. They are considered to be the aristocracy of Sohag to this day.  Branches  The Hawwara were composed of numerous tribes and clans. Some of them are: the Addasa, the Andara, the Awtita, the Baswa, the Gharyan, the Haragha, the Banu Irmazyan, the Kaldin, the Kamlan, the Karkuda, the Lahan or Lahana, the Maghar, the Malila, the Maslata, the Mindasa or Mindas (Mandasa, Mandas), the Misrata, the Razin, the Satat, the Tarhuna, the Wannifan, the Warfalla, the Wargha, the Warsatifa, the Washtata, the Yaghmorasen, the Zakkawa and the Zanzafa. History The Hawwara's original homeland was in Tripolitania, 8th century accounts mention an ard Hawwara (country of the Hawwara). From the 8th century to 12th century, the eastern boundaries of their land ran through Tawergha, Waddan, and Zella. Hawwara's territory was bordered to the east by the Mazata tribe. A fraction of the Hawwara were part the Fatimid army that conquered Egypt in 969. After the conquest, they were given land grants by the Fatimid caliphs. The Hawwara tribe became dominant in al-Buhayra in Egypt. In 1380/1381, Barquq, Sultan of the Mamluks, established some Hawwara groups in Upper Egypt and granted the Iqta' of Girga to the Hawwari chief, Isma'il ibn Mazin. Isma'il was succeeded by Umar, the eponymous of the Banu Umar clan. After sacking al-Fayyum in 1485, the Hawwara tribes became the true rulers of Upper Egypt. In Egypt's history, the whole southern region is the cradle of tribal settlements. By the 19th century, Upper Egypt was completely ruled by the Hawwara tribe. Governance had become decentralized as the Hawwara spread their sovereignty over ten provinces and parts of the other remaining twenty- one provinces in Upper Egypt. The Hawwara tribe were deemed to be the de facto rulers of Upper Egypt and their authority spanned across North Africa, up until the campaigns of Ibrahim Pasha in 1813, which finally crushed their dominant influence.Baer, Gabriel. \\"Studies in the Social History of Modern Egypt.\\" (1969). During the Mamluk rule in Egypt, the Hawwara were the most dominant tribe in Upper Egypt under the leadership of Sheikh Hammam.Petry, Carl F., ed. The Cambridge History of Egypt. Vol. 1. Cambridge University Press, 2008. Sultan Barquq made relationships with the Hawwara in order to keep the Arab tribes from becoming powerful.Petry, Carl F. \\"A Geniza for Mamluk Studies? Charitable Trust (Waqf) Documents as a Source for Economic and Social History.\\" Mamluk Studies Review 2 (1998): 51-60. Towards the end of the Mamluk dynasty, the Hawwara and Arabs began cooperating to kill Mamluks. Due to their cooperation, the Mamluks labelled the Hawwara as being Arab.

Most of the students reside in St Louis County, Minnesota in particular the communities of Tower, Soudan, Embarrass, Ely, Aurora, and Virginia. VCS is a hybrid project based learning school where students complete projects based on Minnesota curriculum requirements in addition to attending individual classes for each subject. Education plans are individualized to each student and is overseen by a teacher/advisor. Each teacher/advisor is responsible for approximately 15 students in a class called an advisory. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays are the standard days, while Wednesdays have a different structure to accommodate environmental education, associated projects, and the school's Big Circle school wide meeting. Wednesdays are also early release days to accommodate staff meetings/trainings during the year. History of VCS As far back as 2007, local citizens in Tower began thinking about better ways for children to be educated. When the public district tore down the high school in 2010 and the displaced students were bused to distant schools, plans for a grades 7-12 charter school began in earnest. The process was slow, with funding and facility challenges along the way. However, in December of 2012, VCCS was awarded a $125,000 federal school start-up grant. Meanwhile area residents donated generously, and the City of Tower underwrote the remodeling of an unused manufacturing building\\". The school has recently completed its fifth school year and has been renewed by their sponsor, Audubon Center of the North Woods, for another 5 year charter contract. Academics VCS uses JMC/Google Docs as its learning management and grading system. Students complete projects by working with advisors to first outline their projects beforehand, log the time during, and then assessing the project for completeness in order to record earned credit for graduation. This allows all students to individualize their learning toward topics they have a personal interest in while still meeting MN educational standards. New for the 2015-16 school year, the schedule was varied for students depending on how much structured time that particular student needed from almost all project time to almost all seminar/elective based. Expo Day occurs near the end of the year to showcase projects that students have completed for their graduation requirements. This is also an opportunity for students to develop public speaking skills and polish their presentation skills for later in life. The public is invited to the presentation to see what student's have been working on. Culture & Discipline VCS is a student centered and team collaborative school model that attempts to address many of the difficulties that students who haven't been successful in a traditional school have faced. To that end, VCS uses a restorative justice model when it comes to their discipline plan. The goal is not to be punitive, but to repair the damage done by those who choose to act in such a manner that is disruptive to the community.

It depicts the largely forgotten world of Chinese American nightclubs and performers of the '30s and '40s. The book opens with a quotation attributed to Buddha: ‚ÄúOnly three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth.‚Äù See organizes her narrative around these three elements ‚Äì The Sun (October 1938 ‚Äì August 1940; The Moon (August 1940 ‚Äì September 1945); and The Truth (December 1945-June 1948). The novel briefly concludes with a reunion of many of the main characters in 1988. The novel debuted at #10 on the New York Times best seller list of hardcover fiction. It led the San Francisco Chronicle's list of recommended new books June 15, 2014.  Background  See did extensive research in writing China Dolls. Part of it involved interviews with performers from the world she writes about in the novel. This process was very important in developing her story. \\"I have incorporated many anecdotes from people who lived through the Chinese-American nightclub era to create my fictional characters.\\" She has posted an online collection of materials related to the people, places, music, and events that provide historical background to the novel. See originally wrote the novel with Grace as narrator but later revised it so that Grace, Ruby, and Helen alternate the narration.Denise Davidson, \\"Characters in Lee's China Dolls Not Fragile Women\\", U-T San Diego, 06/08/2014. See's name is misspelled in the title. China Dolls was partly inspired by the real life of Midi Takaoka of the vaudeville act Taka Sisters. Midi was tragically murdered in a love triangle in 1936 at the age of 22. The murderer of Midi Takaoka, one of her former lovers, confessed to the crime after turning himself in to the police and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after five years. An additional five years mandatory sentence was added for his assault of Takaoka's current lover during her murder. Recently See has remarked: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been very lucky in the sense that I don‚Äôt write what I think people might like. I really write about the things that I‚Äôm most passionate about, I‚Äôm most interested in, or obsessed with. I‚Äôm lucky that readers have gone along with my obsessions.\\" Her continued search for stories that have been largely forgotten or hidden ‚Äì the lives of Chinese American nightclub performers and the injustice of the American treatment of Japanese American citizens during the war, for example ‚Äì remains central to her work as a writer.  Plot  Chinese Telephone Exchange on Washington in Chinatown, San Francisco, where Helen is working when she meets grace China Dolls centers on three young women who are attracted to the San Francisco nightclub scene right before American involvement in World War II. At first Grace Lee, Helen Fong, and Ruby Tom seem the unlikeliest of friends. Grace is a seventeen-year-old Chinese American from Plain City, Ohio. She escapes to San Francisco to get away from an abusive father but is also driven by dreams of stardom based on her dancing skills. Where Grace has been completely cut off by her family from her Chinese heritage, Helen is a virtual prisoner in the wealthy family compound of her father, forced to play a subservient role in a Chinese world that denies her freedom. Ruby Tom brings a completely different background to the mix. Coming from a Japanese family with strong roots in Japanese history and culture, Ruby is totally committed to becoming famous in America, leaving her parents in Hawaii to do so. By chance Helen runs into Grace when she is seeking help in finding a Chinese nightclub that might hire her as a dancer. In helping Grace find Charlie Low‚Äôs new Forbidden City (nightclub), See wrote the preface to this book Helen is tempted to try out as well since no previous experience is needed. At the dance tryouts, Helen and Grace meet Ruby Tom (Kimiko Fukutomi) ‚Äì a very attractive dancer who was born in Los Angeles but then moved to Hawaii with her Japanese family. When Grace affirms that she wants to be a star, Ruby confesses that she loves glitter and wants to be famous. This is based on the life of legendary dancer Jadin Wong. Although the three young women are immediately drawn to each other, the reader soon senses that their deepening friendship will be threatened by conflicts over careers, love, and hidden secrets. Ruby is aware of some of this from the very beginning: ‚ÄúThe three of us were as different as could be, and . . . I had a hunch that the two of them were harboring deeper truths, just as I was . . . Friendship was uncharted territory for me, maybe for all of us. Would the three of us end up as good companions or as vicious enemies?‚Äù Topaz War Relocation Center (1943) Although each woman struggles with the difficult challenge of becoming successful as an Asian American performer in an Occidental world as well as with the trauma associated with World War II, their individual paths are different. Grace must learn how to become tougher as she deals with first love, betrayal, repeated career rejection, and good breaks that often lead to bad consequences. Ruby‚Äôs determination to become famous at any cost leads her to parlay work as an exotic performer into a starring role at The Forbidden City. Although her family suffers immediately from the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and from the anti-Japanese reaction that follows, Ruby insists that she is an American and tries to pass herself off as a Chinese performer ‚Äì until her true identity is betrayed to the FBI and she is sent to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah. The importance of Helen‚Äôs role in the novel is only fully revealed at the end. In a complex relationship with her two friends, it turns out that Helen‚Äôs secrets are the most important of all and the key to understanding the dynamics of how the three women relate to each other. Quite appropriately Ruby‚Äôs depiction of the final confrontation of the three is in a chapter called ‚ÄúThe Dark Shadow Side‚Äù.  Reviews  Michael Magras discussed China Dolls in the context of See's writing as a whole, particularly from Snow Flower and the Secret Fan to the present. He suggested that the main themes of Snow Flower and the Secret Fan‚Äîfemale friendship, the ties that bind women together as women, and how women stand by each other‚Äîapply to all her recent fiction, including China Dolls. The latter is \\"a compelling story\\" containing \\"powerful passages.\\" He concluded that See's work transcends the category of women's fiction, warranting \\"wider respect for the distinctive worlds she recreates and the care she takes in depicting the relationships within them\\", thus appealing to both male and female readers. Jennifer Keishin Armstrong wrote that the best part of China Dolls is its treatment of Chinese American women during the 1930s and '40s. For example, \\"the way the girls simply accept being exoticized sex objects as the price of being an 'Oriental' dancer  and often play to stereotypes in their desperation to be noticed.\\" Valerie Minor emphasized the novel's treatment of the suffering of Japanese Americans during World War II, focusing especially on the impact of the war on Ruby and her family. Eugenia Zukerman terms China Dolls a \\"superb new historical novel\\", adding that \\"the conclusion of this emotional, informative and brilliant page-turner resonates with resilience and humanity.\\" Publishers Weekly noted the alternation of points of view among the three main characters, \\"with each woman‚Äôs voice strong and dynamic, developing a multilayered richness as it progresses. The depth of See‚Äôs characters and her winning prose makes this book a wonderful journey through love and loss.\\" Kirkus Reviews faults the novel's \\"episodic and creaky plot\\" yet concludes by praising See for shedding light on a part of show business history that has been largely overlooked.

It was established in 1994 by American entrepreneur Scott C. Davis. Cune features a variety of Middle East- related books, with a focus on Syria and the Levant. Cune also publishes literary nonfiction with an interest in women of courage and West coast authors. To support its literary publishing efforts, Cune also publishes books on education and is developing how-to titles on various subjects.http://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/cunepressbooks History Davis established Cune Press in May 1994 in his native Seattle. Reportedly, Davis took his cue from Andre Schiffrin, the legendary New York editor and intellectual who ultimately left Pantheon to establish the New Press. Davis financed Cune Press from the income of his private construction company. He was soon joined by founding \\"partners\\" Mamoun Sakkal (who was born in Aleppo) and Steven Schlesser as well as dozens of other volunteers. Sakkal was a well- known Arabic calligrapher in the Kufic style, and Schlesser was an independent historian. The name Cune was derived from \\"cuneiform\\" a term that in Latin, means \\"wedge\\" (the shape of a stylus point in soft clay tablets). Cuneiform script was used by early Syrians‚ÄîPhoenicians on the coast who developed the phonetic alphabet in their settlements near the current day city of Latakia. Editorial Focus Cune's website says that the publishing house is interested in Syria-related material and \\"thoughtful\\" non-fiction books including titles demonstrating political and cultural courage among women. Cune authors include Ali Farzat, a prominent political cartoonist; Ramzy Baroud, a Palestinian-American scholar who writes on the Arab-Israeli conflict and runs PalestineChronicle.com; and Sami Moubayed, a Syrian historian and author of \\"Steel & Silk: Men and Women Who Shaped Syria.\\" In 2003, Davis himself published an account of what he had seen in 1987 in Syria: \\"The Road From Damascus\\" which was based on 400 pages of hand-written notes jotted down during his journey.

During the 1990s, they were the largest and most prominent gang in the SW9 postcode. Members were known to be involved in the drugs trade, robberies, shootings, stabbings, and general violence. The gang associated with the colours red and purple. The group reformed as a music collective and label called PDC Rap Group.  History  The prominent gang in the area during the 1980s was called the 28s. Inspired by the 28s, local youths Elijah Kerr, now known as Jaja Soze, Nathan Cross (Inch), Michael Deans (Birdie), and Simon Maitland (Phat Si) all grew up around Angell Town Estate in Brixton, South London. Together they formed their own gang as a successor to the 28s called the Young 28s, although they had no actual affiliation with the 28s gang. The gang originally focused primarily on business robberies and drug dealing. In 1995, another local youth known as Tanna came up with the name \\"PDC\\", meaning \\"Peel Dem Crew\\" or \\"Pil Dem Crew\\". \\"Peel Dem\\" was Jamaican street slang for robbing or ripping people off. The PDC continued Brixtons longtime rivalry with neighbouring Peckham by committing robberies in the area, causing conflict with local gang Peckham Boys. The gang became known for \\"steaming\\", the act of rushing into banks, stores, or trains and taking money from the till, passengers, or anything they could grab. The gang grew through the 1990s and began to control much of crack cocaine dealing in South London. The gang grew to cover not only Brixton, but Kennington and parts of Stockwell. The gang generated conflicts with local Jamaican-led gangs in the areas. Jaja Soze, the boss of PDC, ironically referred to himself as the 'boss of bosses' as a nod to the mafia title. In 2002, the police began an undercover surveillance operation that would lead to the imprisonment of various PDC leaders and gang members, including Kojo Cole (caught buying drugs) and his younger brothers Byron (also known as Ribz), who was sentenced to 21 months detention in YOI, and Errol (also known as Skippy), who was sentenced to custody. Three of the original founders of the gang, Nathan Cross, Simon Maitland, and Jaja Soze, were also arrested for supply related offences and all were sentenced to over three years in jail. = Splintering of the gang = By the early 2000s, imprisonment of many PDC leaders led to the gang splintering. Various independent gangs emerged from this splintering, such as the Muslim Boys (as nicknamed by the police and press) and Y28s (not to be confused with Y28s that preceded PDC, which was a different group), the latter of which was formed by former members of the PDC Brats, a subset for younger members. The Y28s would later join up with Tiny OC to form GAS Gang. The Muslim Boys were named as such not by the gang members, but the police and press alike. Police would encounter youth who would claim to be muslim in order to gain preferential treatment (although some members had indeed converted to Islam). The gang themselves later adopted the name. Some members of the Muslim Boys began to present themselves as Islamists and claim links to Al Qaeda in order to gain street cred. This group caused a stir in the media for their mix of gangsterism and religion and were said to engage in forced conversions at gunpoint,Heale, John; One Blood: Inside Britain's Gang Culture; Simon & Schuster, 2011 although the substance to these claims of forced conversions and of their threat level has been called into question. Nonetheless, following the claims, the Mayor of London's senior advisor on policing, Lee Jaspar, described the Muslim Boys as a terrorist front \\"as tough to crack as the IRA\\". On New Years Eve in December 2004, PDC affiliate Solomon Martin (also known as Blacker) was shot dead in Thornton Heath. Members of PDC that were affiliated with Blacker would dissociate from PDC and form their own gang known as CFR (Certified Riderz or Corelone Family Riderz). Other former members of PDC would form PIF (Paid In Full), and Tanna, who came up with the name \\"PDC\\", went and formed the 031 Bloods. = Rebranding as legitimate business = During his imprisonment, Jaja Soze renounced gang life and, around 2005, rebranded the gang into a group called \\"Poverty Driven Children\\". In prison, he qualified in business studies. Following Jaja's release from prison, he encouraged members of the gang to do more positive things with their lives and started up a music label instead, called \\"PDC (Public Demand Cartel) Entertainments\\", led by Jaja and former gang members Najar Kerr (also known as Naja Soze), Byron Cole, Nathan Cross (Inch), Sykes, Errol Cole, Michael Deans (Birdie), and Simon Maitland (Phat Si). They released an album, Pray Days Change, and several music videos. PDC also formed a clothing line called \\"Public Demand Cartel\\", a barbershop called \\"Pristine Designer Cuts\\", and a youth engagement project called \\"Code 7\\".Kemp, Ross; Gangs; Penguin UK, 2008 In 2007, the Lambeth Council falsely claimed that PDC was the boroughs largest gang with 2,500 members. PDC Entertainment at the time had 2,500 fans on one of its MySpace pages. Jaja Soze repeatedly stated in interviews that the gang no longer existed. In 2009, Danny Dyer covered the PDC in his documentary series Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men.  Music (PDC rap group)  PDC started making music in the mid-1990s, releasing popular mixtapes and music videos, and winning a Mixtape Award in 2011 for outstanding contribution to the mixtape culture.

Early life He is the son of Sean Rainey and Joyce Marion Wallace (1923‚Äì2006), better known as Marion Wrottesley, after her later marriage to Lord Wrottesley. Career Hung On You jacket tailored for John Lennon and worn by him during the Beatles 1966 German tour in Hamburg. In December 1965, Rainey together with his then wife Jane Ormsby Gore opened the fashion boutique Hung On You, at 22 Cale Street, London, with a mural by Michael English. Rainey had no previous experience in the fashion business or in retailing, and instead was inspired by his well-dressed friends including his wife's brother Julian Ormsby Gore, and the antique dealer Christopher Gibbs. The decor and tailoring were somewhat similar to Nigel Waymouth and Sheila Cohen's Granny Takes a Trip, which opened three months later in February 1966. His wife Jane Ormsby Gore had been making regular visits to India, looking for fabrics, so there was also an oriental accent to the clothes, as well as a repurposing and reuse of vintage garments and designs. Rainey later relocated Hung On You to 430 King's Road, Chelsea. His then wife, Jane Ormsby Gore, in a 2006 interview with the V&A; Museum said, > Michael made the most gigantic mistake of leaving Cale Street and going onto > the King's Road. He felt that it was happening on the King's Road, but it > cost a lot of money to move, and people didn't know where we were. It became > less successful then. Before it was slightly more slick, with a big > jardini√®re mirrored thing in the middle of the shop. We had got two children > by then, and we were seriously into soul seeking and going on fasts and > meditating... We left London, sold everything, gave away everything, and > went to live in Gozo. London times and everything were over. He sold the lease to the boutique in 1969 to Tommy Roberts and it became Mr Freedom. Rainey was particularly known for flowery shirts and kipper ties in bold colours. Rainey's customers included musicians Mick Jagger and The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Kinks and the actor Terence Stamp. According to Nik Cohn in his book \\"Today there are no gentlemen\\", Hung On You \\"was simultaneously the last fling of dandyism and the first intimation of Hippie, of strangenesses to come\\". Personal life Rainey married Jane Ormsby Gore, the eldest daughter of Lord Harlech, about whom the V&A; notes \\"widely perceived as a style leader of her generation, Jane Ormsby Gore worked for Vogue in the early 1960s\\". She also worked with the antique dealer Christopher Gibbs. Rainey latterly lived in Granada, and had been based in Spain for many years. He died in January 2017 at the age of 76.

The movement began in 1960 and was most active in the '60s and '70s. At its peak, the Society numbered half of the population of Buka Island as members. The Society is best known for refusing to pay the Head Tax to the colonial government of the time, the Port Moresby Administration, and its subsequent clash with police in 1962. While the Society was mainly focused on anti-tax activism, the Port Moresby Administration classified it as a cargo cult. Former Police Inspector John Hihina described the Society this way: \\"In 1962 we had trouble at Hahalis on Buka Island, where John Teosin, Francis Bagai[sic], and the old Sawa started a cargo cult. About 2,000 members joined in and the situation was rather awkward\\". History The Hahalis Welfare Society was formed in 1960 by Catholics John Teosin and Francis Hagai. Initially, the movement was a breakaway from the East Coast Buka Society, which had been established for several years. Teosin and Hagai founded the Society on the principles of communal farming and self-help. They started the Society as a means to get the government to aid the Halia people, by building a school on the island. When this did not happen, the Halia people became unhappy, and became convinced that they no longer owed the government anything, if the government was not going to help them. Heavy taxes imposed on the Halia people by the colonial government caused tension on Buka Island. These tensions came to a head in 1962, culminating in the Hahalis Welfare Society Rebellion. =Hahalis Welfare Society Rebellion= The Society was upset at the Head Tax imposed on them by the Port Moresby Administration, believing they weren't getting their fair share of the benefits from the tax. As a group, the Society vowed to pay the tax to their own organisation, rather than the Port Moresby Administration. The Port Moresby Administration responded in February 1962. They recruited 500 police officers from throughout Papua New Guinea. When the police officers were flown to Buka, they faced off against a crowd of 1,000 Society members, including men, women, and children. The ensuing confrontation ended with the injury of 40 Society followers and 25 police officers, as well as the arrests of Teosin, Hagai, and nearly 600 Society members. Following the mass arrest, many supporters were released on appeal, after which the Society agreed to begin paying the tax again. Tensions eased at that point, and the government left the Society alone afterward. In 1975 Society membership numbered half the population of Buka Island, which was 25,000 at the time. That same year, the Society supported Bougainville separatism. After secession, the Society supported the provincial government into the 1980s.

Area The area called Hembrug was formerly a hem, that is, a headland later diked in to become part of a polder. Originally called De Hem, it later became named after the bridge across the North Sea Canal; see below. Bridge The Hembrug is the name given to a swing bridge built in 1878 to carry the railroad between Amsterdam and Zaandam in the Netherlands across the North Sea Canal, and to its replacement, a longer and higher bridge built between 1903 and 1907, after the canal had been widened to cater for an increase in ship traffic. The newer bridge was approached by a long embankment, to enable the railroad to reach deck level on a moderate grade or slope. During World War II, the bridge, which provided railroad access to the northern part of Holland, was rigged with demolition charges by the Germans, who loaded the central pier with 400 boxes, each containing 3 kilograms of explosives. Twice those explosives were removed by Dutch resistance operatives: on the night of 26 September 1944, two members of the local swimming team, Jaap Boll and Remmert Aten, dived down and got into the central pier by way of an underwater opening, and removed the explosives. The Germans discovered that the explosives had been removed when they saw packaging material floating around, so Remmert Aten swam down a second time, after the explosives had been replaced. The operation of the bridge was twice disrupted by ships colliding with it. On 20 October 1974 Santa Fe Construction's semi-submersible derrick lay barge Choctaw II caused damage which was not completely repaired. The bridge was made obsolete by the construction of the Hemtunnel, which became operational in 1983. On 27 May 1983 the last train passed over the bridge. Denied the status of Rijksmonument, the spans were removed later that year, and the bridge piers felled by explosives in the spring of 1985. The ship in the center of the image is almost exactly where the Hembrug used to be. Train station From 1907 until 1982, Hembrug was the name of a halt on the railroad line north of the bridge, built for the employees of three factories: the Artillerie- Inrichtingen (a State-owned munitions factory, in operation under various names since the 17th century), the Norit factory (which made activated carbon), and (doors and kitchens). Busy in the early morning and the evening with workers, the station was almost deserted during the day. It was opened on 1 January 1907 and originally had a station master. Latterly Hembrug became an unmanned halt, with wooden shelters on each of the two platforms. Services to the halt ceased on 23 May 1982. In 1983 part of the station was moved to Krommenie and converted to a garage.

Biography  Bahram was the son of a certain Ardashir, and belonged to a Zoroastrian family. He is first mentioned as one of the secretaries of the Buyid king Adud al-Dawla, and in 976/7 acted as a negotiator for the latter; after Adud al-Dawla had defeated his cousin Izz al-Dawla at Ahvaz, Bahram was sent to negotiate with Izz al- Dawla and gave the latter permission to retire and settle in Syria, then under Hamdanid control. However, on his way to Syria, Izz al-Dawla became convinced by Abu Taghlib, the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul, to go fight again against his cousin. On May 29, 978, Izz al-Dawla along with Abu Taghlib invaded the domains of his Adud al-Dawla and fought against him near Samarra. Bahram also participated in this war; Izz al-Dawla was once again defeated, and was captured and executed at the orders of Adud al-Dawla. Bahram along with the rest of the Buyid army then marched to Mosul and captured the city, which forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Byzantine territory in Anzitene where he asked for aid. Meanwhile, the Buyid army was completing the conquest of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar; The important Hamdanid city of Mayyafariqin was shortly captured by them, which forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Rahba from where he tried to negotiate peace with Adud al-Dawla. During the same period, Bahram along with other Buyid officers, were sent to arrest Izz al-Dawla's former vizier Ibn Baqiyya. In 983, Bahram was sent under an army to fight the Kurdish Marwanid ruler Abu Shuja Badh, but was defeated. During the reign of Adud al- Dawla's son Samsam al-Dawla, Bahram served as his deputy, but was executed in 986.

VCC is now defined as an internal knowledge catalyzed by social media platforms and shared by a plurality of individuals driven by the spontaneity, the homogeneity, and the synchronicity of their online actions. VCC occurs when a large group of persons, brought together by a social media platform think and act with one mind and share collective emotions. Thus, they are able to coordinate their efforts efficiently, and could rapidly spread their word to a worldwide audience. When interviewed about the concept of VCC that appeared in the book - Hyperconnectivity and the Future of Internet Communication - he edited, Professor of Pervasive Computing, Adrian David Cheok mentioned the following: \\"The idea of a global (collective) virtual consciousness is a bottom-up process and a rather emergent property resulting from a momentum of complex interactions taking place in social networks. This kind of collective behaviour (or intelligence) results from a collision between a physical world and a virtual world and can have a real impact in our life by driving collective action.\\"  Origin of the term  In 1999-2000, Richard Glen Boire provided a cursory mention and the only occurrence of the term \\"Virtual collective consciousness\\" in his text as follows: The recent definition of VCC evolved from the first empirical study that provided a cyberpsychological insight into the contribution of Facebook to the 2011 Tunisian revolution. In this study, the concept was originally called ‚Äò‚Äòcollective cyberconsciousness‚Äù. The latter is an extension of the idea of ‚Äò‚Äòcollective consciousness‚Äô‚Äô coupled with ‚Äò‚Äòcitizen media‚Äô‚Äô usage. The authors of this study made also a parallel between this original definition of VCC and other comparable concepts such as Durkheim's collective representation, ≈Ωi≈æek‚Äôs ‚Äò‚Äòcollective mind‚Äô‚Äô or Boguta‚Äôs ‚Äò‚Äònew collective consciousness‚Äô‚Äô that he used to describe the computational history of the Internet shut down during the Egyptian revolution. Since VCC is the byproduct of the network‚Äôs successful actions then these actions must be timely, acute, rapid, domain- specific, and purpose-oriented to successfully achieve their goal. Before reaching a momentum of complexity, each collective behavior starts by a spark that triggers a chain of events leading to a crystallized stance of a tremendous amount of interactions. Thus, VCC is an emergent global pattern from these individual actions. In 2012, the term Virtual Collective Consciousness has resurfaced and was brought to light after extending its applications to the Egyptian case and the whole social networking major impact on the success of the so-called Arab Spring. Moreover, the acronym VCC was suggested to identify the theoretical framework covering on-line behaviors leading to a virtual collective consciousness. Hence, on-line social networks have provided a new and faster way of establishing or modifying ‚Äúcollective consciousness‚Äù that was paramount to the 2011 uprisings in the Arab world.  Theoretical underpinnings of VCC  Various theoretical references ranging from sociology to computer science were mentioned in order to account for the key features that render the framework for a Virtual Collective Consciousness. The following list is not exhaustive but the references it contains are often highlighted: * Durkheim's collective representations are at the heart of VCC since collectivity taken decisions according to Durkheim's assumptions will approve or disapprove individuals‚Äô actions and help them eventually reach their final goal. * McLuhan's global village: The shrinking of our big world to a small place called cyberspace is made possible by technological extensions of human consciousness. * Jung‚Äôs collective unconscious: When a society is witnessing significant changes, the anchoring of archetypal images (e.g., political leaders) seems to be deeply rooted in individuals' collective unconscious that is likely to bias their political choices. Individual memories of public events were also supposed to convey a \\"collective awareness\\" that can be subconsciously altered by the instantaneous spread of information through social networking around the world. * Wegner‚Äôs Transactive Memory (TM): social networking platforms such as Facebook during the Tunisian revolution or Twitter during the Egyptian revolution served as placeholders of a VCC where information can be harnessed and steered to the highly specific revolutionary purpose. Although research on TM have been originally limited to couples, small groups, and organizations, recent studies strongly suggest that an effective TM can operate on a very large scale too. * James Surowiecki's wisdom of crowds  Some illustrations of VCC  Besides the studied effect of social networking on the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, the former via Facebook and the latter via Twitter other applications were studied under the prism of VCC framework: # The Whitacre's virtual choir: A compelling example of the degree of autonomy and self identity members of a spontaneously created network through a VCC is Eric Whitacre's unique musical project that involved a collection of singers performing remotely to create a virtual Choir. The resulting effect of all the voices illustrated a genuine virtual collective empathy merging the artist mind with all the singers through his silent conducting gestures. # The Harlem Shake dance: # The Bitcoin protocol: It was questioned whether or not the Bitcoin protocol can morph into Virtual Collective Consciousness. The Byzantine generals problem was used as an analogy to understand the behavioral complexity of the community of Bitcoin's users.

Burdett entered the Irish House of Commons in 1704, sitting for Carlow County to 1713. Subsequently he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Carlow Borough until 1715 and then again for Carlow County until his death in 1727. On 11 July 1723, Burdett was created a baronet, of Dunmore, in the County of Carlow, with a special remainder to the heirs of his sister Anne, wife of Walter Weldon, who sat also in the Parliament of Ireland. In 1725, he was appointed Governor of County Carlow, a post he held for the next two years. He married firstly the twice-widowed Honora Boyle, daughter of Michael Boyle, Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Archbishop of Armagh and his second wife Mary O'Brien, in 1700. She died ten years later and Burdett remarried Martha Vigors, daughter of Bartholomew Vigors, Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin and Martha Neale, in 1715. He died, aged 58 and was succeeded by his only son, William, by his second wife.

History Brothers John and Charles Ruggles thought that they could make some easy money by robbing a stagecoach. John, a sex addict and ex- convict, had lost his wife to illness and had left his young daughter to live with relatives while he went to live off the land in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Concerned about his brother's well-being, Charles sought him out in the mountains. Charles had been robbing stagecoaches throughout California and Nevada with a man called Arizona Pete, and talked John into joining him on the outlaw trail. On May 10, 1892, the brothers robbed the Weaverville stage, but the take was small. The men settled on a location on top of a hill five miles north of Redding to pull off their next robbery. The stage would be moving slowly, and the horses would be tired from the uphill journey. The brothers stopped the stage on May 12, 1892, and everything went according to plan, until Charles was hit with buckshot fired by a guard riding inside the coach. More shots rang out, and soon passenger George Suhr, driver Johnny Boyce and guard Amos \\"Buck\\" Montgomery were all wounded. John Ruggles ran up to Montgomery and shot the seriously wounded man in the back, killing him. Boyce regained control of his team and drove off as fast as the horses could run. John, thinking that Charles was mortally wounded, said goodbye to his brother, grabbed the money and fled the scene. A posse found Charles where he was shot and took him into custody. His wounds looked worse than they were, and he was soon recovering in the Redding jail. Under questioning by Wells Fargo detective John Thacker, Charles admitted that the other robber was his brother John. A reward of eleven hundred dollars was placed on John's head. John Ruggles was arrested while eating a meal at a restaurant in his hometown of Woodland, California, by a Yolo County deputy sheriff. Taken by train to Redding, John was overcome with joy upon seeing that his brother was not dead.Kulczyk,David. (2008). California Justice: Shootouts, Lynching and Assassinations in the Golden State.

The phenomenon was first documented by Swedish perceptual psychologist, Gunnar Johansson, in 1973. There are many brain areas involved in this process, some similar to those used to perceive faces. While humans complete this process with ease, from a computational neuroscience perspective there is still much to be learned as to how this complex perceptual problem is solved. One tool which many research studies in this area use is a display stimuli called a point light walker. Point light walkers are coordinated moving dots that simulate biological motion in which each dot represents specific joints of a human performing an action. Currently a large topic of research, many different models of biological motion/perception have been proposed. The following models have shown that both form and motion are important components of biological motion perception. However, to what extent each of the components play is contrasted upon the models. Neuroanatomy Research in this area seeks to identify the specific brain regions or circuits responsible for processing the information which the visual system perceives in the world. And in this case, specifically recognizing motion created by biological agents. =Single Cell Recording= The most precise research is done using single-cell recordings in the primate brain. This research has yielded areas important to motion perception in primates such as area MT (middle temporal visual area), also referred to as V5, and area MST (medial superior temporal area). These areas contain cells characterized as direction cells, expansion/contraction cells, and rotation cells, which react to certain classes of movement. =Neuroimaging= Additionally, research on human participants is being conducted as well. While single-cell recording is not conducted on humans, this research uses neuroimaging methods such as fMRI, PET, EEG/ERP to collect information on what brain areas become active when executing biological motion perception tasks, such as viewing point light walker stimuli. Areas uncovered from this type of research are the dorsal visual pathway, extrastriate body area, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, and premotor cortex. The dorsal visual pathway (sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù pathway), as contrasted with the ventral visual pathway (‚Äúwhat‚Äù pathway), has been shown to play a significant role in the perception of motion cues. While the ventral pathway is more responsible for form cues. =Neuropsychological Damage= Valuable information can also be learned from cases where a patient has suffered from some sort of neurological damage and consequently loses certain functionalities of neural processing. One patient with bilateral lesions that included the human homologue of area MT, lost their ability to see biological motion when the stimulus was embedded in noise, a task which the average observer is able to complete. Another study on stroke patients sustaining lesions to their superior temporal and premotor frontal areas showed deficits in their processing of biological motion stimuli, thereby implicating these areas as important to that perception process. A case study conducted on a patient with bilateral lesions involving the posterior visual pathways and effecting the lateral parietal-temporal- occipital cortex struggled with early motion tasks, and yet was able to perceive the biological motion of a point light walker, a higher-order task. This may be due to the fact that area V3B and area KO were still intact, suggesting their possible roles in biological motion perception. Biological Motion Perception Models =Cognitive Model of Biological Motion Form (Lange & Lappe, 2006)= Background The relative roles of form cues compared to motion cues in the process of perceiving biological motion is unclear. Previous research has not untangled the circumstances under which local motion cues are needed or only additive. This model looks at how form-only cues can replicate psychophysical results of biological motion perception. Model Template Creation Same as below. See 2.2.2 Template Generation Stage 1 The first stage compares stimulus images to the assumed library of upright human walker templates in memory. Each dot in a given stimulus frame is compared to the nearest limb location on a template and these combined, weighted distances are outputted by the function: ::F_{tc}(t) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n e^ \\\\left (\\\\frac{(\\\\mu_{tc}-p_i(t))^2}{2X\\\\sigma}\\\\right) where p_i gives the position of a particular stimulus dot and \\\\mu_{tc} represents the nearest limb position in the template. \\\\sigma represents the size of the receptor field to adjust for the size of the stimulus figure. The best fitting template was then selected by a winner-takes-all mechanism and entered into a leaky integrator: ::\\\\tau \\\\frac{\\\\delta u_{1,2}(t)}{\\\\delta t} = -u_{1,2}+i_{1,2}+w_+f(u_{1,2}(t))- w_-f(u_{2,1}(t)) where w_+ and w_- are the weights for lateral excitation and inhibition, respectively, and the activities u_{1,2} provide the left/right decision for which direction the stimulus is facing. Stage 2 The second stage attempts to use the temporal order of the stimulus frames to change the expectations of what frame would be coming next. The equation ::\\\\tau \\\\frac{\\\\delta v_{1,2}(t)}{\\\\delta t} = -v_{1,2}(t) + w_{m,n}u(t) takes into account bottom-up input from stage 1 (u), the activities in decision stage 2 for the possible responses (v_{1,2}), and weights the difference between selected frame n and previous frame m. Implications This model highlights the abilities of form-related cues to detect biological motion and orientation in a neurologically feasible model. The results of the Stage 1 model showed that all behavioral data could be replicated by using form information alone - global motion information was not necessary to detect figures and their orientation. This model shows the possibility of the use of form cues, but can be criticized for a lack of ecological validity. Humans do not detect biological figures in static environments and motion is an inherent aspect in upright figure recognition. =Action Recognition by Motion Detection in Posture Space (Theusner, Lussanet, and Lappe, 2014)= Overview Old models of biological motion perception are concerned with tracking joint and limb motion relative to one another over time. However, recent experiments in biological motion perception have suggested that motion information is unimportant for action recognition. This model shows how biological motion may be perceived from sequences of posture recognition, rather than from the direct perception of motion information. An experiment was conducted to test the validity of this model, in which subjects are presented moving point-light and stick-figure walking stimuli. Each frame of the walking stimulus is matched to a posture template, the progression of which is recorded on a 2D posture‚Äìtime plot that implies motion recognition. Posture Model Template Generation Posture templates for stimulus matching were constructed with motion tracking data from nine people walking. 3D coordinates of the twelve major joints (feet, knees, hips, hands, elbows, and shoulders) were tracked and interpolated between to generate limb motion. Five sets of 2D projections were created: leftward, frontward, rightward, and the two 45¬∞ intermediate orientations. Finally, projections of the nine walkers were normalized for walking speed (1.39 seconds at 100 frames per cycle), height, and hip location in posture space. One of the nine walkers was chosen as the walking stimulus, and the remaining eight were kept as templates for matching. Template Matching Template matching is computed by simulating posture selective neurons as described by A neuron is excited by similarity to a static frame of the walker stimulus. For this experiment, 4,000 neurons were generated (8 walkers times 100 frames per cycle times 5 2D projections). A neuron's similarity to a frame of the stimulus is calculated as follows: ::R_\\\\psi(t) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^N \\\\exp \\\\left( - \\\\frac{\\\\left  (x_i(t), y_i(t)) - (\\\\Chi_i, _\\\\psi, \\\\Rho_i, _\\\\psi) \\\\right \\\\vert ^2}{2 \\\\sdot \\\\sigma} \\\\right) where (x_i, y_i) describe a stimulus point and (c_i, r_i) describe the limb location at time t; \\\\psi describes the preferred posture; R describes a neuron's response to a stimulus of N points; and \\\\sigma describes limb width. Response Simulation The neuron most closely resembling the posture of the walking stimulus changes over time. The neural activation pattern can be graphed in a 2D plot, called a posture-time plot. Along the x axis, templates are sorted chronologically according to a forward walking pattern. Time progresses along the y axis with the beginning corresponding to the origin. The perception of forward walking motion is represented as a line with a positive slope from the origin, while backward walking is conversely represented as a line with a negative slope. Motion Model Motion Detection in Posture Space The posture-time plots used in this model follow the established space-time plots used for describing object motion. Space-time plots with time at the y axis and the spatial dimension at the x axis, define velocity of an object by the slope of the line. Information about an object's motion can be detected by spatio-temporal filters. In this biological motion model, motion is detected similarly but replaces the spatial dimension for posture space along the x axis, and body motion is detected by using posturo-temporal filters rather than spatio-temporal filters. Posturo- Temporal Filters Neural responses are first normalized as described by :: u_\\\\psi(t) = \\\\frac{R_\\\\psi(t) - \\\\bar{R}}{\\\\bar{R}} where R_y(t) describes the neural response; _\\\\psi describes the preferred posture at time t; \\\\bar{R} describes the mean neural response over all neurons over t; and n_y(t) describes the normalized response. The filters are defined for forward and backward walking (g^f, g^b respectively). The response of the posturo-temporal filter is described ::r_\\\\psi(\\\\tau) = \\\\sum_{t=0ms}^\\\\tau \\\\sum_{p=1}^{100} g_{\\\\tau, \\\\psi} (t, p) \\\\sdot u_\\\\psi(t) where r is the response of the filter at time \\\\tau; and p describes the posture dimension. The response of the filter is normalized by ::N_\\\\psi(\\\\tau) = \\\\max \\\\left [ \\\\left ( \\\\frac{r_\\\\psi(\\\\tau)}{\\\\sum_t \\\\sum_p g_{\\\\tau, \\\\psi} (t, p)^2} \\\\right ), 0 \\\\right ] where N describes the response of the neuron selecting body motion. Finally, body motion is calculated by ::\\\\varepsilon_\\\\psi(\\\\tau) = N_\\\\psi^F(\\\\tau)^2 - N_\\\\psi^B(\\\\tau)^2 where \\\\varepsilon describes body motion energy. =Critical Features for the Recognition of Biological Motion (Casille and Giese, 2005)= Statistical Analysis and Psychophysical Experiments The following model suggests that biological motion recognition could be accomplished through the extraction of a single critical feature: dominant local optic flow motion. These following assumptions were brought about from results of both statistical analysis and psychophysical experiments. First, Principal component analysis was done on full body 2d walkers and point light walkers. The analysis found that dominant local optic flow features are very similar in both full body 2d stimuli and point light walkers (Figure 1). Since subjects can recognize biological motion upon viewing a point light walker, then the similarities between these two stimuli may highlight critical features needed for biological motion recognition. Through psychophysical experiments, it was found that subjects could recognize biological motion using a CFS stimulus which contained opponent motion in the horizontal direction but randomly moving dots in the horizontal direction (Figure 2). Because of the movement of the dots, this stimulus could not be fit to a human skeleton model suggesting that biological motion recognition may not heavily rely on form as a critical feature. Also, the psychophysical experiments showed that subjects similarly recognize biological motion for both the CFS stimulus and SPS, a stimulus in which dots of the point light walker were reassigned to different positions within the human body shape for every nth frame thereby highlights the importance of form vs the motion (Fig.1.). The results of the following psychophysical experiments show that motion is a critical feature that could be used to recognize biological motion. The following statistical analysis and psychophysical experiments highlight the importance of dominant local motion patterns in biological motion recognition. Furthermore, due to the ability of subjects to recognize biological motion given the CFS stimulus, it is postulated that horizontal opponent motion and coarse positional information is important for recognition of biological motion. Model The following model contains detectors modeled from existing neurons that extracts motion features with increasing complexity. (Figure 4). Detectors of Local Motion These detectors detect different motion directions and are modeled from neurons in monkey V1/2 and area MT The output of the local motion detectors are the following: ::G_p(x) = H(v(x),v_1,v_2) \\\\cdot b(\\\\theta,\\\\theta_p) where x is the position with preferred direction \\\\theta_p,, v is the velocity, \\\\theta is the direction, and H is the rectangular speed tuning function such that ::H(v,v_1,v_2) = 1 for v_1 < v < v_2 and H(v,v_1,v_2) = 0 otherwise. The direction-tuning of motion energy detectors are given by :: b(\\\\theta,\\\\theta_p)=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right ) \\\\left [\\\\ 1 + cos(\\\\theta,\\\\theta_p)\\\\right]\\\\ \\\\right\\\\\\\\}^q where q is a parameter that determines width of direction tuning function. (q=2 for simulation). Neural detectors for opponent motion selection The following neural detectors are used to detect horizontal and vertical opponent motion due by pooling together the output of previous local motion energy detectors into two adjacent subfields. Local motion detectors that have the same direction preference are combined into the same subfield. These detectors were modeled after neurons sensitive to opponent motion such as the ones in MT and medial superior temporal (MST). Also, KO/V3B has been associated with processing edges, moving objects, and opponent motion. Patients with damage to dorsal pathway areas but an intact KO/V3B, as seen in patient AF can still perceive biological motion. The output for these detectors are the following: ::o_l(x)=\\\\sqrt{max(g_p(x_i))max(g_r(x_j))} where x is the position the output is centered at, direction preferences p and r , and i,j signify spatial positions of two subfields. The final output of opponent motion detector is given as ::o_l(x)=max(o_l(x_k)) where output is the pooled responses of detectors of type l at x_k different spatial positions. Detectors of optic flow patterns Each detector looks at one frame of a training stimulus and compute an instantaneous optic flow field for that particular frame. These detectors model neurons in Superior temporal sulcus and Fusiform face area The input of these detectors is arranged from vector u and are comprised from the previous opponent motion detectors‚Äô responses. The output is the following: ::G(u) = e^{(u-u_0)^T C(u-u_0)} such that u_0 is the center of the radial basis function for each neuron and C is a diagonal matrix which contains elements that have been set during training and correspond to vector u. These elements equal zero if the variance over training doesn't exceed a certain threshold. Otherwise, these elements equal the inverse of variance. Since recognition of biological motion is dependent on the sequence of activity, the following model is sequence selective. The activity of the optic flow pattern neuron is modeled by the following equation of ::\\\\tau H_k^l(t) = -H_k^l(t) + \\\\sum_m w(k-m)f(H_k^l(t)+G_k^l(t)) in which k is a specific frame in the l-th training sequence, \\\\tau is the time constant.f(H) a threshold function, w(m) is an asymmetric interaction kernel, and G_k^l(t) is obtained from the previous section. Detectors of complete biological motion patterns The following detectors sum the output of the optic flow pattern detectors in order to selectively activate for whole movement patterns (e.g. walking right vs. walking left). These detectors model similar neurons that optic flow pattern detectors model: Superior temporal sulcus and Fusiform face area The input of these detectors are the activity of the optic flow motion detectors, H_l^l(t). The output of these detectors are the following: ::\\\\tau_s P^l (t) = -P^l(t) + \\\\sum_k H_l^l(t) such that P^l(t) is the activity of the complete biological motion pattern detector in response to pattern type l (e.g. walking to the left), \\\\tau_s equals the time constant (used 150 ms in simulation), and H_k^l(t) equals the activity of optic flow pattern detector at kth frame in sequence l. Testing the model Using correct determination of walking direction of both the CFS and SPS stimulus, the model was able to replicate similar results as the psychophysical experiments. (could determine walking direction of CFS and SPS stimuli and increasing correct with increasing number of dots). It is postulated that recognition of biological motion is made possible by the opponent horizontal motion information that is present in both the CFS and SPS stimuli.

In addition to his legislative career as a member of the House of Nobles, he also served as a judge and became an assistant judge of Hawaii's first Supreme Court. Early life Nothing is known of Kapena's early life except that he was born into a family from the lesser strata of Hawaiian nobility, subordinate to the high chiefs or ali ªi nui. In 1831, he became a member of the first class of the Lahainaluna Seminary under American missionary Lorrin Andrews, the school's first principal. His classmates included historian David Malo and Samuel Kamakau and politicians Boaz Mahune and Timothy Ha ªalilio. He graduated in 1835 after four years in the school. Political career Kapena became the secretary and advisor of Kƒ´na ªu, the Kuhina Nui, and represented her in the drafting of Hawaii's first constitution. Many graduates of Lahainaluna became politicians or advisors in the court of King Kamehameha III. Kapena became the secretary and advisor to Kƒ´na ªu, the Kuhina Nui (an office similar to that of a prime minister or co-regent), and represented her in the drafting of Hawaii's first constitution and declaration of rights. In an effort to establish a stable government against colonial ambitions, King Kamehameha III, the Kuhina Nui and the council of chiefs sought to make Hawaii a constitutional monarchy. Kapena and Boaz Mahune (representing the King) assisted American missionary William Richards in the endeavor of drafting this document. Mahune and the graduates at Lahainaluna were chiefly credited with drafting the Declaration of Rights of 1839 in the contemporary newspaper The Polynesian. However, research by Hawaiian historian Jon Kamakawiwo ªole Osorio credits Richards as the actual author of the Declaration and the majority of the later 1840 Constitution while Mahune and Kapena were only assistants.; ; The 1840 constitution codified the existing political structure of the kingdom and created the Hawaiian Supreme Court and the Legislature of Hawaii. Kapena worked as a governmental clerk during the 1841 session of the Legislature Assembly at Lahaina, the capital at the time. This session was the first time that the King and his nobles had met as a governing body since the ratification of the Constitution in 1840. He served as a clerk to the legislature again in 1843 with George Luther Kapeau, and then with William Richards during the 1845 session. In 1842, Kapena was elected by the legislature to serve as one of the four Assistant Judges of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. This court was the first formed in the Kingdom of Hawaii between 1842 and 1848, and was headed by King Kamehameha III and Kuhina Nui KekƒÅuluohi, and by Keoni Ana after KekƒÅuluohi's death. The four judges appointed in 1842 were not Associate Justices (like individuals appointed after 1848) but served the same capacity as assistant to the Chief Justice, i.e. the King. Kapena sat as a judge from 1842 to 1848, when the body was reformed under Chief Justice William Little Lee.; ; In 1845, Kapena was also appointed an official member of the House of Nobles. In order to replace the diminishing number of ali ªi nui, it was decided by the existing members of the House of Nobles on April 2, 1845 to vote into the council lower ranking chiefs who were \\"men of learning\\" and elevate their chiefly statuses. Kapena was among the first group of six lesser chiefs chosen.; ; As a member of the House of Nobles, Kapena would go on to serve in multiple legislative sessions between 1850 and 1866. Kapena was also later appointed Circuit Judge for Oahu. His obituary said that in this office he \\"gave satisfaction to all.\\" After the accession of King Kamehameha V in 1864, Kapena was also appointed as a member of the Privy Council of State, an advisory council for the monarch. Personal life In addition to his political positions, Kapena worked as a newspaper editor. He wrote in one of the kingdom's first Hawaiian language newspapers, the Ka Nonanona (which ran from 1841 to 1845), and later became the editor of the, Ke Au Okoa (which ran from 1865 to 1873). In 1870, his hƒÅnai son John MƒÅkini Kapena became its editor until it merged with Ka Nupepa Kuokoa, and became Ka Nupepa Kuokoa Me Ke Au Okoa I Huiia in 1873. Kapena married Kahilipulu on September 2, 1846, in Honolulu, O ªahu. Kapena was also married to a sister of Joshua Kekaulahao. She died before 1858. Kapena led the procession at the funeral of all six of her family members including her two brothers, nephew, cousin and father. It is not known if these two pieces of information refer to the same person. Nothing beyond that is known about Kapena's marital status. In the Hawaiian tradition of hƒÅnai (a form of informal adoption), he adopted his nephew John MƒÅkini Kapena (1843‚Äì1887), the only son of MƒÅkini and NƒÅ ªawa, a relative of King KalƒÅkaua. John Kapena went on to become an important government minister under the reign of KalƒÅkaua in the 1870s. The younger Kapena also married Emma A ªalailoa Malo (1846‚Äì1886), the only daughter of David Malo, the elder Kapena's Lahainaluna classmate. Death and burial Grave marker for Kapena in the Kawaiaha ªo Cemetery The Kapena family plot in the Kawaiaha ªo Cemetery On March 12, 1868, Kapena died in Honolulu at his residence in the Nuuanu Valley. Kapena had become an invalid in the last years of his life which prevented him from performing any governmental duties. In 1868, the Hawaiian Gazette wrote of Kapena's legacy; > Judge Kapena, the last rites to whose memory, have just been performed, was > a man whose character stood unblemished in this nation, and whose abilities, > in the various positions of life, by him occupied, were conspicuous. In his > official and social relation he was admired and beloved by the Hawaiian > people. and his good name will be cherished not only by his family, but by a > large circle of friends. His funeral at Kawaiaha ªo Church was attended by friends, family, members of the Legislature, and the Chamberlain, who represented the King. The church was packed with mourners. The funeral service was conducted by Henry H. Parker, a reverend of Kawaiaha ªo Church, with assistance from George Washington Pilip≈ç of Kaumakapili Church. Parker's discourse, which was in Hawaiian, gave a brief sketch of Kapena's life, and held him up as an example for his countrymen to follow. After the service, Kapena's coffin was placed in a newly constructed tomb or vault in the churchyard. His grave marker reads \\"Kupuna Kapena 1868.\\" John MƒÅkini Kapena and his wife Emma A ªalailoa Malo Kapena were also buried in the Kapena family plot. Other relatives interred there include Umiuimi, David Kalu and Kahoihoi Pahu.

He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a ten-year man on 20 April 1790 and later received a Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of Glasgow in 1799.The Clergy Database, Person: Peat, Robert (1793 - 1815)The Scots Magazine Volume 62, 1800, page 72 On 21 November 1790, Peat was appointed to the Order of Saint Stanislaus by the King of Poland. His obituary says that he was appointed for services rendered to that king by a relative of Peat and his entry in the British Herald says that this was in connection to land willed to him by a John Vesey of Warsaw.The British Herald, 1830 Appendix PEA Peat's house was broken into on 25 October 1808 and papers relating to his Polish estates were reported stolen.The New annual register, 1808, page 146 In 1804, Peat was permitted by King George III to accept and wear the order's insignias. Appearing in court in 1808 after being attacked outside of the Drury Lane theatre, the defence objected to calling Peat \\"Sir\\" as he had not been appointed to any order of knighthood in the United Kingdom. However, the Lord Chief Justice, presiding, stated that knighthood was a \\"universal honour\\" and thus the appellation applied to him.Sporting Magazine, Volume 31, 1808, p.256A regulation introduced by the Prince Regent in 1813 stated that permission from the Sovereign to wear a foreign order does not entitle the holder to any rank or style, unless expressly stated in the Royal Warrant. Later tradition would also dictate that any clergyman appointed to an order of knighthood would not use the title of \\"sir\\" and they are not dubbed with a sword. Peat is also listed erroneously in some sources as being a Knight of the Order of Saint Patrick and a baronet, however he was not appointed either. Peat had also been a military chaplain in the Peninsular War.St John History, Proceedings of the St John Ambulance Historical Society of Australia, Volume 7, 2007-08, p.22-23 He was appointed a steward of Queen Charlotte's Lying-In Hospital in 1817,Plan of Queen Charlotte's lying-in hospital, 1823 page 61 elected a fellow of the Medico-Botanical Society of London in 1830The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 147, 1830 p544 and had married the author Lucy Clementina Davies and Francis Henry Davies at St Marylebone Parish Church in 1823.Annual register, 1824, page 176 Marriage and royal connections William Reid Clanny introduced Peat to the elderly and Catholic, Jane Smith (c. 1751-1842), a kinswoman of Maria Fitzherbert. Jane had been the sole heiress to the County Durham estates of her father and lived at Herrington House, East Herrington, near Sunderland. She was wealthy but is also described as eccentric, a miser and a kleptomaniac.Herrington Heritage - The Unsolved Murder Peat had been appointed as one of the many chaplains to the Prince Regent in 1800. He wrote to the Private Secretary in 1813 requesting an audience with the prince as he had never met him.The Letters of King George IV, Volumes 2-3, page 248 Herrington Heritage suggests Peat was supportive of a match with Jane in order to use her relationship (albeit distant) to the prince's unofficial wife, to further advance himself in royal favour. The source also suggests that Jane was taken with the idea of a title if she were to marry Peat. Whatever their reasons, the couple were married on 6 November 1815 at St Michael's Church, Houghton-le-Spring.Bishop of Durham's Transcripts for St Michael's, Houghton-le-Spring Peat had tried to introduce his wife to fashionable society in London, but as she was seemingly unfit for it, he returned her to Sunderland. He lived apart from her at his vicarage in New Brentford and visited her just once a year. Peat's other royal connections included being mentioned by Mary Anne Clarke (the mistress of the Duke of York) at her public enquiry, as having attended the theatre with her one night, but he was not involved any further in the case.The investigation of the charges brought against His Royal Highness the Duke of York, commander in chief, 1809, page 302 Peat was one of the stewards of the 49th birthday celebrations of the Duke of Kent at Fishmongers' Hall in 1816, but did not attend in person.The European Magazine, and London Review - Volume 70, 1816, p.450-1 He was also Deputy Grand Chaplain of the Orange Order and present at a meeting alongside the Duke of Cumberland.Select Committee on Orange Institutions in Great Britain and Colonies, p.235 Death and legacy Peat died at the vicarage of St Lawrence's in New Brentford on 20 April 1837, aged 65, and his library was sold at Sotheby's on 23 and 24 June.The Gentleman's Magazine (Vol. VIII, 1837), page 209 On hearing the news, his wife is said to have \\"bought a new dress of bright yellow cotton, and a bonnet, a feather, and ribbons to match\\" and walked the streets of Sunderland celebrating his death.The Monthly chronicle of North-country lore and legend (1887) She died in 1842, aged either 91 or 92. Samuel Wesley (in a letter to Vincent Novello dated 1824) called Peat \\"an old Acquaintance, & I may even say Friend of mine.

Previously, she had been in commission in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1963 to 1970 as USC&GS; Peirce (CSS 28). After her NOAA decommissioning, she was donated to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum for use as the floating classroom and archaeological research ship MV Elizabeth M. Foster. She was sold for private use in 1999 and in 2001 became the yacht MV Avedonia. Construction and commissioning launched by the Marietta Manufacturing Company at Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in October 1962. Peirce was built a cost of $2,300,000 (USD) as a \\"coastal survey ship\\" (CSS) for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey by the Marietta Manufacturing Company at Point Pleasant, West Virginia. She was launched in October 1962 and delivered in May 1963. The Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned her on 6 May 1963 at the Alabama State Docks in Mobile, Alabama, as USC&GS; Peirce (CSS 28), the first and only Coast and Geodetic Survey ship of the name. When the Coast and Geodetic Survey and other United States Government agencies merged to form NOAA on 3 October 1970, Peirce became a part of the NOAA fleet as NOAAS Peirce (S 328), thus far the only NOAA ship to bear the name. Capabilities Peirce had a two-drum oceanographic winch with a maximum pull of 1,500 pounds (680 kg). The upper drum had 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) of 0.3-inch (7.62-mm) electrical cable, while the lower drum had 15,000 feet (4,572 meters) of 5/16-inch (7.9-mm) cable. She had a 27-foot (8.2-meter) telescoping boom with a lifting capacity of 2,500 pounds (1,134 kg) and a 27-foot (8.2-meter) articulating boom with a lifting capacity of 2,768 pounds (1,256 kg), as well as a movable A-frame. For acoustic hydrography and bathymetry, the ship had a deep-water echosounder, a shallow-water echosounder-lOOKhz, and a hydrographic survey sounder. To process data, she had the National Ocean Services Hydrochart system, which employed a PDP/8E computer to acquire and process hydrographic data in real time, generate a real-time position-corrected plot of sounding data, provide steering commands to the helmsman, and generate a punched paper tape for shore-based processing of sounding dara. Peirce had an ice-strengthened steel hull. Peirce carried two 29-foot (8.8-meter) aluminum-hulled diesel-powered Jensen survey launches, each equipped with the same Hydrochart system as aboard Peirce. For utility and rescue purposes, she also carried two open boats with gasoline-powered outboard motors, a 16-foot (4.9-meter) Boston Whaler fiberglass-hulled boat and 17-foot (5.2-meter) Monark aluminum-hulled boat. Operational career From her home port at Norfolk, Virginia, Peirce conducted hydrographic and bathymetric surveys involving nautical charting and ocean mapping, primarily along the United States East Coast and United States Gulf Coast and off territories of the United States in the Caribbean. NOAA decommissioned Peirce on 1 May 1992. Floating classroom and yacht In 1992, Peirce was donated to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. The museum acquired her for use as a floating classroom and archaeological research ship and renamed her MV Elizabeth M. Foster in 1993.

It operates slot machines in locations such as bars, convenience stores, and grocery stores. It is owned by Century Gaming, a Montana-based slot route operator. For many years, United Coin was the largest slot route operator in Nevada. History United Coin was founded in 1958. Bernard Shapiro, who had owned a coin machine business in Northern California, and a small stake in the Royal Nevada casino, started the company after the Royal Nevada went out of business. Advanced Patent Technology purchased the company in 1979. In 1980, Advanced Patent reached an agreement to sell United Coin to Bristol Silver Mines Co. for $13 million in cash and stock. Advanced Patent withdrew from the offer three months later, though, saying that United Coin was now \\"more desirable\\". In 2000, United Coin's parent, now known as Alliance Gaming, agreed to sell the company for $112 million in cash plus $6 million in preferred stock to gaming developers Michael Luzich and Daniel Kehl. Alliance canceled the deal a year later due to increased profits at United Coin. In 2004, Century Gaming bought United Coin for $100 million cash plus $5 million in assumed debt. The company sold off its operations in Northern Nevada to another slot route operator in 2013, but then returned to the region in 2015, placing machines at a chain of sports bars. In July 2014, the company dropped the United Coin name and rebranded its operations in Nevada and Montana as Century Gaming Technologies.

Founded in the late 1920s as a merger of several companies involved in the switch from silent to sound films, the organisation emerged as a leading German sound studio.Kreimeier p.179 Tobis used the Tri-Ergon sound-on-disc system under the Tobis-Klang trade name. The Ufa production company had separate rights to the Tobis system, which it used under the trade name of Ufa-Klang. Some Tobis films were released in Germany by the subsidiary Europa Film. Its principal production studios were the Johannisthal Studios in Berlin. During the Nazi era , Tobis was one of the four major film companies along with Terra Film, Bavaria Film and UFA. In 1942 all these companies were merged into a single state-controlled industry bringing an end to Tobis' independent existence, though films continued to be released under the Tobis banner. International operations From 1933 until 1938, Tobis controlled the dominant Austrian producer Sascha-Film which was known as Tobis-Sascha. From 1932, it also owned a majority share of one of the main Portuguese producers known as Tobis Portuguesa, a name which the company kept even after the German participation was terminated at the end of world War II. Tobis established a Paris subsidiary and produced French-language film at the Epinay Studios during the 1930s. Among the directors under contract to the company was Ren√© Clair who produced the films Under the Roofs of Paris and Le Million during the early sound era. Legacy One of the studio's employees Horst Wendlandt later (1971) founded a new distribution company which is also known as Tobis.Bergfelder p.439 In 2016, the present-day Tobis became an investor in Globalgate Entertainment.

The fire, which started in 1946 and was eventually contained by the 1970s, caused at least two fatalities and millions of dollars of property damage. Site description The Carbondale mine fire is located in the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. It is in the vicinity of an apartment complex consisting of eleven three-story buildings. The dump where the fire started was in former strip mine pits of the Hudson Coal Company's Powderly Mine. The pits had dirt and outcroppings of rock containing hidden coal. The Carbondale mine fire spread considerably faster than the Centralia mine fire in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, but was somewhat smaller. Unlike many mine fires, the Carbondale mine fire lacked \\"noxious odors\\". There are, however, irregular snowmelts in the area, which is typical of mine fires. 32 of the boreholes installed by the Office of Surface Mining in 1986 have 6-inch internal diameter casings and the remaining two have 4 inch casings. Physical and geological description There are at least six coal seams in the vicinity of the Carbondale Mine fire. The major seams in the area include the Grassy seam, the New County seam, the Clark seam, the Dunmore Seam #1, the Dunmore Seam #2, and the Dunmore Seam #3. The temperature of the coal in the Carbondale mine fire ranges from to . The carbon monoxide concentration of the Carbondale mine fire ranges from nearly 0% to approximately 0.4%. The concentration of methane can be as high as 500 parts per million. By the mid-1950s, the Carbondale mine fire occupied an area of 120 acres and burned as far down as . The top in the area of the fire consisted of rock and wash. Below this, there were five or six coal seams ranging from thick and interspersed with layers of slate and sand. The temperature of the fire was as high as ; hot enough to melt the thermometers used to gauge the temperature. In the 1960s, the area of the fire was inhabited by 1300 people. Early history The Carbondale mine fire began in either 1943 or 1946 when a fire in Carbondale's city dump spread to nearby mine workings. It is unknown if the fire was natural or man-made. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a number of minor unsuccessful attempts were made to stop the fire by flooding the burning mine workings. It was the first time that an attempt to excavate a mine fire of that size had been made. In the 1950s, boreholes were dug around the perimeter of the fire and filled with a variety of materials, including sediment and sand. In this decade, an attempt was made to dig out the fire. In 1956, it was projected to take three years, but it continued into the 1960s and caused significant property damage. During the excavation, large amounts of coal were removed from the area. During the excavation, the fire nearly spread to the east side or downtown part of Carbondale, but was successfully contained. The first fatalities of the fire occurred in 1952, when the fire spread under the house of a couple and asphyxiated them with carbon monoxide. Some time later, several dozen people were poisoned by carbon monoxide from the fire, but there were no fatalities. In 1959, the federal government designated the West Side of Carbondale as an \\"urban redevelopment district\\" due to the Carbondale mine fire. In 1960, evacuation began in the vicinity of the Carbondale mine fire and over the following decade, mine experts acknowledged the fire's continued spread. Around this time, a proposal was made to drain nearby lakes to use those waters to flood the fire, citing a project cost of $100,000. Another plan proposed smothering the fire with dry ice, an option deemed impractical due to the fire's large size. Later history The Carbondale mine fire was extinguished or contained by 1972 or 1974. In 1986, 34 boreholes were installed at the site of the Carbondale mine fire by the Office of Surface Mining. As of 2000, the site of the Carbondale mine fire is checked regularly to verify its containment. The fire forced approximately 1000 residents to evacuate, caused millions of dollars in damage, and destroyed approximately 500 buildings. Media response The Carbondale mine fire received notoriety in local newspapers in its early years, and excavation attempts of the 1950s and 1960s were covered in the May 1960 issue of Popular Science magazine. The Saturday Evening Post featured a story on the fire in 1963, saying that the excavation effort was moving more earth than the construction of the Panama Canal.

History Coal was mined in the area around Aldrich beginning in 1839. In 1875, Truman H. Aldrich purchased the town surrounding the mines and named it Aldrich. He leased the mining operations to his younger brother, William F. Aldrich, who was married to Josephine Cables Aldrich, spiritualist, Theosophist, editor, and publisher. Convict labor was employed at some time during the operation of Aldrich's coal mines, and is mentioned in Douglas Blackmon's Slavery By Another Name. A prison was built to house the convicts, and the convict cemetery is located near where the prison once stood. The community was once home to churches, a school, and houses that were all built by the operators of the mines. A post office was established in 1883, with William Aldrich as the first postmaster, and was in use until it was closed in 1965. From 1895 to 1902, Aldrich had a locally published newspaper, The Alabama time-piece. The mines were closed on July 5, 1942. Today, Aldrich is home to the Aldrich Coal Mine Museum.

It encompasses a neighborhood area that typifies the growth of the city between about 1890 and 1940. When first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, it consisted of properties on Clifton Street between Cleveland and Dallas Avenues, and on Greening Street between Cleveland and Spring Avenues. The district has been enlarged three times, each time to add a few additional properties. The Clifton and Greening Street area did not see any significant development until the 1890s. The oldest surviving houses in the district is the c. 1890 Queen Anne style Greening House (512 Greening Street), which was followed in the first decade of the 20th century by a number of large and stylish Colonial Revival houses. The regional oil boom of the 1920s brought new construction, mainly Craftsman in style, while a third wave of building occurred in the pre- and post-World War II period. The district has three institutional buildings. The Garrison Auditorium, built in 1939, is the only surviving remnant of the Clevaland School, and is still used for community functions. It is connected via a covered passage to a modern school administration building. The third non- residential building is the Corner Grocery at Clifton and Cleveland, built in the 1920s. One natural feature is also included in the district: a deep ravine at the eastern end of the district is said to contain the only spring in the city limits.

The co-op was founded in 1998, as Ontario's first carsharing program, under the name The People's Car Co- operative Inc.. At the 2014 AGM, the members of the co-op voted to change the incorporated name to Community CarShare Co-operative, Inc. History =Founding years 1998-2005= Community CarShare began in Waterloo Region on April 1, 1998. It was started by a group of 10 friends who had a car donated to them, but didn't want to deal with the costs of car ownership. The first car was located in the City of Waterloo, near the corner of Bridgeport and Peppler street. =Local expansion 2005-2009= In Fall 2007, the co-op expanded its service into Cambridge when it added a tenth vehicle to the fleet. As part of the growth into Cambridge, the organization updated its operating name from The People's Car Co-op to Grand River CarShare, to reflect the environmental benefits of carsharing and to localize the name of the co- op. =Province wide expansion 2009-2014 = In April 2009, the co-op's geographic borders expanded again when a group of Hamiltonians decided to join the co-op and expand service to that city under the co-op's second operating name, Hamilton CarShare. In less than five months, 50 new members were recruited, and three vehicles were launched in Hamilton in September 2009. Expansion to St. Catharines and Guelph in 2013 led to the adoption of the name Community CarShare in order to simplify the use of the name and convey the values of the organization. There are currently 76 vehicles available to members, with the majority of them located in Kitchener-Waterloo. The fleet includes many vehicles such as the Toyota Yaris, Corolla, Matrix, Prius C, plug-in Prius, Tacoma, the fully electric Mitsubishi i-MiEV, a Ford Transit Connect cargo van, Mazda 5 station wagon, and Dodge Caravan mini van. =Rural expansion= Community CarShare expanded to rural Elmira (population ~8,000 people) north of Waterloo.

History National Historical Landmark marker Founded on March 7, 1793 by Archbishop Antonio Gallego of Manila, Holy Rosary Minor Seminary started as Casa de Clerigos (House of Clerics) in a place called Padian (now, Caceres St.) near the Bicol River. It was canonically erected as Seminario Conciliar de Nueva Caceres in compliance with the Tridentine Decree that every diocese must have a seminary. In 1840, it was transferred from Padian to its present site along Elias Angeles St. When the seminary building opened in 1793 it was made of wood, bamboo and nipa which a certain bishop noted as \\"combustible and of non-durable materials\\". The initial staff was composed of a rector (provisor and vicar general of the diocese); a vice-rector(a Franciscan professor) and two other professors who taught Latin and Humanities. In nine years after its opening, it had 11 deacons, 24 subdeacon and 247 minor seminarians. In 1855, the seminary building was damaged by a strong earthquake and a fire razed it the ground in 1863. In 1865, Nueva Caceres Bishop Francisco Gainza, O.P. rebuilt and expanded the new seminary building. The Vincentian Fathers (C.M.) took over the management and formation of the seminary in 1865 to become a seminary-college and center of education for lay people in Southern Luzon. In 1925, Bishop Francisco Reyes renamed it as Seminario del Santissimo Rosario and abolished the College and retained the Conciliar Seminary. It was partly damaged when it was bombed by the Japanese during the second war. In 1964, it was renamed Holy Rosary Minor Seminary under the new management of Diocese of Clegy. In 1970, a powerful typhoon extensively damaged the Seminary and was rebuilt under the leadership of Archbishop Teopisto Alberto. It was declared as a National Historical Landmark on June 11, 1978 by then National Historical Institute as a tribute to its having produced martyrs, patriots and heroes like Jose Maria Panganiban, Tomas Arejola and nine of the fifteen Bikol Martyrs namely, Gabriel Prieto, P. Severino Diaz, Leon Hernandez, Mariano Ordinanza, Mariano Arana, Camilo Jacob, Ramon Abella, Domingo Abella and Tomas Prieto. Among its prominent alumni are Bishop Jorgr Barlin, the first Filipino Bishop, Jose Tomas Cardinal Sanchez and 21 other bishops in the country. On September 5, 1988 the late Archbishop Leonardo Legaspi renamed it back to Holy Rosary Minor Seminary and inaugurated the Museo del Seminario Conciliar de Nueva Caceres which houses altars and statues, books and vestments used by bishops and priests. Description The Ecclesiastical Museum The Archeological Museum The two-storey brick structure is rectangular in plan with eclectic Italian Renaissance ornamentation. Its composition is symmetrical with a central block and indented right and left wings. Its ground floor facade is a series of brick arches quite similar to Florentine Renaissance architecture. On the roof level is a brick cornice above the frieze composed of triglyphs and regula, elements from classical Greek Architecture. The frieze is supported by a stylized Doric crenelated brick pilaster. The second floor facade has verandahs supported by a projection of brick cornices with ornamental ironwork fern design ledge. The doors are topped by corniced rain-stopper. On October 17, 2003, the late Archbishop Legaspi opened the Bishop Domingo Collantes Library with a 30,000-book collection and can sit 100 readers in its 280 sq. m. hall. The seminary offers Junior High School (Grades 7‚Äì10) and Senior High School (Grades 11‚Äì12) in accordance with the K-12 curriculum.

Its appearance and lifestyle mimics that of a sponge. It was discovered in 2013 in underwater caves 30 miles off the coast of Spain. Description At () long, Spiculosiphon oceana is the largest foraminifera found in the Mediterranean. The species creates a test (shell) made out of sponge spicules, \\"gluing\\" them together with a protein it secretes, much like sponges do. The spicules it uses are carefully selected and laid parallel to the main stalk of the creature. Because of its large size and its appearance, S. oceana was originally mistaken as a multi-cellular animal from the sponge family. Spiculosiphon oceana lives on the sea floor. It lies in wait and extends its pseudopods outside its shell to capture prey, primarily plankton, that get trapped on the spicules of its shell. Thus, it captures prey much in the same way as carnivorous sponges. In addition to the visual and lifestyle similarities of S. oceana and sponges, the creatures live in similar habitats. Thus, it is likely a case on convergent evolution dictated by the environmental constraints. In May 2014, The International Institute for Species Exploration selected S. oceana as one of the Top 10 New Species of the previous year. Discovery and taxonomic history Spiculosiphon oceana was on the Seco de Palos seamount, southeast of Spain. It was formally described in the June 10, 2013 issue of Zootaxa. The specific name is a reference to the non-profit group Oceana who co-discovered the species with Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Blanes (CEAB-CSIC). Spiculosiphon oceana is the second species of Spiculosiphon, the first being Spiculosiphon radiata. S. oceana is roughly twice the size of its sister species, which was found in Norway.

Dolores Regino‚Äôs creations are made from a variety of gourd called cucurbita, which has a hard shell especially when dried, and comes in a variety of shapes and sizes which he uses to create various figures and objects. Finished products include toys such as carrousels, Ferris wheels, animal figures (birds, fish, armadillos etc.) as well as boxes and other storage containers for small items such as sewing supplies and jewelry. He also makes nativity scenes. Dolores Regino works with his son-in-law Julio Santos at their workshop and property where the crafts are made from growing the gourds to the finished product. After the various sizes and types of gourd are harvested, the insides are cleaned out and the hard shell is left to dry. The outer shell is lacquered with chia (preferably), linseed or other oil, and then painted with tlapilole, a powder with coloring that serves as the base. The piece is then burnished to make sure the tlapilole is well-set and the process is repeated to make sure the gourd is well sealed.

It is a horror game drawing inspiration from the lead designer Matt Gilgenbach's personal struggles with obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder and depression; in an interview, he stated that he was \\"trying to create that feeling [of bleakness and hopelessness] in Neverending Nightmares\\".  Gameplay  The player takes the role of Thomas, a man who \\"wakes up\\" from one nightmare and into another. As the player navigates Thomas throughout the game, the nightmares become progressively worse, including the horrifying monsters that lurk within them. Each time Thomas dies in a nightmare, comes across some serious cause of depression, or commits self-harm, he will \\"wake up\\" again in either the same nightmare as before, or into a different one. This acts as the game's checkpoint and save system. The game contains a total of three different endings, all influenced by the player's choices or paths that they take. The game features a 2D hand-drawn line art style heavily influenced by the works of Edward Gorey. It uses a minimalist user interface, forgoing onscreen prompts and loading screens during play in order to increase immersion.http://steamcommunity.com/id/StacheSplosion/recommended/253330/ Plot =Setting and characters= Neverending Nightmares revolves around Thomas Smith, a young man who is suffering from a seemingly-endless string of nightmares (hence the title). Another character, Gabby, is introduced as Thomas' little sister, and frequently appears in his nightmares, occasionally changing roles. At turning points in the game, Thomas finds Gabby dead in various situations; Thomas himself also dies in his nightmares, sometimes by his own hand, though this only leads him to wake up in yet another nightmare. Throughout the game, which is implied to be set in the late 1800s, Thomas must explore various locations in his nightmares. These include a mansion, a cemetery, an insane asylum, a forest, and a hospital. =Story= The game begins with Thomas \\"waking up\\" from a nightmare, in which he had stabbed his younger sister Gabby in the stomach. As he wanders through each nightmare, \\"waking up\\" in a bed each time, the player sees Thomas commit gruesome acts of self-harm out of depression, such as pulling a blood vessel or even a bone out of his arm. Depending on the player's actions, Thomas will finally wake up into one of three different endings. * Wayward Dreamer: after waking up, a young Thomas goes to Gabby's room, where he kisses his sleeping sister good- night.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xke58wkC4vE * Destroyed Dreams: after escaping a nightmarish version of himself, Thomas slowly awakens in a hospital, his arms bandaged and bloody. Gabby, either as his sister or wife, begs him to wake up, and rejoices when he finally does. * The Final Descent: an adult Thomas wakes up at his desk, where he reads a letter from Gabrielle, his wife. After the loss of their daughter, Gabrielle was forced to leave Thomas, as he couldn't get over the tragedy. After reading the letter, Thomas quietly weeps in his chair. A portrait on the wall implies that the girl murdered at the beginning was his daughter, not Gabrielle.  Development  In September 2013, a Kickstarter campaign for the game's development was successfully funded, raising $106,722 of its original $99,000 goal. The game was released on Steam and Ouya on September 26, 2014.  Reception  = Pre- release = Neverending Nightmares received largely positive buzz during the course of its development. Adam Sessler said it was \\"very, very interesting\\" after playing an early build at the Penny Arcade Expo. He compared it to Gone Home in how it told a story personally relevant to its creator. IGN included it on a list of its most anticipated horror games for 2014, emphasizing its \\"wonderfully-distinct, pen-and-ink style.\\" It was nominated by The Escapist as one of the best games of E3 2014. = Post-release = The game for PC received a score of 68/100 at Metacritic indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Smangaliso Simelane praised the game's \\"spooky soundtrack composed of twinkling piano notes and ominous synthetic whines.\\" Giant Bomb nominated it for Best-Looking Game and Best Horror Game of 2014. =Sales= In April 2015, it was reported that Neverending Nightmares had sold around 22,000 copies across all platforms, and that it had generated around $250,000 in revenue.

In Spanish, it is known as ''''', or \\"tiger spider\\", but is also well known as \\"long-legged spider\\" (because of the disproportional size of those members) or \\"spitting spider\\" (because of its hunting methods, in which it projects an extremely sticky web which immobilizes its prey). It has achieved fame by being the only natural predator of the extremely common and dangerous Chilean recluse spider (Loxosceles laeta).  Description and habitat  The Chilean tiger spider's size varies from 30 up to 70 mm in the adult state. Its body is small (specially if compared to the size of its legs, which are usually between three and four times the size of its body). It has slow movements and it hunts only at night. The spider is native to South America (it is more common in Chile, but can be found in other parts of South America, specifically in Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia). It lives mostly inside houses in dark and hidden places such as behind frames, in closets, etc. But it can also be found outdoors. Hunting method The hunting method of the Chilean tiger spider is quite characteristic and it is the origin of one of its nicknames, the spitting spider. At night, the spider stealthily approaches its prey and then contracts its abdomen projecting an extremely sticky and resistant spider-web, which imprisons its prey even if it is larger than the spider; then, once the prey is verified to be immobilized, the spider injects its poison, secreted from its second venom gland. Prey The Chilean tiger spider preys on flies, mosquitoes, bees, horse-flies, and other insects. However it also eats other kinds of spiders, and it has become famous for being the only natural predator of the common and dangerous recluse spider (Loxosceles laeta). Webs The Chilean tiger spider builds barely elaborated spider-webs and only in its refuges. Bites It is extremely unlikely for the Chilean tiger spider to attack beings that are more than twice its size (mainly because of its hunting methods), so an attack on a human being has almost no chance of happening. It has been declared by several studies of Chilean Universities to be \\"innocuous to human beings\\". There are no clinical records of attacks on humans. Relationship with the Chilean recluse spider Even if the tiger spider is famous for preying on the recluse spider, University of Chile's studies have shown that only 50% of encounters between the two kinds of spider result in a fight between them, out of which only 75% result in the tiger spider actually killing the recluse spider. The title of natural predator of the recluse spider is therefore open to doubt.

The arrow pierces through Kyary's chest. She is completely surprised and dies on the spot. Her soul leaves her motionless body through an out of body experience and she is taken to the afterlife. Kyary then explores the area and a guardian appears. The guardian demonstrates his power to Kyary by showing her he is both in front of her as well as turning into a giant and holding her in his hand. She is very surprised and removes her mask. The next scene shows Kyary dancing around. Next, she is walking on a surface with a globe design supported by three elephants on a turtle. The guardian and Kyary stare at an apple falling off a tree. When the apple falls, it is shown that they are standing on a globe shaped like an apple. A snake twisting around the apple carries Kyary away and swallows her. She then slides out of the snake's body. The guardian and Kyary then look at a ball bouncing back and forth. She then does some calculations and realizes that E=mc^2. The guardian calls forth lightning, and a hoverboard is created where the lightning hits the ground. Kyary steps on the hoverboard then rides through a vortex with the guardian. As she hops off, sparkling lights appear and her outfit changes from dark to a white and more feminine outfit. She then jumps for joy on a flower. Her soul returns to her body. In the end, Kyary is shown wielding the bow and arrow that pierced her heart in the beginning. Due to intense movement of scenario and involving song, some people reported EMDR side effects, including a sense of discomfort after repeated exposure. =Creation= The general plot of the video clip can be described as Kyary being struck down by an arrow of love, having an out of body experience, then achieving enlightenment through her time in the world of death, all in typical Kyary humor. Video clip director Jun Tamukai (Áî∞ÂêëÊΩ§) from the outstart floated the idea \\"Let's have Kyary die\\", which Kyary supported saying she'd like to do something around dark fantasy. The pre-plot of the video clip became \\"Kyary learns the secret of the world in the afterlife\\". Kyary commented \\"I wanted to have a theme that turns around the theme of glittery kawaii pop, and show a darker fantasy theme including a glittery assassin\\" (kirakira is a phenomimetic expression for glitter or glisten, kiraa is the word 'killer' assimilated into Japanese). The first part of the song shows a verse/bridge structure with religious and spiritual themes, such as skeletons, eggs, whereas the second part is more anchored in science demonstrating the law of gravity and relativity. Scrupulously following schedule, the video clip was shot during two days in May 2014. The two outfits that Kyary wears took two weeks to make. The first costume is eerie and ominous, a costume with a dark theme that Kyary didn't show until that point. The lumpy styrene on the skirt and arms shaped like rain clouds, with a contrastive silvery mask and body protection, shows Kyary fighting in the other world. The outfit she wears in the conclusion, shows \\"Kyary Pamyu Pamyu having achieved enlightenment - Evolution\\". To express the movement and franticness of the music, video-clip director Jun Tamukai used the 4D Views technology. This special technology scans and records the movements of the actor at the millisecond scale, and enables the replacement of complex camera work involving cranes with a computer rendering. However, to ensure image quality, the director only used this technology for far away shots, and actual actor footage for close-ups. Special care had to be taken to hide the transition between the two. The scene where Kyary stands in front of a row of speakers singing her heart out is an hommage to Asian Kung Fu Generation's singer Masafumi Gotoh (ÂæåËó§ Ê≠£Êñá) and the music video for their song Rewrite. During the filming, the staff shouted her to \\"Sing it like Gottchi!\\". The stylist for the music video was Iijima Kumiko (È£ØÂ∂ã‰πÖÁæéÂ≠ê). =Themes= In an interview, video clip director Jun Tamukai said there is no need to explain the themes and construction for the clip, since it is possible to figure out most of them by oneself. The list could therefore be considered a spoiler and no replacement for personal interpretation. The video clip references: * death  Kyary dies at the beginning of the video clip  a skeleton is present  the world is set in the afterworld, with a guardian spirit guiding Kyary  Kyary has an out of body experience and sees a blinding light faraway * religion  Christian crosses are present, as well as an apple and snake from the garden of Eden  buddhism, through the themes of rebirth, the presence of flowers shaped like lotus, as well as the reference to Journey to the West  the ying and yang of Chinese philosophy  shintoism, through the animal shaped guardian spirit  the Greek god of love Eros, with the arrow shaped like a heart * science  the apple falling from the tree references Newton's discovery of the law of gravitation  E=mc2 expresses the duality of energy and matter, shown when Kyary sings 'ki ga tsuite' (to realize), the guardian uses the law to create a matter hoverboard from lightning energy  The ball (a photon) bouncing between two lines (reflective surfaces) is also a common toy model for demonstrating time dilation in an accelerating reference frame - and is loosely related to the mass-energy equivalence equation.

Her parents, Arthur Walder and Millie, n√©e Bowen, were part of a prominent and wealthy family; her uncle Sir Samuel was Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1932 and later served as a United Australia Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. Sir William McMahon, Prime Minister from 1971 to 1972, was one of her cousins. She received a Bachelor of Arts in 1947 from the University of Sydney and a diploma in social studies in 1950. In 1952 she married Royal Navy officer Michael Kersey, and moved around with him to Scotland, Malta and New Zealand; on his retirement, they settled in Armidale to manage a grazing property. There Kersey became involved in organisations such as the Save the Children Fund, Family Planning, and Zero Population Growth, and joined the Australia Party, forerunner of the Australian Democrats. Kersey stood as the Australia Party's candidate at the 1973 Armidale by-election for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. After her separation from her husband, Kersey moved back to Sydney and became involved in the nuclear disarmament, women's rights and conservation movements. She ran three times for the House of Representatives seat of Wentworth for the Democrats, in 1977, 1980, and the 1981 by-election. Kersey was also a Democrat candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Council at the 1978 election. After retiring from social work she studied at the University of New England and gained a Master of Letters. Kersey published four books: High Society: The Legalisation of Illicit Drugs (1994), The New Aged: An Untapped Resource (1997), 2050: A Drug Odyssey (2002), and her autobiography, My Life: While Busy Making Other Plans (2006). A member of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Amnesty International, Justice Action, the Friends of the United Nations, and Community Action Abroad, her activism continued into her 70s and 80s, campaigning for a republic and a carbon price and against the Iraq War and the treatment of refugees.

Blochmannia is a genus of symbiotic bacteria found in carpenter ant. There are over 1000 species of these ants and, as of 2014, of the over 30 species of carpenter ant that have been investigated, all contain some form of Blochmannia. The bacteria filled cells currently known as members of the genus Blochmannia were first discovered by zoologist F. Blochmann in the ovaries and midguts of insects in the 1880s. In 2000 Candidatus Blochmannia was proposed as its own genus. Endosymbiosis, or when the Blochmannia bacteria and the ant hosts became bonded, occurred around 30‚Äì40 million years ago. In comparing two species of Blochmannia that diverged evolutionarily around 15-20 million years ago, the extreme similarity between their genes means Blochmannia bacteria have high levels of genetic conservation. The high amounts of genetic conservation suggest that the Blochmannia genes lack some recombination mechanisms. Blochmannia bacteria are found in the midguts of carpenter ants, as well as the ovaries of the female carpenter ants. Blochmannia is important in synthesizing essential and non essential amino acids, including tyrosine, and it helps the ant to process nitrogen. The Blochmannia bacteria improves the ants‚Äô nutrition and, in doing this, it is also important to the overall health of the ant colony. According to the study by Zientz et al., Blochmannia improves the health of the colony of ants as a whole because worker ants use a \\"trophallaxis and regurgitation\\" system to provide the colony with food. When control colonies which had Blochmannia were compared to groups where the worker ants had been given antibiotics to reduce their levels of Blochmannia , the health of the control colony was superior. Zientz proposes that this superior fitness of the control ant colonies is likely due to Blochmannia improving the nutritional quality of the food that worker ants supply to the young ants, as the health effects of Blochmannia appear to decrease with the ant's maturation. Blochmannia bacteria are sensitive to heat. In one experiment, when exposed to an increased heat of 99.87 ¬∞F (37.7 ¬∞C) for 4 weeks, over 99% of Blochmannia disappeared. However, even after 16 weeks exposure of this heat exposure, trace small amounts of Blochmannia survived. According to researchers Fan and Wernegreen, this experiment suggests that the Blochmannia in ants could be vulnerable to the effects of global warming.

It was established in May 1869. Adana Vilayet bordered with Konya Vilayet (in west), Ankara Vilayet and Sivas Vilayet (in north), and Haleb Vilayet (in east and south). Adana Vilayet corresponds to the modern region of √áukurova in Turkey.

Economic history It was described by the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as rich in unexploited mineral wealth in the mountainous districts, and fertile in the coast-plain, which produced cotton, rice, cereals, sugar and fruit. In 1920, the region was noted for its forested western region, which had little agricultural production. The Cilicia region was noted for its agricultural production, including wheat, barley, oats, rice, seeds, opium, sugarcane and cotton. Cotton production became more popular before World War I. In 1912, the region produced 110,000 bales of cotton and 35,000 tons of cottonseed. Pyrite was mined in the region in the early 20th century.

It is also described as an ontological approach that seeks to eliminate simple binaries between seemingly opposing phenomena such as nature and culture. The concept was originally coined by the Polish-American philosopher and sociologist Florian Znaniecki in his book Cultural Reality (1919) in English and later translated into Polish as kulturalizm. Znaniecki had introduced a similar concept in earlier Polish language publications which he described as humanism (humanizm).Dulczewski (1984), pp. 186‚Äì187. Origins Znaniecki's culturalism was based on philosophies and theories of Matthew Arnold (Culture and Anarchy), Friedrich Nietzsche (voluntarism), Henri Bergson (creative evolutionism), Wilhelm Dilthey (philosophy of life), William James, John Dewey (pragmatism) and Ferdinand C. Schiller (humanism). He synthesized their theses and developed an original humanistic stance, which was first presented in Cultural Reality. Znaniecki's philosophy favored the advantages of rational, systematic knowledge. He also attempted to reconcile the threads of the phenomenological and pragmatic views to counter naturalism. Aside from naturalism,Ha≈Ças (2010), p. 21. Znaniecki was critical of a number of then-prevalent philosophical viewpoints: intellectualism,Ha≈Ças (2010), p. 52. idealism, realism, and rationalism. He was also critical of irrationalism and intuitionism. His criticisms became the bases of a new theoretical framework in the form of culturalism.Sztompka (2002), pp. 52‚Äì53. Characteristics Znaniecki's \\"culturalism\\" was an ontological and epistemological approach aiming to eliminate dualisms such as the belief that nature and culture are opposite realities. This approach allowed him to \\"define social phenomena in cultural terms\\". Znaniecki was arguing for the importance of culture, noting that our culture shapes our view of the world and our thinking.Dulczewski (1984), pp. 187‚Äì188. Znaniecki notes that while the world is composed of physical artifacts, we are not really capable of studying the physical world other than through the lenses of culture.Dulczewski (1984), p. 189. Among the fundamental aspects of the philosophy of culturalism are two categories: value and action. El≈ºbieta Ha≈Ças, who calls it an \\"antithesis to the intellectual dogmas of naturalism\\", identifies the following assumptions: * \\"The subject-object dualism must be overcome and thought should be united with reality.\\" * \\"Reality is not an absolute order but changes in a creative evolution.\\" * \\"All images of the world are relative.\\" * \\"It is false to oppose nature and culture or to subordinate culture to nature.\\" * \\"Value is the most general category of the description of reality.\\" Znaniecki's philosophy of culturalism laid the foundation for his larger theoretical system, based around another concept of his, \\"humanistic coefficient.\\"Ha≈Ças (2010), pp. 55, 172. Though originally a philosophical concept, culturalism was further developed by Znaniecki to inform his sociological theories.Ha≈Ças (2010), p. 51. Znaniecki's culturalism influenced modern sociological views of antipositivism and antinaturalism.Sztompka (2002), p. 2425.

The series was released in late 2013 through Fearnet's website and was released onto DVD on March 18, 2014 through Image Entertainment. Holland had initially planned for Twisted Tales to have thirteen episodes, but had to cut four episodes because of budgetary and time constraints. He later released those in script format. He has stated that he is unsure as to whether or not he will continue the series, but that if he did he would prefer to make each episode at least 30 minutes in length. Synopsis Each episode begins with Tom Holland introducing the short and the basic plot of each episode, with the only exception being Vampire Dance, where Holland appears as a janitor and makes several comments as the episode progresses. The shorts are all self-contained and are unrelated to one another in any aspect other than Holland serving as the opening narrator. Episodes Reception Critical reception for Twisted Tales has been mixed. Fangoria and Twitch Film both gave the DVD anthology mostly positive reviews and Twitch Film noted that \\"As with nearly every anthology series out there, there are high notes and low notes.\\" We Got This Covered and Dread Central both expressed disappointment over the collection in comparison to Holland's previous work and Dread Central opined that the DVD collection would have been stronger if Holland had condensed the work and included only the stronger pieces, as the weaker shorts dragged the others down.

Plot summary Harrison Brown is a young doctor who is a couple of years removed from medical school and has gone through his father's modest inheritance trying to set up his private practice. An old friend, Tony Mitchell, who was a lawyer that had a casual professional relationship with Brown's father, visits him one day and after catching up offers to co-sign a loan to help Brown get his private practice off the ground. He also offers to send some clients Brown's way. Kurt and Karen Gresham are two such clients. Kurt is an older man, over twice Karen's age, and Karen is a young beauty. A social relationship between the four takes them out of the medical office, and Brown soon starts an affair with Karen, who he suspects correctly is also having an affair with Tony. One evening, Kurt shows up at Brown's office with a young woman who has a gunshot wound. Brown fixes it up, but Kurt tells him to not report the incident. A short time later, Brown goes out to dinner with Tony and Karen and arrives home to find a dead woman in his apartment. He had never met her, but soon suspects Kurt is tied up with this. The women had, according to Kurt, committed suicide via heroin overdose and was placed in Brown's apartment to show Brown what Kurt was capable of. It is at this time that Kurt reveals he is a heroin dealer and compels Brown, under duress, to serve as his doctor whenever his business requires a doctor who will not report an incident to authorities. To further entice Brown to agree, Kurt pays off the $30,000 loan Brown took out, and gives him an addition $25,000 dollar, totalling over $400,000 dollars when adjust for inflation. Both men, though, are being manipulated by Tony and Karen. Karen reveals to Brown that she wants to marry him and plants the idea in Brown's head that Kurt must be killed in order to preserve their safety. He agrees to do this, but when he arrives to kill Kurt at the hotel where Kurt is staying, Brown is unable to pull the trigger. The hotel's security arrives, claiming that he had received a call that shots had been fired, though they hadn't. Karen had placed the call, planning on Kurt being killed and Brown being arrested so that she would be free to marry Tony. Both Kurt and Brown return to Kurt's home and hide out, waiting for Tony and Karen to arrive home. Once their conversation has confirmed Kurt's suspicions, Kurt shoots and kills both, adding second shots to each of their heads. He then turns the gun on Brown, who tackles Kurt. Kurt has a heart attack and dies. Afterward Brown calls the police and confesses the entire story, but police press do not charges as he is able to help them bring down the international drug ring with which Kurt was working. 1963 American novels Novels by Ellery Queen ","title":"Kill As Directed"},{"id":"42940491","title":"Coal (Kathy Mattea album)"},{"id":"42940492","text":"Tree of Stars is a self-released EP by the alternative rock band Failure.

The Hospices de Beaune or H√¥tel-Dieu de Beaune is a former charitable almshouse in Beaune, France. It was founded in 1443 by Nicolas Rolin, chancellor of Burgundy, as a hospital for the poor. The original hospital building, the H√¥tel-Dieu, one of the finest examples of fifteenth-century Burgundian architecture, is now a museum. Services for patients are now provided in modern hospital buildings. An important charity wine auction is held in November each year (formerly in the great hall of the H√¥tel-Dieu). History Polychrome roof of the Hospices de Beaune. The H√¥tel- Dieu was founded on 4 August 1443, when Burgundy was ruled by Duke Philip the Good. The Hundred Years' War had recently been brought to a close by the signing of the Treaty of Arras in 1435. Massacres, however, continued with marauding bands (√©corcheurs) still roaming the countryside, pillaging and destroying, provoking misery and famine. The majority of the people of Beaune were declared destitute. Nicolas Rolin, the Duke's Chancellor, and his wife Guigone de Salins, responded by building a hospital and refuge for the poor.Lane (1989), 167 The majority of the population of Beaune were destitute, and the area had recently suffered an outbreak of plague. Having gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, the hospice was built and consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the \\"Les s≈ìurs hospitali√®res de Beaune\\" religious order.Blum (1969), 37 The building's design was probably overseen by the Flemish architect Jacques Wiscr√®re and remained as a hospital until the late 1970s.Blum (1969)\\"Un visite √† l'H√¥tel-Dieu de Beaune\\". Soci√©t√© d'histoire et d'arch√©ologie de Beaune, 1912. 173‚Äì77 There is a documentary record of a large range of Flemish and French masons, painters and glass cutters employed for its construction. The facade is today regarded as a superior example of Northern Renaissance civic architecture and a treasure trove of panel painting, given its numerous portraits of Rolin, his wife and members of his extended family.Sinclair (1990), 21 The Hospices de Beaune consists of a pair of two-storied buildings arranged around a stone courtyard. The building wings are well-preserved today; they contain half- timber galleries and ornate rooftops with dormer windows. The hospital is arranged so that the wings served the office, kitchen and apothecary functions. The nuns and patients were housed nearer the chapel, towards the center of the complex.Smith (2004), 92 The Hospices de Beaune received the first patient on 1 January 1452. Elderly, disabled and sick people, with orphans, women about to give birth and the destitute have all been uninterruptedly welcomed for treatment and refuge from the Middle Ages until today. This Catholic institution focused on healing both the body and spirit of its patients. Over the centuries, the hospital radiated outwards, grouping with similar establishments in the surrounding villages of Pommard, Nolay, Meursault. Many donations - farms, property, woods, works of art and of course vineyards - were made to it, by grateful families and generous benefactors. The institution is one of the best and oldest examples of historical, philanthropic, and wine-producing heritage, and has become linked with the economic and cultural life of Burgundy. Interior Room of the Poor The interior's rectangular format makes it the best location to admire the different buildings, three of which are decorated with a glazed-tile roof. This technique probably has its origins in Central Europe (possibly from ceramics master Mikl√≥s Zsolnay of P√©cs, Hungary) but quickly became a trademark of the architecture of Burgundy (other glazed-tile roofs can be seen in Dijon, for instance). There are four colours of tiles, (red, brown, yellow and green) arranged to form interlaced designs. The current tiles are replicas dating from between 1902 and 1907. The Northern, Eastern and Western buildings include a two-level gallery with stone columns on the ground floor and wood beams on the first floor. Many dormer and attic windows can be observed with finely detailed wood and iron works. A well with gothic ironwork can also be seen in the centre of the courtyard. The Beaune Altarpiece, by Rogier van der Weyden. The Room of the Poor measures 50x14x16 meters. On the ceiling, the exposed painted frame is in an upside down boat-skiff shape, and in each beam are sculpted caricatures of important inhabitants of Beaune. On the floor tiling are written Nicolas Rolin's monogram and his motto \\"Seulle\\" referring to his wife, Guigone de Salins. The room is furnished with two rows of curtained beds. The central area was set up with benches and tables for meals. The pieces of furniture were brought together in 1875 by the son-in-law of the architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. Each bed could accommodate two patients. Following the large ward is the Chapel, whose location was chosen to allow the bedridden to attend Mass from their beds. The chapel was the original location of the Rogier van der Weyden polyptych altarpiece, now housed in the museum. The remains of Guigone Salins are buried here. In November 2010 the very first Catholic wedding since the construction of the building in 1443 was performed here. The wedding was between Mr Alessandro Conti and Miss Natalie Kunert. In addition to the altarpiece, the hospice possesses many artistic treasures, among them the mural paintings of the 17th century in the Salle St Hugues. Wine auction The charity auction been arranged annually since 1859, taking place on the third Sunday in November amid a three-day festival devoted to the food and wines of Burgundy called Les Trois Glorieuses.winepros.com.au, The Oxford Companion to Wine Hospices de Beaune The charity is preceded by a black tie dinner at the Clos de Vougeot on day one and followed by the lunch La Paul√©e de Meursault on day three.The New York Times: Diner's Journal (November 28, 2006).

With bidding by professional and private buyers, the barrels, from 31 cuv√©es of red wine and 13 of white wine, attain prices usually well in excess of the current commercial values, although the results give some indication of the trend in expected bulk wine prices for the vintage from the rest of the region.Christies.com Hospices de Beaune The auction has been organised by Christie's since 2005, setting a record total figure at the 149th auction in 2009 when 799 barrels were up for sale, and 40% bids by telephone, internet or fax connecting some 500 participants from around the world, the auction has in recent years evolved from a wholesale market to a retail market.Kakaviatos, Panos, Decanter.com (November 16, 2009).Hospices de Beaune nudges 2000 recordSanderson, Bruce, Wine Spectator (November 16, 2009).

Currently, this genus contains six species.  Characterization  Members of the Viunavirus genus share a number of features that are distinguishable from other members of the Myoviridae family. The heads of these phages are icosahedral in nature. Furthermore, their tails are composed of a collared neck (similar in structure to that of a T4 phage), ‚Äúa sheath surrounding a tail tube or core, a thin base plate, and an adsorption structure‚Äù Notably, a series of unique protrusions can be found stemming from the base plate of these organisms. 3 to 4 thick, rounded prongs (located at the bottom of the base plate) and an equal number of thinner, star-like protrusions (attached to the sides of the baseplate via a stalk) have been observed in members of the genus. No other phages that were observed showed similar symmetrical structures. Members of the genus are also similar in terms of genomics. All species in the genus showed above a 75% commonality in protein composition. While ‚Äúthe gene order is strongly conserved in all seven phages‚Ä¶various functional regions are randomly distributed throughout the genome‚Ä¶‚Äù. Functional clustering, as observed in other genera of phages, is uniquely absent from Viunavirus, and proves to be a defining quality of the genus. Due to the diversity in tail-spike filaments, researchers have suggested that these phages may be capable of infecting a wider range of hosts. One such example has already been observed: the species SFP10 has successfully infected of the Genus Salmonella and of the species E. coli. While all members of the genus possess tail spikes, it is important to note that each species may possess unique spikes, many of which must be further researched to determine their function.  Case Study  In 2013, a study conducted by the University of Pittsburgh dealt with the analysis of the Salmonella phage Det7, a potentially new member of the Viunavirus genus (similar to Salmonella P22, of the family Podoviridae). Det7 shares 60 to 90 percent of its nucleotide synthesis with other members of the genus. Testing revealed that the Det7 strain was capable of infecting all hosts affected by Salmonella P22 and 9NA, along with a number of unique host targets.

Oil from the seeds is used as a scent. Leaves are used as thatch in Fiji. In the Philippines, where the tree is known as tabon-tabon, juice from the grated flesh of the fruits is used to neutralize the fishy taste and the acidity of the raw seafood dish kinilaw.

Originally released in 2012, it is an open-source framework licensed under the terms of the BSD License. Unlike most PHP frameworks, Phalcon is implemented as a web server extension written in Zephir and C, aiming to boost execution speed, reduce resource usage, and handle more HTTP requests per second than comparable frameworks written primarily in PHP. One drawback of this approach is that root/administrative access is required on the server to install Phalcon by building a custom binary or using a precompiled one.  History  Phalcon was created by Andr√©s Guti√©rrez and collaborators looking for a new approach to traditional web application frameworks written in PHP. The original draft of the framework in 2011 was called \\"Spark\\", the name was later changed to Phalcon, representing the words \\"PHP\\" and \\"falcon\\". Phalcon's initial release was made available on November 14, 2012. Phalcon 0.3.5 includes an ORM written in C, MVC components, and cache components. This release was followed by the Phalcon 0.5.0 that brought a high-level dialect of SQL called PHQL, and Phalcon 0.6.0 that introduced Volt, a template engine similar to Jinja. Phalcon 1.0 was released on March 22, 2013. with Phalcon 1.3 being the last minor release in that series. Phalcon 2.0 saw most of the project ported from C to Zephir. Phalcon 3.0.0 was released on 29 July 2016, this major release includes support for PHP 7 as well as being Phalcon's first LTS (Long Term Support) release. Phalcon also adopted SemVer for their next releases versioning. Phalcon 4.0.0 was released on 21 December 2019, this major release includes support for PHP 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 has Stricter Interfaces and support PSR-3, PSR-7, PSR-11 (proxy), PSR-13, PSR-16, PSR-17. On 19 August 2020, it was announced that Serghei, the core contributor on the Zephir language was stepping down from the project, thus leaving the language in an unmaintained state. The Phalcon Team decided to abandoned the language and port the framework over to a native PHP application for Version 5. Version 5 will be the first version of Phalcon to support PHP 8. A Phalcon Hangout on 6 September 2020 announced that work has started on Phalcon 5. With this announcement, the projects new repositories were officially made public.

The Geological landforms are typical coastal wetland, including tidal flats, seasonal stream and part of artificial wetland together with a lot of forest land, salt marsh, and bare land. The city of Dafeng belongs to subtropical and warm temperate zone, where thermophilic crops can grow well and influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The average annual temperature is 14.5 ¬∞C and the normal precipitation is over 750 mm per year. Milu‚Äôs Extinction in China Milu is also known as P√®re David's deer or elaphure, a species of deer that is currently extinct in the wild. They are native to the subtropics of China, preferring marshland environment and grazing mainly on grass and aquatic plants. Early in neolithic times, the milu‚Äôs range extended across the majority of mainland China. Archaeologists have found milu antlers at settlements from the Liao River in the north to Jiangsu (including Dafeng) and Zhejiang Province and across the Yellow and Yangtze River Basins in Shaanxi and Hunan Province. However, in the late 19th century, there was only one herd belonged to Tongzhi, the Emperor of China and maintained in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden. Then in 1900, the garden was occupied by German troops and some of the deer were shot and eaten by the German soldiers, some were illegally transported to Europe for exhibition and breeding. Characteristics of Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve is a second reintroduction of Milu into China in 1986 where 36 milu were chosen from five UK zoological gardens with the bulk of the deer coming from Whipsnade Wild Animal Park sponsored by National Forestry Department of China and World Wildlife Fund. It is an unpolluted wetland and has been recognized as a fabulous conservation land for Milu. In 2006, the population at this Nature Reserve had researched around 950 with an average annual population increases 17%. It is now the largest Milu Nature Reserve in the world, and in 1997 it was awarded as the National Nature Reserve in China.http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=bpyTaXggnKcuugmo3y6YGWDASfjINSIKNi5MH-8vdvSXDwffcSeFZmWtYdpjbRIM#4_2 The reserve has been designated as a Ramsar site since 2002. The Reserves have 14 species of animals, 182 species of birds, 27 reptiles and amphibian species, and more than 299 kinds of insects relying on the immense coastline and wetland, which is the paradise of the wildlife. The ecosystem of forest, grassland, water, deer and bird is being created in the Reserve and these species are living in a harmonious biological cycle. Milu have been listed as extinct in the wild, as all populations are under captive management. In Dafeng Nature Reserve, free-ranging projects have been put forward since 1986, after 10 years‚Äô exploring, the free-ranging population has increased 13.2% by year and formed the herd of 118 free-ranging milu. Until 2013.9, the population has increased to 2027 in the Reserve. Tourism Destination Since it was opened to the public as the tourism attraction, until now more than 1 million tourists have visited the Reserve and were educated for wildlife conservation and the importance of environmental protection. There are some tourism measures that meet the sustainable development: * Fengshen Tower (water tower) The water tower was constructed to memorize 39 milu coming back in 1986, which has the main function to storage water in order to resolve the water shortage problem in the Reserve. Tourist can also step onto the top of the tower to overview the Reserve. * Deer viewing Platform The Platform was the imitation of that in Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden, which can facilitate the tourists to enjoy the sight of peaceful deer from a distance. * The Tomb for 39 returning Milu In order to memorize those 39 milu, the tomb was constructed for telling the history for tourists and informing the complexity of the range of deer become larger. * Tourists Route In order to protect Milu and other species, tourist can travel in the outer circle by golf car and observe them from a distance.

Life John Stratford, son of Edward Stratford of Winchcombe and his first wife Dorothy was baptised in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in 1572. He became a London salter apprenticed to Peter Robinson, marrying his daughter Joan at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire on 20 April 1602. They had two sons and five daughters, all born between 1603 and 1615 and baptized at St Matthew's Church, Friday Street, London. He had previously been thought to be a son of John Stratford and Margaret Tracy. Work Stratford traded first in Cheshire cheese and woollen hose from the country, but then switched to rough flax, linen yarn, wheat, and rye, bought from Baltic merchants in exchange for English broadcloth. He entered into partnership with John Hopkins, a fellow apprentice, who also married one of Robinson's daughters. When, through a second marriage, Hopkins became a kinsman of one Vickares, a woollen draper, Hopkins took over the broadcloth trade and Stratford concentrated on the flax trade, in partnership with three others, his half-brother Ralph, Thomas Lane, married to a third daughter of Robinson, and Humphrey Thornbury. They prospered and employed many poor in and near London to dress flax, until the Dutch brought in dressed flax and business diminished. Stratford returned to his Prescott estate in Gloucestershire and began to grow tobacco, raising some capital from Abraham Burrell, but Henry Somerscales as his main partner (Somerscales had learned in the Netherlands how to cultivate tobacco, and took responsibility for the sale of the matured crop). At the same time Stratford was engaged with his half-brother Ralph in soap-boiling in London, and dealt in tallow, potash, soap-ash, and oil. An appeal to the privy council in 1623 prompted their recommendation that his creditors forbear, for one year, later extended, to press for payment. He paid off some debts in sheep, and by growing flax at Winchcombe and Cockbury on 40 acres, employing 800 poor. He also experimented with linen manufacture. He urged the growing of flax and hemp as a state policy, and more ploughing of pasture to make work. Death The date and place of his death are unknown; a lawsuit implies that Stratford was still living in 1634, but he predeceased his wife, whose will was proved on 1 May 1654. The administration of the estate of a John Stratford of Monmouth was granted to his wife Joan in 1638. Sources Joan Thirsk, ‚ÄòStratford, John (b. 1582?, d. in or after 1634)‚Äô, rev.

For comparison, the human genome has 3.2 billion nucleotides. The second smallest genome, from bacteria Tremblaya princeps, has 139,000 nucleotides. While N. deltocephalinicola has the smallest number of nucleotides, it has more protein-coding genes (137) than some bacteria.  Symbiotic relationship  N. deltocephalinicola was discovered when leafhoppers and other phloem- and xylem-feeding insects were investigated for endosymbiotic bacteria. The phloem and xylem of plants are rich in carbohydrates (in the form of sucrose) but lack lipids and proteins. Lipids can be synthesized from carbohydrates; however, proteins require nitrogen, which is not commonly found in plant sap. N. deltocephalinicola along with other bacterial endosymbionts help the insects by synthesizing 10 essential amino acids that they would not otherwise have. The only insects that can benefit from this relationship are those from the suborder Sternorrhyncha, which feed off phloem, and those from the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, which feed off xylem. N. deltocephalinicola can synthesize two of the essential amino acids that these insects require. N. deltocephalinicola uses the UGA codon in its DNA to specify tryptophan instead of the stop as in most other organisms. The symbiotic relationship between N. deltocephalinicola and leafhoppers is proposed to have started at least 200 million years ago, when leafhoppers and spittlebugs diverged evolutionarily. This claim is supported by the fact that N. deltocephalinicola's closest bacterial relative is Zinderia insecticola, which plays the same role for spittlebugs as N. deltocephalinicola does in leafhoppers. Leafhoppers return the favor by providing shelter in the form of a specialized organ in their abdominal cavity called a bacteriome, which they have on both sides of their abdomens. Many types of bacteria can reside in these organs, though the bacteria are completely separated from each other and reside in different sections of the bacteriome. N. deltocephalinicola is an obligate endosymbiont‚Äîit cannot thrive without being in a leafhopper. One reason for this is that N. deltocephalinicola no longer uses the genes needed to synthesize ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. It is proposed that this is because of the high sucrose concentration found in xylem and phloem of plants.

While partying at night, Trevor meets the natives Carmen (Laura Penuela) and Julio (Juanxo Villaverd). Scott becomes interested in exploring the Darien Gap, despite a number of people believing that a group of teenagers were murdered by El Chupacabra in the area, including Julio who warns the group away from going. However, Carmen tells the group of a beautiful waterfall deep in the jungle and convinces them to hike there. The following morning, Julio realizes that Carmen has taken the group into the jungle despite his warnings, and sets off to find them. Meanwhile, the group hike far into the jungle to reach the waterfall. After some time, Trevor and Carmen leave the rest of the group to be alone, but begin to hear strange noises in the jungle. While Trevor is investigating, Carmen disappears. They attempt phoning her, but find her phone smashed nearby, before losing service, leaving them stranded in the jungle. As night falls, the group realize that they are being stalked. After catching a glimpse of a wild animal, the group scatter through the jungle in terror, and Charlie is attacked and killed. Elena and Trevor discover the body and run into Scott and Steph. Scott decides to try and reach higher ground in order to get cell-phone service. After leaving the others, Scott records a distress video, hoping it will reach someone who can help. However, he is interrupted by the others screaming and rushes back, only to find a bloodied Trevor, who is quickly dragged away. Scott follows him into a cave where he finds El Chupacabra's lair, then flees and catches up with Steph and Elena. Trevor awakens in the cave with a broken leg and finds Carmen's mauled body. He attempts to escape from the cave, but is attacked and killed. The following day, Scott's video has been posted on social media and has gone viral, prompting a search and rescue mission by Panama authorities, accompanied by Julio. Having survived the night, Scott, Steph and Elena are once again attacked by El Chupacabra. While running through the jungle, Steph breaks her ankle. Scott stays with Steph while Elena leaves to flag down the attention of an overhead helicopter. However, as the helicopter crew is recording Elena she is attacked by El Chupacabra. Soon afterwards, Scott and Steph are also attacked, but military personnel arrive and shoot El Chupacabra, saving them.

The film features Deborah Tranelli as its protagonist, actress- turned-vigilante Carla Harris. The film has since received a cult following and is often mentioned in works discussing films of the rape and revenge genre. Plot Carla Harris is living the American dream. She has a handsome and wealthy husband, Mark. On their way home from a restaurant, they spot a man attacking a woman. Mark tries to help but is killed. The man escapes when the police arrive. Russo, an officer, goes to her house and tells her that there are no witnesses. Russo says that he will contact her if they find anything. On the way to her parents' house, Carla stops at a gas station where she sees her old boyfriend Burke and one of Burke's friends, Sparky. Later that night, Carla goes to a club and meets her old high school friends, her best friend Estelle and her husband Slob. Carla also meets David but Estelle doesn't like him. After being accosted by Fletch, the local butcher, Carla goes home. While she is changing, she notices Timmy, the gardener spying on her. Later that night, the men break into her house and rape her. When her parents return, Burke grabs Mr. Harris's shotgun and kills them, as well as Timmy. Meanwhile, in the hospital, Carla wakes up and tells the doctor that she wants revenge. Later that night, she escapes from the hospital. She goes to the closed bar, seduces the bartender and convinces him to pour wine all over his body. She steals his gun, then throws a candle at him, leaving him to burn. The next day, Carla finds Burke in his speedboat. She grabs a knife on the boat and stabs him. She then takes a grapple and throws it through his chest. She ties the other end to his boat and starts the boat, making him drown and then escapes. Carla then sneaks to Sparky's gas station. While Sparky is working on a car, Carla drops the car on him, killing him. Later that night, Carla goes to Arnie's ice company. Carla pushes Arnie in the ice cube maker. A block of ice pushes him in the cube hole, leaving him to die. Carla goes to the ice truck when Fletch, the gang and some town locals spot her and chase her to her parents' house. Carla blocks the doors and hides in a corner. The men start to burn the house down, but Carla goes into the basement and escapes through a vent. When the Sheriff asks Fletch about the burning, he claims he knew nothing about it. Later that night, Fletch is alone in the butcher shop. Carla arrives and the two fight. Carla finds the shotgun that Fletch used to kill her family and kills him with it. Two months later, in New York, Carla finds the man who killed her husband. She seduces him, then grabs his gun and shoots him. She then walks away in tears.

Mahlberg as George Butch * Bill Kip as Deputy Reilly Production The film, a Westbook Brooks production in association with D.S., was directed by Cirio H. Santiago and was shot in New York City and Connecticut. The screenplay was written by Reilly Askew and Anthony Maharaj. While the film has been frequently thought of as an unofficial remake of Meir Zarchi's I Spit On Your Grave (1978) since both movies share a similar storyline, this claim has neither been refuted nor acknowledged. Deborah Tranelli, best known for her longtime role in the soap opera Dallas, was cast as the lead character and protagonist, actress-turned-vigilante Carla Harris. Not having a stunt double, Tranelli did her own action exploits. The theme song was performed by her as well. Kaz Garas, Rosemarie Gil, Ed Crick, Nick Nicholson and Terrence O'Hara also star in the film, while Carmen Argenziano has a cameo appearance as a detective. Reception In his short review for the Sydney Morning Herald, David Frith described the character Harris as \\"a sort of female Charles Bronson, wreaking bloody revenge on male hoodlums.\\" In analysing the film in his work Screening the Male: Exploring Masculinities in the Hollywood Cinema, Steve Cohan compares it with I Spit On Your Grave and postulates that the film's castration scene is a partial representation of \\"a male death wish\\". He adds that \\"there is no doubt that the audience is intended to enjoy his save punishment\\". A similar conclusion is made in Introduction to Film Studies, in which author Jill Nelmes argues that Species samples elements from Naked Vengeance and I Spit On Your Grave, whereas Annette Kuhn likens it to Violated (1984) and Shame (1987). The magazine Critical Condition (which focuses on \\"obscure & bizarre films on video and DVD\\") described Naked Vengeance as \\" a perfectly crazy rip-off of I Spit on Your Grave (1978), maybe even outdoing it in sheer sleaze factor alone,\\" and judges it to be Santiago's \\"crowning achievement\\". The website AllMovie notes that the film \\"obviously takes its inspiration from I Spit On Your Grave\\", but added that the film \\"is likely to amuse exploitation fans\\" due to it going to lengths to be more outrageous than its predecessor and becoming a self-parody by being overt in presentation of the heroine enduring a brutal rape and then having to witness her own parents being killed in front of her resulting in her seeking revenge. The reviewer cautioned viewers and concluded, \\"The end result is as subtle as a flying mallet and ragged in both the acting and technical departments but Deborah Tranelli delivers a brave, surprisingly strong performance as the beleaguered heroine and the film uses that performance to its benefit by having her in the majority of its scenes. To sum up, Naked Vengeance might be derivative schlock but it has a certain crude effectiveness that will appeal to grindhouse fans. Using a methodology that polls viewers to measure their \\"satisfaction\\" with the picture, HBO's Guide to Movies on Videocassette and Cable TV gave this film a four-star rating.

He founded the Hybrid Network, a cluster of social businesses that pioneered the \\"hybrid value chain\\" concept. Before he became a social entrepreneur, he had a long career in business, as a consultant for McKinsey & Company and CEO of Ayala Land, a publicly listed company. Ayala was recognized by Ernst & Young as the 2012 Entrepreneur of the Year and the 2012 Social Entrepreneur of the Year for the Philippines. In 2013, he was named as one of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship's 24 World Social Entrepreneurs of the Year.  Early life and education  Ayala was born in the Philippines as the second out of five children. His mother, a member of the Imperial clan in Naga, had a master's degree in English. His father grew up in Manila and worked in government, as the chairman of the BOI. Ayala's father died when Jim was 14. His late father's final bidding, to get a good education, take care of their mother, and return to the Philippines to help in its development, has been important motivation in Ayala's family life and career.http://alumni.princeton.edu/volunteer/committees/ctnat/trustee/PUAABios2012.pdf Ayala attended Ateneo de Manila University before continuing his education in the United States. Ayala graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University in 1984, earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. In 1988, he graduated with honors from Harvard Business School, where he received his master's degree in Business Administration.  Corporate career  = McKinsey & Company = Ayala was a Director (Global Senior Partner) for McKinsey & Company, the world's leading top-management consulting firm. During his 19-year career at McKinsey, Ayala worked in 29 countries, focusing on development work in emerging markets. He helped open nine offices in China and Southeast Asia and was the head of the firm's Asian Energy Practice.

After working in the corporate world for several decades he began to question why he was not spending his energy helping people who need the most help. Ayala realized that most businesses neglect the poorest one-third of humanity. He was quoted in Business World Magazine as saying, \\"We have to work with the citizens of this country to empower them; they need access to basic things. They need access to food, electricity, health care, clean water.\\" In an effort to empower poor, remote communities throughout the Philippines, Ayala left the corporate world in 2010 to found the Hybrid Network, a cluster of social businesses focused on working together to engage market and philanthropic forces in \\"hybrid value chains.\\" = Hybrid Social Solutions, Inc. = In June 2010, Ayala founded the award-winning social enterprise, Hybrid Social Solutions (HSSi). HSSi seeks to provide Filipinos in need with access to high- quality and affordable products and training services necessary for development. HSSi primarily distributes a large selection of durable, warranty-protected solar-powered lights with cell phone charging capabilities, in order to provide a source of light and communication to off-grid communities. HSSi partners with socially-oriented organizations on the ground in rural areas in order to distribute their products to rural communities, schools, and health units in the Philippines. HSSi is able to provide financing for buyers in need by partnering with microfinance institutions and cooperatives. According to a Planete d'Entrepreneur Social Impact Assessment, 97% of HSSi's customers said it was not difficult to pay back their loan every week. Kerosene consumption decreased by over 81% among HSSi's users, contributing to an average savings of over PhP 4,000 per customer per year. Additional working hours at night, provided by the solar light systems, contributed an additional PhP 17,000 in earnings per years on average. The report also notes significant increases in studying time, motivation, air quality, safety, and time savings after purchasing the HSSi solar light systems.http://www.planetedentrepreneurs.com/planete/?p=2679‚ü®=en After only two years at HSSi, Ayala received both the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award and the Ernst & Young Social Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Philippines in 2012. Ayala currently serves as the CEO of HSSi. = Stiftung Solarenergie Philippines = Ayala also founded Stiftung Solarenergie Philippines (StS), a Filipino foundation that is a founding member of Stiftung Solarenergie International Network for Rural Development, an international non-profit organization whose mission is to work for rural development and poverty alleviation by providing solar energy in rural and marginalized areas worldwide. As a part of their Light for Education and Light for Health programs, StS Philippines donates solar lights with charging capabilities to local schools and health clinics, rather than individual households. StS provides in-depth trainings and requires that the school or clinic complete weekly monitoring forms. In some cases, StS donates an original set of lights to an off-grid community and works with them to create a rental program, which allows the community to generate enough capital to purchase more lights and continue having access sustainably. Ayala currently serves as the Chairman of Stiftung Solarenergie Philippines. = Hystra, Inc. = Ayala is also a network partner of Hystra, a global consulting firm that works alongside social entrepreneurs and large corporations.

He was the eight Prime Minister of Slovenia, leading the 12th Government. He served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 13th Government. He is a full professor at the Chair of Theory and Sociology of Law at the University of Ljubljana Faculty of Law. Cerar was born on 25 August 1963. After graduating in law, he was employed by the Ljubljana Faculty of Law. In the late 1980s, he actively participated in the efforts for the democratisation and state independence of Slovenia. In 1990 and 1991, he participated in drafting the Basic Constitutional Charter on the Sovereignty and Independence of the Republic of Slovenia and the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. Between 1992 and 2014, he was a lecturer at the Faculty of Law of Ljubljana University, and an external adviser to the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia for constitutional and other legal matters. In 2008, as a Fulbright Fellow, he lectured on comparative constitutional law at the Golden Gate University School of Law in San Francisco and pursued post-doctoral studies at the University of California School of Law at Berkeley. Before entering politics in 2014, he was known as a jurist and intellectual specialising in the interpretation of constitutionality and the legality of the operation of state authorities. He advocated the rule of law, constitutional democracy, improved legal culture and higher ethical standards in the society. In the 2000‚Äì2018 period, in the annual polls conducted by the Ius Software portal (iusinfo.si), he ranked among ten most influential Slovenian lawyers 17 times, and in the 2011‚Äì2014 period, users of the Tax Fin-Lex portal voted him the most influential Slovenian legal expert four times. In 2014, he entered politics, established the Miro Cerar Party (SMC) and was elected prime minister after his party won the parliamentary elections. After a number of crisis years, his coalition government (2014‚Äì2018) managed to stabilise the political situation and lead the country out of the financial-economic crisis. The government consolidated public finances, adopted a state asset management strategy and gradually abandoned the austerity measures. The government encouraged rapid economic recovery and stable economic growth, and started allocating more resources to all social areas. These and some other measures made it possible for Slovenia to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances, which had persisted after 2011. In 2015 and 2016, in cooperation with local communities and NGOs, Cerar‚Äôs government managed to secure the humane and safe treatment and transit of approximately half a million migrants across the Slovenian territory. In the 2018‚Äì2020 period, Cerar was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Slovenia. By ensuring balanced foreign policy and good neighbourly relations, he intensified cooperation with the EU core countries, with pronounced relations with Benelux, and the United States. He advocated Slovenia‚Äôs greater opening up into the world. Among his priorities were economic diplomacy, sustainable development, rule of law, human rights, humanitarian action, and multilateralism. He was among the most ardent European promoters of the EU enlargement to the Western Balkans. Early life and education Miro Cerar was born on 25 August 1963 in Ljubljana. He is the father of three children. He grew up with his sisters in Ljubljana and Grosuplje. His father Miroslav Cerar (born in 1939) is a multiple European, world, and Olympic pommel horse champion (he also won medals in other gymnastic disciplines), and after the end of his sports career, he worked as a lawyer until his retirement. He is a founding member and active official of the Olympic Committee of Slovenia. Cerar‚Äôs mother Zdenka Cerar (n√©e Prusnik, 1941‚Äì2013) was a national gymnastics champion in her youth, and later, when she worked as a lawyer, she served as State Prosecutor General and Minister of Justice. Cerar started attending the Prule Primary School in 1970 and enrolled in the Ivan Cankar Grammar School in Ljubljana in 1978. From 1982 to 1983, he did his compulsory military service in today‚Äôs Podgorica (formerly Titograd, Montenegro), and started studying law in 1983. In 1983, Cerar enrolled in the Faculty of Law in Ljubljana, and graduated in 1987. In 1987, he received the Slavko Zore Prize awarded by the United Nations Association of Slovenia for his bachelor's thesis Legal Protection of Trademarks (advisor: Kre≈°imir Puhariƒç). Upon graduation, he was employed as a teaching assistant at the Theory of Law Department at the Faculty of Law in Ljubljana. Academic career In the late 1980s, Cerar published a number of research articles and popular science articles, and started asserting himself as a critical legal thinker in the Slovenian public. In 1988, he was one of the authors of the book Pravni memorandum: Voja≈°ki to≈æilec versus Bor≈°tner, Jan≈°a, Tasiƒá, Zavrl (Legal Memorandum: Military Prosecutor vs. Bor≈°tner, Jan≈°a, Tasiƒç, Zavrl), and in 1989 he participated in writing Pravni memorandum: Svoboda zdru≈æevanja (Legal Memorandum: Freedom of Association). Both books called for the enforcement of the rule of law and democratic values, particularly in the light of the then non-democratic pressures of the regime on the democratisation process in Slovenia. Between 1993 and 1999, he was a correspondent of the Center for the Study of Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe (based at the New York University School of Law, and previously at the University of Chicago Law School and Central European University in Budapest), and he contributed periodic reports on the development of constitutionalism in Slovenia to the East European Constitutional Review. In 1993, he obtained his master‚Äôs degree from the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Law with the thesis The Multidimensional Nature of Human Rights and Duties, and in 1999 his doctoral degree from the same faculty with the dissertation (Ir)rationality of Modern Law. In 2000, he was appointed an assistant professor at the Faculty of Law; in 2005, he became an associate professor, and in 2011, he became a full professor . His areas of expertise included the theory and philosophy of law, comparative law, constitutional law, and the ethics of legal professions. He also lectured on the basics of law at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Ljubljana (2006‚Äì2014), and on the theory of law and state at the University of Maribor's Faculty of Law (1995‚Äì1998). From 2002 to 2014, he annually delivered a set of lectures on basic legal concepts for translation students (specialising in German). In the 2011‚Äì2012 academic year, the University of Ljubljana's Student Council voted him the best teacher at the Faculty of Law. From 1989 to 2004, he was a mentor in the Legal Aid Service for Students, established by the University of Ljubljana's Student Organisation, where students from the Ljubljana Faculty of Law provided free legal assistance in study-related matters to other students. From 1994 to 2003, he was an external evaluator for the leaving exam subject in law. Between 1994 and 2014, he lectured on constitutional topics as part of the specialised training programme for state administration employees. From 2009 to 2012 he was chair of the examination committee for the state bar exam, and an examiner in constitutional arrangement, organisation of the justice system, and state administration, as well as the foundations of the EU legal order. From 2003 to 2014, he was vice president of the Slovenian Association for Legal and Social Philosophy. For six months in 2008, as a Fulbright Fellow, he taught comparative constitutional law at the Golden Gate University School of Law in San Francisco and pursued post-doctoral studies at the University of California School of Law at Berkeley . From 1990 to 1992, he was a member of the editorial board of ƒåasopis za kritiko znanosti (Journal for the Critique of Science). From 1995 to 2014, he was an editor of the research journal Zbornik znanstvenih razprav at the Faculty of Law at the University of Ljubljana. From 2003 to 2014, he was a member of the editorial board of the Manet research series of the Ljubljana Faculty of Law, and from 2003 to 2006 a member of the editorial board of the magazine Revus (covering European constitutionality) published by GV Revije. From 2002 to 2014, he was a member of the editorial board of the journal Theory and Practice published by the Faculty of Social Sciences in Ljubljana, and of the book series Legal Horizons issued by Cankarjeva Zalo≈æba in Ljubljana. Between 2009 and 2013, he was a member of the Expert Board for Scientific Books and Journals at the Slovenian Book Agency, acting particularly as a reviewer of diverse social science contributions. From 2000 to 2018, in the annual polls conducted by the Ius Software portal (iusinfo.si), he ranked among the ten most influential Slovenian lawyers 17 times, and from 2011 to 2014 users of the Tax-Fin-Lex portal voted him the most influential Slovenian legal expert four times. =Constitutional and advisory roles= In June 1990, Cerar, together with Peter Jambrek, Lojze Ude, and other experts, participated in drafting the initial proposal for launching the procedure for the adoption of a new Slovenian constitution put forth by the Presidency of the Republic of Slovenia. As an expert assistant, he coordinated the work of a 7-member expert group (members: Franc Grad, Tine Hribar, Peter Jambrek, Tone Jerov≈°ek, Matev≈æ Krivic, Anton Pereniƒç, and Lojze Ude), which prepared a working draft of a new Slovenian constitution at Podvin Castle in August 1990 . Between 1991 and 1992, he was Secretary of the Constitutional Commission of the Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia. In the same period, he also participated in drafting the following constitutional and legislative proposals: Amendments 99 and 100 to the then Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia; Basic Constitutional Charter on the Sovereignty and Independence of the Republic of Slovenia and the constitutional act for its implementation (25 June 1991); Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia and the constitutional act for its implementation (23 December 1991); and acts governing the elections into the National Assembly and the National Council, and presidential elections (1992). In the periods 1993‚Äì2007 and 2009‚Äì2014, Cerar served as an external adviser to the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia for constitutional and legal matters, regularly coordinating the work of expert groups drafting opinions and constitutional amendments for the Constitutional Commission of the National Assembly. From the adoption of the Constitution (1991) to the moment he entered politics (2014), he participated in all discussions on constitutional amendments. He contributed to opinions on various constitutional and legal matters, particularly related to the electoral and wider political system, referendums, immunity of deputies, and parliamentary rules of procedure. He was a member of expert groups tasked with the preparation of changes to rules of procedure and with the English translation of the Constitution, other constitutional acts, and the Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly. He advised the Legal Service of the National Assembly, Secretariat General, Office of the President of the National Assembly, and Constitutional Commission. After having served as deputy president since 2009, Cerar acted as president of the Judicial Council between 2010 and 2012 . In this capacity, he participated in the procedures for the election, appointment, and discharge of judges and presidents of the courts, and those related to the promotion of judges, the immunity of judges and the incompatibility of the functions, disciplinary procedures against judges, and other procedures falling under the competence of the Judicial Council. He participated in several expert meetings with high representatives of judicial councils of European countries. As Slovenian representative to the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ), Cerar participated in the ENCJ project group tasked with establishing the level of public trust in the judiciary at the national and supranational levels in the 2010‚Äì2011 period, and in the 2011‚Äì2012 period in the ENCJ working group on judicial reform in Europe. Political career On 13 February 2013, Cerar refused the offer by the then majority parliamentary coalition to assume the office of Prime Minister, claiming that the parliamentary parties did not provide the necessary foundations for successfully overcoming the social crisis (later, the coalition parties elected Alenka Bratu≈°ek as Prime Minister) . In the months that followed, Cerar brought together a group of like-minded individuals with whom on 2 June 2014 he formed a central social-liberal party called the Miro Cerar Party (SMC), just six weeks before an early parliamentary election. The party manifesto focused on different measures to overcome the crisis underlining human dignity, the rule of law, improved political culture and sustainable development. Cerar was elected deputy and his party took 34.5% of the vote (36 seats, the biggest number of deputies of a single party so far) thus claiming electoral victory. On 25 August, the National Assembly elected Cerar as Prime Minister . He formed a centre-left coalition and began his term on 17 September. On 21 November 2014, SMC joined the ALDE European political group (the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe), and in March 2015 the party was renamed the Party of the Modern Centre (SMC) on the initiative of Cerar. =Prime minister of Slovenia (2014‚Äì2018)= The 12th Slovenian Government was formed with a coalition of three parties: SMC (9 ministers, some of whom were not members of the party), the Social Democrats ‚Äì SD (3 ministers) and the Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia ‚Äì Desus (4 ministers); this was the first Slovenian Government comprising an equal number of female and male ministers throughout its term of office. After several years of turmoil, this Government managed to stabilise the political situation leading the country out of the financial and economic crisis. The Government consolidated the public finances and gradually loosened the austerity measures. The country experienced a rapid economic recovery with a stable and relatively high economic growth and a considerable drop in unemployment, particularly among the young population. The Government gradually increased the funds for all areas of social life. These and other measures and institutional changes helped Slovenia correct the macroeconomic imbalances, recorded since 2011, for which it was publicly also commended by the European Commission. During the last year in office (2018), the Government managed to secure a balanced budget with a surplus, while the sovereign debt started its downward trend and unemployment hit a record low for the first time since 2009. To tackle the economic crisis, Cerar‚Äôs government revived and strengthened national and foreign investment, including in public infrastructure with the upgrade and modernisation of rail and road connections. The Government also secured the fulfilment of key administrative and financial conditions to begin the construction of the second track of the Divaƒça‚ÄìKoper railway line. In addition, it provided incentives for start-ups and the digitalisation of public administration in cooperation with the private sector. In its efforts to overcome the crisis, the Government tried to ensure balanced regional development, including through regular government visits across the regions. In the 2015‚Äì2016 period, the Government joined forces with the local authorities and NGOs to enable the humane and safe treatment and passage of some 500,000 migrants across the Slovenian territory. During the largest migrant wave in modern times, Cerar launched a special initiative to spur cooperation between EU Member States and the Western Balkan states, which eventually lead to the closure of the so-called Balkan migrant route. On 14 March 2018, Cerar resigned as Prime Minister following a Supreme Court decision to overturn the results of the referendum on the second railway track which garnered 53% of support; according to him, this was \\"the last straw\\" as it provided unjustified support to all those wishing to halt the project. At the same time, his resignation averted the possible consequences of considerable financial claims by certain trade unions that would hinder the successful consolidation of public finances (due to Cerar‚Äôs resignation the negotiations between the Government and public sector trade unions automatically stopped). The resignation was announced only a few months prior to the deadline for calling and organising the regular parliamentary election. The early election was held on 3 June 2018, i.e. already within the time frame of the envisaged regular 2018 election. After his resignation, Cerar continued to serve as caretaker Prime Minister until the new government was approved on 14 September 2018. =2018 parliamentary election= At the June 2018 early election, Cerar was re-elected deputy and his party obtained 9.7% of the vote thus losing its leading position among centrist voters . Despite considerably lower results compared to the previous election, SMC got ten deputies in a 90-seat Parliament and preserved an important role in the Slovenian political arena (sharing the third position in terms of the number of deputies). This was also one of the reasons why the party was crucial in forming the new coalition government, where it took over four ministries. In the centre-left Government, formed by Marjan ≈†arec in September 2018, Cerar was appointed deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs; he discharged these duties until the Government resigned in March 2020 . =Deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs (2018‚Äì2020)= Upon assuming these duties, Cerar announced and started implementing a partial change in foreign policy, which was to remain balanced in general but, in parallel, turn slightly more towards the West, favouring closer cooperation with the core countries of the European Union, with pronounced relations with Benelux, and the United States. He sped up the preparations for the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU and contributed to strengthening Slovenia‚Äôs credibility within the Union . He strengthened the bilateral ties between Slovenia and members of the UN Security Council, as well as other countries which are particularly important to Slovenia for political, economic, and other reasons. He dedicated special attention to the strategic cooperation with Germany and France, as well as the relations with the United Kingdom in the post-Brexit period. He prioritised strengthening economic diplomacy along with efforts for sustainable development, the rule of law, human rights and non-discrimination, multilateralism and humanitarian aid. He also devoted attention to cooperation with neighbouring countries, particularly in the light of protecting the rights and interests of Slovenians living in these countries. At the European level, Cerar was among the most vocal supporters of the enlargement process to the Western Balkan countries, and closer Euro-Atlantic cooperation (accession of North Macedonia to NATO). In the May 2019 European Parliament election, SMC only got 1.6% of the votes . Cerar did not run for MEP and soon after this weak result, he announced an electoral congress of the party to be held on 21 September 2019 where he would not run for president. At the congress, Cerar endorsed Zdravko Poƒçival≈°ek as president of the party and was subsequently appointed honorary president by members of the congress On 2 March 2020, Cerar decided to renounce his title of honorary president and leave the SMC party due to disagreements with the party‚Äôs position and activities under Poƒçival≈°ek .

The Santri group of students said that Bangil derived from Mbah Ngilmu, referring to a cleric who was known to be courageous in the defense of Islam. The more popular story in the wider community says that the name comes from the Javanese word Mbah'e Angel, where the word angel Means very difficult, referring to the character of the Bangil people that is difficult to change. The name of Bangil is also listed in an ancient Chinese documents stating that when King Ta'Cheh (either Muawiyah bin Abu Sufyan or his son Yazid I) sent a spy to monitor the Kalinga Kingdom, the messenger landed at a small harbor named Banger, or Bang-il as the Chinese call it.

Suropati's force tried to defend the fortification wall surrounding Bangil with its artillery, but eventually the Dutch, led by Govert Knol, defeated him and took over the town, where they lost about 400 to 500 soldiers of the Madurese. Arab merchants arrived around 1860 in the old town for trading, along with the Chinese merchants through a port in Porong Creek, located between Bangil and Rembang. Although Bangil was a relatively small area used as a stopover village, it was already known by traders familiar with its economic potentials, before they spread to the surrounding areas. Since 1873, Hadharim settlements were created in Bangil under the leaderships of several Kapitan Arab such as Saleh bin Muhammad bin Said Sabaja (1892), Muhammad bin Saleh Sabaja (1920), and Muhammad bin Salim Nabhan (1930). Although not often noted in the historical literature, records show that Bangil was once reached by a Hindu kingdom, Medang Kamulan. However, Bangil is more known as a region that has very strong Islamic culture, including the presence of Islamic educational institutions spread throughout the city.

The film starred Fearless Nadia, billed as the \\"Indian Pearl White\\" in the film. Her co-stars were Sardar Mansur, John Cawas billed as \\"Eddie Polo\\", Atish Sayani and Gulab. It was the third in the Diamond Thriller series. Like each film in the series, this too was a success. Nadia plays Savita whose father is the station master framed for a murder committed by a masked man. The masked man is intent on disrupting the railway service of the town to make way for an airline service. The highlights are Nadia's stunts on top of a speeding train fighting a gang of rail-road bandits. Plot The deputy station master (Ishwarlal) at a railway station is murdered by a man in a mask. In the scuffle, his mask comes off and one of his hench-men sees his face. They escape from there just before the station master Maganlal (Master Mohammed) arrives who handles the knife which has been used to kill the deputy. The police appear and arrest him for the murder. His daughter Savita (Nadia) and son Jayant (Jaidev) get the news by a wire sent by their uncle, Shyamlal (Sayani Atish). Nadia, a.k.a. Frontier Mail is fond of hunting, playing tennis and racing fast cars, while Jayant is an amateur film maker. Soon Jayant and his friend (Munchi Thoothi) get involved in the villain's antics as they manage to film him and his gang readying to blow up a bridge. The masked man dynamites the bridge as he's been contracted to do so by a man who wants to promote his airline business. There is also a gangster's moll Gulab (Gulshan), who is romantically linked first with Shyamlal and then with Kishore (John Cawas). Gulab later reforms and sides with Nadia and her brother in hunting down the masked man. Sunder (Sardar Mansur), is the son of the head of the railways authority. He becomes infatuated with Savita and rushes to help her. They are involved in several chases culminating in a fight scene on top of a speeding train, where Savita fist-fights the gang alongside Sundar. She lifts some of the men and hurles them down on the tracks. It's finally revealed that the masked man who calls himself Signal X is none other than Savita's uncle Shyamlal.

JBH Wadia had to face the wrath of the B.B. and C.I Railway as the posters of the film showed a crashing train. Later after a country-wide poll it was decided to call the film Miss Frontier Mail. The film experimented with technology in the form of car chases, dynamites, the intercom system and the film camera. This allowed the film its modernistic treatment along western lines with car chases, planes and trains. The film had the ubiquitous horse, Punjab Ka Beta (Son of Punjab), and the Austin credited as \\"Rolls Royce Ki Beti\\" (daughter of Rolls Royce). Accidents while filming were kept in the final cut. Reception According to The Bombay Chronicle 29 July 1936 it was running to full houses even in its tenth week. It also called it the Wadia brothers \\"Speediest Diamond Thriller\\".

Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. Evidence show this treatment can be considered for children as well. When diet and medication has proven ineffective, transanal irrigation is used. Advantages and disadvantages Possible advantages: * Avoids surgery, medications, or other procedures * By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel dysfunction. This enables the users to develop a consistent bowel routine by choosing the time and place of evacuation. * In patients with constipation, regular evacuation of the lower part of colon and rectum can accelerate transit through the entire colon.Colonic emptying after transanal irrigation Bazzocchi G, Poletti E, Pillastrini There has, perhaps unsurprisingly, been a rapid uptake of transanal irrigation methods in highly symptomatic patient groups with anorectal symptoms. * In individuals with fecal incontinence, efficient emptying of the lower part of colon and rectum means that new feces may not reach the rectum for up to 2 days, which may prevent leakage between irrigations. * May decrease the incidence of urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic bowel and bladder problems Possible disadvantages: * Requires training by a healthcare professional so individual understands how to use the equipment * A degree of dexterity is required to perform transanal irrigation at home. If the individual cannot perform the irrigation themselves, a carer may be required * Periodic replacement of the equipment is needed, or microbial biofilms may start grow inside the tubing, contaminating the irrigation fluid. Current TAI devices offer single-use rectal catheters or cones. * Persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid after the irrigation may occur and make this option unhelpful as liquids are more difficult to retain than solids in persons with fecal incontinence. * Complications such as electrolyte imbalance (not demonstrated when using either tap water or saline solution) and perforation (very rare).

The buildings were intended to serve as residential townhouses like those immediately adjacent in Laura Place. However, over several decades shopfronts were added to form an extension to the shopping parade on Pulteney Bridge. As a result the street now has a fine selection of shopfronts with designs from several different architectural periods.

Life Gandar√≠as was a Spanish painter, born in Guernica in the Basque Country. She graduated in Fine Arts from the Facultad de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Universidad Complutense, Madrid. Music had been a powerful influence on her life. In 1978 she painted Kokoscha-Alma Mahler, three characters whose interrelated destinies are representative of their Zeitgeist. This was the beginning of an intense artistic output in series such as \\"La protesta del silencio\\" (1980) or \\"Presencias\\" (1986). ‚ÄúGandarias contemplates her models, living or dead, with a gaze like that of a seer or a somnambulist, in order to give them form ‚Äù from within‚Äù and to release their voices.‚Äú(Roa Bastos) She married Enrique Bar√≥n Crespo in Venice in 1987. Her son Alejandro was born the following year. She resumed her work with a big retrospective exhibition in Venice, the city which is her inspiration, in 1990. Her commitment to world peace and culture was expressed in her exhibition ‚ÄúPour la tolerance‚Äù at the Grande Arche de la Fraternit√©, Paris. This was opened by Federico Mayor Zaragoza, Simone Veil and Barbara Hendricks, whose portrait ‚ÄúLove Prayer‚Äù was the symbol of the show which celebrated the 50th Anniversary of UNESCO. She painted the portrait of the great virtuoso violinist Yehudi Menuhin ‚Äúthe wisest man I have ever met‚Äù and began to cooperate with his Foundation. She devoted the year 2000 to the study of Primo Levi's ‚ÄúSe questo √® un uomo‚Äù (‚ÄúIf this is a man‚Äù) which resulted in the series \\"Primo Levi, la memoria\\". After the attack in New York City she painted the tableau NY 9/11 a series of 13 paintings, from which ‚ÄúMiserere Julianna‚Äù is going on display at the 9/11 Memorial Museum. The series ‚ÄúKafka, the visionary‚Äù a series of 64 paintings was exhibited in the Haus am Kleistpark (Berlin), Ariowitsch Haus(Leipzig) and Czech Center- Instituto Cervantes (Prag).

John Taylor John Taylor (1921‚Äì2003) had been interviewed for the editorship of The Tailor & Cutter in 1945, after being demobilised from the Royal Navy, but did not get the job. After his initial failure, he secured another chance and wore his \\"Fleet Air Arm uniform with gold pilot wings and lieutenant's rings\\" and this time he was successful. This lesson in the importance of clothes and style formed a lasting impression on Taylor. He went on to edit that magazine for 24 years and his weekly comments on the dress of celebrities, politicians and royalty attracted international attention and fame, transforming Tailor & Cutter into what The Times called \\"the most quoted trade magazine in the world\\". Man About Town Man About Town began as a quarterly magazine in 1952 and Taylor's editing was typically irreverent, not least about the magazine itself. It was said that a subscription, at sixteen shillings, showed \\"that a fool and his money are soon parted\\" and included the statement \\"Man About Town is edited by John Taylor, but never mind\\". Magforum said: \\"For [John] Taylor, Man About Town was a platform to indulge his interests in fine wines, especially champagne, good food, women and entertaining company\\"Man About Town magazine: 1950s pioneer of men's sector Magforum, 21 November 2012. Retrieved 2 June 2014. and the magazine once carried the slogan \\"women and various other bad habits\\". Town photographic cover from 1962 The Press Gazette called Man About Town the \\"progenitor of all today's men's style magazines\\". In earlier editions it was personified by a middle aged man with a mustache and mutton chops who appeared on the cover as the main figure, or smaller leaning against the title and on the contents page inside. Later, the appearance and content of the magazine changed significantly as it took its place in the media of 1960s Swinging London. More photographic material was used and art director Tom Wolsey was important in helping photographers like Terence Donovan and Don McCullin become established. Mike Dempsey said of Wolsey's work: \\"The look of the magazine was dynamic in its use of typography, space to breathe and wonderful images.\\"Tom Wolsey: My Kind of Town Mike Dempsey, Royal Designer for Industry, 31 July 2013. Retrieved 2 June 2014. Also featured were cartoons by Michael Heath, Mel Calman and Gerald Scarfe. Takeover by Cornmarket In 1960, the magazine was extracted from its Savile Row roots and used as the launch pad for the Cornmarket (later Haymarket) group when it was bought by Clive Labovitch and Michael Heseltine.\\"Man about Town\\", The Financial Times, 7 January 1960, p. 13. Heseltine had done a property deal to fund the purchase of the magazine. He told The Financial Times that \\"major changes\\" were planned including a larger page size and a new type of binding. The magazine was selling around 30,000 copies per edition at the time. Heseltine later told Campaign: \\"We bought a spin-off consumer magazine from the trade title, Tailor & Cutter. It was called Man About Town and had little to commend itself. A supplement to its parent, it was about the trade and for the trade. Clive [Labovitch] recruited a team that was to turn this tatty quarterly into a glossy monthly for men. In one sense we were ahead of the time. Men's fashion was at the margin of acceptability and men's magazines relied almost entirely upon their willingness to peddle soft porn. We were not in that business. The magazine relied for revenue on the advertising industry, and on the wish of art directors and copywriters to see their work displayed in this pace-setting publication.\\" The title was changed to About Town and, in 1962, just Town. The look of the new magazine was much more modern. The mutton chops were gone, replaced with photographic, rather than painted, covers with bold colour choices. However, as the Press Gazette commented in 2004, it \\"was never the same without John's humour and originality\\". A Town magazine cover from 1967. By this time the covers had become considerably more sexualised. Also in 1962, Cornmarket bought the weekly news magazine Topic, which had only started in 1961,\\"Topic News Magazine To Be Published on Oct. 18\\", The Financial Times, 14 July 1961, p. 18. which it relaunched like Man About Town. The idea was to create a British version of Newsweek. The effort was a failure however, and nearly destroyed the company. Topic was incorporated into Town the same year. Cover art in Town went through a number of different styles characteristic of the era, and continued to feature a variety of topics, but towards the end in 1967 it had become far more sexualised so that the magazine began to look more like the porn magazines from which it had once sought to distance itself.Man About Town magazine covers Magforum, 21 November 2012. Retrieved 2 June 2014. The magazine ceased publication in 1968. Competition The failure of Town and similar British non-pornographic men's magazines like Men in Vogue and the British version of Esquire in the 1950s, has been blamed on the smaller size of the market in the United Kingdom compared to the United States and competition for advertising from commercial television and newspaper colour supplements.

It is characterised by the unusual reseda green colour of the shanks.  History  The Green-legged Partridge was first described by Bronis≈Çaw Obfidowicz in 1879. In 1894 a flock was shown by Roman Ujejski at the in Lviv. A breed standard was drawn up by Maurycy Trybulski in 1921, and the breed was officially recognised in 1923. From 1930 it was raised in some 70% of the country. However, egg production was found to be variable, and birds did not adapt well to intensive management. Numbers declined; between 1961 and 1973 its percentage of the national chicken population fell from 11.4% to 1‚Äì2%. Conservation efforts began in the 1970s. Between 1946 and 1954 Laura Kaufman crossed the Green-legged Partridge breed with American Plymouth Rock birds to create the Polbar. The aim was to introduce the barred gene of the Plymouth Rock to make chicks auto-sexing ‚Äì female Polbar chicks can be distinguished from males at one day old by the longer black eye-stripe. There are two strains of the Green-legged Partridge, each with one flock; both populations are closed. The ZK strain has since 1945 been kept at Felin near Lublin, in the eastern part of the country, by the University of Life Sciences of that city. It is kept for conservation only. At the end of 2014 there were 1170 birds. The Z11 strain was kept at ≈ªyczyn from 1972 until 1995, when it was moved to the experimental station in Chorzel√≥w.  Use and management  The Green-legged Partridge is well adapted to extensive management; it forages well and is resistant to disease. It is not suited to intensive management, and becomes subject to cannibalism, feather loss and feather-pulling if kept closely enclosed. Egg-laying performance is generally poor; the yolk of the eggs has a low cholesterol content compared to that found in other breeds. Both meat and eggs have good flavour. The breed is kept only for reasons of conservation.

As the name suggests, it is a type of tuff found in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is a form of welded ignimbrite. Brisbane tuff comes in a variety of colours: pink, green, blue (grey) and purple. The different colours are due to the extent of oxidation of iron and manganese. It is often incorrectly described as porphyry.  History  Brisbane tuff began to be used during the period when Captain Patrick Logan was the commandant of the Moreton Bay penal colony. Brisbane tuff is found in various parts of Brisbane and was quarried extensively in the early history of Brisbane at the Kangaroo Point Cliffs and the (now) Windsor Town Quarry Park for use in construction of Brisbane's earliest buildings.  Geology  Brisbane tuff was formed by the compaction of volcanic ash more than 226 million years ago. It displays pyroclastic flows of rock fragments deposited as the volanic ash was forming. Layers of Brisbane tuff can be over thick. It is a form of welded ignimbrite. Brisbane tuff comes in a variety of colours: pink, green, blue (grey) and purple. The different colours are due to the extent of oxidation of iron and manganese. Construction Brisbane tuff has been used in the construction of the following Brisbane buildings, many of them now heritage-listed: * Commissariat Store * Cathedral of St Stephen * Old Bishopsbourne Chapel (also known as Chapel of the Holy Spirit) * St Martin's House * St Mary's Anglican Church, Kangaroo Point * Manor Apartment Hotel (former Colonial Mutual Life building) using Benedict stone File:Commissariat Store, Brisbane 10.jpgCommissariat Store File:St Stephen's cathedral, Brisbane.jpgSt Stephen's cathedral File:Old Bishopsbourne Chapel.jpgOld Bishopsbourne Chapel File:Former St Martin's Hospital, Brisbane 052013.jpgSt Martin's House File:St Mary's Anglican Church, Kangaroo Point, Brisbane, West Front (2009-01-29).JPGSt Mary's Anglican Church, Kangaroo Point  Benedict stone  Benedict Stone Factory at Bowen Hills, circa 1934 Benedict stone is a mixture of cement and crushed Brisbane tuff used on building facades as an alternative to full stone construction. It was manufactured by Benedict Stone (Qld) Pty Ltd which was established by Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig, to manufacture the stone required for the Holy Name Cathedral, Fortitude Valley. The product was developed at the turn of the twentieth century by American manufacturer, Benedict. Duhig obtained a licence from America and opened the Benedict Stone works at Bowen Hills on 9 August 1929. In February 1930 Colonial Mutual Life (CML) advanced Duhig a mortgage on his properties which included the stone works. A mutually-dependent relationship developed between CML, Duhig and Jack Hennessey, architect. CML used Benedict stone to build a number of their Australian offices, ensuring some of their mortgage was repaid and employed Hennessey and Concrete Constructions (Qld) Ltd, Brisbane (Duhig's architect and contractor for the Holy Name Cathedral). Tunnelling The extent and hardness of Brisbane tuff deposits has often been a barrier to building tunnels in Brisbane due to its 100‚Äì150 megapascal strength. However, since 2007, advances in tunnel-boring equipment with tungsten carbide cutting heads has enabled a number of major tunnels to be constructed in Brisbane, e.g. the Clem Jones Tunnel which passes through the Kangaroo Point area.

Freud, On Psychopathology (PFL 10) p. 88 and the same phantasies were in turn turned into shareable (public) artistic constructs by the creative writer, where they could serve as cultural surrogates for the universal instinctual renunciations inherent in civilization.S. Freud, Civilization, Society and Religion (PFL 12) p. 193 Artistic technique Freud saw the aesthetic principle as the ability to turn the private phantasy into a public artefact, using artistic pleasure to release a deeper pleasure founded on the release of forbidden (unconscious) material.Peter Gay, Freud (1989) p. 308 The process allowed the writer him/herself to emerge from their introversion and return to the public world.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 479 If the phantasies came too close to the unconscious repressed, however, the process would fail, leading either to creative inhibition or to a rejection of the artwork itself.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 217 Freud himself epitomised his essay's argument a decade later in his Introductory Lectures,S. Freud, Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis (PFL 1) p. 423-3 stating of the true artist that: > \\"he understands how to work over his daydreams in such a way as to make them > lose what is too personal in them and repels strangers, and to make it > possible for others to share in the enjoyment of them.

Each ahupuaau was then run by a headman or chief called a Konohiki. In Keelikolani vs Robinson, the term is also defined as a Land Agent. In Territory vs Bishop Trust Co. LTD., when the agent was appointed by a chief they were referred to by the title of konohiki. When referring to the titled person as Konohiki, this meant that they were charged with the care of the division of land for the king or nobility the land was awarded to. The term could also be a designated area of land owned privately as compared to being owned by the government. A chief of lands could not lose life tenure on the land even after being discharged from the position, but a head man overseeing the same land has no such right. Often ali ªi and konohiki are referenced together; however, while most or all konohiki were ali ªi nobility, not all ali ªi were konohiki. The Hawaiian dictionary gives the definition as a headman of a land division, but it is also used in describing fishing rights as well. The term when broken in two parts is as follows: Kono being defined as to entice, or prompt and hiki defined as something that can be done. The konohiki was a relative of the ali ªi and would oversee the coordination of the property, including water rights, land distribution, agricultural use and any maintenance. The Konohiki would also make sure the right amounts of gifts and tributes to the ali ªi were properly made at the right times. As capitalism was incorporated into the kingdom the konohiki would become the tax collectors, landlords and wardens over the fisheries.

He is a politician from Singapore‚Äôs main governing political party, the People‚Äôs Action Party and is also currently serving in the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) as the Assistant Secretary-General. Zainal is a graduate of Nanyang Technological University with a Master of Arts in Educational Management, through which he has served for 20 years in the education service before embarking on his political career.  Early life and career  Zainal came from a family of seven, with his father working as a rank-and-file employee and his mother providing domestic assistance to an expatriate family. Zainal was a St John‚Äôs cadet in Saint Andrew‚Äôs Secondary School where he was given positions of responsibility and developed his leadership skills. While in Temasek Junior College, he actively participated in sports and represented in his schools‚Äô annual sports meet. He was also the chief editor of an in-house Malay language publication of his junior college. In 1986, Zainal was awarded the government‚Äôs Special Malay bursary where he became the first person in his family to pursue university education. He continued his education in National University of Singapore to graduate with a Post-Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) which propelled him into his career in education service. Zainal further his education in Nanyang Technological University in 2007 to attain a Master's of Arts in Educational Management. Zainal became a teacher, and subsequently became a school principal and then a superintendent with the Ministry of Education, overseeing a cluster of 12 schools in the east area.  Career in labor movement and politics  Labour movement Zainal started out union work with the Building Construction And Timber Industries Employees' Union (BATU) as a Director (Special Duty) of Industrial Relations, which was aligned to his interest in aiding low-wage workers. He progressed on to become the Assistant Secretary-General of NTUC and Director of NTUC Care and Share Department which helps low-wage workers, and casual and contract workers. In the 2011 General Elections, Zainal was voted into the parliament of Singapore as one of the 5 team members of the PAP led by Minister Teo Chee Hean. The team won the contest for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC over Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) led by Harminder Pal Singh with a victory of 64.79%. In Parliament, Zainal lobbied for the Progressive Wage Model which was an improved form of minimum wage in Singapore, intent on helping low-wage workers. Zainal asked the ministry to commission a study on the living wage in Singapore before the implementation. The Progressive Wage Model was implemented in the cleaning and security sector first, followed by other sectors in the coming years. To further protect the wages of the low-wage workers, Zainal also urged the Government to lead the charge in best sourcing in order to end ‚Äúcheap sourcing‚Äù, as it will take a toll on the wages of these workers. He clearly made his stand that cheap sourcing is a ‚Äúgross injustice and slavery of the poor‚Äù that has to be put to a stop. Zainal worked very closely with the Ministry of Education, his previous employer, in implementing the Progressive Wage Model in schools as the school cleaners represent the biggest workforce of the cleaning sector in Singapore. On top of the Progressive Wage Model, Zainal was also lobbying for mandatory payslips to be enforced in the Employment Act, in a bid to prevent salary related disputes, which especially affects the casual and contract workers, and also low-wage workers. The enforcement is still in process and it is projected to come into implementation within the next two years. Before the 2017 Singapore presidential elections (which was reserved for the Malay community), Zainal expressed a view that the various candidates were all \\"Malay\\" enough for the reserved election, and that Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob should qualify to run in the reserved election. He also shared an article which disagreed with Mendaki's \\"shallow and rigid definition of what is Malay\\". Besides his duties in Parliament and the NTUC, Zainal participates in grassroots activities. Zainal pushed for an extension of the assistance scheme Enhanced Purple Heart Programme in his constituency, where needy families in Pasir Ris East received food vouchers to supplement their monthly expenditures. Zainal takes a hands-on approach to push his agenda for low-wage workers. He even became a cleaner for one morning in order to gain first-hand experience of the difficulties faced by cleaners. Zainal did not stand in the 2020 Singaporean general election, but however will remain as a PAP member.  Philanthropic work  Zainal's main philanthropic work is focused on his areas of interest which is low waged workers and disadvantaged members of society. During his tenure in the Ministry of Education, Zainal volunteered at Darul Ihsan, a Muslim orphanage, where he served in the Education Sub-Committee from 2004‚Äì2006. He is also a patron of HIRA society, a welfare organisation aimed at mentoring and providing guidance to ex-drug offenders to help re-establish them back into society.  Personal life  Zainal is married and has 6 children.

Plot summary The story follows a fictional family named the Lleshi. The Lleshis are an Albanian family living in Kosovo, which is in the midst of a war. The family suddenly finds themselves homeless refugees in the middle of a violent war. After enduring much hardship, including hunger, illness and a dangerous journey to escape their situation, they are surprised when a church group brings them to America. They find themselves in a small town in Vermont when the events of September 11, 2001 take place, placing more challenges in the path of this Muslim family. Reception Critical reception for The Day of the Pelican has been largely positive. The Christian Science Monitor was more positive and wrote that it \\"does double duty as both a gripping read and a lesson in compassion and global conflict. In her quiet way, Meli is a hero, and teen readers safe from conflict themselves may marvel at her humanity.\\" The University of Arizona's Worlds of Words was critical of the book and of Paterson's choice to focus on an Albanian family, as they felt that she \\"justifies the oppression that they undergo and she does not mention what happened to Serbian and Bosnian Muslims during that horrific event in the heart of Europe. Further, by not focusing on presenting the physical torture and rape that the Muslims underwent due to ‚Äòethnic cleansing‚Äô Patterson does not do justice to the actual historical events and the audience comes away with a skewed version of the actual events.\\" References 2009 American novels 2009 children's books American children's novels American young adult novels Novels set in Serbia Novels set in Kosovo Novels set in Vermont Novels about war and conflict Novels about immigration to the United States ","title":"The Day of the Pelican"},{"id":"42943129","title":"French Consulate of Cape Town"},{"id":"42943134","text":"Battalia rhopalodes is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Apffel Park, Galveston Island, Texas, 2014. Pink Dolphin Monument is a public monument in R.A. Apffel Park/East Beach on Galveston Island, Texas. Inaugurated on July 25, 2014, the monument is dedicated to celebrating gender and sexual minority communities. It is the first monument dedicated to gender and sexual minorities in the southern United States.  History  The Pink Dolphin Monument was created by artist Joe Joe Orangias, in collaboration with writer Dr. Sarah Sloane and scientist Dr. Frank Pega. Orangias carved the monument‚Äôs central figure - a pink dolphin - from red sandstone sourced from the Texas coast. The image of the pink dolphin references the historic Pink Dolphin Tavern located in the city of Galveston. It also refers to the logo of the Pink Posse, a local group of gender and sexual minority activists. Orangias donated the monument to R.A. Apffel Park/East Beach to further the Park‚Äôs mission and contribute to honoring diversity on the island. ‚ÄúThere are starting to be more monuments for gender and sexual minorities around the world, so this piece adds to that network,‚Äù the artist told the Galveston Daily News. In 2015, Pink Dolphin Monument was featured in the \\"Island Time\\" exhibition at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. Due to vandalism, artist Ryan Hawk completed a restoration project of the statue in 2019.  Design  The main statue is the approximate size of a small dolphin (36‚Äù x 16‚Äù x 13‚Äù). It is supported by a five-foot plinth, which is designed to create an impression of a dolphin jumping overhead, in the Gulf of Mexico surrounding Galveston Island. The monument is housed in an open-aired pavilion and its pedestal replicates the columns that hold up the pavilion. The statue is accompanied by the following poem: ‚à© The path that led you here through giant gold headdresses shaking in the wind below a long calligraphy of stars - finds you standing in R.A. Apffel Park lit by dreams of dolphins rising pink arches in the dark ‚à© The carving of the dolphin statue resulted in 243 chips from the original sandstone boulder. Orangias carved these into 243 triangles and buried these on Galveston Island to further memorialize gender and sexual minorities into the landscape. The dust from carving the statue was collected and then poured into the ocean by participants at the unveiling ceremony.

His predominant style would be termed \\"Edwardian Classic\\". Life Oldrieve was from a deeply religious Baptist family. He was born in Totnes, Devonhttp://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales- births-1837-2006?lastname=oldrieve&eventyear;=1853&eventyear;_offset=0 the son of William Oldrieve, Clerk of Works and Elizabeth Tyler. He was educated at Mansfield Grammar School in Nottinghamshire then served an apprenticeship (1868‚Äì71) with his father at Thoresby Hall in Budby, Nottinghamshire, under Anthony Slavin. He then moved to the engineering offices of William Cubitt & Co (1871-3) working under Joseph Cubitt. From there he obtained a post in the War Office attached in a design role to the Royal Engineers, and establishing a lifelong link as an architect/engineer in a civil service capacity. He remained attached to the Royal Engineers until 1881, during which time he was posted to Edinburgh Castle, a building with which he continued a permanent interest alongside his given role of maintaining its fabric. Soon after he began a deeper interest in design and began to study architecture under Professor Baldwin Brown. He was a gifted student and won several prizes including a travelling scholarship to Europe where he took a particular interest in Post Office design, a field in which he chose to specialise. He was impressed by designs he found in Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna and Paris. On his return he was appointed Architect for Provincial Post Offices in England and Wales. This role gave a great deal of freedom as to whether these buildings should be functional or done with flair. Oldrieve chose the latter. In 1904 (following the retiral of Walter W. Robertsonhttp://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=201227) he was appointed Principal Architect for Scotland, an extremely prestigious role. Oddly this predated his actual acceptance into the professional body, the RIBA, by two years. His role brought him closer to the duty of protecting Ancient Monuments in Britain and his research work deepened, resulting in a paper in 1908 on The Royal Palaces of Scotland, and papers on the archaeological investigations then ongoing at Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh. He retired from public work in 1914 but continued in a consultative role in a newly formed partnership entitled Oldrieve Bell & Paterson. This was with William Wilson Paterson a former Office of Works colleague, and Andrew W Bell the former Dunfermline Burgh Engineer. In 1917, with the First World War ongoing, he was appointed Secretary for the Ministry of Munitions. He was at the same time undergoing a major study, the National Art Survey for Scotland, with the aid of Robert Rowand Anderson and Thomas Ross. On his Christian side he also played a major role. In Edinburgh he was an elder of the Morningside Baptist Church, President of the Baptist Union (1915), President of Carrubbers Close Mission, and a director of the National Bible Society for Scotland. His last known address is 11 Merchiston Gardens in south-west Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1911 He died of stomach cancer on 12 January 1922. He is buried in Morningside Cemetery, Edinburgh. The grave lies in a north west row towards the south-west. It is currently lying flat, having been vandalised. Family He was married to Emma Goodchild (d.1929). Their son, Frank Oldrieve, trained as a minister and became Secretary of the Leper Mission in India.

The bird, a male of the Calidris canutus rufa subspecies of the red knot (a species of shorebird in the sandpiper family), was banded in R√≠o Grande, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina in February 1995 by Patricia Gonz√°lez, an Argentine biologist. It has been resighted many times since then, most recently during May 2014 by Gonz√°lez in the Canadian Arctic. It also has been recaptured at least three times‚Äîthe last time in 2007 (aged approximately 14) when it was found to be \\"as fit as a three-year-old\\". It is not known how long red knots typically live. Migration Although more formally known as B95 (from the \\"B95\\" label on the orange band on its leg), it is nicknamed \\"Moonbird\\" because its annual migrations along the Atlantic Flyway between Tierra del Fuego and the Canadian Arctic have in total exceeded the distance to the Moon. It flies approximately a year. In its migration from Tierra del Fuego, B95 stops off in Delaware Bay in the Northern Hemisphere in spring to feed on horseshoe crab eggs, before proceeding to breeding grounds on an island in the north of Hudson Bay. The red knot population has declined since the 1990s because of the harvesting of Delaware Bay's horseshoe crabs for bait; hence restrictions on harvesting have been put in place. Migrating back to Tierra del Fuego in November for the Southern Hemisphere spring, red knots feed on mussels in the restinga tidal flats there.

In the 1960s, a Singapore government policy forbidding any male to sport long hair went into effect. This was in response to the growing popularity of the hippie subculture worldwide; the government deemed such an influence to be negative and detrimental to the country's development. The consequences for defying the long hair ban varied from getting fined to having one's hair being forcefully cut short. Additionally, it was ordered by the government that long-haired males be given the lowest priority when it came to requesting for help at government facilities. Long-haired male foreigners entering the country were requested to leave. Among others, the Bee Gees, Kitar≈ç, and Led Zeppelin all were forced to cancel their gigs in Singapore because they refused to accommodate the policy. The ban caused repercussions for the country after its introduction, straining ties between Singapore and other countries. Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew even had to cancel a business trip owing to heavy protests by a few individuals affected by the ban. It was finally lifted in the 1990s. In 2013, local newspaper The Straits Times included the ban in its list of fifty objects identifiable to Singapore. Background The hippie (also spelt as hippy) subculture movement arose in the United States in the 1960s. Other countries were quick to pick up this youth movement. Among other traits, hippies were supposed to sport long hair. Hippies in the West were said to consume great amounts of illegal drugs. Ban The Singapore Government claimed that so-called hippies were negative influences for Singaporeans capable of \\"corrupting\\" their minds and \\"polluting\\" the country's society. Adopting an anti-hippy stance, the government introduced an official policy dissuading males from having long hair. In the first few years after the policy's introduction, the consequences for not abiding by it were relatively mild: long-haired males spotted by the police were forced to cut it short. In addition, should they have been civil servants, they were at risk of losing their livelihoods or, if lucky, receive a strict warning for \\"flouting discipline\\". Lastly, any male with long hair was automatically given the lowest priority at government facilities. Posters outside these places proclaimed, \\"Males with long hair will be attended to last\\". In 1976, long- haired men in Singapore who worked for the government started to get fined a sum of S$200. The other possible consequences also remained. The ban also applied not just to the locals, but also the foreigners, visiting or working. It was officially lifted in the 1990s. =Incidents= In August 1970, Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew had to cancel his official business trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to handle the uproar caused by the apprehension of three long-haired youths from Malaysia, which many found to be controversial and unjustified. Lee organised a press conference, where he formally apologised to the affected parties. Long-haired male tourists attempting to enter Singapore were made to visit the barber or leave the country. Those who took the latter option were barred from re-entering the country for months even if they already got their hair cut. In 1972, a few protesting Australian tourists reportedly urged the masses to boycott Singapore. The Australian High Commission took note of their dissatisfaction, and promptly made a formal inquiry into the incident, though admitting that it was not its prerogative to complain about it. In 1974, 8,172 male government workers were called up for having long hair. Some eleven of them were fined, whilst four others left the government. Although the ban by right only applied to men, a handful of female schoolchildren in Singapore were reported to have had their long hair forcefully cut short after being warned countless times. In justification, the school's principal, who was responsible for cutting their hair, claimed that she was following the law. Japanese entertainer Kitar≈ç was forced to cancel his 1984 gig in Singapore because of his long hair, which he refused to cut. Similarly, Cliff Richard, Led Zeppelin and the Bee Gees were all supposed to perform in Singapore at different points in time but left because of the ban. =Aftermath= The ban is frequently mentioned in books about Singapore, to exemplify the fact about it being strict in terms of discipline. In 1982, Australian rock band Little River Band released the song \\"Down On The Border\\", in which a reference to the ban on long hair is made in the lyrics \\"And I never will go to Singapore/The people there will cut your hair/In Singapore\\". The ban has been compared with Singapore's ban on chewing gum. In November 2013, The Straits Times listed it as one of the fifty items relating to Singapore's history.

They appear to be localised to the Minch and surrounding areas, unknown in other parts of Scotland and without counterparts in the rest of the world. Apart from their blue colour, the mythical creatures look much like humans, and are about the same size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float sleeping on or just below the surface of the water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to capsize his ship. Suggestions to explain the mythical blue men include that they may be a personification of the sea, or originate with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch. Etymology The Minch, a strait that separates the northwest Highlands of Scotland and the northern Inner Hebrides from the northern Outer Hebrides, is home to the blue men. The Scottish Gaelic terms for the blue men is na fir ghorma (in the genitive fear gorm, for example sruth nam fear gorm \\"the stream of the blue men\\"). The blue men are also styled as storm kelpies. The most common water spirits in Scottish folklore, kelpies are usually described as powerful horses, but the name is attributed to several different forms and fables throughout the country. The name kelpie may be derived from the Scottish Gaelic calpa or cailpeach, meaning \\"heifer\\" or \\"colt\\". Folk beliefs =Description and common attributes= The mythical blue men may have been part of a tribe of \\"fallen angels\\" that split into three; the first became the ground dwelling fairies, the second evolved to become the sea inhabiting blue men, and the remainder the \\"Merry Dancers\\" of the Northern Lights in the sky. The legendary creatures are the same size as humans but, as the name implies, blue in colour. Writer and journalist Lewis Spence thought they were the \\"personifications of the sea itself\\" as they took their blue colouration from the hue of the sea. Their faces are grey and long in shape and some have long arms, which are also grey, and they favour blue headgear; at least one account claims they also have wings. The tempestuous water around the Shiant Isles to the north of Skye, an area subject to rapid tides in all weathers, flows beside the caves inhabited by the blue men, a stretch of water known as the Current of Destruction owing to the number of ships wrecked there. Although other storm kelpies are reported as inhabiting the Gulf of Corrievreckan, described by poet, writer and folklorist Alasdair Alpin MacGregor as \\"the fiercest of the Highland storm kelpies\\", the blue men are confined to a very restricted area. According to Donald A. Mackenzie they have no counterparts elsewhere in the world or even in other areas of Scotland; such limited range is rare for beliefs in spirits and demons. Folklorist and Tiree minister John Gregorson Campbell says they were unknown in Argyll on the nearby coast of the mainland for instance, although Church of Scotland minister John Brand, who visited Quarff in Shetland in mid-1700, recounts a tale of what may have been a blue man in the waters around the island. In the form of a bearded old man it rose out of the water, terrifying the passengers and crew of a boat it was following. In traditional tales the blue men have the power to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize. When the blue men gather to attack passing vessels their chief, sometimes named as Shony, rises up out of the water and shouts two lines of poetry to the skipper, and if he cannot add two lines to complete the verse the blue men seize his boat. Mackenzie highlights the following exchange between the skipper of a boat and the chief of the blue men: The quick responses took the blue chief by surprise; defeated and unable to do any damage to the vessel, the blue men returned to their underwater caves, allowing the vessel free passage through the strait. The blue men may alternatively board a passing vessel and demand tribute from its crew, threatening that if it is not forthcoming they will raise up a storm. =Capture and killing= No surviving tales mention attempts to kill the demons, but a Gregorson Campbell story tells of the capture of a blue man. Sailors seize a blue man and tie him up on board their ship after he is discovered \\"sleeping on the waters\\". Two fellow blue men give chase, calling out to each other as they swim towards the ship: On hearing his companions' voices the captured spirit breaks free of his bonds and jumps overboard as he answers: Sailors thus believed all blue men have names by which they address each other. Origins The mythical blue men may have originated with the Tuareg people of the Sahara. Mackenzie's explanation of the legend of the blue men was based partly on research into the Annals of Ireland and goes back to the times of Harald Fairhair, the first Norse king, and his battles against the Vikings. The Scottish Gaelic term fir ghorma, meaning \\"blue men\\", is the descriptor for a black man according to Dwelly. Thus sruth nam fear gorm, one of the blue men's Gaelic names, literally translates as \\"stream of the blue men\\", or \\"river, tide or stream of the black man\\". Around the 9th century the Vikings took Moors they had captured and were using as slaves to Ireland. The Vikings spent winter months near the Shiant Isles, and Mackenzie attributes the story of the blue men to \\"marooned foreign slaves\\". He quotes an excerpt from historian Alan Orr Anderson's Early sources of Scottish history, A.D. 500 to 1286: More recent newspaper reports have repeated Mackenzie's hypothesis. Historian Malcolm Archibald agrees the legend originates from the days Norsemen had North African slaves, but speculates that the myth may have originated with the Tuareg people of Saharan Africa, who were known as the \\"blue men of the desert\\". The origin of the blue men of the Minch may alternatively lie with \\"tattooing people\\" specifically the Picts, whose Latin name picti means \\"painted people\\". If they were seen crossing the water in boats resembling the kayaks of the Finn-men they may have given simple islanders and mariners the impression of the upper part of the body rising out of the water.

Life Ted Cooke-Yarborough was the only child of George Eustace Cooke-Yarborough, a Justice of the Peace, and his wife Daphne. He was born at Campsall in the Yorkshire West Riding, northern England. Cooke-Yarborough was educated at Canford School in Dorset, southern England, where he built his first wireless equipment, and studied Physics at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was President of the University Physics Society. During World War II, he worked as part of the secret Air Ministry RDF radar project, initially in Dundee and then at Swanage within the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE). He led a team that produced an automatic airborne radar system, used to warn aircrews of aircraft approaching from behind. He continued his work in radar at Malvern and then on guided weapons in the United States. After WWII, he was sent on a Combined Intelligence mission to interview German scientists concerning their development work on radar and guided weapons and. In 1946, Cooke-Yarborough joined UK Atomic Energy programme to work on nuclear instrumentation. Soon after his transfer to the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell (AERE Harwell) in 1948, he supervised the production of the Harwell Dekatron Computer, working with fellow designers Dick Barnes and Gurney Thomas. All three visited the EDSAC computer in Cambridge during the design stage. In 1951, Cooke-Yarborough attended the first Bell Labs symposium on the transistor. Afterwards he developed the Harwell CADET computer, which was one of the first digital computers to use transistors. in 1957, Cooke-Yarborough was appointed as head of the Electronics Division at AERE Harwell, and published \\"An Introduction to Transistor Circuits\\". In 1980, Cooke-Yarborough was elected Fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering (later to become the Royal Academy of Engineering) and was appointed Chief Research Scientist at AERE until he retired in 1982. On 20 November 2012, Cooke-Yarborough attended the reboot of the Harwell Dekatron Computer at the National Museum of Computing, the last time that he appeared in public.

He went to jail and he was Minister of Defence and the Governor of V√§sterbotten County. He is known for children's day in Ume√•, beech lined country roads and temperance. Life Ros√©n was born in Vallsj√∂ in 1876. He was the second of eleven children born to Per Gustaf and Christina Ottilia Andersson (born Engdahla), a railway worker and his wife. He left school when his family could no longer finance his education and turned to the military to complete it. He graduated as an officer after three years of training with excellent results, but he quickly left the army. He then worked for a number of years on the northern railway construction of the Ofotenbanan. Ros√©n was a Swedish newspaper owner. In 1902 he married Tyra Edit Olivia Lindforss from S√§var near Ume√•. That same year, he helped to found the Liberal National Association. In 1903 he published a book about his time working on Ofotenbanan criticising the maladministration he had observed.Gustav Rosen, Ohlin Institute, retrieved 2 June 2014 He began working as a journalist at V√§sterbottens-Kuriren, a newspaper published in Ume√• for northern Swedes in V√§sterbotten County. Under his leadership it rose to be the largest newspaper in the county.EJ Gustav Ros√©n, Rosen, Swedish Biographical Dictionary (art by Birgit Petersson), Retrieved 2014-06-02. He championed the rights of all classes with his liberal attitude. Rosen came to own the newspaper after thwarting a plot designed to transfer the ownership to his right wing opponents. Rosen had successfully championed a Children's Day in Ume√• for the local children, and in 1910 he successfully ran to join the town council. He became a member of parliament, where he worked on Defence issues as well as championing the temperance cause. Temperance was a matter of national concern, but Ros√©n believed that this should be settled at a more local level. He was aware that the tax on alcohol meant that a temperate tax payer may see it as in interest to allow others, who did consume alcohol, to pay the tax bill. In 1922 the national referendum on alcohol was rejected, but because of Ros√©n alcohol was prohibited in V√§sterbotten County by an 81% majority. Rosen and his children His writings were not popular with the establishment and he was taken to court in 1915 for libelling a superintendent. Faced by a jury of three that included his political opponents, he was sentenced to three months in what is now Ume√• Old Prison. When he left prison he was met by cheers from the waiting crowd. Ros√©n played a role in the Folkpartiet (Liberal People's Party) in Sweden.

This placed him in a difficult position squeezed between the military and his political opponents who noted his difficulties. After his party lost power on 2 October 1928, Gustav Ros√©n returned to Ume√• in 1929. Ros√©n was made the Governor of V√§sterbotten County from 1931 until his death in 1942, in Ume√•. As governor he worked for simple roads, and had over 900 routes built to open up the countryside and permit travel. He believed that he needed to improve communication to the thousand villages and farms that lacked any roads. He also encouraged the population to grow more plants, and in his residence in Umea he planted ash, elm and oak to lead by example. Rosen became known for the policy of planting birch trees along the country roads that he authorised. These tree-lined avenues not only kept traffic in the shade, but the trees enabled travellors to find the road when the ground was covered in snow.Umea Tourist Guide , Ivar Torneus, Digital Umea, retrieved 2 June 2014 Ros√©n was an ambassador for Norrland and wrote to change the perceptions of his fellow Swedes.

Srihari, Rami Reddy, Brahmanandam, and Sudhakar play supporting roles The music is composed by M. M. Keeravani. The film was dubbed into Tamil as Pokkiri Kaadhalan.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmjcjKo5PHg Plot Krishna Murthy alias Kittu (Jagapati Babu) always bets for money with Chandram alias Pandem Chandra Rao (Sudhakar). Once, there is a bet that Kittu makes Bhavani (Rambha), Jhansi (Soundarya), and Jogeswari Devi (Kanchan) fall for him, and he agrees to that. Kittu is a musician in a hotel. Bhavani is a college student who fights for women. Knowing this, Kittu pretends to be a man who respects women. His friend Ahobilam (Brahmanandam) pretends as a rowdy named Khan Dada, and they play a drama in front of Bhavani that Kittu beat Khan Dada's henchman who harassed a girl. As a result, Bhavani falls for Kittu. Jhansi is a police inspector. Kittu hires a goon (Narsing Yadav) to kidnap her younger brother and pretends to save him. The boy sees Kittu giving money to the goon. Jhansi thanks him and invites him to lunch. The boy tells Jhansi that Kittu gave money to the goon, and Jhansi understands that the kidnapping is Kittu's drama. She arrests Kittu and asks why he played the drama, and he tells her that he loves her. Jhansi also falls for Kittu. Jogeswari Devi is a sannyasi. Kittu and Ahobilam go for her, and Kittu sexually arouses her with whore dialogues. Devi too falls for Kittu. Bhairavaiah (Rami Reddy) kidnapped Devi in her childhood and made her a sannyasi to earn money. In happiness, Kittu and Ahobilam drink alcohol beverages and talk about how they cheated the three women. Bhavani listens to them when they talk about how they cheated her. In anger, she hires a goon named Malli to fight Kittu and lets him come to the spot. Ahobilam sees Bhavani and cautions Kittu. Malli tries to molest Bhavani. Kittu comes in time and confronts Malli. Bhavani apologizes to Kittu and proposes to him. Kittu tells Chandram that all the three women have fallen for him and asks for the money. Chandram asks him to prove it, and he informs the women to come to Golconda at different times. Bhavani and Jhansi go there and write their names with his name in the love symbol on the walls of the tombs and tell him that they love him and they go their homes. Devi writes her name with Kittu's name in the love symbol. While Kittu is returning after skating around the tombs, Devi is shot by Hari (Srihari) as told by Bhairavaiah and tells Kittu that she loves him before dying. Bhairavaiah calls the police to get Kittu arrested. Chandram misunderstands the situation and thinks that Kittu killed Devi. Chandram and his assistant (AVS) escape from the place. Ahobilam takes Kittu away. Bhairavaiah shows Jhansi the names of Bhavani, Devi, and Jhansi with Kittu's name and tells her that Kittu is a womanizer. Jhansi believes his words and searches for Kittu. Kittu goes to Chandram's house to prove his innocence. There, Chandram's elder brother Hari and Bhairavaiah talk to each other. Chandram and Kittu come to know who the murderer is. Kittu confronts Hari. Bhairavaiah calls the police. Jhansi comes there, and Kittu escapes to Bhavani's home. Jhansi chases Kittu and asks Bhavani about him. She lies that he did not come there. Bhavani believes that he did not murder Devi. Kittu escapes from there to the government hospital. Jhansi understands that Kittu came there and escaped. She threatens Ahobilam to tell about Kittu. He tells her that Kittu often goes to the government hospital. She goes there. Knowing this, Bhavani also goes there to save him, but Jhansi catches Kittu and asks why he murdered Devi and why he played the love dramas with many women. Then, Kittu reveals his past. He and Swapna (Ramya Krishna) loved each other, but her grandfather Gajapati (Kaikala Satyanarayana) rejected him. Swapna left her family and married Kittu. She later got pregnant. Hari wants his paternal uncle Gajapati's property and plans to kill Swapna. He sent a goon and beat Swapna on the road. She gave birth to a mentally unstable baby girl because of the assault by the goon and had unfortunately died because of pregnancy complications. Kittu earns money on bets for his daughter's operation. Actually, it is Hari who tells Chandram to bet with Kittu and make him love the women. Gajapati sticks for Swapna and writes the property in her name. Hari's plan is to get Kittu arrested and take the property. Hari and Bhairavaiah kidnap the girl from the hospital. Kittu confronts them, and later, Hari and Bhairavaiah die by running vehicles. The operation on the baby is successful, and Kittu marries Bhavani.

It has been operated since 1981 by the AKN Eisenbahn. History A ten km-long narrow gauge railway was opened from Elmshorn to Barmstedt via Elmshorn by the Elmshorn-Barmstedter Eisenbahn-AG (Elmshorn-Barmstedt Railway Company) on 15 July 1896. On 9 June 1907, this was taken over by the Elmshorn-Barmstedt- Oldesloer Eisenbahn-AG (Elmshorn-Barmstedt-Oldesloer Railway Company, EBOE), which was founded on 3 December 1904 in Elmshorn. On the same day, it opened the Barmstedt‚ÄìUlzburg (now Henstedt-Ulzburg)‚ÄìOldesloe (now Bad Oldesloe) line as a branch line and licensed the previous narrow-gauge railway as a branch line to allow through traffic to the state railway. The construction of the 42 km-long route cost around 2.9 million marks. Eight steam locomotives were available for operations. Last service of train 450 on 29 September 1973 in Wakendorf-G√∂tzberg Henstedt-Ulzburg station AKN train in Barmstedt station The now 53 km-long standard gauge route passes through a sparsely populated rural landscape. It was built throughout as a single track, but because of its strategic importance as an east-west connection and a northern bypass of Hamburg, its stations were given long passing loops. Passenger traffic was worthwhile only between Elmshorn and Barmstedt; the section between Barmstedt and Bad Oldesloe was converted to railcar services in 1931. Freight traffic was just adequate. After the division of Germany in 1945 it lacked through freight trains from the east. This improved after the opening of the border crossing at Herrnburg near L√ºbeck. Business closures and modal shifts ended these traffic flows in the 1970s. No money was available for necessary route reconstruction and the tracks were still laid in a gravel bed. On 29 September 1973, passenger traffic between Barmstedt and Bad Oldesloe was closed; a rail replacement service already operated between Barmstedt and Alveslohe. By the end of 1973, the EBOE had abandoned freight traffic from Barmstedt. For some time the AKN still ran freight from Alveslohe via Ulzburg to Henstedt. It was possible to operate freight between Ulzburg and Blumendorf until 31 December 1981. The four km-long remnant from Blumendorf station to Bad Oldesloe was operated as an industrial mainline track from Bad Oldesloe. The track between Ulzburg and Blumendorf has long since been dismantled. The trackless route has been converted to a cycle path. There are information boards close to this cycle path in the Wakendorf II area and it is Europe's longest path through fruit trees. Since 1965, the Elmshorn-Barmstedt line has been designated with the line name of EBO by the Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (Hamburg Transport Association, HVV). =The EBO as part of AKN Eisenbahn = The EBOE has been operated since 1981 by AKN Eisenbahn, which had already managed it since 1957. The section from Barmstedt to Ulzburg was used after its closure for operational movements. The workshop in Barmstedt was not sufficient for the maintenance of modern VT E railcars, but an alternative to upgrading the workshop was to renew the line between Barmstedt and Henstedt-Ulzburg. This was implemented up to 1991 and the workshop in Barmstedt was closed. Passenger services were resumed in 1992, initially with only a few trains daily, and the line was incorporated in the HVV. Since 1999, the line has been regularly operated from Ulzburg S√ºd (on the main line of the AKN) as line A3. Rollingstock As there were initially only light locomotives (with two two- axle carriages hauled by one of five three-axle locomotives of Prussian class T 3), freight made powerful locomotives more necessary. Between 1925 and 1940, locomotives with four or five axle were procured. In 1933, the first three two-axle railcars were used, they had been made in Gothaer Waggonfabrik. As a result, the number of services that could be operated increased from seven pairs of trains in 1930 to 22 pairs of trains. Four-axle railcars were procured in 1951 and 1953 and a MAN railbus was acquired in 1958. Due to the scrapping of the pre-war railcars from 1961, new and used Uerdingen railbuses were purchased. They were single-engined, like the VT 95, but had normal buffers and screw couplings. In order to rationalise vehicle classes, the MAN railbuses were transferred to the Alster Northern Railway in 1968 . With the acquisition by the AKN, it was operated with AKN rollingstock. Two of the Uerdinger railbuses are still operated for special events.

Built in 1898-99, they are among the city's finest examples of Romanesque architecture, built to support its burgeoning French Canadian population. The school closed in 1970, after which time the buildings have been used to house social service agencies and act as a community center. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The buildings of St. George's are located in a mainly residential area northeast of downtown Manchester, at the northeast corner of Pine and Orange Streets. The complex's former church, now occupied by a Protestant denomination, stands diagonally across Pine Street. The school and convent are a pair of connected three-story brick buildings, built out of red brick. The school is capped by a mansarded slate roof, and has paired windows set in either round-arch or segmented-arch surrounds on the first two floors. The convent has windows arranged in two- story round-arch panels on the lower floors and in simple rectangular openings on the third floor, which is separated from the lower floors by a stringcourse. The two buildings were constructed in 1898-99, along with the church, to serve the large French Canadian community that had migrated south from Quebec to work at the Amoskeag Mills, the city's largest employer. The complex is the city's only surviving Catholic facility of the period on the east side of the Merrimack River, and is one of its best examples of Romanesque architecture. The two buildings are connected by a brick connector constructed in 1915 when the convent was converted for academic use. In addition to its academic uses, it also served as a community center, hosting social events. This function continued even after the school closed in 1970 due to declining enrollment.

Therefore, it is a candidate for a unified physical theory. Instead of introducing physical objects on a preexisting spacetime manifold, the general concept is to derive spacetime as well as all the objects therein as secondary objects from the structures of an underlying causal fermion system. This concept also makes it possible to generalize notions of differential geometry to the non-smooth setting. In particular, one can describe situations when spacetime no longer has a manifold structure on the microscopic scale (like a spacetime lattice or other discrete or continuous structures on the Planck scale). As a result, the theory of causal fermion systems is a proposal for quantum geometry and an approach to quantum gravity. Causal fermion systems were introduced by Felix Finster and collaborators.  Motivation and physical concept  The physical starting point is the fact that the Dirac equation in Minkowski space has solutions of negative energy which are usually associated to the Dirac sea. Taking the concept seriously that the states of the Dirac sea form an integral part of the physical system, one finds that many structures (like the causal and metric structures as well as the bosonic fields) can be recovered from the wave functions of the sea states. This leads to the idea that the wave functions of all occupied states (including the sea states) should be regarded as the basic physical objects, and that all structures in spacetime arise as a result of the collective interaction of the sea states with each other and with the additional particles and \\"holes\\" in the sea. Implementing this picture mathematically leads to the framework of causal fermion systems. More precisely, the correspondence between the above physical situation and the mathematical framework is obtained as follows. All occupied states span a Hilbert space of wave functions in Minkowski space \\\\hat{M}. The observable information on the distribution of the wave functions in spacetime is encoded in the local correlation operators F(x), x \\\\in \\\\hat{M}, which in an orthonormal basis (\\\\psi_i) have the matrix representation : \\\\big( F(x) \\\\big)^i_j = - \\\\overline{\\\\psi_i(x)} \\\\psi_j(x) (where \\\\overline{\\\\psi} is the adjoint spinor). In order to make the wave functions into the basic physical objects, one considers the set \\\\\\\\{ F(x) \\\\,\\\\, x \\\\in \\\\hat{M} \\\\\\\\} as a set of linear operators on an abstract Hilbert space. The structures of Minkowski space are all disregarded, except for the volume measure d^4x, which is transformed to a corresponding measure on the linear operators (the \\"universal measure\\"). The resulting structures, namely a Hilbert space together with a measure on the linear operators thereon, are the basic ingredients of a causal fermion system. The above construction can also be carried out in more general spacetimes. Moreover, taking the abstract definition as the starting point, causal fermion systems allow for the description of generalized \\"quantum spacetimes.\\" The physical picture is that one causal fermion system describes a spacetime together with all structures and objects therein (like the causal and the metric structures, wave functions and quantum fields). In order to single out the physically admissible causal fermion systems, one must formulate physical equations. In analogy to the Lagrangian formulation of classical field theory, the physical equations for causal fermion systems are formulated via a variational principle, the so- called causal action principle. Since one works with different basic objects, the causal action principle has a novel mathematical structure where one minimizes a positive action under variations of the universal measure. The connection to conventional physical equations is obtained in a certain limiting case (the continuum limit) in which the interaction can be described effectively by gauge fields coupled to particles and antiparticles, whereas the Dirac sea is no longer apparent.  General mathematical setting  In this section the mathematical framework of causal fermion systems is introduced. = Definition of a causal fermion system = A causal fermion system of spin dimension n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} is a triple (\\\\mathcal H, \\\\mathcal F, \\\\rho) where * (\\\\mathcal H, \\\\langle .. \\\\rangle_{\\\\mathcal{H}}) is a complex Hilbert space. * \\\\mathcal F is the set of all self-adjoint linear operators of finite rank on \\\\mathcal H which (counting multiplicities) have at most n positive and at most n negative eigenvalues. * \\\\rho is a measure on \\\\mathcal F. The measure \\\\rho is referred to as the universal measure. As will be outlined below, this definition is rich enough to encode analogs of the mathematical structures needed to formulate physical theories. In particular, a causal fermion system gives rise to a spacetime together with additional structures that generalize objects like spinors, the metric and curvature. Moreover, it comprises quantum objects like wave functions and a fermionic Fock state. = The causal action principle = Inspired by the Langrangian formulation of classical field theory, the dynamics on a causal fermion system is described by a variational principle defined as follows. Given a Hilbert space (\\\\mathcal H, \\\\langle .. \\\\rangle_{\\\\mathcal{H}}) and the spin dimension n, the set \\\\mathcal F is defined as above. Then for any x,y \\\\in {\\\\mathcal{F}}, the product x y is an operator of rank at most 2n. It is not necessarily self- adjoint because in general (xy)^* = y x eq xy. We denote the non-trivial eigenvalues of the operator x y (counting algebraic multiplicities) by : \\\\lambda^{xy}_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda^{xy}_{2n} \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{C}} . Moreover, the spectral weight  .  is defined by :xy = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{2n} \\\\lambda^{xy}_i \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\big (xy)^2 \\\\big = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{2n} \\\\lambda^{xy}_i^2 {\\\\,}. The Lagrangian is introduced by :{\\\\mathcal{L}}(x,y) = \\\\big (xy)^2 \\\\big - \\\\frac{1}{2n} {\\\\,}xy^2 = \\\\frac{1}{4n} \\\\sum_{i,j=1}^{2n} \\\\big( \\\\lambda^{xy}_i - \\\\lambda^{xy}_j \\\\big)^2 \\\\geq 0 {\\\\,}. The causal action is defined by :{\\\\mathcal{S}}= \\\\iint_{{\\\\mathcal{F}}\\\\times {\\\\mathcal{F}}} {\\\\mathcal{L}}(x,y){\\\\,}d\\\\rho(x){\\\\,}d\\\\rho(y) {\\\\,}. The causal action principle is to minimize {\\\\mathcal{S}} under variations of \\\\rho within the class of (positive) Borel measures under the following constraints: * Boundedness constraint: \\\\iint_{{\\\\mathcal{F}}\\\\times {\\\\mathcal{F}}} xy^2 {\\\\,}d\\\\rho(x){\\\\,}d\\\\rho(y) \\\\leq C for some positive constant C. * Trace constraint: \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\int_{\\\\mathcal{F}} \\\\text{tr}(x) {\\\\,}d\\\\rho(x) is kept fixed. * The total volume \\\\rho({\\\\mathcal{F}}) is preserved. Here on {\\\\mathcal{F}}\\\\subset {\\\\mathrm{L}}({\\\\mathcal{H}}) one considers the topology induced by the \\\\sup-norm on the bounded linear operators on {\\\\mathcal{H}}. The constraints prevent trivial minimizers and ensure existence, provided that {\\\\mathcal{H}} is finite-dimensional. This variational principle also makes sense in the case that the total volume \\\\rho({\\\\mathcal{F}}) is infinite if one considers variations \\\\delta \\\\rho of bounded variation with (\\\\delta \\\\rho)({\\\\mathcal{F}})=0.  Inherent structures  In contemporary physical theories, the word spacetime refers to a Lorentzian manifold (M,g). This means that spacetime is a set of points enriched by topological and geometric structures. In the context of causal fermion systems, spacetime does not need to have a manifold structure. Instead, spacetime M is a set of operators on a Hilbert space (a subset of \\\\mathcal F). This implies additional inherent structures that correspond to and generalize usual objects on a spacetime manifold. For a causal fermion system (\\\\mathcal H, \\\\mathcal F, \\\\rho), we define spacetime M as the support of the universal measure, : M := \\\\text{supp} \\\\, \\\\rho \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{F}. With the topology induced by \\\\mathcal{F}, spacetime M is a topological space. = Causal structure = For x,y \\\\in M, we denote the non-trivial eigenvalues of the operator x y (counting algebraic multiplicities) by \\\\lambda^{xy}_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda^{xy}_{2n} \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{C}} . The points x and y are defined to be spacelike separated if all the \\\\lambda^{xy}_j have the same absolute value. They are timelike separated if the \\\\lambda^{xy}_j do not all have the same absolute value and are all real. In all other cases, the points x and y are lightlike separated. This notion of causality fits together with the \\"causality\\" of the above causal action in the sense that if two spacetime points x,y \\\\in M are space-like separated, then the Lagrangian {\\\\mathcal{L}}(x,y) vanishes. This corresponds to the physical notion of causality that spatially separated spacetime points do not interact. This causal structure is the reason for the notion \\"causal\\" in causal fermion system and causal action. Let \\\\pi_x denote the orthogonal projection on the subspace S_x := x({\\\\mathcal{H}}) \\\\subset {\\\\mathcal{H}}. Then the sign of the functional : i \\\\text{Tr} \\\\big( x\\\\, y \\\\, \\\\pi_x \\\\, \\\\pi_y - y \\\\, x \\\\, \\\\pi_y \\\\, \\\\pi_x) distinguishes the future from the past. In contrast to the structure of a partially ordered set, the relation \\"lies in the future of\\" is in general not transitive. But it is transitive on the macroscopic scale in typical examples. = Spinors and wave functions = For every x \\\\in M the spin space is defined by S_x = x({\\\\mathcal{H}}); it is a subspace of {\\\\mathcal{H}} of dimension at most 2n. The spin scalar product {\\\\prec} \\\\cdot  \\\\cdot {\\\\succ}_x defined by :{\\\\prec}u  v {\\\\succ}_x = -{\\\\langle}u  x v {\\\\rangle}_{\\\\mathcal{H}}\\\\qquad \\\\text{for all } u,v \\\\in S_x is an indefinite inner product on S_x of signature (p,q) with p,q \\\\leq n. A wave function \\\\psi is a mapping :\\\\psi {\\\\,}:{\\\\,}M \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathcal{H}}\\\\qquad \\\\text{with} \\\\qquad \\\\psi(x) \\\\in S_x \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } x \\\\in M{\\\\,}. On wave functions for which the norm {\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!}\\\\cdot {\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!} defined by :{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!}\\\\psi {\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!}^2 = \\\\int_M \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\psi(x) \\\\bigg\\\\, x\\\\, \\\\psi(x) \\\\right\\\\rangle_{\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\,}d\\\\rho(x) is finite (where x= \\\\sqrt{x^2} is the absolute value of the symmetric operator x), one can define the inner product :{\\\\mathopen{<}}\\\\psi  \\\\phi {\\\\mathclose{>}}= \\\\int_M {\\\\prec}\\\\psi(x)  \\\\phi(x) {\\\\succ}_x {\\\\,}d\\\\rho(x) {\\\\,}. Together with the topology induced by the norm {\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!}\\\\cdot {\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!}, one obtains a Krein space ({{\\\\mathcal{K}}}, {\\\\mathopen{<}}\\\\cdot\\\\cdot {\\\\mathclose{>}}). To any vector u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H} we can associate the wave function :\\\\psi^u(x) := \\\\pi_x u (where \\\\pi_x : \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\rightarrow S_x is again the orthogonal projection to the spin space). This gives rise to a distinguished family of wave functions, referred to as the wave functions of the occupied states. = The fermionic projector = The kernel of the fermionic projector P(x,y) is defined by :P(x,y) = \\\\pi_x \\\\,y_{S_y} {\\\\,}:{\\\\,}S_y \\\\rightarrow S_x (where \\\\pi_x : \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\rightarrow S_x is again the orthogonal projection on the spin space, and _{S_y} denotes the restriction to S_y). The fermionic projector P is the operator :P {\\\\,}:{\\\\,}{{\\\\mathcal{K}}}\\\\rightarrow {{\\\\mathcal{K}}}{\\\\,},\\\\qquad (P \\\\psi)(x) = \\\\int_M P(x,y)\\\\, \\\\psi(y)\\\\, d\\\\rho(y){\\\\,}, which has the dense domain of definition given by all vectors \\\\psi \\\\in {{\\\\mathcal{K}}} satisfying the conditions :\\\\phi := \\\\int_M x\\\\, \\\\psi(x)\\\\, d\\\\rho(x) {\\\\,}\\\\in {\\\\,}{\\\\mathcal{H}}\\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad {\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!}\\\\phi {\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!}< \\\\infty{\\\\,}. As a consequence of the causal action principle, the kernel of the fermionic projector has additional normalization properties which justify the name projector. = Connection and curvature = Being an operator from one spin space to another, the kernel of the fermionic projector gives relations between different spacetime points. This fact can be used to introduce a spin connection :D_{x,y} \\\\,:\\\\, S_y \\\\rightarrow S_x \\\\quad \\\\text{unitary}\\\\,. The basic idea is to take a polar decomposition of P(x,y). The construction becomes more involved by the fact that the spin connection should induce a corresponding metric connection : abla_{x,y}\\\\,:\\\\, T_y \\\\rightarrow T_x \\\\quad \\\\text{isometric}\\\\,, where the tangent space T_x is a specific subspace of the linear operators on S_x endowed with a Lorentzian metric. The spin curvature is defined as the holonomy of the spin connection, :\\\\mathfrak{R}(x,y,z) = D_{x,y} \\\\,D_{y,z} \\\\,D_{z,x} \\\\,:\\\\, S_x \\\\rightarrow S_x\\\\,. Similarly, the metric connection gives rise to metric curvature. These geometric structures give rise to a proposal for a quantum geometry. = The Euler-Lagrange equations and the linearized field equations = A minimizer \\\\rho of the causal action satisfies corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. They state that the function \\\\ell_\\\\kappa defined by : \\\\ell_\\\\kappa(x) := \\\\int_M \\\\big( {\\\\mathcal{L}}_\\\\kappa(x,y) + \\\\kappa\\\\, xy^2 \\\\big) \\\\, d\\\\rho(y) \\\\,-\\\\, \\\\mathfrak{s} (with two Lagrange parameters \\\\kappa and \\\\mathfrak{s}) vanishes and is minimal on the support of \\\\rho, :\\\\ell_\\\\kappa_M \\\\equiv \\\\inf_{x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}} \\\\ell_\\\\kappa(x) = 0 \\\\,. For the analysis, it is convenient to introduce jets {\\\\mathfrak{u}} := (a, u) consisting of a real-valued function a$a$ on M and a vector field u on T\\\\mathcal{F} along M, and to denote the combination of multiplication and directional derivative by abla_{\\\\mathfrak{u}} g(x) := a(x)\\\\, g(x) + \\\\big(D_u g \\\\big)(x). Then the Euler-Lagrange equations imply that the weak Euler-Lagrange equations : abla_{\\\\mathfrak{u}} \\\\ell_M = 0 hold for any test jet \\\\mathfrak{u}. Families of solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations are generated infinitesimally by a jet {\\\\mathfrak{v}} which satisfies the linearized field equations :\\\\langle \\\\mathfrak{u}, \\\\Delta \\\\mathfrak{v} \\\\rangle_M = 0 \\\\, , to be satisfied for all test jets \\\\mathfrak{u}, where the Laplacian $\\\\Delta$ is defined by : \\\\langle \\\\mathfrak{u}, \\\\Delta \\\\mathfrak{v} \\\\rangle(x) := abla_{\\\\mathfrak{u}} \\\\bigg( \\\\int_M \\\\big( abla_{1, \\\\mathfrak{v}} + abla_{2, \\\\mathfrak{v}} \\\\big) \\\\mathcal{L}(x,y)\\\\, d\\\\rho(y) - abla_\\\\mathfrak{v} \\\\mathfrak{s} \\\\bigg) \\\\,. The Euler-Lagrange equations describe the dynamics of the causal fermion system, whereas small perturbations of the system are described by the linearized field equations. = Conserved surface layer integrals = In the setting of causal fermion systems, spatial integrals are expressed by so-called surface layer integrals. In general terms, a surface layer integral is a double integral of the form : \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\bigg( \\\\int_{M \\\\setminus \\\\Omega} \\\\cdots {\\\\mathcal{L}}(x,y) \\\\, d\\\\rho(y) \\\\bigg) \\\\, d\\\\rho(x) \\\\, , where one variable is integrated over a subset \\\\Omega \\\\subset M, and the other variable is integrated over the complement of \\\\Omega. It is possible to express the usual conservation laws for charge, energy, ... in terms of surface layer integrals. The corresponding conservation laws are a consequence of the Euler-Lagrange equations of the causal action principle and the linearized field equations. For the applications, the most important surface layer integrals are the current integral \\\\gamma^\\\\Omega_\\\\rho(\\\\mathfrak{v}), the symplectic form \\\\sigma^\\\\Omega_\\\\rho(\\\\mathfrak{u}, \\\\mathfrak{v}), the surface layer inner product \\\\langle \\\\mathfrak{u}, \\\\mathfrak{v}\\\\rangle^\\\\Omega_\\\\rho and the nonlinear surface layer integral \\\\gamma^\\\\Omega(\\\\tilde{\\\\rho}, \\\\rho). = Bosonic Fock space dynamics = Based on the conservation laws for the above surface layer integrals, the dynamics of a causal fermion system as described by the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to the causal action principle can be rewritten as a linear, norm-preserving dynamics on the bosonic Fock space built up of solutions of the linearized field equations. In the so- called holomorphic approximation, the time evolution respects the complex structure, giving rise to a unitary time evolution on the bosonic Fock space. = A fermionic Fock state = If {\\\\mathcal{H}} has finite dimension f, choosing an orthonormal basis u_1, \\\\ldots, u_f of {\\\\mathcal{H}} and taking the wedge product of the corresponding wave functions : \\\\big( \\\\psi^{u_1} \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge \\\\psi^{u_f} \\\\big)(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_f) gives a state of an f-particle fermionic Fock space. Due to the total anti-symmetrization, this state depends on the choice of the basis of {\\\\mathcal{H}} only by a phase factor. This correspondence explains why the vectors in the particle space are to be interpreted as fermions. It also motivates the name causal fermion system.  Underlying physical principles  Causal fermion systems incorporate several physical principles in a specific way: * A local gauge principle: In order to represent the wave functions in components, one chooses bases of the spin spaces. Denoting the signature of the spin scalar product at x by ({\\\\mathfrak{p}}_x, {\\\\mathfrak{q}}_x), a pseudo-orthonormal basis (\\\\mathfrak{e}_\\\\alpha(x))_{\\\\alpha=1,\\\\ldots, {\\\\mathfrak{p}}_x+{\\\\mathfrak{q}}_x} of S_x is given by ::{\\\\prec}\\\\mathfrak{e}_\\\\alpha  \\\\mathfrak{e}_\\\\beta {\\\\succ}= s_\\\\alpha{\\\\,}\\\\delta_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\quad \\\\text{with} \\\\quad s_1, \\\\ldots, s_{{\\\\mathfrak{p}}_x} = 1,\\\\;\\\\; s_{{\\\\mathfrak{p}}_x+1}, \\\\ldots, s_{{\\\\mathfrak{p}}_x+{\\\\mathfrak{q}}_x} =-1 {\\\\,}. :Then a wave function \\\\psi can be represented with component functions, ::\\\\psi(x) = \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^{{\\\\mathfrak{p}}_x+{\\\\mathfrak{q}}_x} \\\\psi^\\\\alpha(x){\\\\,}\\\\mathfrak{e}_\\\\alpha(x) {\\\\,}. :The freedom of choosing the bases (\\\\mathfrak{e}_\\\\alpha(x)) independently at every spacetime point corresponds to local unitary transformations of the wave functions, ::\\\\psi^\\\\alpha(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\sum_{\\\\beta=1}^{{\\\\mathfrak{p}}_x+{\\\\mathfrak{q}}_x} U(x)^\\\\alpha_\\\\beta \\\\,\\\\, \\\\psi^\\\\beta(x) \\\\quad \\\\text{with} \\\\quad U(x)\\\\in \\\\text{U}({\\\\mathfrak{p}}_x, {\\\\mathfrak{q}}_x) {\\\\,}. :These transformations have the interpretation as local gauge transformations. The gauge group is determined to be the isometry group of the spin scalar product. The causal action is gauge invariant in the sense that it does not depend on the choice of spinor bases. * The equivalence principle: For an explicit description of spacetime one must work with local coordinates. The freedom in choosing such coordinates generalizes the freedom in choosing general reference frames in a spacetime manifold. Therefore, the equivalence principle of general relativity is respected. The causal action is generally covariant in the sense that it does not depend on the choice of coordinates. * The Pauli exclusion principle: The fermionic Fock state associated to the causal fermion system makes it possible to describe the many-particle state by a totally antisymmetric wave function. This gives agreement with the Pauli exclusion principle. * The principle of causality is incorporated by the form of the causal action in the sense that spacetime points with spacelike separation do not interact.  Limiting cases  Causal fermion systems have mathematically sound limiting cases that give a connection to conventional physical structures. = Lorentzian spin geometry of globally hyperbolic spacetimes = Starting on any globally hyperbolic Lorentzian spin manifold (\\\\hat{M}, g) with spinor bundle S\\\\hat{M}, one gets into the framework of causal fermion systems by choosing ({\\\\mathcal{H}}, {\\\\langle}.. {\\\\rangle}_{\\\\mathcal{H}}) as a subspace of the solution space of the Dirac equation. Defining the so-called local correlation operator F(p) for p \\\\in \\\\hat{M} by :{\\\\langle}\\\\psi  F(p) \\\\phi {\\\\rangle}_{\\\\mathcal{H}} = -{\\\\prec}\\\\psi  \\\\phi {\\\\succ}_p (where {\\\\prec}\\\\psi  \\\\phi {\\\\succ}_p is the inner product on the fibre S_p \\\\hat{M}) and introducing the universal measure as the push-forward of the volume measure on \\\\hat{M}, :\\\\rho = F_* d\\\\mu {\\\\,}, one obtains a causal fermion system. For the local correlation operators to be well-defined, {\\\\mathcal{H}} must consist of continuous sections, typically making it necessary to introduce a regularization on the microscopic scale \\\\varepsilon. In the limit \\\\varepsilon \\\\searrow 0, all the intrinsic structures on the causal fermion system (like the causal structure, connection and curvature) go over to the corresponding structures on the Lorentzian spin manifold. Thus the geometry of spacetime is encoded completely in the corresponding causal fermion systems. = Quantum mechanics and classical field equations = The Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to the causal action principle have a well-defined limit if the spacetimes M:=\\\\text{supp}\\\\, \\\\rho of the causal fermion systems go over to Minkowski space. More specifically, one considers a sequence of causal fermion systems (for example with {\\\\mathcal{H}} finite-dimensional in order to ensure the existence of the fermionick Fock state as well as of minimizers of the causal action), such that the corresponding wave functions go over to a configuration of interacting Dirac seas involving additional particle states or \\"holes\\" in the seas. This procedure, referred to as the continuum limit, gives effective equations having the structure of the Dirac equation coupled to classical field equations. For example, for a simplified model involving three elementary fermionic particles in spin dimension two, one obtains an interaction via a classical axial gauge field A described by the coupled Dirac- and Yang-Mills equations :\\\\begin{align} (i \\\\partial \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/\\\\ + \\\\gamma^5 A \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/\\\\ - m) \\\\psi &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_0 (\\\\partial^k_j A^j - \\\\Box A^k) - C_2 A^k &= 12 \\\\pi^2 \\\\bar \\\\psi \\\\gamma^5 \\\\gamma^k \\\\psi \\\\,. \\\\end{align} Taking the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation, one obtains the Pauli equation or the Schr√∂dinger equation, giving the correspondence to quantum mechanics. Here C_0 and C_2 depend on the regularization and determine the coupling constant as well as the rest mass. Likewise, for a system involving neutrinos in spin dimension 4, one gets effectively a massive SU(2) gauge field coupled to the left-handed component of the Dirac spinors. The fermion configuration of the standard model can be described in spin dimension 16. = The Einstein field equations = For the just-mentioned system involving neutrinos, the continuum limit also yields the Einstein field equations coupled to the Dirac spinors, :R_{jk} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,R\\\\, g_{jk} + \\\\Lambda\\\\, g_{jk} = \\\\kappa\\\\, T_{jk}[\\\\Psi, A] \\\\,, up to corrections of higher order in the curvature tensor. Here the cosmological constant \\\\Lambda is undetermined, and T_{jk} denotes the energy-momentum tensor of the spinors and the SU(2) gauge field. The gravitation constant \\\\kappa depends on the regularization length. = Quantum field theory in Minkowski space = Starting from the coupled system of equations obtained in the continuum limit and expanding in powers of the coupling constant, one obtains integrals which correspond to Feynman diagrams on the tree level. Fermionic loop diagrams arise due to the interaction with the sea states, whereas bosonic loop diagrams appear when taking averages over the microscopic (in generally non-smooth) spacetime structure of a causal fermion system (so-called microscopic mixing). The detailed analysis and comparison with standard quantum field theory is work in progress.

He was a popular but controversial public figure who was accused, with good reason, of leading an abortive revolt against the English Crown in 1603. He was tried for treason but acquitted. Soon afterwards he fled from Ireland and died in exile in Italy. Early life The Meade family, who were originally called Meagh or Miagh, had by the late sixteenth century become one of the most influential families in the city of Cork,MacLysaght, Edward The Surnames of Ireland Irish University Press 1973 p.211 and were prominent in both law and politics. John Meade, an earlier Recorder of Cork, was the ancestor of the Meade Baronets; William apparently belonged to another branch of the same family, although little is known of his own parents. William was first heard of in London studying law at the Middle Temple in 1580. His open adherence to the Roman Catholic faith, at a time when religious tensions between England and the Catholic powers, in particular France and Spain, were rising, brought him to the attention of the authorities. Together with a number of other Irish students, he was arrested and interrogated, and his chambers were searched for seditious materials.Kenny, Colum King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Dublin Irish Academic Press 1992 pp.51‚Äì2 This caused something of a panic among other Irish law students in London: those of them like Meade himself who inclined to the Roman Catholic faith felt it prudent to absent themselves from their studies for a time.Kenny p.51 Presumably William was able to convince the English Crown of his loyalty, since he was called to the Bar and returned to practice in Cork. When he was elected Recorder of Cork he must, to have qualified for the office, have sworn the obligatory oath acknowledging Elizabeth I as Head of the Church of Ireland. Rebellion On the Queen's death in March 1603, the throne of England passed smoothly and peacefully to her cousin James VI of Scotland. In Ireland by contrast there was considerable political unrest, especially in the southern towns. Some historians have referred to the revolt as a \\"foolish and unpremeditated\\" rising with no clear motive.Gibson, Rev. C. B. History of Cork London 1861 Vol. 2 p.10 This view is undoubtedly too harsh, since a religious motive at least can be discerned clearly enough. James, whose mother, Mary Queen of Scots, had been a Catholic, was generally believed to be more tolerant in matters of religion than Elizabeth, and the rebels apparently hoped that pressure could be brought on the Crown by a show of force to relax the Penal Laws. By contrast the English Catholic community, who waited patiently for similar reforms to be enacted, found their hopes dashed. According to the subsequent indictment at his trial for treason, Meade had proclaimed the supremacy of the Roman Catholic faith.Their hopes may have been based on the widespread belief that before he succeeded to the English throne James I in 1601 or 1602 had promised to repeal the Penal Laws in England, if not Ireland. Although James denied it, the consensus among historians is that some kind of promise was made- see Antonia Fraser The Gunpowder Plot- Treason and Faith in 1605 Weidenfeld & Nicolson London 1996 pp.37‚Äì8 The agitation was at its strongest in Cork, where it was led by Meade and the Mayor of Cork, Thomas Sarsfield. The leading families of Cork appear at first to have been evenly divided between supporters and opponents of the revolt.Windele, J. History of the City of Cork and its environs, Gougane Barra, Glengarriff and Killarney Revised edition Messrs Bolster Cork 1846 pp.7-8 When Sir George Thornton and Sir Gervase Wilmot arrived to proclaim the new King, Sarsfield and Meade refused to permit them to issue the proclamation.Pawlisch, Hans, ed. Sir John Davies and the Conquest of Ireland Cambridge University Press 1985 p.104 Sarsfield reportedly referred to the pretender Perkin Warbeck, whose attempt to seize the Crown in the 1490s had the backing of some of the Anglo-Irish nobility, and found his strongest support in Cork: the implication was presumably that the Irish could choose a different King from the English if they so wished. William Saxey, the Chief Justice of Munster, said that anyone who refused to proclaim the King deserved to be arrested. Meade retorted that no one present had the power of arrest. Rioting broke out, in which it was said that three Englishmen died. Wilmot and Thornton were expelled from the city, the gates were barred and Meade was accused of urging the citizens to demolish the recently built fort at Haulbowline.Crawford, Jon G. A Star Chamber Court in Ireland-the Court of Castle Chamber 1571‚Äì1641 Four Courts Press 2005 p.287 George Carew, Lord President of Munster, a bitter personal enemy of Meade. The Lord President of Munster, Sir George Carew, on being informed of the riot, sent troops to Cork to restore order: he had a personal interest in suppressing the disturbance since his own wife, fearing for her safety, had barricaded herself in Shandon Castle.A Brief Relation of the Late Rebellion in the City of Cork Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts preserved in the Library of Lambeth Palace ed. J.S. Brewer and W.Bullen 6 Vols. 1867-1873 Vol. V Document 5. A majority of the Cork city fathers were now opposed to any further resistance, and in defiance of Meade's orders they prudently opened the gates.Windele p.8 Meade and Sarsfield along with other ringleaders, including Lieutenant Christopher Morrogh, were arrested.Pawlisch p. 104 Aftermath In early May 1603 the Lord Deputy, Mountjoy, arrived to personally take charge of the situation. Carew, no doubt enraged by the threats against his wife, urged that all the Cork city fathers be put on trial for treason, but Mountjoy took a more conciliatory approach. He set up a military court to try the leading rebels: following a summary trial, Lieutenant Morrogh and two other ringleaders of the rebellion were hanged.Windele p.8 Sarsfield wisely made a full recantation of his misdeeds, and was pardoned by Mountjoy, as was his associate Thomas Fagan, a local churchwarden.Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts Meade was recalcitrant, maintaining that he had acted lawfully, and had not committed treason. As a result, he remained in prison while the authorities considered what to do with him. He was still in prison in Dublin in July, as the Crown \\"had much ado even to bring in an indictment against him for his treasons\\".Harrison, G.B. A Jacobean Journal, being a record of the things most talked about in the years 1603-1606 London Butler and Tanner 1941 In hindsight it was said that Mountjoy might as well have pardoned Meade along with Sarsfield and Fagan, since the Crown was well aware of his great popularity in Cork.Harrison Jacobean Journal Also, experience had taught them that whereas an English jury could be trusted to return a guilty verdict in a treason trial, an acquittal was a very real possibility in Ireland. The suggestion was made that he be tried in England, but eventually it was decided to try him at Youghal, presumably in the hope that he might be less well known and less popular there than in Cork city.Crawford p.287 Trial These hopes were illusory, although Mountjoy empanelled an impressively strong Bench to try Meade. It was headed by the Lord President of Munster, assisted by several senior judges, including William Saxey, the Chief Justice of Munster, (who had been an eyewitness to the riot) and Sir Nicholas Walsh, the Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. Since Walsh had narrowly escaped death during a similar disturbance in Waterford, it is arguable that he should have recused himself from sitting as a judge at Meade's trial, on the grounds of perceived judicial bias. Meade, who pleaded not guilty and insisted that he had never disputed the new King's authority, challenged all jurors of English birth  the jury in the end comprised nine Protestants and three Catholics, all Irish. Great pressure was put on them to convict, and evidence was brought not only of the refusal to proclaim the King, and the attempt to proclaim the Roman Catholic faith, but also of the attempted destruction of Haulbowline fort, and Meade's supposed complicity in the deaths of three men during the riot. Fynes Moryson, secretary to the Lord Deputy of Ireland, later wrote drily that no one who knew anything about Ireland believed that any Irish jury would condemn Meade.Pawlisch p.104 Nor did they do so, maintaining that they knew that \\"he had not intended treason in his heart\\". For presuming to bring in this verdict in open defiance of the Government's clearly expressed wishes, they felt the full weight of official anger. They were prosecuted in the Court of Castle Chamber, heavily fined, and ordered to stand outside Cork Courthouse holding papers proclaiming their offence.Crawford p.162 Later life Meade, who was \\"not one to press his luck\\"Pawlisch p.104 left Ireland for good shortly after his acquittal and eventually settled in Italy. He justified the Crown's suspicions about his loyalty by accepting a pension from Philip III of Spain. He continued to agitate for the repeal of the Penal Laws, and published an influential tract, Advice to the Catholics of Munster in 1611, in which he argued that the laws in question had lapsed on the death of Elizabeth I.Gibson p.17 In the same year he was sent to Rome in a fruitless attempt to persuade Hugh O'Neill to return to Ireland. He died in Naples; the precise date of his death is unknown.Crawford p.287 References People from Cork (city) Members of the Middle Temple People acquitted of treason People of Elizabethan Ireland Recorders of Cork ","title":"William Meade (Irish judge)"},{"id":"42944277","text":"Capua spilonoma is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

It is an active Roman Catholic parish church in the diocese of Lancaster. The church was designed by A. W. N. Pugin, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History In 1809 the first Roman Catholic chapel was built in Kirkham. It was dedicated to the Holy Cross, and was known as \\"The Willows\\" because it was in an area surrounded by willow trees. This name is still associated with the present church. The chapel was replaced by the present church, which was built between 1842 and 1845 and was designed by A. W. N. Pugin. Said to have cost ¬£10,000 (), the church was designed to hold 500‚Äì600 people and was heated by underfloor hot air provided by a furnace. The only lighting, however, was by hand-held candles. The church was consecrated on 22 April 1845 by Rt Revd George Brown, the bishop of Liverpool. The ceremony lasted from 7am until noon, after which the Bishop said Mass. The following day, St George's Day, the formal opening took place with four bishops in attendance and a host of other clergy. A special train was provided from Preston to bring about 200 guests. After a grand procession from the old chapel, the terce was sung by the priests and a choir from St. Augustine's, Preston then sang a High Mass with music from Mozart and Haydn. The sermon was by Scottish Bishop Murdock followed by a Te Deum. Afterwards there was a meal, with toasts and speeches. From 1895 the parish priest was Fr Francis John Gillow and in 1895-6 a number of alterations were made by him to the interior of the church.Pugin Foundation: English buildings, Lancashire retrieved 1 July 2014 The floor was lowered by about and the steps at the west entrance were removed. At the same time Pugin's altar was moved to a side chapel and the rood screen was relocated to the west end of the church and altered to fit.Singleton, F. J. (1983), Mowbreck Hall and The Willows: A History of The Catholic Community in the Kirkham District of Lancashire, The Parish Priest, St. John the Evangelist, Kirkham, pp.33‚Äì36 In 1906 Gillow installed a new main altar, a pulpit, benches, and Stations of the Cross. In 2011 the parish was linked with that of St Joseph, Wesham, and in 2013 the two joined to become the Parish of the Holy Cross. In the 1930s the church social club had its own successful snooker team which won a couple of trophies. The church website maintains links to a number of documents of historical interest. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in sandstone from Longridge, and has slate roofs. It is in early Decorated style. It has a five-bay nave with a clerestory and aisles, a south porch, a chancel also with aisles, and a sanctuary without aisles. To the northeast is a vestry block, and at the west end a steeple. The tower has angle buttresses and a stair tower at the southeast corner. There is a moulded west doorway, above which is a two-light window, and a small window to the ringers' chamber. The bell openings have two openings, and above them is a continuous hood mould around the whole tower. On the tower is a broach spire with three tiers of lucarnes and a coronet of blind lucarnes. The spire rises to . The gables at the east ends of the nave and the sanctuary have cross finials. Along the sides of the clerestory are five quatrefoil windows with hood moulds. Most of the windows along the aisles have two lights, and the east window has three lights. =Interior= Inside the church the five-bay arcade is carried on round piers with tall plinths. There is an organ gallery at the west end. The Lady chapel is at the southeast of the church, and the Sacred Heart Chapel is at the northeast. A few items of church furniture designed by Pugin are still in use, including a triple sedilia, credence table, prie-dieu and candlesticks. Pugin's rood screen was moved to the west end in 1895-6. It is in Caen stone, painted brown, and has a wide central ogee arch flanked by three similar but smaller arches on each side. The painted rood figures, representing the Crucifixion, and also by Pugin, hang on the chancel arch. Pugin's altar has been moved into the Sacred Heart chapel, and has been altered. The other fittings date from the 1906 refurbishment. These include the high altar, in Carrara marble and alabaster, and the elaborate pulpit, also in marble and alabaster. Around the church is a colourful scheme of stained glass windows, dating from the mid-19th century or later. The two-manual pipe organ was built in 1846 by J. C. Bishop of London, and was repaired in 1976 by the Pendlebury Organ Company of Cleveleys. =Bells= There is a ring of six bells, all cast in 1844 by Charles and George Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. They have been described as the first peal of bells to have been rung in an English Catholic church since the Reformation. External features The churchyard walls and the gateway were also designed by Pugin, and are built in the same stone as the church. The wall runs along Ribby Road and has copings with the appearance of a Mansard roof. The gateway is in the form of an arch. Its top is stepped and has coping similar to that on the wall. The arch is pointed and chamfered, and behind it are buttresses. Appraisal The church along with the churchyard walls and gateway were designated as Grade II listed buildings on 11 June 1986. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\". The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in 1969, says of the church and its architect: \\"It is a modest building and, like so much of Pugin's, really very impersonal\\".
