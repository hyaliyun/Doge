The division was formed on March 6, 1915, from units taken from other divisions or newly raised. The division was initially mixed, with two infantry regiments from the Grand Duchy of Baden, one infantry regiment from Prussian Saxony, and Prussian and Baden support units (cavalry, artillery, engineers, and service and support units). While the infantry regiments and the divisional cavalry squadron were regular army units, the rest of the division was made up of reserve units and units formed during the war. The 66th Magdeburg Infantry Regiment was taken from the 7th Infantry Division, and the 169th and 170th Infantry Regiments were taken from Baden's 29th Infantry Division.

The company was established the 11 February 1891 with a capital stock of about 5 million dollars obtained from financiers from Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Isaacman and Isaacman report that the firm was capitalised at 40,000 pounds, and that British and French capital quickly predominated. Allen Isaacman and Barbara Isaacman, Mozambique: From Colonialism to Revolution, 1900-1982. 1983, Boulder, Colorado, USA., Westview. p.36. The concession was granted for a period of 50 years, during which the company could not only exploit the resources and existing manpower (partly through the chibalo system of forced labour) but also grant subconcessions. The company was granted the exclusive right to collect taxes, but was itself granted a 25-year tax exemption. In return the Portuguese state would receive 7.5% of the company's profits and 10% of the sold shares. The company was also required to settle 1,000 Portuguese families and provide education and public administration in its territory. In practice, the company made only partial use of the prerogatives with which it had been bestowed; but this was balanced by the fact that it also met very few of its obligations. Having only limited capital, the company did little to develop the area, deriving most of its income from its ability to tax and its power to use conscripted labour on its plantations and for lease to adjacent estates. Resistance to the forced labour regime was a major cause of rebellions against the company which occurred in 1902 and 1917. Despite the company's obligation under its charter to provide forces to maintain law and order, it was unable to meet these crises, and on both occasions Portugal had to mount expensive interventions. The Mozambique Company had its headquarters in Beira, where it controlled the public administration and the post offices. The company also founded a private bank, the Banco da Beira, which issued currency in pounds. Because of its bad performance and because of the shift, under the Salazar regime, towards Portuguese control and away from international control of the economy, the company's concession was not renewed when it ran out in 1942. The Governor of Manica and Sofala commented: > They did nothing to develop the potential wealth of this entire region, > preferring to plunder it and alienate the natives.

On 18 July 1942, the territory of Manica and Sofala passed to the Portuguese colonial authorities and the Mozambique Company continued to operate in the agricultural and commercial sectors. On 20 October 1961, The Mozambique Company became the Grupo Entreposto Comercial de Mo√ßambique, which transformed itself into a holding on 6 September 1972, with the participation of capital from other companies, including Entreposto-Gest√£o e Participa√ß√µes (SGPS) SA. In 1939 the President of Portugal awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Colonial Empire to the company, the first time it had been awarded to a company.

After his novitiate, he studied philosophy at the Coll√®ge at La Fl√®che where he was a student of √ânemond Mass√©, a Jesuit missionary newly returned from New France. Father Vimont first arrived in North America as part of a flotilla of four ships and a bark commanded by Charles Daniel in August 1629. Caught in a storm off the Newfoundland Banks, the ships were scattered with one ship carrying Vimont and the Captain making it to Cape Breton Island. Fort Sainte Anne was established and Vimont began his missionary work but was recalled to France the following year. In 1639, Father Vimont returned to the New World, this time to Quebec to become third superior of the Jesuit Mission in Canada, succeeding Father Paul Le Jeune. He functioned in that capacity in New France until 1645. Vimont, a friend and admirer of Jean Nicolet, wrote the only contemporary account of Nicolet's 1634 voyage to the interior of North America (published in Paris in 1642). He had also arrived in New France with Marie-Madeline de Chauvigny de la Peltrie who was the secular foundress of the Ursulines of Quebec and Marie de l'Incarnation who was the Ursuline foundress.

It is based on Japanese manga and the Super Sentai series. It started off as a parody, then developed more serious storylines that still included comedy. It features five main rangers (red, blue, green, pink and yellow) as well as an extra white one. They are led by O Poderoso Combo (The Mighty Combo, whom the Rangers call Tio Combo, or Uncle Combo in English), and fight against several forms of evil. Combo Rangers has won the HQ Mix Award three times.  Synopsis  The story is set in a fictional city called Cidade City (\\"City City\\") which is located in a fictional universe called \\"Yabuverso\\" (\\"Yabuverse\\"). Initially, Poderoso Combo was responsible for saving the city and the world from all kinds of evil, but his powers were harming his health and he was forced to retire. Therefore, he recruited five kids, all about nine years old, to battle against General Monte, a threat coming from space. The passage of time in the story matches time passing in the real world, so as the story advances, all the characters grew up. In the last season, they were featured as teenagers. Beyond being superheroes, they also had to balance school, home, and family, while trying to keep their superhero lives a secret. They are also members of ASH, the Association of Super Heroes (Associa√ß√£o de Super-Her√≥is) which is home to several other superheroes. Development The series was featured online until 2003, when it was cancelled. It was also printed as comics. There was a 3-issue miniseries printed by Editora JBC in 2000,http://www.universohq.com/reviews/combo-rangers-revolution-3/ a 12-issue series printed by the same company, and a 10-issue series printed by Panini Comics. In 2004, Yabu decided to stop writing the comic, in order to focus solely on his book \\"Princesas do Mar\\" (Sea Princesses). The book has been a success and Yabu has since released two sequels. In December 2012, Yabu ran a crowdfunding project on the website to release a new Combo Rangers story as a graphic novel.http://catarse.me/pt/comborangers The funding was successful and the book was released in Brazil in 2013.Naranjo, Marcelo.

Siegel serves as the Founding Editor for the Norton Professional Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology which contains over sixty textbooks. The Mindful Brain: Reflection and Attunement in the Cultivation of Well-Being (2007) explores the nature of mindful awareness as a process that harnesses the social circuitry of the brain as it promotes mental, physical, and relational health. The Mindful Therapist: A Clinician's Guide to Mindsight and Neural Integration (2010), explores the application of focusing techniques for the clinician's own development, as well as their clients' development of mindsight and neural integration. Pocket Guide to Interpersonal Neurobiology: An Integrative Handbook of the Mind (2012), explores how to apply the interpersonal neurobiology approach to developing a healthy mind, an integrated brain, and empathic relationships. Mind: A Journey to the Heart of Being Human (2016) offers a deep exploration of our mental lives as they emerge from the body and our relations to each other and the world around us. His upcoming book Aware: The Science and Practice of Presence (2018) will provide practical instruction for mastering the Wheel of Awareness, a tool for cultivating more focus, presence, and peace in one's day-to-day life. Siegel's publications for professionals and the public have been translated into over 40 languages.

Siegel is involved in mindfulness and developed the field of Interpersonal Neurobiology, which is an interdisciplinary view of life experience that draws on over a dozen branches of science to create a framework for understanding of our subjective and interpersonal lives.Source - The Developing Mind (Siegel 1999). Siegel's most recent work integrates the theories of Interpersonal Neurobiology with the theories of Mindfulness Practice and proposes that mindfulness practice is a highly developed process of both inter and intra personal attunement. He counsels comedian Chelsea Handler, a relationship that Dan is particularly proud of.

Songs or other musical forms influenced by the concept of outer space have appeared in music throughout history, both in instrumental and vocal pieces with lyrics. As early as Ancient Greece, Pythagoras believed in something called the \\"harmony of the spheres\\". He believed that since planets and the stars all moved in the universe according to mathematical equations that these mathematical equations could be translated into musical notes and thus produce a symphony. This idea was explored further throughout Western history under the theories of Musica universalis. Some more recent and widely different examples are The Planets by Gustav Holst, and the song \\"Space Oddity\\" by David Bowie. Outer space also appears as a theme in \\"space age\\" retro pop music, such as Stereolab's Space- Age Bachelor Pad Music. Music about outer space attracts enthusiastic listeners from all walks of life. Some have created web pages to share their interests. NASA, JPL, and the US Governmental Centennial of Flight Commission even have a webpages showcasing and discussing music about outer space.http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/dec/HQ_03396_Labelle.html ASA Song Soars To Grammy Nomination \\"Sounds\\" of Outer Space Near Jupiter Now Online ‚Äì JPL/NASA websitehttp://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Social/music/SH16.htm Aviation and Space Music ‚Äì U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission One useful example of such a web-based list is by astronomer Andrew Fraknoi; see under External Links, below, \\"A Catalog of Music Inspired by Serious Astronomy.\\" Music about outer space In 1958, Karl-Birger Blomdahl composed an opera Aniara to a libretto by Erik Lindegren based on the poem Aniara by Harry Martinson, a tragedy set aboard a space ship. In 1958, Russ Garcia recorded an exotica album called Fantastica on Capitol Records that was about space travel. In 1969, The Beatles released single Across the Universe. In 1972, Elton John released single Rocket Man. The same year, Tangerine Dream released their double album Zeit, featuring space-related track titles such as Birth of Liquid Plejades and Nebulous Dawn, as well as cover art depicting a solar eclipse. It is considered one of the first (possibly the first) Dark ambient albums. Eduard Artemyev has made space-themed music, for example for a space film Solaris (1972), although his best known and successfully covered space- themed sounding piece might be the theme song for non-space film Siberiade (1979). The Japanese musician Isao Tomita has produced many albums with space- based themes, such as The Planets (1976), his version of Holst's suite; Kosmos (1978); Bermuda Triangle (1979); Dawn Chorus (Canon of the Three Stars) (1984); Space Walk ‚Äì Impressions Of An Astronaut (compilation, 1984); Mind of the Universe ‚Äì Live at Linz (1985); Back to the Earth ‚Äì Live in New York (1988); and Nasca Fantasy (supporting Kodo, 1994). The Vangelis album Albedo 0.39 (1976) is entirely devoted to space, while a segment of Heaven and Hell (1975) was used as the theme to the PBS television series Cosmos by Carl Sagan. His work Mythodea: Music for NASA's Mars Odyssey Mission is reflective of his interest in space exploration. NASA Spotlight on Vangelis music for Mars Odyssey Mission Mike Oldfield's 1994 album The Songs of Distant Earth was based on Arthur C. Clarke's SF novel Songs of Distant Earth.

To Our Children's Children's Children by The Moody Blues was a 1969 album inspired by spaceflight. Several albums have featured music inspired by the Apollo space program. In 1983, Brian Eno with his brother Roger Eno and producer/recording artist Daniel Lanois, composed the score for the film For All Mankind, a documentary of NASA's Apollo program; an album of the music, Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks, was later released. On The Orb's 1991 two-disc debut album, Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, disc one of features an ambient musical simulation of the Apollo 11 moon journey, including excerpts of NASA recordings of the radio conversations between Mission Control and the astronauts in space. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, Julianne Regan and Tim Bricheno of All About Eve, released a video and song called Pale Blue Earth. The filk anthology albums Minus Ten and Counting (1983) and To Touch the Stars (2003) celebrate and promote the exploration of outer space.

The space music gradually drifts towards a return to the movement's opening gesture ... \\"); and in the manner of its composition, relating that Haydn conceived The Creation after discussing music and astronomy with William Herschel, oboist and astronomer (discoverer of the planet Uranus). In 2016, Avenged Sevenfold released their album, The Stage, a concept album about space, the universe, the human race, and artificial intelligence. The song \\"Exist\\" contains a spoken word section written and performed by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. Another band to use space as musical inspiration is the Christian \\"Astro-Rock\\" group Brave Saint Saturn, whose three albums, So Far from Home, The Light of Things Hoped For, and Anti-Meridian, form a trilogy that chronicles the journey of the fictional spaceship, the USS Gloria, on a trip to survey the moons of Saturn. The music uses space narratives, lingo, samples and quotes to portray the journey. Soundtracks for movies and TV shows about outer space An Etherwave-Theremin, assembled from Robert Moog's kit: the loop antenna on the left controls the volume while the upright antenna controls the pitch Soundtracks of science fiction movies and television and radio series often feature music associated with outer space, such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Red Dwarf, The X-Files, and others. The theremin is an electronic musical instrument associated with a very eerie sound, which has led to its use in movie soundtracks such as those in The Day the Earth Stood Still. Music played in planetariums and observatories Many forms of music are used Observatory and Planetarium shows, particularly genres such as Electronic music, classical music, Space music, and Space rock. Enthusiast's website with detailed information about music for Planetariums and generally about outer space Some artists, such as Geodesium, specialize in creating custom music for Planetariums. During the 1970s, IMAX's OMNIMAX (now IMAX Dome) film system was conceived to operate on planetarium screens. More recently, some planetariums have re-branded themselves as \\"dome theaters,\\" with broader offerings including wide-screen or \\"wraparound\\" films, fulldome video, and laser shows that combine music with laser-drawn patterns.

He was a member of the California State Assembly district 28 from 2000 to 2006. His district included all of Salinas and Watsonville. Before going to the Assembly, Salinas was a County Supervisor, a City Council Member, a community college instructor, and an elementary school teacher. Salinas is a Democrat. He left the assembly in 2006 because he was termed out. He surprised the political establishment by not challenging Republican incumbent Jeff Denham for the California State Senate district 12. Salinas returned to local politics and was elected to the Monterey County Board of Supervisors in 2006, representing District 3. Salinas has lived most of his life in the Salinas area, growing up around agribusiness. He has one son. Background =Family life= Salinas was born in Slayton, Texas‚Äîone of twelve children of migrant farmworkers. His family originates from the Mexican state of San Luis Potos√≠, where his mother attended school until the 3rd grade. His father had no formal education and originally came to the United States under the Bracero Program in the 1940s, living and working in Kansas. He returned to Mexico, married and years later returned with his wife and children to the United States in the 1950s, settling in Texas. This was the beginning of his experience as a farmworker over a 15-year period of fieldwork that included many migratory moves between the states of California and Texas, working in cotton and orange fields and whatever else was in season. Later, when Sim√≥n and his family picked up contract labor work, he picked strawberries in the central coast region of California at the age of 9. Due to the seasonal farmwork they followed, Sim√≥n moved constantly and never fully settled for long periods of time in one place. For his parents, this pattern continued on until their retirement in 1985. =Education= Simon Salinas finally settled permanently in the city of Watsonville, California at the age of 18, so that he could focus on his education. He graduated from Watsonville High School in 1974, and then went on to Claremont McKenna College to receive a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Latin American Studies in 1978. In 1981, Sim√≥n earned a Bilingual Teaching Credential from San Jose State University and in 1984 graduated with a J.D. from Santa Clara University Law School in California. =Teaching= Salinas credits his motivation in seeking a higher education to his parents, who instilled in him the motivation to succeed. He points to the example set by his father who, without any formal education, taught himself to read and write. It was this fact that encouraged Salinas to take advantage of the educational opportunities his parents were never given. Salinas was a bilingual 6th grade teacher at Bardin Elementary School in east Salinas. He became a professor at Hartnell College, in Salinas, from 1989 through 1993. Local politics Salinas began his public service career in June 1989 when he was elected as the first Mexican-American to serve on the Salinas City Council. During his tenure with the City of Salinas, Mr. Salinas served as Mayor Pro-Tem. Salinas was first elected to the Monterey County Board of Supervisors in 1993, representing District One, and was reelected in 1997. During his second term, he was elected Chair of the Board and was the first Mexican-American to serve on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors in over 100 years. State legislature In 2000, Salinas ran for the California state Assembly. After winning the Democratoc primary, he won an expensive, hard- fought general election against Republican Jeff Denham, who went on to be elected state Senator in 2002. Salinas was sworn in to represent the 28th District in the California State Assembly on December 4, 2000. He authored legislation addressing issues in affordable housing, agriculture, healthcare, public safety, transportation, local government, and education. For his legislative efforts on these and other issues, he was named \\"Legislator of the Year\\" by a few organizations that include Skills USA-VICA, California Transit Association, the League of California Cities, and the American Planning Association. In Salinas's first year in the Legislature, he sent 11 bills to the Governor and 9 were signed into law. Salinas served as the Chair of the Local Government Committee and as a Member of the Agriculture, Education, Health and Housing, Community Development Committees and other non-profit organization. He was Chair of the Select Committee on Rural Economic Development and vice president and co-founder of Caminos Del Arte, a non- profit organization that provides services for at-risk youth. As an assembly member, Salinas was a supporter of the 2006 bond measures. He was also a supporter of raising taxes, universal healthcare, improving social services, closing loopholes in Proposition 13, and independent redistricting. Return to local politics On January 9, 2007 Salinas once again took the oath of office to become a Monterey County Supervisor, this time representing the 3rd district.

The league was sanctioned by the Ontario Hockey Association and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and its clubs competed for the Allan Cup. History The league was founded in 1890 by the Ontario Hockey Association. At the top tier of Canadian Senior hockey, the league was eligible and often competed for the Allan Cup. In 1975, the OHA allowed Hockey Northwestern Ontario's Thunder Bay Twins, the defending Allan Cup champions to enter the league. In 1978, the league briefly changed its name to the Canadian International League, possibly to compete with Semi- Pro leagues which were rapidly gaining popularity. The league folded in 1979, when most of its teams vacated to the Continental Senior A Hockey League and Major Intermediate A Hockey League. Over the course of the last fifty seasons, the OHA Senior A Hockey League captured 16 Allan Cups in 26 appearances in the National final. If dated back to the beginning of the Allan Cup in 1908, the OHA had 24 champions in 38 appearances over the course of the league's history. The league's tradition was followed by the Continental Senior A Hockey League in 1979, which became the OHA Senior A Hockey League in 1980 and lasted until 1987. The torch was then passed to the Southwestern Senior A Hockey League in 1990, which today is known as Major League Hockey. The OHA Senior A Hockey League set the groundwork for much of the current Semi- Professional hockey market. The famous International Hockey League that lasted from 1945 until it merged with the American Hockey League in 2001, was founded in part by both the Windsor Bulldogs and Chatham Maroons. Both teams played at least two different stretches in the league. Also, the Sarnia Sailors spent a few seasons in the International Hockey League. As well, the Thunder Bay Twins jumped between Manitoba leagues and the different Ontario Hockey Association leagues until 1991 when the team changed their name to the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks and joined the Colonial Hockey League as a founding member. The team has since become the Rockford IceHogs of the United Hockey League. The Thunder Bay franchise won 3 Colonial Cups as CoHL champions and in Rockton they won 1 Colonial Cup as United Hockey League champions. In 2007, the UHL has changed its name and the ownership of the Rockford IceHogs has bought the old Cincinnati Mighty Ducks franchise, making the IceHogs a member of the American Hockey League for the 2007‚Äì08 season. =Allan Cups= Champions :1910: St. Michael's Majors defeated Queen's University and Sherbrooke in two games :1917: Toronto Dentals defeated Winnipeg Victorias 13-goals-to-12 :1918: Kitchener Greenshirts defeated Winnipeg Ypres 6-goals-to-4 :1919: Hamilton Tigers defeated Winnipeg Selkirk 7-goals-to-6 :1921: University of Toronto defeated Brandon 8-goals-to-3 :1922: Toronto Granites defeated Regina Victorias 13-goals-to-2 :1923: Toronto Granites defeated University of Saskatchewan 11-goals-to-2 :1927: University of Toronto defeated Fort William Thundering Herd 2-games-to-1 with 1 tie :1932: Toronto National Sea Fleas defeated Fort William Blues 2-games-to-none :1950: Toronto Marlboros defeated Calgary Stampeders 4-games-to-1 :1951: Owen Sound Mercurys defeated Fort Frances Canadians 4-games-to-3 :1953: Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen defeated Penticton Vees 4-games-to-1 :1955: Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen defeated Fort William Beavers 4-games-to-1 :1957: Whitby Dunlops defeated Spokane Flyers 4-games-to-none :1958: Belleville McFarlands defeated Kelowna Packers 4-games- to-3 :1959: Whitby Dunlops defeated Vernon Canadians 4-games-to-1 :1960: Chatham Maroons defeated Trail Smoke Eaters 4-games-to-none with 1 tie :1961: Galt Terriers defeated Winnipeg Maroons 4-games-to-1 :1963: Windsor Bulldogs defeated Winnipeg Maroons 4-games-to-1 :1969: Galt Hornets defeated Calgary Stampeders 4-games-to-none :1971: Galt Hornets defeated Calgary Stampeders 4-games-to-none :1973: Orillia Terriers defeated St. Boniface Mohawks 4-games- to-1 :1974: Barrie Flyers defeated Cranbrook Royals 4-games-to-2 :1977: Brantford Alexanders defeated Spokane Flyers 4-games-to-1 Finalists :1912: Winnipeg Victorias defeated Toronto Eatons 2-games-to-none :1920: Winnipeg Falcons defeated Toronto Granites 11-goals-to-5 :1925: Port Arthur Bearcats defeated University of Toronto 2-games-to-none :1926: Port Arthur Bearcats defeated University of Toronto 2-games-to-1 with 1 tie :1931: Winnipeg 'pegs defeated Hamilton Tigers 2-games-to-none :1946: Calgary Stampeders defeated Hamilton Tigers 4-games-to-1 :1952: Fort Frances Canadians defeated Stratford Indians 4-games-to-2 :1956: Vernon Canadians defeated Chatham Maroons 4-games- to-1 :1964: Winnipeg Maroons defeated Woodstock Athletics 4-games-to-none :1970: Spokane Jets defeated Orillia Terriers 4-games-to-2 :1972: Spokane Jets defeated Barrie Flyers 4-games-to-2 :1975: Thunder Bay Twins defeated Barrie Flyers 4-games-to-2 :1976: Spokane Flyers defeated Barrie Flyers 4-games-to- none :1978: Kimberley Dynamiters defeated Brantford Alexanders 4-games-to-1 =Olympic Winter Games= The winner of the Allan Cup was named the top \\"amateur\\" team in Canada, this made them eligible to compete in the Olympic Winter Games.

The church stands, not in the centre of the town, but in the elevated area of Overton overlooking the town. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Frodsham. History Domesday Book records the presence of a church with a priest in this position. In 1093 the tithes were given by Hugh Lupus to the abbot of St Werburgh's Abbey, Chester. In the 1270s they passed to the monastery of Vale Royal when it was founded by Edward I. Following the dissolution of the monasteries the tithes and advowson passed to the dean and chapter of Christ Church, Oxford. Frodsham is one of the ancient parishes of Cheshire and included the villages of Kingsley, Norley, Manley, Alvanley and Helsby. In the 19th century some of these villages formed separate parishes, Norley in 1836, Kingsley in 1851, Alvanley in 1861 and Helsby in 1875. The structure of the present church dates from around 1180. It is built from local red sandstone. In the 14th century the chancel was lengthened and the tower was built. In the following century the chancel was further lengthened and increased in height. In the 16th century the north chapel, and probably the south chapel, were added. Considerable rebuilding of the church was carried out by Bodley and Garner between 1880 and 1883. This included removing the galleries and plaster ceilings which had been inserted around 1740. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built of red sandstone. It has a symmetrical plan with a tower at the west end, a nave of 3¬Ω bays, north and south aisles, north and south two-bay chapels, and a three-bay chancel with a sanctuary. The north porch is dated 1715 and the south porch 1724. The tower is in three stages and has diagonal west and square east buttresses, a three- light west window, a clock on the north and south faces, two-light belfry windows and a crenellated parapet. The aisles and chancels are also crenellated. In the south wall of the tower have been re-set some Saxon and Norman carved stones. The north chapel is known as the Blessed Sacrament Chapel (it was formerly the Helsby Chapel) and the south chapel is known as the Lady Chapel (formerly the Kingsley Chapel). =Interior= The interior of the nave is considered to be one of the finest examples of Norman architecture in Cheshire. Although the arcades have been much restored, they still contain some Norman material. In the sanctuary is a piscina adapted from a 14th- century corbel and a sedilia. In the chancel are monuments, mainly to members of the Ashley family who lived in Park Place. The altar rails with twisted balusters date from the 17th century. The three-tier brass candelabra was made in Birmingham in 1805. The pulpit is Victorian and replaces an earlier three- decker pulpit. Hanging on the north wall of the nave is the sounding board from the old pulpit. Beside the pulpit is a memorial to Rev William Charles Cotton, vicar of Frodsham from 1857 to 1879. The font dated 1880 is by Bodley and Garner. The organ dates from 1882-3. The organ case is by John Oldrid Scott. The reredos in the north chapel dates from around 1700, and includes Corinthian columns and pilasters. The stained glass includes a window in the baptistry depicting the Good Shepherd, dated 1917, by Shrigley and Hunt, and three windows from the 1930s by A. K Nicholson. An altar table dated 1678 and the parish chest of 1679 were both made by Robert Harper. Most of the church plate was donated around 1760 by the vicar at that time, Rev. Francis Gastrell. The organ was built by Binns in 1882‚Äì83 and rebuilt by the same company in 1923. A further rebuild was carried out in 1982 by Sixsmith. There is a ring of eight bells, six of which were cast by Rudhall of Gloucester in 1734. The other two bells date from 1911 and are by John Taylor and Company. The parish registers begin in 1558, with a break between 1642 and 1661, and the churchwardens' accounts date from 1609. External features In the churchyard is a sundial dated 1790. It consists of a copper dial and gnomon on a sandstone stem standing on a base of three round steps. It is listed at Grade II. Also listed Grade II is a tomb to the memory of the Wright family dating from around 1806. It consists of a truncated obelisk on a panelled square plinth in grey stone. The churchyard also contains the war graves of 21 Commonwealth service personnel, 15 from World War I and six from World War II. Also in the churchyard is the grave of Prince Warabo, the teenaged son of King Jaja of Opobo, Nigeria, who was sent to the former Manor House School in Frodsham but died in 1882.

Wendler, who founded the local NSDAP group in Deggendorf in 1927, joined the Nazi Party (membership number 93,116) and the SA on July 1, 1928.Bogdan Musial: Deutsche Zivilverwaltung und Judenverfolgung im Generalgouvernement. Wiesbaden 1999, p. 398. In early April 1933, as a Sturmbannf√ºhrer with the SA, he joined the SS (membership number 36,050).Werner Pr√§g, Wolfgang Jacobmeyer (Hrsg.): Das Diensttagebuch des deutschen Generalgouverneurs in Polen 1939‚Äì1945. Stuttgart 1975, p. 955. He was appointed to the Bavarian Political Police by Himmler.Katrin Himmler (2007), The Himmler Brothers, Macmillan, London, 2008, p. 224 In April 1934, he rose to SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer, to SS- Standartenf√ºhrer in April 1935, and SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer in 1941. In early August 1941, he was promoted to Generalmajor der Polizei und SS-Brigadef√ºhrer. On 21 July 1943, he was appointed SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer und Generalleutnant der Polizei. On October 6, 1933, he was elected Lord Mayor of Hof.Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. Second revised edition. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2005, , p. 668. He was involved in the demolition of the Jewish Synagogue in Hof, during Kristallnacht in November 1938. Wendler resigned from the office of mayor in 1941. After the beginning of World War II, Wendler was the city commissioner in Kielce. In September 1939, he served as Stadtkommisasar in Kielce until he was made Stadthauptmann of Czƒôstochowa in December 1939. In 1940, he took over the same position in Radom, and in this capacity, ordered, among other things, the installation of a ghetto in Czƒôstochowa. From 31 January 1942 to 26 May 1943, he was the governor of the district of Krak√≥w. Thereafter, until 22 July 1944, he was governor of the Lublin district, after which he fled from the advancing Red Army. In May 1945, he fell into American captivity and went by the false name Kummermehr while there. For this reason, Wendler was not transferred to Poland, but rather released from Allied internment in September 1945. Afterwards, he worked as a construction worker. On 3 August 1948, he was arrested and imprisoned by a Denazification court. On 22 December 1948, as a \\"Hauptschuldige\\" (Group I ‚Äì Major Offender), he was sentenced to four years in a labor camp. In April 1949, the sentence was reduced to three years in prison. During the process, Wendler denied any knowledge of the deportations of Jews. On 12 September 1952, he was classified as \\"Belastete\\" (Group 2 ‚Äì Offender). He was classified as a \\"Mitl√§ufer\\" (Group 4 ‚Äì Follower) by pardon of Bavarian Minister-President Wilhelm Hoegner on 28 October 1955, and thereby was able to again obtain admission to the bar in Munich in 1955. The State Prosecutor in Munich stopped proceedings against Wendler on July 1, 1966, and further preliminary investigation ceased on October 5, 1970. He died in August 1972  Brief Role in Czƒôstochowa Ghetto  As city commissioner and SS- Brigadef√ºhrer, Wendler established the Czƒôstochowa Ghetto. The area chosen to house the ghetto was in the eastern and oldest portion of Czƒôstochowa. The ghetto was officially sealed off from the rest of Czƒôstochowa on August the 23rd, 1940. The initial population was that of 30,000 Jews, although the unseemly slum could hardly sustain a population a quarter of the size. Unlike other ghettos, the Czƒôstochowa Ghetto was not enclosed by fence, and it was possible to access non-Jewish areas of the city from it. Additionally, unlike other ghettos, the Aryan population was allowed to pass through the ghetto, and certain shops were allowed to remain open, allowing for a limited amount of goods to be kept in circulation. However, if Poles or other non-Jews were spotted purchasing goods from the Jewish vendors, policemen were ordered to remove them, and sometimes would even steal the merchandise for themselves. The ghetto would eventually be liquidated on September 22 through October 8, 1942, while Wendler was adjusting to his role in the Krak√≥w District.  Duties and Operations (Aktionen) in Krak√≥w District (1942-1943)  Prior to Operation Barbarossa, the General Government was divided into four districts, one of which was named after the Polish urban center of Krak√≥w. From its inception until January the 31st, 1942, the Krak√≥w District was overseen by Otto W√§chter, who reported to Governor-General Hans Frank. After Operation Barbarossa had begun, however, a fifth district was created, Galicia, to which W√§chter was transferred. Consequently, Wendler, at that time an SS Major General, was made Governor. Wendler, a longtime Nazi party member who had also been active in the SD, had an established rapport with ranking Nazi officials, most notably his brother-in-law Heinrich Himmler. This, in addition to his formal education in jurisprudence and political science and his experience as a lawyer and mayor made him an unsurprising choice for Governor of the district. Like his predecessor, Wendler reported to Hans Frank and aided in fulfilling the Governor-General's intentions, which primarily focused on the implementation of Aryanization policies. A major effect of these policies in the Krak√≥w District was the creation of ghettos; this was primarily due to the urban environment of the city of Krak√≥w, the capital of the General Government. Between October 1941 and February 1942, 25 ghettos were integrated into the district, in addition to several already in existence. German data from 1940 suggests that there were over 200,000 Jews in the District, however, it is likely this is an underestimate that neglects to include large numbers of refugees who came from other areas of Poland in 1939 as the result of German occupation. In addition to reporting to the Governor-General, District General Wendler oversaw the SS and Police Leader (SSPF), the preeminent police official of the District. The SSPF, and naturally, the Security Police and Gestapo, were Wendler's primary instruments of enforcement in the ghettos of the Krak√≥w District. As the result of policies designed to keep Jews in the ghetto and non-Jews out (in 1942), basic necessities became hard to come by, causing a black market to occur between the isolated Jews and nearby villagers. Subsequently, cruel enforcement and violence by the SSPF's Security Police and the Gestapo became more common. Many of these heinous instances were referred to officially as \\"Aktions.\\" One such Aktion in February 1942 involved the killing by the Security Police of about 50 Jews returning (with official discretion) from Eastern Galicia and one of similar circumstance occurred just a few weeks later, the justification being that these Jews were under suspicion due to the fact that they had previously lived under the rule of the Soviets. In March 1942 another Aktion occurred resulting in the deaths of 500 people, the designation of 750 people to be placed in the camp at Putskow, and the deportation of 3,000 to a variety of towns in the Lublin District. On July 13, 1942, Governor Wendler expressed immense praise for one of his henchmen, Kreishauptman Ehaus (who was responsible for Kreis Rzesz√≥w/Reichshof in the District), who had successfully made the Kreis almost entirely \\"judenfrei\\" (free of Jews) via shooting Aktions coordinated with the Security Police. The first of his underlings to make a Kreis \\"judenfrei\\", however, was one of Wendler's close friends, Walter Gentz, the Kreishauptman of Kreis Jas≈Ço. Gentz was notorious for his infamously harsh anti-Jewish policy and visible drive to make his Kreis free of Jews ahead of any of his contemporaries. As time progressed, Aktions by the SSPF and the Security Police veered from immediate, on-sight, senseless murder to deportation. The primary surge of these deportation-based Aktions in the Krak√≥w District occurred between June 1 and mid-September 1942, all of which had the final destination of the Belzec extermination center. The first of these major deportation Aktions from the Krak√≥w ghetto took place from June 1 until June 8, 1942, followed by deportations in the town of Slomniki and the Tarnow ghetto. After these deportations by Governor Wendler's men, the remaining majority of the District's Jewish population was removed Kreis (equivalent to a county; 12 originally in the District) by Kreis,in the following order: Reichshof and Debica (July); Jaroslau, Krosno, Jaslo, Neu-Sandez, Neumarkt, and Krakau-Land (August); Miechow, Sanok, and Tarnow (September). An additional large-scale deportation Aktion by the SSPF and his cohorts took place in October of that year, and the remaining small ghettos were cleared the following month. Additionally, while in the process of being deported, able-bodied Jews were selected and sent to labor camps and those who had connections to the Jewish Police or the Judenrate were often chosen to remain in the ghettos to sort through Jewish belongings. According to the Korherr Report, as a result of the Aktions carried out by Wendler's underlings, as of December the 31st, 1942, only about 37,000 of the previously conservative estimate of 200,000 Jews remained in the Krak√≥w District. In January 1943, Wendler attended a police conference in Krak√≥w. At the conference, Wendler spoke with great satisfaction about his excellent cooperation with the SSPF in the Krak√≥w District and mentioned that the \\"Judenaktion (Jewish Operation) took place without great unrest.\\" See also *List SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer References Bibliography * J√∂rg Wurdack: Dr. Richard Wendler; Oberb√ºrgermeister Hofs und Mitt√§ter bei der ‚ÄûEndl√∂sung‚Äú im besetzten Polen.

Simpson. In 1966, the California Governor Pat Brown appointed Fain to a Governor's Commission on the Family to study changes in law related to the family. The recommendations of the commission played a significant role in the passage of California's Family Law Act of 1970 introducing no-fault divorce.Los Angeles Times, \\"Harry M. Fain, 88; family law attorney pushed for no-fault divorce in state\\" July 14 2007 Early life and career Fain was born in Canora, Saskatchewan but grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. After graduating from high school, Fain went to the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) and represented UCLA in soccer. He joined the United States Army Air Forces where he worked in military intelligence. He studied law at the University of Southern California in 1946. For most of his career, Fain practiced family law in Beverly Hills, California. He divorced his first wife, Shirley Fain, in the early 1950s and eventually succeeded in obtaining custody of their three young children after it had initially been granted to his ex-wife. His position as an advocate of fathers rights and his support for the decision of custody being granted in the best interests of the children dates from that time. Governor's Commission on the Family Governor Pat Brown appointed Fain as one of the members of the Governor's Commission on the Family in 1966. The Commission recommended several significant changes to California family law including no- fault divorce, an equal division of property in marriage and a family court covering all of California. The 1970 Family Law Act was based, in part, on its recommendations. High profile family lawyer Fain became a principal of Fain, Lavine, Kaufman and Young in Beverly Hills. He represented many high profile individuals in family law matters. Fain negotiated a $1.5 million settlement between Elvis Presley and Priscilla Presley in 1973 as well as working for Cary Grant, Ali MacGraw, Rod Steiger, Lee Majors and Marguerite Simpson. Fain was a founder and president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. Fain died from pneumonia in July 2007.

Species There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Pseudotocinclus juquiae Takako, Oliveira & Oyakawa, 2005 * Pseudotocinclus parahybae Takako, Oliveira & Oyakawa, 2005 * Pseudotocinclus tietensis (Ihering (pt), 1907) Distribution and habitat Species of Pseudotocinclus are found in the upper Tiet√™ River basin in the ribeir√£o Grande, a tributary of the middle course of the rio Para√≠ba do Sul, Pindamonhangaba, in the headwaters of rio Itatinga, a coastal river of S√£o Paulo, and in the upper and lower courses of the Juqui√° River of the Ribeira de Iguape River basin, all rivers of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Like other members of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae, Pseudotocinclus is primarily herbivorous and is more commonly found at or near the upper portion of the water column. It lives in close association with sub-surface structures provided by submerged tree branches, aquatic macrophytes, and terrestrial grass blades growing along creek margins and extending into the water. Description The genus Pseudotocinclus can be distinguished from other genera of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae by the presence of a caudal peduncle that is nearly square in cross section from the posterior base of the dorsal fin to the caudal fin, as well as having 26 or more plates along the lateral line, a dorsally positioned eye, an exposed preopercle, and an abdomen covered with numerous small platelets. The presence of a small naked area on the snout tip distinguishes P. tietensis from P. parahybae and P. juquiae, which have the snout tip covered with small platelets. In addition, P. tietensis has four transverse dark-brown bands on the dorsum coalesced with the midlateral stripe instead of three as in the other two species. P. juquiae is distinguished from the other species by having a very prominent and conspicuous ring structure around the eye. The three species also differ from their congeners by meristics and morphometrics.

Cunningham remained a Parliamentary Secretary until Fianna F√°il lost power at the 1973 general election. When Blaney launched the Independent Fianna F√°il organisation most of the Fianna F√°il public representatives joined the new organisation.

The Peters Cartridge Company developed the cartridge in 1920 for use in the M1917 revolver, large numbers of which had become available as surplus following the end of World War I. Two issues related to the use of .45 ACP ammunition in the M1917 revolver led to the development of the .45 Auto Rim. The M1917 had previously been used with half-moon clips that held three rounds of .45 ACP, a rimless cartridge. But if half-moon or moon clips are not used when firing a rimless cartridge in a revolver, the spent cases must be ejected by hand‚Äîeither by shaking the revolver and its swing-out cylinder or by poking the cases with a rod or field-expedient tool, like a pencil‚Äîas the revolver's extractor cannot grab them. The second issue concerned headspace. In revolver cylinders not engineered to allow .45 ACP to headspace properly, as in early production Colt M1917s, the cartridges could slip forward, stopping them from firing. Adding a rim to the .45 ACP cartridge solved both these issues.Corbon .45 Auto Rim/.45 ACP cartridge Loads offered were similar to the standard military loads for the .45ACP, but with fully lead bullets rather than the full metal jacket bullets used for .45ACP.

Stuckey is best known as the creator of the cult TV show Pancake Mountain as well as his work with singer-songwriter Vic Chesnutt. Career Stuckey was born in Eastman, GA in 1964. His mother was an English teacher and father, W. S. Stuckey Jr., a Congressman from Georgia‚Äôs 8th district. His grandfather started Stuckey's, a chain of restaurant‚Äôs on the highway. The family moved to DC in 1966. In high school he was placed in a small creative school where he met like-minded people and discovered DC‚Äôs fledgling Punk Scene. He recalled how important this was in a Time Magazine profile ‚ÄúThe DC scene and Dischord (records) showed me that music could be created outside of traditional systems. There were no record companies or lawyers, just a bunch of teenage kids pressing vinyl in a basement, it was beautiful‚Äù. For the next few years he taught himself filmmaking. In 1984 he moved to NY City where he became friends with musician Ned Ebn and photographer Chris Makos. Both would heavily influence his passion for combining sound and motion images. In 1989 he began recording bands at his home studio in Athens, Ga. where he worked on projects with R.E.M. and Vic Chesnutt. Chesnutt recorded four albums there including 1991‚Äôs West of Rome. Stuckey and Chesnutt became close friends and worked on dozens of film and music projects that continued up until Chesnutt‚Äôs suicide in 2009. At the time of Chesnutt‚Äôs death he and Stuckey were working on a film and a rap album. Neither have been released. While working on an R.E.M video with director Jem Cohen in the early 1990s Stuckey began to move back to filmmaking. He would go on to direct music videos and documentaries for Thievery Corporation, Widespread Panic, Vic Chesnutt, Bob Mould, Minor Threat,http://www.splendidezine.com/features/evens/ Garbage, and others. Through Pancake Mountain he has directed and worked with artist such as Katy Perry, The White Stripes, M.I.A., and Eddie Vedder. As a songwriter Stuckey has written original songs for the show. Many of the contacts he made as a producer/engineer became early guests on Pancake Mountain. Work with Pancake Mountain Pancake Mountain was created by Stuckey as an homage to local TV as well as his fondness for DIY community-based art movements like DC's Dischord Records Scene and The Factory. In 2003 Stuckey created Pancake Mountain, a music based children‚Äôs show that paid homage to local 1960s and 1970s programing. He also credits the DIY community-based art movements like DC's Dischord Records Scene and Warhol‚Äôs Factory [4] as inspirations. Stuckey met Warhol through mutual friend Christopher Makos, and became fascinated by Warhol‚Äôs experimental films ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always wanted to make a kids show the way Warhol or Fellini might have approached it, more like an art project then typical programming‚Äù. His friendship and work with Dischord founder, Ian Mackaye led to Ian's group, The Evens, writing a song for the first episode of Pancake Mountain. The song, \\"Vowel Movements\\", was controversial in the punk scene, as Mackaye had never embraced music videos or lip-syncing. Despite initial trepidation from the punk community the song was well received and helped launch the show to a greater audience. The show has been credited as influencing a whole new genre of kid-based television, most notably the show Yo Gabba Gabba!, which began airing three years after \\"Pancake Mountain\\". In 2009 he found an unlikely fan in producer/director J. J. Abrams who wanted to produce the show. Abrams and Stuckey spent two years pitching the show, but every network either passed or wanted to make changes that Stuckey and Abrams were not willing to make. In February 2012, Stuckey and Abrams decided to stop pitching the show. The last skit was with Garbage‚Äôs Shirley Manson and talking dogs. On February 28, 2012, the Pancake Mountain website put up an announcement that the show was ending until a network would give them full creative control. Production halted until April 2014, when The New York Times reported that PBS was going to bring Pancake Mountain back as part of their PBS Digital Studios with Stuckey having full creative control. The first episode premiered on June 9, 2014. and is expected to end in September 2016. Critical response He was named a pioneer of children‚Äôs television by Time magazine and the show was listed as one of the 10 best of 2007 by the Los Angeles Times. CNN's Chuck Roberts credited Stuckey with creating a new genre for television. Inspiration The Rufus Leaking character (puppet) is loosely based on Ignatius Riley, the protagonist from A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole. Stuckey took the name Rufus Leaking from Widespread Panic‚Äôs Dave Schools, who used the name as his alias when checking into hotels.

Physical properties  Dutch process cocoa (left) compared to Broma process, or \\"natural\\", cocoa (right) Natural cocoa powder has a light- brown color and an extractable pH of 5.3 to 5.8. The processed (alkalized) cocoa powder is darker in color, ranging from brownish red to nearly black, with a pH of 6.8 to 8.1. The alkalization process reduces bitterness and improves solubility, which is important for beverage product applications. All of these pH values are considered safe for food use.Materials Handled Cocoa Powder: Overview . Retrieved: 2 April 2014.  Nutrition  Cocoa powder contains several minerals, including calcium, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc. All these minerals are found in greater quantities in cocoa powder than either cocoa butter or chocolate liquor. Cocoa powder also contains 230 mg of caffeine and 2057 mg of theobromine per 100g, which are mostly absent from the other components of the cocoa bean. Cocoa powder also contains clovamide (N-caffeoyl-L-DOPA). = Flavonoids = Cocoa powder is rich in flavonoids, a subset of polyphenols. The amount of flavonoids depends on the amount of processing and manufacturing the cocoa powder undergoes. Alkalization, also known as Dutch processing, causes its content of flavonoids to be substantially reduced.  Safety  =Cadmium content= Cocoa powders may contain cadmium, a toxic heavy metal and probable carcinogen, found naturally in high levels in the soil of some regions of cocoa-producing countries. The European Union has imposed a limit (as of 1 January 2019) for cadmium in cocoa powder of 0.6 ¬µg per gram of cocoa powder and 0.8 ¬µg per gram for chocolate with ‚â• 50% total dry cocoa solids. In Canada, a daily serving of a natural health product must contain no more than 6 ¬µg of cadmium for an individual weighing and 3 ¬µg for a individual. While the US government has not set a limit for cadmium in foods or health products, the state of California has established a maximum allowable daily level of oral cadmium exposure of 4.1 ¬µg and requires products containing more than this amount per daily serving to bear a warning on the label. One investigation by an independent consumer testing laboratory found that seven of nine commercially available cocoa powders and nibs selected for testing contained more than 0.3 ¬µg of cadmium per serving gram; five of these products exceeded the proposed EU limit of 0.6 ¬µg per gram.

During the years of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship he served as Ambassador to Argentina. A staunch militarist, he became at the end of his ideological path one of the most prominent Far-right theorists against the Second Republic, leading the reactionary voices calling for a military coup.

In 1934, his final published book was written, Defensa de la hispanidad (\\"In Defense of Spanishness\\"), advocating \\"a return to pure Spanishness\\" and strongly condemning Liberalism and the French Revolution's slogan \\"Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©\\", which he countered by his own motto: Duty, hierarchy, and humanity. He thought of Spanishness as a spiritual world that united Spain and its former colonies by the Spanish language and Catholicism, rationalism and democracy being supposedly alien to the Hispanic ethos. On October 29, 1936, Maeztu was murdered by Republican soldiers in the early days of the Spanish Civil War while near Madrid.Arredondo, Christopher Britt (2005). Quixotism: The Imaginative Denial of Spain's Loss of Empire, SUNY Press, p. 91. The following last words are attributed to him: \\"You do not know why you kill me, but I know why I'm dying: For your children to be better than you!\\"Gonz√°lez Cuevas, Pedro Carlos (2003). Maeztu: Biograf√≠a de un Nacionalista Espa√±ol, Marcial Pons Historia, p. 359. His political thoughts had a profound influence on Chilean historian Jaime Eyzaguirre. His younger sister was the Spanish educator and feminist, Mar√≠a de Maeztu who founded the Residencia de Se√±oritas and the Lyceum Club in Madrid, and his younger brother was the painter Gustavo de Maeztu who has a museum named for him in the Palace of the Kings of Navarre in Estella, Spain. Spanish philosopher Jos√© Ortega y Gasset dedicated his book Meditations on Quixote (1914) to Maeztu ‚Äî \\"A Ramiro de Maeztu, con un gesto fraternal.\\"Ortega y Gasset, Jos√© (1914).

With a large numbert of recent discoveries, particularly in Myanmar in recent years, confusion has been caused. As a result, a separate page has been created which lists all danionin species and also lists defunct species which have since been synonymised or renamed. Individual danionin species are listed below in order of genus: Species categorised by genus =Danio= The species remaining in the genus Danio comprise most of the danionins familiar to aquarists. They have two pairs of long barbels and are generally characterised by horizontal stripes (with the exception of the Panther Danio, Glowlight Danio and Black Barred Danio which have vertical bars. In size they range from 4 cm/ 1.75 in) to 15 cm/ 6 in).

Generally larger fish than Danios, they have short barbels (if present at all) and generally have deeper bodies than Danio, with species having vertical stripes present (as well as horizontal). In size, they range from 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 in). *Devario acuticephala *Devario aequipinnatus - Giant Danio *Devario affinis - False Giant Danio *Devario apogon *Devario assamensis - Red Mirik Danio *Devario annandalei - Annandale's Giant Danio *Devario browni - Browns Danio *Devario chrysotaeniatus Gold Striped Danio *Devario devario - Bengal Danio or Sind Danio *Devario interruptus *Devario maetaengensis - Fire Bar Danio *Devario laoensis - Laos Giant Danio *Devario malabaricus - Malabar Danio *Devario pathirana - Barred Danio *Devario regina - Queen Danio *Devario shanensis - Shan Danio *Devario sondhii - Sondhi's Danio *Devario strigillifer *Devario sp \\"Broken Line\\" - Blue Moon Danio *Devario sp \\"giraffe\\" - Giraffe Danio =Little-known Devario species= Little is known about the following Devario species, but some information exists about them at the Fishbase Devario index(Fishbase: Ed.

Danionella Danionella comprises tiny, recently discovered fish. *Danionella mirifica *Danionella translucida Microrasbora The genus name Microrasbora means \\"small Rasbora\\", but these fish appear to be more closely related to the Danio species than Rasbora. Speculation exists that Microrasbora erythromicron may be transferred to the genus Danio, but this now seems unlikely. *Microrasbora erythromicron *Microrasbora gatesi *Microrasbora kubotai *Microrasbora nana *Microrasbora rubescens Paedocypris Paedocypris contains the smallest known fish in the world. *Paedocypris micromegethes *Paedocypris progenetica Sundadanio A genus with only one species, the genus Sundadanio was created after Rasbora axelrodi species was transferred to this genus. S. axelrodi resembles a tiny Rasbora. *Sundadanio axelrodi Danionins renamed or wrongly identified These genera that previously described certain danionins are no longer valid: * Allodanio * Brachydanio * Danioides * Daniops * Eustira * Parabarilius * Paradanio * Rambaibarnia All Devario species were formerly in the genus Danio.

She is currently a practicing psychoanalyst in New York City where she is on the faculty of the New York University Postdoctoral Psychology Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy,Jessica Benjamin, New York Institute for the Humanities at New York University (accessed September 8, 2008). and the Stephen Mitchell Center for Relational Studies. Jessica Benjamin is one of the original contributors to the fields of relational psychoanalysis, theories of intersubjectivity, and gender studies and feminism as it relates to psychoanalysis and society. She is known for her ideas about recognition in both human development and the sociopolitical arena. Early life and education Jessica Benjamin was born to a Jewish familyJewish Women's Archives: \\"Psychology in the United States\\" by Rhoda K. Unger] retrieved March 26, 2017 and earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1967, and her MA from the University of Frankfurt in West Germany, where she studied Psychology, Sociology and Philosophy. Jessica Benjamin earned her PhD in Sociology from NYU in 1978. She received her psychoanalytic training from New York University Postdoctoral Psychology Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy and engaged in post doc research on infancy with Dr. Beatrice Beebe at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Contributions to the field Benjamin is considered to be one of the most important and influential psychoanalysts of the last four decades. She is one of the founders of relational psychoanalysis, and is one of the first to introduce feminism and gender studies into psychoanalytic thought. Her early studies included social structure and feminism, but more recently she is known for her effort to explain the classical aspects of psychoanalysis using object relations, relational psychoanalysis, and feminist thought.Spring Workshop 2000: Jessica Benjamin, Ph.D. , Dallas Society for Psychoanalytic Psychology (accessed September 8, 2008). She has made significant contributions to the concept of intersubjectivity in psychoanalysis.Harriet Kimble Wrye, Review of Shadow of the Other, Dallas Psychoanalytic Center, reprinted from Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association 47 (accessed September 8, 2008). In 2015, Benjamin received the Hans-Kilian-Award for her achievements in the fields of psychoanalysis, feminist psychology and the theory of intersubjective recognition. She is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities.  Selected bibliography  = Books = Benjamin has published four books. In The Bonds of Love: Psychoanalysis, Feminism and the Problem of Domination (1988) Benjamin undertook a major revision of Freud's theories of both human development and sexuality. Using contemporary research on infancy and gender, she argued for the importance of recognition and the intersubjective relationship. Against this background, she showed how relationships of domination involve the alienation of recognition, and a form of gender splitting she called gender polarity. She argued that we accept and perpetuate relationships of domination not because of an inherent aggressive instinct, but the difficulty of recognizing the Other. She theorizes that domination is a complex psychological process which ensnares both parties in bonds of complicity, and supports this by showing how it affects our family life, our social institutions, and especially our sexual relations, in spite of our conscious commitment to equality and freedom.The Bonds of Love by Jessica Benjamin, Pantheon Books (accessed September 8, 2008). The Bonds of Love, Revisited is an edition that celebrates the influence of Jessica Benjamin's work through fifteen essays that look back on the book's impact, offering theoretical deliberations and elaborations of the book's original themes and reflection on the book's impact personally and professionally, for clinicians and feminists around the world. Benjamin's second book, Like Subjects, Love Objects: Essays on Recognition and Sexual Difference (1995) further developed the psychoanalytic theory of intersubjectivity, revising Freud's oedipal theory to include both genders' need to integrate independence and connection. She builds on the foundation of Freud's Oedipal theory, critically revising it to include the female's struggle for independence. She argues that traditional Freudian theories inevitably reproduce patriarchal gender relationships which are characterized by domination and submission, most notably reflected in the cultural polarity of male rationality and female vulnerability.Like Subjects, Love Objects: Essays on Recognition and Sexual Difference by Jessica Benjamin, Yale University Press (accessed September 8, 2008). Shadow of the Other: Intersubjectivity and Gender in Psychoanalysis (1997), extends Benjamin's work on intersubjectivity, love and aggression. In 2017, Benjamin published her fourth book, Beyond Doer and Done to: Recognition Theory, Intersubjectivity and the Third, an expansion of her theory of mutual recognition and its breakdown into the complementarity of \\"doer and done to.\\" = Articles = Benjamin's 2004 article \\"Beyond doer and done to: An intersubjective view of thirdness\\" is the 4th most cited journal article in the field of psychoanalysis.

Among many others, he taught at Chicago Law School, Stanford Law School, University of California, Berkeley Law School, University of California, Los Angeles Law School, and Michigan Law School. Van Alstyne received his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy magna cum laude from the University of Southern California. He received his Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School. Following his admission to the California Bar and brief service as deputy attorney general of California, he joined the civil rights division of the U. S. department of justice, handling voting rights cases in the South. For many years, he was active in the American Association of University of Professors (AAUP). Following active duty with the U. S. Air Force, he was appointed to the law faculty of the Ohio State University, advancing to full professor in three years. Van Alstyne was named to Duke's William R. and Thomas S. Perkins Chair of Law in 1974. He held a certificate from The Hague Academy of International Law and has been honored with LL.D. degrees by Wake Forest University and the College of William and Mary. In 1987, Van Alstyne was selected in a poll by the New York Law Journal of federal judges, attorneys, and academics, as one of three academics among \\"the ten most qualified\\" persons in the country for appointment to the supreme court, a distinction repeated in a similar poll by The American Lawyer, in 1991. Past national president of the American Association of University Professors and former member of the national board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union, he was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994. Van Alstyne's body of work included many books, law journal articles, and congressional committee testimony. In 1994, he was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. An article in the January 2000 Journal of Legal Studies found that Van Alstyne was among the top 40 legal scholars in the United States in number of academic citations.Shapiro, Fred R. \\"The Most- Cited Legal Scholars.\\" Journal of Legal Studies 29.1 (Jan. 2000): 409-426. 14 July 2007.

Details The X and Y bosons couple quarks to leptons (such as a positron), allowing violation of the conservation of baryon number, and thus permitting proton decay. An X boson would have the following decay modes: : + -> \\\\+ : + -> \\\\+ where the two decay products in each process have opposite chirality, is an up quark, is a down antiquark and is a positron.

Similar decay products exist for the other quark-lepton generations. In these reactions, neither the lepton number (L) nor the baryon number (B) is conserved, but is. Different branching ratios between the X boson and its antiparticle (as is the case with the K-meson) would explain baryogenesis.

Typically, complexes containing non- innocent ligands are redox active at mild potentials. The concept assumes that redox reactions in metal complexes are either metal or ligand localized, which is a simplification, albeit a useful one. . C.K. J√∏rgensen first described ligands as \\"innocent\\" and \\"suspect\\": \\"Ligands are innocent when they allow oxidation states of the central atoms to be defined. The simplest case of a suspect ligand is NO...\\" Redox reactions of complexes of innocent vs. non- innocent ligands Conventionally, redox reactions of coordination complexes are assumed to be metal-centered. The reduction of MnO4‚àí to MnO42‚àí is described by the change in oxidation state of manganese from 7+ to 6+. The oxide ligands do not change in oxidation state, remaining 2- (a more careful examination of the electronic structure of the redox partners reveals however that the oxide ligands are affected by the redox change). Oxide is an innocent ligand. Another example of conventional metal-centered redox couple is [Co(NH3)6]3+/[Co(NH3)6]2+. Ammonia is innocent in this transformation. :700px Redox non-innocent behavior of ligands is illustrated by nickel bis(stilbenedithiolate) ([Ni(S2C2Ph2)2]z), which exists in three oxidation states: z = 2-, 1-, and 0. If the ligands are always considered to be dianionic (as is done in formal oxidation state counting), then z = 0 requires that that nickel has a formal oxidation state of +IV. The formal oxidation state of the central nickel atom therefore ranges from +II to +IV in the above transformations (see Figure). However, the formal oxidation state is different from the real (spectroscopic) oxidation state based on the (spectroscopic) metal d-electron configuration. The stilbene-1,2-dithiolate behaves as a redox non-innocent ligand, and the oxidation processes actually take place at the ligands rather than the metal. This leads to the formation of ligand radical complexes. The charge-neutral complex (z =0) is therefore best described as a Ni2+ derivative of S2C2Ph2‚àí. The diamagnetism of this complex arises from anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the unpaired electrons of the two ligand radicals. Another example is higher oxidation states of copper complexes of diamido phenyl ligands that are stabilized by intramolecular multi center hydrogen bonding Typical non-innocent ligands *Nitrosyl (NO) binds to metals in one of two extreme geometries - bent where NO is treated as a pseudohalide (NO‚àí), and linear, where NO is treated as NO+. *Dioxygen can be non-innocent, since it exists in two oxidation states, superoxide (O2‚àí) and peroxide (O22‚àí). Ligands with extended pi-delocalization such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, and corroles and ligands with the generalised formulas [D-CR=CR-D]n‚àí (D = O, S, NR‚Äô and R, R' = alkyl or aryl) are often non- innocent.

The additional redox equivalents provided by redox non-innocent ligands are also used as controlling factors to steer homogeneous catalysis. =Hemes= Oxygen rebound mechanism utilized by cytochrome P450 for conversion of hydrocarbons to alcohols via the action of \\"compound I\\", an iron(IV) oxide bound to a radical heme, which is non-innocent. Porphyrin ligands can be innocent (2-) or noninnocent (1-).

In other heme proteins, such as myoglobin, ligand- centered redox does not occur and the porphyrin is innocent. =Galactose oxidase= :450px The catalytic cycle of galactose oxidase (GOase) illustrates the involvement of non-innocent ligands. GOase oxidizes primary alcohols into aldehydes using O2 and releasing H2O2. The active site of the enzyme GOase features a tyrosyl coordinated to a CuII ion. In the key steps of the catalytic cycle, a cooperative Br√∏nsted-basic ligand-site deprotonates the alcohol, and subsequently the oxygen atom of the tyrosinyl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alpha-CH functionality of the coordinated alkoxide substrate. The tyrosinyl radical participates in the catalytic cycle: 1e-oxidation is effected by the Cu(II/I) couple and the 1e oxidation is effected by the tyrosyl radical, giving an overall 2e change. The radical abstraction is fast. Anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the unpaired spins of the tyrosine radical ligand and the d9 CuII center gives rise to the diamagnetic ground state, consistent with synthetic models.

DMC describes atmospheric conditions producing single or clusters of large vertical extension clouds ranging from cumulus congestus to cumulonimbus, the latter producing thunderstorms associated with lightning and thunder. Those two types of clouds can produce severe weather at the surface and aloft. The detection monitor associated phenomena such as tornadoes as well as large hail, strong winds, and heavy rain leading to flash flooding. It relies on direct eyewitness observations, for example from storm spotters; and on remote sensing, especially weather radar. Some in situ measurements are used for direct detection as well, notably, wind speed reports from surface observation stations. It is part of the integrated warning system, consisting of prediction, detection, and dissemination of information on severe weather to users such as emergency management, storm spotters and chasers, the media, and the general public.  History  1960s radar technology (WSR-57) displaying supercells over Minneapolis ‚Äì Saint Paul during the 1965 Twin Cities tornado outbreak Rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, with the advent of weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that hook echoes are associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms likely producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away.  Storm spotting  In the mid-1970s, the US National Weather Service (NWS) increased its efforts to train storm spotters to identify and report key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can issue a timely warning. Usually, spotters are trained by the NWS on behalf of their respective organizations, and they report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as sirens and the Emergency Alert System, and forward the reports to the NWS, which does directly disseminate information and warnings through its NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards network. There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather spotters across the United States. In Canada, a similar network of volunteer weather watchers, called Canwarn, helps spot severe weather, with more than 1,000 volunteers. In Europe, several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of Skywarn EuropeSkywarn Europe, Archived at: , retrieved on 2007-05-18 and the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since the 1970s. Storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as NEXRAD, and satellite images, do not detect tornadoes or hail, only indications that the storm has the potential.Chance Hayes, National Weather Service Wichita, Kansas. \\"Storm Fury on the Plains.\\" Storm Spotter Training. 4H Building, Salina, Kansas. 22 Feb. 2010. Lecture. Radar and satellite data interpretation will usually give a warning before there is any visual evidence of such events, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine it is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what these remote sensing devices cannot is especially important as distance from a radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, due to curvature of Earth and the spread of the beam with distance. Therefore, when far from a radar, only precipitations and velocities high in the storm are observed. The important areas might not then be sampled or the resolution of the data might be poor. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data. = Visual evidence = A rotating wall cloud with rear flank downdraft clear slot evident to its left rear. Storm spotters are trained to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is the formation of a rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell. Evidence of a supercell comes from the storm's shape and structure, and cloud tower features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent and/or large overshooting top, a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level winds), and a corkscrew look or striations. Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a \\"beaver tail\\", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the forward flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and forward flank downdraft, and requires a \\"balance\\" between the outflow and inflow. Only wall clouds that rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual manifestation of a mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases by the time it reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters monitor all areas of a storm and their surroundings.  Radar  Today, most developed countries have a network of weather radars, which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes and other severe phenomenons as hail and downbursts. Radar is always available, in places and times where spotters are not, and can also see features that spotters cannot, in the darkness of night and processes hidden within the cloud as well as invisible processes outside the cloud. = Tornadoes = Doppler NEXRAD radar image of two mesocyclones with one supercell passing over Northern Michigan on July 3rd, 1999 at 23:41 UTC. Rotations is seen as small couplets of red (away) and green (toward) radial velocities. The thick circles represents 3D vortices which have been classified as mesocyclones near the ground by a detection algorithm. The left mesocyclone is associated with a tornado while to the right a larger area of rotation has developed. A classic hook echo. The tornado associated with this echo was part of the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak. It reached F5 strength on the Fujita scale. BWER. In short-term prediction and detection of tornadoes, meteorologists integrate radar data with reports from the field and knowledge of the meteorological environment. Radar analysis is augmented by automated detection systems called algorithms. Meteorologists first look at the atmospheric environment as well as changes thereof, and once storms develop, storm motion and interaction with the environment. An early step in a storm organizing into a tornado producer is the formation of a weak echo region (WER) with a tilted updraft. This is an area within the thunderstorm where precipitation should be occurring but is \\"pulled\\" aloft by a very strong updraft. The weak echo region is characterized by weak reflectivity with a sharp gradient to strong reflectivity above it and partially surrounding the sides. The region of the precipitation lofted above the WER is the echo overhang consisting of precipitation particles diverging from the storm's summit that descend as they are carried downwind. Within this area, a bounded weak echo region (BWER) may then form above and enclosing the WER. A BWER is found near the top of the updraft and nearly or completely surrounded by strong reflectivity, and is indicative of a supercell capable of cyclic tornadogenesis. A mesocyclone may descend or a tornado may form in the lower level of the storm simultaneously as the mesocyclone forms. In reflectivity (precipitation intensity) data, a tight echo gradient (particularly on the inflow area) and a fan shape generally indicate a supercell. A V-notch or \\"flying eagle echo\\" tend to be most pronounced with intense classic supercells, the type of supercell that produces most of the strongest, largest, and longest lived tornadoes. This is not to be confused with an inflow notch; which is a lower level indentation in the precipitation where there is little to no reflectivity, indicative of strong, organized inflow and a severe storm that is most likely a supercell. The rear inflow notch (or weak echo channel) occurs to the east or north of a mesocyclone and hook echo. Forward inflow notches also occur, particularly on high-precipitation supercells (HP) and quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS). In the United States and a few other countries, Doppler capable weather radar stations are used. These devices are capable of measuring the radial velocity, including radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160 km) away. A supercell is characterized by a mesocyclone, which is usually first observed in velocity data as a tight, cyclonic structure in the middle levels of the thunderstorm. If it meets certain requirements of strength, duration, and vorticity, it may trip the mesocyclone detection algorithm (MDA). Tornadic signatures are indicated by a cyclonic inbound-outbound velocity couplet, where strong winds flowing in one direction and strong winds flowing in the opposite direction are occurring in very close proximity. The algorithm for this is the tornadic vortex signature (TVS) or the tornado detection algorithm (TDA). TVS is then an extremely strong mesocyclone found at very low level and extending over a deep layer of the thunderstorm, not the actual tornadic circulation. The TVS is, however, indicative of a likely tornado or an incipient tornado. The couplet and TVS typically precede tornado formation by 10‚Äì30 minutes but may occur at nearly the same time or precede the tornado by 45 minutes or more. Polarimetric radar can discern meteorological and nonmeteorological and other characteristics of hydrometeors that are helpful to tornado detection and nowcasting. Nonmeteorological reflectors co-located with a couplet, can confirm that a tornado has likely occurred and lofted debris. An area of high reflectivity, or debris ball, may also be visible on the end of the hook. Either the polarimetric data or debris ball are formally known as the tornado debris signature (TDS). The hook echo feature is formed as the RFD occludes precipitation around the mesocyclone and is also indicative of a probable tornado (tornadogenesis usually ensues shortly after the RFD reaches the surface). After the implementation of the WSR-88D network in the U.S., the probability of detection of tornadoes increased substantially, the average lead time rose from four minutes to thirteen minutes, and a 2005 NOAA report estimates that as a result of improved warnings that there are 45 percent fewer fatalities and 40 percent fewer injuries annually. Dual-polarization radar, being implemented to the US NEXRAD network, may provide enhanced warning of tornadoes and severe winds and hail associated with the hook echo due to distinct precipitation drop characteristics. Polarimetric radar boosts precipitation observation and prediction, especially rainfall rates, hail detection, and distinguishing precipitation types. Proposed radar technologies, such as phased array and CASA, would further improve observations and forecasts by increasing the temporal and spatial resolution of scans in the former as well as providing low-level radar data over a wide area in the latter. In certain atmospheric environments, wind profilers may also provide detection capabilities for tornadic activity. = Hail, downburst and downpour = Vertical cross-section of a thunderstorm at the top and VIL value of 63 kg/m2 with that cell at the bottom (red one), giving potential for hail, downpour, and/or downdraft Hail forms in a very intense updraft in a supercell or a multicellular thunderstorm. As for tornadoes, BWER detection and a tilted updraft are indicative of that updraft but does not lead to predict hail. The presence of a hail spike in the reflectivity pattern is an important clue. It is an area of weak reflectivity extending away from the radar immediately behind a thunderstorm with hail. It is caused by radiation from the radar bouncing from hailstone to hailstone or the ground before being reflected back to the radar. The time delay between the backscattered radiation from the storm and the one with multiple paths causes the reflectivity from the hail to appear to come from a farther range than the actual storm. However, this artefact is visible mostly for extremely large hail. What is needed is a knowledge of the water content in the thunderstorm, the freezing level and the height of the summit of the precipitation. One way of calculating the water content is to transform the reflectivities in rain rate at all levels in the clouds and to sum it up. This is done by an algorithm called Vertically integrated liquid, or VIL. This value represent the total amount of liquid water in the cloud that is available. If the cloud would rain out completely, it would be the amount of rain falling on the ground and one can estimate with VIL the potential for flash flood. However, the reflectivities are greatly enhanced by hail and VIL is greatly overestimating the rain potential in presence of hail. On the other hand, National Weather Service meteorologists have found that the VIL density, that is to say VIL divided by the maximum height of the 18 dBZ in the cloud, is a good indicator of the presence of hail when it reach 3.5. This is a crude yes/no index and other algorithms have been developed involving VIL and the freezing level height. More recently, dual polarization of weather radar have shown promising direct detection of hail. VIL can be used to estimate the potential for downburst, too. A convective downdraft is linked to three forces in the vertical, namely perturbation pressure gradient force, buoyancy force and precipitation loading. The pressure gradient force was neglected as it has significant effect only on the updraft in supercells. With this assumption and other simplifications (e.g. requiring the environment of the air parcel to be static on the time scale of the downdraft). The resulting momentum equation is integrated over height to yield the kinetic energy of the parcel on descending to the surface and is found to be the negative CAPE of a dry air parcel injected into the storm, plus de motion of the convective cell. S. R. Stewart, from NWS, has published in 1991 an equation relating VIL and the echo tops that give the potential for surface gust using this concept. This is a predictive result that gives a certain lead time. With the Doppler velocity data, the meteorologist can see the downdraft and gust fronts happening, but since this a small scale feature, detection algorithms have been developed to point convergence and divergence areas under a thunderstorm on the radar display.  Satellite imagery  significant tornado outbreak in the eastern United States with arrows pointing to the enhanced-v signatures. Most populated areas of the earth are now well covered by weather satellites, which aid in the nowcasting of severe convective and tornadic storms. These images are available in the visible and infrared domains. The infrared (IR: 10-13 ¬µm) images permit estimation of the top height of the clouds, according to the air mass soundings of the day, and the visible (vis: 0.5-1.1 ¬µm) ones will show the shape of the storms by its brightness and shadow produced. Meteorologists can extract information about the development stage and subsequent traits of thunderstorms by recognizing specific signatures in both domains. Visible imagery permits the most detailed imagery whereas infrared imagery has the advantage of availability at night. Sensors on satellites can also detect emissions from water vapor (WV: 6-7 ¬µm), but mostly in the middle to upper levels of the troposphere, so thunderstorms are only seen after being well developed. It is, however, useful in convective storm prediction, as it illustrates the placement and movement of air masses and of moisture, as well as shortwaves and areas of vorticity and lifts. Severe storms have a very strong updraft. The rising air parcels in that column accelerate and will overshoot the equilibrium level (EL) before being pulled back by negative buoyancy. This means the cloud tops will reach higher levels than the surrounding cloud in the updraft region. This overshooting top will be noticeable by a colder temperature region in the thunderstorm on infrared images. Another signature associated with this situation is the Enhanced-V feature where the cold cloud tops forming at the overshooting top fan out in a V shape as cloud matter is blown downwind at that level. Both features can be seen on visible satellite imagery, during daytime, by the shadows they cast on surrounding clouds. In multicellular storms and squall lines, the mid-level jet stream is often intersecting the line and its dry air introduced into the cloud is negatively unstable. This results in drying of the cloudy air in the region where the jet plunge groundward. On the back edge of the line, this shows as clear notches where one can find stronger downdrafts at the surface. These kinds of lines often have a very characteristic undulating pattern caused by the interference of the gusts fronts coming from different parts of the line. Finally, in any type of thunderstorm, the surface cold pool of air associated with the downdraft will stabilize the air and form a cloud-free area that will end along the gust front. This mesoscale front, when moving into a warm and unstable air mass, will lift it and cumulus clouds appear on satellite pictures. This line is likely the point of further convection and storms, especially if it coincides with fronts from other thunderstorms in the vicinity. One can notice it at the leading edge of a squall line, in the southeastern quadrant of a typical supercell (in the northern hemisphere), or different regions around other thunderstorms. They may also be visible as an outflow boundary hours or days after convection and can pinpoint areas of favored thunderstorm development, the possible direction of movement, and even likelihood for tornadoes. The speed of forward movement of the outflow boundary or gust front to some degree modulates the likelihood of tornadoes and helps determine whether a storm will be enhanced by its presence or the inflow be choked off thus weakening and possibly killing the storm. Thunderstorms may move along slow-moving or stationary outflow boundaries and tornadoes are more likely; whereas fast-moving gust fronts in many cases weaken thunderstorms after impact and are less likely to produce tornadoes‚Äîalthough brief tornadoes may occur at the time of impact. Fast- moving gust fronts may eventually decelerate and become slow-moving or stationary outflow boundaries with the characteristic \\"agitated area\\" of cumulus fields previously mentioned.  Lightning detection  Usually in conjunction with data sources such as weather radar and satellites, lightning detection systems are sometimes utilized to pinpoint where thunderstorms are occurring (and to identify lightning hazard). Currently, most lightning data provided in real-time is from terrestrial sources, specifically, networks of ground-based sensors, although airborne sensors are also in operation. Most of these only provide latitude & longitude, time, and polarity of cloud-to-ground strikes within a limited range. Increasing in sophistication and availability, and affording data for a very wide area, are satellite-based lightning detectors which initially included optical sensors indicating flash rates and horizontal location but now radio frequency receivers that can identify intra- cloud flashes with the addition of altitude, as well. Lightning data is useful in suggesting intensity and organization of convective cells as well trends in thunderstorm activity (particularly growth, and to a lesser degree, decay). It is also useful in the early stages of thunderstorm development. This was especially true when visible and infrared satellite data was delayed, but continues to be useful in detecting thunderstorms in stages of development before there is a substantial radar signature or for areas where radar data is lacking. Coming advances in research and observations should improve forecasts of severe weather and increase warning time. Personal lightning detection systems are also available, which may provide strike time, azimuth, and distance. In addition, lightning prediction systems are available and used mostly by parks and other outdoor recreational facilities, or meteorologists contracted to provide weather information for them.

Thanks to the presence of the business centers of Courtaboeuf and Grand D√¥me as well as the commercial center of Villebon 2, it has become one of the richest communes in the department. The inhabitants of Villebon-sur-Yvette are known as Villebonnais. Geography Villebon-sur-Yvette is located in the Hurepoix area on the river Yvette, in the valley of the same name (also called Vall√©e de Chevreuse) on ground that is composed of milled stone, sand and clay. It covers an area of 743 ha between the Courtab≈ìuf industrial park and the river, divided into sections of 426 ha of residential construction, 165 ha of forest and 152 ha of agricultural land, protected by the air lane of Orly Airport. Villebon-sur-Yvette is located approximately from Massy and Gif-sur-Yvette, from Longjumeau, from Montlh√©ry and to the south-west of Notre Dame de Paris.

It is one of the few stations in Europe using AM Stereo. History Until 1056, the history of Villebon-sur- Yvette is related to that of Palaiseau. On this date, Fromand de Paris became the first lord of Villebon. Under the reign of his son, Aszo, the name Villabona was adopted in 1092. He built a farm on the current site of the castle. In 1196, Gautier of Villebon became Grand Chamberman of France. He was followed by Peter of Nemours, Bishop of Paris from 1208 to 1219. Lambert of Villebon left to follow the Eighth Crusade to Tunisia in 1270 with King Louis IX. In 1474, the area of Villebon became the property of the De Thou family. In 1512, Augustin of Thou had built in place of the existing residence a small Renaissance-style castle, today known as Henri IV House. In 1563 Nicolas de Thou, lord of Villebon and bishop of Chartres, obtained permission from King Charles IX to establish a weekly market, held every Thursday, and two fairs, on 27 September and 12 November, for which Villebon gained a certain amount of recognition. In 1587, it made build a vault with Villebon under the invocation of Saints Cosmas and Damian. In 1793, the Court of Appeal of Paris decided to separate Yvette from the two communities of Villebon and Palaiseau. The introduction of a rail-link to Paris at the beginning of the 20th century allowed Villebon, like its neighbors, to develop its industry and reputation as a tourist destination for Parisians. On 23 June 1920, the real estate company the School of √éle-de-France, represented by Mr. Hawkins, a former pupil of the University of Cambridge acquired the castle, its dependences and the surrounding 100 hectares of forest and meadows for one million francs. In 1922, in order to avoid confusion with the commune of Villebon in the 'd√©partement' of Eure-et-Loir, the commune adopted the name of Villebon-on- Yvette, in reference to the nearby river.

The plant was elevated to the species level in 2006 based on new morphological and genetic information and was previously treated as a variety of Arundinaria tecta. As a relatively small member of its genus, it usually only attains heights of 0.5 to 1.0 metre with an either dense or diffuse habit. It is one of only three temperate species of bamboo native to North America. Hill cane is common on dry to mesic sites on upland slopes, bluffs and ridges in oak- hickory forests. In contrast to its sympatric relatives, Arundinaria gigantea typically appears along perennial streams, while A. tecta is found in swamps and other very wet areas. Taxonomy There has long been question to the taxonomic status of the eastern North American bamboos. Two species were originally described by Thomas Walter in 1788, namely Arundo gigantea and Arundo tecta. Since that time the phenotypic diversity of the American bamboos has led to a variety of taxonomic treatments. One of the more recent and thorough surveys of Arundinaria was undertaken by Floyd Alonzo McClure in 1973 and includes only one species, namely Arundinaria gigantea. Arundinaria appalachiana was first distinguished under the name Arundinaria tecta var. decidua, which was applied by C.D. Beadle in 1914 upon noticing the deciduous leaves. Beadle himself and many botanists to follow noted that hill cane may be a distinct species. During the second half of the twentieth century it became quite clear that hill cane could not be properly treated within A. tecta or A. gigantea. After cladistic genetic analysis was performed by Triplett and Clark it was determined that each of the three types of cane has a monophyletic lineage, supporting the case for three species. Morphological analysis has also supported this decision. Description Arundinaria appalachiana is the smallest member of its genus with the culms (i.e. the above-ground stems) usually attaining heights of 0.5 to 1 metre, though they are sometimes up to 1.8 metres tall. They are also quite thin at 0.2 to 0.6 cm in diameter. As with all bamboos, the culms emerge from subterranean rhizomes. In the case of hill cane, these are leptomorph, meaning they spread horizontally, but they typically do not reach very far before turning up to form a new culm. The rhizomes vary somewhat morphologically in that they sometimes have hollow centres and air canals The culms have internodes that are terete (i.e. smooth and cylindrical, but slightly tapering), while the culm sheaths are usually persistent (meaning they are not shed), but they may fall late in winter. These sheaths are 5.5 to 11 cm in length with oral setae (i.e. bristles where the sheath meets the blade) that are very short at 1 to 4.6 mm. The culm blades that appear at the apex of the sheaths are much shorter than the foliage leaves and measure 0.8 to 1.4 cm long. In Arundinaria, each new culm is topped with a fan-shaped cluster of leaves called a top knot. In A. appalachiana these consist of 6 to 12 leaves that are 9 to 22.5 cm in length by 1.4 to 2.8 cm in width and are linear (i.e. long and narrow), lanceolate (i.e. lance-shaped; slightly wider in the middle), or ovate-lanceolate (i.e. intermediate between egg-shaped and lance-shaped). The primary branches are erect, terete and typically no longer than 35 cm long. The bases of the primary branches contain between 2 and 5 compressed internodes and secondary branching does not occur at these basal areas. The foliage leaves are deciduous and their blades are typically 5 to 20 cm long by 0.8 to 2 cm wide. The blades have rounded bases and are chartaceous (i.e. paper-like). Their abaxial surfaces (i.e. undersides) show weak cross veining and are pilose (i.e. covered with fine, soft hairs) or glabrous (hairless), while the adaxial surfaces (i.e. upper sides) are always pilose. The ligules (i.e. a thin outgrowth at the meeting of the leaf and its sheath) are either glabrous or ciliate (i.e. fringed with hairs), lacerate (i.e. jagged) or fimbriate (i.e. fringed). The spikelets, the inflorescence found on all grasses, measure 3 to 5.5 cm in length and are typically a subtle reddish- purple in colour. Each spikelet contains 5 to 8 florets. Flowering is currently very poorly understood. During the research done on the plant by Triplett, Weakley and Clark when describing the species, only one flowering specimen was encountered. While flowering is rare in most bamboos, this evidence suggests that it may be even less common in hill cane. Distribution and habitat Arundinaria appalachiana is native to the southern Appalachian Mountains and upper Piedmont of the southeastern US in the western Carolinas, southeastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and northeastern Alabama. It is found at elevations ranging from 300 to 800 metres, though sometimes up to 1065 metres. Its most typical habitat is on dry to somewhat mesic upland slopes, but it can also be found less typically in somewhat moister soils, next to spring seeps or along small streams.

Geography  It is located on a plateau at 760 m over the sea level, on the road from municipal seat Foligno to Macerata, which houses a total of c. 5,000 inhabitants (part of it is under the jurisdiction of Serravalle di Chienti, Marche). The village contains Umbria's smallest natural park.  History  In the plateau tombs from the 10th century BC and an Iron Age village (9th century BC) have been found. In 178 BC existed here the Roman city of Plestia, which had a forum, a temple and other edifices and shortly was a bishopric. The town was abandoned in the 10th century: the site is now marked by the church of Santa Maria in Plestia. The area was repopulated by the comune of Foligno, who built here the castle (1269) from which originated the modern village. Colfiorito was heavily damaged by the earthquake which rocked Umbria and Marche regions on September 26, 1997.  Ecclesiastical History  In the 5th century AD a Bishopric of Plestia was established, which was suppressed in 560, its territory being reassigned to the Diocese of Camerino. In 950 it was restored as Diocese of Plestia, regaining its territory from the above bishopric of Camerino. In 1006 it was again suppressed, its territory now being divided between the then dioceses of Spoleto, Foligno and Nocera Umbra.

Fein has written numerous articles on constitutional issues for The Washington Times, Slate.com, The New York Times, The Huffington Post and Legal Times, and is active on civil liberties issues. He has worked for the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation, both conservative think tanks, as an analyst and commentator. Fein is a principal in a government affairs and public relations firm, The Lichfield Group, in Washington, D.C.. He is also a resident scholar at the Turkish Coalition of America. Early life Fein graduated from Ellwood P. Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, California in 1965, where he was a starting guard on the basketball team. He attended Swarthmore College, and then transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he was the starting guard for the California Golden Bears men's basketball team. Fein received his Juris Doctor (JD) from Harvard Law School in 1972. Fein is the brother of Dan Fein, a prominent figure in the Socialist Workers Party and former candidate for governor of Illinois and mayor of New York City. Personal life Bruce Fein married Mattie Lolavar on May 15, 2004. The two were divorced in June 2013. Relations with the US Government Fein was a top Justice Department official under the Ronald Reagan administration. He has criticized the Bush, Clinton and Obama presidencies. =Reagan Administration= Under President Ronald Reagan, Fein served as an Associate Deputy Attorney General from 1981 to 1982 and as general counsel to the Federal Communications Commission. During that period, he wrote an extensive 30-page critique of Times v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court ruling that freed American media from much of its liability under libel law in the United States. That memorandum was briefly misattributed to Judge John Roberts while his nomination to be Chief Justice of the United States was pending. In 1987, he served as the minority (minority party) research director of the committee in the United States House of Representatives that investigated the Iran- Contra Affair. =Criticizing Bush, Clinton and Obama= The George W. Bush administration's terrorist surveillance program, which intercepted some communications without a warrant from the FISA court, incensed him enough to propose censure or even impeachment of Bush. He ridiculed Harriett Miers's Supreme Court nomination, and was sharply criticical of then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. In March 2007, he founded the American Freedom Agenda with Bob Barr, David Keene and Richard Viguerie. Notable published writings by Fein include articles advocating the impeachment of former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney. On September 2, 2008, Fein addressed Ron Paul's \\"Rally For The Republic\\" in Minneapolis, offering a critique of the Bush administration's interventionist policy and advocating a more non-interventionist foreign policy. Fein also harshly criticized the anti-terror policies of the Bush White House, including wiretapping and detention of terror suspects. In April 2009, Fein criticized President Barack Obama for declining to prosecute Bush administration officials for composing CIA memos justifying torture during interrogations. In 2011, Fein proposed impeaching President Barack Obama in connection with the 2011 military intervention in Libya.http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0411/GOP_lawyer_circulates_Obama_impeachment_articles.html?showallhttp://www.politico.com/static/PPM186_articlesofimpeachment_040611.html During the transition following the 2016 election of Donald Trump, the Supreme Court decision in Korematsu v. United States was suggested as offering possible support for implementing his policies targeting all Muslims in the United States. Fein argued that subsequent revelations that the Court was misled, changes in attitudes, and notably the Congress passing the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 in which it apologized for the nation and made reparations for internment of Japanese Americans, history has in effect overturned the Korematsu decision. While the Supreme Court has not actually overturned Korematsu, Harvard University's Noah Feldman has came to the same conclusion, declaring that \\"Korematsu's uniquely bad legal status means it's not precedent even though it hasn't been overturned.\\" Both made arguments in line with Richard Primus' notion of \\"Anti-Canon\\" cases, those which have come to be seen as exemplars of faulty legal reasoning and / or decision making, with Feldman comparing Korematsu to Plessy v. Ferguson and Fein stating that it has \\"joined Dred Scott as an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry.\\" Repeal of the \\"Fairness Doctrine\\" As general counsel to the F.C.C. in the 1980s, Fein re-examined the legal foundations of the Commission's Fairness Doctrine that originated as a Commission rule in 1948. He concluded that the Doctrine was not required by statute, and that the Commission was authorized to repeal the Doctrine by a rulemaking that demonstrated that it chilled the speech of broadcasters on controversial issues in contravention of the First Amendment. The rulemaking culminated in repeal in 1987, which was sustained by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A congressional initiative to re-impose the Doctrine by statute was vetoed by President Reagan. The repeal of the Fairness Doctrine gave birth to a thriving talk radio industry. Clinton Impeachment Fein collaborated with Georgia Congressman Bob Barr in drafting articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice. He authored scores of articles and made many media appearances explaining why President Clinton's conduct satisfied the constitutional standard of \\"high crimes and misdemeanors.\\" Fein argued that the two articles of impeachment voted by the House of Representatives against President Clinton did not pivot on lying about sex. They rested on the President's disrespect for the rule of law, including lying under oath during civil litigation and a grand jury proceeding. United States District Judge Susan Webber Wright later found President Clinton guilty of contempt of court for lying under oath in the Paula Jones litigation, and fined him $90,000. He also agreed to surrender his license to practice law. Lon Snowden In the summer of 2013, Fein was hired by Lon Snowden, father of fugitive ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden. However, Edward Snowden subsequently made clear that Fein did not represent him, explaining that certain comments about his relationship with Glenn Greenwald were misattributed as his own, rather than properly attributed to either Fein or Snowden's father.  NSA lawsuit  In January 2014, Rand Paul announced he was filing a class-action suit against the Obama Administration over the warrantless surveying the PRISM program allowed the National Security Administration to utilize. A controversy was stirred by the reporting that the lawsuit was drafted by Fein, but his name was replaced with Ken Cuccinelli's, the lead counsel on the lawsuit. Mattie Fein, Fein's ex-wife and spokeswoman, told a Washington Post reporter that \\"Ken Cuccinelli stole the suit,\\" and that Rand Paul \\"already has one plagiarism issue, now has a lawyer who just takes another lawyer's work product.\\" Paul's PAC refuted these claims by producing an email from Fein stating that his ex-wife did not speak for him and that he was paid for his work. Hillary Clinton During the 2016 election Fein had been critical of Hillary Clinton on foreign policy,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-fein/a-vote-for-hillary- clinto_b_11879812.html and argues on The Huffington Post that she is too eager for war.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-fein/hillary-clintons- enthusia_b_12072652.html Discussing genocide =Sri Lankan Civil War= Fein has acted \\"on behalf of Tamils Against Genocide\\" related to espouse their cause‚Äîthat is, to present parts of the Sri Lankan Civil War as Tamil genocide. It included attempts to bring criminal charges against some American citizens who are prominent members of the Sri Lankan government. =Armenian Genocide= Fein has penned several articles on the topic, including in The Washington Times and The Huffington Post\\"Armenia Crime Amnesia?\\", The Washington Times, October 16, 2007 where he states no racial, ethnic or religious motivation for the Armenian Genocide ever existed. Court cases His first action as a lawyer was to participate, in the name of the Assembly of Turkish American Associations to the court case against Mourad Topalian, sentenced in 2001 for illegal storing of war weapons and explosives, linked to the Justice Commandos against Armenian Genocide.Memorandum or Letter of the Assembly of Turkish American Associations in Aid of Sentencing in the Nature of a Victims' Statement Together with David Saltzman, he represented Armenian Genocide denier Guenter Lewy in an action against the Southern Poverty Law Center. After filing a complaint,http://www.taldf.com/complaint.pdf the TALDF obtained a public statement of retraction and apologies from SPLC, and a monetary compensation to Prof. Lewy. Fein is also one of the attorneys for Rep. Jean Schmidt, another Armenian Genocide denier, in action against David Krikorian; and of the TCA against University of Minnesota. The House Ethics Committee recently found that Fein had misled Schmidt by failing to disclose to her that his fees in connection with the litigation against David Krikorian were being paid by the TCA.  Trump impeachment articles  In late 2019, with Donald Trump impeachment hearings under way, Fein appeared on the Ralph Nader Radio Hour, presenting thirteen articles of impeachment. The articles include: contempt of Congress, violation of the Emoluments Clause, abuse of presidential powers and of the public trust, soliciting a foreign contribution and bribery, and suppression of free speech. Books * \\"American Empire: Before the Fall\\" Published by Campaign for Liberty, June 2010. American Empire: Before the Fall, the most recent of Fein's published works, condemns what it calls \\"the aggressive foreign policy of the United States\\" for being devoid of concrete objectives, and as such, doomed to war in perpetuity. According to Fein, foreign policy as it stands is earmarked by domination for the sake of domination and gaping wounds to the rule of law and separation of powers. Fein writes: \\"The larger national motivation is to dominate the world for the excitement of domination. The narrower particular motivation of the President is to reduce coequal branches of government to vassalage, to place the President above the law, and to justify secret government without accountability. James Madison's admonitions about presidential wars have been vindicated.\\" Campaign for Liberty commissioned and published American Empire: Before the Fall. This was their first foray into the realm of publishing.

Jones, Jr., are prominent political figures who so far have publicly declared their concurrence with Fein's analysis. * \\"Constitutional Peril: The Life and Death Struggle for Our Constitution and Democracy\\" Published by Palgrave MacMillan, September 16, 2008. Constitutional Peril was the first book authored by Fein intended for the general public. It was published while President Bush remained in office in 2008, and it made an impassioned argument in favor of impeachment for the President's unparalleled expansion of executive authority and multiple defilements of the rule of law. Fein's argument was presented on national television programs including Bill Moyers' Journal.https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/07132007/profile.html, Bill Moyers, PBS Ron Paul is among the most notable consistent proponents of Fein's political commentary.

The second ship named after the city in Wisconsin, the ship was constructed by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company of San Diego, California. The LST was launched in 1970 and was commissioned in 1971. Racine was assigned to the United States west coast and deployed to the western Pacific Ocean during the Vietnam War. The ship was transferred to the Naval Reserve Force in 1981. The LST was decommissioned in 1993 and placed in reserve. Racine was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 2008 and after an attempted sale to Peru failed, was discarded as a target ship during a sinking exercise in July 2018. Design and description Racine was a which were designed to meet the goal put forward by the United States amphibious forces to have a tank landing ship (LST) capable of over . However, the traditional bow door form for LSTs would not be capable. Therefore, the designers of the Newport class came up with a design of a traditional ship hull with a aluminum ramp slung over the bow supported by two derrick arms. The ramp was capable of sustaining loads up to . This made the Newport class the first to depart from the standard LST design that had been developed in early World War II. The LST had a displacement of when light and at full load. Racine was long overall and over the derrick arms which protruded past the bow. The vessel had a beam of , a draft forward of and at the stern at full load. Racine was fitted with six EMD 16-645-ES diesel engines turning two shafts, three to each shaft. The system was rated at and gave the ship a maximum speed of for short periods and could only sustain for an extended length of time. The LST carried of diesel fuel for a range of at the cruising speed of . The ship was also equipped with a bow thruster to allow for better maneuvering near causeways and to hold position while offshore during the unloading of amphibious vehicles. The Newport class were larger and faster than previous LSTs and were able to transport tanks, heavy vehicles and engineer groups and supplies that were too large for helicopters or smaller landing craft to carry. The LSTs have a ramp forward of the superstructure that connects the lower tank deck with the main deck and a passage large enough to allow access to the parking area amidships. The vessels are also equipped with a stern gate to allow the unloading of amphibious vehicles directly into the water or to unload onto a utility landing craft (LCU) or pier. At either end of the tank deck there is a turntable that permits vehicles to turn around without having to reverse. The Newport class has the capacity for of vehicles, of cargo area and could carry up to 431 troops. The vessels also have davits for four vehicle and personnel landing craft (LCVPs) and could carry four pontoon causeway sections along the sides of the hull. Racine was initially armed with four Mark 33 /50 caliber guns in two twin turrets. The vessel was equipped with two Mk 63 gun control fire systems (GCFS) for the 3-inch guns, but these were removed in 1977‚Äì1978. The ship also had SPS-10 surface search radar. Atop the stern gate, the vessels mounted a helicopter deck. They had a maximum complement of 213 including 11 officers.  Construction and career  The LST was ordered as the fourth hull of the third group in Fiscal Year 1967 and a contract was awarded on 15 July 1966.Naval Vessel Register The ship was laid down by the National Steel & Shipbuilding Company, at their yard in San Diego, California on 13 December 1969. Named for the city in Wisconsin, Racine was launched on 15 August 1970, sponsored by the wife of Vice Admiral Edwin B. Hooper. Racine was placed in commission on 9 July 1971. Racine entered service on the west coast of the United States and spent time performing routine tasks along the coast and participating in naval exercises. Beginning in June 1972, the ship was sent on a training cruise to South America before returning to the US in July. On 13 September 1972, the LST was deployed to the western Pacific, transporting troops and supplies between the various US bases there and Vietnam. Racine returned to San Diego on 17 May 1973. The LST returned to the western Pacific in 1974, 1976‚Äì1977, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1980. For service during the Vietnam War, Racine earned one battle star. On 6 November 1979, Racine collided with Li Tung Sol, a small fishing vessel. No injuries were reported. On On 15 January 1981, the LST was transferred to the Naval Reserve Force. Racine was decommissioned on 2 October 1993 was placed in inactive reserve at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 2008. In 2009, there was discussion of a possible sale of ex- and ex- Racine to Peru. This plan did not materialize and ex-Fresno was sunk as a target in 2014. Ex-Racine was listed as \\"disposal by experimental use\\" by Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) in September 2016. On 12 July 2018, ex- Racine was struck by live fire as part of a sinking exercise (SINKEX) involving units from Australia, Japan, and the United States. The ship was sunk by a Harpoon missile fired from a Royal Australian Air Force Boeing P-8A Poseidon and a Mark 48 torpedo from the United States Navy . The torpedo hit the LST amidships, breaking the vessel's keel and sinking it in waters deep, north of Kauai, Hawaii.

Vologda Oblast Government web site He was, however, unable to exit the reactor compartment because the hatch had jammed due to increased pressure, and died. Preminin was posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Star, the medal of Hero of the Russian Federation and the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\". Early life Preminin was born on 18 October 1965 in the village of Skornyakovo in Vologda Oblast, then in the Russian SSR of the Soviet Union. Preminin's father Anatoly was an electrician and his mother Valentina worked in a flax factory. The couple had three sons. Sergei attended school in the city of Krasavino and decided to follow in the footsteps of his older brother Nikolai by graduating from engineering school in Veliky Ustyug in the Vologda Oblast. Naval service On 23 October 1984, Preminin started to serve in the Soviet Navy. Preminin initially underwent a training in a special group in Severodvinsk, after which he started to serve aboard the K-219. =Death= On 3 October 1986, while on patrol northeast of Bermuda, the K-219 suffered an explosion and fire in missile compartment VI. Chicago Tribune, July 23, 1997 Three sailors were killed outright in the explosion. The vessel surfaced to permit its twin nuclear reactors to be shut down. The remaining crew was assigned to the bow or the stern, as far away from the explosion site as possible, and had been issued gas masks. Soon after, the temperature indicator showed a very high temperature at the nuclear reactors, and the flow of coolant in the reactor gradually decreased further. This meant that a meltdown was imminent. However, the reactor shutdown could not proceed as planned from the control station; the trigger of the control rods had been damaged, by either the expanding gases or the intense heat. For this reason, the reactor SCRAM had to be carried out manually, directly into the reactor chamber. This also meant that the men doing this would be exposed to strong radiation, since the on- board contamination coveralls were not designed to protect the sailors from the strong gamma and neutron radiation directly in the vicinity of the reactor core. The officer of the reactor department, Nikolay Belikov, and his subordinate - sailor Sergei Preminin - went into the reactor chamber to complete the reactor SCRAM. They dropped three of four rods, but because of the high temperature (about 70¬∞C or 158¬∞F) Belikov lost consciousness. Preminin had to put the fourth rod in place. This was a job that required great physical strength, as the holders of the rods were now severely deformed by the heat. War Heroes of Russia(in Russian) When he tried to leave the reactor chamber, he could not open the hatch, as a pressure difference had been established between the reactor chamber and the reactor control station. After further attempts from other colleagues to force open the hatch from outside, Preminin died in the hot reactor chamber, as the rest of the crew had to move further towards the rear to escape the poisonous gases that spread out in the boat. In film The sinking of the submarine and Preminin's feat were the subject for the book Hostile Waters, written by Peter Huchthausen, Igor Kurdin and R. Alan White. The BBC produced a television film of the same name in the same year, under the direction of David Drury of Warner Bros. Rob Campbell played the role of Preminin.

N. Seetharam.  Plot details  The movie is a social drama which is based on the universally prevalent divide in society based on money as well as the idea that people do not change, and if they do change, then the society does not allow them to stay changed. Naik, Palegar and Dalavayee are three youths who are children of rich and powerful men in society. They live a carefree life consisting mainly of their debauchery. The film's opening scene shows them openly eve teasing a young girl. When her enraged brother, Purushottham tries to get them to stop, they thrash him and leave. On another occasion, they are shown enjoying a grand meal and alcohol in a restaurant. When an old acquaintance approaches them and requests them to loan him money, they insult him and declare that they would rather throw their money into the garbage than give him a loan. One day, they try to misbehave with Neela, who fights them off and then blackmails their families with dire consequences if they do not acquiesce to her conditions. Her conditions turn out to be severe, she requires them to stay away from the city in a place of her choice for six months. She also specifies that they cannot take more than a hundred rupees each with them. Naik, having fallen for her, agrees in a fit of bravado, believing that this will win her over and his friends follow suit. The place that Neela has selected turns out to be the construction site of a huge dam. The three friends go approach their point of contact believing that they will be given high posts to work and comfortable quarters to stay. They get a rude awakening when they are told that they will be working as laborers and will live in huts like the common people. Initially enraged, they stay on fearing ridicule from Neela if they give up easily. The colony that they live in has characters like Parvathi who lives with her father, Roopli, an orphan who has also been taken care of by Parvathi's father as well as Belli, a blind girl who constantly waits for god to come and restore her sight, having been told by her grandmother that god listens to those who pray. After some initial struggles, the three men get adjusted to the routine and also get along with everyone in their colony. Parvathi falls for Naik while Roopli and Dalavayee fall in love with each other. On receiving their first salary, the men feel proud on having earned it, as well as repentance on their earlier wasteful ways. Meanwhile, Neela who came to gloat before leaving the country to get married, gets a rude shock on seeing that the three men have actually changed visibly. She feels sad on having put them through such troubles and begs them to return before she leaves the country. They however refuse, saying that they stay has actually made them better than they were in the city. The whole colony bids farewell to Neela who rides off into the sunset. Around this point, the newly appointed engineer to the project turns out to be the man they earlier tormented, Purushottham. He threatens to tell the people of the colony about their earlier exploits, but they beg him not to do so fearing that they will fall in the eyes of the simple people who have come to trust them. However, Purushottham does not believe that they have changed and declares that he will keep an eye on them to prove this. He observes Roopli and Dalavayee having a physical relation in secret but stays silent about it. The next day, while the entire colony has gone to work, Palegar tricks an unsuspecting Belli into believing that he is god come to restore her sight and makes her sleep with him. When the people return, Belli's brother bemoans the fact that someone has done this to his innocent sister, while Naik believes that nobody from the colony could have done this. This pricks Palegar into confessing his sin and enrages Naik who proceeds to berate him. Purushottham arrives to further add salt to their wounds by exposing the fact that Dalavayee and Roopli have had a physical relation outside of marriage. In the confusion that follows, both Dalavayee and Palegar declare that they will marry Roopli and Belli respectively while Naik and Parvathi accept their feelings for each other. The crowd disperses, seemingly placated by the fact that the three men will keep their word. Purushottham stays visibly skeptical but keeps mum. In the next scene, Dalavayee's father, a politician and his mother come to see him. On finding out about his relationship with an orphan construction worker, his mother berates him but his father quickly handles the situation by taking his side, promising to take the couple back to the city and get them married, thus earning the cheers of the colony folk. However, after driving away from the dam, he throws Roopli out of the car and proceeds to give her money to forget his son. He also entices Dalavayee to return with him, reminding him of the luxuries of his past life. Dalavayee gives in and returns with his parents after begging Roopli to forget him and promising to send her money each month. Roopli starts laughing maniacally and is brought back to the colony by Purushottham who then incites the crowd against Naik and Palegar who are beaten up by the bloodthirsty men of the colony. After realizing that they have no place in the colony anymore, Naik and Palegar slowly start to walk out but are held back by Parvathi and Belli who have truly come to love them. The colony relents, but does not forgive them for Dalavayee's betrayal. On the start of the monsoon, the project gets suspended and the daily wage workers are left without jobs. Naik and Palegar declare that they will take care of everyone without a job by taking them to the city and keeping them in their homes. They convince the project owner and a reluctant Purushottham to make the people go with them to the city. Naik takes the entire group to his house while Palegar takes Belli to his house. Naik's family refuses to acknowledge him and the people while he innocently makes them settle in his house. His father, brother and sister in law walk out of the house in a huff but his mother takes his side and appreciates his choice of a fianc√© in Parvathi. Meanwhile, Palegar's father has been made the chairman of a disabled institution. He ironically refuses to accept his son marrying a blind girl and throws both of them out. Naik tries to convince Dalavayee to take Roopli back but Dalavayee's marriage has been fixed to a rich man's daughter who has promised him an imported car as a gift. However, the plight of Roopli and the people he stayed with makes him change his mind and he decides to convince his parents. Naik takes Palegar and Belli and returns to his house to find that all his guests have been thrown out by his family with a warning that the police will be called in case they try to reenter the house. Naik storms in and fights with his father, brother and sister in law while his mother remains a mute spectator. Dalavayee tries to reason with his parents about accepting Roopli as his wife but his parents, disappointed that they will not be getting the assured gifts from his arranged marriage disinherit him and throw him out at gunpoint. Roopli tries to make him leave her and go back to his parents but he rushes back in and shoots them with the same gun. He then tells Roopli to enjoy the few moments they have together before he gets arrested. At Naik's house, his family makes it clear that they want nothing to do with him or his group with the exception of his mother who declares that she is proud of him for his ideals, but goes back inside eventually. The police are called and in the melee that follows, Palegar goes after a running Belli to fall under a speeding truck. He dies after voicing his last wish to have his eyes donated to Belli and requesting Naik to make her see the good that the world has to offer. Naik, who is visibly crushed, cradles the head of his dead friend and questions aloud as to why is god being so cruel with them to which a disembodied voice replies that God is not cruel. It is the society instead, who is cruel, having made divisions based on caste, status, language and other differences. The movie ends with the voice saying that these forces in the society have made people forget about the true purpose of life, happiness.  Themes and Characterizations  Puttanna Kanagal brilliantly scripted a story which has themes prevalent in society to this day. He shows the exuberance of youth fueled by the arrogance of riches. He also brings out the directionless, impressionable youth who rush to find the next interesting thing in life and changing their stance repeatedly. This is seen by the quick turnarounds in behavior of the three protagonists and the way in which Naik quickly gets over Neela, who was the catalyst for his change to settle for Parvathi who loves him. Dalavayee's oscillations in wanting to live a comfortable life with his parents and wanting to be with Roopli also strengthen the theme. The main moral, however seems to be the fact that people don't change and that society does not allow people to change, in addition to the obvious divide between the rich and the poor. Initially, the parents of the protagonists are quick to send them away fearing retribution from Neela will spoil their reputation. However, it is the same parents who would rather have their children back as is rather than children whose minds have undergone a change for the better. Also, when the three men repeatedly try to convince Purushottham of their improvement in behavior, he stays skeptical and is immediately justified when Dalavayee and Palegar succumb to their carnal instincts, indicating that lack of positive reinforcement from the society led to them reverting to their old ways. Belli, the blind girl, paints an image of pure innocence or madness induced by misfortune. Her constant begging of god to restore her sight, as well has her referring to Palegar as god shows that when people experience misery at its worst, they will clutch on to whatever little thing that gives them hope. The main character Naik, comes across as a picture of naivety in the harsh reality of the society. He constantly clamors for approval from people around him for his actions and his attempts to be seen as a changed man keep getting more and more desperate as he frenziedly fights for what he believes is right. An apt picturization which shows the misguided youth, society enforcing structure by force and the repercussions happening to anyone who tries to go against the flow. Naik means leader, Dalavayee means commander and Palegar means landlord. However, in this movie, the leader fights a lost cause, the commander lacks conviction in his decisions and the lord stays blind to his desires. This play on words stays with you long after the movie ends. Soundtrack The music was composed by Vijaya Bhaskar, with lyrics by Vijayanarasimha and Siddalingaiah.

It is popularly referred to as the \\"EP Church\\". It has strong roots in the Evangelical and Reformed traditions. The denomination's Presbyterian sister church is the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. History The Evangelical Presbyterian Church Ghana was founded by German missionaries on 14 November 1847 in Peki. These missionaries from the North German Mission Society (Norddeutsche Mission, Bremen), together with the Basel Mission in 1847, started work among the Ewe people in what is now the Volta Region of Ghana. By the beginning of World War I, they had established two mission stations in the British colony of the Gold Coast and seven in the German territory of Togoland. The first of the mission stations was (Mission- Tove) in present-day Togo. After the war, Togoland was divided into two territories, the western one under British rule and the eastern one under French rule. The first synod of the mission stations in May 1922, despite the division of Togoland, declared itself to be the supreme governing body of the \\"Ewe Church\\". The church adopted the congregational order of the Bremen Mission. In 1923, Scottish missionaries began working in British Togo (Transvolta Togoland), which is the present-day Volta Region of Ghana. The church in French Togoland (now Togo) was run by the Paris Mission. As a result, development proceeded separately in the two territories, although both churches share the same constitution. They hold a common synod meeting every 4 years. Belief The EP Church is a Trinitarian church. Church information The EP church has its headquarters at Ho, the capital of the Volta Region of Ghana. It has more than 600,000 members in nearly 750 congregations. The overall leader of the church is known as the Moderator of the General Assembly. The current Moderator of the General Assembly of the church is Rt. Rev. Dr. Seth Senyo Agidi. He succeeded Very Rev. Francis Amenu in 2015, who had been elected as the first Moderator of the General Assembly, which was constituted in 2009. The previous gathering of the churches was known as the General Synod. The last Moderator of the General Synod was Rt. Rev. Dr. L.K Buama, whose term ended in 2009. =Past Moderators= The first Moderator was elected in 1922, when the Togo and Gold Coast branches of the church held their first Joint Synod. *Very Rev.

Intended by Boisavia as a touring aircraft, it did not find a market and only the single prototype was constructed.

This can be contrasted to rolling motion. Both types of motion may occur in bearings. The relative motion or tendency toward such motion between two surfaces is resisted by friction. Friction may damage or 'wear' the surfaces in contact. However, wear can be reduced by lubrication. The science and technology of friction, lubrication, and wear is known as tribology. Sliding may occur between two objects of arbitrary shape, whereas rolling friction is the frictional force associated with the rotational movement of a somewhat disclike or other circular object along a surface. Generally, the frictional force of rolling friction is less than that associated with sliding kinetic friction.Benjamin Silliman, Principles of Physics, Or Natural Philosophy, Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor & company publishers, 710 pages (1871) Typical values for the coefficient of rolling friction are less than that of sliding friction.Hans-J√ºrgen Butt, Karlheinz Graf, Michael Kappl, Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces, Wiley Publishers, 373 pages, (2006) Correspondingly sliding friction typically produces greater sound and thermal bi-products. One of the most common examples of sliding friction is the movement of braking motor vehicle tires on a roadway, a process which generates considerable heat and sound, and is typically taken into account in assessing the magnitude of roadway noise pollution. C. Michael Hogan, Analysis of Highway Noise, Journal of Soil, Air and Water Pollution, Springer Verlag Publishers, Netherlands, Volume 2, Number 3 / September, 1973 Sliding friction Sliding friction (also called kinetic friction) is a contact force that resists the sliding motion of two objects or an object and a surface. Sliding friction is almost always less than that of static friction; this is why it is easier to move an object once it starts moving rather than to get the object to begin moving from a rest position. F_{k} = \\\\mu_{k} \\\\cdot N Where , is the force of kinetic friction. is the coefficient of kinetic friction, and N is the normal force. Examples of sliding friction Slippery when wet signs alert drivers that they need to slow down because the kinetic friction between the tires and a wet surface is much less than that of a dry surface. * Sledding * Pushing an object across a surface * Rubbing one's hands together (The friction force generates heat.) * A car sliding on ice * A car skidding as it turns a corner *Opening a window * Almost any motion where there is contact between an object and a surface  Motion of sliding friction  The motion of sliding friction can be modelled (in simple systems of motion) by Newton's Second Law \\\\sum F = ma F_E - F_k = ma Where F_E is the external force. * Acceleration occurs when the external force is greater than the force of kinetic friction. * Slowing Down (or Stopping) occurs when the force of kinetic friction is greater than that of the external force.  This also follows Newton's first law of motion as there exists a net force on the object. * Constant Velocity occurs when there is no net force on the object, that is the external force is equal to force of kinetic friction. = Motion on an inclined plane = Free body diagram for a block subject to friction as it slides on an incline plane A common problem presented in introductory physics classes is a block subject to friction as it slides up or down an inclined plane. This is shown in the free body diagram to the right. The component of the force of gravity in the direction of the incline is given by: F_g = mg\\\\sin{\\\\theta} The normal force (perpendicular to the surface) is given by: N = mg\\\\cos{\\\\theta} Therefore, since the force of friction opposes the motion of the block, F_k =\\\\mu_k \\\\cdot mg\\\\cos{\\\\theta} To find the coefficient of kinetic friction on an inclined plane, one must find the moment where the force parallel to the plane is equal to the force perpendicular; this occurs when the block is moving at a constant velocity at some angle \\\\theta \\\\sum F = ma = 0 F_k = F_g or \\\\mu_k mg\\\\cos{\\\\theta} = mg\\\\sin{\\\\theta} Here it is found that: \\\\mu_k = \\\\frac{mg\\\\sin{\\\\theta}}{mg\\\\cos{\\\\theta}} = \\\\tan{\\\\theta} where \\\\theta is the angle at which the block begins moving at a constant velocity  References  Category:Classical mechanics ","title":"Sliding (motion)"},{"id":"12253902","text":"Katarina Br√§nnstr√∂m, born in 1950, is a Swedish politician of the Moderate Party.

The governorate was formed in 1772, in the aftermath of the First partition of Poland, from parts of the voivodeships of Witebsk, M≈õcis≈Çaw, Po≈Çock and Inflanty. Parts of these territories were also used to form the Pskov Governorate. In 1796, Mogilev and Polotsk Governorates were united and formed Belorussian Governorate. In 1802, Belorussian Governorate was divided into Vitebsk Governorate and Mogilev Governorate. In 1917, Vitebsk, Mogilev and parts of Minsk Governorate and Vilna Governorate were united into the Western District (from 1918 known as Western Komuna). In 1918, it was joined by Smolensk Governorate and in October 1919, Mogilev Governorate was reformed into Gomel Governorate.http://www.jewishgen.org/Belarus/grodno/distcent.htm Subdivisions * Bykhovsky Uyezd * Gomelsky Uyezd * Goretsky Uyezd * Klimovichskiy Uyezd * Mogilyovsky Uyezd * Mstislavsky Uyezd * Orshansky Uyezd * Rogachyovsky Uyezd * Sennensky Uyezd * Chaussky Uyezd * Cherikovsky Uyezd References External links * Maps and lists of settlements of Mogilev Governorate Category:Governorates of the Russian Empire Category:States and territories established in 1772 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1919 Category:History of Mogilev Category:Former subdivisions of Belarus Category:1772 establishments in the Russian Empire Category:1919 disestablishments in Russia ","title":"Mogilev Governorate"},{"id":"12253924","text":"The B√∂lkow Bo 46 was a West German experimental helicopter built to test the Derschmidt rotor system that aimed to allow much higher speeds than traditional helicopter designs. Wind tunnel testing showed promise, but the Bo 46 demonstrated a number of problems and added complexity that led to the concept being abandoned. The Bo 46 was one of a number of new designs exploring high-speed helicopter flight that were built in the early 1960s. Background Helicopter rotors operate in a much more challenging environment than a normal aircraft propeller. To start with, helicopters normally use the main rotor both for lift and manoeuvrability, whereas fixed- wing aircraft normally use separate surfaces for these tasks. Pitch and yaw are operated by changing the lift on different sides of the rotor, using a system of bell cranks to adjust the blades to different angles of attack as they rotate. To roll to the left, the blades are adjusted so there is slightly more angle of attack on the front and slightly less on the back, resulting in a net upward lift on the right side that rolls the aircraft. The reason the blades are adjusted in the front and back instead of right and left is due to phase lag caused by precession. In forward flight, the rotor system is subject to various forms of differential loading. Imagine a rotor system where the tips of the blades rotate at 300 km/h relative to still air. When that helicopter is hovering, the blades see the same 300 km/h relative wind throughout their rotation. However, when the helicopter starts to move forward its speed is added to the speed of the blades as they advance towards the front of the aircraft, and subtracted as they retreat. For instance, if the helicopter is flying forward at 100 km/h, the advancing blades see 300 + 100 km/h = 400 km/h, and for the retreating ones its 300 ‚Äì 100 km/h = 200 km/h. In this example, the relative airspeed changes by a factor of two during every rotation. Lift is a function of the angle of the airfoil to the relative airflow combined with the speed of the air. To counteract this change in lift, which would normally pitch the aircraft, the rotor system has to dynamically adjust the angle of the airfoils to ensure they generate a steady amount of lift throughout their motion. This adjustment is in addition to any that is being applied deliberately to manoeuvre. Since every control system has some mechanical limit, as the aircraft speeds up it loses manoeuvrability. Drag is a function of the square of airspeed, so the same changes in speed cause the drag to vary by a factor of four. To reduce the net force as much as possible, helicopter blades are designed to be as thin as possible, reducing their drag, although this makes them inefficient for lift. In the 1950s, helicopter blades were made in much the same fashion as fixed-wing aircraft wings; a spar ran the length of the rotor blade and provided most of the structural strength, while a series of stringers give it the proper aerodynamic shape. This method of construction, given the materials of the era, placed enormous stresses on the spar. To lessen the loads, especially the rapid changes, the rotor hubs included a system of bearings that allow them to move forward or back in response to drag, and up and down in a flapping motion in response to changing speed. These were in addition to the system used to change the angle of attack to provide control; rotor hubs tended to be very complex. Performance limits From an elementary aeronautical point of view, there exists two main problems regarding the maximum airspeed of a helicopter as imposed by its rotor system. All wings require a certain amount of air to flow over its surface in order to generate lift. The inherent flight mechanics of a helicopter not at hover will result in a portion of the rotating blade disk to \\"see\\" a lower airspeed relative to the direction of travel. As the speed of the fuselage in the commanded direction increases, there will be a decrease in relative airspeed of the retreating blades. A conventional helicopter will reach a hard limit in terms of maximum speed when the relative airspeed of the retreating blades decays to near zero thus resulting in retreating blade stall. One solution to this problem is to increase the rotor rpm so that the relative airspeed of the retreating blades are higher. However, this solution also has its limits. As any airfoil approaches the speed of sound it encounters a problem known as wave drag. Airfoils designed for subsonic flight will experience a significant increase in drag if they are subjected to transonic or higher airspeeds. If the rotor rpm were to be increased in an attempt to alleviate retreating blade stall, the helicopter will face a maximum speed induced by extreme drag of the rotor' advancing blades as their tips approach supersonic relative airspeed. Thus, in summary; If main rotor rpm is too low, the speed at which the retreating blade sections stall will be the maximum speed limit. If the main rotor rpm is too high, the speed at which the advancing blades encounter supersonic airflow would be the maximum speed limit. Even to the casual observer it should be clear that the designer should aim for a balance between these two limits. It should also be mentioned that in addition to these two addressed issues, there are a host of others which also contribute to maximum airspeed limits. Derschmidt's solution The basic problem inherent in rotor design is the difference in airspeed for the advancing and retreating blades. Among the many effects this causes is one of interest; the blades rotate forward and backward around the hub as drag increases and decreases. Consider a blade as it reaches the rear of the aircraft and starts to rotate forward; during this time the relative airspeed starts increasing rapidly, and the blade is pushed further and further back by the increasing drag. This force is absorbed in a drag bearing. During the brief period while it rotates around this bearing, the overall speed of the blade is decreased, slightly offsetting the speed due to forward motion.Derschmidt 1955, col 1 Derschmidt's rotor design deliberately exaggerates this rotation to offset the increase and decrease in speed throughout the blade's rotation. At the same point of rotation as the traditional blade above, a Derschmidt rotor has advanced the blade considerably to an angle of about 40 degrees compared to its rest position straight out from the hub. As the blade continues advancing, a linkage swings the blade from 40 degrees forward to 40 degrees rearward, slowing the tip by about 1/2 the rotational speed. This process is reversed as the blade reaches its forward-most position, increasing the speed of the blade as it retreats. The resulting motion helps smooth out the relative airspeed seen by the blade. Since the effects of the forward motion of the helicopter are reduced, or even eliminated at lower speeds, the rotor can be spun at a high speed without fear of reaching the wave drag regime. At the same time, the speed of the retreating blade never approaches the stall point. Likewise, changes in drag are even more reduced, to the point of being negligible. This allows the Derschmidt rotor to be a rigid design, eliminating the complex series of bearings, flexible fittings and linkages used in conventional rotors. Since the motion in the Derschmidt rotor follows the natural change in drag through the rotation, the force applied to the blades to move them into position is quite small. Of the several designs he presented in his early patents, most used a very small linkage from a bell crank on the inner side of the blade attached to a small pushrod for operation. These rods were attached to a disk set eccentrically to the centre of rotation, which drove the blades into their proper locations. Last in the series of designs was a different approach that used a single counterweight for each blade, geared so its motion was mechanically amplified. The weight was selected to create a harmonic pendulum at the rotor's design speed. There was no mechanical attachment between the blades, and the entire assembly sat outside the hub, leaving ample room for maintenance. Bo 46 B√∂lkow had been interested in high-speed rotor flight for some time, and had drawn up several experimental concepts based on tip jet systems. Later they took on the job of developing a glass-fibre composite blade that was much stronger than the existing metal designs.Taylor 1963, pg. 131 When Derschmidt received his first patent in 1955, B√∂lkow took up the concept and started work on the B√∂lkow Bo 46 as an experimental testbed, paid for by a Ministry of Defence contract.Taylor 1963, pg. 132 The basic Bo 46 design was finalized in January 1959. The five-bladed rotor system was initially tested in a wind tunnel and turned in impressive results. These suggested that the Bo 46 would be able to reach speeds up to ; even advanced designs of the era were limited to speeds around . Construction of three highly streamlined fuselages started at Siebel. There were powered by an 800 hp Turbom√©ca Turmo turboshaft driving a five-bladed Derschmidt rotor. The design originally featured a louvred fenestration for the anti-torque rotor that could be closed in high speed flight, but this was removed from the prototypes and the six-bladed rotor was conventionally mounted on the left side of the tail. The maximum speed was not limited by rotor considerations, but the maximum power of the engine.Report 1963, pg. 911 Adding separate engines for additional forward thrust was expected to allow speeds as high as . During the early 1960s the company also outlined several production designs, most using twin rotors, the largest of these was the Bo 310. This design would be powered by two T55 or T64 engines, each of which drove both a Derschmidt rotor and a forward-facing propeller for additional forward thrust. The engines would be on the ends of an aerofoil section to reduce the rotor loading. Several versions of the Bo 310 were modelled, mostly passenger transports, but also attack helicopter versions. The Bo 310 would have a cruise speed of . Initial test flights of the Bo 46 with the rotors locked started in the autumn of 1963. In testing a series of unexpected new types of dynamic loads were encountered, which led to dangerous oscillations in the rotor. These did not appear to be inherent to the design itself, but they could only be cured through additional complexity in the rotor. During the same period, rotor design was moving to composite blades that were much stronger than the older spar-and-stringer designs, which eliminated the need for the complex bearing system that relieved loads. Although the Derschmidt rotor still improved performance, it appeared the added complexity was not worthwhile. Interest in the system waned, but research flights continued. The Bo 46 was eventually equipped with two Turbom√©ca Marbor√© engines, allowing a speed of 400 km/h. The fibreglass bladed rotor proved to be workable however, and would go on to see wide service in the B√∂lkow Bo 105.  Logbook Entries of Test Pilot  The flight test pilot of the Bo 46 was Wilfried von Engelhardt. His log book entries are as follows: * February 14, 1964: first attempt to lift off * October 27, 1964: four successful hovers, duration in total 3 minutes * October 28, 1964: four successful hovers. Duration in total 18 minutes. Note that the helicopter can be controlled but is sluggish * October 29, 1964: two landings from higher than 3 Meters. In total 13 minutes of flight time.

The exhibitions were instrumental in furthering the understanding of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht in Germany. Both exhibitions were produced by the Hamburg Institute for Social Research (Hamburger Institut f√ºr Sozialforschung); the first under the title \\"War of Annihilation. Crimes of the Wehrmacht 1941 to 1944\\" (Vernichtungskrieg. Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941 bis 1944), which opened in Hamburg on 5 March 1995 and travelled to 33 German and Austrian cities. It was the subject of a terrorist attack but the organizers nonetheless claimed it had been attended by 800,000 visitors. The second exhibition ‚Äì which was first shown in Berlin in November 2001 ‚Äì attempted to dissipate considerable controversy generated by the first exhibition according to the Institute. History The popular and controversial travelling exhibition was seen by an estimated 1.2 million visitors over the last decade. Using written documents from the era and archival photographs, the organizers had shown that the Wehrmacht was \\"involved in planning and implementing a war of annihilation against Jews, prisoners of war, and the civilian population\\". Historian Hannes Heer and Gerd Hankel had prepared it. The view of the \\"unblemished\\" Wehrmacht was shaken by the material evidence put on public display in different cities including Hamburg, Munich, Berlin, Bielefeld, Vienna, and Leipzig. On 9 March 1999 at 4:40am, a bomb attack on the exhibition occurred in Saarbr√ºcken, damaging the adult high school building housing the exhibition and the adjoining Schlosskirche church. Criticism and review Counterdemonstration against B√ºrgerbewegung gegen die Wehrmachtsausstellung, in Munich, 2002 After criticisms about incorrect attribution such as pictures of Soviet atrocities wrongly attributed to Germans and captioning of some of the images in the exhibition, e.g. by Polish-born historian Bogdan Musia≈Ç and Hungarian historian Kriszti√°n Ungv√°ry, the head and founder of the Hamburg Institute for Social Research, Jan Philipp Reemtsma suspended the display, pending review of its content by a committee of historians. After the review 20 out of 1400 pictures were found to be of Soviet atrocities. The committee's report in 2000 stated that accusations of forged materials were not justified, but that some of the exhibit's documentation had inaccuracies and that the arguments presented were too sweeping. In a written statement, Reemtsma said: In its report from November 2000, the committee reaffirmed the reliability of the exhibition in general, explaining that the errors had already been corrected. The committee recommended that the exhibition be expanded to include perspectives of the victims as well, presenting the material but leaving the conclusions to the viewers. Notably, the exhibition does not inform about the Wehrmacht's crimes in occupied Poland on either side of the Curzon Line. They were presented later as an entirely different exposition called Gr√∂√üte H√§rte: Verbrechen der Wehrmacht in Polen September/Oktober 1939 (Crimes of the Wehrmacht in Poland, September/October 1939) by the Deutsches Historisches Institut Warschau.Gr√∂√üte H√§rte ‚Ä¶ Verbrechen der Wehrmacht in Polen September/Oktober 1939 Revised exhibition, 2001‚Äì2004 The revised exhibition was renamed Verbrechen der Wehrmacht.

It focused on public international law and travelled from 2001 to 2004. Since then, it has been moved permanently to the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin.

The Red Raiders had their first victory over a top 25 team since the 2009 season with a January 15, 2014 upset over the #9 Iowa State Cyclones.

Its administrative center is the urban-type settlement of Onufriivka. Population: .  Geography  The area is located in the northeastern part of Kirovohrad Oblast. The territory area is bordered to the north by Poltava Oblast, to the east by Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, to the southwest by Oleksandriia Raion and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and to the west by Svitlovodsk Raion. The territory of the raion is 889 km ¬≤ (3,6% of area). Onufriivka is the administrative center.  History  The oldest traces of human existence in Onufriivka area date from the Neolithic era. The district center, being the town of Onufriivka, was founded in the early 17th century. The settlement was named after Zaporizhzhya Cossack Onufriyenko. At the time of the liberation war of Ukrainian people in 1648-1654 there was already a considerable settlement, the inhabitants of which took part in the campaigns of Bohdan Khmelnytsky. The population Onufriivka grew when farming refugees from Volhynia, Galicia, and Bessarabia arrived, who were drawn by the large amounts of virgin wilderness, forests, rivers and magnificent meadows. Local residents mainly involved in less advanced livestock farming. Fairs were held every year in autumn, when merchants from Kremenchug and Kiev visited the town. In 1752, military settlements were established and Onufriivka joined the New Serbia and became the property of Ivan Horvath-Otkurtycha, and in the 1770s, descendants of Horvath-Otkurtycha sold Onufriivka to Mikhail Ivanovich Kamburley who was a counselor, senator, civil governor of Volhynia. In winter, 1805, the landowner I. Kamburley removed serfs from their estates in Orel and Tambov provinces. Later, he won ten families in a game of cards with a castle-wall keeper, and other serfs traded in a Prince for a thoroughbred dog. He posted these settlers on his lands, establishing the village of Kamburliyivka (in honor of his name) and Zybkove. Today these villages where inhabitants are living descendants of immigrants from Russia is officially Russian territory. The village of Vyshnivtsi (formerly Ivanivka) appeared in 1777. Landowner M. Kamburley explorers in Zaporizhzhya officers Holodiya, bought for 30 rubles. Silver captive Tatar Peter Sahaydysha, baptised him married to Ukrainian and settled on the farm. Next to the Farm in 1792, Kamburleya instructed the settlement of several immigrant families from Poland. Thus arose a village in honor of his father, a landlord called Ivanivna. In 1821, the after the death M. Kamburley his entire Kamburleya property passed into the possession of Count Michael D. Tolstoy, who was married to Kamburley's daughter Kamburleya Kateryna. Count Tolstoy inherited the villages of Onufriivka, Kamburliyivka, Lozuvatka, Ivanivka, i.e. 13 thousand acres of land. The Tolstoy line was rich and ancient, as evidenced by family coat of arms with the motto: ¬´–ü—Ä–µ–¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –∏ —É—Å–µ—Ä–¥–∏–µ–º¬ª.(¬´Dedication and diligence¬ª) Mykhailo D. Tolstoy was a large landowner and implemented on their land advanced methods of management, the savings were used at that time purely on equipment, iron plows, threshing and winnow horse. There was even a tractor, \\"Fordzon.\\" On the farm award-winning horses were bred, which proved to be popular in Russia and abroad. They also reared breeds of sheep rambulye (8 thousand units) and gray Ukrainian cows (600 goals). The wool from the sheep was sent to Bialystok and Lodz wool factory. At the height of its power the town had its own brick factory, and all buildings on the estate were built from their own brick, which became a mark of high quality, especially in 1911. Through donations from the Tolstoy family (MM Tolstoy and his mother OG Tolstoy) a school was built, in which children spent time studying and striving towards an attractive appearance as well as inner sense and beauty. Hospitals and schools were also built in the village of Pavlysh, and a Township Board, veterinaries, vicarage, Zemstvo in Onufriivka. The Tolstoy family also founded Onufriivka park. One of the disciples of the famous Russian scientist Dokuchaev led the work. All work was carried out by the hands of the multitude of serfs of Count Tolstoy. Old Park counts its age from 20 years of 19th century. And a half century later a new addition was made to the south of the river Omelnychok. The area of the park is 84 hectares, of which 22 hectares are water mirror ponds. On its territory there were more than 100 species of trees and shrubs, original pavilions, bridges, small architectural forms, and bulk island with gazebo and bathing, Beside the house are two pools with fountains and a rose garden. The path through the park was based on the classic British model. Farmers were strictly forbidden to enter the manor park. The only workers permitted were those who cleared the alley and those who looked after the trees and numerous gardens, as well as the swans on the park ponds. Later, the villagers were allowed to take water for their needs from one of the ponds. The whole park was surrounded by a two-meter tall brick fence with a decorative lattice on top. In 1960, the Council of Ministers UkrSSR adopted a Resolution, in which Onufriivka park was declared a monument of landscape architecture of the 19th century. From his former savings Count Tolstoy founded stables Number 175 - a regular participant in National and International equestrian sports competitions. His students - English thoroughbred horses - became Olympic champions, winners of large and small Derbys and winners of competitions on the Rostov and Odessa racetracks. The Tolstoy family were among the prominent philanthropists and benefactors of their time. With the backing of Mikhail Mikhailovich an ambulance station was built in Odessa. Each generation were trustees of schools and schools for children from poor families. The counts made a huge contribution to the development of agriculture and viticulture in Southern Russia. After October 1917, the life of the last Count Tolstoy turned tragic. Stripped of all property, the seriously ill Mikhail Tolstoy traveled to Geneva with his mother Helen G. were his life ended (August 30, 1927). His death cut short a branch of the famous Tolstoy family.

Band history The City of Blacktown Pipe Band was formed in 1975 under the direction of Pipe Major Don McLeish originally as the St John Ambulance Brigade Pipes & Drums and rose quickly to prominence in the competition arena and in 1978, placed 3rd in the Grade 2 Australian Pipe Band Championships. Two years later at the next Australian Championships the band came 2nd, with a first in piping and drumming. In 1981, the band aligned itself with the Blacktwon RSL and changed its name from St Johns Ambulance Brigade Pipe Band to Blacktown RSL Pipe Band. The following year the band once again contested the Grade 2 Australian Championships and successfully gained 1st Place. At the conclusion of that season the band was re-graded to Grade 1 and has since contested over 160 Grade 1 competitions in Australia, New Zealand and Scotland. 1982 saw the formation of a No 2 band to accommodate the growing numbers of junior and other members. The City of Blacktown Pipe Band #2 has also competed successfully in Grade 3A at the 2006 World Pipe Band Championships on Glasgow Green, numerous local contest wins and places and a great win at the 2005 Square Day Competition in Palmerston North. In 1984 the band elected a new Pipe Major in Barry Gray who held this position until 2006, some 22 years. In 1992, on the band's first trip to compete in Scotland the Grade 4 band achieved 2nd place at the World Championships. Whilst the Band relies primarily upon its own activities to provide operational funding, in 1985 there was a change of name to the City of Blacktown Pipe Band following agreement by The City of Blacktown Council to support the band in its training and development activities, the provision of a permanent home at Blacktown Showground close to Blacktown Station, and with periodic assistance towards the cost of replacement of musical instruments. This proved to be a very successful and durable partnership and the ongoing support of the Blacktown community continues to support and encourage the Band's successful growth. Since becoming the City of Blacktown Pipe Band, the band has won the NSW State Pipe Band Championships, East Coast of Australia Championships and the No.2 Band has gained 2nd place in the Australian Grade 4 Championships twice. In 1990, the No.2 band won the drumming event at the Australian Championships. Ainsley Hart become the Pipe Major of the band in 2007 and held this position through to 2011, at which point the Grade 1 band ceased to exist and Andrew Caveney took over the band as Pipe Major. The band now competes in Grade 4. International Contests Indonesia in 1983, 1989 and 2007. New Zealand 1988, Christchurch 1992, Palmerston North 2004, 2005 and 2006. The band has toured Europe including Scotland where both the No.1 & No.2 bands competed in Grade 1 & Grade 4 at the World Pipe Band Championships in 1992, 1995 and 1998. The Band returned to Scotland in 2006, this time with a touring contingent of over 70 players fielding three competition Bands in Grades 1, 3A and 4. Scotland competitions in 2006 included the European Championships in Gourock, Callander, North Berwick, Bridge of Allan, The World Pipe Band Championships, and Perth.

It is useful in graphics, cheminformatics to compare molecular structures, and also bioinformatics for comparing protein structures (in particular, see root-mean-square deviation (bioinformatics)). The algorithm only computes the rotation matrix, but it also requires the computation of a translation vector. When both the translation and rotation are actually performed, the algorithm is sometimes called partial Procrustes superimposition (see also orthogonal Procrustes problem).  Description  The algorithm for the rotation of into starts with two sets of paired points, and . Each set of points can be represented as an matrix. The first row is the coordinates of the first point, the second row is the coordinates of the second point, the th row is the coordinates of the th point. :\\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_N & y_N & z_N \\\\end{pmatrix} The algorithm works in three steps: a translation, the computation of a covariance matrix, and the computation of the optimal rotation matrix. = Translation = Both sets of coordinates must be translated first, so that their centroid coincides with the origin of the coordinate system. This is done by subtracting from the point coordinates the coordinates of the respective centroid. = Computation of the covariance matrix = The second step consists of calculating a matrix . In matrix notation, : H = P^\\\\mathsf{T}Q \\\\, or, using summation notation, : H_{ij} = \\\\sum_{k = 1}^N P_{ki} Q_{kj}, which is a cross-covariance matrix when and are seen as data matrices. = Computation of the optimal rotation matrix = It is possible to calculate the optimal rotation based on the matrix formula : R = \\\\left(H^\\\\mathsf{T} H\\\\right)^\\\\frac12 H^{-1} but implementing a numerical solution to this formula becomes complicated when all special cases are accounted for (for example, the case of not having an inverse). If singular value decomposition (SVD) routines are available, the optimal rotation, , can be calculated using the following simple algorithm. First, calculate the SVD of the covariance matrix . : H = U \\\\Sigma V^\\\\mathsf{T} Next, decide whether we need to correct our rotation matrix to ensure a right-handed coordinate system : d = \\\\mathrm{sign}\\\\left(\\\\det\\\\left(V U^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\right)\\\\right) Finally, calculate our optimal rotation matrix, , as : R = V \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & d \\\\end{pmatrix} U^\\\\mathsf{T} The optimal rotation matrix can also be expressed in terms of quaternions. This alternative description was recently used in the development of a rigorous method for removing rigid-body motions from molecular dynamics trajectories of flexible molecules. In 2002 a generalization for the application to probability distributions (continuous or not) was also proposed. = Generalizations = The algorithm was described for points in a three-dimensional space.

It is approximately north-west of Wiskitki, north-west of ≈ªyrard√≥w, and west of Warsaw. It is the birthplace of statesman and composer, Michal Kleofas Oginski (1765-1833).Jim Samson, The Cambridge Companion to Chopin, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 148.Kielian-Gilbert, Marianne, \\"Chopiniana and Music‚Äôs Contextual Allusions\\", in The Age of Chopin: Interdisciplinary Inquiries, edited by Halina Goldberg, Indiana University Press, 2004, p. 182.Justin Wintle, Makers of Nineteenth-Century Culture: 1800-1914, Routledge, 2002, p. 116. History Paula Szembek Ogi≈Ñska, for forty years staro≈õcina of Guz√≥w Andrzej Ogi≈Ñski, builder of Guz√≥w Manor c.1765 In the late Middle Ages the lands of Guz√≥w were a ducal estate owned by Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia. In the 17th century the settlement was promoted in importance to a rural bailiwick in the possession of Lukasz Opalinski (1612-1666), Grand Marshal of the Crown. After Opalinski the estate changed hands frequently until the early 18th century when the vast 6,000 hectare property came into the Potocki family. Jan Prosper Potocki, starosta of Guz√≥w was briefly the second husband of , for he died early. She became 'staro≈õcina' and brought the immense estate with her in her dowry when she married thirdly the highly influential politician and courtier, . He is credited with introducing stability to the place by erecting an extensive late baroque manorial complex, of which only one 1855 print survives. It comprised an Orangery, an Italian garden and a theatre. Here were born his daughter, J√≥zefa and son, Micha≈Ç Kleofas Ogi≈Ñski, insurrectionist, statesman and composer.Boles≈Çaw Klimaszewski, An outline of Polish Culture, Warsaw, Interpress, 1984, p. 159. His life was too much caught up in the political turmoil of the country to be focused on the estate. He emigrated. =Sugar and cloth give birth to a 'New Town'= After the third partition of Poland in 1795, the estate became the possession of its Prussian conquerors. Strictly, it came under the Prussian kingdom's Treasury, but it was in the gift of Frederick William II of Prussia who passed it to his loyal minister, Karl Georg von Hoym. Being based in Silesia, it was an 'inconvenient' gift and he was minded to sell it back to its erstwhile owner, Ogi≈Ñski's widow, Paula. At this point, her first-born son and jurist Feliks ≈Åubie≈Ñski, stepped in with a cunning plan. Having already successfully entertained the Prussian king at his Szczytniki estate, he obtained royal backing to swap that estate, together with his other properties at Kalinowa, Sieradz County, for Guz√≥w. This arrangement proved acceptable to the Prussian minister and ≈Åubie≈Ñski thus wrested control of his mother's former estate without any money having to be exchanged. Meanwhile, in 1797, a new Prussian king ascended the throne and during a tour of his territories, ≈Åubie≈Ñski and his writer wife, Tekla Teresa, entertained Frederick William III of Prussia and his wife to breakfast. The visit was deemed such a success that it led to the king bestowing upon him the Prussian title of count.≈ªuchlewska Teresa, Feliks ≈Åubie≈Ñski.

There is a summary in English on p. 439. The estate became a favourite retreat from Warsaw for the Lubie≈Ñskis and their family of ten children, which they used for theatrical productions and country pursuits. Henryk ≈Åubie≈Ñski, industrialist, banker and head of the ≈Åubie≈Ñski Brothers Co. In 1827 the widowed Lubie≈Ñski (his wife had died in 1810), now retired from public office, put his energies into the estate. Among other developments, he established 15 new villages. However, his arguably most productive, if doomed, move was to pass the estate onto one of his seven sons, Henryk, an entrepreneur and industrialist, who had greatly contributed to the economic development of Congress Poland.Marian Brandys, Koniec ≈õwiata szwole≈ºer√≥w, Tom 1, Czcigodni weterani, MG, Warszawa 2010, p. 158. Brandys, a writer of popular history, pays tribute to the energy and industry of the ≈Åubie≈Ñski clan. Lubie≈Ñski senior donated Ruda Guzowska, part of the estate, specifically for the creation in 1833 of a state-of-the-art textile factory, with machinery imported from France along with its inventor, Philippe de Girard. It quickly overtook Guz√≥w in importance as a gmina and eventually became the thriving mill town of ≈ªyrard√≥w. In 1829 Henryk had also established in the vicinity of the manor one of the first sugar factories in the country, with the help of imported machinery from France.Zygmunt Przyrembel Historja Cukrownictwa w Polsce, Warszawa 1927, http://cybra.p.lodz.pl/Content/7140/HistoriaCukrownictwaPolsce_OCR1.pdf p.118-129... (in Polish): A comprehensive history of sugar production in Poland. Guz√≥w features throughout the text. However, in 1842 Henryk, by then also a bank director, was accused and convicted of 'misapplying' public funds for his private benefit. He was sent into exile and the estate was confiscated to recover his debts. There is a view that the charges were politically motivated and not based in fact. He returned from detention a broken man and took no further part in public life. =Still in the family= 1880 architectural proposal for Soba≈Ñski Palace In 1856 the whole Guz√≥w estate was put up for auction. In the event, it was acquired for the enormous sum of 600,000 silver roubles by Feliks Soba≈Ñski, the son of a magnate from Podolia. Soba≈Ñski also happened to be a grandson of Feliks ≈Åubie≈Ñski through his mother, R√≥≈ºa, and from 1857, married to another ≈Åubie≈Ñska, Emilia. He set about rebuilding the manor house, fashioning it into a French Renaissance style palace with a park in the manner of Capability Brown. The gradually reduced Guz√≥w estate remained in the possession of the Soba≈Ñski family into two World wars, when the palace served as a military hospital. At the start of World War II it was still the property of Antoni Soba≈Ñski, a wartime writer and journalist with the BBC Polish Section. However, in 1944, it became subject to a land reform and taken over by the Nazi occupiers of Poland. After the Second world war the estate, as all other country estates, was nationalised. Antoni Soba≈Ñski never returned to his homeland and died in London. The palace and the landscape garden complex Feliks Hilary Soba≈Ñski in the early 1900s Andrzej Ogi≈Ñski's 18th-century substantial brick manor house gave way in the next century to a 19th-century confection. The then owner, Feliks Soba≈Ñski, commissioned Polish architect W≈Çadys≈Çaw Hirschel to recreate a property reminiscent of French Loire Valley castles. The landscape architects Walerian Kronenberg and Franciszek Szanio became the designers of a park and gardens in the 'English style'. After its use as a military hospital for the nearby front-line, the palace and the grounds were severely damaged. In the interwar period there was some renovation but during the Second World War the palace interior and furnishings were again plundered. After the war the palace was used as quarters for the employees of the local sugar factory. In 1996 the Soba≈Ñski family succeeded in having the palace complex restituted to it, albeit as a virtual ruin. After many years of neglect the property was in need of complete restoration, as were the grounds. The first building to be refurbished was the old palace chapel, dedicated to St. Felix of Valois and used as a parish church. With help from public heritage funds and hiring out the venue as a film set, work on the restoration is finally under way guided by a firm of specialist architects. Trivia In its pre-1880 French-style reconstruction, the ≈Åubie≈Ñski 18th-century manor at Guz√≥w is said to have been the inspiration for Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko's famous opera, The Haunted Manor - Straszny Dw√≥r - 1865. Vying for the opera's original setting, is another former ≈Åubie≈Ñski manor, given up by the family in 1797, at Kalinowa, but circumstantially it seems less likely. Subsequently, Feliks Hilary Soba≈Ñski was a member of the 'Moniuszko' music society in Warsaw.http://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/index.php/a/feliks-hilary-michal-ludwik- sobanski/ This is the Polish National Dictionary of Biography on-line, accessed 22 January 2017 See also * Soba≈Ñski Palace * Zyrardow References Gallery =Figures associated with Guz√≥w= File:Lukasz Opalinski (1612-1662).jpg≈Åukasz Opali≈Ñski - print File:Feliks Lubienski by J.

She founded a congregation of Religious Sisters of the Franciscan Third Order Regular, known today as the Franciscan Sisters of Blessed Angelina. She is generally credited with the founding of the Third Order Regular for women, as her religious congregation marked the establishment of the first Franciscan community of women living under the Rule of the Third Order Regular authorized by Pope Nicholas V.. Unlike the Second Order of the Franciscan movement, the Poor Clare nuns, they were not an enclosed religious order, but have been active in serving the poor around them for much of their history. She is commemorated by the Franciscans on June 4; her liturgical feast is July 13. Biography =Early life= In 1357, Angelina was born in her ancestral Castle of Montegiove, some 40 kilometers from Orvieto, in Umbria, then part of the Papal States. She was the daughter of Jacopo Angioballi, the Count of Marsciano, and of Anna, the daughter of the Count of Corbara, which is why sometimes she is also referred to as Angelina of Corbara. Left orphaned and alone, except for one sister, by the age of six, she was raised by her grandparents.Grieco, Sr. Claudia Maria. \\"Blessed Angelina from Montegiove\\", Santi e Beati, August 11, 2014 Angelina was married at age 15 to Giovanni da Terni, the Count of Civitella del Tronto, in the Abruzzo region, within the Kingdom of Naples, but he died only two years later, leaving her a childless widow. His death left Angelina in charge of his castle and estate. It was then that Angelina made the decision to dedicate her life to God (it would appear that she had considered being a nun before she was married). She was clothed as a Franciscan tertiary and, with several companions, began an apostolic mission around the countryside of the kingdom, preaching the values of repentance and virginity, as well as service to those in need. Angelina's progress was arrested by the disturbance she caused in the communities where she called for young women to adopt religious life. She was doubly charged with sorcery, the imagined origin of her sway over women, and heresy, because of her allegedly Manichean opposition to marriage. Angelina defended herself before Ladislas, the King of Naples, who dismissed the charges, but expelled her and her companions from the kingdom, in order to avoid further complaints. Angelina then went to Assisi, where she stopped to rest and to pray at the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli, the cradle of the Franciscan Order. There she experienced a vision, wherein God instructed her to found a cloistered monastery under the Rule of the Third Order of Saint Francis in Foligno. The local bishop approved the plans with little hesitation, as they meant an end to her troublesome active ministry. =Foundress= Angelina settled in Foligno about 1394. She soon joined the Monastery of St. Anna, a small community of women Franciscan tertiaries, which had been founded in 1388 by the Blessed Paoluccio Trinci, (died 1390) a Franciscan friar who had been related to her sister through marriage. Known as the \\"Monastery of the Countesses\\"‚Äîdue to the social standing of most of its members, he had established it out of his vision of having these noble women of the city serve as an evangelizing force in their society. The women lived ascetic lives in the monastery, and, not being nuns, followed a very informal structure, free to come and go as they wished, that they might be able to serve the poor and sick of the region. Angelina took a leadership role in the small group and began to organize their lives into a more regular form. By 1397 she was considered the leader of the twelve founding members. In 1403 she was able to obtain a papal bull from Pope Boniface IX which formally recognized the status of the house as a monastery. The reputation of the community in Foligno was so successful that quickly communities of Franciscan tertiary women (called bizocche locally) throughout the region sought to affiliate with them. Communities under her authority were soon established in Florence, Spoleto, Assisi, and Viterbo, along with eleven others, before Angelina's death in 1435. The diverse communities were recognized as a congregation by Pope Martin V in 1428. This decree also allowed them to elect a Minister General (a title since reserved for the head of the friars) who would have the right of canonical visitation of the other communities. The congregation held its first general elections in 1430, in which Angela was elected their first Minister General. In this office, she developed the Statutes for the congregation, to be followed by all its houses. This degree of independence was not welcomed by the Friars Minor, who had been granted complete authority over the tertiaries that same year. The Minister General of the friars, Guglielmo da Casala, demanded that the Third Order Sisters of the congregation be confirmed under obedience to him. Angelina had to submit and, in a public ceremony held in the friars' church in Foligno on 5 November 1430, vowed obedience to the local Minister Provincial. This act of obedience, however, was repudiated by the chapter of the community at Santa Anna, saying that it was invalid due to having been forced under duress and without their approval. The Holy See confirmed their autonomy the following year. To avoid the potential for future repetition of this conflict, the congregation put themselves under the obedience of their local bishops, with their spiritual direction to come from the friars of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance. Legacy and veneration Angeline died on July 14, 1435Foley, Leonard ofm, \\"Blessed Angeline of Marsciano\\", Saint of the Day, Franciscan Media Blessed Angelina was interred in the Church of St. Francis in Foligno upon her death. Her remains were removed to a grander shrine in 1492. Her cultus was approved in 1825. Due to the requirement of keeping their communities small and simple, Angelina's congregation gained greatest popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1428, they had been put briefly by Pope Martin V under the jurisdiction of the Friars Minor, with a specific mandate for the education and instruction of young girls. Even so, their work was fairly apostolic until they were required to become an enclosed religious order in 1617, having taken solemn vows with a strict separation from the affairs of the external world, limited to the education of girls within the cloister. With a 1903 lift of papal enclosure, a wider apostolate was again permitted, and the congregation became known as the Franciscan Sisters of Blessed Angelina. As of 1750, they consisted of 11 houses and 80 members. As of the year A.D. 2000, they have houses in Brazil, Madagascar and Switzerland, as well as in Italy.

Redesignated ARNORTH in 2004, it was first activated in early January 1943 as the United States Fifth Army, under the command of Lieutenant General Mark Wayne Clark. History =World War II= The United States Fifth Army was one of the principal formations of the U.S. Army in the Mediterranean during World War II, and was the first American field army ever to be activated outside of the United States.Mikolashek, p. 44 It was officially activated on 5 January 1943 at Oujda, French Morocco and made responsible for the defence of Algeria and Morocco. It was also given the responsibility for planning the American part of the invasion of mainland Italy, and therefore was not involved in the Allied invasion of Sicily (codenamed Operation Husky), where it was instead assigned the role of training combat troops destined for Sicily.Mikolashek, p. 51 The United States Fifth Army was initially commanded by Lieutenant General Mark Wayne Clark, who would lead the Fifth Army for nearly two years,Mikolashek, p. 47 and was to experience some of the toughest fighting of World War II, where it was engaged on the Italian Front, which was, in many ways, often more reminiscent of the trench warfare of the Western Front in World War I. Writing to Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers (American deputy to Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, Mediterranean Theater commander)Mikolashek, p. 110 in late March 1944, Clark explained the difficulties of the fighting in Italy so far, which could be said of the whole campaign. They were, he claimed, \\"Terrain, weather, carefully prepared defensive positions in the mountains, determined and well- trained enemy troops, grossly inadequate means at our disposal while on the offensive, with approximately equal forces to the defender.\\"Mikolashek, p. 117 The Fifth Army first saw action during the Salerno landings (Operation Avalanche), the assault landings at Salerno, part of the Allied invasion of Italy, in September 1943. Due to the comparatively low numbers of American troops available in the Mediterranean Theater it was made up of one American and one British corps. They were the U.S. VI Corps, under Major General Ernest J. DawleyMikolashek, p. 57 and the British X Corps, under Lieutenant-General Richard L. McCreery. At Salerno, VI Corps landed on the right flank, and X Corps on the left flank. Progress was initially slow, due in part to a lack of initiative by Dawley, the VI Corps commander, and due also to heavier than expected German resistance. However, heavy naval and air bombardment, along with a parachute drop by elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, had saved the forces from any danger of being driven back into the sea, combined with the approach of the British Eighth Army, under General Bernard Montgomery (the Eighth Army had landed further south in Operation Baytown, six days before Avalanche), the German 10th Army began to retreat. On 20 September, by which time the Fifth and Eighth Armies had linked up,Mikolashek, p. 63 Major General Dawley, VI Corps commander, was relieved of his command by Clark. Dawley was temporarily made deputy army commander, and was soon replaced in command of VI Corps by Major General John P. Lucas.Mikolashek, p. 64 Mark W. Clark, pictured here in 1942 as a major general, was destined to command the Fifth Army throughout most of its existence. Progress was then good for a couple of weeks and the Fifth Army crossed the Barbara Line and the Volturno Line until the Germans turned, stood and fought. They had established a position on the Winter Line (also known as the Gustav Line), which included the formidable defensive positions at San Pietro Infine in the Liri Valley and at Monte Cassino. By this point, Fifth Army had been reinforced by a second American corps, II Corps, commanded by Major General Geoffrey Keyes.Mikolashek, p. 72 By the end of November Clark's Fifth Army had almost doubled in size, with the addition of French General Alphonse Juin's French Expeditionary Corps, from 130,247 men to 243,827.Mikolashek, p. 73 With the failure of the first operations to capture Monte Cassino, an attempt was made to exploit the Allied preponderance in seapower before the coming invasion of Normandy robbed the Mediterranean of the naval forces necessary for an amphibious assault to seize Rome.Mikolashek, p. 79 VI Corps, with its experience of amphibious landings at Salerno, was chosen for the assault and withdrawn from the line, replaced by the French Expeditionary Corps. They made a second attempt to capture Monte Cassino in conjunction with the amphibious assault by VI Corps, which again failed. VI Corps landed at Anzio, unopposed,Mikolashek, p. 97 on 22 January 1944 in Operation Shingle, and suffered many of the same problems as had been seen at Salerno. A perceived lack of initiative on the part of the commander, Major General Lucas, combined with worries about the Germans catching VI Corps off balance if it advanced too far inland resulted in the beachhead being bottled up. The Germans launched a series of attacks and counterattacks, with both sides sustaining heavy losses, and nearly breached the last beachhead defences before again being driven off by heavy naval and air support. The fault, however, \\"was not due to Lucas's incompetence; it was due instead to wishful thinking, faulty operational planning, and the German army's ability to respond forcefully and aggressively.\\"Mikolashek, p. 80 After the failure of Shingle, a large reorganisation took place. Previously the Apennines had been the rough dividing line between Fifth and Eighth Armies. However, the dividing line was shifted westwards, to allow the concentration of both armies on the western side of Italy for maximum firepower to break through to Rome. British V Corps was left on the Adriatic coast to pin down any German units there. Fifth Army was relieved of responsibility for CassinoMikolashek, p. 119 and the final phases of that battle saw Indian, New Zealand and finally Polish troops thrown against the fortress. Fifth Army also lost McCreery's British X Corps at this time, since it was felt that having exclusively American-organised units under Fifth Army and British-organised units under Eighth Army would ease logistics. The breakthrough was achieved during the spring of 1944. Coordinated assaults by all the Allied forces, except V Corps, which was confined to a holding action, broke through. II Corps attacked along the coast, the French Expeditionary Corps, in a classic demonstration of mountain warfare, broke through on the right flank of Fifth Army, and VI Corps, now commanded by Major General Lucian K. Truscott, broke out of the Anzio beachhead. By early summer, Allied forces were well on their way to capturing Rome. At this point, one of the more controversial incidents in the history of Fifth Army occurred. The strategic conception of General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the Allied Armies in Italy (later redesigned 15th Army Group),Mikolashek, p. 149 was that the forces of VI Corps, coming out of Anzio, would trap the retreating German forces, and leave them to be annihilated by the advancing Fifth and Eighth Armies.Mikolashek, p. 125 However, in contravention of orders, Clark diverted units of VI Corps towards Rome, leaving a small blocking force to attempt to stop the Germans. It failed to do so, and the German forces were able to escape and reestablish a coherent line to the north of Rome. Clark claimed that there were significant German threats which necessitated the diversion, but many believe that he was primarily glory-seeking by being the first to liberate Rome. Two days after Rome fell, on 4 June 1944, Operation Overlord was launched.Mikolashek, p. 137 The strategic conception of Overlord called for a supporting operation to be mounted by invading southern France. In order to do so, forces would have to be withdrawn from the Allied Armies in Italy. In the end, VI Corps was withdrawn, forming the nucleus of the field forces of the U.S. Seventh Army for the invasion of the French Riviera, Operation Dragoon. The French Expeditionary Corps was also withdrawn, to allow its men to be used to for the French First Army, a follow-up formation for Dragoon. In slightly less than two months, the strength of the Fifth Army dropped from 248,989 down to 153,323.Mikolashek, p. 142 However, the 25,000-strong Brazilian Expeditionary Force, under Marshal J.B. Mascarenhas de Morais,Mikolashek, p. 143 as well as other divisions had arrived to align with U.S. IV Corps (which had arrived in June) under Major General Willis D. Crittenberger, so two corps were maintained within Fifth Army. In the second half of 1944, the Allied forces fighting on the Italian Front within the U.S. Fifth Army and British Eighth Army resembled more a multi-national force being constituted by: Americans (including segregated African/and/Japanese- Americans), British, French, members of French and British colonies (New Zealanders, Canadians, Indians, Gurkhas, Black Africans, Moroccans, Algerians, Jews and Arabs from the British Mandate in Palestine, South Africans, Rhodesians), as well as Brazilians and exiled forces from Poland, Greece, former Czechoslovakia and anti-fascist Italians.Ready, J.Lee, \\"Forgotten Allies: The Military Contribution of the Colonies, Exiled Governments and Lesser Powers to the Allied Victory in World War II\\"Corrigan, Gordon \\"The Second World War\\" Thomas Dunne Books, 2011 Page 523 The Germans reestablished their line across Italy at the level of Pisa and Rimini. The Allied forces spent another winter, after fierce fighting in the summer and autumn in front of the Gothic Line, frustrated at their lack of ability to break through. This time Fifth Army, with British XIII Corps under command, led by Lieutenant- General Sidney Kirkman (whose relationship with Clark was apparently very stormy) was straddling the Apennines, with many of its units occupying high, exposed positions which were miserable to garrison. That winter also saw a significant change of command. Lieutenant General Clark moved to command 15th Army Group (previously styled the Allied Armies in Italy), and Lieutenant General Lucian K. Truscott was appointed to command Fifth Army in his place. Truscott would command the Army from 16 December 1944 until the war's end. Another change came in January 1945 when XIII Corps reverted to control of British Eighth Army, which had also seen many changes in composition and command, and was now commanded by Lieutenant-General Richard L. McCreery. In the final offensive of the Italian campaign, launched in April 1945, against the German Army Group C, the Eighth Army initiated the main offensive on the Adriatic coast, and then the Fifth Army also broke through the German defenses around Bologna. The German units, in the main, were pinned against the Po River and destroyed, or at the very least deprived of their transport and heavy weapons, which effectively made many of them useless. II Corps units raced through Milan towards the French frontier and the great port of Genoa. IV Corps pushed due north through Verona, Vicenza and as far as Bolzano and to the Brenner Pass, where they linked up with elements of the U.S. Seventh Army, under Lieutenant General Alexander Patch. Its role in Italy cost Fifth Army dearly. It suffered 109,642 casualties in 602 days of combat, of which 19,475 were killed in action. The Fifth Army headquarters returned to the United States in September 1945. Fifth Army was deactivated on 2 October 1945 at Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts.Mikolashek, p. 161 In the informal athletic competitions held between units of the European and North African theaters, the Fifth Army was among the most successful, winning titles in baseball, boxing, swimming and football during the 1944 season. The football championship was gained after a victory over 12th Air Force in the Spaghetti Bowl on 1 January 1945. =Order of Battle August 1944= (Part of 15th Army Group) * 25px United States Fifth Army ‚Äì (Lieutenant General Mark Clark)  24px U.S. II Corps ‚Äì (Major General Geoffrey Keyes) * 22px U.S. 34th Infantry Division ‚Äì (Major General Charles L.

Lucas, who had commanded U.S. VI Corps in the early stages of the Battle of Anzio (Operation Shingle) during World War II before being relieved. It was redesignated as the Fifth United States Army on 1 January 1957. Its postwar role was as a command and control headquarters for U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard units, formally responsible for the training of many Army troops and also the ground defense of part of the continental United States. In June 1971, the Fifth Army moved to its current base at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. =Redesignation in 2004= In 2004, Fifth Army transferred its Reserve preparation obligations to First Army, and became responsible for homeland defense and Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) as United States Army North, the Army Service Component Command of United States Northern Command.

Dorsey. The post office operated from August 28, 1889, until March 24, 1924. It is reported that Dorsey was a beekeeper, which provided the source of the name for the Post Office and thus the community. The community was served by Apiary School District #38, which operated a two-room school providing education services for grades 1 through 8. When operational, it operated in conjunction with the Rainier Union High School District which provided education services for grades 9 through 12. (The high school district also included a number of other grade school districts in the area: Delena, Hudson, Fern Hill, Rainier, Goble, Shiloh Basin, and Neer City districts. In the 1960s, the districts were consolidated into a single district, and the rural schools were closed over the next 10 to 15 years.) The community and the school are located along the road now known as Apiary Road near the headwaters of the North Fork of the Clatskanie River. At this writing, the school building still exists but has been converted to a private home. The community also includes a pioneer cemetery but has never contained a community center such as a church, Grange hall, or even a fire station. Currently, Apiary Roadhttp://egov.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TDATA/gis/docs/countymaps/colu1.pdf Columbia County Road Map is a popular freight route for forest products moving from the Northern Oregon Coast Range (particularly areas drained by the Nehalem River) to markets in Longview, Washington. The Apiary Road interconnects the Nehalem Highway north of Pittsburg signed as Oregon Route 47 with U.S. Route 30 west of Rainier. However, the intersection with U.S. Route 30 is signed as Larson Road, because Apiary Road technically ends at Old Rainier Road, a former route of U.S. Route 30 just to the south of the present U.S. Route 30.

History  The band can trace its origins back to 1882, after the Lord Provost's Committee suggested in February of the same year that a police band be formed. The band was not a pipe band at this time, but did however contain pipers. The earliest known performance by the band was held on 2 June 1883 when the \\"Edinburgh City Police Pipers\\" played a number of sets at Waverly Market. The police band was deemed too expensive for the force to run due to the large number of musicians and became a town band instead. Around 1900, the Edinburgh City Police Pipe Band was formed, led by Pipe Major Norman Graham. When Graham died in 1910, Pipe Sergeant Hugh Calder took over the leadership of the band. It was under Calder that the band was to win its first major competition. In 1919 the band won the Argyle shield at the Cowal Games, equivalent to the World Pipe Band Championships as they are known today. After the retiral of Pipe-Major John Burgess, Iain McLeod, already a successful solo piper, took over the mantle of Pipe Major from 1959 until his retiral from the police in 1976. Under his leader-ship, the band was extremely successful competitively and won 5 World Pipe-Band Championship titles in 1963 (Dumfries), 1964 (Ayr), 1971 (Lanark), 1972 (Hawick) and in 1975 (Corby) as the renamed Lothian and Borders Police Pipe-Band. Not only was the band successful competitively during this period, but represented the Police, the city of Edinburgh, Scotland and the U.K. performing at events throughout the UK and Europe, Canada and the USA, Japan, South Africa, Russia and even in Guam. The trip to Russia took place at the height of the Cold War period in 1966, to promote British trade and industry alongside British Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The music was enjoyed by piping enthusiasts all over the world and the band released 5 albums, as well as making cameo appearances in several Hollywood films including the original Casino Royale, Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Battle of the Sexes and Let's be Happy. During the International Edinburgh Festival, they were a regular feature, marching in a daily parade along Princes Street enjoyed by locals and tourists alike; one of the film sequences featured Vera Ellen as the \\"Drum Major\\". On 30 November 2012, the decision to disband the pipe band was taken, due to a lack of members. It was dissolved on 31 March 2013, to coincide with the formation of a new single police force in Scotland. Pipe Majors as Edinburgh City Police Pipers *Constable A.

It is encoded by the NEBL gene. This family is composed of 5 members: nebulette, nebulin, N-RAP, LASP-1 and LASP-2. Nebulette localizes to Z-discs of cardiac muscle and appears to regulate the length of actin thin filaments.  Structure  Nebulette is a 116.4 kDa protein composed of 1014 amino acids. As a member of the nebulin family of proteins, nebulette is characterized by 35 amino acid stretches of ‚Äò‚Äònebulin repeats‚Äô‚Äô, which are actin binding domains containing a conserved SDxxYK motif. Like nebulin, nebulette has an acidic region with unknown structure at its N-terminus, and a serine-rich region adjacent to an SH3 domain at its C-terminus. Though nebulette shares structural features with nebulin, nebulin is expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle and has an enormous size (600-900 kDa), while nebulette is expressed in cardiac muscle at Z-disc regions and is significantly smaller (roughly 1/6 of the size). Nebulette interacts with actin, tropomyosin, alpha-actinin. Xin, and XIRP2.  Function  Nebulette was identified in 1995 by Moncman and Wang using primary cultures of chicken embryonic cardiomyocytes by immunoprecipitations with certain anti-nebulin monoclonal antibodies. Normal expression of nebulette is essential for the assembly and contractile function of myofibrils. Specifically, nebulette appears to regulate the stability and length of actin thin filaments, as well as beating frequencies of cardiomyocytes; reduction of full-length nebulette protein in cardiomyocytes resulted in reduced thin filament lengths, depressed beating frequencies and loss of thin filament regulatory proteins troponin I and tropomyosin.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the NEBL gene have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. Studies in transgenic mice have supported their causative role in endocardial fibroelastosis and dilated cardiomyopathy.

Originally it was a small settlement to the south of the much more important Holdenhurst Village, and for centuries it existed as a huddle of farm buildings on the edge of heathland. As the town of Bournemouth expanded, Littledown remained as a farming community with areas of open fields on the town's northern edge, with the Cooper-Dean family residing in Littledown House. Eventually however the only Cooper-Dean descendants were two spinster sisters who sold Littledown House, with the surrounding farmland, to Bournemouth Council in the early 1980s. After public discussion on what the Council would do with the area, eventually much of the land was sold off for housing, although a large section was set by for a park and a sports centre. Most of the built environment that now makes up Littledown was subsequently developed in the 1980s. Notable buildings include the Chaseside Campus of JPMorgan, the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth County Court and the Littledown Leisure Centre. In Riverside Avenue there is a mid-20th century home for retired nurses. Littledown House, a listed building dating back to the late 18th century, is located in the grounds of the JPMorgan campus, and has been restored to the elegance it would have displayed at the time of its construction, when it would have been a classic Jane Austen-type mansion. With all the new buildings that now cover Littledown, it can be difficult to imagine it as farmland, but drivers on the A338 Spur Road can look out for a set of warning lights near to the back of the hospital site. When the Spur Road was first built, it cut off the Cooper Dean land at Littledown from their farms at Holdenhurst. One of the concessions to the family was that the road was built with a cattle crossing. No one seems to recall it ever being used, however the old agreement remains in force. Littledown is south east of Strouden Park and Townsend.

Built in 1891 to a design by Ambrose Thornley, it is located on 80 Druitt Street, at the corner with York Street, and is adjacent to other prominent heritage landmarks, the Sydney Town Hall and the Queen Victoria Building. Formerly known as Gresham Hotel, the property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Hong Kong House houses the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, the office of the Hong Kong Tourism Board in Australasia, Invest Hong Kong and the office of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. History In 1888 the Excelsior Land, Building and Investment Company and Bank Limited held a competition for the design of a hotel and banking premises on the site. The competition was subsequently won by architect Ambrose Thornley, with his final design submitted in June 1890 and labelled \\"Central Hotel\\". By the late 1900s, the hotel had been renamed the \\"Gresham Hotel\\" and in 1896 a branch of the City Bank of Sydney had been opened on the ground level of the building. In 1925 the hotel was bought by Tooth and Co. When the City Bank of Sydney was bought out, the bank became a branch of the Australian Bank of Commerce in 1918, and later a branch of the Bank of New South Wales when they bought the Bank of Commerce in 1931. In the late 1980s the \\"Gresham Hotel\\" was converted to offices and since 1995 has housed the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office. The building is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate, with its interior listed in the City of Sydney Local Environmental Plan. A plaque commemorating the building's history and continuing association with Hong Kong was unveiled on 23 June 2011 by Governor of NSW, Marie Bashir, and Hong Kong Chief Executive, Donald Tsang. In late 2014, during the \\"Umbrella\\" protests in Hong Kong, the street-level frontages of Hong Kong House were covered with yellow, pink and blue Post-it notes containing messages of solidarity with the protests.  Heritage listing  As at 3 March 2005, Hong Kong House, formerly the Gresham Hotel and Central Hotel, is situated on a prominent site on the corner of York and Druitt Streets forming part of the Town Hall streetscape. It is a five-storey building of Victorian Free Classical Style. The erection of this building as a prestigious hotel in the early 1890s is historically significant in understanding the impact that the building of Centennial Hall and the Queen Victoria Building had on creating a focus for civic pride in Victorian Sydney. It is an important building in the professional career of architect Ambrose Thornley.

California Medical Association, (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1964) was a legal case between two medical associations in the state of California. The case was under review in California state courts from 1962-1964. After numerous appeals, the California Supreme Court ruling found the California Medical Association's refusal to grant osteopathic physicians licensure to practice medicine in the state of California to be unconstitutional. Background By the 1950s, osteopathic physicians (D.O.) were numerous in California compared to their Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) counterparts, since the medical school at University of California, Irvine was an osteopathic medical school. Nevertheless, osteopathic physicians began to feel victimized by the national image of osteopathic medicine, particularly from those MDs who viewed colleges of osteopathic medicine as teaching \\"cultist healing.\\"Gevitz, Norman (2004). The DOs: Osteopathic Medicine in America. The Johns Hopkins University Press. . Leaders of the California Medical Association (CMA) and the California Osteopathic Association (COA) met secretly behind closed doors in the late 1950s to discuss a potential merger between the two medical groups. By May 1961, a contract between CMA and COA was ready to be voted on by their respective House of Delegates. As part of the merger, which was approved in 1962, all graduates from the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (COP&S;) as well as DOs who held a valid license in the state would be awarded a Doctor of Medicine degree. Further, those DOs who accepted the MD degree could no longer identify themselves as osteopathic physicians. As part of the merger agreement, COP&S; was renamed as the California College of Medicine and accredited as a MD degree granting institution. Additionally, an initiative, proposition 22, was placed on the state ballot during the November 1962 elections that would limit the osteopathic state licensing board from administering new licensing. It could still renew licenses of DOs until the number of practicing DOs diminished to less than 40, at which time it would be dissolved and the remaining DOs transferred to the jurisdiction of the state medical licensing board. Meanwhile, the California College of Medicine was adopted by the University of California Regents in 1964 and placed on their Irvine campus in 1968. Ex-DO faculty that received the MD degree in 1962 taught alongside congenital MD faculty for several decades henceforth. In 2007 the college's name was again changed to the University of California Irvine, School of Medicine. The California Medical Association (CMA) issued MD degrees to all DOs in the state of California for a nominal fee. \\"By attending a short seminar and paying $65, a doctor of osteopathy (now Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) (DO) could obtain an MD degree; 86 percent of the DOs in the state (out of a total of about 2000) chose to do so.\\" It also placed a ban on issuing physician licenses to DOs moving to California from other states. However, the decision proved to be controversial. In 1974, after protest and lobbying by influential and prominent DOs, the California Supreme Court ruled in Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California v. California Medical Association, that licensing of DOs in that state must be resumed. Today, the Medical Board of California, which licenses M.D.s and International Medical School Graduates (M.B.B.S. / M.D.), and the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, which licenses D.O.s whose degree was obtained from an American Osteopathic Association (AOA) approved Medical School, operate as separate Medical Licensing Institutions.

In 1975 the team switched to a Toyota powerplant in the MC75, only to suffer from another early retirement. Sigma Automotive would continue to compete in numerous domestic series. In 1985, the racing division of Sigma Automotive became an independent company, Kato established a company called Sigma Advanced Racing Development (SARD) specialising in motorsport as well as producing aftermarket parts for Toyota automobiles.JCN Network: Toyota to Enter Hybrid Sedan in 24-hour Race SARD returned to international motorsports in 1989, debuting as a Toyota backed team named Toyota Team SARD in the first round of World Sports Prototype Championship held in Suzuka, using a Toyota 89C-V, also competing in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship. With the demise of Group C in 1993, SARD switched to the newly formed JGTC series and also return to Le Mans with a V8 powered MR2 known as the MC8-R, having the same spell of misfortune as they had during the 1970s, competing in 1995 and 1996, only to fail to pre-qualify in the face of the newer generations of GT1 cars in the following year. SARD also entered a Toyota Supra in first two years of the MC8-R program where it faced against fellow Japanese GT machines in form of Nissan Skyline GT-R and Honda NSX, the latter which also raced in and won the GT2 class in 1995. SARD continued to compete in the JGTC and Super GT series with works-backed Toyotas and Lexuses; the team currently fields a Toyota GR Supra under the Toyota Team SARD name. In 2016, SARD won its first- ever Super GT championship with a Lexus RC F driven by Heikki Kovalainen and Kohei Hirate.

The facility features a ¬º mile NHRA- sanctioned dragstrip, a 9-turn road course, and a motocross track. It is owned and operated by the B.C. Custom Car Association, and the BCCCA operates the drag strip directly. The road course and motocross tracks are operated independently by the Sports Car Club of British Columbia (SCCBC) and the Lower Mainland Motocross Club (LMMC) respectively. Drag strip history The BCCCA originally drag raced on unused runways at Abbotsford Airport from 1952 to 1957. The original Mission Raceway Park opened in 1965, and the facility operated until 1978 (a motocross track was added in 1973). However, MRP was shut down when the District of Mission wanted to establish an industrial park on the site. After years of negotiating and legal wrangling, the new MRP was opened on March 14, 1992, on land near the Fraser River. The drag strip was awarded a National Open by the NHRA in 1993. Dragster motorcycle at Mission Raceway in 2010 MRP won the NHRA Division 6 Track Of The Year Award five years in a row, from 1994 to 1998. It then won the same award three years in a row from 2005 to 2007.Mission Raceway Park History Road course history The SCCBC originally road raced on unused runways at Abbotsford Airport. In 1958, the SCCBC opened the Westwood Racing Circuit, which operated until the club lost their lease in 1990. The SCCBC worked out an arrangement with the BCCCA, and in 1992 opened the River‚Äôs Edge Road Course at Mission Raceway Park. The road course was used for driver training classes during the first two years, and began full road racing operations in 1994. The road course was changed for 2008 with lefthand turn 7 becoming a left-right combination (7A-7B) leading into a new lefthand turn 8 (previously a right) and a longer, wider turn 9. This caused higher exit speed onto the straight, and may have contributed to the trackday death of Suzuki TLR-1000 rider Cam Gillispie, 33, on 12 June 2009 when he struck the outside concrete wall after exiting turn 9. The track was reconfigured for motorcycles in 2010, returning to a lefthand turn 7 followed by a righthand turn 8 leading into the original turn 9 feeding onto the straight. Cars continue to use the new configuration.

Life and career SpƒÉtaru was born on 2 October 1939, in a family of teachers, Gherghina and Aurel SpƒÉtaru. He spent his childhood in Aliman, his hometown, in Ion Corvin and in Medgidia, with his elder sister Puica (Maria Nicola) and his grandparents, farmers. Horses were the first passion as a child, later another passion emerged, much stronger, that of football. SpƒÉtaru grew up among his grandparents' stories and songs played by his parents. When he was 12, his mother died, and the two children moved to Medgidia with an aunt to fulfill the mother's wish that her children go to school. This is where SpƒÉtaru graduated from high school and started his football career. He evolved as a midfielder at the club FC Sportul Studen»õesc Bucure»ôti. In the third year at the \\"Faculty of Physical Education and Sport\\" he had to give up football, due to a disc herniation. He then dedicated himself to school and music. SpƒÉtaru was a student when he started playing at \\"Student House\\" in 1962. He started with Italian music, which was fashionable at the time. He inherited the love for music from his family; his father had played the violin. It was Camelia DƒÉscƒÉlescu who saw him. He listened to her once at \\"Mon Jardin\\" and took lessons with her. The first musical pieces performed by SpƒÉtaru were by DƒÉscƒÉlescu. Once on a terrace he met Temistocle Popa, who made almost all the rattles. The first great success was with \\"SƒÉ »ôtii mƒÉicu»õa mea\\" by Popa. In 1972, he met his future wife, Sida, at the \\"Fantasio Theater\\" in Constan»õa. They married in 1974 and had a daughter, Dana. According to his wife's testimony, SpƒÉtaru was a \\"convinced family member\\" and \\"a model of a daddy.\\" He is the record-holder of the longest crowd applause of 16 minutes and 19 seconds. This happened in Varadero, Cuba in 1967, at an international festival.Dan SpƒÉtaru Discogs Autobiography SpƒÉtaru died of a heart attack on the morning of 8 September 2004. He was buried at Bellu cemetery in Bucharest; more than ten thousand people were present at his funeral. Songs He started his singing career in 1966, at the \\"Student's house\\". He wrote his first hit in 1984, \\"Drumurile\\" (The roads). Subsequently he became famous in Romania with other songs, such as: \\"De vrei sƒÉ »ôtii ce √ÆnseamnƒÉ roman\\", \\"Dragu mi‚Äìi de »õara mea\\", \\"Drum bun\\", \\"√én r√¢ndul patru\\", \\"Oare, oare\\", \\"MƒÉicu»õƒÉ, √Æ»õi mul»õumesc\\", \\"Nimic nu e prea mult\\", \\"Nu vreau sƒÉ pl√¢ngi\\", \\"Prietene\\", \\"SƒÉ c√¢ntƒÉm, chitara mea\\", \\"Spune-mi, mama ce mai face\\", \\"Spune-mi unde, spune-mi cine\\", \\"»öƒÉrƒÉncu»õƒÉ, »õƒÉrƒÉncu»õƒÉ\\", \\"Te-am iubit, Mario\\", \\"Te-a»ôteaptƒÉ un om\\", \\"Nu m-am g√¢ndit la despƒÉr»õire\\", \\"Mai trece o zi\\", \\"»òi ce dacƒÉ trece vremea\\", \\"Trecea fanfara militarƒÉ\\", \\"Cine te-a iubit?\\", \\"Cer»ôetorul de luminƒÉ\\".

The school is located at 1601 N Sherman Ave., the same building as Madison's Sherman Middle School. Shabazz is known for its informal atmosphere (students refer to teachers and the principal by their first names) and emphasis on individuality and social and political activism. According to former social studies teacher Gene Delacourt, \\"Shabazz was designed to be an alternative school for the sake of it being an alternative school, rather than it being a last chance for diploma completion or the last chance for kids who were falling through the cracks. When the school was founded, it was originally founded by students who were motivated to learn something other than what mainstream schools were teaching. Teachers responded to that by teaching their passion.\\" Admission Students must apply for admission to Shabazz, with new students being accepted at the beginning of each semester. Academics Shabazz operates on a quarterly schedule. The school offers a varied selection of courses, including The First Amendment (Social Studies), Science of Global Warming, Rap as Poetry (English), and American Sign Language. All new students are required to take an anti-discrimination Social Studies course called Mirrors.

All of the battleships of the Erzherzog Karl-class were built in the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyards in Trieste. The first battleship, was laid down in 1902. Construction on the remaining two battleships, and continued up to 1905. Erzherzog Karl was commissioned in 1906, while Erzherzog Ferdinand Max and Erzherzog Friedrich were commissioned in 1907. The three Erzherzog Karl-class battleships were considered relatively modern by the time they were commissioned. However, small docking space and budget restraints resulted in the class being fairly compact. Nevertheless, they were well designed and properly protected. The Erzherzog Karl class were the last and largest pre-dreadnoughts built by the Austrian Navy. They were named after members of the Austrian Royal family. Despite these qualities, the Erzherzog Karl-class battleships were inferior to the more modern Dreadnought type battleships ‚Äì with their \\"all big gun\\" armament and turbine propulsion. As a result, they only played a limited role during World War I. At the beginning of the war, the members of the Erzherzog Karl class formed the III division of the Austrian-Hungarian battle-fleet. Despite their largely inactive involvement in the conflict, the battleships of the Erzherzog Karl class did participate in the flight of and during the opening days of the war, as well as the bombardment of Ancona on 23 May 1915. The ships also took part in suppressing a major mutiny among the crew members of several armored cruisers stationed in Cattaro between 1‚Äì3 February 1918. Following Austria-Hungary's defeat in World War I, Erzherzog Karl and Erzherzog Friedrich were handed over to France. The remaining battleship, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, was given to Great Britain. Erzherzog Karl ran aground at Bizerte and was broken up there in 1921. The remaining two battleships were scrapped in 1921 in Italy.  Design  = General characteristics = Right elevation and plan of the Erzherzog Karl class The Erzherzog Karl class displaced . They were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They were manned by 700 men. = Propulsion = The ships were propelled by two two-shaft, four cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines. On trials, they developed , which could move the ship along at a speed of . On trials, Erzherzog Karls engines managed to produce a knot more speed than was originally planned. = Armament = The Erzherzog Karl class carried a primary armament made by ≈†koda Works. On each ship, there were four /40 caliber guns in two twin turrets on the centerline. These guns were an Austro-Hungarian replica of the 24 cm/40 (9.4\\") Krupp C/94, which was used on the Habsburgs. The guns could be depressed to ‚àí5¬∞ and elevated to 30¬∞. The arc of fire of the guns was 300¬∞, or 150¬∞ in each direction. Each gun required a crew of twenty men. At maximum elevation, the gun could fire a shell . They could fire three to four armor-piercing shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of . Each of the guns weighed at least . Their secondary armament consisted of twelve /42 caliber guns, also made by ≈†koda, mounted in eight single casemates on either wing of the ship and two single midships turrets on the either wing of the ship. They could be depressed to ‚àí3¬∞ and elevated to 20¬∞. They could fire a armor-piercing shell at maximum elevation with a muzzle velocity of . The gun weighed 12.1 tons and could fire three rounds per minute. The ships had a tertiary armament for protection against torpedo boats in the form of the /45 caliber gun, too manufactured by ≈†koda. They could be depressed to ‚àí10¬∞ and elevated to 20, and had an arc of fire of 360¬∞, meaning that they could fire at any target within their range of fire. The guns could fire about ten to fifteen rounds per minute. At their maximum elevation, the guns could fire a high-explosive charge at a muzzle velocity of . Anti-aircraft and airship protection was covered by the four Vickers anti-aircraft guns on the ship. They could be depressed to ‚àí5¬∞ and elevated to 80¬∞. They had an arc of fire of 360¬∞, which meant that they also could engage any target within their range. Manually operated by only one crewman, they could fire a shell at maximum elevation with a muzzle velocity of . Designed in 1910, each of the guns weighed . After 1916-17 refits two ≈†koda 7 cm L/45 guns on anti-aircraft mounts were installed. The Erzherzog Karl class was also fitted with two above water torpedo tubes, although they were rarely used. = Armor = The armor plating of the battleships around the waterline belt, one of the more vulnerable areas of a ship, was , while their deck armor was . The turrets and casemates had and armor respectively. This was done in order to protect the battleships against a possible shell landing on the turrets and the imminent explosion resulting from such a hit. The conning tower of the ships had of armor plating, while the bulkheads inside the battleship that separated different compartments were thick.  Construction  The Erzherzog Karl class, like the Habsburg class before them and the Radetzky class after them were named after archdukes of the Austro-Hungarian Royal Family, specifically Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, Maximilian I of Mexico and Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen. The ships were all laid down at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste. The first ship of the class, was laid down on 24 July 1902. Following 15 months of construction she was launched on 4 October 1903 and finally commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 17 June 1906. The next ship of the class was . She was laid down on 4 October 1902 and launched on 30 April 1904. Erzherzog Friedrich was finally commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 31 January 1907. The third and final ship of the Erzherzog Karl class was . She was laid down on 9 March 1904 and later launched on 21 May 1905. She was commissioned into the navy on 21 December 1907.

The members of the Erzherzog Karl class were mobilized on the eve of the war to support the flight of and . The two German ships were attempting to break out of Messina, being chased by the French Navy and the Royal Navy, and make their way to Turkey. The breakout succeeded. When the flotilla had advanced as far south as Brindisi in south eastern Italy, the Austro-Hungarian ships were recalled. In company with other units of the Austro Hungarian Navy the class took part in the bombardment of Ancona on May 24, 1915. There they expended 24 rounds of 240 mm armor-piercing shells at signal and semaphore stations as well as 74 rounds of 190 mm shells aimed at Italian gun-batteries and other port installations. A major mutiny among crews of the armored cruisers stationed in Cattaro, including and , began on 1 February 1918. Two days later, the three Erzherzog Karl-class ships arrived in the port and assisted with the suppression of the mutiny. Following the restoration of order in the naval base, the armored cruisers Sankt Georg and Kaiser Karl VI were decommissioned and the three Erzherzog Karl-class battleships were stationed in Cattaro in their place. For the morning of 11 June, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy planned a major assault on the Otranto Barrage; the three Erzherzog Karls and the four s were to provide support for the s. The plan was intended to replicate the success of the raid conducted one year earlier. Horthy's plan was to destroy the blockading fleet by luring Allied ships to the cruisers and lighter ships, which were protected from the heavier guns of the battleships, including the Erzherzog Karl class. However, on the morning of 10 June, the dreadnought was torpedoed and sunk by an Italian torpedo boat. Horthy felt surprise had been lost and therefore called off the operation. This was to be the last military action the Erzherzog Karl-class ships were to take part in and they spent the rest of their career at port in Pola. Following the end of World War I in November 1918, the members of the Erzherzog Karl class were first taken over by Yugoslavia in 1919, but Erzherzog Karl and Erzherzog Friedrich were then ceded as war reparations to France. The remaining battleship, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, was ceded to the United Kingdom. However, Erzherzog Karl ran aground at Bizerte on her voyage to Toulon and was eventually broken up in situ. The remaining two battleships were scrapped in 1921.

Navy career Wilhoite enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve on 16 June 1941 at Atlanta, Georgia, and received his aviation indoctrination training at the Naval Reserve Air Base, Atlanta, Georgia. On 7 August, he reported for flight instruction at the Naval Air Station (NAS), Pensacola, Florida, and was appointed an aviation cadet the following day. Transferred to NAS, Miami, Florida, on 15 January 1942 for further training, he became a naval aviator on 6 February. Three days later, he was commissioned an ensign and, at the end of February, reported to the Advanced Carrier Training Group, Atlantic Fleet, NAS, Norfolk, Virginia. There, he joined Fighting Squadron (VF) 9, then fitting out and, in time, became the assistant navigation officer for that squadron. Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, saw VF-9 assigned to the carrier . Each section of the squadron drew assigned tasks on 8 November 1942, the first day of the landings; and Wilhoite flew one of five Grumman F4F-4 Wildcats which attacked the French airdrome at Rabat-Sale, the headquarters of the French air forces in Morocco. Despite heavy antiaircraft fire, he pressed home a determined attack and set three French bombers afire with his guns. Awarded the Silver Star In a second strike directed at the Port Lyautey airdrome later that day, Wilhoite flew as part of the third flight and destroyed one fighter, a Dewoitine 520 by strafing. However, Wilhoite's Wildcat took hits from the intense flak and crashed about one mile from Port Lyautey. Wilhoite received a Silver Star, posthumously, for displaying \\"conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity\\" during the strikes at Rabat-Sale and Port Lyautey. The accompanying citation also cited Wilhoite's \\"superb airmanship and tenacious devotion to duty\\" in pressing home his strafing attacks. Although he was killed in action, Wilhoite had played his part in the significant operations of VF-9 in neutralizing Vichy French air power that, if unhindered, could have severely hampered Operation Torch. Namesake USS Wilhoite (DE-397) was named in his honor. It was laid down on 4 August 1943 at Houston, Texas, by the Brown Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 5 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Corinne M. Wilhoite, the mother of Ensign Wilhoite; and commissioned at Houston on 16 December 1943, Lt. Eli B. Roth in command. The school system at Port Lyautey Naval Air Station, Kenitra, Morocco is also named in his honor. Graduates of TMW High School include four members of the Class of 1967 at the United States Naval Academy, and numerous other service members. Among the awards won by graduates include the Silver Star, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legions of Merit and numerous Distinguished Flying Crosses and Air Medals. Two of the members of the Class of 1963 advanced to the rank of Navy captain.

Sponsored by the United States Customs Service, it was concerned with the surveillance and interdiction of terrorist financing sources. It was disbanded in June 2003 pursuant to an agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.  Synopsis  Led by the U.S. Customs Service, and included agents and analysts from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Secret Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Federal prosecutors from the U.S. Justice Department's Criminal Division also formed an integral part of Operation Green Quest. The director of Operation Green Quest was a senior special agent from U.S. Customs and the deputy director is a senior special agent from the IRS. According to Customs, by its fourth month of Operation Green Quest had initiated more than 300 probes into terrorist finances, seizing about $10.3m in smuggled US currency and $4.3m in other assets. Its work resulted in 21 searches, 12 arrests and four indictments.  SAAR network raid  Its most spectacular operation of was March 20, 2002 raid 19 interrelated business and non-profit entities in Herndon, VA associated with an umbrella corporation known as the SAAR Foundation. No arrests were made and no organizations were shut down, but over 500 boxes of files and computer files were confiscated, filling seven trucks. Finding no incriminating evidence, much of the confiscated material has been returned. The raid raised concerns of unfair persecution within the American Muslim community,Islam Online- News Section leading to an April 4, 2002 meeting in which several notable Muslim figures, including Palestinian-American financier and Republican organizer Talat M. Othman and Islamic Institute head Khaled Saffuri were received by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill as representatives of the Muslim-American community to voice complaints about the raid.  Operation Green Quest disbanded As a result of conflicts between the FBI and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (the successor agency to Customs), in May 2003 the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security signed an agreement concerning terrorist financing investigations. In it, DHS acknowledged that the Department of Justice, through the FBI, was the lead agency in the fight against terrorist financing, and that any terrorist financing investigations would have to be conducted under the auspices of the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force. DHS also agreed to disband Operation Green Quest by June of that year, and not to start any investigations into terrorism or terrorist financing without the permission of the FBI.

In 1975, Callenbach had published a utopian novel called Ecotopia about the events; EE is the prequel, published in 1981. The EE story seems to take place in the 1990s; Callenbach assumes that the pro-business, anti-environmental Reagan-era policies‚Äîalready evident at the time of publication‚Äîwill have persisted in the United States after Reagan's presidency. Ecotopia has been extremely popular and influential. Although EE addresses the question of 'how to get there from here,' it has received much less attention. On its release, Publishers Weekly reviewed it as a ‚Äúyoung adult‚Äù book.Lodge, Sally A. Ecotopia Emerging. Publishers Weekly, October 9, 1981, 220, p. 63. Plot summary EE is mainly a history of the Ecotopian independence movement. The main characters are Vera Allwen, the leader of the Survivalist Party, and Lou Swift, a teenage physicist, along with their families and friends. Other characters are shown briefly as each one decides independently to break with the American status quo and begin living in an Ecotopian (low-tech, sustainable) fashion. Bolinas, California, high school student Lou Swift finds a way to generate electricity cheaply from seawater in a solar cell. However, she doesn‚Äôt understand how the cell works. She refuses to publish her results until she understands the science. Because she is determined to make the cell design freely available, she spurns corporate and academic offers to buy the cell design. Meanwhile, spies and burglars try to obtain her notes. Vera Allwen is a California state senator. Angered by an Eastern food corporation‚Äôs announcement it would stop selling fresh produce, she and other politicians, artists, and professionals form a new political party. It is decentralized, environmentalist, and populist. They create a platform and name it the Survivalist Party. As the book proceeds, they spread their ideas, coalition with like-minded people, and become a regional political force. Vera‚Äôs speeches are reprinted within the text. Some of their ideas come from a short novel called Ecotopia, and the Party publishes a paper called \\"The Survivalist Way to Ecotopia.\\" The Party creates a think tank for environmentalist policies. When the Pacific Northwest states pass a special tax on cars to reduce car use, the U.S. Supreme Court overturns it; public outrage along the Pacific coast helps tip the people of the region toward supporting the Survivalist Party. When the Quebec government offers to establish diplomatic relations, the Party starts thinking about independence. A nuclear accident gives them the governorship of Washington State, and Northern California's refusal to keep supplying Southern California with water leads to the state splitting into two. An ardent secessionist claims to have planted dirty bombs in New York City and Washington, DC, and threatens they will explode if the U.S. attacks the region. Bolinas declares itself independent of other governments. The Survivalist Party has infiltrated local units of the National Guard, which are now sympathetic to the secessionists. The U.S. is too busy with a war in Brazil to send troops to pacify Bolinas and its supporters. In a lucky coincidence, the U.S. helicopters massing on the Nevada border and preparing to attack the region are suddenly recalled to deal with a crisis in Saudi Arabia, and secession seems likely to proceed. Meanwhile, in the future Ecotopia, individuals move the local economy toward a more sustainable model. A collective sets up a solar remodeling business; a young man uses goats to mow lawns. Berkeley creates car-free zones; other cities adopt them. A suburban tract is replanted as an orchard. Rural residents build a lightweight, cheap horse-drawn buggy, and stills to distill alcohol from farm waste. Eventually, a large part of the public is car-free and ready to take the final steps to a sustainable economy. Lou finally discovers the key chemical that makes her solar cell work. She publishes her paper and people start building their own cells. With this breakthrough, the region will no longer be dependent for energy on the rest of the U.S. for imported fossil fuels or nuclear power. With this energy independence, the future nation of Ecotopia becomes a practical possibility. These events occur against economic and political breakdown in the U.S.: corporate concentration, slashed government budgets, and military adventurism abroad, aided by a compliant corporate media. The automobile habit has essentially bankrupted the U.S. Refusing to develop alternative energy sources, ‚Äúoil-hungry America lurched toward some unseen economic catastrophe.‚Äù At the end, the Saudi oil refineries have been bombed, and the U.S. military is caught up in a war in the Middle East. The Ecotopian storyline ends with the Party making Lou‚Äôs solar cell technology available to the public, and a constitutional convention where the region decides to secede from the U.S. following the Quebec-Canada model. The book Ecotopia begins about 20 years after secession, when the new nation is securely established. Neither book describes events in between, such as the political difficulties of secession, the economic dislocations and outmigration from the region, and the Helicopter War with the U.S. (referred to in Ecotopia). Comparison of Ecotopia Emerging and Ecotopia As a prequel to Ecotopia, EE uses some of the same characters as Ecotopia, principally Vera Allwen and Marissa D‚ÄôAmato (later the girlfriend of Ecotopia‚Äôs narrator). However, there are important differences between the books. # The format is different. Ecotopia is the account of a trip to Ecotopia by a U.S. reporter, William Weston, and is told entirely from his point of view. EE alternates a straightforward narrative history of the United States and the Survivalist Party with novelistic snapshots of key events in the lives of some future Ecotopians. # Ecotopia was written in the middle 1970s, when American writers were trying to imagine how to reconstruct society after the 1960s revolutions.Olderman, Raymond M. \\"American Fiction 1974-1976: The People Who Fell to Earth.\\" Contemporary Literature, Vol. 19, No. 4. (Autumn, 1978), pp. 497-530. Available through JSTOR It focuses on the achieved Ecotopian society, not on the problems of the (remaining) United States. EE was published in 1981 and has a darker tone. It focuses as much on the dysfunctional U.S. political and economic system as it does on the actions of the future Ecotopians. Most of its ‚Äòpredictions‚Äô for the U.S. future have turned out to be prescient, such as ‚ÄúFrom the eighties onward the business mentality triumphed.‚Äù (p. 42) # Ecotopia describes a steady-state society. Only the narrator changes as the book progresses. EE is a history; its characters, institutions and society change over time. # Ecotopia has been criticizedJoseph, Pat. \\"Escape from Ecotopia,\\" Grist Magazine, May 12, 2005. for only presenting life in Northern California. EE has a broader scope, and includes all three states. Critical reaction EE has received little critical attention. One critic points out that independence is achieved too easily. \\"In Ecotopia Emerging, the internal contradictions of existing North American capitalism do feature strongly in creating the impetus for change. However, little account is offered of how such dynamics would surely also ensure stubborn resistance to such change (nuclear blackmail notwithstanding) ‚Äì in this emerging ecotopia, big business‚Äôs capitulation to idealists seems abject and fairly complete.‚ÄùPepper, David. \\"Utopianism and environmentalism,\\" Environmental Politics, February 2005, 14:1, pp. 3-22.

He fought during World War I and -after Benito Mussolini took control of Italy- he enrolled in the National Fascist Party. Frusci fought on the southern front for General Rodolfo Graziani during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. In April 1936, during the Battle of the Ogaden, Frusci commanded the center column of three columns attacking the Ethiopian \\"Hindenburg Wall\\". Later Frusci was the commander of the Italian \\"volunteers\\" of the 2nd CCNN Division \\"Fiamme Nere\\" in the Corps of Volunteer Troops (Corpo Truppe Volontarie) during the Spanish Civil War in 1937 and 1938. In 1939 Frusci become Governor of Amhara in northern Ethiopia, and later governor of Italian Eritrea until 1941. During World War II, Frusci was the main military commander in the Italian Eritrea Governorate. As a Lieutenant- General, he commanded Italian forces fighting in Eritrea during the East African Campaign. He fought in the Italian conquest of British Somaliland, conquering the capital Berbera.Photos of the British Somalia conquest, with one at the bottom showing General Frusci In mid-1940, Frusci oversaw the initial Italian attacks into the Sudan, conquering Kassala. Later in 1940, even when ordered to do so, he chose not pull out of the Sudan. Instead, he rebuffed the initial efforts of British and Commonwealth forces to retake the border towns. In November, an assault on Gallabat was stopped short of its goals, the attacking force was hit hard from the air, and the position was re- taken by Italian ground forces. After the British and Commonwealth forces crossed the border and launched an offensive in January 1941, Frusci also oversaw the defensive actions at Agordat, Keren, and the rest of Eritrea. With the fall of Eritrea, Frusci became a prisoner of war. In 1948 Frusci received from the Italian government the award \\"Commendatore dell'Ordine Militare d'Italia\\" Medals given to general/governor Luigi Frusci and the next year he died.

It was one of the very few all-female combat regiments of the Second World War on any side. Led by Captain Lakshmi Swaminathan (better known as Lakshmi Sahgal), the unit was raised in July 1943 with volunteers from the expatriate Indian population in Southeast Asia.Joyce Lebra, Women Against the Raj: The Rani of Jhansi Regiment (2008) ch. 1‚Äì2 The unit was named the Rani of Jhansi Regiment after Lakshmibai, Rani of Jhansi.Edwardes, Michael (1975) Red Year: the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Most of the women were teenage volunteers of Indian descent from Malayan rubber estates; very few had ever been to India.Lebra, ch 2 The initial nucleus of the force was established with its training camp in Singapore with approximately a hundred and seventy cadets. The cadets were given ranks of non-commissioned officer or sepoy (private) according to their education. Later, camps were established in Rangoon and Bangkok and by November 1943, the unit had more than three hundred cadets. Training Training in Singapore began on 23 October 1943. The recruits were divided into sections and platoons and were accorded ranks of Non-Commissioned Officers and Sepoys according to their educational qualifications. These cadets underwent military and combat training with drills, route marches as well as weapons training in rifles, hand grenades, and bayonet charges. Later, a number of the cadets were chosen for more advanced training in jungle warfare in Burma. The Regiment had its first passing out parade at the Singapore training camp of five hundred troops on 30 March 1944. Some 200 of the cadets were also chosen for nursing training, forming the Chand Bibi Nursing Corps.Meeta Deka, Women's agency and social change: Assam and beyond (2013) ch. 4 Service During the INA's Imphal campaign, an initial contingent of nearly a hundred of the Rani of Jhansi troops moved to Maymyo, part of which was intended to form a vanguard unit to enter the Gangetic plains of Bengal after the expected fall of Imphal.

Following the failure of the siege of Imphal and the INA's disastrous retreat, the Rani troops were tasked with coordinating the relief and care of the INA troops who arrived at Monywa and to Maymyo and were not used in combat. End of the regiment After the fall of Rangoon and the withdrawal of the Azad Hind government and Subhas Chandra Bose from the city and through Burma, the troops originally from Burma were allowed to disband, while the remainder of the regiment retreated along with the retreating Japanese forces on foot and, when available, on mechanised transport. During the retreat, it suffered some attacks both from Allied air attacks, as well as from the Burmese resistance forces. The total number of casualties suffered is not known.

It was established by the African-American entrepreneur Pat Chappelle and taken over after his death in 1911 by Fred Swift Wolcott.

Pat Chappelle's Rabbit's Foot Company, 1900‚Äì1911 The company was founded, organised, originally owned and managed by Pat Chappelle (1869‚Äì1911), an African-American former string band guitar player and entrepreneur originally from Jacksonville, Florida, who established a small chain of theatres in the late 1890s.Abbott, Lynn; Seroff, Doug, eds.

Chappelle also opened the Excelsior Hall in Jacksonville, the first black-owned theater in the South, which reportedly seated 500 people. In 1899, he closed the theater and moved to Tampa, where he and the African-American entrepreneur R. S. Donaldson opened a new vaudeville house, the Buckingham, in the Fort Brooke neighborhood, soon followed by a second theatre, the Mascotte. Frank Dumont, writer of the original show, A Rabbit's Foot The success of their shows at the Buckingham and Mascotte theatres led Chappelle and Donaldson to announce their intention, in early 1900, to establish a traveling vaudeville show. Chappelle commissioned Frank Dumont (1848‚Äì1919), of the Eleventh Street Theater in Philadelphia, to write a show for the new company.

Only those with reputation, male, female and juvenile of every description, Novelty Acts, Headliners, etc., for our new play 'A Rabbit's Foot'.... We will travel in our own train of hotel cars, and will exhibit under canvas\\". In summer 1900, Chappelle decided to put the show into theatres rather than under tents, first in Paterson, New Jersey, and then in Brooklyn, New York. However, his bandmaster, Frank Clermont, left the company, his partnership with Donaldson dissolved, and business was poor. In October 1901, the company launched its second season, with a roster of performers again led by the comedian Arthur \\"Happy\\" Howe (1873-1930), and toured in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida. The show grew in popularity throughout the early years of the century, playing in both theatres and tents. Trading as Chappelle Bros.,Peterson, Bernard L. (2001).

Chappelle, rapidly organised a small vaudeville circuit, including theatre venues in Savannah, Georgia, Jacksonville and Tampa. By 1902 it was said that the Chappelle brothers had full control of the African-American vaudeville business in that part of the country, \\"able to give from 12 to 14 weeks [of employment] to at least 75 performers and musicians\\" each season. Chappelle stated, late in 1902, that he had \\"accomplished what no other Negro has done ‚Äì he has successfully run a Negro show without the help of a single white man.\\" As his business grew, he was able to own and manage multiple tent shows, and the Rabbit's Foot Company traveled to as many as sixteen states in a season. Chappelle was known for creating exciting shows, often coordinated with parades, or parades were organized around his show's appearances, and the Rabbit's Foot Company drew large crowds. The shows included minstrel performances, dancers, circus acts including \\"daring aerialists\\", comedy, musical ensembles, drama and classic opera.\\"Rabbit's Foot Comedy Company; T. G.

Chappelle also established an all-black baseball team, which toured with the company and played the local team in each city the company visited. The team operated until at least 1916.

For the 1904‚Äì1905 season, the company included week-long stands in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland. Two of its most popular performers were the singing comedian Charles \\"Cuba\\" Santana and the trombonist Amos Gilliard, though the latter defected to Rusco and Holland's Georgia Minstrels and claimed that Pat Chappelle and his brothers had threatened him at gunpoint before throwing him off the company train. Another performer, William Rainey, brought his young bride, Gertrude - later known as Ma Rainey - to join the company in 1906. That year, Chappelle launched a second travelling tent company, the Funny Folks Comedy Company, with performers alternating between the two companies. The business continued to expand, though, following a dispute, Lewis and James Chappelle left the company around 1907, and in August 1908 one of the Pullman carriages used by the show burned to the ground in Shelby, North Carolina, while several of the vaudeville entertainers were asleep. The fire occurred when one of their horses kicked over a tank of gasoline near a cooking stove. Chappelle quickly ordered a new carriage and eighty-foot round tent so the show could go on the following week.Smith, Peter Dunbaugh (2006).

Wolcott's Original Rabbit's Foot Minstrels, 1912‚Äì1959 Window card for F. S. Wolcott's Original Rabbit's Foot Company The Rabbit's Foot Company was bought in 1912 by Fred Swift Wolcott (1882‚Äì1967), a white farmer originally from Michigan, who owned a small carnival company, F. S. Wolcott Carnivals, and put on a touring show, \\"F. S. Wolcott's Fun Factory\\", based in Columbia, South Carolina.Sampson, Henry T. (2013). Blacks in Blackface: A Sourcebook on Early Black Musical Shows. Scarecrow Press. p. 1167. Wolcott maintained the Rabbit's Foot company as a touring show, initially as both owner and manager, and attracted new talent, including the blues singer Ida Cox, who joined the company in 1913. Ma Rainey also brought the young Bessie Smith into the troupe and worked with her until Smith left in 1915. The show's touring base moved to Wolcott's 1,000-acre Glen Sade Plantation, outside Port Gibson, Mississippi, in 1918, with offices in the center of town. Wolcott began to refer to the show as a \\"minstrel show\\" - a term Chappelle had eschewed. A member of his company, the trombonist Leon \\"Pee Wee\\" Whittaker, described him as \\"a good man\\" who looked after his performers. Each spring, musicians from around the country assembled in Port Gibson to create a musical, comedy, and variety show to perform under canvas. In his book The Story of the Blues, Paul Oliver wrote:Paul Oliver, Paul (1972). The Story of the Blues. . > The 'Foots' travelled in two cars and had an 80' x 110' tent which was > raised by the roustabouts and canvassmen, while a brass band would parade in > town to advertise the coming of the show....The stage would be of boards on > a folding frame and Coleman lanterns ‚Äì gasoline mantle lamps ‚Äì acted as > footlights. There were no microphones; the weaker voiced singers used a > megaphone, but most of the featured women blues singers scorned such aids to > volume. The company, by this time known as F. S. Wolcott's Original Rabbit's Foot Company or F. S. Wolcott‚Äôs Original Rabbit's Foot Minstrels, continued to perform annual tours through the 1920s and 1930s, playing small towns during the week and bigger cities on weekends. Louis Jordan performed with the troupe in the 1920s, sometimes with his father, a bandleader. Other performers with the company in the 1930s included the young Rufus Thomas, George Guesnon, and Leon \\"Pee Wee\\" Whittaker. Later, Maxwell Street Jimmy Davis also toured with the troupe. In 1943 Wolcott placed an advertisement in Billboard, describing the show as \\"the Greatest Colored Show on Earth\\" and seeking \\"Comedians, Singers, Dancers, Chorus Girls, Novelty Acts and Musicians\\".Billboard. June 5, 1943. p. 27. Wolcott remained its general manager and owner until he sold the company in 1950, to Earl Hendren, of Erwin, Tennessee. In turn, Hendren sold the operation in 1955 to Eddie Moran, of Monroe, Louisiana, where it was based in its final years. In 1956, it was reported to be still trading under Wolcott's name and \\"playing under canvas and making mostly one-day stands... bringing live entertainment of a style most show people don't dream still exists and flourishes.\\" The show at that time featured the blues singer Mary Smith and the comedian Memphis Lewis and had a payroll of 50, including a ten- strong band. Performances included \\"up-to-the-minute rock-and-roll\\" and an \\"exotic dancer\\".Parkinson, Tom (1956). \\"Ol' Rabbit Foot Still Hoppin' Thru South\\". Billboard. May 19, 1956. pp. 1, 38. Records suggest that the company's last performance was in 1959. The company's trucks, buses and trailers were seized by the sheriff of Ouachita Parish in Monroe in 1960, under a writ of fieri facias, and sold. \\"Sheriff's Sale...

Her father has left and her mother works both as a barmaid and prostitute and they live in a noisy roadside apartment. We meet her again at age 18, living with her mother in a suburb of Paris and working at a hair salon near St. Lazare train station. At night mother and daughter watch TV or Apple reads romance novels and magazines. Her first friend in Paris is Marilyn, a 30-year-old redhead who is unsuccessfully modeling her life after a romance novel. She tries to make Apple more like herself, gets her to drink whiskey and wear makeup, but she begrudges Apple's simplicity and the friendship doesn't survive the entrance of Marilyn's next boyfriend. Marilyn abandons Apple while the two friends are vacationing in Cabourg. Apple is left eating an ice cream at a tea shop when Aimery de B√©ligny shows up. Aimery is initially fascinated by Apple's simplicity. An intellectual from a respectable family, he is different from Apple in every way. Her docile sincerity charms him at first; they live together in his studio in Paris where she expresses her devotion through continuous housework. But such humble tenderness only irritates the student, who thinks the intellectual gap between them is too profound. He breaks up with her and leaves. Apple takes off her rubber gloves, puts away her cleanser and leaves without complaint. She returns to her mother's convinced that she is unworthy and ugly and she loses what interest she had in life. She stops eating and ends up in a mental hospital. Apple is surrounded with characters who believe they know how to express themselves, while she remains mute. Her silent suffering is the central light of the book, like the candle in Vermeer's painting.

She and her sister were independently wealthy, their fortune inherited from the businesses created by their grandfather, the industrialist David Davies. Davies and her sister created one of the most important private collections of art in Britain and donated their total of 260 works to what is now the National Museum Wales in the mid-20th century. Early life and education Gwendoline Davies was born at Llandinam, daughter of Edward Davies and his wife Mary, who was the daughter of Evan Jones, a Calvinistic Methodist minister. Edward was the only son of the industrialist and philanthropist David Davies. Gwendoline's brother David Davies, 1st Baron Davies, was elevated to the Peerage in 1932 and her sister was Margaret. Both girls were educated at Highfield School in Hendon. Arts patronage =Art collection= About 1908 while travelling in Europe, the sisters began to collect art. In particular, they purchased many works by the Impressionists and post-Impressionists, although they also acquired holdings of 20th-century modern artists, such as Josef Herman, Oskar Kokoschka, Augustus John, Stanley Spencer, Frank Brangwyn, and Eric Gill. Hugh Blaker, art collector who was curator of the Holburne Museum from 1905 ‚Äì 1913 was an adviser to the Davies sisters and assisted in securing their vast art collection.http://www.holburne.org/events/i-am-art-in-bath/ Gwendoline and Margaret Davies bought the mansion of Gregynog just after the First World War, and set up an arts centre there. In 1923 the sisters launched the Gregynog Press, printing fine limited editions in both English and Welsh. =Music patronage - Gregynog Music Festival= Whereas art was Margaret's passion, Gwen was a talented amateur musician. From 1933 to 1938, they sponsored the Gregynog Music Festival at their estate, a 3‚Äì4-day affair that included poetry readings. The festivals played host to important composers and other musical figures of the period, including Ralph Vaughan Williams, Edward Elgar, Gustav Holst, \\"the conductor Adrian Boult, and the poet Lascelles Abercrombie; and performers including Jelly d'Ar√°nyi and the Rothschild Quartet.\\"Ragor: \\"Gregynog: Arts and Music for Wales\\" , National Museum Wales, accessed 13 October 2010 The sisters ended the festival during the build-up to the Second World War. It was revived during 1955‚Äì1961 by Ian Parrott, who was Gregynog Professor of Music at Aberystwyth for more than 30 years. The festival was revived again in 1988 by the tenor Anthony Rolfe Johnson. It continues under Rhian Davies's direction. Later life Neither of the sisters married. Gwen died in Oxford. Her ashes were buried at her birthplace of Llandinam, as were her sister's after her death in 1963. Art legacy In 1953 and 1961, the Davies sisters' collection of 260 works was bequeathed to the National Museum of Wales, forming the nucleus in the mid-20th century of its international art collection and greatly expanding its range. It has been called \\"one of the great British art collections of the 20th century.\\"Art: \\"Davies Sisters Collection\\", National Museum Wales, accessed 29 September 2010 Among these were seven oil paintings that had been bought as Turners (including The Beacon Light).Wales Online Three of these were subsequently judged to be fake and withdrawn from display.

He also works in the administration of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Education Cohen graduated from Bronx High School of Science. He obtained his bachelor's degree in the interdisciplinary honors Social Studies program from Harvard College in 1984 and received his law degree in 1987 from Harvard Law School where he was the president of the Harvard Law Review. Career After graduating from Harvard Law School, Cohen clerked for Judge Abner Mikva on the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and then served as a lawyer for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama. Cohen subsequently worked as a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in New York City. While at the ACLU, he focused on school finance and educational equity issues and was part of the legal team that brought an Alabama state court class action in 1991, claiming that the public school system violated the state constitution by failing to provide an equitable, adequate or \\"liberal\\" education. In 1993 the state courts ruled in favor of the ACLU and the children plaintiffs in Harper v. Hunt, finding that poor schools were not equitably funded. The lower court decision was reviewed in the federal courts. During his tenure as Alabama Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, later President Donald Trump's Attorney General of the United States, fought against the findings of the Alabama courts. Sessions was ultimately successful in his campaign to prevent schools in poorer Alabama communities from being funded at the same level as schools in wealthier districts. After leaving the ACLU, Cohen spent seven years as a senior writer for TIME magazine, until he left to become a member of The New York Times editorial board. During his tenure at the Times, from 2002 until 2010, Cohen's editorials focused on tech and legal affairs. After leaving The New York Times, he became a lecturer in law at Yale Law School and a fellow at the Yale Information Society Project, teaching courses in media and internet law. He also wrote a legal column which appeared in TIME.com every Monday. Beginning in 2011, Cohen also served as Special Policy Advisor to New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo. In 2014 Cohen joined New York City Mayor de Blasio's administration as Chief Speechwriter. In 2015 he moved to the mayor's Center for Economic Opportunity, as a Special Policy Advisor. Along with Elizabeth Taylor, the literary editor of the Chicago Tribune and Cohen's co-author of American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J. Daley, His Battle for Chicago and the Nation, Cohen is also co-editor of The National Book Review (thenationalbookreview.com). In 2017, Cohen was a Pulitzer Prize juror in the category of criticism and in 2018 he was a juror in the category of Feature Writing. Cohen is the author of five books. The most recent, Supreme Inequality: The Supreme Court's Fifty-Year Battle for a More Unjust America, argues that the United States Supreme Court turned away from protecting the poor and weak and from advancing a more just and equal society across broad and diverse areas of law (Education, Poverty, Campaign Finance, Democracy, Workers' Rights, Corporations, and Criminal Justice), reversing the course the law had been on under the jurisprudence of the Warren Court. This reversal occurred in the aftermath of Chief Justice Earl Warren's retirement and President Richard Nixon's successful bid‚Äîdeemed a ruthless and baseless \\"squeeze play\\" by Cohen‚Äîto force liberal Justice Abe Fortas off the Court by threatening federal investigations of Fortas and his wife. Nixon went on to appoint four conservative Justices (new Chief Justice Warren Burger, future Chief Justice William Rehnquist, then-conservative Associate Justice Harry Blackmun, and Associate Justice Lewis Powell). Calling the book \\"impressive and necessary,\\" The New York Times praises Cohen's \\"sweeping review\\" as showing that \\"the Court has repeatedly engaged in judicial activism against the poor,\\" aggressively exacerbating income inequality in the United States. Cohen sums up the result of fifty years of jurisprudence in the areas he explores, writing that \\"the post-1969 Court has been working unrelentingly to protect the wealthy and powerful, and to make [the United States] more hierarchical and exclusionary - and it has been succeeding. When it comes to the law, and its many consequences for society, we are all living in Nixon's America now.\\" Cohen's previous book, Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck, was named to the longlist for the 2016 National Book Award, and is slated to be made into an Amazon film, Unfit, starring Dakota Johnson.

Ireland currently has four entries in the Pro14. Ireland also has a domestic competition the All Ireland League and Provincial Leagues run by the different provincial branches of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU). Pro14 The league now known as the Pro14 was created in 2001 as the Celtic League with 15 teams from the Celtic nations‚Äîthe four Irish provinces, teams from both of Scotland's largest cities, and all nine teams from the Welsh Premier Division. After the first season, a third Scottish team, representing the Borders region, joined. The league saw radical change for the 2003‚Äì04 season, as the Welsh Rugby Union adopted a controversial plan to regionalise the country's professional rugby setup. The existing professional clubs were reorganised into five regional sides and the Welsh Premier Division was demoted to a developmental league. One of the original Welsh regional teams was folded after that season, resulting in an 11-team league. In 2006, the competition became the Magners League via a sponsorship deal with Irish cider maker Magners. After the 2006‚Äì07 season, the Scottish Rugby Union folded the Borders side for financial reasons, leaving the league with 10 members. The league expanded to include two Italian super-regional franchises starting with the 2010‚Äì11 season, which proved to be the last under Magners sponsorship. The league found a new sponsor in RaboDirect, the Irish subsidiary of Dutch financial services company Rabobank. Since its inception, the Celtic League/Pro12 has been a closed league with no promotion or relegation. Under current rules, the three Irish teams that finish highest in the league receive berths in the following season's Heineken Cup, with the remaining provincial side taking part in the European Challenge Cup. Starting with the 2009‚Äì10 season, the winners of both European cups have earned berths in the following season's Heineken Cup separately from their countries' normal allocations. From the inception of the Celtic League through the 2010‚Äì11 season, the three traditional provincial powers of Leinster, Munster and Ulster claimed all of Ireland's Heineken Cup places, leaving Connacht to carry the country's banner in the Challenge Cup. In 2011‚Äì12, all four of Ireland's provinces competed in the Heineken Cup; Leinster's victory in the 2011 Heineken Cup Final gave Ireland a fourth Heineken Cup berth, which passed to Connacht as Leinster were already qualified via the Celtic League. All Ireland League The main domestic league in Ireland is the All Ireland League. This was started in 1990 and has now expanded to three divisions with a total of 52 senior clubs. The champion of Division 1A and of the All Ireland League is decided by a set of playoffs played at the conclusion of the 18 game regular season. The winner of this set of playoffs becomes All Ireland League champions for that season. The bottom club in Division One A IS relegated to Division One B to be replaced by the top club from Division One B with second bottom in Division One A playing off against second in Division One B. The bottom two from Division One B are replaced by the top two from Division Two A. The bottom two teams in Division Two A are relegated to Division Two B and third bottom in Division Two A plays off against third in Division Two B. The bottom club in Division Two B is relegated to the top division of junior rugby in their division while the team that finishes second bottom in Division Two B playoffs off against the team that finishes second in the round robin competition between the winners of the four provincial junior leagues See also * Rugby union in Ireland References  ","title":"Irish rugby union system"},{"id":"12255092","text":"The Educational Media Company at Virginia Tech (EMCVT) is an independent governing body over student mass media organizations of the Virginia Tech campus.

It has the alternative English title Faithful Heart. The film tells a melodramatic story of thwarted romance, set against a background of the Marseille docks, and experiments with many techniques of camerawork and editing. Plot Marie (Gina Man√®s) was an orphan adopted by a bar-owner and his wife in the port of Marseille, and now she is harshly exploited by them as a servant in the bar. She is desired by Petit Paul (Edmond van Da√´le), a thuggish layabout, but is secretly in love with Jean (L√©on Mathot), a dockworker. Marie is forced to leave with Petit Paul, but Jean follows them to a fairground where the two men fight. In the brawl a policeman is stabbed and, while Petit Paul escapes, Jean is arrested and gaoled. A year later, Jean rediscovers Marie, now with a sick baby and living with Petit Paul, who spends all their money on drink. Jean tries to support Marie, aided by a crippled woman (Marie Epstein, credited as \\"Mlle Marice\\"), who lives next door; but Petit Paul, warned by gossiping neighbours that Jean is seeing Marie, returns for a violent confrontation, this time armed with a gun. In the ensuing struggle, the crippled woman obtains the gun and kills Petit Paul. In an epilogue, we see Jean and Marie finally free to love each other, though their faces suggest that experience has taken its toll on their lives. Production and style Jean Epstein had already established himself as a film theorist with the publication of several books, and he had begun to explore his ideas in practice with his first two films, Pasteur (1922) and L'Auberge rouge (1923). Epstein now chose to film a simple story of love and violence \\"to win the confidence of those, still so numerous, who believe that only the lowest melodrama can interest the public\\", and also in the hope of creating \\"a melodrama so stripped of all the conventions ordinarily attached to the genre, so sober, so simple, that it might approach the nobility and excellence of tragedy\\".Jean Epstein. Pr√©sentation de \\"C≈ìur fid√®le\\", in √âcrits sur le cin√©ma, 1, 124 (jan. 1924) [quoted in Richard Abel, French cinema: the first wave 1915-1929 (Princeton University Press, 1984), p.360. He wrote the scenario in a single night. Epstein had been much impressed by Abel Gance's recently completed La Roue, and in C≈ìur fid√®le he similarly applied rhythmic editing, overlays, close-ups, and point-of-view shots. The opening sequence establishes Marie's situation in the harbour bar through montage: we see close-up images of her face, hands, and the table and glasses she is cleaning. Later, images of the sea and the port are intercut and overlaid to convey her relationship with Jean. The film's most celebrated sequence, set at a fairground, employs rhythmic editing to chart the escalating tension of the love triangle. In the film's second half, Epstein employs dramatic lighting effects and lens distortion effects to convey the melodrama of the situation, as well as subjective states, such as Petit Paul's drinking. The film's technical experiments are balanced throughout by the realism of the setting. The characters are unglamorous and belong to a working-class milieu, living in cheap lodgings, frequenting rough bar-rooms. C≈ìur fid√®le is one of several early films to use the location of the Marseille dockside (in the wake of Louis Delluc's Fi√®vre, and looking forward to Alberto Cavalcanti's En rade), and the evocative images of looming ships and deserted wharfs contribute to a style which would be characterized over the next decade and a half as \\"poetic realism\\" (cf. L'Atalante, Quai des brumes (Port of Shadows)). Reception The film was not a success with the public. Its initial run in Paris in 1923 was terminated after three days (because of disputes among the audience). A re-release in the following year saw a steady decline in the size of its audience.Richard Abel, French cinema: the first wave, 1915-1929. (Princeton University Press, 1984). p.359. Among critics and other film-makers however C≈ìur fid√®le attracted considerable attention and has continued to do so. Georges Sadoul said that the film \\"was a sensation, and was to remain [Epstein's] best film\\"; \\"it touches us still by its fidelity to everyday life\\".Georges Sadoul, Le cin√©ma fran√ßais, (Flammarion, 1962): \\"C≈ìur fid√®le fit sensation, et devait rester sa meilleure oeuvre.\\" (p.29); \\"Et C≈ìur fid√®le nous touche encore, par sa fid√©lit√© au quotidien.\\" (p.30) Ren√© Clair wrote enthusiastically about it: \\" C≈ìur fid√®le must be seen if you want to understand the resources of the cinema today. ...For a film to be worthy of the cinema, that's already a very welcome miracle!

The independent nation collected taxes on imports (\\"tariffs\\"), whiskey, and (for a while) on glass windows. States and localities collected poll taxes on voters and property taxes on land and commercial buildings. In addition, there were the state and federal excise taxes. State and federal inheritance taxes began after 1900, while the states (but not the federal government) began collecting sales taxes in the 1930s. The United States imposed income taxes briefly during the Civil War and the 1890s. In 1913, the 16th Amendment was ratified, permanently legalizing an income tax. Federal taxes by type  Colonial taxation  A British newspaper cartoon reacts to the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1765. Taxes were low at the local, colonial and imperial levels throughout the colonial era. The issue that led to the Revolution was whether parliament had the right to impose taxes on the Americans when they were not represented in parliament.  Stamp Act  The Stamp Act of 1765 was the fourth Stamp Act to be passed by the Parliament of Great Britain and required all legal documents, permits, commercial contracts, newspapers, wills, pamphlets, and playing cards in the American colonies to carry a tax stamp. It was enacted on November 1, 1765, at the end of the Seven Years' War between the French and the British, a war that started with the young officer George Washington attacking a French outpost. The stamp tax had the scope of defraying the cost of maintaining the military presence protecting the colonies. Americans rose up in strong protest, arguing in terms of \\"No Taxation without Representation\\". Boycotts forced Britain to repeal the stamp tax, while convincing many British leaders it was essential to tax the colonists on something in order to demonstrate the sovereignty of Parliament. = Townshend Revenue Act = The Townshend Revenue Act were two tax laws passed by Parliament in 1767; they were proposed by Charles Townshend, Chancellor of the Exchequer. They placed a tax on common products imported into the American Colonies, such as lead, paper, paint, glass, and tea. In contrast to the Stamp Act of 1765, the laws were not a direct tax that people paid daily, but a tax on imports that was collected from the ship's captain when he unloaded the cargo. The Townshend Acts also created three new admiralty courts to try Americans who ignored the laws. = Sugar Act 1764 = This 1846 lithograph has become a classic image of the Boston Tea Party. The tax on sugar, cloth, and coffee. These were non-British exports. = Tea Act of 1773 = The Tea Act of 1773 received the royal assent on May 10, 1773. This act was a \\"drawback on duties and tariffs\\" on tea. The act was designed to undercut tea smugglers to the benefit of the East India Company. = Boston Tea Party = The Boston Tea Party was an act of protest by the American colonists against Great Britain for the Tea Act in which they dumped many chests of tea into Boston Harbor. The cuts to taxation on tea undermined American smugglers, who destroyed the tea in retaliation for its exemption from taxes. Britain reacted harshly, and the conflict escalated to war in 1775.  Capitation tax  An assessment levied by the government upon a person at a fixed rate regardless of income or worth.  Tariffs  = Income for federal government = Tariffs have played different parts in trade policy and the economic history of the United States. Tariffs were the largest source of federal revenue from the 1790s to the eve of World War I, until it was surpassed by income taxes. Since the revenue from the tariff was considered essential and easy to collect at the major ports, it was agreed the nation should have a tariff for revenue purposes.Miller, 1960, p. 15Hamilton Tariff#Import Duty Legislation and American Sectional Interests = Protectionism = Another role the tariff played was in the protection of local industry; it was the political dimension of the tariff. From the 1790s to the present day, the tariff (and closely related issues such as import quotas and trade treaties) generated enormous political stresses. These stresses lead to the Nullification crisis during the 19th century, and the creation of the World Trade Organization.  Origins of protectionism  When Alexander Hamilton was the United States Secretary of the Treasury he issued the Report on Manufactures, which reasoned that applying tariffs in moderation, in addition to raising revenue to fund the federal government, would also encourage domestic manufacturing and growth of the economy by applying the funds raised in part towards subsidies (called bounties in his time) to manufacturers. The main purposes sought by Hamilton through the tariff were to: (1) protect American infant industry for a short term until it could compete; (2) raise revenue to pay the expenses of government; (3) raise revenue to directly support manufacturing through bounties (subsidies).Report on Manufactures This resulted in the passage of three tariffs by Congress, the Tariff of 1789, the Tariff of 1790, and the Tariff of 1792 which progressively increased tariffs.  Sectionalism  Tariffs contributed to sectionalism between the North and the South. The Tariff of 1824 increased tariffs in order to protect the American industry in the face of cheaper imported commodities such as iron products, wool, and cotton textiles, and agricultural goods from England. This tariff was the first in which the sectional interests of the North and the South truly came into conflict because the South advocated lower tariffs in order to take advantage of tariff reciprocity from England and other countries that purchased raw agricultural materials from the South. The Tariff of 1828, also known as the Tariff of Abominations, and the Tariff of 1832 accelerated sectionalism between the North and the South. For a brief moment in 1832, South Carolina made vague threats to leave the Union over the tariff issue.Tariff of 1832 In 1833, to ease North-South relations, Congress lowered the tariffs. In the 1850s, the South gained greater influence over tariff policy and made subsequent reductions.Tariff of 1857 In 1861, just prior to the Civil War, Congress enacted the Morrill Tariff, which applied high rates and inaugurated a period of relatively continuous trade protection in the United States that lasted until the Underwood Tariff of 1913. The schedule of the Morrill Tariff and its two successor bills were retained long after the end of the Civil War.Frank Taussig  Early 20th century protectionism  In 1921, Congress sought to protect local agriculture as opposed to industry by passing the Emergency Tariff, which increased rates on wheat, sugar, meat, wool and other agricultural products brought into the United States from foreign nations, which provided protection for domestic producers of those items. However, one year later Congress passed another tariff, the Fordney‚ÄìMcCumber Tariff, which applied the scientific tariff and the American Selling Price. The purpose of the scientific tariff was to equalize production costs among countries so that no country could undercut the prices charged by American companies.Fordney‚ÄìMcCumber Tariff The difference of production costs was calculated by the Tariff Commission. A second novelty was the American Selling Price. This allowed the president to calculate the duty based on the price of the American price of a good, not the imported good. During the outbreak of the Great Depression in 1930, Congress raised tariffs via the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act on over 20,000 imported goods to record levels, and, in the opinion of most economists, worsened the Great Depression by causing other countries to reciprocate thereby plunging American imports and exports by more than half.  Era of GATT and WTO  In 1948, the US signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which reduced tariff barriers and other quantitative restrictions and subsidies on trade through a series of agreements. In 1993, the GATT was updated (GATT 1994) to include new obligations upon its signatories. One of the most significant changes was the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Whereas GATT was a set of rules agreed upon by nations, the WTO is an institutional body. The WTO expanded its scope from traded goods to trade within the service sector and intellectual property rights. Although it was designed to serve multilateral agreements, during several rounds of GATT negotiations (particularly the Tokyo Round) plurilateral agreements created selective trading and caused fragmentation among members. WTO arrangements are generally a multilateral agreement settlement mechanism of GATT.  Excise tax  The Whiskey Rebellion: The painting depicts George Washington and his troops near Fort Cumberland, Maryland, before their march to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania. Federal excise taxes are applied to specific items such as motor fuels, tires, telephone usage, tobacco products, and alcoholic beverages. Excise taxes are often, but not always, allocated to special funds related to the object or activity taxed. During the presidency of George Washington, Alexander Hamilton proposed a tax on distilled spirits to fund his policy of assuming the war debt of the American Revolution for those states which had failed to pay. After a vigorous debate, the House decided by a vote of 35‚Äì21 to approve legislation imposing a seven-cent-per-gallon excise tax on whiskey. This marks the first time in American history that Congress voted to tax an American product; this led to the Whiskey Rebellion.  Income tax  Federal, State, and Local income tax GDP The history of income taxation in the United States began in the 19th century with the imposition of income taxes to fund war efforts. However, the constitutionality of income taxation was widely held in doubt (see Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.) until 1913 with the ratification of the 16th Amendment. = Legal foundations = Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution assigns Congress the power to impose \\"Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises\\", but Article I, Section 8 requires that \\"Duties, Imposts, and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States\\". In addition, the Constitution specifically limited Congress' ability to impose direct taxes, by requiring it to distribute direct taxes in proportion to each state's census population. It was thought that head taxes and property taxes (slaves could be taxed as either or both) were likely to be abused and that they bore no relation to the activities in which the federal government had a legitimate interest. The fourth clause of section 9, therefore, specifies that \\"No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken\\". Taxation was also the subject of Federalist No. 33 penned secretly by the Federalist Alexander Hamilton under the pseudonym Publius. In it, he explains that the wording of the \\"Necessary and Proper\\" clause should serve as guidelines for the legislation of laws regarding taxation. The legislative branch is to be the judge, but any abuse of those powers of judging can be overturned by the people, whether as states or as a larger group. What seemed to be a straightforward limitation on the power of the legislature based on the subject of the tax proved inexact and unclear when applied to an income tax, which can be arguably viewed either as a direct or an indirect tax. The courts have generally held that direct taxes are limited to taxes on people (variously called \\"capitation\\", \\"poll tax\\" or \\"head tax\\") and property.Penn Mutual Indemnity Co. v. Commissioner, 227 F.2d 16, 19‚Äì20 (3rd Cir. 1960) All other taxes are commonly referred to as \\"indirect taxes\\".See generally Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, , 581‚Äì582. = Pre-16th Amendment = In order to help pay for its war effort in the American Civil War, Congress imposed its first personal income tax in 1861.Joseph A. Hill, \\"The Civil War Income Tax,\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics Vol. 8, No. 4 (Jul., 1894), pp. 416-452 in JSTOR; appendix in JSTOR It was part of the Revenue Act of 1861 (3% of all incomes over US$800; rescinded in 1872). Congress also enacted the Revenue Act of 1862, which levied a 3% tax on incomes above $600, rising to 5% for incomes above $10,000. Rates were raised in 1864. This income tax was repealed in 1872. A new income tax statute was enacted as part of the 1894 Tariff Act.Charles F. Dunbar, \\"The New Income Tax,\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics Vol. 9, No. 1 (Oct., 1894), pp. 26-46 in JSTORTariff Act, Ch. 349, 28 Stat. 509 (August 15, 1894). At that time, the United States Constitution specified that Congress could impose a \\"direct\\" tax only if the law apportioned that tax among the states according to each state's census population.Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 (as modified by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment) and Article I, Section 9, Clause 4. In 1895, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., that taxes on rents from real estate, on interest income from personal property and other income from personal property (which includes dividend income) were direct taxes on property and therefore had to be apportioned. Since the apportionment of income taxes is impractical, the Pollock rulings had the effect of prohibiting a federal tax on income from property. Due to the political difficulties of taxing individual wages without taxing income from property, a federal income tax was impractical from the time of the Pollock decision until the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (below). = 16th Amendment = National Archives In response to the Supreme Court decision in the Pollock case, Congress proposed the Sixteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1913,According to the United States Government Printing Office, a total of 42 states have ratified the Amendment. See Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America . and which states: > The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from > whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and > without regard to any census or enumeration. The Supreme Court in Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad, , indicated that the Sixteenth Amendment did not expand the federal government's existing power to tax income (meaning profit or gain from any source) but rather removed the possibility of classifying an income tax as a direct tax on the basis of the source of the income. The Amendment removed the need for the income tax on interest, dividends, and rents to be apportioned among the states on the basis of population. Income taxes are required, however, to abide by the law of geographical uniformity. Congress enacted an income tax in October 1913 as part of the Revenue Act of 1913, levying a 1% tax on net personal incomes above $3,000, with a 6% surtax on incomes above $500,000. By 1918, the top rate of the income tax was increased to 77% (on income over $1,000,000, equivalent of $16,717,815 in 2018 dollars) to finance World War I. The average rate for the rich however, was 15%. The top marginal tax rate was reduced to 58% in 1922, to 25% in 1925 and finally to 24% in 1929. In 1932 the top marginal tax rate was increased to 63% during the Great Depression and steadily increased, reaching 94% in 1944 (on income over $200,000, equivalent of $2,868,625 in 2018 dollars). During World War II, Congress introduced payroll withholding and quarterly tax payments. = Tax rate reductions = A comedic representation by Clifford K. Berryman of the debate to introduce a sales tax in the United States in 1933 and end the income tax Following World War II tax increases, top marginal individual tax rates stayed near or above 90%, and the effective tax rate at 70% for the highest incomes (few paid the top rate), until 1964 when the top marginal tax rate was lowered to 70%. Kennedy explicitly called for a top rate of 65 percent, but added that it should be set at 70 percent if certain deductions weren't phased out at the top of the income scale. The top marginal tax rate was lowered to 50% in 1982 and eventually to 28% in 1988. It slowly increased to 39.6% in 2000, then was reduced to 35% for the period 2003 through 2012. Corporate tax rates were lowered from 48% to 46% in 1981 (PL 97-34), then to 34% in 1986 (PL 99-514), and increased to 35% in 1993, then 21% in 2018. Timothy Noah, the senior editor of the New Republic, argues that while Ronald Reagan made massive reductions in the nominal marginal income tax rates with his Tax Reform Act of 1986, this reform did not make a similarly massive reduction in the effective tax rate on the higher marginal incomes. Noah writes in his ten-part series entitled \\"The Great Divergence,\\" that in 1979, the effective tax rate on the top 0.01 percent of taxpayers was 42.9 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, but that by Reagan's last year in office it was 32.2%. This effective rate on high incomes held steadily until the first few years of the Clinton presidency when it increased to a peak high of 41%. However, it fell back down to the low 30s by his second term in the White House. This percentage reduction in the effective marginal income tax rate for the wealthiest Americans, 9%, is not a very large decrease in their tax burden, according to Noah, especially in comparison to the 20% drop in nominal rates from 1980 to 1981 and the 15% drop in nominal rates from 1986 to 1987. In addition to this small reduction on the income taxes of the wealthiest taxpayers in America, Noah discovered that the effective income tax burden for the bottom 20% of wage earners was 8% in 1979 and dropped to 6.4% under the Clinton Administration. This effective rate further dropped under the George W. Bush Administration. Under Bush, the rate decreased from 6.4% to 4.3%. _Looking at the simple math, reductions in the effective income tax burden on the poor coinciding with modest reductions in the effective income tax rate on the wealthiest 0.01% of taxpayers could not alone have been the direct cause of increased income inequality that began in the 1980s._ Noah, Timothy. \\"The United States of Inequality.\\" Slate.com. The Slate Group, 9 Sept. 2010. Web. 16 Nov. 2011. These figures also correspond to an analysis of effective tax rates from 1979‚Äì2005 by the Congressional Budget Office. [Note that this statement is a conclusion and not a historical fact, and it is based on selective calculations. Interpretations are inappropriate in an article that is presented as a historical account.] = Development of the modern income tax = Historical federal right Congress re-adopted the income tax in 1913, levying a 1% tax on net personal incomes above $3,000, with a 6% surtax on incomes above $500,000. By 1918, the top rate of the income tax was increased to 77% (on income over $1,000,000) to finance World War I. The top marginal tax rate was reduced to 58% in 1922, to 25% in 1925, and finally to 24% in 1929. In 1932 the top marginal tax rate was increased to 63% during the Great Depression and steadily increased. During World War II, Congress introduced payroll withholding and quarterly tax payments. In pursuit of equality (rather than revenue) President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a 100% tax on all incomes over $25,000.W. Elliott Brownlee, Federal Taxation in America: A Short History, pp. 109-10, Woodrow Wilson Center Press (2004), citing Congressional Record, 78th Congress, 1st Session, vol. 89, p. 4448. (U.S. Gov't Printing Office 1942).Jeff Haden, \\"How would you feel about a 94% tax rate?\\", Dec. 7, 2011, Moneywatch, CBS News, at . When Congress did not enact that proposal, Roosevelt issued an executive order attempting to achieve a similar result through a salary cap on certain salaries in connection with contracts between the private sector and the federal government... For tax years 1944 through 1951, the highest marginal tax rate for individuals was 91%, increasing to 92% for 1952 and 1953, and reverting to 91% for tax years 1954 through 1963.See Tax Rate Schedules, Instructions for Form 1040, years 1944 through 1963, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury. For the 1964 tax year, the top marginal tax rate for individuals was lowered to 77%, and then to 70% for tax years 1965 through 1981. In 1978 income brackets were adjusted for inflation, so fewer people were taxed at high rates. The top marginal tax rate was lowered to 50% for tax years 1982 through 1986.See Tax Rate Schedules, Instructions for Form 1040, years 1964 through 1986, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury. Reagan undid 40% of his 1981 tax cut, in 1983 he hiked gas and payroll taxes, and in 1984 he raised tax revenue by closing loopholes for businesses. According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's 12 tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut. For tax year 1987, the highest marginal tax rate was 38.5% for individuals.See Tax Rate Schedule, Instructions for Form 1040, year 1987, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury. It was lowered to 28% in revenue neutral fashion, eliminating many loopholes and shelters, along with in corporate taxes, (with a 33% \\"bubble rate\\") for tax years 1988 through 1990.See Tax Rate Schedules, Instructions for Form 1040, years 1988 through 1990, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/federalindividualratehistory-200901021.pdf Ultimately, the combination of base broadening and rate reduction raised revenue equal to about 4% of existing tax revenue For the 1991 and 1992 tax years, the top marginal rate was increased to 31% in a budget deal President George H. W. Bush made with the Congress.See Tax Rate Schedules, Instructions for Form 1040, years 1991 through 1992, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury. In 1993 the Clinton administration proposed and the Congress accepted (with no Republican support) an increase in the top marginal rate to 39.6% for the 1993 tax year, where it remained through tax year 2000.See Tax Rate Schedules, Instructions for Form 1040, years 1993 through 2000, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.

Bush proposed and Congress accepted an eventual lowering of the top marginal rate to 35%. However, this was done in stages: with a highest marginal rate of 39.1% for 2001, then 38.6% for 2002 and finally 35% for years 2003 through 2010.See Tax Rate Schedules, Instructions for Form 1040, years 2001 through 2009, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, and Instructions for 2010 Form 1040-ES, Internal Revenue Service, Dep't of the Treasury. This measure had a sunset provision and was scheduled to expire for the 2011 tax year when rates would have returned to those adopted during the Clinton years unless Congress changed the law;See generally Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-16, sec. 901 (June 2, 2001). Congress did so by passing the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, signed by President Barack Obama on December 17, 2010. At first, the income tax was incrementally expanded by the Congress of the United States, and then inflation automatically raised most persons into tax brackets formerly reserved for the wealthy until income tax brackets were adjusted for inflation. Income tax now applies to almost two-thirds of the population.Income tax collection, Internal Revenue Service The lowest-earning workers, especially those with dependents, pay no income taxes as a group and actually get a small subsidy from the federal government because of child credits and the Earned Income Tax Credit. While the government was originally funded via tariffs upon imported goods, tariffs now represent only a minor portion of federal revenues. Non-tax fees are generated to recompense agencies for services or to fill specific trust funds such as the fee placed upon airline tickets for airport expansion and air traffic control. Often the receipts intended to be placed in \\"trust\\" funds are used for other purposes, with the government posting an IOU ('I owe you') in the form of a federal bond or other accounting instrument, then spending the money on unrelated current expenditures. Net long-term capital gains as well as certain types of qualified dividend income are taxed preferentially. The federal government collects several specific taxes in addition to the general income tax. Social Security and Medicare are large social support programs which are funded by taxes on personal earned income (see below). = Treatment of \\"income\\" = Tax statutes passed after the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 are sometimes referred to as the \\"modern\\" tax statutes. Hundreds of Congressional acts have been passed since 1913, as well as several codifications (i.e., topical reorganizations) of the statutes (see Codification). The modern interpretation of the Sixteenth Amendment taxation power can be found in Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co. . In that case, a taxpayer had received an award of punitive damages from a competitor and sought to avoid paying taxes on that award. The U.S. Supreme Court observed that Congress, in imposing the income tax, had defined income to include: > gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for > personal service ... of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from > professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings > in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use > of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, > securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or > profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.348 > U.S. at 429 The Court held that \\"this language was used by Congress to exert in this field the full measure of its taxing power\\", id., and that \\"the Court has given a liberal construction to this broad phraseology in recognition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted.\\"Id. at 430. The Court then enunciated what is now understood by Congress and the Courts to be the definition of taxable income, \\"instances of undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.\\" Id. at 431. The defendant, in that case, suggested that a 1954 rewording of the tax code had limited the income that could be taxed, a position which the Court rejected, stating: > The definition of gross income has been simplified, but no effect upon its > present broad scope was intended. Certainly, punitive damages cannot > reasonably be classified as gifts, nor do they come under any other > exemption provision in the Code. We would do violence to the plain meaning > of the statute and restrict a clear legislative attempt to bring the taxing > power to bear upon all receipts constitutionally taxable were we to say that > the payments in question here are not gross income.Id. at 432-33. In Conner v. The United States,303 F. Supp. 1187 (S.D. Tex. 1969), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 439 F.2d 974 (5th Cir. 1971). a couple had lost their home to a fire, and had received compensation for their loss from the insurance company, partly in the form of hotel costs reimbursed. The U.S. District Court acknowledged the authority of the IRS to assess taxes on all forms of payment but did not permit taxation on the compensation provided by the insurance company, because unlike a wage or a sale of goods at a profit, this was not a gain. As the court noted, \\"Congress has taxed income, not compensation\\".Id. By contrast, at least two Federal courts of appeals have indicated that Congress may constitutionally tax an item as \\"income,\\" regardless of whether that item is in fact income. See Penn Mutual Indemnity Co. v. Commissioner277 F.2d 16, 60-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9389 (3d Cir. 1960). and Murphy v. Internal Revenue Serv.2007-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,531 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  Estate and gift tax  The origins of the estate and gift tax occurred during the rise of the state inheritance tax in the late 19th century and the progressive era. In the 1880s and 1890s, many states passed inheritance taxes, which taxed the donees on the receipt of their inheritance. While many objected to the application of an inheritance tax, some including Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller supported increases in the taxation of inheritance.Carnegie, The Gospel of Wealth, Harvard Press 1962, 14, 21-22. At the beginning of the 20th century, President Theodore Roosevelt advocated the application of a progressive inheritance tax on the federal level.Works of Theodore Roosevelt, Scribner's 1925, 17. In 1916, Congress adopted the present federal estate tax, which instead of taxing the wealth that a donee inherited as occurred in the state inheritance taxes it taxed the wealth of a donor's estate upon transfer. Later, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924, which imposed the gift tax, a tax on gifts given by the donor. In 1948 Congress allowed marital deductions for the estate and the gift tax. In 1981, Congress expanded this deduction to an unlimited amount for gifts between spouses.For the gift tax provision, see Internal Revenue Code sec. 2523(a), as amended by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, Pub. L. No. 97-34, sec. 403(b)(1), enacted August 13, 1981, effective for gifts made after December 31, 1981. Today, the estate tax is a tax imposed on the transfer of the \\"taxable estate\\" of a deceased person, whether such property is transferred via a will or according to the state laws of intestacy. The estate tax is one part of the Unified Gift and Estate Tax system in the United States. The other part of the system, the gift tax, imposes a tax on transfers of property during a person's life; the gift tax prevents avoidance of the estate tax should a person want to give away his/her estate just before dying. In addition to the federal government, many states also impose an estate tax, with the state version called either an estate tax or an inheritance tax. Since the 1990s, the term \\"death tax\\" has been widely used by those who want to eliminate the estate tax, because the terminology used in discussing a political issue affects popular opinion.60 Plus Association /// The Death Tax If an asset is left to a spouse or a charitable organization, the tax usually does not apply. The tax is imposed on other transfers of property made as an incident of the death of the owner, such as a transfer of property from an intestate estate or trust, or the payment of certain life insurance benefits or financial account sums to beneficiaries.  Payroll tax  Payroll tax history Taxes revenue by source chart history Prior to the Great Depression, the following economic problems were considered great hazards to working-class Americans: * The U.S. had no federal-government-mandated retirement savings; consequently, for many workers (those who could not afford both to save for retirement and to pay for living expenses), the end of their work careers was the end of all income. * Similarly, the U.S. had no federal-government- mandated disability income insurance to provide for citizens disabled by injuries (of any kind‚Äîwork-related or non-work-related); consequently, for most people, a disabling injury meant no more income if they had not saved enough money to prepare for such an event (since most people have little to no income except earned income from work). * In addition, there was no federal- government-mandated disability income insurance to provide for people unable to ever work during their lives, such as anyone born with severe mental retardation. * Finally, the U.S. had no federal-government-mandated health insurance for the elderly; consequently, for many workers (those who could not afford both to save for retirement and to pay for living expenses), the end of their work careers was the end of their ability to pay for medical care. = Creation = In the 1930s, the New Deal introduced Social Security to rectify the first three problems (retirement, injury-induced disability, or congenital disability). It introduced the FICA tax as the means to pay for Social Security. In the 1960s, Medicare was introduced to rectify the fourth problem (health care for the elderly). The FICA tax was increased in order to pay for this expense. = Development = President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the Social Security (FICA) Program. FICA began with voluntary participation, participants would have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program, the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year, the money the participants put into the independent \\"Trust Fund\\" rather than into the General operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program, and, the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income. During the Lyndon B. Johnson administration Social Security moved from the trust fund to the general fund. Participants may not have an income tax deduction for Social Security withholding. Immigrants became eligible for Social Security benefits during the Carter administration. During the Reagan administration Social Security annuities became taxable.  Alternative minimum tax  The alternative minimum tax (AMT) was introduced by the Tax Reform Act of 1969,Pub. L. No. 91-172, 83 Stat. 487 (December 30, 1969). and became operative in 1970. It was intended to target 155 high-income households that had been eligible for so many tax benefits that they owed little or no income tax under the tax code of the time. In recent years, the AMT has been under increased attention. With the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the AMT was broadened and refocused on home owners in high tax states. Because the AMT is not indexed to inflation and recent tax cuts,TPC Tax Topics Archive: The Individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT): 11 Key Facts and Projections an increasing number of middle-income taxpayers have been finding themselves subject to this tax. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report highlighted the AMT as the single most serious problem with the tax code. The advocate noted that the AMT punishes taxpayers for having children or living in a high-tax state and that the complexity of the AMT leads to most taxpayers who owe AMT not realizing it until preparing their returns or being notified by the IRS.  Capital gains tax  Federal Capital Gains Tax Collections 1954-2009 history chart The origins of the income tax on gains from capital assets did not distinguish capital gains from ordinary income. From 1913 to 1921, income from capital gains were taxed at ordinary rates, initially up to a maximum rate of 7 percent. Congress began to distinguish the taxation of capital gains from the taxation of ordinary income according to the holding period of the asset with the Revenue Act of 1921, allowed a tax rate of 12.5 percent gain for assets held at least two years. In addition to different tax rates depending on the holding period, Congress began excluding certain percentages of capital gains depending on the holding period. From 1934 to 1941, taxpayers could exclude percentages of gains that varied with the holding period: 20, 40, 60, and 70 percent of gains were excluded on assets held 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Beginning in 1942, taxpayers could exclude 50 percent of capital gains from income on assets held at least six months or elect a 25 percent alternative tax rate if their ordinary tax rate exceeded 50 percent. Capital gains tax rates were significantly increased in the 1969 and 1976 Tax Reform Acts. The 1970s and 1980s saw a period of oscillating capital gains tax rates. In 1978, Congress reduced capital gains tax rates by eliminating the minimum tax on excluded gains and increasing the exclusion to 60 percent, thereby reducing the maximum rate to 28 percent. The 1981 tax rate reductions further reduced capital gains rates to a maximum of 20 percent. Later in the 1980s, Congress began increasing the capital gains tax rate and repealing the exclusion of capital gains. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed the exclusion from income that provided for tax-exemption of long term capital gains, raising the maximum rate to 28 percent (33 percent for taxpayers subject to phaseouts). When the top ordinary tax rates were increased by the 1990 and 1993 budget acts, an alternative tax rate of 28 percent was provided. Effective tax rates exceeded 28 percent for many high- income taxpayers, however, because of interactions with other tax provisions. The end of the 1990s and the beginning of the present century heralded major reductions in taxing the income from gains on capital assets. Lower rates for 18-month and five-year assets were adopted in 1997 with the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, into law as part of a $1.35 trillion tax cut program.  Corporate tax  The United States' corporate tax rate was at its highest, 52.8 percent, in 1968 and 1969. The top rate was hiked last in 1993 to 35 percent. Under the \\"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\\" of 2017, the rate adjusted to 21 percent.

Daughter of the Bulgarian tsar Ivan Sratsimir, Dorothea was held hostage by King Louis I of Hungary, who married her off to Ban Tvrtko I of Bosnia in 1374. She became queen in 1377 and may have been the mother of King Tvrtko II.  Captivity  Dorothea was the daughter of Ivan Sratsimir, Tsar of Bulgaria. Her mother was Ivan Sratsimir's first cousin and second wife, Anna of Wallachia. Dorothea was captured along with her parents and sister in 1365 by the army of King Louis I of Hungary following his conquest of Ivan Sratsimir's capital city, Vidin. The family was held captive in Humnik Fortress in Bosiljevo, Croatia. spent four years in the fortress, and were forced to convert from Bulgarian Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism. Ivan Sratsimir was released and restored as Louis's vassal in 1369, but Louis retained Dorothea and her sister at the Hungarian court as honored hostages to ensure their father's loyalty. Dorothea was placed in care of the queen, Elizabeth of Bosnia, and queen mother, Elizabeth of Poland. According to Mavro Orbini, Dorothea was a lady-in-waiting to the Hungarian queen. While her sister died in childhood, Dorothea fell in favour of the King.  Marriage  Ban Tvrtko I of Bosnia, another vassal of King Louis, probably first heard about Dorothea during her captivity in Croatia. Louis eventually suggested that Tvrtko marry her. The negotiations were carried out by Louis on Dorothea's behalf. The marriage that made Dorothea Banness of Bosnia was celebrated in Hungarian-held Syrmia in early December 1374, either in ƒêakovo or in Ilinci; the wedding festivities doubtlessly took place in Ilinci. In October 1377, Tvrtko was crowned King of Bosnia and Dorothea became the country's first queen. As such, Dorothea was consulted in state affairs. She witnessed her husband's charters and took oaths to respect them, initially alongside her mother-in-law, Jelena ≈†ubiƒá. Queen Dorothea is mentioned in a 1382 charter to the Republic of Ragusa alongside the King and the King's son, presumably her son too. This child may have been the future King Tvrtko II. Queen Dorothea died shortly before 1390, when her husband was negotiating a remarriage into the House of Habsburg.

With her sister Gwendoline, she bequeathed a total of 260 works, particularly strong in Impressionist and 20th-century art, which formed the basis of the present-day National Museum Wales' international collection. The sisters started the Gregynog Press in 1922 and the Gregynog Music Festival in 1933. Early life and education Like her sister Gwen, Margaret was born at Llandinam and educated at Highfield School in Hendon. They and their brother David Davies, 1st Baron Davies, were the children of Edward Davies, the only son of David Davies Llandinam, an industrialist and philanthropist. Patron of the arts An amateur painter, Margaret shared Gwen's passion for collecting works by the Impressionists and other contemporary artists. She started the collection in 1906 with her purchase of a painting by Hercules Brabazon Brabazon. By 1913, the two sisters had accumulated enough paintings to host an exhibition at Cardiff City Hall. During the First World War, the Davies sisters worked as volunteers for the French Red Cross, as they had already travelled extensively in France. They offered asylum in Wales during the war to the Belgian artists George Minne, Valerius de Saedeleer and Gustave van de Woestyne. In the early 1920s, they moved into Gregynog Hall at Newtown, Montgomeryshire. In 1922, they founded the Gregynog Press, publishing fine limited editions of works in English and Welsh. From 1933 to 1938, they sponsored the Gregynog Music Festival at their estate, an annual 3‚Äì4 day affair directed by Henry Walford Davies that included poetry readings. The festivals played host to important composers and other musical figures of the period, including Ralph Vaughan Williams, Edward Elgar, Gustav Holst, \\"the conductor Adrian Boult, and the poet Lascelles Abercrombie; and performers including Jelly d'Ar√°nyi and the Rothschild Quartet.\\"Rhagor: \\"Gregynog: Arts and Music for Wales\\" , National Museum Wales, accessed 13 Oct 2010 The festival ended during the build-up to the Second World War. It was revived during 1955‚Äì1961 by the composer Ian Parrott, Gregynog Professor of Music at Aberystwyth for more than 30 years. The festival was revived again in 1988 by the tenor Anthony Rolfe Johnson. Since 2006, it has been directed by the music historian and broadcaster, Rhian Davies. In 1960, some years after her sister's death in 1951, Margaret Davies donated Gregynog to the University of Wales for use as an arts centre. Margaret died in London, and her ashes were buried along with her sister's at their birthplace of Llandinam. They bequeathed their collection of paintings and sculptures, which Margaret had expanded after Gwen's death, to the National Museum of Wales. The total of 260 works of painting and sculpture formed the nucleus of its art collection, particularly for international art. It has been called \\"one of the great British art collections of the 20th century\\".Art: \\"Davies Sisters Collection\\" , National Museum Wales, accessed 13 Oct 2010 Among these were seven oil paintings that had been bought as Turners (including The Beacon Light).Wales Online Three of these were subsequently judged to be fake and withdrawn from display. These works were re-examined by the BBC TV programme, Fake or Fortune where they were reinstated as genuine Turners. All seven paintings will now be exhibited together. In 1967, The Davies Memorial Gallery was built in Newtown, Powys, with a legacy left by the Davies sisters. More recently, in 2003, after major redevelopment and merging with \\"Oriel 31\\", the Gallery re-opened as Oriel Davies Gallery, named in honour of the sisters.

The figure illustrates that countries with higher levels of socio-economic development tend to have proportionally less of their economies operating in the primary and secondary sectors and more emphasis on the tertiary sector. The less developed countries exhibit the inverse pattern. Three sectors according to Fourasti√© Clark's sector model One classical breakdown of economic activity distinguishes three sectors: * Primary: involves the retrieval and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron. (A coal miner, farmer or fisherman would be workers in the primary sector.) * Secondary: involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. (A builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary sector.) * Tertiary: involves the supplying of services to consumers and businesses, such as baby-sitting, cinema and banking. (A shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary sector.) In the 20th century, economists began to suggest that traditional tertiary services could be further distinguished from \\"quaternary\\" and quinary service sectors. Economic activity in the hypothetical quaternary sector comprises information- and knowledge-based services, while quinary services include industry related to human services and hospitality.  Historic evolution  An economy may include several sectors (also called \\"industries\\") that evolved in successive phases: * The ancient economy built mainly on the basis of subsistence farming. * The industrial revolution lessened the role of subsistence farming, converting land-use to more extensive and monocultural forms of agriculture over the last three centuries. Economic growth took place mostly in the mining, construction and manufacturing industries. * In the economies of modern consumer societies, services, finance, and technology ‚Äì the knowledge economy ‚Äì play an increasingly significant role. Even in modern times, developing countries tend to rely more on the first two sectors, in contrast to developed countries.

It is within Salisbury Plain. The village is on the right (west) bank of the Avon, opposite Fittleton. The parish extends west onto Netheravon Down.  History  A Roman villa stood near the Avon, on a site now south of Netheravon House. Domesday Book recorded three landholdings with a total of 132 households. The Dukes of Beaufort had a large sporting estate at Netheravon in the early 18th century, which continued to be managed by their successors, the Hicks Beach family, until the end of the 19th century. The ancient parish included West Chisenbury, a detached tithing and hamlet to the north. This area was transferred to Enford parish in 1885. Much land in the area was bought by the War Department in 1898, including Netheravon House and almost the whole of Netheravon Parish, sold by Michael Hicks Beach. Gun ranges were established on the downs after the arrival of the army's machine gun school in 1922. A one- room school was built on the east side of the High Street c. 1846 and later became a National School. In 1871 49 pupils were recorded, rising to 90 in 1911 and 119 in 1926, in part due to the presence of the Flying Training School. In 1964 the school was amalgamated with that at Fittleton, with infants attending Netheravon and older children going to Fittleton. In the 1980s the school at Fittleton was closed and Netheravon became a primary school, on a new site towards the southern end of the High Street. =Netheravon House= The dovecote at Netheravon House Netheravon house was built after 1734 as a hunting box for Henry Scudamore, Duke of Beaufort, possibly on the site of an earlier manor house. The grounds were laid out before 1755 by Thomas Wright. In 1791 a block was added in the centre of the north front, for Michael Hicks Beach to designs of John Soane. The three- storey house is built in brick and has five bays to its south entrance front, where there is a pedimented porch. An 18th-century dovecote stands in the grounds to the north of the house. The large stable block of 1734‚Äì40 is also in brick, and surrounds four sides of a courtyard with a narrow opening to the north. A colonnade links the house and stables. Following purchase by the War Department in 1898, the house and stables were the home of the Cavalry School from 1904. In 1975 the house served as the Officers' Mess for the Support Weapons Wing of the School of Infantry. In the 1990s the house, stables and grounds were sold by the Ministry of Defence. In 2004 the house was converted into two homes and the stables into seven. Avon Camp continues to occupy a site to the south. In 1986 the house was recorded as Grade II* listed, and the stables and dovecote Grade II.  Parish church  All Saints Church A church was recorded in the Domesday survey of 1086. The church of All Saints, built of rendered flint, has a tall west tower, its lower parts surviving from the 11th century. The nave and chancel were built in the 13th century, and the aisles rebuilt in the 15th. Restoration in the 19th century, some by C.E. Ponting, included replacement of the roofs and chancel arch, and demolition of the north porch. The peal of bells in the tower was increased from five to six in 1911, and two were recast at the same time. Of the others, one is dated 1585 and another 1695. The church was recorded as Grade I listed in 1964. From the early 12th century until 1846, the church was a prebend of Salisbury Cathedral. The benefice was united with Fittleton in 1953 and with Enford in 1973 but the parishes remained distinct. Today the church is part of the Avon River team ministry, which covers six parishes. Military camps =Cavalry School= Military activity was first established at Netheravon in 1904 with the creation of a cavalry school under the sponsorship of Major General Robert Baden-Powell as the Inspector General of Cavalry. Baden-Powell envisioned developments in the use of Cavalry following his experiences in Southern Africa and India, and lessons from the Second Boer War. The school emphasised the use of cavalry for scouting and reconnaissance, recognising that the traditional effects of mass of cavalry had been diminished by the availability of modern weapons. The Officers' Mess was established at Netheravon House. =Aviation operations and training= Netheravon Airfield is outside the parish, on the other bank of the Avon in Fittleton and Figheldean parishes. A grass strip airfield was created for the Royal Flying Corps northeast of Coulston Camp (later called Airfield Camp) in 1913 and later became RAF Netheravon, an operational and training base. It was the home of No. 1 Flying Training School RAF from 1919 until 1931, and during the Second World War was used again for training and as a short-term base for operational squadrons, with glider and parachute activity from 1941. In 1963 the airfield and camp were transferred to the Army, and became AAC Netheravon (Army Air Corps) from 1966 until 2012. =Avon Camp= With the establishment of the airfield in 1912, the Cavalry School continued to operate in the remaining training areas until the beginning of the war, re-opening briefly in 1919. In 1922 the school amalgamated with the Royal Artillery Riding Establishment in Northamptonshire and the site was taken over by the Machine Gun School, following a move from Grantham. The Machine Gun School was absorbed as an element of the Small Arms School Corps in 1926. Over time the school expanded to encompass support weapons in general, becoming the Support Weapons Wing of SASC. Courses at Avon Camp included the use of: *Mortar *Heavy Machine Gun *General Purpose Machine Gun ‚Äì Sustained Fire *Man Portable Anti-Tank *Surveillance Support Weapons Wing remained at Netheravon until 1995 when Avon Camp was closed and the Wing moved to the Land Warfare Centre, Warminster. The part of the site known as Avon Camp West, on the A345 south of Netheravon, was proposed for the building of a new Royal Artillery Museum after the Firepower museum at Woolwich closed in 2016. However, the offer of a lease of the site was withdrawn in 2020. Governance The village is the most populous part of 'The Collingbournes and Netheravon' electoral ward. This ward starts in the west at Netheravon, stretches east to Collingbourne Ducis and ends in the east at Chute Forest. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,186.  In media  Channel 4 television programme Time Team briefly re-investigated the Roman villa site for a Series 4 episode, first broadcast in 1997. Notable people Sydney Smith (1771‚Äì1845), later known as a humourist and writer, was a curate at Netheravon in the late 1790s and established a Sunday school. He left the parish after he was appointed travelling tutor to the son of Michael Hicks Beach. The writer Frank Sawyer (1906‚Äì1980), born nearby in Bulford, lived in Netheravon while employed as a river keeper on the Avon and died on the banks of the river near the parish church. He developed the Pheasant Tail Nymph for fly fishing and wrote the books Keeper of the Stream and Nymphs and the Trout. Oliver Kite (1920‚Äì1968) was an equally well known fly fisherman who, from 1958 until his death on the River Test from a heart attack, lived on the High Street as a near neighbour of Sawyer.

The song was specially written for Hijazi by the famed Ramy Youssef. The song was somewhat a mixture of Khaleeji dialects and music with Western beats, which made it famous among audience. It was sung in the Khaleeji accent and is considered to be one of her greatest success since the release of her album Zaman. \\"Nefsy Tefhimny\\" was a hit throughout the Middle East topping charts from Lebanon to Syria to the Persian Gulf region. Fans consider it to be Hijazi's greatest hit ever since \\"Zaman\\" and \\"Romancia\\". One of the most broadcast songs of 2007, the single also spawned an equally popular music video. The video of the song gained immense popularity, being directed by the famed Tony Kahwaji. Hijazi appeared with yet another different look, wearing an extremely short skirt, a white blouse and black coat and gloves, a style similar to an air hostess. Fans also noted that Hijazi had never looked so seductive in any of her previous music videos, not even in \\"Baya al Ward\\" or \\"Einak\\" her duet with Faudel. \\"Nefsy Tefhimny\\" topped charts all around the Middle East. It debuted at #2 on the official Pepsi Top 10 charts on Rotana but later moved on to #1, ahead of the musical giant Latifa. Hijazi's new single brought her immense fame, especially in Arab states of the Persian Gulf, where she was admired because of her vocal abilities to sing in so many diverse accents. Previously, Hijazi had sung in both Lebanese and Egyptian dialects and even done a famous, French-dialect song on her second album Zaman. In addition, the music video for the song received massive airplay on the Rotana music channels.

Early life Humphrey was born in New Baltimore, Ohio to Lyman and Elizabeth (Everhart) Humphrey, one of two sons born to the couple. His father was born in Connecticut, but relocated to Deerfield, Ohio, where he purchased a tannery formerly owned by Jesse Grant (father of Ulysses S. Grant). Humphrey's father gave up the tannery business after several years and began to practice law. His father died in 1853 and through the influence of his mother, Humphrey received a common school education first in New Baltimore and then high school in Massillon, Ohio. He left school in 1861 to join the 76th Ohio Infantry. He later received his J.D. from the University of Michigan in 1867. Civil War The 76th Ohio was part of the Army of the Tennessee. Humphrey rose quickly through the ranks and was promoted to first lieutenant. He participated in twenty-seven battles and skirmishes including Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Corinth, the siege of Vicksburg, Resaca, and Atlanta. The regiment participated in the march to the sea and through the Carolinas to the battle of Bentonville. At Ringgold Gap on November 27, 1863, Humphrey was wounded but missed no duty due to the wound. He was mustered out with the regiment at Louisville, Kentucky on July 19, 1865. Personal life Humphrey married Amanda Leonard on December 25, 1872, in Beardstown, Illinois. They had two sons. Professional career Following the Civil War, Humphrey attended Mount Union College for one year followed by a year in the law department of the University of Michigan. Short on funds, Humphrey left school, but was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1868. He moved to Shelby County, Missouri where he became a teacher and newspaper editor of the Shelby County Herald. Humphrey was admitted to the Missouri bar in 1870. The following year, Humphrey moved to Independence, Kansas where he practiced law and started the South Kansas Tribune newspaper. He gave up the newspaper a year later and settled into the practice of law full-time, until December 1872 when he helped found the Commercial Bank of Independence. Humphrey became the bank's president and helped reorganize the bank in 1891 as the Commercial National Bank. He continued with the bank until he was elected governor. Politics Humphrey was a devoted Republican and was active in party politics in every state in which he lived. In 1872 he unsuccessfully ran for the Kansas House of Representatives because he opposed the issue of railroad bonds. Four years later he was overwhelmingly elected to represent Montgomery County in the Kansas House of Representatives. Before his term expired, Humphrey was appointed the ninth lieutenant governor to fill the vacancy left by Melville J. Salter. During the regular election of 1878, he was elected to the same position by a margin of 40,000 votes. Humphrey completed his term as lieutenant governor and was elected to the Kansas Senate in 1884. Governor of Kansas Humphrey ran for governor in 1888 and won the position by the largest plurality to that time in Kansas; he won the majority vote in all but two counties. He defeated his Republican predecessor John A. Martin, who was tremendously popular. Humphrey was reelected to a second term in 1890. Later life Following his term as governor, Humphrey returned to the practice of law. In 1892, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives. Humphrey died at Independence on September 12, 1915 and is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery. See also * List of Governors of Kansas Footnotes References *Connelley, William E.

During his political career, Gripenstedt was a member of the Swedish Estates Assembly (as a representative of the nobility) from 1840 to 1848, Minister without Portfolio from 1848 to 1856, Minister for Finance from 1856 to 1866, and Member of Parliament from 1867 to 1873. He is best known for his ten years tenure as Minister for Finance, during which he introduced many liberal economic reforms and fought for issues such as free trade and state owned railways.  Early life and military career  Johan August Gripenstedt was born in the Duchy of Holstein, then part of the German Confederation, where his parents lived at the time. His father Jakob Gripenstedt was a retired Swedish officer. His mother Helena Kristina (n√©e Weinschenck) was the daughter of a German physician. The Gripenstedt family's earliest descendant was a man named Hieronimus Berger, born in the Courland region of modern-day Latvia, who immigrated to Sweden and was ennobled with name Gripenstedt in 1691. Johan August Gripenstedt came to Sweden with his family at the age of four. He grew up at the estate of Gr√§fsn√§s in V√§sterg√∂tland and later, when the estate's fee tail ended following his uncle's death in 1821, at the nearby estate of Holm√§ngen. Gripenstedt and his brothers were educated at home, and following his examination in the spring of 1827 he was registered at Uppsala University. However, Gripenstedt's plans for a civilian career promptly changed and in 1828 he left the university for the Royal War Academy in Stockholm. After completing his education at the Royal War Academy, Gripenstedt became a Second Lieutenant at the G√∂ta Artillery Regiment in Gothenburg, in 1831. Following further education at the Marieberg Upper Military School from 1832 to 1835, Gripenstedt was in 1837 promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and, in 1841, to the rank of Artillery Staff Officer. At this time however, Gripenstedt had already started a new career as a politician. In 1846 he was at his own request released from military service.  Politics and entrepreneurship  Gripenstedt first entered politics as a representative of the nobility at the Riksdag of 1840‚Äì1841. He soon distinguished himself as a skillful speaker and was elected to the parliament's Committee on the Accords (). Through his marriage into the Anckarsw√§rd family in 1842, Gripenstedt became affiliated with the \\"liberal landowners'\\"-faction of the parliament, led by Carl Henrik Anckarsw√§rd. In the end of 1841, Gripenstedt was elected to the parliament's powerful Committee on the Constitution, which at this time worked on a new representative reform. As opposed to the conservative group of the parliament, Gripenstedt was a strong adherent of free elections and general suffrage long before this was realized in Sweden. During start of the Riksdag of 1847, Gripenstedt was elected to the Committee of the State. As a trustee of Carl Henrik Anckarsw√§rd, and later as the owner of estates such as Nyn√§s Castle in S√∂dermanland, Gripenstedt became a successful entrepreneur within the grain exports and iron industry. In 1848 Gripenstedt was selected, to many's surprise, by King Oscar I to serve as Minister without Portfolio () in his cabinet. The post was first offered to the conservative Jacob Nils Tersmeden, who declined, and King Oscar wanted to rejuvenate his cabinet why he selected Gripenstedt instead. Gripenstedt also served as acting Minister for Finance from 10 January to 21 October 1851. On 28 May 1856 he was appointed as (permanent) Minister for Finance. Influenced by French liberal thinkers such as Alexis de Tocqueville and Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat, Gripenstedt was a leading proponent of free trade and other liberal reforms. He succeeded in getting the Swedish parliament to gradually abolish tariffs and reduce customs duties. In 1865 he signed trade agreements with France, the German Customs Union and Prussia, which resulted in greatly reduced customs duties on many products. His optimistic descriptions in the Swedish parliament in 1857 of the economic situation of the country, the so-called \\"flower paintings\\" (), paved the way for a fast expansion of the Swedish railroad network, which was financed by loans on the international market. Gripenstedt opposed an activist foreign policy, which he saw as a threat to the economic stability of the country. As the Danish-German conflict over the Schleswig- Holstein Question grew more tense, Gripenstedt and then Prime Minister for Justice Louis De Geer (also a devoted liberal) stopped King Charles' plan for Swedish military support in the upcoming war. Johan August Gripenstedt Following his retirement as Minister for Finance on 4 July 1866, Gripenstedt served as a member of the lower house of the new bicameral parliament from 1867 to 1873. He died in Stockholm on 13 July 1874 (aged sixty), following a long period of illness. He is buried at B√§linge Church in S√∂dermanland.  Family life  Gripenstedt married his wife Eva Anckarsw√§rd, the oldest daughter of Colonel August Anckarsw√§rd and Sofia Ulrika Anckarsw√§rd (n√©e Bonde), in 1842. Together with his wife he had five children.  Titles and honours  Gripenstedt was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences () in 1858. He was ennobled by King Charles as a baron () on 4 May 1860.  Legacy  Gripenstedt is widely seen as one of the most decisive and influential persons in Swedish political history. As a great speaker and with a good sense of political intrigues and tactics, Gripenstedt was successful in almost everything that he took on. He is not only credited as the one who initiated and guided Sweden's transition to a capitalist economy, but also as one of the main architects of the \\"liberal revolution\\" of the 1800s. His reforms changed Sweden definitely into a new direction of liberalized economy and free trade. These new policies ultimately paved the way for the Swedish industrialization. The period from 1870 to 1970 is commonly referred to in Swedish history as the \\"Hundred Years of Growth\\". During this period Sweden developed from one of the poorest countries in Europe to one of the richest and most prosperous countries in the world. In the book Historiens 100 viktigaste svenskar (\\"100 Most Important Swedes in History\\"), written by Niklas Ekdal and Petter Karlsson, Gripenstedt was ranked as the twelfth most important Swede in history.

It is somewhat of a biogeographical anomaly, being the only species in the genus Lewinia to have reached the islands of New Zealand, skipping over the main islands to reach the remote Auckland group. Its closest relative is Lewin's rail of Australia. The species is currently restricted to two islands in the Auckland group, Adams Island and Disappointment Island. The Auckland rail is a small rail with chestnut back plumage and a grey breast. The flanks are barred black and white and the head is red-brown, with a red bill. It is smaller than the Australian Lewins' rail. There are conflicting reports about its ability to fly. Early accounts suggested it could; recent researchers have found little evidence for this. If the species is able to fly, it does so very infrequently. Auckland rails have a variety of calls, the most common being a crex call made at one second intervals 10 or more times in a row. The function of the calls is unknown. Little is known about the reproductive biology of the Auckland rail. The few nests that have been found contained clutches of two eggs, probably laid in early November. The eggs are cream coloured with red, brown and grey spots. The Auckland rail is highly secretive and was considered to be extinct for many years before its rediscovery. The population is currently stable on the two islands it survives on. It is thought to have become extinct on the main Auckland Islands due to the presence of introduced feral cats and pigs; it is hoped the eventual removal of these from the islands will allow for reintroductions to other islands in the group. The species is currently considered vulnerable by the IUCN and BirdLife International due to the possibility of rats or other predators reaching the two islands it survives on.

So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name Unswerving. Career Unswerving carried out work-ups at end of 1943, then joined the 1st Flotilla in the Mediterranean, where she carried out patrols in the Aegean Sea. She would eventually spend most of her wartime career in the Mediterranean, where she sank the German guardboats GN 61 and GN 62, the German tanker Bertha (the former French Bacchus) and six sailing vessels, and claimed to have damaged a seventh. She was however unlucky on numerous occasions, unsuccessfully attacking the small German merchant Toni (the former Greek Thalia), the German auxiliary minelayer Zeus, the German transport Pelikan and her escort, the German torpedo boat TA19, and the German merchant Gertrud on two separate occasions. Under the command of Lieutenant M.

Usually taken in the afternoon or for brunch, it fills in the meal gap between the noontime meal and the evening meal, being the equivalent of afternoon tea in the English-speaking world; or between breakfast and lunch. It is a simple meal that often consists of a piece of fruit, cookies, yogurt, and other snacks paired with juice, hot chocolate, coffee, spirits, or other beverages. It is typical for Argentines and Uruguayans to have once or merienda around 5pm, between the midday meal and supper. It generally consists of an infusion (tea, mate, coffee, mate cocido, etc.) and a baked snack (scones, bread, toasts, cake, facturas, etc.), usually accompanied with dulce de leche, honey, butter or jam. In the Philippines, merienda (Filipino: meryenda or minand√°l) is a generic term encompassing two light meals: the first is a morning snack that may correspond to either brunch, elevenses, or second breakfast; the second one is the equivalent of afternoon tea. Merienda taken in the early evening around sunset just before or in place of dinner is meanwhile distinctly referred to as merienda cena. Broadly, merienda is any sort of dish or snack in a portion smaller than the traditional \\"full meal\\" consisting of rice and a complementary viand (unless the merienda is taken as brunch or merienda cena), coupled with either a cool or hot drink (usually coffee). Common fare may be sweet or savoury, ranging from breads and pastries (notably pandesal), desserts and sweets, street food, to noodle dishes. In coastal parts of Croatia, Slovenia, and on the Greek island of Corfu, it is referred to marenda, a meal eaten between breakfast and lunch. Usually it is a light snack, like sandwiches or toast, eaten during a work break. Go√ªter In France, the merienda is called go√ªter or quatre- heures; the latter name refers to its timing at around 4PM. The modern go√ªter is lighter than a full meal, and is more often observed by children than by adults. It was a full cold meal until the 18th century, before which the go√ªter was taken at around 5PM, but began to fade in popularity thereafter, since the evening meal was pushed up to around 6PM. Podwieczorek In Poland, the merienda is called podwieczorek or ju≈ºyna. It's a meal eaten in the late afternoon, \\"in the evening\\". Fills the break between lunch and dinner. Typically, light snacks are eaten, such as ice cream, fruit, cookies, chips, and fruit juice or hot drinks. Afternoon tea is eaten between 14.30 and 18.00. Podwieczorek in everyday life is eaten rather sporadically, and if it does not deviate from the second breakfast, consisting of bread with butter and jam and tea. On Sundays and holidays, however, afternoon tea is something common, providing an opportunity to socialize with sweet, mostly yeast bread, which is sipped with coffee or tea. In the Wielkopolska cuisine, a certain peculiarity is a potato pancake, known as a bambrzak, once consumed for an afternoon snack.

Promotion and relegation are in place throughout the system. Women's Rugby union in England consists of 26 leagues, which includes a national semi- professional league at the highest level, down to amateur regional leagues. Promotion and relegation are in place throughout the system, with the exception of the Women's Premiership. History Historically, there were no leagues allowed as these were seen as a sign of professionalism. In the 1970s the RFU allowed the creation of regional merit leagues with the most significant ones being the North, Midlands, South West and London merit leagues. In 1984 the RFU approved the creation of two national merit tables where clubs had to play a minimum of eight games against the clubs in their division. 1985 saw the creation of a third national merit league. In 1987 this was formed into a true national league system. =Recent restructures= The format and competitiveness of the leagues has changed greatly since the leagues were first formed and the latest widespread and global restructuring of the leagues was announced in November 2008, for implementation from the 2009‚Äì10 season. Under this new structure, the top league remains the 12-team Aviva Premiership. The second tier league has been rebranded and restructured; as the RFU Championship which has replaced the old National Division One. This league also has 12 teams, and like the Premiership, is professional. Beneath the two professional leagues, the National Leagues have been restructured to include a new 16 team National League 1, 16 team National League 2 South and 16 team National League 2 North. The four top regional leagues are now part of National League 3 at level five. For the 2017-18 season, the National League 3 leagues have been renamed to have Premier as part of their title in order to make a distinction between regional rugby union and the National Leagues above. Other changes that season would see London 3 North East be replaced by two new leagues - London 3 Eastern Counties and London 3 Essex - with teams transferred depending on location. Level 1: Premiership Rugby  Premiership Rugby is the top level league in England, containing the best 12 professional clubs. The premiership still includes strict ground criteria and a salary cap that must be met by all participants. Promotion and relegation remains between the top two divisions with the bottom side being relegated at the end of the season, providing the promoted club meets the ground criteria. The promoted club will no longer be the top team in the RFU Championship after the 22 match first phase; the champions being decided by a play-off system which is hoped to bring to an end a select number of clubs bouncing between the leagues. (For example, each season between 2005‚Äì06 and 2008‚Äì09 saw the club relegated to National Division One earning promotion to the Premiership the following season, and also either the promotion or relegation of Leeds Carnegie.) Debate still continues over the question of promotion and relegation, but with the strict criteria and now a fully professional Championship providing the replacement financial fears are reduced. Level 2: RFU Championship The new RFU Championship was formed in 2009‚Äì10 to provide a second tier of professional competition. The former National Division One was decreased from 16 clubs to 12 to accommodate the new fixture structure. For the first three seasons this included: * a first phase of 22 regular season games * for the top eight teams, a second group phase, with the teams split into two groups; the top two teams in each group advanced to promotion play-offs, with the winner earning promotion provided they met Premiership entry standards * for the bottom four teams, a separate group phase, without a play-off, to determine the relegation place * participation in a new British and Irish Cup with Irish, Scottish and Welsh clubs * a minimum of 32 games per season Starting with the 2012‚Äì13 season, the second group stage was discontinued. The top four teams at the end of the home-and-away season entered play-offs to determine the league champion, which earned promotion providing Premiership entry standards were met. The bottom team at the end of home-and-away season was relegated to, and replaced by the champions of, the third tier National Division One. From 2017‚Äì18 through to at least 2019‚Äì20, the championship play- off has been eliminated. The regular-season champions now earn automatic promotion (again, assuming that they meet Premiership standards). Relegation criteria did not change. Levels 3-5: National Leagues The new National League structure includes: =Level 3: National League 1= The former National Division Two was renamed and increased from 14 to 16 teams.

The two league champions are promoted, with the two runners-up meeting in a promotion play-off to decide the third promoted team. The bottom three in each league are relegated to their respective regional division. A new element is that the champions will meet in a National Final. =Level 5: National League 3= The former top regional leagues became the lowest level of the national league structure, increasing in size from 12 to 14 teams. The leagues are: *North Premier *Midlands Premier *London & South East Premier *South West Premier The four champions are promoted to either the National League 2 North or National League 2 South, the four runners up enter play-offs to decide the other two promoted sides. The four champions clubs also meet in a knock-out national finals competition. Regional leagues With the restructuring, levels 6‚Äì12 became the new regional system. There are now 8 regional Division 1 leagues, which are connected to the national leagues by promotion and relegation. The system The table below shows the current structure of the system. For each division, its official name, sponsorship name (which differs from its historic name) and number of clubs is given. At levels 1‚Äì3, each division promotes to the national division(s) that lie directly above it and relegates to the national division(s) that lie directly below it. Below that level, clubs relegate to the nearest local league. https://www.englandrugby.com/fixtures-and- results/browse-competitions See also * Rugby union in England References External links * http://www.scrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/86076.html (Explains new structure) *https://www.englandrugby.com/news/article/final-league-positions-for- community-game-confirmed-qazxsw (shows Level 2-5 Women's structure) ","title":"English rugby union system"},{"id":"12255298","text":"Sugunia was a city mentioned by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III.The Origins of the Urartians in the Light of the Van/Karag√ºnd√ºz Excavations, by Veli Sevin, p.159 The Monolith Inscription of Salmaneser II: References Category:Urartian cities Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:Archaeological sites in Eastern Anatolia ","title":"Sugunia"},{"id":"12255319","text":"Faisal Khalil Sebait Mubarak Al-Junaibi (; born 4 December 1982 in Sharjah, UAE) is an Emirati footballer who plays .

His short articles were marked by his trademark crude humor, as well as his attempts to present a \\"truthful\\" or objective viewpoint of various events in his life and his own subjective responses to those events. The series is currently published by City Lights Publishing Company but can also be found in Portions from a Wine- Stained Notebook, which is a collection of all of Bukowski's wide ranging works. Plot summary Bukowski uses his own life as the basis for his series of articles, and characteristically leaves nothing out. The different stories range from hooking up with the wife of a stranger who invites him over for dinner to admire his work, to Bukowski's versions of \\"debates\\" with other writers at \\"Open City\\". Bukowski goes through life and each event without caring about the consequences of his actions. He is almost always alone aside from the occasional prostitute that he invites over. A few times, generous people who admire his writings will allow him to stay with them rent free, though he does not understand why people enjoy his writings so much. As soon as he starts to get too close to these families or hosts he will leave without notice and go on to find a new place to stay. However, he does mention that he does not want readers to feel sorry for him, which is why he includes crude comedy along with each story. He always has some type of alcohol with him that allows him to be as carefree as he is. Whether he is drinking while writing his stories and poetry, or showing up to work and meetings already drunk, every story incorporates his vigorous drinking habits. A Dirty Old Man Confesses Along with the series Notes of a Dirty Old Man, Portions From a Wine-Stained Notebook includes another deep look into Charles Bukowski's life. It is a lengthened version of Notes of a Dirty Old Man that is more of an autobiography about him becoming a writer than a short story. It is called A Dirty Old Man Confesses. In this short autobiography, Notes of a Dirty Old Man is put more into perspective on when it is occurring in Bukowski's life. It is a more personal and serious way for readers and fans to get to know more about the author and how he lived. It begins during his early childhood by explaining the difficult relationship that he had with his father. His father whipped him for the slightest reasons whenever he got the chance. Bukowski became numb from the pain and began isolating himself from everyone around him, even other children at school. Eventually he was able to move out on his own and began entering drinking and gambling contests because he found he was very good at it. He began his cycle of getting kicked out and moving into different homes and hotels (which is elaborated more on in Notes of a Dirty Old Man). His life would go downhill fast until his writing career became slightly successful and then go downhill again; his article was published in Story and other magazines, the underground newspaper published his stories, and then eventually by Essex House. In between each success he would work unfulfilling jobs, drink more than usual, and take advantage of the generosity of anyone who would let him.  Quotes  * \\"Can't they see through my skin, can't they see that I am nothing?\\" * \\"I became another drunk, thinking of suicide, sitting in little rooms for days with all the shades down, wondering what was out there and what was wrong with it- not knowing whether to blame it on my father or myself or them.\\" * \\"The people walk with such an indifference I begin to hate them, but then again I've never really been fond of anything.\\" * \\"They will kill him because he has not died at all. I have died nine-tenths but keep the other one-tenth like a gun.\\" Alcoholism =In the novel= Alcoholism is very prevalent in both of Bukowski's Dirty Old Man pieces. He displays many of the outcomes that most people with alcoholism show as well: self-control problems, difficulty in identifying feelings, apathy toward external reality, difficulty in emotional processing, and more depressed and/or anxious, and a face deformed by its abuses. However, his alcoholism is not an issue that Bukowski wishes to change; it is simply a way of life for him.

History De-Lite Records was founded in 1967 by Fred Vigorito, Fred Fioto and Ted Simonetti. Prominent on their staff was veteran music producer Gene Redd. The very first album released on De-Lite was in 1968: catalog number DE-2001, \\"The New Sounds Of The Louis Prima Show\\", featuring Louis Prima, Sam Butera And The Witnesses, Gia Maione, and Little Richie Varola. De-Lite's first single was by an unknown singer named \\"Mr. Ginger Ale\\" in 1968, \\"That Old Feeling\\"/\\"Love Walked In\\", catalog number 509. One of the label's first signings for popular music was Kool and the Gang, who originally appeared on a precursor label, Red Coach. Their eponymous instrumental single was their first big R&B; hit, in the year 1969 (\\"Kool & The Gang\\"/\\"Raw Hamburger\\", Red Coach R 601; later released as De-Lite 519-0). Kool and the Gang was the most successful act for De-Lite, scoring many hits on the R&B; and pop charts. In the 1970s, Pickwick International took over distribution of the label, and Kool and The Gang's pop success began in 1973 with their first Top 40 crossover hit, \\"Funky Stuff.\\" Disco pioneers Crown Heights Affair were signed to the label in 1975, and promptly released \\"Dreaming a Dream\\", which reached #5 on Billboard's R&B; Singles chart. They followed with the Top 20 hits, \\"Every Beat of My Heart,\\" \\"Foxy Lady\\", and \\"Dancin'.\\" The album \\"Dreaming a Dream\\" was followed by \\"Do It Your Way\\" (1976), \\"Dream World\\" (1978), \\"Dance Lady Dance\\" (1979), and \\"Sure Shot\\" (1980). After PolyGram purchased Pickwick in 1977 it took over distribution of the De-Lite label, which maintained the imprint for Kool And The Gang's releases. In 1985, De-Lite was absorbed into PolyGram sublabel Mercury Records, and Kool and the Gang were transferred there as well. In 1998, Polygram merged with Universal Music Group; their subsidiary Island Records now manages the De-Lite catalog. Other De-Lite Imprints De-Lite had other imprints as well: *Gang Records - A boutique label run by Kool and The Gang. Its only two artists were Kool and The Gang's prot√©g√© group The Kay Gees, who would later switch to the parent De-Lite label, and Tomorrow's Edition (who put out only two singles, \\"Be Real\\" and \\"Say It Again\\"). *Vigor Records - A sublabel named after De-Lite co-founder Fred Vigorito, which is notable for the album Soul On Your Side by The Rhythm Makers, an early incarnation of the disco group GQ. GQ is best known for their hit \\"Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)\\". *Red Coach Records - A label founded by Gene Redd; at one time it was distributed by Chess Records, but then it switched distribution to De-Lite. One notable artist was Everyday People, who was the only artist to release an album for the label. In fact, Red Coach was Kool and The Gang's original label, from which their first single was released.

The accreditation is done by professionals who are qualified to determine air ambulance safety. In addition, compliance with accreditation standards is done on a continual basis by the accrediting organization. Their accreditation standards are periodically revised to reflect the dynamic, changing environment of medical transport with considerable input from all disciplines of the medical profession.\\" Other states require either CAMTS accreditation or a demonstrated equivalent, such as Rhode Island and Texas, which has adopted CAMTS' Accreditation Standards (Sixth Edition, October 2004) as its own. In Texas and Maryland, an operator not wishing to become CAMTS accredited must submit to an equivalent survey by state auditors who are CAMTS-trained.

The hospital was built between 1492 and 1504 and was destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, along with most of the city. Foundation In 1492, after obtaining papal approval, King John II ordered the building of one of the most important civil and charitative infrastructures in old Lisbon, the Hospital Real de Todos-os-Santos. The Hospital was finished in 1504, during the reign of King Manuel I. The construction of the Hospital was part of a Royal campaign to centralise the health assistance of the most important cities of the Kingdom into general hospitals. Large hospitals were also founded in Coimbra (1508), √âvora (1515) and Braga (1520). Location and architecture The main fa√ßade of All-Saints Hospital occupied the whole eastern side of Rossio Square. Today's Pra√ßa da Figueira (Fig Tree Square) is located over of the area occupied by the old Hospital. Old descriptions and excavations indicate that the building had a ground floor and two upper stories and was organised into several square- shaped wings with central courtyards around the Hospital Chapel. The Chapel was located in middle of the ensemble and had a massive tower in the eastern end of the nave. The main fa√ßade of the Hospital had an arched gallery with buttresses in its ground floor. The entrance of the Chapel was located in the middle of the Hospital fa√ßade and was reached by a monumental stairway. Contemporary drawings show that the portal of the Chapel was a notable work in Manueline style, the Portuguese version of late Gothic typical of King Manuel I's time. Organisation The rules of the Hospital were granted by King Manuel I in 1504, and were based on the rules of contemporary hospitals in Florence and Siena. Initially the Hospital had three infirmaries (enfermarias) located in the upper storey, where the ill were treated. The groundfloor was occupied by the Hospital personnel (around 50 people, many of whom lived in the building). The first floor housed dependencies like the kitchen, refectory and pharmacy, as well as rooms for abandoned children (called expostos), beggars and the mentally ill. Initially, it is estimated that the Hospital was capable of housing around 250 people, with 2500-3000 people being treated every year. Even though the premises were victim of several fires, the facilities were greatly expanded until the middle of 18th century, when the Hospital had around 12 infirmaries. It was the most important health institution in the city and an important centre for the practical study of anatomy and medicine in Portugal. The Hospital was initially administered by a provedor appointed by the King, but after 1564 the Hospital was run by the Irmandade da Miseric√≥rdia (Brotherhood of the Mercy), an important Portuguese religious charity established in 1498 that exists to this day. Destruction Things changed with the massive 1755 earthquake, in which a great part of the city was destroyed by the quake itself and the fire that followed. The situation was worsened by the fact that the All Saints Hospital was greatly damaged, and the surviving patients and wounded by the quake were housed in undamaged convents and palaces. The government of King Joseph I, headed by the Marquis of Pombal, quickly started rebuilding the Hospital, which was soon treating the ill again. For some reason, possibly related to financial constraints, the Hospital was never fully rebuilt. The Hospital facilities were transferred in 1775 to the building of the Col√©gio de Santo Ant√£o, a Jesuit college that was confiscated by the Crown after the Jesuit Order was expelled from Portugal in 1759. The new Hospital was renamed Hospital de S√£o Jos√©, paying hommage to King Joseph I. The remnants of the All Saints Hospital were demolished and a new square was created, the Pra√ßa da Figueira (Square of the Fig Tree).

Formerly the lead vocalist and frontman of the metal band Nachtmystium, Judd also contributed to musical acts and projects such as Twilight, Krieg, and Hate Meditation. He previously performed under the stage name \\"Azentrius\\". Judd's heroin addiction was publicly exposed in 2013 after he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor theft. His reputation was further damaged when fans, band mates, and business partners openly accused Judd of conducting fraudulent business practices. Judd later admitted to deceiving fans and left the music industry in 2014. He later reunited Nachtmystium in 2017 to perform two live shows and record a new studio album before dissolving the band in 2020. Biography =Early life= Judd was raised in Wheaton, Illinois, and took an early interest in music due to his parents' taste in classic rock. He saw The Allman Brothers Band perform live when he was in the second grade, and cites it as a major influence on his musical career. Judd took up the guitar when he was twelve years old, and began to listen to heavy metal shortly later. =Musical career= He began playing in bands in his late teens. He served as the vocalist and guitarist for Ezurate and in the now-defunct thrash and black metal band Helms Deep. In his spare time, he worked at Metal Haven, a heavy metal record store in Chicago. Judd eventually founded Nachtmystium with a friend as a side-project, which he originally operated out of his parents' basement. He started to become more involved in Nachtmystium, then a raw black metal band, after receiving positive feedback from his audience. Judd incorporated psychedelic elements into the band's material, influenced by his love for progressive rock bands such as Pink Floyd and The Allman Brothers Band, while also using various black metal elements. Nachtmystium became Judd's primary focus and his most successful music project. Outside of Nachtmystium, Judd founded an independent record label, Battle Kommand Records, with Rebecca Clegg in St. Charles, Illinois. In 2005, he was commissioned by the Swedish underground label Total Holocaust Records to create the black metal \\"supergroup\\" Twilight. Twilight featured Wrest from Leviathan, producer Sanford Parker, Stavros Giannopoulos of The Atlas Moth, Imperial of Krieg, Malefic of Xasthur, and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. Additionally, Judd was a session musician on Krieg's final album Blue Miasma (2006). Judd for many years performed under the pseudonym \\"Azentrius\\". Also, Judd played guitar on Obscurus Advocam's 2007 album Verbia Daemonicus. Judd voiced critical opinions towards modern black metal. In an interview with MetalReviews.com, he claimed \\"most bands are just carbon copies of each other, musically, lyrically, image-wise and ideologically, although I question how big and evil half these maggots are\\". Judd voiced a similar opinion in an interview with The Metal Crypt, stating \\"Fuck modern black metal. There are a few good bands, but there are millions of horrible clones and overrated bands that are doing nothing new.\\" However in a 2008 interview with The Daily Herald, he claimed to respect what he viewed as \\"real\\" black metal, and added \\"as a fan of black metal, I'm offended by someone who calls their music black metal and incorporates outside elements.\\" While Nachtmystium was founded as a black metal band, Judd insisted the band had \\"left the black metal scene\\" after 2004. In an interview with Thrashpit.com, Judd stated, \\"It was cool at first but we're really not a traditional 'spikes and paint' band.\\" In 2013, after advising that Nachtmystium was on \\"something of a hiatus\\", Judd announced that his new band, Hate Meditation, would be his \\"main focus\\". Hate Meditation featured Judd on vocals and guitar, Wrest on bass, Job Bos of Dark Fortress on synth, and Sam Shroyer of Vitandus on drums. The band signed a two-album deal with Indie Recordings and released its debut album, Scars, in 2013. Judd suspended his musical career due to substance abuse and legal problems in 2013. He announced Nachtmystium would reunite to perform two live shows in 2017 and work on new studio material. Judd dissolved Nachtmystium in June 2020. Judd stated he would continue to work on writing and producing music, which will be released anonymously. =Personal life= Judd's musical career was abruptly halted when he was arrested on October 5, 2013 and faced misdemeanor theft charges. He admitted to stealing and pawning his roommate‚Äôs guitar while trying to buy heroin. Judd had previously openly admitted to using cocaine, hallucinogens, marijuana and other recreational drugs since he was a teenager. However, Judd alleges he began using heroin after he severely injured his leg in 2009 and a doctor prescribed opioids to help him cope with pain. Judd purchased medication with opiates from the black market when his prescription had expired and later regularly abused heroin while touring with Nachtmystium. Before Judd's arrest, Century Media Records, Nachtmystium's label at the time, paid to send him to a drug rehabilitation clinic in Los Angeles operated by MusiCares. Judd claims the therapy was initially helpful, but he relapsed after embarking on a tour. Judd (left) performing with Nachtmystium in 2008. Judd disbanded Nachtmystium on November 13 after the band finished recording their final studio album, The World We Left Behind. Judd thanked Nachtmystium's fans for their support over the band's 13-year run and then retreated from his music career to seek additional treatment for his heroin addiction. Judd was encouraged by his fans' support during this period and considered reforming Nachtmystium to pursue future musical projects. In July 2014, Judd re-entered the music industry as an online re-seller of heavy metal albums and band merchandise. A few months later, fans accused Judd of withholding merchandise that they had purchased from his Facebook storefront. Judd defended himself by stating that Century Media Records did not provide him with sufficient albums and amounts of merchandise for distribution. Nachtmystium's Facebook storefront was suddenly taken down and fans were not given closure about their orders. Century Media Records ultimately announced that they would provide a copy of the band's latest album to fans with a proof of purchase, and that they were parting ways with Judd and Nachtmystium. On September 10, Neill \\"Imperial\\" Jameson, one of Judd's former bandmates and close friends, released an article for Vice Media detailing his first-hand accounts of Judd's heroin addiction. Jameson accused Judd of cheating him and his fellow Twilight band mates out of money on numerous occasions. He also alleged that Judd was accepting purchase orders from fans and then pocketing the money with no intention of providing them with merchandise. Yosuke Konishi, owner of Nuclear War Now! Productions, publicly accused Judd of withholding several albums that he had purchased in 2012. Another business partner, Alexandre Martinez of Deadlight Entertainment, alleged that Judd commissioned him to produce Nachtmystium merchandise and press albums, but never paid for the services. Alt URL Judd later admitted to defrauding several customers in order to feed his heroin addiction. Judd terminated his online business and became homeless without a source of income. He lived in a homeless shelter before finally seeking drug rehabilitation therapy in October 2015. Judd eventually left Chicago to stay with relatives in Louisville, Kentucky and continue his rehabilitation. He openly addressed his victims and fans in January 2016 to apologize for his wrongdoings. While Judd has stated he does not have plans to record or produce new music in the future, he announced that Earache Records had acquired the rights to redistribute Nachtmystium's studio albums. He also announced the label would release a new compilation album, titled Retox: Remixes and Rarities, which contains previously unreleased demos and cover tracks from Nachtmystium and Twilight. Judd uploaded a copy of the album onto YouTube for fans to stream for free. He released the following statement: \\"Thank you all for your patience and I do hope to make things right with everyone I can who fell victim to my addiction issues by not receiving orders for music or merchandise. I intend on giving away every single record and CD I receive of these reissues, if that‚Äôs what it takes, to make things right with the fans whom I wronged and did not fulfill orders for.\\" In 2018, MetalSucks published an article containing reports and testimonies from online customers that Judd defrauded within the past year. Judd refuted these specific allegations and claimed he had been sober since 2015. After ending Nachtmystium, Judd stated he wished to pursue a career as a licensed drug rehabilitation counselor in California.

Often mistakenly equated with the Rheingau, the Gau was based around the former Roman administrative district of Civitas Mattiacorum. The name Kunigessuntera is documented the first time in 819. A main court (fiscus) with senior officials were present in Wiesbaden; sub-courts existed in Biebrich and Mosbach (now part of Biebrich). The Gau probably had already been created by the beginning of the reign of Charlemagne (after 771) as the private property of the Frankish king and his heirs. This was the former Alemannic Rheingau divided into three sections - the K√∂nigssondergau was now between the Lower Rheingau (which retained the name \\"Rheingau\\") and the Upper Rheingau region south of the lower Main. The K√∂nigssondergau originally covered the area bordering on Kemel (now a constituent community of Heidenrod) and B√§rstadt (now a constituent community of Schlangenbad) in the west, starting at Walluf, and extending east to Eppstein and Hofheim, with the Kriftel as eastern border. In the north, the Taunus and the former Roman limes formed the border. The southern boundary was the Rhine. The Gau was adjacent in the west to the Lower Rheingau, in the northwest to Niddagau, in the east to the Maingau, and in the southeast to the Upper Rheingau. The administration of the K√∂nigssondergau lay in the hands of the gau counts, whose royal court (curtis) stood near today's Hessian Parliament in Wiesbaden. The tower house, built in the 9th and 10th centuries, was expanded in the Middle Ages into a castle. The income from the K√∂nigssondergau belonged to the Frankish king who used it to finance his court. Parts of the gau areas, villages and castles were given as fiefdoms to reward followers. Over time parts were also given to the Archdiocese of Mainz (e.g. Oestrich, Geisenheim, R√ºdesheim am Rhein and Lorch in the Veronese donation of 983 by Emperor Otto II) or sold to other owners. Emperor Otto III donated Biebrich and Mosbach in 991 the Selz monastery in Alsace. Gifts and awards were also given to feudal nobles and counts, and by the 12th Century the House of Nassau held count rights in and around Wiesbaden. Count Henry II of Nassau, 1198‚Äì1251, won Wiesbaden and the K√∂nigssondergau as imperial fiefdom in 1214. Also, the Lords of Eppstein penetrated by exploiting bailiwick rights, purchase and inheritance in the K√∂nigssondergau, where they became opponents of the Counts of Nassau.

Biography He was born of German parents, the father's side having a strong military tradition. His father fell in Flanders in 1917: two uncles held high rank in the German Army, and of these Ernst von Oven (1859-1945) was the highest ranking German officer in the field at the Armistice and subsequently reported directly to the Minister of Defence. Both helped form Freikorps to combat communism and the revolutionary movement in Germany. Wilfred von Oven joined the SA and National Socialist German Workers Party on 1 May 1931, but resigned from both exactly one year later in protest at the shift of Nazism further to the right (the \\"Stennes Revolt\\"). Oven was interested in journalism and served with the Legion Condor in Spain as a war correspondent. After obtaining an Army commission in 1939 he served with the Propaganda Ministry as a war correspondent reporting from the fronts in Poland and the Soviet Union during the Second World War. In 1943, with the rank of Lieutenant, the OKW appointed him as Goebbels' Press adjutant, which he remained until the end of the war. In a German TV documentary on the \\"German Resistance\\", Oven described the events of the 20 July plot which he witnessed. On the afternoon in question the Propaganda Ministry on the Wilhelmstrasse, with Goebbels inside, was surrounded by disloyal troops. Goebbels ordered Oven to discover whether escape was possible. He found they were trapped but reported that the telephone system was still working, an oversight by the plotters which assisted in their downfall. At the capitulation in 1945 Oven went into hiding under an assumed name to escape Allied internment: Werner Naumann, the replacement Propaganda Minister for Goebbels whose assistant Oven would have been, fled to Argentina in 1946, where Oven arrived in 1951. Oven was declared \\"persona non grata\\" by the Federal German Embassy in Buenos Aires and remained a committed Nazi. He continued to reject Christianity for paganism in Argentina. He was married, and the author of several books and numerous magazine articles. In his book Auschwitz: The Nazis and The 'Final Solution', Laurence Rees discusses an interview he conducted with Oven. He was asked if he could sum up his experience of the Third Reich in one word, what would it be, to which Oven responded: \\"Paradise\\".

From 1902 to 1991, it was a mining community. It has a population of 5,296,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Rotherham Retrieved 28 August 2009 increasing to 6,900 at the 2011 Census. History The name Thurcroft has Norse (Viking) roots as 'thorr' means thunder in old Norse, so is probably at least a thousand years old. According to A. D. Mills in his Dictionary of English Place-Names, the first mention of Thurcroft is in 1319. Thurscroft: 'Enclosure of a man called Thorir. Old Scandinavian person's name + Old English word Croft. Thurcroft Hall Until the 20th century, Thurcroft consisted of Thurcroft Hall, the longtime holding of the Mirfin family, and three other farms. Thurcroft Hall was held by the Mirfins (sometimes spelled Mirfield) until 1644 when Robert Mirfin, the lord of the manor, died childless. The property then was carried into the Beckwith family by his widow, who also happened to be his stepsister. The Mirfields and the Levetts of nearby High Melton were interrelated, Thomas Levett having married Robert Mirfin's sister Elizabeth.Mirfin/Myrfin of Slade Hooton, Thurcroft, Brookhouse, Thurcroft Web, thurcroftweb.co.uk Coal mining The land on which the village would one day stand was bought in the 1800s (along with the Hall) by a Sheffield brewer (Thomas Marrian), whose son, Thomas Marrian Jr, leased the coal mining rights to Rother Vale Collieries in 1902. Modern Thurcroft only really came into being with the sinking of the coal mine in around 1909. Many of the terraced houses on the area showed characteristics of coal mining in the last quarter of the 19th century and first quarter of the 20th century. The population grew from next to nothing in 1900 to around 2,000 in 1923: Shortly after which the village saw hard times in the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, when 250,000 free meals were given out between May and September. By 1947, the mine employed over 2,000 men, and in the 1984/85 miners' strike the pit was again involved in industrial action. The coal mine was closed in 1991 despite attempts by the workforce to buy it out. Church and parish St. Simon and St. Jude's church Before 1995, Thurcroft was within the parish of Laughton-en-le-Morthen and a permanent stone church was only built in 1937, making it one of the newest on this site (although there was a Methodist chapel built in 1917, and a village cemetery was established in the 1920s). Thurcroft parish became separate from Laughton in 1995. The old Catholic Church is now home to TCF Church.TCF Church Big Local Residents have created a Big Local partnership made up of local residents and people from organizations involved in the area which will then create a local plan using the ideas of local people. Once the plan is agreed with the Big Local Trust, the partnership can start to spend the money on the plan's priorities.

Biography  = Early life = Gonzo Greg is a native of Massachusetts, but he moved to California in 1978. Always wanting to work in radio, he began attending Long Beach City College in 1984 to pursue an associates degree in telecommunications. = Career = Gonzo began his radio journey in 1984 as an intern at famed glam metal radio station KNAC in California. At the time, KNAC was an alternative rock station. When the format changed to a \\"Pure Rock\\" format, many of the former DJs left the station, giving Gonzo his first opportunity to move from intern to DJ. He started with the overnight shift before being moved to the night shift. In 1989, at the peak of glam metal's heyday, he was assigned to the coveted morning show, effectively launching his career. Some notable moments from his tenure at KNAC include: Being the first DJ in the world to play Motley Cr√ºe's \\"Dr. Feelgood\\", when the band brought in a test pressing, debuting the band Guns N' Roses, and providing a video voice-over for \\"Painkiller\\", the last Judas Priest album featuring front-man Rob Halford. It was also at KNAC that he acquired the radio name \\"Gonzo Greg\\". When Gonzo left KNAC in 1991, he was immediately hired on at WMMR in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There he hosted nights, and his show boosted ratings dramatically, becoming #1 among listeners. In 1993, while at WMMR, Gonzo was offered a morning show position at KRXX (93X) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. When WMMR would not match the more lucrative offer during contract renegotiation, Gonzo left Philadelphia. Unfortunately, his stay at 93X was short, as the station was sold in 1994, a few months after his hiring. During his time there, he hosted segments for Comedy Central's \\"RadioActive Television\\", and Tommy Chong surprised them with a guest appearance on their final broadcast. Gonzo was promptly picked up by WTFX-FM in Louisville, Kentucky, for their morning show. While working at WTFX-FM, he also hosted a variety of local television segments. After leaving WTFX-FM, Gonzo went straight to work at KCAL in San Bernardino, California, where former KNAC co-worker Rick Shaw was now program director. He continued to host mornings at WTFX until 1997. Gonzo's next stop was WKRK in Detroit, Michigan, when it was K-Rock, to work for legendary programmer John Gorman. He began working there as host of the PM drive, until the format was changed to \\"Extreme Radio\\", during which time he moved to afternoons. When the station changed formats, this time to \\"FM Talk\\", he hosted mid-days with co-host Erin Carmen. After a few months, Erin left Detroit to work in Chicago, and Gonzo continued hosting solo, before moving off-air to work as Production Director until mid-2000. From Detroit, Gonzo went on to WRZX (X103) in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was here that he created The Big Dumb Show with co-hosts Don Stuck and Beau Asner. The morning show was a success, with ratings at one point surpassing The Bob & Tom Show. Highlights from The Big Dumb Show include \\"Who Wants to Get Married at XFEST\\" (featuring reality TV star Rick Rockwell), where Gonzo dressed as the Pope, and their \\"Pumpkin Propulsion\\" competition, which made international news. Due to budget cuts, Gonzo and his co-hosts, which later included Nicole Padberg, left X103. It was not long after their departure from X103 that Gonzo and Nicole were approached by KVGS in Las Vegas, Nevada, to host the morning show at the new Area 108. The Big Dumb Show was renamed to Gonzo in the Morning, and Gonzo won the Las Vegas Weekly's Readers' Choice Award for \\"Best Radio Personality\\". Gonzo in the Morning continued until summer of 2007, when they were let go due to budget cuts. Gonzo worked at KVGS again in 2009, first hosting PM drive, then mornings again. The station changed formats to BOB-FM, and he continued to work mornings until his departure from the station in 2013. On January 8 and 9, 2016, Gonzo participated in the 30th anniversary KNAC reunion. On January 8, a podcast hosted by former KNAC DJ Ted \\"Thrasher\\"/\\"Thrash Pie\\" Pritchard, called \\"Thrashpie Radio\\", held a special show that featured many of the stations DJs, production directors, and other former employees, sharing stories about their time at the station. Also included were audio clips from various KNAC events, as well as bumpers and promos. On January 9, Los Angeles rock station KLOS hosted a five-hour KNAC tribute, led by Stew Herrera, which duplicated KNAC's format, complete with jingles, bumpers, clips, and songs that were iconic to the station. Interviews were conducted with Scott Ian, Rob Halford, and Lars Ulrich. Aside from Gonzo and Stew, other former DJs present included Long Paul, Thrasher, and Dangerous Darren. = Current = Gonzo continues to reside in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he works as a voice-over talent. He also moonlighted as an announcer for the local roller derby league, the Sin City Roller Girls, through their 10th season. He continues his love of radio with Gonzo.fm. The internet radio stream regularly features complete podcasts of various incarnations of the show, usually on the anniversary of their air date. He is also a semi-regular guest host on the podcast \\"Phil Hulett and Friends\\", which is hosted by former KNAC DJ \\"Philthy Phil\\" Hulett, and produced by former KNAC DJ Mike Stark. The show is broadcast from L.A. Radio Studio in San Pedro, California. After a several-year stint working as the sound engineer for the Nuclear Bombshells (a post-apocalyptic burlesque troupe), Gonzo is now the program director for Highway Radio. Broadcasting out of Pawn Plaza (where Pawn Stars is filmed), the studio is responsible for three long-standing stations that broadcast between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Influences  Among Gonzo's influences was WRKO-AM morning host Dale Dorman; his first time on the air was calling in to win a contest. He knew for certain he wanted to be a radio DJ when his father took him to WBCN in Boston. He saw Tony Baradini through the window, and he sat watching the DJ for an hour while his dad conducted business. WBCN morning host Charles Laquidara, who hosted a weekend show under the alter-ego \\"Duane Ingalls Glasscock\\", was also a huge inspiration. His biggest influence, though, was Frazer Smith of KLOS. Other influences include Freddie Snakeskin, KROQ's Jed the Fish, and Dr. Johnny Fever of WKRP in Cincinnati.  Style  Gonzo Greg (also called Gonzo, Gonz, or The Gonz) derives his style of reporting from Hunter S. Thompson's Gonzo Journalism, as his name is a tribute. His entertainment can sometimes be crude, and most generally humorous. He tends to report the news with a disregard for accuracy and leans more toward delivery and humor. His daily routine of Morning Radio games, criticism of government and pop culture, and constant sarcasm has resulted in a cult following of listeners, some listening via streaming internet radio.

Boxing In boxing, a triple champion is a boxer who has won world titles in three weight classes. For most of the 20th century it was a remarkable achievement, possibly securing one a spot in the International Boxing Hall of Fame with other immortals of the sport. Beginning in the 1970s, triple champions have become increasingly more common because of the numerous weight divisions (17) and the countless professional boxing entities that claim a \\"world\\" championship. The first triple champion of boxing was Bob Fitzsimmons when he added the Light Heavyweight (175 lbs) crown to his World Middleweight (160 lbs) and Heavyweight (200+ lbs) belts on November 25, 1903. Barney Ross was the first boxer to simultaneously hold world titles in two different weight classes when he won World Lightweight (135 lbs) title and World Light Welterweight (140 lbs) against Tony Canzoneri on June 23, 1933. Later Ross won the World Welterweight (147 lbs) Title from Jimmy McLarnin on May 28, 1934. Henry Armstrong was the first man to hold three titles in three divisions simultaneously. He won the World Featherweight (126 lbs) title from Petey Sarron on October 29, 1937, the World Welterweight (147) title from Barney Ross on May 31, 1938, and won the World Lightweight Title (135 lbs) in his next fight, on August 17 against Lou Ambers. Armstrong then immediately vacated the Featherweight Title because he could no longer make the weight. Wilfred Ben√≠tez was the youngest ever champion at any weight. Benitez first won the WBA Light Welterweight (140 lbs) Title from Antonio Cervantes on March 6, 1976, at age 17. He moved up in weight to win the WBC Welterweight (147 lbs) title from Carlos Palomino on January 14, 1979, and finally won a third title when he added the WBC Light Middleweight (154 lbs) title from Maurice Hope on May 23, 1981. When boxing thought that the limit were the level of the new multiple triple champions that barrier were broken by some boxers to create the new level of milestones in boxing: the Quintuple Champions. Grappling & Wrestling In grappling type martial arts, a triple champion is someone who has won a championship, medal (gold, silver or bronze) or a tournament in all three categories: -Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) -Professional Wrestling \\\\- and in either Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Amateur Wrestling or Judo. Brock Lesnar and Ronda Rousey are examples on the professional level. Combat Sports In general combat sports, a triple champion (or triple crown champion) is someone who wins a championship belt in all three categories: Striking (Boxing or Kickboxing), Grappling and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). This is considered the most prestigious accomplishments in all combat sports. It is worth noting that boxing, grappling and MMA each have their own respective triple champion title within each individual sport. Formula One Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna are all triple world champions. Touring Car racing Andy Priaulx and Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez both won three world championships.

He was for many years a mainstay of the Sadler's Wells Company in London. Born in the Adelaide suburb of Malvern and educated at Unley High School, Matters at first took up a position in the South Australian bureaucracy and was admitted as an associate of the Federal Institute of Accountants in 1925, but in his spare time pursued his interests in music and singing. He obtained a place at the Elder Conservatorium of Music at Adelaide and studied singing under Clive Carey, graduating AMUA in 1926. In due course he won the Sun Aria Prize and other coveted awards, and began to attract a good deal of attention. He was invited by Dame Nellie Melba to join her touring company, and met with such success that he decided to make music his profession. In 1930 he abandoned his government position and went to England, at first continuing his studies in London under Johnston Douglas. He became a member of the Westminster Abbey choir and was given a good deal of solo work. But his dramatic ability, fine voice and stage presence led him towards the theatre, and in 1932 he joined the Vic-Wells Opera Company, his debut being as Valentine in Gounod's Faust at the Old Vic in 1933. He soon made himself established as a popular Figaro, Don Alfonso, Silvio, Escamillo, and Sharpless. He afterwards found his own favourite role as Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, and also became famous in the title role in Falstaff, as Dr Bartolo, Don Giovanni, the Die Walk√ºre Wotan and as Wolfram in Tannh√§user. In 1935, 1938 and 1939 he joined the British singers in the international seasons at Covent Garden, where he was particularly successful as Kurwenal in Tristan und Isolde, with Eva Turner as Isolde. During the war he returned to Australia and maintained a very successful concert and opera career there. In 1946 he was invited back to England, to Sadler's Wells, where he resumed his regular position in the company, also making occasional guest appearances at Covent Garden. He was especially effective as Scarpia, and also as Simone Boccanegra in the English revival opposite Howell Glynne's Fiesco, and recorded excerpts of this work at the time. He was also a most effective Papageno, Rigoletto, Don Carlo, Iago, Germont p√®re, Conte di Luna, Amonasro, Pizarro and Governor, Varlaam, Kecal, Peter, Figaro and Almaviva, Mephistopheles, Telramund, and the Dutchman. In 1949 he took the role of Eochaidh, the King, in the revival of Rutland Boughton's The Immortal Hour at the People's Palace. At Covent Garden on 26 April 1951 he created the role of the Pilgrim in Ralph Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress, and in 1953 that of Cecil in Benjamin Britten's Gloriana. In October 1954 he created the role of Sir William Hamilton in Lennox Berkeley's opera Nelson at Sadler's Wells.

She served in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean and provided destroyer escort protection against submarine and air attack for Navy vessels and convoys. She was named in honor of Thomas Mack Wilhoite who was awarded the Silver Star posthumously for his brave actions in Morocco during Operation Torch. She was laid down on 4 August 1943 at Houston, Texas, by the Brown Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 5 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Corinne M. Wilhoite, the mother of Ensign Wilhoite; and commissioned at Houston on 16 December 1943, Lt. Eli B. Roth in command. World War II North Atlantic operations After her shakedown out of Great Sound, Bermuda, from 9 January to 10 February 1944, Wilhoite underwent post-shakedown availability at the Charleston Navy Yard from 11 to 21 February. She then got underway for Gibraltar with Convoy UGS (United States to Gibraltar) 34 on 23 February. On two occasions during the voyage, the destroyer escort depth charged presumed submarine contacts with inconclusive results. After turning the convoy over to British escort vessels once she had passed through the Strait of Gibraltar, Wilhoite returned to the United States with Convoy GUS (Gibraltar to the United States) 33 and arrived at New York City on 3 April. After a 10-day availability at the New York Navy Yard, the destroyer escort operated briefly with submarines and PT boats and conducted antiaircraft firing practice in Block Island Sound, Brooklyn, New York, before shifting south to the Tidewater area to pick up Convoy UGS-40 in Hampton Roads late in April, led by the 2. The transatlantic passage proved largely uneventful; but, as the Allied ships transited the Strait of Gibraltar, the British antiaircraft cruiser , the destroyer , and two minesweepers equipped with special jamming apparatus, and , joined the convoy. A recent increase in German air activity had prompted concern over the safety of UGS-40, a large and important convoy consisting of some 80 vessels. Attacked by Luftwaffe aircraft At 2106 on 11 May, Wilhoite's search radar picked up \\"bogeys\\" some northeast of UGS-40. Two minutes later, the screening ships commenced their barrage. Observers in Wilhoite saw the attacking planes, torpedo-carrying Junkers Ju 88s, sheer away from the flak, fly aft along the transport screen to the northward, and then cut across the stern of the convoy, circling. Soon, as the Ju 88s came around the stern of the convoy, Wilhoite, coordinating the defense of that sector, sent up several barrages with her 3-inch, 40- and 20-millimeter guns. About 2123, one Ju. 88 singled out Wilhoite as her target and attacked. The destroyer escort responded by bringing all her guns to bear and fired such a heavy and accurate barrage that the German pilot dropped his torpedo about from its target. The plane, apparently damaged by the flak, then banked sharply and disappeared in the ship's smoke screen. Heavy Luftwaffe losses The heavy antiaircraft fire from the convoy's escorts and the support by friendly fighters downed an estimated 17 of the enemy torpedo planes. The convoy itself suffered no losses and safely reached its destination, Bizerte, Tunisia. For his part in directing Wilhoite's highly successful sector defense of UGS-40, Lt. Roth, the ship's commanding officer, received a Letter of Commendation. Sinking of Block Island Wilhoite rested at Bizerte from 13 to 21 May before getting underway to return to the United States with Convoy GUS-40. At 21:05 on 29 May, however, Wilhoite and were detached from the screen of GUS-40 to go to the aid of Task Group (TG) 21.11 which the had brazenly attacked northwest of the Canary Islands, torpedoing and . The former sank quickly, but the latter remained afloat while and cooperated in sinking the U-boat. The latter then took the stricken Barr in tow. Wilhoite and Evarts arrived on the scene at 17:15 on the 30th; soon thereafter, and Ahrens sailed for Casablanca, Morocco. The remaining ships then set course for Casablanca as well, avoiding the track of two homeward-bound U-boats reportedly in the area. On the 31st, the small seaplane tender arrived and assumed command over the little force. At 09:30 on 1 June, Eugene E. Elmore cast off the tow of Barr, and Wilhoite picked it up. Moving ahead at eight knots, Wilhoite towed the damaged Barr, despite the letter's cracked hull which made the task of pulling the ship immeasurably more difficult by causing the damaged ship to yaw. Good damage control in Barr later lessened that problem; and, as the convoy neared Casablanca on 5 June, a Dutch tug, HMRT Antic, joined and took the damaged destroyer escort in tow, relieving Wilhoite. PC-480 then relieved Wilhoite and Evarts of screening duties as the ships neared the swept channel at their destination. Commended for towing Barr to safety Upon finishing fueling at Casablanca, Wilhoite departed that Moroccan port, her commanding officer, Lt. Roth, having earned a second Letter of Commendation for his ship's performance in towing Barr to safety, and sailed to New York with GUS-41. After her arrival there, the ship received repairs at the New York Navy Yard before she sailed on 24 June for battle practices in Casco Bay, Maine. She later acted as a target in training exercises for submarines operating out of New London, Connecticut, before she once more touched at New York and shifted south to Norfolk, Virginia, where, on 21 July, she joined a hunter-killer task group based around the escort carrier . Four days after her assignment to Bogue's group, TG 22.3, Wilhoite sortied with that carrier and the rest of her screen, , , , and , bound for Bermuda. While exercising in that area on antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and night battle practice, Bogue and her consorts honed their respective and collective skills in those areas for the rest of July and into the following month. At 06:30 on 3 August, however, a message arrived that abruptly cut short the training. TG 22.3 was to proceed to the vicinity of for offensive operations against a westbound enemy submarine. At 1646 on the next day, Wilhoite picked up a sound contact and attacked at 17:02; listeners picked up seven detonations but could ascertain no positive results. At 14:05 on the 7th, the destroyer escort laid two \\"hedgehog\\" projectile patterns and one standard depth charge pattern on a target later evaluated as a school of fish. Undaunted, the Bogue group pressed on with the hunt. Their vigilance and training ultimately paid off. At 00:43 on 19 August, night-flying aircraft from Bogue attacked a submarine running on the surface. Wilhoite was the first ship to hear the transmission and relayed it to Bogue. Six minutes later, Haverfield, Janssen, and Swenning headed for the scene, detached to take part in the hunt while Wilhoite and Willis remained with Bogue as her screen. Meanwhile, the carrier launched planes, maintaining the start of a continuous air patrol over the area. Unfortunately, the trio of destroyer escorts returned empty handed at 12:25 on the 20th. However, no sooner had they returned, when carrier aircraft reported attacking a submarine that had just surfaced. Wilhoite, Janssen, Haverfield, and Willis headed for the scene, a spot some distant, hearing a report at 14:43 that the submarine (which had apparently submerged but had been damaged and brought to the surface) had again surfaced and was under attack. Sinking of German Submarine U-1229 Ultimately, the planes from Composite Squadron 42, flying from Bogue, inflicted enough damage on the submarine, later identified as , to force the German crew to abandon ship. While Bogue's airmen watched, U-1229s crew went over the side. The submarine, scuttling charges apparently set, exploded and settled into the Atlantic. Later, at 16:10, the destroyer escorts arrived on the scene; Wilhoite picked up one body of a German sailor, who was summarily buried at sea. Janssen picked up U-1229s survivors. Wilhoite, along with the other units of TG 22.3, later received the Presidential Unit Citation for the group's submarine-hunting activities. Wilhoite had been a part of the powerful and sustained offensive during a period of heavy U-boat activity threatening the uninterrupted flow of supplies to the European theater that, since the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, had assumed great importance. As the citation text concluded: \\"The gallantry and superb teamwork of the officers and men who fought the embarked planes and who manned Bogue and her escort vessels were largely instrumental in forcing the complete withdrawal of enemy submarines from supply routes essential to the maintenance of our established military supremacy.\\" But, for ships like Wilhoite, there was little time to rest on her laurels. Germany was not beaten yet; there would still be more U-boats to fight. Proceeding to Argentia after TG 22.3's kill of U-1229, Wilhoite and her consorts again went after enemy submarines reported in that area. Attacks made over a three-day period, 8, 9, and 10 September, were all unsuccessful. Wilhoite then patrolled off the Grand Banks before she sailed for the New York Navy Yard at the end of September for voyage repairs. Upon completion of her yard period on 7 October, Wilhoite trained off Montauk Point, Long Island, in ASW tactics before she got underway for Norfolk on 14 October with the remainder of CortDiv 51. Joining Bogue at Norfolk and becoming TG 33.3, the ships headed south to Bermuda, arriving there on 23 October. Wilhoite and her consorts subsequently trained in ASW tactics out of Great Sound, Bermuda, into November. Wilhoite returned to New York with TG 33.3 before the unit put to sea for a \\"barrier patrol\\" between Brown's Bank and the Nova Scotia entrance to the Gulf of Maine in early December. Detached from Bogue's screen at 12:35 on 7 December, Wilhoite assisted in developing a sonar contact until 11 December, when Wilhoite headed for Norfolk. Wilhoite rejoined Bogue's screen and departed Norfolk on the day after Christmas 1944, bound for Bermuda. The destroyer escort patrolled with TG 22.3 out of Port Royal Bay before she returned to New York for repairs on 16 January 1945. Wilhoite resumed operations with that illustrious aircraft carrier on 20 January, planeguarding for her as she conducted carrier qualifications (carquals) off Quonset Point, Rhode Island. Detached from that duty on the 21st, Wilhoite sailed for Casco Bay, Maine, where she exercised in ASW and gunnery for a week. She again screened and plane-guarded for Bogue off Quonset Point into early February, while the carrier once more ran carquals for her embarked air group. The destroyer escort then spent a period of availability at the New York Navy Yard from 8 to 19 February before she engaged in training operations into late March, out of Casco Bay and Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Wilhoite departed Casco Bay on 28 March and, on the. following day, rendezvoused with TG 22.14‚Äîthe unit assigned the task of hunting a reported southbound U-boat placed by intelligence information at . At 11:39 on 31 March, Janssen's part of Task Unit (TU) 22.3.1‚Äîmade a sound contact. Wilhoite picked it up soon thereafter and attacked at 1146, her \\"hedgehog\\" hurling a pattern of projectiles six minutes later. She left two deep explosions soon thereafter but could ascertain no evidence of having scored any hits. Attacked by an iceberg After another brief period of unsuccessful \\"barrier patrols\\" between 1 and 6 April, Wilhoite trained out of New London, Connecticut, in ASW tactics with and units of Hague's TG 22.3, before she resumed active U-boat hunting activities. At 23:27 on 19 April, Wilhoite went to general quarters to investigate a radar contact and, at 23:43, illuminated the area with star shell. The object of the attention turned out to be a large, drifting iceberg. Meanwhile, the war on the European continent had been nearing its end; but the Battle of the Atlantic continued. Soon after the encounter with the iceberg, Wilhoite resumed \\"barrier patrols\\" with Bogue's TG 22.3. She was screening the carrier when Bogue's planes spotted a U-boat running on the surface at 1300 on 23 April. The aircraft attacked, but the U-boat \\"pulled the plug\\" and went deep in time to escape. U-546 sinks Frederick C. Davis The next day, torpedoed and sank , the last American combatant ship loss in the Battle of the Atlantic. However, the U-boat had little time to savor the victory, for the entire scouting line of destroyer escorts moved swiftly to the scene to rescue their sistership's survivors and to commence ASW operations. U-546 was brought to the surface, damaged, and sunk by gunfire from the destroyer escorts, quickly avenging Frederick C. Davis's loss. Over the next few days, Wilhoite conducted more \\"barrier patrols\\" as part of a group of warships carrying out sweeps in scouting line formation. The ships formed around two escort carriers, Bogue and , the former patrolling to the south, the latter to the north. At 20:00 on 7 May, Wilhoite, , and proceeded to the scene of a \\"disappearing radar contact\\" that had been made by . At 2125, Wilhoite reached the point of contact and commenced a search in company with Haverfield, Flaherty, Otter, Swenning and . At 22:02, however, the search was cancelled abruptly, and the ships returned to their previous scouting line stations. While the ships had been engaged in their search, Germany, worn down by pressure from the western Allies on the one hand and the ceaseless heavy pressure by the Russians on the other, surrendered at Reims, France, on 7 May. World War II, as far as the European theater was concerned, was over. Stateside repairs Nevertheless, Wilhoite remained at sea on \\"barrier patrol\\" until 9 May, when she headed for New York City. The destroyer escort was repaired there from 11 to 19 May before she shifted south for more major repairs and alterations at the Charleston Naval Shipyard in preparation for the ship's upcoming deployment to the Pacific, still very much an active theater of war in the spring of 1945. Transfer to Pacific Theatre operations Wilhoite trained at Guant√°namo Bay after her refit at Charleston and then headed for the Pacific, transiting the Panama Canal on 16 July. Arriving at San Diego, California, on the 24th, Wilhoite sailed for Hawaii with CortDiv 59  , , and ‚Äîarriving there on 5 August. In ensuing days, Wilhoite and her consorts trained in Hawaiian waters. Wilhoite had arrived too late to participate in active operations, however, because the war in the Pacific ended while she was training in the Hawaiian Islands. On 14 August 1945 (west of the international date line), the Japanese capitulated. Wilhoite departed Pearl Harbor on 20 August bound for Saipan in the Marianas. After her arrival there, she escorted to Okinawa in company with the minesweeper . While engaged in that local escort duty, Wilhoite was forced to reverse course off Okinawa during a typhoon; the ship did not enter Buckner Bay, but proceeded instead back to Saipan. Meanwhile, the surrender of Japanese garrisons was proceeding apace. In late September, Wilhoite sailed for Marcus Island, relieving there as station ship on 27 September. Anchoring off the south shore of the island, Wilhoite supported the small American occupying force in case of any trouble with the garrison of some 2,400 Japanese troops still on the island. By 8 October, the latter was on board the transport Daikai Maru and on its way back to Japan. Wilhoite, herself, in company with LCI-336, departed Marcus on 12 October, bound for Saipan. Wilhoite subsequently operated on local escort missions to Pagan Island, Agrihan Island, and Iwo Jima and then she supported the American occupation of Japan until 6 January 1946. At that time, the destroyer escort‚Äîher task in the Far East completed‚Äîsailed for the United States, via Saipan and Pearl Harbor. After touching at San Diego, she proceeded on to New York, via the Panama Canal. Following a complete overhaul at the New York Naval Shipyard, Wilhoite shifted south to Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she was decommissioned on 19 June 1946 and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Converted to Radar Picket Ship Her sojourn in reserve was to last through the Korean War of 1950 to 1953. Taken out of reserve and reactivated in 1954, Wilhoite underwent an extensive conversion to a radar picket ship, receiving sophisticated radar equipment. Reclassified to DER-397 on 2 September 1954, Wilhoite was recommissioned on 29 January 1955 at the Charleston Naval Shipyard, Lt. Comdr. Lambert V. Forde in command, but remained in dockyard hands at Charleston for final installation of equipment and further tests until 22 March. She then proceeded, via Norfolk, Virginia, to Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, for a rigorous 10-week shakedown. After her post-shakedown availability, Wilhoite sailed for the Pacific on 20 July; she officially became part of the Pacific Fleet's Cruiser-Destroyer Force on the 24th. Upon her arrival at her new home port, Seattle, Washington, on 12 August, Wilhoite became a unit of CortRon 5 and soon commenced what would become a regular routine of duty as a coastal radar picket ship under the overall direction of Commander, Western Continental Air Defense Command. In the next three years and seven months, Wilhoite conducted a total of 30 picket tours before she sailed for Hawaii and her new home port of Pearl Harbor on 4 March 1959. Support North Pacific and Deep Freeze ‚Äô61 operations For the next four years, Wilhoite operated out of Pearl Harbor on \\"barrier patrols\\" and special operations; ranging as far north as Adak, Alaska, where, on one occasion in December 1964, a heavy storm with winds buffeted the ship against a pier, causing some damage. In 1961, Wilhoite took part in Operation \\"Deep Freeze '61\\", crossing the Antarctic Circle on 8 February. During that cruise, she visited ports in New Zealand and Australia before she returned to Pearl Harbor via Pago Pago, Samoa. Mission of mercy Besides \\"special operations\\" on \\"barrier patrols\\" from Pearl Harbor, Wilhoite carried out search and rescue (SAR) missions, ready for any eventuality while on station. During her third SAR patrol, in the autumn of 1963, the ship sighted an approaching Japanese fishing vessel, Kayo Maru. Wilhoite subsequently took on board Eichi Nakata, a man who had been bitten by a shark, and carried him to Midway Island, where he received medical treatment. After that mission of mercy, Wilhoite returned to Pearl Harbor on 22 October 1963. Supporting Vietnam War operations By the mid-1960s, however, further changes were in store for the veteran warship. The growing pace of incursions by North Vietnamese-backed Viet Cong communist guerrillas against South Vietnam had resulted in escalating American support of the latter. Wilhoite accordingly was deployed to the Western Pacific (WestPac) in the spring of 1965, beginning a cycle of WestPac tours that lasted into 1969. Wilhoite conducted intermittent WestPac deployments, with corresponding \\"Market Time\\" patrols off the coast of Vietnam, into January 1969. Hers was unsung duty‚Äîlong hours of ceaseless patrol, aiding the fledgling South Vietnamese Navy in detecting and preventing supplies, weapons, and other materials from being infiltrated into South Vietnam by the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese. Often assisted by only two small boats, a Coast Guard patrol boat and aircraft, Wilhoite upon occasion had the responsibility for patrol over of ocean‚Äîan ample assignment for a ship with the size and range of a radar picket destroyer escort. Occasionally, there were periods of excitement to enliven an otherwise tedious duty. On 19 June 1967, Wilhoite relieved on Operation Market Time station and assumed the duties of \\"mother ship\\" to two Navy \\"Swift\\" (PCF) boats, providing berthing accommodations for extra crew members and supplying them with food, fuel, and fresh water. At approximately 2000 on 11 July, a \\"Market Time\\" patrol aircraft detected a steel-hulled trawler running darkened some from the coast of South Vietnam, on a westerly heading. Wilhoite, notified by radio of the trawler's course, set hers to close and identify the ship, commencing covert surveillance as soon as she picked up radar contact. The next morning, 12 July, Wilhoite closed for identification purposes but later opened the range. By that point, the trawler had changed course, heading away from the coast; Wilhoite accordingly maintained surveillance for three more days. Entering the \\"Market Time\\" area, the trawler drew more pursuers ‚Äì , , and PCF-79‚Äîall under the command of Comdr. C. R. Stephan, embarked in Wilhoite. On 15 July, Wilhoite intercepted the unidentified trawler five miles (8 km) from the beach. Ignoring calls to surrender broadcast by a psychological warfare unit embarked in Point Orient, the trawler was soon taken under fire, running aground in flames on a sandbar at the mouth of the River De Say Ky in Quang Ngai province. Capturing a Viet Cong trawler Throughout the night, Wilhoite and the other ships intermittently fired into the beached trawler; the following morning, a party went on board the wreck to inspect the damage and learn the nature of her cargo. The holds were found jammed with guns, ammunition, and explosives‚Äîthe largest arms cache captured during the Vietnam War. Ultimately relieved of her \\"Market Time\\" patrol duties on 26 July, Wilhoite sailed for Hong Kong and a period of recreation. Alternating the tours of duty on Market Time stations with periods in port at Hong Kong, Sasebo, and Yokosuka, Wilhoite periodically returned to such ports as Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay. Not all of the ship's highlights of \\"Market Time\\" operations were combat-oriented ones. On 6 September 1968, for example, Wilhoite was called upon to perform an SAR mission, while she was riding out the tail-end of Typhoon Bess. Assigned to locate a lost Vietnamese Navy PGM, Wilhoite centered her search on a point some from the port of Da Nang. Although she never sighted the PGM, however, the radar picket destroyer escort maintained contact via voice radio; and ultimately, the PGM was able to reorient herself and continue on her voyage. Later, while returning to her patrol station, Wilhoite came across an Army landing craft, LCU-1481, which had been adrift and lost for some 48 hours. Typhoon \\"Bess\\" had proved a nuisance to the LCU, for it had caused damage that had rendered the craft powerless. Wilhoite stood by while another LCU was dispatched from Da Nang to take the stricken LCU-1481 in tow and bring her to port safely. Later that autumn, Wilhoite received an availability alongside the veteran destroyer tender at Subic Bay from 25 to 28 September. On the latter day, the radar picket destroyer escort sortied for \\"Market Time\\" once more, relieving the Coast Guard cutter on station. Wilhoite later saw her first action of that deployment when she was called upon to deliver gunfire support in an area north of An Thoi. There, Wilhoite shelled an area heavily infested with Viet Cong, destroying or damaging several enemy junks that had attempted to infiltrate mat√©riel from the north. Wilhoite departed Vietnamese waters on 15 January 1969, bound for Hawaii. She stopped for fuel at Subic Bay and at Apra Harbor, Guam, before she continued on, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 1 February. After a period of tender availability alongside , from 17 February to 3 March, Wilhoite underwent a restricted availability at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard before she conducted her sea trials at the end of May. On 2 June, the radar picket destroyer escort departed the Hawaiian Islands for the west coast; and she arrived at Bremerton, Washington, a week later. There, on 2 July, Wilhoite was decommissioned. Final deactivation Simultaneously struck from the Navy List, Wilhoite was sold on 19 July 1972 to General Metals Corp., Tacoma, Washington, and subsequently scrapped. Awards Wilhoite received the Presidential Unit Citation, a Navy Unit Commendation, and one battle star for World War II service and six battle stars for her duty in Vietnam.

On 6 August 1941, the Usta≈°a killed around 600 women and children from the village of Prebilovci, Herzegovina, by throwing them into the Golubinka pit, near ≈†urmanci. During the summer of 1941, the Usta≈°a continued with mass murders of Serbs ‚Äì of 1,000 inhabitants of Prebilovci, 820 of them were killed, while in the neighbouring places of the lower basin of the Neretva river, including ≈†urmanci, around 4000 Serbs were killed. The Golubinka pit was covered with concrete in 1961. Persecution During the Second World War the Serb inhabitants of Prebilovci, a small village near ƒåapljina, fell victim to genocide. At the beginning of 1941, the village had a population of 1,000. Earlier, it had given volunteers to join the Bosnian-Herzegovinian uprising against the Turks in 1875-78, and contributed 20 volunteers to the Serbian Army in Salonica during World War I. Many villagers died as prisoners in the Austro-Hungarian Empire concentration camps. Croat nationalists reportedly harboured hatred at Prebilovci's contribution to the World War I Serbian army.Duliƒá, Tomislav. Utopias of Nation: Local Mass Killing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1941-42, Uppsala University Library (2005), page 162 Prebilovci was surrounded on the night of 4 August 1941 by some 3,000 Usta≈°a made up of the village's Croats. Massacre In August 1941, some 650 women and children were taken away from their homes, moved to ≈†urmanci where they were later thrown into natural pits around that area ‚Äî either dead or half-dead according to accounts ‚Äì together with a thousand or so other Serbs from the ƒåapljina and Mostar municipalities. The men were in the mountains, hiding, in the deluded belief that the Ustas≈°e would not harm their women and children.Copley, Gregory (editor-in-chief). The Balkan Conflict: The Psychological Strategy Aspects Defense & Foreign Affairs Strategic Policy Volume XX, Number 12, 31 December 1992, pp. 4‚Äì9. The Serbs of Prebilovci were herded together with other Serbs from the western part of Herzegovina and eventually six carloads of them were sent off on a train that was supposedly to take them to Belgrade. They were ordered out of the six cars they occupied at a town called ≈†urmanci, on the west bank of the Neretva, and marched off into the hills never to return.Deschner, Karlheinz. God and the Fascists: The Vatican Alliance with Mussolini, Franco, Hitler, and Paveliƒá, Prometheus Books, 8 October 2013. > In Prebilovci and ≈†urmanci, Herzegovina, where 559 Serbs, all old men, women > and children, were slaughtered; the two Catholic priests, Ilija Tomas and > Marko Hovko were among the murderers Atrocities began in the villages including the killing of 50 infants who were swung by their legs so that their heads could be dashed against the school wall. There was continuous rape of young girls both there and at other locations. On 6 August, 150 Usta≈°a under Ivan Jovanoviƒá (known as \\"Blacky\\") were joined by another 400 Usta≈°a from ƒåapljina, and took the prisoners in rail cattle-cars to Vranac, some 500 to 1,000 m from the Golubinka pit, one of many such natural, near-vertical cave formations in the region, where some 550 Usta≈°a took small groups of prisoners to the pit and, family-by-family, pushed them into it. The initial vertical fall was some 27 m, followed by a 100 m steep slope to the base of the pit. Small children were thrown up into the air before falling into the pit. One woman is known to have given birth as she fell into the pit. The newborn infant died with her under the crush of bodies. Here is how the Catholic Bishop of Mostar, Alojzije Mi≈°iƒá, described this and other massacres perpetrated by the Ustasha around the city of Mostar, in his letter to Bishop Alojzije Stepinac, dated 7 November 1941: :People were captured like animals. Slaughtered, killed - thrown alive into the abyss. Women, mothers with children, adult girls, women and children, both male and female were thrown into the pits. The Vice Mayor of Mostar Mr. Baljiƒá, proclaimed publicly, as a clerk, he should be silent instead of talking, that in the town of Ljubinje, into only one pit, 700 Orthodox Christians were thrown. From Mostar and ƒåapljina six full rail wagons transported wives, mothers and girls younger than ten, to the station at ≈†urmanci, where they were taken to the hills, living mothers with children thrown down steep cliffs. Everyone was tossed down the cliffs and killed. In the parish Klepci, from surrounding villages N. N., 3,700 Orthodox Christians were killed. The poor souls, they remained peaceful. I won't enumerate further. I'd go too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied, taken outside the town and killed like animals One entire clan of 78 persons died in the crush of the Golubinka pit near the village of ≈†urmanci. And after all were pushed into it, the Usta≈°a sat around drinking and celebrating. Only 170 villagers survived. Forty-five survived the crush of the pits and escaped later to tell of the disaster. 300 children and infants were massacred that day alone. Aftermath A group of 170 villagers, which primarily consisted of men, survived the massacre. Two Roman Catholic priests, Ilija Tomas and Marko Hovko, were among the murderers. Few of the Usta≈°a who took part were tried after the war had ended. Only 14 of the 550 known Usta≈°a were brought to trial after the war, and one of the judges was himself an Usta≈°a close to the crime. Six were sentenced to death, the remainder received prison sentences, the majority around three years. The Golubinka pit was opened in 1990 when Serbian priests headed by patriarch Pavle entered it and held a memorial service over the remnants of the victims. Around 1550 remnants were taken out from the pit. In 1991, on the 50th anniversary of the massacre, some 4000 victims, taken out from the Golubinka and from the surrounding 15 pits, were buried in the crypt of the Church of the Synaxis of Serbian Saints and Martyrs of Prebilovci. In June 1992, members of the Army of the Republic of Croatia burnt the village and destroyed the crypt and the church. The remnants of the holy relics are today held in the crypt of the temple under reconstruction.

Because the brook that runs through the park regularly floods, it remained clear of the housing developments that grew up on either side. However, the central area was used as a tip until 1978 and restoration began in 1993. Rimrose is a Hybrid word from Old English hrim (modern \\"rim\\"), 'border' and Celtic ros meaning \\"moor\\" or \\"heath\\". Following concern over young people riding scrambler bikes in the park, resulting in at least one serious accident, the police launched a crackdown in 2015. Formation Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Rimrose Valley, October 2017 The formation of the valley in its current state can be dated back over the last 1.6 million years, during which time sand, peat and clay deposits have built up over parts of the valley, which itself has formed as a result of sandstone strata erosion. The outer edges of the valley were put to use as farmland, particularly on higher ground where flooding was less likely, though throughout the 20th century much of the farm land has been restricted to the northernmost regions of the valley. Geology Rimrose Valley Nature Reserve, run and managed by the Sefton Ranger Service Rimrose Valley is now part of the Mersey Forest and the most southerly extent of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain. The south of the valley contains the Brookvale Nature Reserve which is the only one in Sefton that is not on the coast and is, along with Fulwood Way in the north, a Site of Special Local Biological Interest. Layout Because of the size of the park, the area has been divided into five colour-coded zones that allow people to narrow down their location if they need to contact the emergency services. The north‚Äìsouth walking distance is approximately , with a grade of moderate and an estimated walking time of 90 minutes. Highway proposals In 2013, under the leadership of Peter Dowd, Sefton Council placed members of council, as well as its Chief Executive, to the Port Access Steering Group to work with Highways England and Peel Ports (as well as other agencies) to establish \\"a permanent highways solution\\" due to the expansion of the port. Sefton Council was chairing the Port Access Steering Group on behalf of the Liverpool City Region (LCR). From this, in the same year, Sefton Council commissioned the Atkins Group to conduct a feasibility study for the road solution. The report/study was completed in February 2014. In November 2014, Atkins made a presentation to the LCR Port Access Steering Group, three of whom (including the chair) were from Sefton Council. In their presentation, Atkins summarised the latest thinking in relation to the Online Option and the Offline Option, as well as considering tunnel options which were deemed to be \\"cost-prohibitive\\". The Online and Offline options would later be referred to as Option A and Option B. Following the presentation, the Steering Group gave Highways England the task of deciding on Option A or B. The announcement came two years after the completion of the feasibility study in February 2014. In 2003 a similar study had been conducted, commissioned by Sefton Council, and the preferred option then was Rimrose Valley. Plans were announced in February 2016 which proposed a new ¬£200m road could be built through Rimrose Valley to link directly into the A5758 Broom's Cross Road in an effort to reduce the heavy congestion on the A5036 Dunnings Bridge Road; Sefton Council rejected the proposal in March 2017, citing the desire to instead build a tunnel to overcome the congestion concerns. In December 2017, Highways England attempted to defend their position that a bypass road is the preferred option to provide a direct link between the Port of Liverpool and Switch Island junction, citing considerable cost and disruption if a tunnel, estimated to cost six times as much, were to be constructed. In 2018, Sefton Council brought a judicial review against Highways England on the basis that it felt a tunnel should have been presented as an option. The High Court ruled in favour of Highways England, but the legal action resulted in a considerable delay to the project. In August 2019, Highways England were forced to publicly apologise for claiming that, in this judicial review, a judge had upheld its preferred route for a road through Rimrose Valley. This was inaccurate: the judge had simply ruled that it was not legally required to consult on a tunnel option. A local campaign group, named \\"Save Rimrose Valley\\", was formed to oppose Highways England's plans and to demand that sustainable, non-road solutions to the movement of freight to and from the Port of Liverpool are researched and presented to the public. In just over two years, the campaign has attracted a large and active following. They appeared on Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show in 2018 to debate the scheme with Highways England's Regional Delivery Director, Tim Gamon. It also staged what the Campaign for Better Transport described as \\"the biggest anti road demonstration in recent memory\\" in September 2018. \\"Hands Across the Valley\\" was attended by more than 700 people and was covered by BBC North West Tonight and Granada Reports. The event was attended by local MPs Bill Esterson and Peter Dowd, as well as Friends of the Earth and the Campaign for Better Transport. Members of the public formed a giant heart on the parkland and linked arms along its central path. In February 2019, members of the campaign group met with Shadow Transport Minister Rachael Maskell to raise the issue and to ask for support. In March 2019, the campaign secured the support of Friends of the Earth's CEO, Craig Bennett. He visited the country park, spoke with local schoolchildren and members of the public and called for Highways England to scrap the scheme. In September 2020, Highways England announced that the project was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and would not be completed until at least 2025.

Her parents were Emperor Dom Pedro I, the first ruler of an independent Brazil, and Archduchess Leopoldina of Austria. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Paula was the couple's third child; she lost her mother at the age of three and her father at the age of eight, when he abdicated and left Brazil for Portugal, where he wanted to restore the throne of Paula's eldest sister, Maria da Gl√≥ria, who should have become queen regnant of Portugal. After her mother's death, Paula and her siblings were mainly raised by a slave, a wet- nurse and a statesman whom Pedro I had appointed to take care of his five children. Paula and her siblings were present when her father married his second wife, Am√©lie de Beauharnais, who eventually became like a mother to the children. After her father abdicated and left, the children were left alone in Brazil, as his father took with him Am√©lie; the two had a daughter abroad. Paula became severely ill in late 1832 and died in early 1833, at the age of nine. She was buried, at her father's request, in Rio de Janeiro.  Biography  = Birth = The Emperor's Second Marriage (detail) by Jean-Baptiste Debret. Behind the Emperor are his children by order of precedence: Pedro, Janu√°ria, Paula and Francisca. Paula was born on 17 February 1823 at the Pa√ßo de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian capital; one week later, the princess was baptized Paula Mariana Joana Carlota Faustina Matias Francisca Xavier de Paula Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga by Bishop Jos√© Caetano da Silva Coutinho, at the Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro. The last four names were always bestowed on members of the royal family and the name Paula honored S√£o Paulo, where the independence (see below) had been signed. She was the third daughter of Emperor Dom Pedro I and his first wife Archduchess Leopoldina of Austria. Through her father, she was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza, which was an illegitimate branch of the Capetian dynasty. She was thus a granddaughter of Jo√£o VI. Through her mother, she was a niece of Napoleon and a first cousin of Franz Joseph I of Austria. As the daughter of a member of the ruling Portuguese royal house, Paula was referred to by the honorific Dona (Lady) from birth. The year before Paula's birth, the independence of Brazil had been declared in September 1822; as Pedro only had daughters, Paula was supposed to have been fourth in the line of succession to the Portuguese throne. However, under Portuguese law, Paula was a foreigner having been born after the independence and was thus excluded from the line of succession. However, her elder sister Maria da Gl√≥ria was not excluded from the succession having been born in 1819; she ascended the Portuguese throne after the death of Jo√£o VI and the abdication of Pedro on 28 May 1826. Instead of her mother, Paula was suckled by the same wet nurse who would later suckle the Prince Imperial. = Life = Acclamation of D. Pedro II by Debret. In the up-left corner, Pedro is on the balcony with his sisters. On 11 December 1826, Empress Leopoldina died after either giving birth to a stillborn sonSee and . or suffering a miscarriage.See and . However, at the time there were rumors that purported Pedro had actually killed Leopoldina during a heated discussion. Supposedly, Pedro had kicked Leopoldina in the womb, causing her to have a miscarriage and die. Domitila de Castro, Pedro's longtime mistress, and Philipp von Mareschal, the Austrian minister in Brazil, had witnessed the quarrel and Mareschal stated that the couple exchanged only insults and nothing else.See and . Pedro greatly missed his wife and arranged a second marriage, this time to Napoleon's step-granddaughter, Am√©lie de Beauharnais von Leuchtenberg. The two were married on 17 October 1829. Am√©lie became like a mother to Pedro's five surviving children, D. Maria da Gl√≥ria (born 1819), D. Janu√°ria (born 1822), D. Paula, D. Francisca (born 1824) and the Prince Imperial (born 1825), all of whom adored their new mother. The Emperor abdicated the Brazilian throne of 7 April 1831 and left Brazil for Portugal in order to support his eldest daughter's claim to the Portuguese throne. Pedro's vessel left that very morning and Pedro, now styling himself \\"the Duke of Braganza\\", took with him Am√©lie, Maria da Gl√≥ria and his sister D. Ana de Jesus. The children never saw their father or stepmother again. Before he left, Pedro had appointed Jos√© Bonif√°cio de Andrada as legal guardian, Mariana de Verna Coutinho to continue as aia, and an afro-Brazilian war veteran named Rafael to generally tend to his children. Out of these three, Rafael remained loyal to the Emperor until his death in 1889. Left with no one else, the children formed close bonds with each other, they were even \\"dependent on each other.\\" Besides this, the three sisters were obedient and helpful towards their brother, who was now Emperor of Brazil and outranked them. The children regularly attended Gl√≥ria Church, studied, played and had meals as a family; this is something that Bonif√°cio and Coutinho tended to personally. On 9 April 1831, the Prince Imperial was acclaimed as the new Emperor. While the Emperor was displayed at a palace window, his sisters stood by him.See and . Meanwhile, in Paris, D. Am√©lie gave birth to a daughter, Princess D. Maria Am√©lia. = Death = Pa√ßo de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, where Paula was born, lived and died. 1817 painting by Debret. Paula was described as \\"filled with peace, fortitude and resignation\\", or \\"the most quiet and gentle of Leopoldina and Pedro's children\\" and seldom complained, even though she had suffered from frequent health problems ever since infancy; she was often so sick that she could not do her lessons with her siblings. She had never been robust or entirely healthy until the middle of 1831, when she had a bout of strength: she was able to lead an active life and grew taller. However, at the end of 1832, she became severely ill. Historian Roderick Barman suggests that Paula had meningitis; however scholar Mick Isle introduces the theory that Paula had malaria. Isle further states that the royal doctors administered quinine (both orally and anally), soups, leeches, mustard plaster and applied acidic substances to her skin; this made the Princess \\"scream out in pain.\\" Nonetheless, these techniques were useless, for Paula died on 16 January 1833, one month shy of her tenth birthday. Upon learning of his daughter's impending death, the Duke of Braganza, who was in Porto, made two requests to Bonif√°cio: \\"the first is to keep for me a bit of her beautiful hair; the second is to place her in the convent of Our Lady of Good Aid and in the same spot where her good mother, my Leopoldina for whom even today I still shed tears of longing, is located ... I ask you as a father, as a pitiful desolate father, to do me a favor and go in person to deposit next to the body of her mother this fruit of her womb and on this occasion pray for one and other.\\" Paula was given a grand state funeral which was not seen again until the death of Pedro II's son, Prince Imperial Afonso, in 1847. Her current burial place is in Rio de Janeiro's Convent of Saint Anthony, next to her brother Jo√£o Carlos and later her nephews Afonso and Pedro. Her death made her siblings feel even more abandoned.The Convent of Our Lady of the Good Aid was demolished in 1911. Even prior to the demolition, in 1876, the bodies of the princes and princesses buried there were transferred to a mausoleum at Rio de Janeiro's Convent of St. Anthony. In 1834, the Duke of Braganza also died.

He was also briefly the last Archbishop and Elector of Cologne and Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster before those territories were secularised in 1803.

Opened in 1996, the centre is located in the area bordered by Jervis Street, Upper Abbey Street, Mary Street, and Liffey Street. The centre has a total of 70 stores including clothing, food and electrical outlets. History The centre was built on a 12,000 m2 (3-acre) former hospital site, which was bought in 1994 at a cost of ¬£5.97 million. The centre was built at a cost of ¬£76 million. Most of the facade of the former Hospital has been retained and incorporated into the Shopping Centre. The Jervis Shopping Centre opened in 1996 and extends to 37,000 m2. The centre was originally anchored by Debenhams, M and S and Tesco, and boasts 750 Car Parking spaces. The property is strategically located on Mary /Henry Street, one of Irelands busiest high streets. Since 1996 Jervis Shopping Centre has established itself as Dublin's most successful and vibrant shopping environment. Although its main entrance is on Mary Street, the centre is named for the Jervis Street Hospital on whose site it was built following the hospital's closure in the late 1980s. The existing Marks and Spencer store on Mary Street was incorporated into the new centre, with the other anchor tenants being Quinnsworth (now Tesco) and New Look in the unit formerly occupied by Debenhams. The centre is notable in that, as the first major shopping centre opened during the economic boom of the late 1990s, it marked the first appearance of many British 'high street' retailers in the Republic of Ireland. These included Boots, Dixons, Debenhams, Next, and Argos among others, which have gone on to become major names in the main streets of Ireland. This contrasted with existing Irish shopping centres at the time which were usually anchored by local names such as Dunnes, Roches Stores (since taken over by Debenhams), and Penneys. Not all of the new arrivals were successes: British Home Stores opened a store in 1996 having previously sold all of its Irish interests to Primark; however, the outlet was not a success and was later sold to Heatons. The centre was one of the first to introduce the food court concept to Ireland, with outlets including KFC, Spud U Like, and Harry Ramsden's. Other major restaurants in the centre include Burger King. The Centre is owned by Paddy McKillen, Padraig Drayne and Paschal Taggart. The success of the centre also led to its rival, the 1980s-built Ilac Shopping Centre giving its appearance a complete modernisation. This was completed in mid-2008.

The MƒÅori name is patƒì or patatƒì. It occurs in lowland to lower montane forests from sea level to 1200 m in the North Island, South Island, and Stewart Island, covering a latitudinal range from 34¬∞S to 47¬∞S. It prefers damp, shady parts of the forest and is common along stream banks and on shady forest roadsides. It is the only New Zealand representative of the genus Schefflera, which has 200 species of shrubs and small trees in the tropics and subtropics. Description The soft, thin leaves of patƒì are palmate, with from three to nine leaflets Patƒì is a small, spreading tree up to 8 m high with stout branches. The leaves may have from three to nine leaflets. The leaflets are thin and soft to the touch with sharply serrated margins. In the north of the North Island, S. digitata has a juvenile stage in which the leaflets are divided into irregular toothed lobes. The inflorescence is a large, multi- branched panicle up to 35 cm across, with umbels of small greenish flowers arising at irregular intervals along its length. Each umbel contains up to ten flowers each about 7 mm in diameter. The dark violet fruits are fleshy, round, and grooved when dry. They are about 3.5 mm in diameter and take two or three months to ripen. Ecology and uses The sap of the tree has medicinal uses, and has been used to treat ringworm and sores on the skin. The wood was used by MƒÅori to make fire by friction. Patƒì is the most common host of the parasitic plant Dactylanthus taylori. This is a root parasite that was known to the MƒÅori as pua-o-te-reinga, 'the flower of the underworld'. Wood rose is threatened with extinction, which is thought to be due to several factors including the poaching of plants for sale as curios. Although patƒì is easy to grow in New Zealand, it is not popular in cultivation, as its thin, soft foliage cannot match the glossy attractiveness of the similar Pseudopanax species, nor that of the Australian species Schefflera actinophylla, which is also easy to grow in the North Island. S. digitata is sometimes grown by Northern Hemisphere gardeners thinking it may be relatively hardy, but like many New Zealand trees, patƒì is not tolerant of prolonged cold conditions.

The facility featured a ¬º mile dragstrip, a 14-turn road course, and a ¬º mile short oval. At its peak, it had capacity for over 30,000 fans. History In the late 1940s, the dirt- surfaced Breckenridge Oval opened on the site. In 1952, the oval was shortened and paved as a 1/2 mile asphalt oval, and the 8,000-seat facility was renamed Speedway Park. In 1967, the 1/4 mile drag strip opened and had a full length of . In 1968, the road course opened in time for the first Can-Am race. Over the years, the facility also hosted Formula Atlantic, Formula 1600, Formula 5000, Trans-Am, as well as NHRA-sanctioned drag racing. Qualico Developments was the land owner in the latter years. The track closed in 1982, after the area was annexed by the City of Edmonton. Qualico then converted the land to housing. Edmonton would be without any form of professional racing until Capital City Raceway Park opened in 1991.

He was the 128th and the last Governor-General of Portuguese India. Background He was the only son of Manuel Caetano da Silva (1870‚Äì1926) and his wife Maria da Encarna√ß√£o Vassalo (1869‚Äì1922), and was the brother of the feminist author and anti-government campaigner Maria Lamas. He was married, with two daughters, Joana and Aurora. Governor-General of Portuguese India In 1958, he was nominated to replace Paulo B√©nard Guedes as the 128th Governor-General of the Portuguese State of India. At the same time, he was also appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Portuguese Armed Forces in India. When the Republic of India sought to annex the territories of Goa, Daman (from which had been previously separated in 1954 and annexed by India in 1961 the enclave of Dadra and Nagar Haveli) and Diu from Portuguese control in December 1961, Manuel Vassalo e Silva, recognizing the futility of facing a superior enemy, disobeyed direct orders from the Portuguese President of the Council of Ministers Ant√≥nio Salazar to fight to the death and surrendered the following day to the Indian invasion, following several losses and the destruction of a battleship. After that he fell into disgrace at the eyes of Salazar, who never accepted the fait accompli of the annexation. Vassalo e Silva was greeted with a hostile reception when he returned to Portugal. He was subsequently court martialed for failing to follow orders, expelled from the military and was sent into exile. His rank and freedom were restored only in 1974, after the fall of the regime, and he was given back his military status. He was later able to conduct a state visit to Goa, where he was given a warm reception.

The Center is owned and operated by the City of Tulsa and guided by the TPAC Trust, of which the Mayor of Tulsa is a member. Its first Managing Director was Robert D'Angelo.

When, in the early 1970s, it was determined that a new, updated theatre was needed, the Theatre Advisory Committee, headed by Charles E. Norman, was formed. Many different scenarios were studied, including the restoration of the Tulsa Municipal Theatre (built in 1914), and the Akdar Shrine theatre (vintage 1925). The committee became aware that John H. Williams, president of The Williams Companies, had purchased a nine-block area of land that he intended to develop. Williams‚Äô original plan was to build a new headquarters for his company, which would consist of two 30-story buildings flanking Boston Avenue at 3rd Street. The scheme was reconfigured to make Williams‚Äô headquarters one tall tower instead of two smaller buildings, and locate it in the middle of Boston Avenue at Second Street. The land between 2nd and 3rd Streets on Cincinnati, occupied by a vacant Hotel Tulsa, was then made available and was given to the City by Williams for a performing arts venue. In May 1973, Williams and community philanthropist Leta Chapman made an offer to the citizens of Tulsa: If Tulsa citizens would vote to fund half of a performing arts center, Williams and Chapman would raise the other half. A bond campaign was launched, giving the proposed PAC the slogan ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs Place.‚Äù The bond election, held in August 1973, was passed by 69%. The new Tulsa PAC was funded at $14 million. =Construction= Prior to construction, a private corporation, PACI, was formed to take over the ownership of the construction project and then return the PAC property back to the City of Tulsa after building completion. This allowed for construction to move ahead at greater speed ahead of the rampant inflation. A committee was formed to procure art for the building. One percent of all construction costs of public buildings in Tulsa must be spent on art for the building being constructed to comply with an ordinance adopted by the City of Tulsa in 1969. A combination of local, national and international art, including a large representation of Native American art, was purchased.http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=69&articleid;=040718_Br_h1_showa# The works of artists such as Alexandre Hogue,http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=272&articleid;=20110908_272_D4_SusieK101993 Wolf Kahn, Barbara Hepworth, Louise Nevelson and Woody Crumbo were among the original collection. The initial plan for the Tulsa PAC was for one large performance hall seating almost 2,400 and a smaller proscenium theater seating approximately 430. During the initial construction phase, two more studio theaters were added to the plans. The acoustics for the facility were the work of Bolt, Berenek and Newman, the firm responsible for the acoustics at Lincoln Center in New York City. Ultimately, the cost of building the Tulsa PAC was approximately $19 million. Additional revenue sources were found to fund the difference. The facility underwent a major retrofit in the early 1990s to help the PAC become more accessible to people with disabilities. In 2000, the PAC completed a major expansion that included an additional studio theater, a large reception hall and a large suite of restrooms. This was the second addition of restrooms since the building opened in 1977. Performance Venues The Tulsa PAC has four main performance venues: Chapman Music Hall, John H. Williams Theatre, Liddy Doenges Theatre and Charles E. Norman Theatre. The PAC also houses two smaller event venues, the Kathleen P. Westby Pavilion and the Robert J.

In 1847, an uncommon iron-nickel-phosphide ((Fe,Ni)3P) mineral was named in his honor by Wilhelm Karl Ritter von Haidinger (1775‚Äì1871). The mineral is found in meteorites, and is known today as schreibersite. As a zoologist, he was the first to perform a comprehensive anatomical study of the olm, a cave-dwelling, aquatic amphibian. The plant genus Schreibersia (synonym Augusta, family Rubiaceae) was named in his honor by Johann Baptist Emanuel Pohl.BHL Taxonomic literature : a selective guide to botanical publicationsGRIN Taxonomy for Plants Schreibersia, Pohl Biography He earned his medical doctorate from Vienna in 1798, but also studied botany, mineralogy and zoology at the university. For a brief period of time he assisted his uncle, Joseph Ludwig von Schreibers, with his medical practice in Vienna. As a young man, he also toured museums throughout Europe. In 1802 he was an assistant of natural history and agricultural sciences at the University of Vienna. In 1806 he was appointed director of the Viennese natural history collections (Naturalienkabinette), which became his life's work. Schreibers was involved with all aspects of natural sciences, and he embarked upon total organizational overhaul of the museum's natural history collections. During his time as director, the size of the museum's library grew from a few scientific books to a collection of over 30,000 volumes. Here, he stored the results of his personal research work, as well as a collection of meteorites  Schreibers' main interest of study. On 31 October 1848 some parts of the collections of the museum were destroyed by fire during the course of bombardment of Viennese revolutionaries by the Austrian Imperial Army. Schreibers was devastated by the loss, and retired soon afterwards. Fortunately his collection of meteorites was saved from destruction.

The nearest service stations are also at Blayney, one of them offering unmanned 24-hour service by credit card. The entire locality is within Blayney Shire, but all but the westernmost farms are in the Bathurst postal district and so have its postcode.

He was initially sentenced to a 30-year jail term for a murder committed during the robbery of a security van in 1997. Criminal career and escape attempts Born in Montpellier, France, Payet spent his childhood in Lyon before settling in Marseille. In 1988, he was convicted of aggravated assault and again in 1993 for conspiracy. On November 20, 1997, he participated in an attack on a Banque de France armored car in Salon-de-Provence during which a guard was killed. He was arrested along with √âric Alboreo in Paris in January 1999. On October 12, 2001, he escaped from a prison in the village of Luynes in the French department of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne on board a hijacked helicopter with Fr√©d√©ric Impocco. On October 18, Impocco was captured and brought in for questioning in Paris. On April 14, 2003, Payet organized another helicopter escape from the Luynes prison, this time of Franck Perletto, Michel Valero, and √âric Alboreo, who had been arrested with him in 1999. They were caught three weeks later. In January 2005, Payet was sentenced to 30 years in prison for murder in connection with the 1997 armored car hijacking in Salon-de- Provence. Mandat d'arr√™t europ√©en lanc√© contre Pascal Payet, Le Point, 16/07/2007 This sentence was upheld in May 2006 following an appeal by the cour d'assises of Var. In December 2005, he published an open letter on his blog entitled \\"The Saga of My Transfers\\" (French: \\"L'√©pop√©e de mes transferts\\") in which he criticized the conditions of his imprisonment. Before writing the letter he had gone on a hunger strike at a prison in Metz in protest against having been transferred nine times in 30 months. In January 2007, he confessed to organizing the 2003 escape and was sentenced to an additional seven years in prison, while his co-conspirators were each sentenced to three. He was also sentenced to another six years for his own escape in 2001. By July 2007, Payet was one of the most closely surveilled prisoners in France and was never kept at the same prison for more than six months. He had been officially classified as a \\"d√©tenu particuli√®rement surveill√©,\\" or a prisoner under especially high surveillance, and placed in solitary confinement. Despite these measures, on July 14, 2007, taking advantage of Bastille Day celebrations, four masked men hijacked a helicopter from Cannes ‚Äì Mandelieu Airport. They used it to free Payet from his solitary confinement in a prison in Grasse. Pascal Payet s'est √©vad√© en h√©licopt√®re de la maison d'arr√™t de Grasse, Nouvelobs.com, 15/07/2007 The helicopter landed some time later at Brignoles, 38 kilometres north-east of Toulon, France on the Mediterranean coast. Payet and his accomplices then fled the scene and the pilot was released unharmed. Two days after his escape, a European arrest warrant was issued against him. Payet was captured on September 21, 2007, in the town of Matar√≥, a suburb north of Barcelona in Spain. Payet, auteur d'une √©vasion en h√©licopt√®re, arr√™t√© en Espagne, Le Point, 22/09/2007 He was transferred to French custody on October 4, 2007, along with two accomplices who had been captured with him, Alain Armato and Farid Ouassou. He was then imprisoned in a location which has been kept secret for \\"security reasons.\\" On June 25, 2008, the cour d'assises of the Alpes-Maritimes department sentenced him to 15 years in prison with no chance of early release for a series of armed robberies and assaults against police officers while he evaded custody. On April 8, 2011, the cour d'assises of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne sentenced him to an additional five years of prison for his 2007 escape. His three accomplices were sentenced to nine, seven and six years. Some other prisoners judged complicit in the escape were given lesser sentences. Payet is married and has two children.  In popular culture  Pascal Payet and the actor who portrays him on Netflix (Thierry Brouard) After making headlines around the world for his audacious Hollywood-style helicopter jailbreak, Pascal Payet has been the subject of a number of TV Show and articles. His latest feat was showcased on the Netflix original White Rabbit Project \\"Jailbreak\\" episode, where TV Host Grant Imahara narrates the story in the middle of the reenactment, where Payet is portrayed by French actor Thierry Brouard.  World Record  Pascal Payet holds the record for planning the most number of escapes by helicopter.

American Le Mans Series (ALMS) race at Mid Ohio in 2002. The Panoz LMP-1 Roadster-S (sometimes referred to as simply the Panoz LMP-1) was a Le Mans Prototype built for Panoz in 1999. The car was a successor to the Esperante GTR-1 which had competed in the Grand Tourer categories internationally. Following competition in the American Le Mans Series and at the 24 Hours of Le Mans until 2001, the car was replaced by the Panoz LMP07. The LMP07 would however be abandoned by Panoz and so the LMP-1 Roadster-S was reworked into a new car known as the Panoz LMP01 Evo before being retired at the end of 2003. The LMP-1 Roadster-S and LMP01 Evo are notable amongst Le Mans prototypes for their use of engines are located in front of the driver, instead of the normal positioning behind. This gave the cars a unique look compared to their competitors. Development At the end of 1998, both the FIA GT Championship and United States Road Racing Championship eliminated the GT1 category that the Esperante GTR-1 had competed in since its introduction in 1997. This left the Esperante GTR-1s with nowhere to compete unless they were modified into a Le Mans Prototype, similar to what was done with some Porsche 911 GT1s. However Panoz decided that an all-new car would be more competitive against the newcoming Audi and BMW prototypes in the American Le Mans Series, a new championship founded by Panoz. Retaining Reynard Motorsport as a designer, the LMP-1 Roadster-S would retain many styling cues from the Esperante GTR-1, mostly due to the continued usage of the front-engine layout. Although other GT-based cars like the Esperante GTR-1 had used front-engine layouts, it was uncommon for a purpose-built prototype. However Panoz insisted that the LMP-1 Roadster-S would attempt to keep this layout. From a design standpoint, the LMP-1 Roadster-S shares much with the Esperante GTR-1. Both cars have nearly identical front ends, with narrow fenders surrounding deep valleys with a rounded nose which housed the engine. A NACA duct would feed the air intake for the engine, while the deep valleys on the side that shrouded the front suspension would lead directly to the radiators which were situated in front of the cockpit. The sides of the car would be carved at various angles, giving an indented look in comparison to the fenders, assisting in allowing air to exit from various areas on the car. The cockpit situated behind the engine and just ahead of the rear axle would be small, with a single rollhoop immediately behind the driver with only the driver's side protection and rear headrest appearing from the mostly flat top of the car. The rear overhang would be short, leaving the rear wing struts actually attached to the rear diffuser behind the bodywork. For a drivetrain, Panoz would retain the √âlan Power Products 6L8 6.0 litre V8, although this engine would be branded as a Ford at times. X-Trac would provide the six-speed sequential gearbox. =LMP01 Evo= Following the failure of the LMP07 to perform as planned, Panoz decided that it would be better to return to the LMP-1 Roadster-S that the company understood and knew could perform as promised. However the car needed upgrades in order to remain competitive with the continually updated Audi R8 that dominated the American Le Mans Series. Panoz began by modifying the front of the car to become much more narrow in the fenders and the center nose. All three now came more to a singular point at the front of the car, instead of the rounded design used before. The brake cooling ducts in the nose of the car were also made larger, with the raised nose's tip being moved upward. The air intakes on either side of the nose were also slightly revised by bringing their top edge forward. The side air exhaust vents were on the other hand made larger, with only a small compliance panel being used behind the front wheel well. The rear bodywork was also extended, now enveloping the rear wing mounts. The mounts themselves were also brought closer together in a fashion similar to that seen on other prototypes. Racing history The Panoz LMP-1 Roadster-S would make its debut at the second race of the inaugural American Le Mans Series season in 1999. Backed by title sponsor Visteon, only one car was available in time, leading Panoz to use an older Esperante GTR-1 modified for the LMP class. However, the LMP-1 Roadster-S would perform well on its debut, taking fifth place a mere lap behind the race winner. The second chassis was completed after this race in time for the team to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Both cars finished in their endurance debut, taking seventh and eleventh places behind BMW, Audi, and Toyota. On returning to the ALMS for Mosport, both cars were able to overcome the older Riley & Scott-Fords, Ferrari 333 SPs, and withdrawn BMW V12 LMRs to take first and second place. The next round would see the BMW V12 LMR retake the top position, although the two Panozes completed the podium. Both Panozes would again take the podium and win at Portland, before the Petit Le Mans endurance event. A third LMP-1 Roadster-S was now completed, being sold to J&P; Motorsport, allowing for all three cars to finish the race. With the one factory car taking the overall win over BMW, the second would take fifth and the J&P; Motorsport entry eleventh. The two factory Panozes would finish out the season without another victory, but their achievements allowed Panoz to take the LMP teams championship by a mere two points over BMW. For 2000, one former factory LMP-1 was sold to the Danish Team Den Bl√• Avis for competition in the Sports Racing World Cup, while two new cars would be built for the factory team in the American Le Mans Series. The season did not begin well for the factory however, as neither car managed to finish the 12 Hours of Sebring. The cars would rebound at Charlotte to finish second and fifth before the series traveled to its new European rounds. Silverstone would once again see a second-place finish behind a BMW before the factory team headed to the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At Le Mans, the two factory Panozes were joined by the Den Bl√• Avis Panoz that had had a best finish of third so far in the Sports Racing World Cup. Two more LMP-1s were also there from Japanese Team Dragon, using one ex-factory car and a newly built car. All five would finish, although Den Bl√• Avis' entry would not be classified. The other four cars took fifth, sixth, eighth, and fifteenth. Before returning to the United States, the 1000km N√ºrburgring would be held for the ALMS. A Panoz LMP-1 Roadster-S would manage to take the race win over BMW, the only win that the car would manage the entire year. Panoz would not manage another podium finish in the ALMS until the seventh round, followed by another at Portland. The defending Petit Le Mans winners would once again lose to BMW by taking only third and fourth at the event, before closing out the season without another podium. Panoz would finish third in the LMP championship behind Audi and BMW, while the LMP-1 Roadster-S' successor, the LMP07, would make its debut at the season finale. In the Sports Racing World Cup, Team Den Bl√• Avis would be joined by a second LMP-1 Roadster-S for the team, yet they would not manage another podium finish the rest of the season. They too finished the season in third in their championship, behind a pair of Ferrari 333 SPs. For 2001, Panoz would start the initial race of the season with a pair of LMP-1 Roadster-S before committing fully to their new LMP07 at the next round, the 12 Hours of Sebring. This meant that the LMP-1s would be sold off to privateer teams, with most competing in the new European Le Mans Series. Westward Motorsports would be the first to compete with a customer chassis that season, taking fifth place at Donington Park ahead of the two factory LMP07s. The team would not continue though, and an LMP-1 Roadster-S was soon bought by Lanesra, taking a third-place finish at Most before winning at Vallelunga. However, by this time Panoz had become frustrated with their new LMP07 following several disappointing performances, when it was decided following Le Mans that the team would bring back their LMP-1 Roadster-S. One car finished on the podium on its return debut before following this with a race win at Portland ahead of the Audi R8s. A second at Mosport was followed by another win at Mid-Ohio. However the team would suffer difficulties at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca and the Petit Le Mans, leaving them off the podiums. Panoz's combined points between the LMP07 and LMP-1 Roadster-S would earn them second in the LMP900 championship, once again behind Audi. For 2002, the redesigned LMP-01 Evo would make its debut for Panoz in the American Le Mans Series, fully replacing the abandoned LMP07s. Although they suffered at the 12 Hours of Sebring, they managed to show winning form at Sears Point. However, on return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, neither car would finish the race. An older LMP-1 Roadster-S was also run in the race as part of a camera car for Michel Valliant, yet also failed to finish. The team would later win at the temporary street course at RFK Stadium in the ALMS, before troubles with the aged cars saw Panoz fail to score a podium in any of the remaining races that season. Panoz would finish third in the LMP900 championship behind two Audi teams. The LMP01 Evos would continue into 2003, this time being run by the JML Team in place of the Panoz factory itself, yet still retained factory support. However the pace of the cars was lacking in comparison to its competitors, with a string of five third-place finishes in a row finally eclipsed by a second place at the finale at Petit Le Mans. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of JML's two entries managed to finish in fifth place behind the Audis and Bentleys. The car would officially be retired after the 2003 season, with Panoz deciding instead to concentrate on the new Esperante GT-LM production-based race car for the GT2 class in the American Le Mans Series. Chassis A total of eight LMP-1 Roadster-S and LMP01 Evos would be built in total from 1999 to 2002.

It is about a Jewish boy named Felix who lived in Poland and is on a quest to find his book-keeper parents after he sees Nazis burning the books from a Catholic orphanage in which had stayed at for 3 years and 8 months. He finds a girl, who is unconscious, called Zelda in a burning house with her dead parents‚Äîhe takes her with him and protects her from confronting her parents' death by telling her stories. Although Once is a work of fiction, Gleitzman was inspired by the story of Janusz Korczak, the events of World War II, and Hitler's attempt to exterminate the Jewish population of Europe. Once was translated into German (') and was nominated for the 2010 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis; it won the 2011 . The sequels to the book are Then (2009), Now (2010), After (2012), Soon (2015) and Maybe (2017). In chronological order of Felix's life, the books are Once, Then, After, Soon, Maybe and Now. Gleitzman has announced that the title of the final book in the series will be Always. Development Although Once is a work of fiction, Gleitzman was inspired by the story of Janusz Korczak, the events of World War II, and Hitler's attempt to exterminate the Jewish population of Europe. As research for the novel, Gleitzman read several books about and by young people in the Holocaust, including The King of Children by Betty Jean Lifton (a biography of Janusz Korczak), Salvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of The Holocaust, edited by Alexander Zapruder, The Hidden Children by Jane Marks, Words to Outlive Us: Eyewitness Accounts From the Warsaw Ghetto, edited by Micha≈Ç Grynberg, Witness: Voices From The Holocaust, edited by Joshua M.

Reception The Horn Book Guide described Once as \\"this is the rare Holocaust book for young readers that doesn't alleviate its dark themes with a comforting ending\\". The School Library Journal recommends this book as a 'read aloud' book, and notes how it contrasts \\"how children would like to imagine their world with the tragic way that life sometimes unfolds.\\" Kirkus Reviews describes Felix's misconceptions of the world \\"heartbreaking\\", and described his story as being \\"packed with sadness\\", with a tinge of hope offered by the character inspired by Janusz Korczak.

This is primarily a perceptual classification, based on whether the sounds are perceived as sharp, high intensity, or as dull, low intensity. However, it can also be defined acoustically (acute sounds have a concentration of energy in the higher spectrum, versus graves which have a concentration of energy in the lower spectrum) or in terms of the articulations involved. Acute sounds generally have high perceptual intensity, and in the case of consonants have been defined as those with an active articulation involving the tongue and a passive articulation involving anywhere on the roof of the mouth that a coronal articulation can reach, that is, from the to the region. Grave sounds are all other sounds, that is, those involving the lips as either passive or active articulator, or those involving any articulation in the soft palate or throat. Most acute sounds are , and most coronals are acute. In particular, palatal consonants are acute but not coronal, while linguolabial consonants are coronal but not acute. The distinction can be useful in diachronic linguistics, as conditional sound changes often act differently on acute and grave consonants, consonants are highly likely to preserve their acuteness/graveness through sound change; and changes between acute and grave can often be well circumscribed. (For example, palatalization applied to back grave consonants usually produces acute consonants.) In this regard, the fact that articulations are included as \\"acute\\" is important because of the acoustic similarity between true palatal and palatalized coronal consonants and the fact that one often changes into the other. Similarly, \\"acute\\" and \\"\\" often overlap, but again share some differences. In particular, consonants articulated with the lip are front but not acute, and consonants with a articulation are acute but not front. A parallel relationship applies to and . Articulations with the lip as passive articulator (i.e. and ) are front but not coronal, while is coronal but not front. In the case of vowels, \\"acute\\" typically refers to front vowels, which often trigger palatalization of consonants, which \\"grave\\" refers to non-front vowels.  Modern relevance  The grave/acute distinction has lost its relevance in modern phonetics, but it may still be relevant to other disciplines. The distinction dates from relatively early in the days of acoustic phonetics, at a time that some phonologists believed that one could categorize all speech sounds by a finite set of acoustically-defined distinctive features, which were supposed to correspond to auditory impressions of sounds. The pioneering publication was Jakobson, Fant and Halle (1951) Preliminaries to Speech Analysis (MIT). Grave/acute was defined primarily in acoustic terms (with some reference to auditory qualities), but sounds were given a secondary description (or gloss) in terms of their articulation. Features like grave/acute could be used to divide speech sounds into broad classes. For most phoneticians, the JF&H; features had been superseded by 1968 by the articulatory features set out in Chomsky and Halle‚Äôs Sound Pattern of English and by competing articulatory features, which devised by Ladefoged in such publications as Preliminaries to Linguistic Phonetics (1971).

The books do not name any author, as authorship was not considered important by the society that produced them, and it was only after Jews came into intense contact with author-centric Hellenistic culture in the late Second Temple period that the rabbis began to find authors for their scriptures. The tradition that Moses was this author probably began with the law-code of Deuteronomy, and was then gradually extended until Moses, as the central character, came to be regarded not just as the mediator of law but as author of both laws and narrative. By the 1st century CE it was already common practice to refer to the five books as the \\"Law of Moses\\", but the first unequivocal expression of the idea that this meant authorship appears in the Babylonian Talmud, an encyclopedia of Jewish tradition and scholarship composed between 200‚Äì500 CE. There the rabbis noticed and addressed such issues as how Moses had received the divine revelation, how it was curated and transmitted to later generations, and how difficult passages such as the last verses of Deuteronomy, which describe his death, were to be explained. This culminated in the 8th of Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith, establishing belief in Mosaic authorship as an article of Jewish belief. Mosaic authorship of the Torah was unquestioned by both Jews and Christians until the European Enlightenment, when the systematic study of the five books led the majority of scholars to conclude that they are the product of many hands and many centuries. Despite this, the role of Moses is an article of faith in traditional Jewish circles and for some Christian Evangelical scholars, for whom it remains crucial to their understanding of the unity and authority of Scripture.  Torah, authorship, and the development of the tradition  The Torah (or Pentateuch, as biblical scholars sometimes call it) is the collective name for the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.Orthodox Jews believe that God also revealed an oral Torah to Moses, but this article deals only with the written Torah, the first five books of the Bible. It forms the charter myth of Israel, the story of the people's origins and the foundations of their culture and institutions, and it is a fundamental principle of Judaism that the relationship between God and his chosen people was set out on Mount Sinai through the Torah. The development of the Torah began by around 600 BCE when previously unconnected material began to be drawn together; by around 400 BCE these books, the fore-runners of the Torah, had reached their modern form and began to be recognised as complete, unchangeable, and sacred; and by around 200 BCE the five books were accepted as the first section of the Jewish canon.The Jewish canon is made up of three parts, the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings. It seems that the tradition of Mosaic authorship was first applied to Deuteronomy, which scholars generally agree was composed in Jerusalem during the reform program of King Josiah in the late 7th century BCE; it is this law-code that books such as Joshua and Kings (completed in the mid 500s) mean when they speak of the \\"torah of Moses.\\" In later books such as Chronicles and Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah the meaning had expanded to include the other laws such as Leviticus, and by Hellenistic times Jewish writers referred to the entirety of the five books, narrative and laws, as the Book (or books) of Moses. Authorship was not considered important by the society that produced the Hebrew Bible (the Protestant Old Testament), and the Torah never names an author. It was only after c. 300 BCE, when Jews came into intense contact with author-centric Greek culture, that the rabbis began to feel compelled to find authors for their books,The earliest Jewish text to identify its author is the Book of Sirach, dating from the early 2nd century BCE - pronouncements such as \\"These are the prophecies of Isaiah\\" identify bodies of tradition rather than authors. See Schniedewind, p.7‚Äì10. and the process which led to Moses becoming identified as the author of the Torah may have been influenced by three factors: first, by a number of passages in which he is said to write something, frequently at the command of God, although these passages never appear to apply to the entire five books; second, by his key role in four of the five books (Genesis is the exception); and finally, by the way in which his authority as lawgiver and liberator of Israel united the story and laws of the Pentateuch.See McEntire, 2008, pp.8‚Äì9, for some of the passages in which Moses is said to write (this list is not exhaustive): * : God commands Moses: \\"Write this, a remembrance...\\" The context indicates that God is commanding Moses to record Joshua's battle with Amalek described in Exodus 7:8‚Äì13. * : \\"Moses wrote all the words of the Lord.\\" This apparently refers to the laws which God has just given in Exodus 20:21‚Äì23:33. * : Moses \\"wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant, ten words.\\" The identity of these \\"ten words\\" is not made clear, but probably is a reference to the Ten Commandments given several chapters previously, in Exodus 20. * : \\"Here are the stages in the journey of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt ... at the Lord's command Moses recorded the stages in their journey; this is their journey by stages:\\" There follows a list of the places where the Israelites camped in the wilderness. * : \\"Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, the ones carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord\\" and Deuteronomy 31:24: \\"Moses ... finished writing the words of this law on a scroll.\\" It is not clear just what Moses wrote, but it is usually taken to be the collection of laws that make up Deuteronomy 5‚Äì30. *: \\"Moses wrote down this song on that day.\\" The \\"song\\" is presumably Deuteronomy 32, the Song of Moses. Mosaic authorship in rabbinic tradition to the modern period The Babylonian Talmud, an encyclopedia of Jewish scholarship composed between 200‚Äì500 CE, states that \\"Moses wrote his own book and the section concerning Balaam.\\"The episode of Balaam, found in the Book of Numbers, tells how the Canaanite prophet Balaam was asked by Israel's enemies to curse Israel, but blessed them instead. The medieval sage Maimonides (c.1135‚Äì1204) enshrined this in his Thirteen Principles of Faith (a summary of the required beliefs of Judaism), the 8th of which states: \\"I believe with perfect faith that the entire Torah presently in our possession is the one given to Moses.\\" The rabbis explained that God wrote the Torah in heaven before the world was created, in letters of black fire on parchment of white fire, and that Moses received it by divine dictation, writing the exact words spoken to him by God. The rabbis also explained how the Torah was handed down to later generations: \\"Moses received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua, Joshua to the Elders, the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the men of the Great Assembly,\\" who in turn transmitted it to the rabbis. (The Great Assembly, according to Jewish tradition, was called by Ezra to ensure the accurate transmission of the Torah of Moses when the Jews returned from exile). Orthodox rabbis therefore say that thanks to this chain of custodians the Torah of today is identical with that received by Moses, not varying by a single letter. The rabbis were aware that some phrases in the Torah do not seem to fit with divine dictation of a pre-existent text, and this awareness accounts for a second tradition of how the divine word was transmitted: God spoke and Moses remembered the divine words and wrote them down afterwards, together with some explanatory phrases of his own. This explanation is a minority one, but it explains, for example, why every step in the description of the construction of the Tabernacle is followed by the phrase, \\"As the Lord commanded Moses.\\" There were also passages which seemed impossible for Moses to have written, notably the account of his own death and burial in last verses of Deuteronomy: the Talmud's answer is that \\"Joshua wrote ... [the last] eight verses of the Torah,\\" yet this implied that the Torah was incomplete when Moses handed it to Israel; the explanation of the rabbis was that the verses were indeed by Moses, but written \\"with tears in his eyes\\" as God dictated to him this description of his end. More serious were a few passages which implied an author long after the time of Moses, such as Genesis 12:6, \\"The Canaanite was then in the land,\\" implying a time when the Canaanites were no longer in the land. Abraham ibn Ezra (c.1092‚Äì1167) made a celebrated comment on this phrase, writing that it contains \\"a great secret, and the person who understands it will keep quiet;\\" the 14th century rabbi Joseph ben Samuel Bonfils responded that Moses had written this and similar passages, as he was a prophet, but that it made no difference whether they were by him or some later prophet, \\"since the words of all of them are true and inspired.\\" Finally, there were a few passages which implied that Moses had used pre-existing sources: a section of the Book of Numbers (Numbers 10:35‚Äì36) is surrounded in the Hebrew by inverted nuns (the equivalent of brackets) which the rabbis said indicated that these verses were from a separate book, the Book of Eldad and Medad.Eldad and Medad prophesied among the Israelites despite not having received the gift of prophesy from God. Biblical scholars today agree almost unanimously that the Torah is the work of many authors over many centuries. A major factor in this rejection of the tradition of Mosaic authorship was the development of the documentary hypothesis, which understood the Pentateuch as a composite work made up of four \\"sources,\\" or documents, compiled over centuries in a process that was not concluded until long after Moses' death. The documentary hypothesis aroused understandable opposition from traditional scholars. One of the most significant was David Zvi Hoffmann (1843‚Äì1921), who attempted to defend Mosaic authorship by demonstrating that the sources identified by the documentary hypothesis were, in fact, pre-exilic; if this were proven, he believed, then the hypothesis itself was dis-proven. The most he would concede to the proponents of the hypothesis was that Moses may have written various scrolls over his career and that these may have been collated and united before his death. Another important Jewish scholar, and one still active, is David Weiss Halivni (b.1927): he has developed a theory of Chate'u Yisrael, literally, \\"Israel has sinned\\", which states that the originally monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours and neglected the Torah of Moses, with the result that it became \\"blemished and maculated;\\" only on the return from Babylon did the people once again accept the Torah, which was then recompiled and edited by Ezra as evidenced in Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah and Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah. He further states that while the text of the Torah was corrupted, oral tradition was preserved intact, which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details. Menachem Mendel Kasher (1895‚Äì1983), taking a different approach, accepted the documentary hypothesis but adapted it to the Mosaic tradition, pointing to certain traditions of the Oral Torah which show Moses quoting Genesis prior to the epiphany at Sinai; based on a number of Bible verses and rabbinic statements, he therefore suggested that Moses made use of documents authored by the Patriarchs when redacting that book. This view is supported by some rabbinical sources and medieval commentaries which recognize that the Torah incorporates written texts and divine messages from before and after the time of Moses. Mosaic authorship in the Christian tradition The Christian scriptures showed Jesus himself recognised Moses as the author of at least some portions of the Pentateuch (e.g., the Gospel of John, verses 5:46‚Äì47), and the early Christians therefore followed the rabbis. Like them, they addressed those passages which seemed to cast doubt on the Mosaic tradition: Saint Jerome, for example, felt that \\"unto this day\\" implied an author long after the time of Moses, presumably the 5th century BCE sage Ezra. Martin Luther similarly concluded that the description of Moses' death was by Joshua ‚Äì but believed that the question itself was of no great importance. Jerome and Luther and others still believed that the bulk of the Pentateuch was by Moses, even if a few phrases were not, but in the 17th century scholars began to seriously question its origins, leading Benedict Spinoza to declare that \\"the Pentateuch was not written by Moses but by someone else.\\" This conclusion had major implications, for as the 18th century Jewish scholar David Levi pointed out to his Christian colleagues, \\"if any part [of the Torah] is once proved spurious, a door will be opened for another and another without end.\\" As David Levi had feared, the questioning of Mosaic authorship had led to a profound skepticism towards the very idea of revealed religion, and by the late 19th century scholars almost universally accepted that the Book of Deuteronomy dated not from the time of Moses but from the 7th century BCE, with the Pentateuch as a whole being compiled by unknown editors from various originally distinct source-documents. Gradually the various Christian churches came to accept these conclusions. In 1943, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu which encouraged scholars to investigate the sacred texts utilizing such resources as recent discoveries in archeology, ancient history, linguistics, and other technical methods. On January 16, 1948, Cardinal Suhard, secretary of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, responded to a question about the origin of the Pentateuch: Christian support for Mosaic authorship is now limited largely to conservative Evangelical circles. This is tied to the way Evangelicals view the unity and authority of scripture: in the words of the Zondervan Encyclopedia of the Bible, \\"Faith in Christ and faith in the books of the OT canon stand or fall together [because] Christ and the apostles ... took the Pentateuch as Mosaic [and] put their seal on it as Holy Scripture.\\" Nevertheless, the majority of contemporary Evangelicals, while accepting that some or much of the Pentateuch can be traced to Moses or traditions about him, pay little attention to the question of authorship.

Originally published in 1984, the book consistently tops The New York Times Best Seller list in the paperback advice category, is one of USA Todays \\"25 Most Influential Books\\" of the past 25 years and has been described as \\"the bible of American pregnancy\\". , over 14.5 million copies were in print. According to USA Today, 93 percent of all expectant mothers who read a pregnancy guide read What to Expect When You're Expecting. In 2012, What to Expect When You're Expecting was adapted into a film released by Lionsgate. Format The book presents advice in a question-and-answer format. It proceeds chronologically from the time a woman first begins to suspect pregnancy, through each of the nine months (with one chapter devoted to each), and into the postpartum period. The beginning of each chapter succinctly lists common physical and emotional changes and symptoms a woman may be experiencing, and gives information on what a woman can expect when visiting her doctor or nurse midwife during checkups. Also included early in each chapter is a section entitled \\"A Look Inside\\" which displays pictures of the changing female anatomy and the growing embryo then fetus. Additional information in sections titled \\"What You May Be Concerned About\\" and \\"What It's Important to Know\\" is designed to address a wide range of concerns, problems and life trends. Each edition includes substantial nutrition information discussing caloric intake, maintaining balanced meals and provides sample recipes. Recent editions include a complete nutrition plan. The book's appendix lists additional sources of information and resources including government organizations, associations and foundations. Origin of the book Author Heidi Murkoff cites her own quest for reassuring information during her first pregnancy as being the motivation for developing What to Expect When You're Expecting. Murkoff collaborated with her mother Arlene Eisenberg, a freelance journalist and her sister Sandee Hathway, a nurse when developing the pregnancy guide.\\"About the Author Heidi Murkoff\\" Its iconic title emerged when an employee of the publisher suggested it as a subtitle for the temporarily titled manuscript, \\"Pregnancy:\\" By publication, the subtitle had claimed the top spot. Although the book's initial print run was small, word of mouth and innovative promotion led to sales that increased in every subsequent year. Controversy What to Expect When You're Expecting has been criticized for promoting paranoia and fear among pregnant women for focusing on complications and for its extremely strict dietary guidelines. Murkoff also has no medical training and has been further criticized for stating she asks obstetricians to comment on manuscripts only late in the writing and editing processes. With the first publishing of the book being in 1984, one reason it is considered problematic is due to the many old and unrevised printings in public circulation. Although wording is revised with each new edition to respond to critiques, older copies are passed down by women to their pregnant peers. The Science Based Medicine blog criticised the book for its recommendations of Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM), such as Acupuncture, Reflexology, Aromatherapy and Homeopathy. The blog post concludes: > There is no credible scientific evidence to support any of these > recommendations. It could be argued that this is all feel-good, ‚Äúkeep-the- > patient entertained‚Äù advice with little chance of direct harm. But it is > deceptive and dishonest to represent these modalities as effective > treatments based on science, especially in a book that is otherwise > scientifically reliable.

The Foundation reports that millions of impoverished women do not have access to free comprehensive pregnancy guides which led to the development of \\"Baby Basics\\" a book and education program delivering prenatal health literacy. Film adaptation Even though the book does not contain a storyline, Lionsgate adapted What to Expect When You're Expecting into a film of the same name directed by Kirk Jones. It features an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks, Anna Kendrick, Chris Rock, Brooklyn Decker, Rodrigo Santoro, Rob Huebel, Chace Crawford and Matthew Morrison.

Three of the four are located on heritage properties in different neighbourhoods within the city, and the fourth is located in a library facility. Anderson Farm Museum Anderson Farm Museum logo. The Anderson Farm Museum is located on a site in Lively, on a historic dairy farm once owned by Finnish immigrants Frank Anderson and Gretta Anderson (Peltoniemi). The museum incorporates many of the original farm buildings, as well as the historic paymaster's cabin from Inco's mining facilities in Creighton, which was moved to the Anderson Farm site after the community was shut down in 1987. Copper Cliff Museum Copper Cliff Museum logo The Copper Cliff Museum on Balsam Street in Copper Cliff is housed in a log cabin on the site of the very first homestead in the community. The log cabin is not the original structure on that property, however, but was moved there in 1972. The museum is set up to depict the lifestyle of a miner's family in the area. The museum also has the baseball jacket of Thelma Jo Walmsley, a Copper Cliff native who played on the Racine Belles' 1946 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League championship team. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the Mine Rescue Stations's role in Ontario's heritage.Ontario Plaque The Flour Mill Flour Mill Museum Flour Mill Museum logo. The Flour Mill Museum (Mus√©e du Moulin-√†-Fleur) was initially located on Notre-Dame Avenue beside the Flour Mill Silos in the city's historic Flour Mill neighbourhood. It was later moved in the 1980s to its present location on St. Charles Street. The historic building was originally the home of Fran√ßois Varieur, the foreman of an early lumber mill in the Sudbury area. It was later acquired by the Manitoba and Ontario Flour Mill Company, to serve as the home of the community's flour mill foreman. The museum was opened in 1974, and is devoted particularly to the life and history of the Franco-Ontarian community in the Flour Mill area. Rayside-Balfour Museum Rayside-Balfour Museum logo. The Rayside-Balfour Museum located in Azilda, is the smallest of the four museums. Located in the community library branch, it incorporates several small exhibits depicting historical agricultural lifestyles in the Sudbury Basin area. Re-Branding Project In 2015 the museums' undertook a re-branding project. This involved employing a local graphic design firm (Design de Plume) to create and design new logos for each heritage site and a main logo for the Greater Sudbury Museums. The inspiration for the logos stems from the idea that Greater Sudbury is a patchwork community that combines cultural aspects from the nearby settlements of the area. The re-branding was centered around this concept, as well as their motto \\"cultural mosaic\\", to highlight each settlement's unique history as it comes together to form the Greater City of Sudbury. The cultural mosaic concept took inspiration from the unifying quilt by Mrs. Carolyn Wahamaa, who created imagery that \\"[symbolized] the harmony existing in the towns of Rayside-Balfour, Azilda and Chelmsford, as well as between Anglophone and Francophone residents, with each party maintaining its own identity\\". Online resources The museums' website incorporates some video and photographic exhibits, as well as quite a bit of historical writing on the region and its distinct communities (in its Greater Sudbury Histories section). In addition to the website, the museums offer a number of online resources, including: * The INCO Triangle Digital Archives: A digital version of the INCO Triangle, a monthly publication produced by the International Nickel Company for its employees between the years of 1936 and 1998. * Copper Cliff at War: An online exhibition about the former town of Copper Cliff from its beginnings until the end of World War II. This online exhibition was produced by the Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums through the Community Memories Program for the Virtual Museum of Canada. * The Greater Sudbury Historical Database: This database was produced in partnership with the Greater Sudbury Public Library. While somewhat difficult to search, this database contains thousands of photographs and references to the Main Library's large microfilm and historical vertical file collection. It is best searched with simple keywords and multiple searches under each of the \\"Title\\", \\"Subject\\" and \\"Keyword\\" search options. * Greater Sudbury Memories: This project was designed by the Greater Sudbury Public Library as a means of assembling, preserving and sharing Greater Sudbury's oral histories. This website presents a map of the Greater Sudbury area populated with audio and video interviews that reflect times past, allowing users to interact with real stories of life in Greater Sudbury. The Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums have provided assistance towards as of yet unpublished video interviews for this project.

Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, featuring the fictional sword and sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian created by Robert E. Howard. It was based on a draft of a story by Carter, featuring his character Thongor as the protagonist. It was originally published in the 1967 collection Conan. Plot summary Conan has joined a band of warriors from the northern country of Asgard, while taking part in a raid against the Hyperboreans living east of the region. Eventually, Conan is captured and enslaved by the ape-like Hyperboreans. However, he doesn't remain a prisoner for long. After escaping from his chains and slaying his captors, Conan makes his way south. Soon, Conan is pursued by a pack of hungry wolves. Armed only with a broken length of chain, Conan manages to fight off the starving wolves until he finds refuge near a range of hills. Inside one of the hills, he discovers the entrance to a buried crypt. After hiding within an ancient chamber, which the wolves are strangely unwilling to follow him into, Conan lights himself a fire. Suddenly, he discovers a grisly occupant. Enthroned on a square boulder of black stone is the large mummified corpse of a man, apparently a great warrior or chieftain from ancient times. Noticing an iron sword which lies across the dead man's knees, Conan steals the weapon and claims it for himself. Exulted in his new-found sense of power, Conan hears the sound of a dry creaking and turns to face the mummy as it begins rising from its throne, having been raised from the dead by Conan's warcry. It advances on the young barbarian, but Conan, though frightened of the creature, stands his ground and engages in a desperate battle against the walking corpse. Finding that the wounds he inflicts are not enough to kill an undead creature, he eventually manages to hurl the mummy into the fire, utterly destroying it. Not wanting to spend all night inside the haunted crypt, Conan emerges with his new weapon and, seeing no sign of the wolves, continues on his journey.

Grettir's objective was the treasure buried with the chieftain and, especially, a single edged seax, reputed to be a great weapon. Soon after entering the mound, the corpse of K√°r comes to life and battles Grettir.

It has been reported that immediately before his execution he had said \\"Long live the constitutional government\\" (Zendeh bƒÅd Mashrouteh) and pointed to the ground and uttered the words \\"O Land, we are [being] killed for the sake of your preservation [/protection]\\" (Ey KhƒÅk, mƒÅ barƒÅye hefz-e to koshteh shodim).Mirza Jahangir Khan Sur-e Esrafil, 19 July 2008, (7 min 11 sec). It is important to note that koshteh shodim is in the past tense and its use (by Mirza Jahangir Khan, while apparently still alive), along with his use of \\"we\\", instead of \\"I\\" (unless he had been referring to both himself and the other fellow prisoners), has a dramatic effect on the hearers who know Persian. Thus the translation \\"we are [being] killed\\" amounts to a compromise, as \\"we were killed\\" would feel odd and out of place in English. Biography MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn was born to a relatively impoverished family from Shiraz.MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir Khan's father's name is Rajab-Ali ShirƒÅzi. It has been mentioned that as a child MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir Khan was put in the care of his aunt. See: Farhang va Honar (Culture and Art) . Here the age of MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir Khan at his death is given as 34. Two further details given here are, firstly, that 32 issues of Sur-e EsrƒÅfil were published under the editorship of MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir Khan and, secondly, that after the murder of MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir Khan, Sur-e EsrƒÅfil was continued to be published by Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda and Hasan Taqizadeh outside Iran. In Ali Akbar Dehkhoda, Iran Chamber Society, one reads that: \\"While in exile [following Mohammad-Ali Shah's coup d'√©tat], first in Paris and then to [sic] Switzerland, Dehkhoda with the aid of other Iranian exiles in Paris such as Abolhassan Pirnia and Mo'azed al-Saltaneh published three additional issues of Sur-Esrafil [Sur-e Esrafil] in Yverdon, Switzerland, which according to [Abdollah] Mostofi were sent to and circulated in Iran.\\" In his youth he studied Persian literature, logic, philosophy and mathematics with the masters of these subjects in his birthplace Shiraz. He later moved to the capital city Tehran where he embarked on studying modern sciences at the √©lite school of Dar ol-Fonoon and some other centres of learning available in this city at his time. At the inception of the movement leading to the Constitutional Revolution, he joined a number of underground groups of revolutionaries and before long became one of the main pillars of the Revolution. He became a devotee of HƒÅj Sheikh HƒÅdi NajmƒÅbƒÅdi.Sur-e EsrƒÅfil (Mirza Jahangir Khan Shirazi), ibid.HƒÅj Sheikh HƒÅdi NajmƒÅbƒÅdi (ÿ≠ÿßÿ¨ ÿ¥ŸäÿÆ ŸáÿßÿØŸä ŸÜÿ¨ŸÖ ÿ¢ÿ®ÿßÿØŸä) is known to have been one of the main patrons of the Roshddieh School in Tabriz. See Mahmud Hakimi, in Pioneers of Education: Mirza Hasan Roshddieh, founder of modern schools in Iran, Jazireh Danesh (in Persian). Although it is known that MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn was an Azali B√°b√≠,Nikki R. Keddie, ibid., pp. 70, 179 and 180. we do not know whether he became a B√°b√≠ in Shiraz, the cradle of B√°bism, or in Tehran.According to Mangol Bayat (p. 43), HƒÅj Sheikh HƒÅdi NajmƒÅbƒÅdi was \\"a mojtahed [a clergyman practising religious jurisprudence] declared heretical for his alleged Azali Babist sympathies.\\" It seems therefore very likely that MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir Khan became a B√°b√≠ in Tehran where HƒÅj Sheikh HƒÅdi NajmƒÅbƒÅdi gave private and informal lectures at the time. Mangol Bayat, Iran‚Äôs First Revolution: Shi‚Äôism and the Constitutional Revolution of 1905‚Äì1909, Studies in Middle Eastern History, 336 p. (Oxford University Press, 1991). GhƒÅsem Sur-e EsrƒÅfil Through part of the legislative period of the First Majles, MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn published the Sur-e EsrƒÅfil weekly newspaperMirza Jahangir Khan-e Sur-Esraafil [sic] (in Persian), Rozaneh Magazine (September - October 2003) . Here the age of MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn at the time of his death is indicated as having been 32, implying that he must have been born in 1875 or 1876. The same text provides two further relevant pieces of information, namely that, firstly, MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn had had the opportunity to take refuge in the compound belonging to the British Legation in Tehran, however he had expressly rejected to use this option, and secondly, MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn's execution was effected through strangling and stabbing in his heart: first two executioners affixed two separate ropes to his neck and pulled these in opposite directions until blood flew from his mouth, upon which a third executioner stabbed him is his heart. as its Editor, receiving financial backing for this enterprise from GhƒÅsem Sur-e EsrƒÅfil (ŸÇÿßÿ≥ŸÖ ÿµŸàÿ± ÿßÿ≥ÿ±ÿßŸÅŸäŸÑ), son of MirzƒÅ Hasan KhƒÅn Tabrizi. The first edition of Sur-e EsrƒÅfil was published on Thursday 30 May 1907 (8 KhordƒÅd 1286 AH); one year and six days later, on Thursday 4 June 1908 (14 KhordƒÅd 1287 AH), MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn was arrested and executed.Mirza Jahangir Khan-e Sur-Esraafil [sic] (in Persian), Rozaneh Magazine, ibid. The circulation of Sur-e EsrƒÅfil is said to have been approximately 20,000;Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda, Persian Language & Literature, Iran Chamber Society.The writer of these lines has encountered a single document that indicates that the Sur-e EsrƒÅfil newspaper was printed in Shiraz. This information needs to be verified since it appears very unlikely to be correct, in view of the fact that at the time both the Editor and the main contributors to this newspaper were residents of Tehran; Shiraz is located south of Tehran and given the state of the public transportation of hundred years ago, one can have serious doubts as to whether it could have been feasible to print a weekly newspaper at such a distance from its Editor. the number of printed copies of this newspaper has been as high as 24,000.A.-A. Sa'ƒ´dƒ´ SirjƒÅni, DehkhodƒÅ, Encyclopaedia Iranica, . It was during this period that he overtly attacked the deposed Mohammad Ali Shah, a fact that did not pass unnoticed either by the latter or by his own devoted following, making him by equal measures both hated and loved. One of the most celebrated literary figures of the time who contributed to Sur-e EsrƒÅfil was Ali-Akbar DehkhodƒÅ. His satirical political column, named Charand o Parand (Balderdash and Piffle)DehkhodƒÅ's Charand o Parands have been collected and published in book format; see: Charand o Parand (in Persian) by Ali-Akbar DehkhodƒÅ (Afrasiyab, Tehran, 2002) - .

The radical preachers Jamal ad-Din Esfahani (caught while trying to flee), Malek al-Motakallemin and the editor of Sur-e EsrƒÅfil, Mirza Jahangir Khan (the last two had Azali B√°b√≠ ties), were among those killed.

Jamal ad-Din Esfahani Sayyed Jamal-al-Din Esfahani is the father of the celebrated Iranian writer Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh. MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn, together with some deputies who had taken refuge inside the Majles compound, escaped through an opening in the siege and took refuge to the house of MirzƒÅ Mohsen KhƒÅn Amin ad-Dauleh.The individuals who together with MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn escaped, through an opening in the wall of the seat of Majles, to the Amin ad-Dauleh Park (Ÿæÿßÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÖŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿØŸàŸÑŸá), were the following: [Sayyed Abdollah] BehbahƒÅni (ÿ®Ÿáÿ®ŸáÿßŸÜŸâ), [Sayyed Mohammad] TabƒÅtabƒÅ'i (ÿ∑ÿ®ÿßÿ∑ÿ®ÿßŸäŸâ) [father of SƒÅdeq TabƒÅtabƒÅ'i, Editor of Ruz'nƒÅmeh-ye Majles (The Majles Newspaper)], [?] Khoi (ÿÆŸàŸäŸâ), [?] Hakim ol-Molk (ÿ≠ŸÉŸäŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑŸÉ), [?] MostashƒÅr ad-Dauleh (ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÑÿØŸàŸÑŸá), [?] MomtƒÅz ad-Dauleh (ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ÿßŸÑÿØŸàŸÑŸá), [?] BahƒÅ ol-VƒÅ'ezin (ÿ®ŸáÿßÿßŸÑŸàÿßÿπÿ∏ŸäŸÜ), [?] QƒÅzi Qazvini (ŸÇÿßÿ∂Ÿâ ŸÇÿ≤ŸàŸäŸÜŸâ), Haj MirzƒÅ Ebrahim ƒÄghƒÅ (ÿ≠ÿßÿ¨ ŸÖŸäÿ±ÿ≤ÿß ÿßÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸáŸäŸÖ ÿ¢ŸÇÿß), Davood KhƒÅn AliƒÅbƒÅdi (ÿØÿßŸàŸàÿØÿÆÿßŸÜ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ¢ÿ®ÿßÿØŸâ), Ali-Akbar ArdƒÅghi (ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÉÿ®ÿ± ÿßÿ±ÿØÿßŸÇŸâ), and Malek al-Motakallemin (ŸÖŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ŸÉŸÑŸÖŸäŸÜ) [father of Mehdi Malekzadeh, the historian of the Constitutional Revolution]. See Sur-e EsrƒÅfil (Mirza Jahangir Khan Shirazi), ibid. MirzƒÅ Mohsen KhƒÅn Amin ad- Dauleh (Amin ad-Dauleh II) is the son of MirzƒÅ Ali KhƒÅn Amin ad-Dauleh, the liberal and reformist Chief Minister of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah during 1897-1898, and the father of the future Prime Minister of Iran Dr Ali Amini. MirzƒÅ Mohsen KhƒÅn Amin ad-Dauleh was married to Fakhr ad-Dauleh, Princess Ashraf, daughter of Mozaffar al-Din Shah and Hazrat-e Oliah. Hazrat-e Oliah is the sister of Najm al-Saltaneh, mother of Iran's other future Prime Minister Dr Mohammad Mossadeq. MirzƒÅ Mohsen KhƒÅn had a brief spell in government as minister of Post and Telegraph. For the genealogical details see: Shajareh-nameh Project: Amini-Qajar. Amin ad-Dauleh gave refuge to [Sayyed Abdollah] BehbahƒÅni Sayyed Abdullah Behbahani (later, in 1910, to be assassinated for his pro-British activities), [Sayyed Mohammad] Tabataba'i and some others, however declined to give sanctuary to MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn, Malek al-Motakallemin and two or three of other escapees. It is not known why Amin ad-Dauleh should have withheld vital support from these men, however both MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn and Malek al- Motakallemin were B√°b√≠s and thus apostates in the eyes of many of their contemporaries. It is however conceivable that Amin al-Daouleh may have deemed that giving sanctuary to these men would prove fatal to his own life, given the fact that Mohammad-Ali Shah had come to consider in particular Malek al- Motakallemin as \\"among the most dangerous of his enemies.\\"\\"In Tehran, the two [Malek al-Motakallemin and Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani] became major preachers of the revolutionary and constitutional cause, explaining it in familiar Muslim terms emphasizing such Islamic concepts, particularly central in Shi'ism, as Justice and Oppression. Mohammad-Ali Shah considered them among the most dangerous of his enemies and had them both killed in 1908, as he did the editor of Sur-e EsrƒÅfil, MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn, also of B√°b√≠ background.\\" Nikki R. Keddie, ibid., pp. 179 and 180. Be it as it may, it has been reported that Amin ad-Dauleh not only declined to provide these men with sanctuary, but that he subsequently contacted BƒÅgh-e ShƒÅh, by telephone, and betrayed both, following which Shah's soldiers arrested these men and executed them in BƒÅgh-e ShƒÅh in the presence of Mohammad-Ali Shah himself. Some mistreated and shackled prisoners held in BƒÅgh-e ShƒÅh, arrested following the successful coup d'√©tat of Mohammad-Ali Shah. The left-most person standing (marked by 1) is QƒÅzi Qazvini, a Judge, who escaped from the Majles compound together with MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn, Malek al-Motakallemin and some other Deputies. The person standing next to him is SoltƒÅn ol-OlamƒÅ', Editor of Ruh ol-Qods (The Holy Spirit) newspaper. The eighth person standing is MirzƒÅ Mohammad-Ali KhƒÅn, Editor of Taraqqi (Progress) newspaper. The right-most person standing (marked by 13) is named as \\"MirzƒÅ Mohammad-Ali, son of HƒÅji Malek al-Motakallemin\\". Later developments MirzƒÅ Nasr'ollah Beheshti, known as Malek al- Motakallemin (King of Orators). Following the executions of MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn and Malek al-Motakallemin, Mohammad-Ali Shah's Cossacks abandoned their bodies in a moat outside the walls of BƒÅgh-e ShƒÅh. On this news reaching their friends, at night-time they buried the bodies of these men in the same or a nearby location. Following the overthrow of Mohammad-Ali Shah Qajar, these burials received some measure of official recognition and the graves were marked by stones engraved by the names of the men.Ne'mat Ahmadi, Let us prevent destruction of the burials of Sur-e EsrƒÅfil and Malek al-Motakallemin, in Persian, ƒÄftƒÅb, Saturday, April 21, 2007. With the extension of Tehran, this part of the city later became a residential area and the family of Malek al-Motakallemin built a house whose walls enclosed the graves; it became the residential home of one of Malek al-Motakallemin's sons, Asado'llah Malek- ZƒÅdeh. This house is now adjacent to Loqman od-Dauleh Adham General Hospital on KamƒÅli Street.The address of this house is: KamƒÅli Street, Makhsus Street, Shahid Ebrahimi Avenue. Shadid Ebrahimi Avenue is a cul-de-sac and the Malek- ZƒÅdeh house is identified as the last house on the left (satellite photograph of the location - move the arrow around the location marked by \\"+\\"). See: Ne'mat Ahmadi, ibid. The planned enlargement of this hospital foresees absorption of this house into the hospital; the parking area of the hospital has been named as a possible location of which the grounds of this house may become a part.Ne'mat Ahmadi, ibid. The extant family of Malek al-Motakallemin have expressed their willingness to provide for the funds necessary for the preservation of the graves. The neglect by the National Heritage Ministry of this historical house, leading to the planned extension of Loqman od-Dauleh Adham General Hospital into the grounds of this house reaching such an advanced stage, is most regrettable; one is painfully reminded of the construction of the Sivand Dam and the inundation of the Bolaghi Gorge. MirzƒÅ JahƒÅngir KhƒÅn A statue of Malek al-Motakallemin  made by the same artist, Abol-Hasan Khan Sadiqi, and from the same material and in the same dimensions as the statue of Ferdowsi (see Tehran's Ferdowsi Square) was during the Pahlavi r√©gime removed from the Hasan Abad Square (after the Iranian Revolution of 1979 renamed \\"31 Shah'rivar Square\\") and put in the care of Parks Authorities who stored it inside the headquarters of the organisation; it is believed that the Palace was opposed to the public display of this statue. In 1999 this statue was transferred from this location to a storehouse of The City Park (Park-e Shahr) of Tehran. In April 2006, this statue was declared as missing and this remains the case to this date. It is ironic that while subsequent to the Iranian Revolution it was decided to erect Malek al- Motakallemin's statue at his graveside, not only has this statue in the meantime gone missing, but also, as it stands, the very continuation of the existence of this graveside into future seems now more uncertain than ever before.

Destroy All Humans! is available for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, Destroy All Humans! 2 is available for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed is available for the Wii game console, and Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon is available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 game consoles (in Australia and Europe). The first game has been ported to PS4 being upscaled to 1080p, along with Destroy All Humans! 2. The two main protagonists of the series are voiced by J. Grant Albrecht and Richard Steven Horvitz, with the exception of the game Big Willy Unleashed, in which actors Sean Donnellan and Darryl Kurylo portray the characters. The musical score for the series is performed by composer Garry Schyman. Setting The games take place mostly on Earth where the Furon Cryptosporidium, also known as Crypto, is tasked by his superiors to gather Furon DNA locked inside human brain stems in order to save his race from cloning themselves to extinction. In Destroy All Humans!, Crypto's objectives also include investigating what happened to his previous clone. Destroy All Humans! 2 features Crypto hunting for revenge, after the KGB try to assassinate him and successfully destroy the mothership and his mission officer, Orthopox, as well as exterminating the Furons' enemy from the Martian War, the Blisk. Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed involves Crypto protecting Pox's new fast food chain using a giant robot mech disguised as the restaurant's mascot, called \\"Big Willy\\". Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon is available on Xbox 360 (and PlayStation 3 only in Australia and Europe), and involves Crypto seeking enlightenment to help him stop a conspiracy that threatens the Furon empire. Destroy All Humans! takes place in 1959; Destroy All Humans! 2 takes place in 1969; Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed takes place in 1975; Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon takes place in 1979. Games =Destroy All Humans! (2005)= In 1959, Cryptosporidium 137 first arrived on Earth to investigate the planet and search for his predecessor clone, Cryptosporidium 136, who disappeared in 1947 after Orthopox 13 sent him to Earth on a similar mission. Pox sends Crypto on a mission to harvest human brain stems (which contain a small amount of pure Furon DNA due to an encounter between Furon warriors and humans in ancient times) to prevent his species from going extinct. To accomplish his mission, he must defeat Majestic, a shadowy government organization led by a black-clad figure named Silhouette. After accomplishing this, Crypto takes over the United States by posing as the President. =Destroy All Humans! 2= Ten years have gone by since Crypto defeated Majestic and took over the American government. Orthropox 13 has died after a Soviet nuclear missile destroyed the Furon mothership. Pox has downloaded his consciousness into a personal holographic projector designed to communicate between Furons on Motherships and planet surfaces. Pox's unit, dubbed a HoloPox, allows him to communicate with, advise, and vex Crypto down on Earth. Crypto 137 has died of unknown causes, but appears in Big Willy Unleashed and Crypto 138, a clone with pure Furon DNA harvested from human brains, has taken his place as the President. Crypto 138 is the first Furon in millennia to possess genitalia, as his pure DNA has not been corrupted by radiation. When the KGB destroy the mothership and Pox, Crypto must find a way to stop them from destroying what he has worked so hard on to achieve. Along the way, he is supported by Natalya Ivanova, a rogue KGB agent whom he constantly hits on. He also comes across the Blisk, the dreaded enemy that the Furons thought they defeated in the Martian War. =Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed= Big Willy Unleashed takes place after Destroy All Humans! 2. Crypto and Pox start a fast food restaurant that serves human meat from all the people Crypto has killed harvesting more Furon DNA. Later, their rival restaurant, Colonel Kluckin' (a parody of Colonel Sanders), discovers their secret, whereupon Crypto must protect the restaurant with the Big Willy mascot mech. =Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon= Using the money earned from the Big Willy fast food franchise that Orthopox started in Big Willy Unleashed, Pox and his destructive Furon warrior minion Crypto have opened a \\"family friendly\\" casino with which they use to obtain a steady financial income and human DNA. Crypto has lost his motivation because of the death of Natalya, and has forgotten what it means to destroy humans. He drinks too much alcohol, watches too much television, and has ultimately become lazy. Later Crypto is attacked by mysterious cyborgs called Nexosporidium Warriors, who arrive from his own planet, which frightens both Crypto and his commander Pox. Soon Crypto finds himself face-to-face with a conspiracy from his own homeworld that, if not stopped, could destroy his entire race. In the midst of all the chaos, Crypto hears a voice in his head, telling him to go to the city of Shen Long. Later, Crypto, while in Sunnywood, is shot in the neck, faints, and then wakes up in a Kung Fu monastery where he is greeted by a Furon martial arts expert known as The Master. The Master beseeches him to submit to his tutelage, and train in mind and firepower, to help him defeat these new threats. Now Crypto is about to go down the path to enlightenment, shape his own destiny, and uncover who is behind this frightening conspiracy. = Destroy All Humans!

On their official Twitter account the company claimed: \\"We are thinking about what to do next with it.\\" In June 2016, Reihard Pollice, Nordic Games' product development director and executive producer, stated, \\"there are a few options we are evaluating now. Hope to get started on one of these soon.\\" In late 2016, the PlayStation 2 versions of Destroy All Humans! and Destroy All Humans! 2 were released on PlayStation 4 as part of the PS2 Classics lineup (a selection of PS2 games emulated on PS4, rendered at 1080p with additional features such as trophy support and remote play). In 2018, the Xbox version of Destroy All Humans! was added to the Xbox One's backwards compatibility catalog. On June 7, 2019, THQ Nordic announced a remake of Destroy All Humans! via a reveal trailer shown at E3. The trailer was set to the 2001 song \\"Ich will\\" by Rammstein and featured Crypto and the townsfolk singing along to the lyrics. The remake was developed by Black Forest Games and released on July 28, 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Stadia.

Williams was born in Bridgend in Wales and studied at the Hereford Cathedral School and St John's College, Oxford, where he read Modern History. His university studies were interrupted by World War II when Williams spent three years as an officer in the Royal Navy. He started in advertising as a medical copywriter, rising through the ranks to head David Williams and Ketchum, regarded as one of the largest and most successful advertising agencies in the country. He suffered a severe stroke in 1977 and whilst he eventually made a more or less complete recovery, he suffered partial paralysis and impaired speech for a time and realised that he would not be able to return to the stresses of life in the advertising industry. He had written crime fiction in his spare time, with Unholy Writ being written before his stroke in 1976. He turned from advertising to writing \\"whodunnits\\": he wrote 23 novels in all, most featuring Mark Treasure, graduate of Jesus College, Oxford and vice-chairman of a merchant bank, and his successful actress wife Molly. A second series of books featured Chief Inspector Merlin Parry of the South Wales Constabulary, together with Sergeant Gomer Lloyd. His books were twice shortlisted for the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger award and he was elected as a member of the Detection Club in 1988. He also was a churchwarden of St Mary Aldermary and a governor of Pusey House, Oxford. His ashes are interred in the churchyard of St Mary, Thorpe, Surrey - the nearest Anglo-Catholic parish church to his home, where he had been a Cantor and regular worshipper for many years.

Developed and initially produced by Berliet until Berliet was merged with Saviem to form Renault Trucks (now Arquus ), it lost to the Saviem VAB the competition to equip the French Army, even though it was cheaper than its competitor. Production stopped after less than 200 vehicles had been produced. Its main user, the French National Gendarmerie, calls it V√©hicule blind√© √† roues de la Gendarmerie (\\"Gendarmerie wheeled armoured vehicle\\") or VBRG. Design history Designed in the late 1960s under a project maximizing the use of heavy truck components of the Berliet brand in combat vehicles, the VXB 170 (for 170 cvie nearly 170 hp) entered production at the Berliet Bourg-en-Bresse plant. It was selected in 1972 by the French Gendarmerie but it lost out to the Saviem VAB the competition for equipment of the French Army and, following the merger of Berliet and Saviem under the Renault brand in 1974, became redundant in the brand product offering so production was stopped soon after the Gendarmerie order was complete Versions There were originally three versions : * internal security (procured by the Gendarmerie in 4 versions : basic vehicle, command vehicle, blade vehicle, and winch vehicle); * reconnaissance and patrol; * light combat. The VXB was available with hydrojets but this option was never exercised. Operators  Map of VXB-170 operators =Current operators= * - 155 VXBs were procured from 1974 for the mobile units of the French Gendarmerie, of which about 70 remain in service in continental France, Corsica and the French overseas territories (as of 2018).

It features the characters Savage and Akira, executive protectors ‚Äì \\"no mere bodyguard[s] but ... state-of-the-art defender[s]\\", an occupation also known as the \\"fifth profession\\". Plot Savage and Akira meet ‚àí seemingly for the first time ‚àí by Savage being dispatched by a Joyce Stone to liberate her sister, Rachel, whom Akira is guarding against that eventuality. Their brief clash triggers off memories of a previous meeting, where each believed he saw the other die in the course of a prior mission of protection together; memories that are quite obviously false, but that both believe to be entirely real. The two join together to uncover a string of other falsified memories, taking Rachel Stone with them ‚Äì thus fulfilling both protectors' missions; Savage's to retrieve her, and Akira's to protect her. This is a phenomenon that Savage identifies as jamais vu, a familiar situation not recognized by the observer (this is considered the opposite of d√©j√† vu). In the book, the occurrence of this phenomenon is explained by the discovery of evidence of brain surgery performed on both men, entailing a scarring of the temporal lobe of the brain, or the amygdala hippocampal area by an electrode inserted through the skull -‚Äì a process similar to that used to treat epilepsy ‚Äì while both men were subjected to a series of hypnosis and dramatic re-enactments of the false memories.. The process served to 'delete' Savage's and Akira's memories, and supplant them with falsified ones.  Title  At the beginning of the book, Morrell explains the title of the work: > No single historical event marks the origin of Savage's profession. The > skill to which he devoted himself has its antecedents prior to fact in the > haze of myth. At the start, there were hunters, then farmers, then with > something to be gained by barter, prostitutes and politicians. Given some > debate about precedence, those are the first four human endeavours. But as > soon as something can be gained, it must be protected. Hence Savage's[sic] ‚Äì > the fifth ‚Äì profession. Although his craft's inception has not been > documented, two incidents illustrate its valiant traditions. Morrell then goes on to cite these two particular events; the Japanese tale of the Forty-seven r≈çnin, telling of the honor and devotion of the bodyguards of a Lord Asano, a daimy≈ç or minor lord, even beyond his death; and the Battle of Maldon, in particular the Anglo-Saxon poem of the same name, detailing the unfailing loyalty of the comitatus, or household guard, of a local lord, Byrhtnoth. The common theme ‚Äì of protectors, and their loyalty to their masters ‚Äì is one to which both Savage and Akira intimately relate.

His poetic career, lasting only for seven years, made him one of the best-loved Georgian poets of the 20th century. Lado Asatiani was born in Kutaisi, on January 14, 1917, into a family of teachers. He received his secondary education in his native village Bardnala. He successfully graduated from Tsageri Agricultural Technique and became a student of Kutaisi Pedagogical Institute. In 1983 he left Pedagogical Institute. There he was introduced to and became a friend of George Napetvaridze. First poem ‚Äú·Éó·Éî·Éë·Éî·É†·Éï·Éö·Éò·É° ·Éì·Éò·Éö·Éê‚Äù was published in 1936 in Kutaisi\\"s newspaper Stalineli. The mother of poet Lida Tskitishvili was teaching Georgian language. She was arrested because of someone‚Äôs denunciation, was taken to Siberia and died in a foreign country. When Lado Asatiani‚Äôs first poem was published, he sent his mother the newspaper. At that time, the poet's mother was already dying. The first time she wasn't given the newspaper, but after requesting of Georgian prisoners, they read her son‚Äôs poem to Lida. Since 1938 Lado moved to work and to live in Tbilisi and began working in the newspaper \\"·Éú·Éù·É†·É©·Éò ·Éö·Éî·Éú·Éò·Éú·Éî·Éö·Éò\\", which was located opposite the opera. During this time he met his future wife Aniko Vachnadze, who worked as an economist in the writer‚Äôs union. At first, Lado met Aniko by chance in the street and sent a letter of anonymous love. In Aniko‚Äôs job writers decided to appear author of letter by handwriting. Finally, Revaz Margiani guessed that the author was Lado Asatiani. The love letter was torn to pieces by Aniko and because of this she was very worried. Aniko Vachnadze was one of the most beautiful girls. Before meeting Lado Asatiani, Simon Chikovani, Paolo Iashvili, Valerian Gafrindashvili, George Shatberashvili, Kolau Nadiradze, George Kuchishvili, Sergei Mixalkovi were devoted to Aniko poems. Later, all these poems were marked by Asatiani. After their first meeting, Lado Asatiani and Aniko Vachnadze got married in several days. They were introduced each other by close friend Nika Agiashvili. After marriage, first they lived at Aniko‚Äôs parents‚Äô house, after they moved to Dzerzhinski Street, in a small room with no windows. Its dwelling-space was only 14 square meters. The room had a glass on the door and the light of day was coming from this way. The poet got sick as an adult with tuberculosis. At this time consumption was incurable. When he felt bad, he was going to Abastumani. After feeling a little bit well he returned to Tbilisi. He could not walk on the upgrade, so his wife rented a room in hotel ‚ÄúOrient‚Äù. Their window was in front of the Lado Gudiashvili‚Äôs house. One day the poet told how much he wanted to be his book decorated by Lado Gudiashvili. Aniko told this story to Lado Gudiashvili‚Äôs wife. The poet's dream came true, but only after his death. When he died Lado Gudiashvili painted Asatiani‚Äôs portrait on the poet‚Äôs book.

Argentina's health care system is composed of a universal health care system and a private system. The government maintains a system of public medical facilities that are universally accessible to everyone in the country, but formal sector workers are also obligated to participate in one of about 300 labor union-run health insurance schemes, which offer differing levels of coverage. Private medical facilities and health insurance also exist in the country. The Ministry of Health (MSAL), oversees all three subsectors of the health care system and is responsible for setting of regulation, evaluation and collecting statistics.  Spending  In 2016, Argentina spent 7.5% of its GDP on health care expenditures.https://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/argentina_cavagnero.pdf  Health care  In January 2013, the Federal Registry of Health Establishments (Registro Federal de Establecimientos de Salud - REFES) indicated there were 5,012 health establishments operating in Argentina, including hospitals, clinics, and hospices, amongst others. The majority of the establishments (70% or 3,494 establishments) pertain to the private sector.Global Health Intelligence, \\"Global Health Intelligence\\" . Retrieved 16 January 2015. =Obras Sociales= The Social Security Sector is funded and managed by Obras Sociales (Insurance Plans), umbrella organizations for Argentine worker's unions. There are over 300 Obras Sociales in Argentina, each chapter being organized according to the occupation of the beneficiary. These organizations vary greatly in quality and effectiveness. The top 30 chapters hold 73% of the beneficiaries and 75% of resources Health Care in Latin America.http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_ThtshshOPIC.html. MSAS has established a Solidarity Redistribution Fund (FSR) to try to address these beneficiary inequities. Only workers employed in the formal sector are covered under Obras Sociales insurance schemes and after Argentina‚Äôs economic crisis of 2001, the number of people covered by these fell slightly (as unemployment increased and employment in the informal sector rose). In 1999, there were 8.9 million beneficiaries covered by Obras Sociales.Armando Barrientos \\"Reforming Health Insurance in Argentina and Chile\\" Health Policy and Planning 15(4): 420 There is a body within the social security sector in Argentina called \\"The Superintendence of Health Services\\" La Superintendencia de Servicios de Salud, which is in charge of setting the minimum coverage package that is included in the health insurance of every single health-care institution. This allows for a more transparent set of criteria for decision-making process within a sector of the Argentinean health-care system. Prior to 2000, workers did not have the freedom of choosing which Obra Social they contributed to and were covered by. This situation gave rise to some problems; e. g. a teacher living in a city where the gastronomy workers' Obra Social provided better care than the teachers union's Obra Social could not freely switch plans even when it would have been in their best interest. This was mended in the year 2000 when National Decree 446/2000 was signed into law which established changes to the regulation of Obras Sociales, allowing for workers to choose freely between Obras Sociales administered by different workers unions (although they are still obligated to adhere to one of the Obras and make regular payments). =Private sector= The private health care sector in Argentina is characterized by great heterogeneity and is made up of a great number of fragmented entities and small networks; it consists of over 200 organizations and covers approximately 2 million Argentines.IDRC Reshaping Health Care in Latin Americahttp://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=265. Private insurance often overlaps with other forms of health care coverage, making it difficult to estimate the degree to which beneficiaries are dependent on the public and private sectors. According to a 2000 report by the IRBC, foreign competition has increased in Argentina‚Äôs private sector, with Swiss, American and other Latin American health care providers entering the market in recent years. This has been accompanied by little formal regulation. =Public system= A system of public medical facilities is maintained by the government. The public system is highly decentralized, as it is administered at the provincial level; often primary care will be regulated autonomously by each city. Since 2001, the number of Argentines relying on public services has seen an increase. According to 2000 figures, 37.4% of Argentines had no health insurance, 48.8% were covered by Obras Sociales, 8.6% had private insurance plans, and 3.8% were covered by both Obras Sociales and private insurance schemes. Currently, about half of the population uses the public system.https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/argentina/healthcare/health- system/health-insurance  Health Policies  Patients need to apply for free care at public institutions and undergo a lengthy test in which they may be rejected at some hospitals. The rejection rate is usually 30-40%. Public hospitals in Argentina who have not converted to managed care principles are facing an influx of patients covered by privatized social security funds. Public hospitals in the city of Buenos Aires reported about 1.25 million outpatient visits by patients covered by the privately administered social security fund for retired person. The Provincial and Municipal Health Secretariats and Social works through the Superintendence of Health Services are in charge of allocation of resources and setting priorities. The Ministry of Health through its Sub-secretariat of Promotion and Prevention are in charge of Public Health Interventions. Local Health Secretariats in the provinces and municipalities through the department of purchases in the public sub-sector and individual social works are in charge of the reimbursement of new drugs. Elderly people face barriers due to copayments, private practitioners' refusal to see them and also because of nonpayment by the social security fund.

Lone attended Park Road Primary School and Duke of Gloucester (Now Jamhuri High) School in Nairobi. He won a scholarship to study Literature at Kenyon College in the United States (BA, 1965) as part of a major programme that President Kennedy initiated for university education for newly independent African countries, popularly known as the \\"US airlift.\\" He obtained his MA at New York University (1967) and was studying for his PhD when he won a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to teach and do research at Makerere University in 1968, but could not take up his appointment.See: Portrait of Salim Lone, Kenya's Political Gadfly. 12 January 2007 He began his career in journalism in the early 1970s in New York, where he worked for two years for the former Sunday NY Times Pulitzer Prize-winning Editor Lester Markel as a researcher and writer. In Kenya in Dec 1971 he became Editor of the Sunday Post at age 28, but quickly came under pressure for articles critical of Jomo Kenyatta's, and (after 1978), Daniel arap Moi's governments. Forced out of the Sunday Post in 1974, Lone became founding editor of Viva, a politically conscious women's magazine in Kenya, which won widespread Kenyan and international recognition, with the United Nations in 1980 during the Copenhagen Women's Conference listing it as one of the world's eight most influential women's magazines, along with Ms. in the US, Emma in Germany and Manushi in India. The magazine regularly highlighted the issues of poverty, corruption, women's rights and diminishing freedoms of expression and association in Kenya. Lone was regularly grilled and harassed by Special Branch police officers, and in 1981 became the only journalist in independent Kenya to have been prosecuted and convicted for his journalistic work, along with the Nobel Peace Prize Winner, the Kenyan environmental and pro-democracy fighter Wangari Maathai. Eventually, his troubles under the Daniel arap Moi regime worsened to the point where he fled to the US to avoid arrest in June 1982, His citizenship was subsequently revoked by President Moi for \\"disloyalty\\" to Kenya, but restored in 1993. United Nations Upon arriving in New York in 1982, he was hired by the UN as a communications officer. Invited back to Kenya in 1986 by Foreign Minister Elijah Mwangale, he was arrested and taken to Nyayo House's infamous torture chambers. He was freed under pressure from the United Nations and expelled from Kenya, and his citizenship was revoked. Back at the UN, Lone rose to its highest non- political rank when he was appointed by UN secretary General Kofi Annan as Director of its News and Media Division (1998-2003).AROUND THE WORLD; U.N. Official Stripped Of Kenyan Citizenship, The New York Times, 10 September 1986 Earlier, as Chief of Publications, Lone worked closely with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Chief Editor and writer to initiate and publish the scholarly UN Blue Books series which documented the role the Organization played in mobilizing global support for pivotal issues of the 20th century, such as opposition to apartheid, the advancement of women, the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty and the genocides in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, whose criminal courts became models for the International Criminal Court. Lone's last UN assignment was as UN Spokesman in Iraq right after the 2003 US- led invasion. His boss Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21 other colleagues in Baghdad were killed in a terrorist attack on Canal Hotel in August, but Lone survived with minor injuries.Blast hits UN building in Baghdad, BBC, 19 August 2003. AFTER THE WAR: THE SCENE; Amid Blood and Rubble, A Sense of Helplessness, NYT, 20 August 2003 - By NEIL MacFARQUHAR Kenyan political spokesperson After retiring from the UN, Lone returned to Kenya in 2004 after he was appointed the Government Spokesman for the Mwai Kibaki regime, the first democratically elected government since Kenya's December 1963 independence, but the appointment was rescinded before he actually took it up. He then became Spokesman for Raila Odinga, the opposition leader and was the communications director for the first 2005 referendum on a new Constitution which the Opposition won. After that he became a columnist for the Daily Nation, and wrote regular columns for the Guardian, UK, and was published in many other newspapers such as The NY Times, The Washington Post, The Globe and Mail (Toronto), The Financial Times, The Independent, The Times of India and Dawn (Pakistan).The Nation: Salim Loneselvesandothers.org: Salim Lone.; earlier he had been published by the NY Review of Books and The New Republic. Lone was also frequently interviewed by the BBC, Al Jazeera and CNN, including on Charlie Rose, Newsnight, Inside Story and Larry King Live. He was the principal figure in three documentaries on the disastrous US-led in the Iraq war and occupation, by Al Jazeera, and the public TV stations of Japan (NHK) and the Netherlands. In 2007 he again became Spokesman for Raila Odinga before the 2007 presidential election.raila2007.wordpress.com: Raila Odinga's Campaign blog. Lone's appointment mentioned 23 November 2007. Opposition Seeks New Vote As Violence Ebbs in Kenya, NYT, 5 January 2008. But Lone's forceful public advocacy for a robust international involvement in finding a negotiated solution to end the mass violence that followed the tainted presidential election - which resulted in President Kibaki having to create the position of Prime Minister for Mr Odinga - led to many death threats, and he had to flee Kenya again.raila2007.wordpress.com: Raila Odinga's Campaign blog.

Lone subsequently resigned from his government position in September 2008 but continued to be Prime Minister Odinga's Spokesman till 2013, PM spokesman Salim Lone retires, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, 10 September 2008 After the disputed March 2013 election, it fell upon Lone to announce that Prime Minister Odinga would not accept the 2013 election result as the vote-tallying process was marred by vast discrepancies, but that he would pursue electoral justice through courts without the mass demonstrations his supporters were demanding. The Supreme Court upheld the election verdict and declared Uhuru Kenyatta lawfully elected president. Salim Lone once again received death threats and left Kenya permanently soon after the election. The book \\"War and Peace in Kenya\\"  Lone now lives in Princeton, New Jersey, where he is writing his book - War and Peace in Kenya - on the extraordinary transformations and disasters that marked the Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga era in the 2003-2013 period (and the subsequent Uhuru Kenyatta presidency). The book also examines how change takes place in a country in which fabulous wealth and utter deprivation exist side and side, and where a powerful elite has controlled all the levers of power and wealth throughout the half century of independence. The book pays particular attention to the role, both positive and negative, the international community (including US President Barack Obama) played in this period, especially in the crimes against humanity trials of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The book is supported by grants from the Ford Foundation, the Open Society Institute, the Institute of International Education and the Norwegian government.

He was noted for the controversial behavior of his troops at the Battle of Saltville, where an estimated 10-50 wounded black Union cavalrymen were killed on the battlefield and in the field hospital. Early life Robertson was born in Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas, to Mary (Cummins) and Jerome B. Robertson, who would also serve as a Confederate general. He attended Baylor University and went to West Point in 1857, but left before graduation to serve the Confederacy. Civil War Robertson was initially commissioned as a second lieutenant in the artillery of the Confederate Army, Robertson went to Charleston, South Carolina, and participated in the shelling of Fort Sumter. He then went to Florida, where he served as a staff officer for Brigadier General Adley H. Gladden at Pensacola. In early 1862, Robertson became captain of an artillery battery from Alabama and fought at the Battle of Shiloh in April. He served at the Battle of Stones River at the end of the year. He was promoted by Braxton Bragg to the rank of major and given command of the reserve artillery battalion of the Army of Tennessee, which he led at Chickamauga in September 1863. Robertson was subsequently promoted to lieutenant colonel and reassigned to command the Confederate horse artillery under Joseph Wheeler. He participated in the 1864 Atlanta Campaign. Robertson's performance drew the attention of senior commanders, and on July 26, 1864, he was appointed brigadier general (temporary). He became Wheeler's chief of staff. He married Sarah Davis while on a furlough. Late in the year, Robertson was assigned a field command, leading first a brigade and later a division of cavalry. Robertson participated in a victory over Union troops at the First Battle of Saltville in Smyth County, Virginia on October 2. Many of the Federal troops participating were negroes, and over 100 were massacred by a group of guerillas associated with Robertson's troops on October 3. Robertson had bragged to another officer that \\"he had killed nearly all the Negroes.\\"\\"Was there a Saltville Massacre in 1864?\\" David Brown's analysis His conduct was such that when Robert E. Lee learned of it he communicated to General John C. Breckinridge his dismay \\"that a general officer should have been guilty of the crime you mention\\" and instructed Breckinridge to \\"prefer charges against him and bring him to trial.\\"McKnight, Brian D.

Davis, in his book An Honorable Defeat. The Last Days of the Confederate Government (2001), said that Robertson personally \\"join(ed) in the act of villainy\\", although he escaped prosecution.

One of the most colorful figures in the 19th-century Georgian culture, Orbeliani is noted for his patriotic poetry, lamenting Georgia's lost past and independent monarchy. At the same time, he spent decades in the Russian military service, rising through ranks to highest positions in the imperial administration in the Caucasus.  Family  Grigol Orbeliani was born into a prominent aristocratic family in the Georgian capital of Tiflis (Tbilisi), three years after the Russian government deposed the Bagrationi dynasty of Georgia and annexed their kingdom. His father Dimitri (Zurab), a prince of the House of Orbeliani, served at the court of the last Georgian kings, while mother Khoreshan n√©e Andronikashvili was a granddaughter, on her mother, Princess Elene‚Äôs, side, of Erekle II, the penultimate and popular king of Georgia, whose cult would later be introduced into Georgian literature by Grigol Orbeliani himself. Orbeliani had close family and friendly ties with the contemporary Georgian aristocratic and literary √©lite: Nikoloz Baratashvili, the most important poet of Georgian Romanticism, was his sisterly nephew; Orbeliani was in love with Griboyedov‚Äôs widow and Alexander Chavchavadze‚Äôs daughter, Nino, who inspired the poet with desperate, but courtly passion for nearly thirty years, although he had been betrothed in the cradle to Princess Sopio Orbeliani.Rayfield, pp. 139, 143-4. He was a cousin of the two poets and generals - Alexander and Vakhtang Orbeliani. To distinguish himself from his namesake cousins, Grigol Orbeliani also used an ancestral name \\"Qaplanishvili\\".Rayfield, p. 143.  Service career  Orbeliani received his early education at local nobility gymnasium and artillery school. In the 1820s, he entered the Russian military service, and took part in a series of expeditions against the Dagestani tribes, and the wars with the Ottoman and Persian empires. In March 1833, he was arrested by the Russian police in Nizhny Novgorod for his involvement with the 1832 conspiracy of Georgian nobles who plotted to murder Russian officials and reestablish Georgia's independence from the empire. Orbeliani was placed in the Avlabar prison in Tiflis, but was soon released as, due to his absence from Georgia, his contribution to a planned coup was limited to an intellectual support such as translations from the Decembrist ideologues and a bellicose poem, The Weapon (·Éò·Éê·É†·Éê·É¶·Éò). By virtue both of his aristocratic status and his abilities, Orbeliani was able to resume his military career and would rise to high positions in the Caucasus Viceroyalty. He, like many other Georgian nobles who years earlier had plotted to overthrow the Russian hegemony, would make peace with the imperial autocracy, a change aided by liberal policies of the Russian viceroy Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov. A typical romanticist and patriot in his poetry, Orbeliani, like his older contemporary, fellow poet and general Alexander Chavchavadze, remained a loyal officer in the imperial service throughout his career.Suny, pp. 75, 124.Kveselava, p. 16. Orbeliani spent most of his military career in the Caucasus War against the rebellious mountaineers, with a brief spell in the Neva Infantry Regiment in Wilno (Vilnius, Lithuania) as a punishment for his participation in the 1832 conspiracy. On returning to the Caucasus in 1838, he mostly fought in Dagestan and was made colonel in 1846. Being in command of the Apsheron Infantry Regiment, Orbeliani played a decisive role in storming the Dagestani stronghold Gergebil in 1847/8 and was promoted to major general in 1848. In the following years, he governed the restive districts of Avaristan, and Tchar-Belakan, and oversaw the Lezgin line. He fought off an attack by Shamil, a leader of anti-Russian insurgency in the North Caucasus, and scored a series of victories over the rebels in Tchar-Belakan in 1853, winning the rank of lieutenant general. In 1855, he was made commander of the pre-Caspian troops and promoted to adjutant general in 1857. He was appointed chairman of the viceroy's council in 1857 and three years later became governor-general of Tiflis, acting as a de facto viceroy in 1862. Orbeliani was further promoted to Infantry General in 1864 and received a seat in the State Council in 1866. He was an advocate and organiser of a new social order in the Caucasus. In 1871, the Imperial administration organized, in Tiflis, a 50-years anniversary of Orbeliani's service, attended by the visiting Tsar Alexander II who awarded the general an Order of St. Andrew, the highest in the empire. In old age, he switched his fervor to the promotion of literacy and education for Georgians and publication of Georgian heritage as well as sponsoring literacy programs for the Abkhaz and Ossetians. He was a member of the Imperial Geographical Society and an Honorary President of the Georgian Nobility Bank. In the 1880s he played a leading role in establishing a standard text for Shota Rustaveli's medieval epic The Knight in the Panther's Skin.  Cultural legacy  Although Orbeliani's earliest writings are in prose dating to 1824, his prose pieces have fallen into oblivion. Most of his poetry is noted for patriotic motifs and extravagant praise of wine and women. Like his contemporary Georgian romanticists, Orbeliani's lyrics are pervaded with laments over the lost past and the fall of the Georgian monarchy. What distinguishes him, however, is his love for the street poetry and the ashug minstrelsy to which he himself added with such lyrics as Mukhambazi (·Éõ·É£·ÉÆ·Éê·Éõ·Éë·Éê·Éñ·Éò).Rayfield, p. 144., Russian translation by Nikolay Zabolotsky, music and song by Elena Frolova (first song in record) Orbaliani's poetry prior to the collapse of the 1832 conspiracy is remarkably bellicose and optimistic, while post-1832 lyrics are more elegiac, infused with sentimental patriotic feelings about the irretrievable glory of the past. His best and longest works is an ode A Toast, or A Night Feast after War near Yerevan (·É°·Éê·Éì·É¶·Éî·Éí·É†·É´·Éî·Éö·Éù, ·Éê·Éú·É£ ·Éù·Éõ·Éò·É° ·É®·Éî·Éõ·Éì·Éí·Éù·Éõ ·É¶·Éê·Éõ·Éî ·Éö·ÉÆ·Éò·Éú·Éò, ·Éî·É†·Éî·Éï·Éú·Éò·É° ·É°·Éò·Éê·ÉÆ·Éö·Éù·Éï·Éî·É°) whose original version was composed on the occasion of the battle of Yerevan during the Russo-Persian War in 1827, not without influence of the Russian poet Vasily Zhukovsky. It was further reworked and expanded until it acquired its final shape as late as 1879. A nostalgic memory of military glory, the poem begins by honoring all those who have fallen in defense of their homeland, then the poet travels through history, celebrating all Georgia's tribes, kings, heroes, and martyrs. Finally, an elegiac mood replaces the exaltation, as the poet returns from his fantasy and memoirs to see just himself and one other link to that past still living.Rayfield, pp. 144-5. Orbeliani's mutual relations with the new generation of Georgian intellectuals were ambiguous. This new movement, dubbed as \\"the sons\\", spearheaded by Ilia Chavchavadze and Akaki Tsereteli, was critical of \\"fathers\\", old Georgian nobility who had pledged their allegiance to the Tsar. Orbeliani was praised by Chavchavadze as presiding over \\"the strength and wealth of our verse,\\" but his 1871 jubilee was met by the younger generation in cold silence. In the 1860s, Orbeliani tried to stand aside from the quarrels between \\"the sons and the fathers\\", but he could not refrain from attacking the new generation in a caustic rhymed response published in 1874. This did not prevent him, however, from being alone in acclaiming the melodramatic prose of one of the \\"sons\\", Alexander Kazbegi, in 1881.Rayfield, pp. 143-4. Grigol Orbeliani died in Tiflis at the age of 79. He is buried at the Kashveti Church of St. George. Notes  References  *Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History.

Edwin Forrest Durang (April 17, 1829June 7, 1911) was an American architect. He kept offices in Philadelphia and specialized in ecclesiastical and theatrical design. Life and career Durang was born in New York City, into a distinguished theatrical family. His grandfather, John Durang (1768‚Äì1822), has been credited with being the first native-born American actor, and his parents, Charles Durang (1791‚Äì1870) and Mary White Durang (b. London, England, 1802), were also well known for their contributions to the stage. His father and uncle, Richard Ferdinand Durang, were the first to perform \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", and his father also worked as the director and prompter at both the Chestnut Street Theater and the American Theater in Philadelphia. After his retirement in 1853, Charles Durang taught dancing and wrote several books on dance and a history of the Philadelphia stage. In addition to her stage work, Edwin Durang's mother wrote six children's books. Durang was named for his father's friend, noted actor Edwin Forrest. Little is known of Durang's youth or education, but by 1855 he had set up as an architect in Philadelphia. By 1857 he had begun working with John E. Carver, a residential and ecclesiastical architect. On Carver's death in 1859, Durang succeeded him, emulating his practice by also specializing in ecclesiastical design, mostly for the Roman Catholic Church. He designed many churches, rectories, convents, and schools throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and elsewhere during a practice of more than fifty years. In November 1909, Durang was joined by his son Francis Ferdinand Durang (1884‚Äì1966), who, in turn, succeeded him after his sudden death in Philadelphia in June 1911. Edwin Forrest Durang's great-grandson is the American playwright and actor Christopher Durang (1949‚Äì). Works In addition to the buildings listed below, which were almost entirely his own projects, he made interior alterations to the Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul in Philadelphia. He contributed to the interior of the Academy of Music, 1854. He was also responsible for substantial additions and alterations to the Pro-cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul in Scranton, Pennsylvania prior to the building's reconsecration as the Cathedral of St. Peter in 1883. =Philadelphia= Church of the Gesu (1879-88), Girard Avenue & 18th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania *All Saints Roman Catholic Church, Bridesburg. *St. Agatha ‚Äì St. James Church (formerly St. James Church), 38th and Chestnut Streets, University City. *St. Agatha's Roman Catholic Church, 38th and Spring Garden Streets, Powelton Village. *St. Joseph Hall (1903) and Main Chapel (1884‚Äì1891), Chestnut Hill College.E.F.

The eastern side lies in Edwards and the west side in Wayne; the county line runs down the main street. History Ellery was created in 1880 and was named for the man who surveyed the railroad right of way and the town blocks. William Lines had donated many lots for the settlement and had been instrumental in securing the stock pens built there on the railroad. Therefore, it was suggested that the town should be called Linesville. However, when that name was submitted for the name of the post office, it was rejected as there was already a Linsville in the state. The post office has always been on the east side of the street in Edwards County, so the town is listed in Edwards County, Illinois. The business section of town was always in Wayne County. Although Ellery never had a school within its limits, it early built a church, the Ellery Christian Church, which still functions. At one time there was a woolen Mill which stood at the north end of Ellery. For several years a creamery operated at the south end. Although small, Ellery is compact and neat. It is composed of forty-five lots, each 66x 132 feet in size. The streets were of the same width and named Main, Edwards and Wayne. The alleys were 12 feet wide. In all, the town covers a square with sides only one-eight of a mile long. For a considerable time, Ellery was quite a busy place. At one time it had five stores kept by Mr. Lance and son, Albert Kimbrell, Morris Mckibben and George Knodell. They also had two barber shops kept by Thomas meadows and Frank Clutter. Ezra Michels built the first house in Ellery. The first store was built in 1882, north of the railroad and operated by Bob Ramsey and Ted Woods. George Pettigrew had one of the first stores in Ellery. It was in Wayne County. Others, including Morrie McKibben, later had a store in that same building. Al Kimbrell had a store near the same spot for several year: he was also postmaster during the first decade of the 19th Century. a Mr. Land then kept store in the same building. Later Nell Rook Murphy (the postmistress) and May Inskeep Woods operated a store there. Lafayette lines built a frame store, south of the railroad tracks, which Mr. Lance bought and moved across the street and farther south where it was used as a blacksmith shop by Wright Willis. At one time George Stroup had a large sawmill and grist mill, about 40 x 50 feet in size and three stories high. In July 1915 a grain elevator was constructed.

The town has never had more than a few residents and has served primarily as a filling station along the I-80 corridor (and U.S. Route 40 corridor before it). Since the completion of the freeway, the town has essentially become a ghost town. History Delle was established in 1880 as a railroad village along the Western Pacific line, primarily as a water depot for steam engines in preparation for the trek across the famous salt flats. It was originally named Dalles Spring, from a French word referring to water, but railroad personnel later shortened the name for telegraphic efficiency. It possessed a water tower, a reservoir, and numerous homes where railroad employees and their families resided from at least 1920 until 1940. The inhabitants were primarily Irish, Scot and Greek immigrants. Water was obtained from springs located as far as away in nearby mountains (Delle Ranch located along the east bench of Skull Valley being the primary) and piped to the site. After diesel powered engines were introduced, Delle continued as a site station for railroad employees in charge of track upkeep between Wendover, Utah and Salt Lake City. As of the 1950 United States Census, the population was 174. During the 1950s a gas station and small motel were constructed. The railroad homes were demolished, and the railroad abandoned the site. Delle was owned by local businessman Karl William Winsness, Jr. for most of the 1970s, and water was hauled in by truck from Grantsville. Karl was injured in a propane explosion while remodeling the motel and cafe in the early 1980s. I-80 at Delle, November 2007 In 1999, the frontage road on the southwest side of I-80, from the Delle Interchange (Exit 70) northwest to the Low/Lakeside Interchange (Exit 62), as well nearly of county and BLM roads southwest the frontage road, were all designated as Utah State Route 900 (SR-900), a Statewide Public Safety Interest Highway. The purpose of this designation (and for the similarly created Utah State Route 901) was to prevent the construction of rail spur from Union Pacific Railroad's Shafter Subdivision (ex-Western Pacific Railroad), to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation. This proposed rail spur would be necessary for the Skull Valley Goshute Tribe to carryout its plans to store 40,000 tons of nuclear waste on the reservation. By creating the Statewide Public Safety Interest Highways, the Utah Department of Transportation would have to give permission to construct the rail spur, something adamantly opposed by the Utah state government. Despite the designation as a state route, the roadways included as part of SR-900 were expressly intended to remain in their current, mostly unpaved, status and \\"may not be upgraded or improved to a higher class of highway\\".

She served in the North Atlantic during World War II and participated in the International Ice Patrol in these waters after the war. She was the first dedicated oceanographic vessel in the Coast Guard's history. She was decommissioned in 1990 and sunk by the US Navy for target practice in 1992.  Construction and characteristics  Evergreen was built at the Marine Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company yard in Duluth, Minnesota. Her keel was laid down on 15 April 1942. The ship was launched on 3 July 1942. Her original cost was $871,946. Her hull was constructed of welded steel plates framed with steel I-beams. As originally built, Evergreen was long, with a beam of , and a draft of . Her displacement was 935 tons. While her overall dimensions remained the same over her career, the addition of new equipment raised her displacement to 1,025 tons by the end of her Coast Guard service. She was designed to perform light ice-breaking. Her hull was reinforced with an \\"ice belt\\" of thicker steel around her waterline to protect it from punctures. Similarly, her bow was reinforced and shaped to ride over ice in order to crush it with the weight of the ship. Evergreen had a single stainless-steel five-blade propeller driven by a diesel-electric propulsion system. Two Cooper-Bessemer GND-8 4-cycle 8-cylinder Diesel engines produced 700 horsepower each. They provided power to two Westinghouse generators. The electricity from the generators ran a 1200 horsepower Westinghouse electric motor which turned the propeller. She had a single cargo boom which had the ability to lift 20 tons onto her buoy deck. The ship's fuel tanks had a capacity of approximately . Evergreen's unrefueled range was at 13 knots, at 12 knots, and at 8.3 knots. Her potable water tanks had a capacity of . Considering dry storage capacity and other factors, her at-sea endurance was 21 days. Her wartime complement was 6 officers and 74 enlisted men. By 1964 this was reduced to 5 officers, 2 warrant officers, and 42 enlisted personnel. Evergreen was armed with a 3\\"/50 caliber gun mounted behind the pilot house. She also had two 20mm guns, one mounted on top of the wheelhouse and one on the aft deck. Two racks of depth charges were also mounted on the aft deck. She also was equipped with mousetrap anti-submarine rockets. All of this armament was removed in 1966 leaving Evergreen with only small arms for law enforcement actions. At the time of construction, Evergreen was designated WAGL, an auxiliary vessel, lighthouse tender. Her namesake was the evergreen tree, in conformance with the Coast Guard tradition of naming buoy tenders after trees and shrubs.  World War II service (19421945)  Evergreen began her World War II service with brief postings in the Great Lakes and Charleston, South Carolina. She was then home-ported in Boston, where she spent the remainder of the war. Her primary mission was weather patrol in the North Atlantic. Between August 1943 and July 1944 she sailed from Boston, Portland, or Agentia out to designated points in the ocean to take weather readings which were radioed back to shore. These trips typically lasted about three weeks. This timely, mid-ocean weather data allowed military planners to route aircraft directly from the United States to England, saving the long delay in shipping aircraft by freighter. She rotated on these weather patrols With USCGC Sorrel and USCGC Conifer.Evergreen in the North Atlantic during World War IIOn 26 July 1944 she departed Argentia, escorting two merchant ships to Greenland. On 31 July she made a sonar contact and fired 16 anti- submarine projectiles at what was later concluded to be either whales or a cold water layer in the ocean. She arrived at Narsarssuaq on 1 August 1944. She patrolled up the east coast of Greenland to Cape Pansch, and supplied remote military bases including radio direction finding stations attempting to localize German U-boats and German weather stations in Greenland. On 19 November 1944 Evergreen landed a party of 27 soldiers on the east coast of Greenland to investigate possible enemy activity. She broke channels through the ice to allow other ships to reach port on several occasions. Evergreen sailed to the United States for repairs at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in February 1945, but returned to Greenland in April 1945. She continued her work supplying remote bases, icebreaking, and building and maintaining aids to navigation. As World War II ended in Europe, her work went into reverse. She evacuated men from their remote bases. On 28 September 1945 she completed the evacuation of Cape Dan.  Post-war service (19451964)  After the war Evergreen remained based at Boston. She serviced remote LORAN stations in the North Atlantic and was involved in a number of search and rescue missions. In August 1947 she towed the disabled 90-foot fishing boat Dartmouth 450 miles back to Gloucester. In September 1947 she took in tow the disabled Army transport Flemish Bend off Newfoundland. A celebrity rescue took place in September 1953, when Evergreen rescued Malcolm Forbes, publisher of Forbes Magazine, when his yacht broke down in the path of an advancing hurricane. On 25 July 1956 the Italian liner Andrea Doria, with 1706 passengers and crew aboard, collided with the liner Stockholm off Nantucket and began to sink. Andrea Doria had 1,706 passengers and crew aboard. Evergreen, returning to Boston from ice patrol, was diverted to the scene. She arrived at 8:06 am on 26 July 1956 and took command of the rescue effort. By that time there was little she could do. She radioed, \\"S.S. Andrea Doria sank in 225 feet of water at 10:09 A.M.\\" After the sinking, Evergreen searched an 80-square mile area around the wreck for 40 people that had not been accounted for. She found none. She was joined by USCGC Yakutat and USCGC Fredrick Lee in recovering floating debris from the site. The Coast Guard ended this effort on 30 July. In April 1948 Evergreen was the first buoy tender assigned to the International Ice Patrol. In this mission she would sail into the North Atlantic during the spring thaw. While off the coasts of Newfoundland, Labrador, and Greenland, she would assess conditions that could carry dangerous icebergs into shipping lanes. This was the first off a decades-long series of ice patrol cruises. While on these patrols crewmen and visiting scientists sampled water temperatures using Nansen bottles, and currents using a geomagnetic electrokinetograph. She deployed a deep-sea buoy to collect oceanographic data. Between 1948 and 1986 Evergreen was on ice patrol at least thirty-four times.  Oceanographic vessel (19641982)  USCGC Evergreen with iceberg during the 1965 International Ice Patrol USCGC Evergreen launching an experimental oceanographic buoy In 1964, Evergreen was converted to an oceanographic vessel and re-designated WAGO-295. She was the first dedicated oceanographic vessel in the Coast Guard's history. During the conversion, a computer was installed, and Evergreen became the first government oceanographic ship to have one. As an oceanographic vessel, she was also converted from a black-hull paint scheme to a white-hull paint scheme, which she wore until decommissioned. Her ice patrol duties continued under her new designation, and extended further into the Arctic. In 1964 she explored Kennedy Channel, north of Baffin Bay, with a team of scientists from the University of Washington, Dartmouth, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Her oceanographic studies took her across the Atlantic to Germany in 1965. In 1966 she sailed to the coast of Brazil to take water temperature, salinity, and oxygen content readings. On 23 December 1968 Evergreen suffered a major fire in her engine room while tied to the pier at the Coast Guard's Boston base. Two of her crew were overcome by the smoke. The fire was put out in two hours, but damage was extensive. She was repaired at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland and was back at sea by April 1970. In 1972, Evergreen underwent a $2 million renovation at the Coast Guard Yard. New fresh water and sewage systems were installed. A bow thruster was added to increase her maneuverability. Crew quarters were renovated and modernized. The deckhouse was expanded and new laboratories were added. In March 1973 Evergreen sailed to her new homeport, New London, Connecticut. She left almost immediately for her regular ice patrol in the North Atlantic.  Medium endurance cutter (19821990)  By 1982 aircraft and satellites had grown in their capacity to monitor ice in the shipping lanes, leading to less reliance on ship-based data. Also, in 1970 the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration was established, and it too had grown in its capabilities. Amidst Reagan- administration budget cuts, the Coast Guard's oceanographic research program was ended. Evergreen was converted to a Medium-Endurance Cutter, and re- designated WMEC-295. For the rest of her career she would focus on law enforcement and fisheries management missions. She got right to work in her new role, seizing an Italian vessel off the coast of New Jersey fishing illegally for squid in September 1982. On 1 May 1983 she boarded a vessel 35 miles off Montauk and discovered 26 tons of marijuana. When Evergreen brought the boat back to New London, it became the largest drug seizure in Connecticut history to that time. The sailboat she seized in 1984 had 4 tons of marijuana in her cargo. Evergreen caught another sailboat smuggling 700 pounds of cocaine in Florida waters in 1990. The Coast Guard considered decommissioning Evergreen when the oceanography program she supported ended in 1982, but the ship was retained as a medium-endurance cutter. Her retirement was then linked to the construction of her replacement in the medium-endurance cutter fleet, USCGC Tahoma. Evergreen was finally decommissioned on 26 June 1990, 48 years after her launch. During the course of her Coast Guard service she was awarded the Unit Commendation twice, the Meritorious Unit Commendation three times, the Arctic Service Medal, and the E-ribbon, among other honors. She was used by the U.S. Navy as a target and sunk during a fleet exercise on 25 November 1992.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department referred to Tropical Cyclone 03B as \\"Tropical Cyclone Yemyin\\". At the time, the official WMO body responsible for tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea, the India Meteorological Department (IMD), did not name the storm. However, the IMD reassessed the system to have reached cyclonic storm strength, and retroactively named the storm Yemyin.. ‚ÄúYemyin‚Äù means Hippo in Myanmar (Burma) Language. Throughout three countries, 983 people were killed: 730 in Pakistan, 140 in India and 113 in Afghanistan. In all, the storm wrought roughly $2.1 billion in damage in India and Pakistan. Meteorological history A low pressure area associated with the monsoon trough was first detected by the Naval Research Laboratory in the Bay of Bengal on June 17. Over the next few days, it developed deep flaring convection near an exposed low-level circulation centre (LLCC) as it drifted in open sea. Despite moderate to high vertical wind shear, the disturbance produced surface pressure falls of up to 2.7 mbar (hPa) in Port Blair, in the Andaman Islands, on June 19. Convection persisted around the increasingly well-defined LLCC, and the disturbance continued to consolidate under favourable diffluence. Early on June 21, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) declared the area a depression, 430 km (270 mi) east-southeast of Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, India. Several hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), with winds near 30 kn (55 km/h, 35 mph). The depression moved quickly west-northwest towards the northern Andhra Pradesh coast. A subtropical ridge to the north weakened the wind shear which had been paralysing the system, allowing for further intensification. Later that day, the IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression. As convection organised with increasing ocean heat content, the JTWC issued its first warning on Tropical Cyclone 03B. The deep depression made landfall near Kakinda early on June 22 local time. The JTWC issued its final advisory later, as the system began to weaken due to land interaction and wind shear. The next day, the IMD downgraded it to a depression while it crossed the Deccan Plateau. The final warning was issued on June 24, despite the storm having moved into the Arabian Sea. The JTWC noted in its Significant Tropical Weather Outlook for the North Indian Ocean on June 24 that strong monsoonal low-level flow contributed to increased cyclonic vorticity, with low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. It warned that these factors could lead to a rapid regeneration of the cyclone. Early on June 25, the JTWC issued the second TCFA for this system as its LLCC crossed the coast into the Arabian Sea. Shortly after, both the IMD and the JTWC resumed advisories on the depression. As it moved northwest just off the Pakistani coast, winds of about 26 kn (48 km/h, 30 mph) and a surface pressure of 990 mbar (hPa) were observed in Karachi near midday on June 25. According to the PMD, the centre of the system reached within 90 km (55 mi) of Karachi. With favourable conditions and deep convection, the system intensified into a deep depression that day. After further organization, it made its second landfall at about 0300 UTC June 26 along the Makran coast, near Ormara and Pasni, Balochistan province, in southwestern Pakistan. Upon reaching land, the cyclone began to weaken slowly, and the JTWC issued its last advisory late on June 26. Impact Cyclone Yemyin making landfall in the Balochistan Province =Pakistan= In Karachi, Pakistan, about 213 people died from rains and winds of 111 km/h (69 mph) that might have been associated with an outer band of the cyclone. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had warned of heavy rains and wind from the system as early as Friday June 22. The cyclone trapped 2 merchant ships: Al- Picaso and Lady Hamad, and 4 fishing boats: Al-Taif, Al-Noor, Sumbal Sultani and Al-Tariq, 100 nmi (185 km, 115 mi) off Karachi. The Pakistan Navy rescued 56 sailors from the merchant ships and 36 fishermen from the fishing boats after they were detected by Breguet Atlantique aircraft. The heavy downpour also flooded the Kech Korandi riverine, inundating the city of Turbat and causing more than 10,000 people to evacuate their houses. At least 380 people died in Balochistan, with another 250 dead in Sindh and 100 in the North-West Frontier Province, and further rains associated with the remnants of the cyclone hampered rescue efforts. The cyclone affected at least 10 districts of Balochistan and 4 districts of Sindh, affecting the lives of atleas 1.5 million people. At least 2 million people were affected by the cyclone. More than 2 million livestock, worth over 4 billion rupees, were killed by the storm. =India= The storm killed at least 140 people in India, while it was still in the Bay of Bengal Property losses from the storm were estimated at 24 billion rupees. =Afghanistan= Over 80 people were killed in floods associated with the remnants of Yemyin in Afghanistan. Naming Yemyin means Hippo in Myanmar. The PMD referred to the deep depression as Tropical Cyclone Yemyin, the next name on the list at the time. The IMD, the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for the North Indian Ocean, did not operationally upgrade or name the system due to intense Indo-Pakistani relations. However, on August 6, the IMD reassessed the deep depression to have reached cyclonic storm strength, and retroactively designated the system as Cyclonic Storm Yemyin in its mid-season review. This was confirmed by the designation of Cyclonic Storm Sidr, the next name on the list after Yemyin, in November.

The folklore originated in China and then spread to other Asian cultures.Windling, Terri. The Symbolism of Rabbits and Hares. In East Asian folklore, the rabbit is seen as pounding with a mortar and pestle, but the contents of the mortar differ among Chinese, Japanese and Korean folklore. In Chinese folklore, the rabbit often is portrayed as a companion of the Moon goddess Chang'e, constantly pounding the elixir of life for her; but in Japanese and Korean versions, the rabbit is pounding the ingredients for mochi or other some other type of rice cakes. In some Chinese versions, the rabbit pounds medicine for the mortals. Unrelated moon folklore arising among native cultures of the Americas, also have rabbit themes and characters.  History  The Chinese mythological white hare making the elixir of immortality on the Moon is embroidered onto an eighteenth-century Imperial Chinese robe An early Chinese source called the Chu Ci, a Western Han anthology of Chinese poems from the Warring States period, notes that along with a toad, there is a hare on the Moon who constantly pounds herbs for the immortals. This notion is supported by later texts, including the Song-era Taiping Imperial Reader. As rabbits were not yet introduced to China during Western Han, the original image was not a rabbit but a hare. Han Dynasty poets call the hare on the Moon the \\"Jade Hare\\" (ÁéâÂÖî) or the \\"Gold Hare\\" (ÈáëÂÖî), and these phrases were used often, in place of the word for the Moon. A famous poet of Tang China, Li Bai, relates how \\"The rabbit in the moon pounds the medicine in vain\\" in his poem, \\"The Old Dust\\".  Asian folklore  Sun Wukong fights the Moon Rabbit, a scene in the sixteenth century Chinese novel, Journey to the West, depicted in Yoshitoshi's One Hundred Aspects of the Moon In the Buddhist Jataka tales,Source: (accessed: Saturday January 23, 2010) Tale 316 relates that a monkey, an otter, a jackal, and a rabbit resolved to practice charity on the day of the full moon (Uposatha), believing a demonstration of great virtue would earn a great reward. When an old man begged for food from them, the monkey gathered fruits from the trees and the otter collected fish, while the jackal found a lizard and a pot of milk-curd. The rabbit, who knew only how to gather grass, instead offered its own body, throwing itself into a fire the man had prepared. The rabbit, was not burnt, however. The old man revealed that he was ≈öakra, and touched by the rabbit's virtue, drew the likeness of the rabbit on the Moon for all to see. It is said the lunar image is still draped in the smoke that rose when the rabbit cast itself into the fire. The rabbit is believed to be a Bodhisattva. A version of this story may be found in the Japanese anthology, Konjaku Monogatarish≈´, where the rabbit's companions are a fox, instead of a jackal, and a monkey. The moon rabbit legend is popular and part of local folklore throughout Asia. It may be found in diverse cultures in China, Japan, India, Korea, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar.http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/jatakas-birth-stories-of- bodhisatta-IDH502/ This legend also gave rise to the Mid-Autumn Festivals of China and Vietnam, Tsukimi of Japan, and Chuseok of Korea, Sampeah Preah Khae in Cambodia, all of which celebrate the legend of the moon rabbit. In Vietnamese mythology, the Jade Rabbit on the Moon is often accompanied by the Moon Lady and Cu·ªôi, who sits under a magical banyan. The trio has become the personifications of the holiday, when they descend to the mortal world and give out cellophane lanterns, mooncakes and gifts to children.Fairy Tale of Moon Lady in Vietnam  Rabbits in indigenous American moon folklore  Presumed to be arising likewise, through lunar pareidolia, legends of moon rabbits also exist among some of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. These legends are not considered to have been influenced by Asian cultures. The Maya moon goddess frequently is depicted holding a rabbit In Mayan art, glyphs, hieroglyphics, and inscriptions, a rabbit frequently is shown with their Moon Goddess and another deity related to the moon. According to an Aztec legend, the god Quetzalcoatl, then living on Earth as a human, started on a journey and, after walking for a long time, became hungry and tired. With no food or water around, he thought he would die. Then a rabbit grazing nearby offered herself as food to save his life. Quetzalcoatl, moved by the rabbit's noble offering, elevated her to the Moon, then lowered her back to Earth and told her, \\"You may be just a rabbit, but everyone will remember you; there is your image in light, for all people and for all times.\\" Another Mesoamerican legend tells of the brave and noble sacrifice of Nanahuatzin during the creation of the fifth sun. Humble Nanahuatzin sacrificed himself in fire to become the new sun, but the wealthy god Tecciztecatl hesitated four times before he finally set himself alight to become the Moon. Due to Tecciztecatl's cowardice, the deities felt that the Moon should not be so bright as the sun, so one of the deities threw a rabbit at his face to diminish his light. Another version of the legend says that Tecciztecatl was in the form of a rabbit when he sacrificed himself to become the Moon, casting his shadow there. Farther north in America in a region now identified as ranging across Canada and United States, a Cree cultural legend tells a different story, about a young rabbit who wished to ride the Moon. Only the crane was willing to take him there. The trip stretched the crane's legs as the heavy rabbit held them tightly, leaving them elongated as the legs of all cranes are now.

That trademark was adopted by Ahnelt shortly after he founded Pictorial Review. It symbolized the $13 capital with which he started his dress pattern business upon coming to the United States. Pictorial Review was published in two languages: english and spanish. The Spanish edition was printed a million four hundred thousand copies. The director of the Spanish edition was R√≥mulo Manuel de Mora, from Huelva (Spain). By the late 1920s it was one of the largest of the \\"women's magazines\\". In June, 1931 it enjoyed a circulation of 2,540,000. In 1936, the publisher sold the magazine to its Vice President, Adman George S. Fowler. In 1937 it merged with The Delineator, another women's magazine. However, two years later, with the Great Depression causing upheaval among magazines, it ceased publication.Pictorial Review, MagazineArt.org, Retrieved July 14, 2007 From 1935 to 1939, activist and feminist Lena Madesin Phillips served as an associate editor.

A spy kicked out of the Agency is stuck in Miami, Florida, where he helps locals who can not rely on the police. In the opener, Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) finds himself cut off from his contacts and his cash, so he agrees to help a man clear his name in a high- priced art theft. Along the way he gets help from his ex-girlfriend and a retired Navy SEAL, and grief from his mother, who is unaware of his career. Plot While on assignment in Nigeria, covert operative Michael Westen learns that he's been \\"burned\\". For a spy, it is the equivalent of being fired. A burned spy is blacklisted from all government agencies and resources; his bank accounts are frozen and his credit is trashed. Michael barely escapes Nigeria and wakes up, battered, in a motel in Miami, Florida. In order to survive and fund his own personal investigation, Michael enlists the help of the only two \\"friends\\" he has: Fiona Glenanne, an ex-IRA operative who also happens to be an ex-girlfriend, and Sam Axe, a washed-out military intelligence contact who has been under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He is also forced to deal with the family he went halfway around the world to get away from‚Äîparticularly his mother, Madeline Westen, who could not be happier to have her son back in town. Through former spy- turned-security consultant Lucy Chen‚Äîwhom Michael helped learn the trade‚Äîhe gets a lead on a small investigation job: a caretaker of an estate, Javier (David Zayas), has been accused of stealing valuable art from his employer, Graham Pyne (Ray Wise). All evidence points to it being an inside job and Javier, with very little money to offer, has nowhere else to turn. When Michael begins to dig around, he quickly discovers that it was in fact an inside job: Pyne orchestrated the robbery and framed Javier in order to collect insurance. Michael confronts Pyne with the incriminating evidence. When Pyne and his bodyguard come after Javier and his son, Michael is already a step ahead of them and has set up a trap at Javier's house. After the smoke clears, Pyne has accidentally shot his bodyguard, and Michael has enough evidence to send both of them to jail for conspiracy to commit kidnapping. With the mounting evidence hanging over his head, Pyne agrees to clear Javier's name and provide financial support to Javier and his son. Meanwhile, Michael keeps trying to get in touch with his old government handler, Dan Siebels (Dan Martin), who will not accept his calls. Deciding to get creative, Michael resorts to mailing Siebels a fake bomb in order to get his attention. The ploy works, and Michael finally gets to confront Siebels about the burn notice. Siebels believes Michael has probably been framed and there is nothing he can do to help him, but that he still has allies within the Agency. He tells Michael not to leave Miami, unless he wants a FBI manhunt after him. To top it all off, Michael returns home to find his door open and the floor covered with surveillance photos. It is not the FBI, but whoever it is, they have been tracking his every move. And they have left a message: \\"Welcome to Miami.\\" Production The pilot was originally produced to be shown as a two- hour movie or as two one-hour episodes. When USA decided to broadcast it uninterrupted, it was edited to fit a 90 minute time slot; this version is also on the Season 1 DVD. The two-part version was eventually shown in Australia.http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=69651 Filming began in December, 2006. Reception Approximately four million viewers tuned into the series premiere of Burn Notice. Jeff Commings of the Arizona Daily Star felt the first episode was better than the second, and overall the show was \\"good, not great.\\" The teleplay by Matt Nix won a 2008 Edgar Allan Poe Award, honoring the best in mystery, in the category Best Television Episode Teleplay.

In 2016, the Green Party of Michigan elected 5 officers to local governments. In Michigan the Green Party elected a candidate to office in its first year. That candidate was JoAnne Beemon who became the first Green elected in Michigan, when on election day 2000 she received 5,349 votes (86%) to become Drain Commissioner in Charlevoix County. Beemon was credited with thwarting construction of a Wal-Mart store, by formulating storm water runoff regulations stricter than the county stormwater ordinance. She informed Wal- Mart of this on February 12, 2004. Two months later in a phone call to Beemon on April 6, 2004, Wal-Mart project manager Allen Oertel acknowledged that the company altered its plan based on information from Beemon that it did not previously know of.

Wilson State Park, a 36-acre wooded area with 160 campsites, borders the lake to the northwest with a sandy beach. In the early 1900s century, several lumber mills operated on the Budd Lake shoreline, and a lumber company that operated in the late 1800s donated Wilson State Park to Michigan. The lake is popular among anglers, particularly for its muskies, some longer than 40 inches, along with bass, panfish, perch and walleye. Dropoffs near the shore provide deep water refuge; the lake is up to 30 feet deep, with the south end being shallower. There is a single public boat ramp at the southern end of the lake.  VHS Fish Disease  The Michigan DNR announced on May 17, 2007 that Budd became the first inland lake in the state of Michigan confirmed to be infected by viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). The DNR analyzed fish specimens after a very large die-off that began on April 30, 2007 of muskies, bluegills, and black crappie. VHS is an infectious virus- spread fish disease responsible for mass die-offs of many species, but not linked to any human health concerns.Crawford, Franklin. Cornell researchers confirm that deadly fish virus has spread to 19 species, threatening sport- fishing industry. Chronicle Online. Cornell University. 17 May 2007. Retrieved 14 July 2007. The disease can be spread between bodies of water through live or frozen bait fish, roe, contaminated fishing equipment, live water wells in boats, and ballast water, among other ways. Boats and fishing equipment should be disinfected before transfer from Budd Lake to other destinations. The DNR announced that tests confirmed the continued presence of the virus in 2011, following a die-off of large mouth and small mouth bass, bluegills, and pumpkinseed sunfish in April to May 2011. Fish specimens collected in May were among those used in testing the effectiveness of StaRT-PCR testing compared to cell culture and conventional qRT-PCR DNA testing, which avoided false negatives that occurred with the other techniques.

Early life Brown was born in Methven, Perth and Kinross, Scotland. In the period between 1824 and 1826 Brown acquired land at Bowenfels, effectively creating the first European settlement in the Lithgow Valley. He then acquired of land in the valley, around Cooerwull Brook (now known in Lithgow as Farmer's Creek). The property originally used for grazing, became known as Cooerwull after the small blue flowers which grow in the area. A suburb in Lithgow still retains the name. Development of Lithgow The next phase of life was replete with a number of changes to his property which fostered Lithgow's economic development. In 1837 Brown established a water driven flour mill on Cooerwull Brook to process the wheat grown both on his own property and on other properties in the Lithgow Valley. In the 1860s Brown claimed to have found coal on his land, however it was Alfred Carter who was working on property at the time. He used coal to power his flour and later tweed mill. Coal was later to become and still currently is one of Lithgow's major exports, although the road system of the time did not permit this coal to be exported east to Sydney. Philanthropy As well as being an enterprising industrialist, Brown is also remembered as being a major contributor to the social fabric of the Presbyterian community of Lithgow and even New South Wales. In 1851 he founded the Cooerwull Academy, a Presbyterian boarding school for boys, and also built the Methven church and the current Bowenfels Presbyterian church, as a school house for the children of itinerant rail workers in the area. He was also a leading force in the creation of St Andrew's College at the University of Sydney.

A total of 595 episodes were taped at CFTO-TV in Toronto, Ontario. It was hosted by Stephen Young during the show's first season, but from the second season on, it was hosted by the husband-and-wife duo of Fergie Olver and the show's creator Catherine Swing. Olver announced the series during its first season. The format was to determine which child and mother knew each other the best through answer-matching as well as the memorable Bake-off Challenge. Three teams, consisting of a young child and his or her mother (or occasionally father), competed on each episode. Repeats aired on the launch schedule for YTV in 1988, and on GameTV from 2008 to 2010. On September 22, 2009, marblemedia announced they acquired the rights to Just Like Mom and plan to create a new and updated version called Just Like Mom and Dad.Mediacaster: \\"Interactive Elements Added to Returning TV Hit, Just Like Mom\\", 9/22/2009.Canadian Press (via Canoe): \\"'Just Like Mom' returning to TV\\", 9/22/2009. In 2017, the new show was picked up by Yes TV in Canada and BYU TV in the United States for broadcast in 2018. Gameplay =Question rounds= The parents were secluded offstage while the children answered several questions. Early in the show's run, they would choose from one of five categories for the questions, while later in the run, a specific question was pre-assigned to each team. Each host would alternate between asking each child, making two cycles of the three children. Afterwards, the parents would come back and they would be posed the same questions to see if they could match the answers their children gave, using a format similar to The Newlywed Game. A correct match on the first questions earned 10, and the second was worth 15. For the second question round, the process repeated with the parents answering first and the children trying to match. Correct matches in this round were worth 20 points for the first question, and 25 for the second. =The bake-off/taste test= Between the two question rounds, the children had a bake-off to complete a given recipe, which came from the Robin Hood Just Like Mom Cookbook, in 60 seconds. (There were some episodes where the time limit was 90 seconds but it was later changed back). They were given all the basic ingredients (as well as some unorthodox ones) and were allowed to use whatever they wanted in their creations. After the second question round, the parents tasted each of the three creations while the children were taken to another part of the stage. They had 30 seconds to taste each of the numbered dishes and then decide which one they thought their child made by holding up a numbered sign (later a ping pong paddle) at the same time as their child at the other part of the stage with the team with the lowest score going first. A correct match was worth 50 points. =Bonus round= The team with the highest score spun a wheel divided into 16 sections marked with different prizes; they won whatever prize the wheel landed on. If two teams tied in the main game, both would spin the wheel for a prize. The grand prize was a trip for two to Walt Disney World; it was featured on four slots on the wheel. In the case of twins playing, each child would spin once; if the first spin landed on the Disney World trip, the second spin would be voided. In later seasons, all contestants received a prize of a trip to Camp Onondaga, one of the oldest private summer camps in Canada. While there were a collection of prizes available on the prize wheel, including prizes from sponsors such as Chuck E. Cheese's, Robin Hood Flour, Playmobil and John Deere, the grand prize to Walt Disney World was the most memorable and coveted prize available.

Their uncle, David Nyberg, supplied much of the initial capital to start the company. The company name of Nylint is a combination of both the Nyberg and Klint names. It was incorporated under the name ‚ÄúNylint Tool and Manufacturing‚Äù and its initial operation was located at 5th Avenue and 13th Street in Rockford. Original founder Bernard (known as Barney) Klint and his wife Grace remained actively involved for nearly 60 years in this privately held company until their deaths in the mid-1990s. History Looking back on Nylint‚Äôs 60-plus year history, they survived by constantly evolving ‚Äì changing their direction to meet the demands of the diverse toy market. One can see at least eight phases of their history. These phases, or ‚Äúeras,‚Äù often overlap. =Early years= The company began (1st Phase pre- World War II) producing kitchen utensils. Nylint also did special-order tooling work for other companies. For example, they produced refrigerator door handles and cast aluminum parts for the automobile industry. In 1940, the company moved to a larger factory 16th Avenue where it remained for 60 years. As with most manufacturers, World War II caused a shift to making war-related products. During the war years, Nylint prospered while employing 50 employees who made anti-aircraft magazines and torpedo-related components for the Federal government. Nylint produced, almost exclusively, war-related products during 1941‚Äì1945. After the war, Nylint worked to establish its post-war direction. After an extensive study in late 1945, the company decided upon toy production. This decision was made primarily because of Nylint‚Äôs modern metal- stamping facilities. Nylint hired Carl Swenson, the inventor of a wind-up toy car with steering and directional actions, based on the Chrysler Airflow design. Nylint called this the ‚ÄúAmazing Car.‚Äù When introduced at the 1946 Toy Fair in New York City, it was a huge success with over 100,000 units ordered. Nylint had a solid product, and it was marketed well ‚Äî being packaged in an attractive box with a color picture of the toy on the outside. Also, the box included a diagram of the detailed motions the toy could perform. After World War II there were several large manufacturers of pressed-steel toys in this country. In addition to Nylint, Tonka, Buddy-L, Structo, Smith-Miller, Doepke, Marx, and Wyandotte were some of the most successful. Others, including Tru- Scale, All-American, and Ertl, later joined the ranks of toy truck producers. Aside from Buddy-L, Marx, Structo, and Wyandotte, who had previously made toys, most of these companies started moving into toy manufacturing immediately after the war. =1940s to 1950s= An early toy power shovel by Nylint In the late-1940s and early-1950s, Nylint remained committed to wind-up toys and soon produced a front-end loader wind-up which resembled a forklift. They then designed and built a couple of motorcycle tin wind-ups, a street sweeper wind-up (resembling an Elgin machine) and a wind-up that resembled a popular TV icon  Howdy Doody  although Nylint never used the name to advertise the toy. The Elgin Street Sweeper demonstrated the success of toys patterned after real-life vehicles. In 1951 Nylint started to make high- quality construction toys that were patterned after real construction machinery. The first construction toy was patterned after the Tournarocker made by the R.G. LeTourneau Company. While it was high-quality, it did not have the high price of toys made by Smith-Miller and Doepke. Smith-Miller and Doepke, because of increased competition, were soon forced out of business. Nylint also introduced a second heavy construction toy in 1951, a large high- quality road grader. This toy, while realistic, wasn't patterned after any specific manufacturer‚Äôs grader, although it did resemble an Adams grader of the day. Through the mid-1960s, Nylint produced toys patterned after manufacturers such as LeTourneau (now part of Cameron International), the J.D. Adams & Company of Indianapolis, the Frank G. Hough Company of Libertyville, Illinois, the Pettibone-Mulliken Corp. of Chicago, the Austin-Western Works of Aurora, Illinois, and the Clark Equipment Company of Benton Harbor, Michigan. Nylint made their toys as realistic as possible, and they gave credit to the real-life manufacturers. By the early-1950s, demand for quality toys was paramount as the first wave of post-war baby boomer boys (and girls) were hitting the ages of four to eight. Disposable income was high, and the demand for pressed-steel trucks and other toys was at an all-time high. For several years in the early to mid-1950s, Nylint made construction pieces exclusively. In 1956, Nylint started to take advantage of the Cold War military craze. They made several missile-launching gun toys and made an uncharacteristic plastic ballistic missile set. These military toys had many operating features and sold well. Nylint also made a couple of battery-operated toys in this period including a modified version of the Elgin Street sweeper and a military Electronic Cannon truck. During the late 1950s, Nylint‚Äôs construction toys, while high-quality and realistic, moved away slightly from the requirement that the toy be a replica of real-world equipment. After the cold war phase ended in the early 1960s, Nylint returned to its strict ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù formula. Other toy companies were moving in the opposite direction‚Äîgoing to more generic or futuristic looking toys not patterned after real vehicles. This phase began around 1959 and peaked about 1965 when Ford toys dominated the Nylint product line. This era lasted throughout the 1960s into the early-1970s. By 1962, Nylint was producing Ford toy replicas for Ford dealership promotions. Nylint was building excellent renditions of the Ford F-100 line of trucks, the Ford ‚ÄúC‚Äù tilt-cab, and the smaller Econoline series. By the mid-1960s the company also made a replica of the Ford Bronco. Nylint was blatant about using the Ford label on its toys, stamping ‚ÄúFord‚Äù on tailgates, above the grille, on hubcaps, depicting the Ford ‚ÄúTwin-I-Beam‚Äù badge, and a detailed hood decal. Some of these Ford toys were exclusives for Ford dealers, such as a Nylint pickup replica of a camper that housed a Philco AM radio, and was an enticement to bring parents into dealerships. During this phase, in addition to the Ford trucks and pickups, there were several Nylint Ford jalopy hot rods made. =1966 to 1976= Nylint Chevrolet Blazer Baja Nylint then moved away from realistic Ford trucks to more modern-looking toys‚Äîsome with futuristic styling. This ‚ÄúMod Styling Era‚Äù phase started about 1966, and by 1968 was a significant part of the Nylint Product line. Nylint‚Äôs Ford toy trucks, while still being manufactured to resemble a full-scale truck, lost some of their Ford detail identity. ‚ÄúFord‚Äù was removed from hubcaps and the Ford hood decal disappeared. New toys introduced were either of the ‚Äúturbine‚Äù cab style or other modern 1970s look. Many were painted in the then-popular fluorescent colors. As part of the marketing strategy, many toys in this era were being geared towards girls with brightly painted color schemes and animal accessories. Although toys from this era may not be as collectible as earlier toys, Nylint‚Äôs profits during this period showed their willingness to change with the market. By 1974, Nylint had only one truck that resembled a Ford, the Ford U-Haul Maxi-Mover. All the rest of its line was generic or of the ‚ÄúMod‚Äù look. In 1974 Nylint introduced a few realistic toy models patterned after the Chevrolet truck cab. After the mid-1970s, Nylint began producing Private Label Collectibles. The company continued to have some generic toys among its products as well as toys patterned after Chevy trucks. For an additional 25 years Nylint made many realistic toys patterned after real-world trucks using actual corporate logos. Nylint made toy replica truck/trailer rigs for hundreds of companies. Most of these rigs used a truck cab resembling a GMC Cabover or a Conventional Freightliner, although a newer Ford Conventional cab was used as well. Nylint, in the mid-'70s, was one of the first toy manufacturers to produce collectibles and it was a significant part of their output during their last 25 years. Nylint continued to make many other ‚Äúnon-collectible‚Äù toys during this period, as well. =1970s to 1990s= Nylint Freightliner 50th Anniversary Truck Through the 1970s and into the 21st century, Nylint had continued to make pressed-steel trucks. Most of the other popular pressed-steel producers had gone out of business, were bought by larger companies, or entered other toy-making arenas. They released a series of moderately successful Thomas the Tank Engine toys in the early to mid-1990s. 1996 Nylint Celebrate the 50th Anniversary and relays a Limited Edition Freightliner 18-Wheeler. In 1996 the Nylint Corporation would celebrate 50 years in the toy making business but also lost their founder Bernard Klint who passed away on September 2; his wife Grace passed a year earlier on October 24, 1995. The company was left in the hands of their sons. Nylint continued to make pressed-steel toys. End of an era 2001 In January 2001, declining sales forced Nylint to file for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection, but some operations continued. In April 2001, Funrise Toy Corporation of California bought Nylint Corporation securing the rights to the Nylint branding. All of Nylint's new inventory and current toy molds were moved from the Rockford, Illinois headquarters to Funrise's operations, officially ending Nylint's production of toys. Finally, in June 2001, all remaining Nylint assets including many vintage toys, some metalworking machines, a few vehicles and office equipment were sold at auction at its headquarters in Rockford, Illinois. The facility was then shuttered. An era of 55 years of Nylint toymaking had ended. While firm employment numbers are elusive, it is believed Nylint employed nearly 400 people during its manufacturing peak in the early 1970s. But by the time Funrise had announced its purchase of Nylint, only about 80 people remained. Still, Nylint managed to remain a self-owned, independent toy company for a decade longer than one of its main competitors, Tonka Toys, which was bought by Hasbro in 1991. Hasbro still produces Tonka branded toys. A hydraulics business, which supplies parts for the construction vehicle industry, now occupies the former Nylint headquarters in Rockford. Since the official takeover of Funrise, the classic Nylint Semi Trucks are still available for advertising purposes for companies from SMSA, Rockford, IL 61109. Nylint reappears briefly The Nylint brand reappeared again in Summer of 2005. Funrise's creation was called the Nylint Rock Crawler; a remote controlled, four-wheel drive vehicle designed for rugged terrain. It was available in 1/6 scale and 1/18 scale. It enjoyed good sales and was produced until late 2007. As of November 2012, no new Nylint branded toys were being produced. Collectors Since the early 2000s, there has been an increase in the number of adult collectors.

He was one of the leading figures of Imaginism. Now he is mostly remembered for his memoirs that depict Russian literary life of the 1920s and his friendship with Sergei Yesenin.  Biography  Anatoly Marienhof was born into a Livonian nobleman's family in Nizhny Novgorod. Upon graduating from gymnasium in 1914, he was drafted and served during the First World War on Eastern Front. Marienhof's literary career started in 1918 when he participated in the Imaginists' manifesto \\"Deklaraciia\\", published in Voronezh. The manifesto was signed also by Sergei Yesenin and other Moscow poets. Together they started a new poetic flow called Imaginism. Marienhof participated in all Imaginist actions and publications. He himself published a dozen books of poetry in 1920‚Äî1928. He became a close friend of Yesenin with whom he shared a flat during some months. Marienhof is the dedicatee of some of Yesenin's major works, including the large poem Sorokoust, the drama Pugachov and the tract on poetics Maria's Keys'. Marienhof gained further renown with his controversial fiction: \\"The Novel without Lies\\" (1926) and \\"The Cynics\\" (1928). The former presented his fictionalized (although still largely accurate) recollections of his friendship with Sergei Yesenin; the latter was a story of the life of young intellectuals during the revolution and the War communism. Both were met with sharp criticism in the Soviet press. \\"The Cynics\\" was published in Berlin (Petropolis), and not in the Soviet Union until 1988. After the publication of his last novel, \\"Shaved Man\\", in 1930 in Berlin and parts of his historical novel \\"Ekaterina\\" (1936), Marienhof was reduced to writing for theatre and later for radio without any hope of being published again. Yesenin's works were edited in the USSR for a long period of time to omit the dedications to Marienhof. In his later years, after Joseph Stalin's death, Marienhof wrote mostly memoirs; they were published several decades after his death in 1962.

Her family was moved to a small estate in Poland, staying several weeks before being moved again. Almost six months later they found themselves in the vicinity of Dresden just in time for the bombing. From Dresden they were moved to Plauen in Saxony and eventually spent three years in Werdau before walking over 250 miles, after the death of Poewe's father, to cross into the British Zone near G√∂ttingen.

After Poewe married Irving Hexham the two co-authored Understanding Cults and New Religions (1986) and New Religions as Global Cultures (1997). Poewe began fieldwork in South Africa where she studied the rise of Charismatic Christian Churches and the relationship of their members to apartheid. This ground-breaking work resulted in an International Conference held at the University of Calgary in 1993 on the topic of Charismatic Christianity as a Global Culture,Margaret Poloma, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 34, No. 2 (Jun., 1995), pp. 274-275 which led to the publication of a book with the same title.Karla Poewe, ed., Charismatic Christianity as a Global Culture. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press. 1994. Poewe's fieldwork in South Africa came to an end in 1989 when a close friend, the Rt. Rev. Londa Shembe, leader of one branch of the Zulu African Independent Church amaNazaretha, was assassinated and two other friends were also murdered. These tragedies led Poewe to redirect her research interests to looking at the role of missionaries in the areas of Africa where she had studied. The fall of the Berlin Wall enabled her to freely access the archives of the Berlin Mission Society. While working in these archives in 1995 she discovered a large amount of material dealing with conflicts between members of the Berlin Mission and National Socialists.Karla Poewe, New Religions and the Nazis, Oxford, Routledge. 2006:x-xi.

After spending several decades in reserve, she was sold for scrap in 1973. History Neunzer was named in honor of Machinist Weimar Edmund Neunzer, who was killed in action 2 July 1942 during the Aleutian Islands Campaign and was posthumously awarded the Air Medal. She was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corp., Orange, Texas, 29 January 1943; launched 1 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Weimar E. Neunzer, widow of Machinist Neunzer; and commissioned 27 September 1943, Lt. John E. Greenbacker in command. =North Atlantic operations= Neunzer steamed to Galveston, Texas, and then to New Orleans, Louisiana, for fitting out. During October and November 1943 she went through shakedown off Bermuda. The new destroyer escort next visited Charleston, South Carolina, en route Quonset Point, Rhode Island. For 4 weeks she operated with an Atlantic Fleet research group, developing new equipment for antisubmarine warfare. After escorting a group of troop transports from Boston, Massachusetts, to join a large convoy bound for England from New York City Neunzer proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, joining TF 62 on 1 January 1944. With this group she escorted a large convoy to the Mediterranean, spending 8 days at Gibraltar before sailing for home. = Escorting Italian submarines = On her homeward voyage, she shepherded five Italian submarines to Bermuda for training purposes. During this trip, Neunzer carried out an operation which is believed to be unique for a destroyer escort. She refueled two Italian subs at sea, pumping 12,000 gallons of fuel through a fire plug and 200 feet of fire hose to the submarine. In May 1944 Lt. Commander Virgil E. Gex became the skipper of the Neunzer. After two more voyages escorting convoys to the Mediterranean, Neunzer was detached from TF 62 to join escort aircraft carrier in a hunter-killer group. Following training at Casco Bay, Maine, and Bermuda, the task group made two search patrols for submarines in the Middle Atlantic, refueling in Bermuda. Neither of these patrols uncovered any submarines, and Neunzer returned to New York in late August. During October the group put to sea again, this time searching for submarines in the North Atlantic. Although no submarines were discovered, the force ran through a very severe storm which damaged some of the ships. The patrol was finally broken off; the task group refueled at Ponta Delgada, Azores, before returning home early in November. The antisubmarine group sailed from Norfolk 1 December for brief training in Bermuda en route Jacksonville, Florida, where for 5 weeks the carrier trained student pilots. The group proceeded to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, late in January 1945 for 2 weeks of exercises; then Neunzer returned to New York for a brief overhaul. After returning to Cuba for exercises in early March, the destroyer escort went to Miami, Florida, for 3 weeks as training ship for student officers of the Naval Training Center there. But now the Germans were ready for their final push, sending their new snorkel-equipped subs across the Atlantic to attack the east coast. Neunzer suddenly received a message at midnight 8 April to get underway 6 hours later for Newfoundland. After refueling and provisioning in Argentia, she left on the 19th and rendezvoused in mid-ocean with one of several carrier task groups strung out across the Atlantic between St. John‚Äôs, Newfoundland, and Fayal in the Azores as a net to trap the snorkels. = Battling German submarine U-546 = made contact with on 24 April and was proceeding to attack when the submarine fired a stern shot which tore the DE apart and sent her down with heavy loss of life. Eight destroyer escorts immediately joined the action. Neunzer and conducted a search while circled the area and picked up survivors. Flaherty made contact in less than an hour and with Pillsbury proceeded to attack. The U-boat went to 600 feet. Contact was lost from 1045 until 1201 when , , and began another attack. Neunzer got into the fight after several attacks by the other DE‚Äôs, delivering a creeping attack with Varian and Hubbard while directed. Contact was lost once more at about 1600, and Chatelain and Neunzer were ordered to return to the scouting line. The line was expanded, and the ships began a sweep through the area, determined to prevent the submarine‚Äôs escape. Varian made contact once more at 1731 and Flaherty was ordered to attack. She fired at 1810. Four minutes later a small oil slick began coming to the surface. Flaherty made another hedgehog attack at 1828, and at 1838 the U-boat broke surface. Every ship in the line within range began firing. At 1844, after more than ten and a half hours of attacks, rolled under for her last dive. Thirty-three of her crew, including the captain, were taken prisoner. = V-E Day = After V-E Day, Neunzer returned to New York for 2 weeks and left on 25 May to escort the last Atlantic convoy of World War II from New York to Southampton, England. She returned without a convoy, and remained in New York harbor from 15 June until 6 July. In July the ship trained at Casco Bay, Maine, and served as target for the Motor Torpedo Boat Training Center, Melville, Rhode Island. On 1 August she sailed to New London, Connecticut, to escort , captured by Guadalcanal‚Äôs task group in June 1944. The sub was exhibited along the east coast and the Gulf Coast throughout the end of 1945 in a drive to sell War Bonds. = Post-War decommissioning = After operations along the Atlantic coast, Neunzer decommissioned in January 1947 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Into 1970 she remained berthed at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On 1 July 1972 she was struck from the Navy list, and she was sold 1 November 1973, and scrapped.

After kicking 72 goals in three seasons he received a head injury during the 1976 pre season. Diagnosed with deformed blood platelets, he didn't play a senior game in the 1976 season. Despite being warned by the Carlton doctors over the danger of another head injury he joined North Melbourne during the 1977 season. He remained with the club until the end of 1978 but after managing only a total of 10 games he moved, this time to Collingwood. He kicked 88 goals in his debut season at Collingwood, topping the club's goalkicking charts for the year and falling 3 goals short of the Coleman Medal which was won by Kelvin Templeton. For the next two seasons he finished with over 50 goals and by the time he left the club in 1983 he had kicked a total of 251 goals. In 1988 at the age of 33 he made a surprise comeback to football, playing a season in Sydney with the Swans after being a development coach and team runner for the previous few years. Following his playing career, Craig Davis has remained active in football as an administrator with the NSW AFL.

During his career he served Cambuur Leeuwarden as well as a bunch of amateur clubs including VV Neerlandia '31. He died at the age of 28, when on 7 June 1989 he was killed in the Surinam Airways Flight PY764 air crash in Paramaribo. He was the brother of fellow professional footballer Winnie Haatrecht. Both Jerry and Winnie Haatrecht were known as talented youth players and were always playing at the Balboa Square in Amsterdam with their buddies Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard. All four they joined the youth squads of AFC Ajax and became part of a high quality group of players, where players such as Wim Kieft, Marco van Basten, Gerald Vanenburg, Sonny Silooy and John Bosman were also their teammates. Jerry and Winnie were not able to get a professional contract at Ajax and both left the club for a club in other regions of the Netherlands. Winnie signed for Willem II Tilburg, while Jerry moved to Cambuur Leeuwarden. Jerry was not successful in professional football, and decided to move to the amateur divisions and served several teams before joining VV Neerlandia '31. Before the start of the 1989-90 season he switched to yet another amateur team, when he signed a new contract for FC Sloterplas. Brother Winnie, at that time playing for SC Heerenveen was invited by Sonny Hasnoe, the founder of the Colourful 11 to be part of the team and travel to Suriname to play in the \\"Boxel Kleurrijk Tournament\\" with three Surinamese teams. However Winnie withdrew from the squad close to the deadline and as a result Jerry was asked to join the team instead of Winnie, which he immediately accepted. The Surinam Airways Flight PY764 crashed during approach to Paramaribo-Zanderij International Airport, killing 176 of the 187 on board, including Haatrecht, making it the worst ever aviation disaster in Suriname's history. Among the dead were a total of 15 members of the Colourful 11, only three of them survived. The crash and the appearance of both Gullit and Rijkaard at his funeral made Jerry Haatrecht a well known footballer worldwide. Winnie Haatrecht was shocked by the disaster and his brother's death. He decided it was better to move from all the media attention and signed a contract in the Swiss second division.

HOMS not only takes care of the Dominicans‚Äô health but also allows foreigners to have the opportunity to receive high quality health care at low prices in what is called \\"health tourism\\". HOMS has an investment of more than $80.0 million US dollars. HOMS will be looking to be accredited by the Join Commission of International Hospital Accreditation. History HOMS construction began at the end of the year 1999. The initial promoters of HOMS were: Dr. Rafael S√°nchez Espa√±ol, a very well recognized medical doctor in Santiago; Dr. Jos√© Hazim Frappier, former Senator of San Pedro de Macor√≠s who is currently Chancellor of Universidad Central del Este in San Pedro de Macor√≠s, Dominican Republic; Sonia Dillon, Ph.D, a graduate from University of Pittsburgh, Eduardo Estrella, Civil Engineer who created the hospital's Structural design and Ernesto Moquete, Electric Engineer who created the electrical wiring and panels for the hospital. Julio Rivera created the Architectural design. Both, Estrella and Rivera are part of the firm ECOPE which was in charge of the HOMS construction at that time. The construction of HOMS was paralyzed for three years due to the country suffering economic difficulties during the PRD government headed by Hip√≥lito Mej√≠a. The new PLD government, headed by Leonel Fern√°ndez, injected fresh money into this project in 2005. The Dominican government along with several very well known entrepreneurs from the city of Santiago are the major shareholders of this project. These entrepreneurs are: F√©lix Garc√≠a, Manuel Estrella, Fernando Capell√°n, Carlos Sully Fondeur, Angel Rosario Vi√±as, and Jos√© Clase, among others. Individually, they are owners of Dominican newspapers, TV stations, Industrial Free Zones and several other businesses. Dr. Sonia Dillon did the feasibility study for HOMS on August 6, 1999. She is actually a Professor in Health Services Administration at Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM). Dr. Dillon is also directing the LECOM-PUCMM exchange international program.

Dodan; June 13, 1870 ‚Äì May 12, 1922) was a Romanian Symbolist poet, essayist, and art and literary critic, who was also known as a journalist and left-wing political agitator. A wealthy landowner, he invested his fortune in patronage and art collecting, becoming one of the main local promoters of modern art, and a sponsor of the Romanian Symbolist movement. Together with other Post-Impressionist and Symbolist cultural figures, Bogdan- Pite»ôti established Societatea Ileana, which was one of the first Romanian associations dedicated to promoting the avant-garde and independent art. He was also noted for his friendship with the writers Joris-Karl Huysmans, Alexandru Macedonski, Tudor Arghezi and Mateiu Caragiale, as well as for sponsoring, among others, the painters »òtefan Luchian, Constantin Artachino and Nicolae Vermont. In addition to his literary and political activities, Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti was himself a painter and graphic artist. Much of Bogdan-Pite»ôti's controversial political career, inaugurated by his support for anarchism, was dedicated to activism and support for revolution. He also had an interest in the occult, and maintained close contacts with Jos√©phin \\"S√¢r\\" P√©ladan‚Äîsponsoring P√©ladan's journey to Bucharest (1898). He was detained by the authorities at various intervals, including an arrest for sedition during the 1899 election, and was later found guilty of having blackmailed the banker Aristide Blank. Late in his life, he led Seara, a Germanophile daily, as well as a literary and political circle which came to oppose Romania's entry into World War I on the Entente Powers' side. He was arrested one final time upon the end of the war, by which time he had become the object of public hatred. The enduring mysteries and contradictions of Bogdan-Pite»ôti's career have since drawn interest from several generations of art and literary historians. Biography =Early life and anarchism= A native of Pite»ôti, Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti was the son of a landowner from Olt,Tudor Vianu, p.370 and, on his father's side, the descendant of immigrants from the Epirote area of Ioannina, whose ethnicity was either AromanianCernat, Avangarda, p.42 Constantin Coroiu, \\"Pluta de naufragiu (2)\\" , in Evenimentul, December 30, 2002 or Albanian. Krikor Zambaccian, Chapter VIII: \\"Al. Bogdan- Pite»ôti\\", in √énsemnƒÉrile unui amator de artƒÉ, published and hosted by LiterNet. Retrieved July 14, 2007. His father became a local leader of the Conservative Party. His mother was a boyaress, and, as art collector and memoirist Krikor Zambaccian recounted, may have been a descendant of the Balotescu boyar clan. Bogdan-Pite»ôti also had a sister, Elena Constan»õa Bogdan; both she and her mother reportedly survived his death.Veronica Marinescu, \\"Un ¬´prin»õ al artelor¬ª uitat de vreme. Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti »ôi Vlaiciul primelor tabere de crea»õie\\", in Curierul Na»õional, July 22, 2006 As one of his eccentricities, Bogdan-Pite»ôti encouraged the‚Äîunsustainable‚Äîrumor that he was a direct descendant of an ancient Wallachian ruling house, the Basarab Princes.Mitchievici, p.346, 347‚Äì348 According to at least one account, Bogdan-Pite»ôti was educated in Geneva, at a local Catholic institution. Raised in the Romanian Orthodox faith, he converted to Catholicism in his twenties,Boia, p.189; Cernat, Avangarda, p.17, 42; Mitchievici, p.341, 344; TeacƒÉ, p.52 but was no longer a practicing Catholic by the time of his death. He supposedly attended medical school at the University of Montpellier, without ever graduating, and afterwards left to join the bohemian milieu of Paris. He may have enrolled at the University of Paris, studying Law and Letters, but probably withdrew after a short while. Art historian Sanda Miller recounts that Bogdan-Pite»ôti attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in the French capital, but that he was ultimately expelled.Sanda Miller, \\"Paciurea's Chimeras\\", in Apollo, October 2003 Other sources express doubt that the Romanian aristocrat was ever affiliated with any university or college, in either France or Switzerland.TeacƒÉ, p.52 According to literary historian Tudor Vianu, at that stage, the young man began associating with the criminal underworld. He soon established a connection with the French anarchist circles, while also associating with a branch of the growing Symbolist movement.Cernat, Avangarda, p.42; Mitchievici, p.337, 344; TeacƒÉ, p.52-54 Like others in his generation, he may have been driven by a desire for shocking and morbid experiences. According to art historian Theodor Enescu, these ranged from erotic experimentation to the \\"boisterous shivers of anarchism\\", and from criminal enterprise to decadent poetry.TeacƒÉ, p.53 Bogdan-Pite»ôti was a presence in the anarchist group of Auguste Vaillant (later guillotined for plotting a terrorist coup), and was possibly acquainted with some of the more prestigious anarchist intellectuals: √âlis√©e Reclus, Laurent Tailhade and (especially influential on him) F√©lix F√©n√©on.TeacƒÉ, p.52-53 Reports exist that Bogdan-Pite»ôti's politics were already a merger of opposite or hardly compatible doctrines. He respected Catholicism and Judaism as the most elevated religious cultures, rejected Orthodoxy, atheism and communism as ideologies for the mediocre, and depicted himself as a Catholic anarchist.Mitchievici, p.344, 357 He believed in craniometry, and took scientific racism at face value.Mitchievici, p.346-349 At some stage during the late 1880s, Bogdan-Pite»ôti became a supporter of General Boulanger, who attempted to gain power in France with support from the Orl√©anist, Bonapartist and socialist camps; he reputedly befriended the prominent Boulangist and Romantic nationalist thinker Maurice Barr√®s.Cernat, Avangarda, p.42. See also Mitchievici, p.327-328, 337 In parallel, he himself became a representative of literary and artistic Symbolism, and supposedly maintained contacts with authors such as Joris-Karl Huysmans, Maurice Maeterlinck, Octave Mirbeau, Jean Mor√©as, and Paul Verlaine.Cernat, Avangarda, p.42. See also Mitchievici, p.337; TeacƒÉ, p.52 Another influence on him was the occultist and novelist Jos√©phin P√©ladan, whose Rosicrucian salon he attended several times. Bogdan- Pite»ôti debuted as a writer and political essayist. It was later reported, but not confirmed, that he published his pieces in newspapers and magazines of diverse backgrounds‚ÄîLe Figaro, Le Gaulois, Gil Blas, L'Intransigeant and La Libre Parole among them. He also claimed to have played a part in staging the first Genevan showing of Richard Wagner's Die Walk√ºre. =Salonul Independen»õilor= Placed under surveillance due to his involvement in revolutionary politics by 1894,Boia, p.189 Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti was eventually expelled from France, despite Huysmans' intervention in his favor. Reputedly, the deportation document identified him as a \\"threat to public order\\".Ionescu, Mi»ôcarea..., p.234 One urban legend recounts that Bogdan- Pite»ôti was present at Vaillant's public execution and leaned over to kiss Vaillant's mangled body, which both disgusted and alarmed the judicial establishment.Mitchievici, p.127, 350, 389 Zambaccian suggests that the decision to deport the Romanian provocateur was not politically motivated. He writes that Bogdan-Pite»ôti had exhausted the patience of French authorities by trafficking in stolen bicycles. From France, Bogdan-Pite»ôti had contemplated the idea of revolutionizing Romanian art, and, upon his arrival to Bucharest, began organizing artists' reunions at the K√ºbler and Fialkowski coffeehouses.Rus, p.79 In 1896, with Post-Impressionist artists Constantin Artachino, »òtefan Luchian and Nicolae Vermont, he founded Salonul Independen»õilor, the Romanian replica of the French Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants.Jianu & Comarnescu, p.34-36; Lassaigne & Enescu, p.49-51, 104. See also Ionescu, Mi»ôcarea..., p.227-235; Rus, p.79 Adrian-Silvan Ionescu, \\"Artachino\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 222, May 2004 They were soon joined by painter Nicolae Grant and caricaturist Nicolae Petrescu-GƒÉinƒÉ.Jianu & Comarnescu, p.35 The exhibits featured some of Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti's own drawings, which he intended to use as illustrations for his book of French- language poems, Sensations internes (\\"Internal Sensations\\"). He planned for his art movement to reach outside Romania, and, also in 1896, financed an international exhibition of independent and avant-garde artists. Salonul was known for its public protest against academic art: located just outside the Romanian Athenaeum building (a main venue for local Neoclassicism), it put up Petrescu GƒÉinƒÉ's huge caricature of academic artist C. I. StƒÉncescu, and flew a red flag next to it. This call to socialist rebellion attracted public attention, and the flag was urgently taken down by agents of the Romanian Police. The subsequent exhibitions were viewed with sympathy by a section of the press, including the leftist newspaper AdevƒÉrul. It republished pieces ridiculing StƒÉncescu in his role of official curator, and made favorable comments on all of the Salonul Independen»õilor artists.Ionescu, Mi»ôcarea..., p.229-234 Noting the leader's own anarchist past, AdevƒÉrul art columnist Gal wrote: \\"Bogdan has all the qualities and flaws of a sincere French revolutionary, but one who is not entirely clear and scientific. He has an extraordinary love for all things independent and hates to the point of excess all sectarian people, and all schools.\\" In June 1896, the group of \\"secessionists\\" was commissioned to decorate Bragadiru Garden, where Romania's press held its annual fair. The show, attended by Bogdan-Pite»ôti, prominently featured StƒÉncescu's caricature at the entrance. Despite rhetoric, the new art club was not entirely opposed to tradition, and occasionally appealed to it as a basis for cultural reconstruction.Ionescu, Mi»ôcarea..., p.227-235; Amelia Pavel, \\"Pictura evreilor din Rom√¢nia: interferen»õe culturale\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 29, September 2000 Salonul boasted among its honorary members the lionized oil painter Nicolae Grigorescu, who had trained with the Barbizon school.Lassaigne & Enescu, p.51 Bogdan-Pite»ôti was especially fond of Luchian's work, and, in an 1896 article for the cultural magazine Revista OrientalƒÉ, spoke of him as \\"an admirable colorist\\", a \\"free spirit\\", and a purveyor of \\"revolutionary ideas\\".Lassaigne & Enescu, p.104. See also Rus, p.78-79, 80 He boosted Luchian's self-confidence, urging him to apply his talents to illustrating \\"an idea\\", and was entirely adverse to Grigorescu's traditionalist manner. Luchian still used Grigorescu as a source of inspiration in his own work, prompting scholars to argue that Grigorescu's Salonul Independen»õilor reception was Bogdan-Pite»ôti's unwilling concession to his star prot√©g√©.Jianu & Comarnescu, p.40 =Literatorul, Bronzes, Ileana= Bogdan-Pite»ôti was by then an inspiration for the blooming Romanian Symbolist movement. In effect, he was the first Romanian expert on the work of Symbolist celebrities like Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and (his favorite) Alexandre S√©on.Mitchievici, p.337-338 He soon became a contributor to Literatorul, a Symbolist magazine, and was close friends with its founder, Alexandru Macedonski. In 1897, he was chosen by the latter to edit and promote his book of French-language poems, Bronzes.Cernat, Avangarda, p.42; Tudor Vianu, p.369-371 In the end, Bogdan-Pite»ôti provided the funds needed for Bronzes to be published in Paris. It came out with an introductory note, in which Bogdan- Pite»ôti favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival Mihai Eminescu. In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pite»ôti as an unyielding Francophile, who reported with alarm that Romania risked being seduced and then engulfed by German culture.Boia, p.190-191 Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T. Vianu comments that Bogdan-Pite»ôti was probably unsuited for the task of introducing Bronzes, and that, despite expectations, the volume failed to impress the French public.Tudor Vianu, p.369, 371 He notes the virtually complete lack of press reviews‚Äîwith the notable exception of a May 1898 article in Mercure de France, written by the Symbolist-anarchist Pierre Quillard.Tudor Vianu, p.371 Later in 1898, back in Romania, Bogdan-Pite»ôti and the other Salonul Independen»õilor initiators joined up with author Ioan Bacalba»ôa and architect »òtefan Cioc√¢lteu. This diverse group established Societatea Ileana, an association dedicated to supporting innovative artists.Jianu & Comarnescu, p.40; Vianu, p.370. See also Ionescu, Mi»ôcarea..., p.240-248; Rus, p.79-80 Its steering committee was later joined by the intellectual and political figures Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru, Nicolae Xenopol, and Nicolae Filipescu, as well as by the painter Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The society took up the effort to uproot against academic salons, organizing a large and provocative exhibit in 1898, and, at the height of its popularity, enlisted in its ranks some 300 people.Ionescu, Mi»ôcarea..., p.240-242 Despite such consolidation, various Ileana affiliates were not entirely committed to the cause, and never severed their links with StƒÉnescu's official section.Ionescu, Mi»ôcarea..., p.240-248 The new circle held meetings in a Brezoianu Street studio which was also its patron's home.TeacƒÉ, p.54 Its feminine name Ileana was probably a borrowing from Romanian folklore, and may reference the fairy tale character Ileana Cos√¢nzeana. The group's press organ, also known as Ileana, was edited by Bacalba»ôa and illustrated by Luchian.Ionescu, Mi»ôcarea..., p.242; Lassaigne & Enescu, p.52-53, 105; Mitchievici, p.15 Described by Vianu as a \\"refined art magazine\\", it is also considered the first one of its kind in Romania.Cernat, Avangarda, p.43 In parallel, Bogdan-Pite»ôti began frequenting the country's first socialist pressure group, the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR), and attending meetings between Bucharest workers. The PSDMR denounced him as an agent provocateur of the Conservative Party, and he stood accused of breaking the party into tolerant and antisemitic halves.Ion C. Atanasiu, Pagini din istoria contimporanƒÉ a Rom√¢niei: 1881‚Äì1916. Vol. I: Mi»ôcarea socialistƒÉ: 1881‚Äì1900, Editura Adevƒïrul, Bucharest [n.y.], p.331-334 =P√©ladan's visit= Photograph of Bogdan-Pite»ôti (left) and Jos√©phin P√©ladan, during the latter's visit to Bucharest As head of Ileana, Bogdan- Pite»ôti organized Jos√©phin P√©ladan's 1898 visit to Bucharest.Cernat, Avangarda, p.42, 407; Mitchievici, p.71, 321, 327‚Äì337; TeacƒÉ, p.52; Tudor Vianu, p.370 It was a much-publicized event, which attracted the attention of high society and received ample coverage in the press; Bogdan-Pite»ôti accompanied P√©ladan on visits to various Bucharest landmarks, including the Athenaeum, the Chamber of Deputies, the Orthodox Metropolitan and Domni»õa BƒÉla»ôa churches, as well as the Roman Catholic Saint Joseph Cathedral.Cernat, Avangarda, p.42-43 Among the politicians who attended the ceremonies were Nicolae Filipescu, Constantin Dissescu, Take Ionescu, Ioan Lahovary, and Constantin C. Arion; prominent intellectuals (Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu Delavrancea, RƒÉdulescu-Motru etc.) were in the audience.Cernat, Avangarda, p.42-43; Mitchievici, p.331-334 P√©ladan agreed to lecture in front of Societatea Ileana at the Atheneum, and his subject of choice was The Genius of the Latin Race. His mystical doctrine was received with much skepticism and amusement by the Romanian literary chroniclers.Mitchievici, p.328-329, 331, 333‚Äì337 The visit then turned to scandal: P√©ladan issued a call for all Romanians to embrace Catholicism, and left the country on pain of being deported.\\"Cronologia della vita di Jos√©phin P√©ladan\\", in Marisa Verna, L'opera teatrale di Jos√©phin P√©ladan: esoterismo e magia nel dramma simbolista, Vita e Pensiero, Milan, 2000, p.18. . See also Mitchievici, p.334-336 Various commentators are entirely dismissive of the visit and its importance. Th. Enescu describes its impact as \\"amazing\\", since P√©ladan was merely an \\"unusual [funambulesc in the original] representative of French culture\\". He also proposes that the reception, with its \\"noisy\\" and \\"exacerbated\\" fanfare, shows the \\"complexes of a provincial culture, confronted with the promiscuous exorbitance of a great culture\\". This assessment is quoted by literary historian Paul Cernat, who also notes P√©ladan's \\"rather modest value\\" should not have allowed such reactions. Cernat concedes that the P√©ladan visit was important for promoting new cultural trends, specifically the notions of art for art's sake and decadence, even though this was done \\"through the means of politics [italics in the original]\\". Cultural historian Angelo Mitchievici proposes that, modelling himself on P√©ladan, Bogdan-Pite»ôti was becoming the \\"spinmeister\\" of oriental Symbolism.Mitchievici, p.337 As Ion Doican (or Duican), he contributed to Ileana essays praising various contemporary painters: Arthur Verona, George Demetrescu Mirea, and, most of all, Luchian.Rus, p.79-80 Ileana only published a few issues before closing down in 1901. Bogdan-Pite»ôti's collaborator Bacalba»ôa, known by then as a dramatist, also attended, but drifted away from the group in 1900, giving up his position as editor of Ileana.Lassaigne & Enescu, p.110 A similar split occurred between Luchian and his patron, sparked when Bogdan-Pite»ôti made some favorable comments on StƒÉncescu's work, and probably took several years to mend.Jianu & Comarnescu, p.44-46; Rus, p.80 Over that decade, Bogdan-Pite»ôti had also become one of Literatoruls main financial backers.Cernat, Avangarda, p.41 Writing in 1910, at a time when Romanian art came to be me more familiar with new artistic trends (including Cubism and Fauvism, both advocated locally by art critic Theodor Cornel),Cernat, Avangarda, p.45-46 Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti adapted his discourse to the new trends. The art patron, who probably exercised considerable influence over Cornel,TeacƒÉ, p.51 publicly complained that, instead of keeping up with the times, his fellow Romanian intellectuals still regarded Impressionism as the ultimate novelty.Cernat, Avangarda, p.46 On the occasion, he hailed the Post-Impressionist French artists Paul Gauguin and Paul C√©zanne as the models to follow. He was actively seeking to mend his split with Luchian, and, although he called the painter \\"inconsistent\\", again stated that he found him to be Romania's best young artist.Jianu & Comarnescu, p.243; Rus, p.80 =Slatina revolt and Vlaici colony= Nicolae Vermont's Vara la conac (\\"Summer at the Manor\\"), a 1912 depiction of Bogdan-Pite»ôti's estate After his return to Romania, Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti was still noted for his political activities, although these shifted to the background during his Ileana years. According to some reports, he spent some of his free time touring the countryside, rallying up peasants, inciting them to rebel, and mapping out a radical land reform. During the general election of 1899, he ran for a deputy seat in both Olt and Ilfov, without registering success.Cernat, Avangarda, p. 43; Jianu & Comarnescu, p. 46; Lassaigne & Enescu, p. 110 There was confusion as to Bogdan-Pite»ôti's political affiliation. He was known as \\"the peasants' candidate\\", but both sides of the Romanian two-party system, the National Liberal Party and the Conservative group, accused the other of secretly supporting his bid. \\"O jale in Rom√¢nia\\", in Tribuna Poporului, Nr. 114/1899, p. 2 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) During such campaigns, he is said to have misled his voters into believing that he was a son of the deposed Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, and therefore a natural champion of land reform.Cernat, Avangarda, p. 43; Mitchievici, p. 125, 338, 357 His activity in Olt is credited with having sparked some violent incidents: in at least one account, he instigated the peasants of Slatina area to riot, and their revolt was only suppressed with use of force.Lassaigne & Enescu, p.110; Mitchievici, p.338, 348 Others however claim that the Romanian Land Forces randomly shot at, then charged upon, the peaceful mass of demonstrators, killing at least 35 of them. The Slatina crisis reverberated in the capital and posed problems for the Conservative cabinet of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino. Reportedly, both the Minister of Agriculture Nicolae Fleva and the Minister of Justice Dissescu were ready to hand in their resignations. Bogdan-Pite»ôti himself was arrested for sedition, but soon after checked himself into Filantropia Hospital. He averted sentencing when the prosecutors were unable to conclusively prove this involvement.Jianu & Comarnescu, p.46; Mitchievici, p.338 Overall, Bogdan- Pite»ôti claimed to have been held in judicial custody for some forty separate incidents, stressing that all these convictions were owed to political crimes‚Äîwhile reporting this statement, T. Vianu noted that at least some should in fact be considered punishments for various misdemeanors. In time, the anarchist boyar had also come to be known as an inveterate criminal and jailbird, which attracted him the disparaging moniker Bogdan-VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti (after VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti prison in Bucharest). Others twisted his birth name into the parodic Bogdan-Ciupe»ôti (from a ciupi, \\"to gyp\\"). Simona Vasilache, \\"AlintƒÉri\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 26/2007 \\"Mangra la Bucure»ôti\\", in Rom√¢nul (Arad), Nr. 98/1914, p.5 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Bogdan-Pite»ôti consolidated his own estate when he inherited a manor in Vlaici village (part of Colone»ôti). It was, beginning in 1908, the center of his activities and home to his sizable art collection, as well as one of the first locations in Romania acting as a summer camp for painters and sculptors.Boia, p.190; Cernat, Avangarda, p.43Veronica Marinescu, \\"Conacul de la Vlaici al colec»õionarului Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti, √Æntr-o stare jalnicƒÉ\\", in Curierul Na»õional, August 12, 2004 The events he planned were attended by the Ileana regulars, and, in time, attracted virtually all other major en plein air painters of the day: Nicolae DƒÉrƒÉscu, »òtefan Dimitrescu, Iosif Iser, M. H. Maxy, Theodor Pallady, Camil Ressu. In his recollections from that period, writer Victor Eftimiu suggested that the relationship was not entirely harmonious: \\"Camil Ressu, like other young unknown painters, found a lot of support and encouragement with Bogdan-Pite»ôti. Truth be told, the maecenate was rather thrifty, it profited from the needs of the debuting and impoverished artist. But without it things would've been much worse, since others did not even offer as much\\". He also argued that, contrary to speculation about his wealth, Bogdan-Pite»ôti \\"maybe paid up so little because that is all he had to spare\\".TeacƒÉ, p. 57 Reputedly, the Ileana boss was losing a fortune on maintaining the Vlaici manor, surrounded as it was by barren land.Mitchievici, p. 343 =»òtirbey-VodƒÉ circle= Circa 1908, the Bogdan-Pite»ôti villa on Bucharest's »òtirbey-VodƒÉ Street (near the Ci»ômigiu Gardens) began hosting regular gatherings of intellectuals. Among those who attended in successive stages were the writers Macedonski, Eftimiu, Tudor Arghezi, Mateiu Caragiale, Benjamin Fondane, Gala Galaction, George Bacovia, Ion Minulescu, Claudia Millian, N. D. Cocea, Ion Vinea, F. Brunea-Fox, Eugeniu »òtefƒÉnescu-Est, A. de Herz, Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru, and Adrian Maniu.Cernat, Avangarda, p.34, 39, 44. See also Boia, p.189-190; Mitchievici, p.339-357 It also hosted the artists Luchian, Artachino, Verona, Maxy, Iser, Steriadi, Dimitrescu, Pallady, Ressu, DƒÉrƒÉscu, Nina Arbore, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Constantin Medrea, Dimitrie Paciurea, Maria Ciurdea Steurer, Oscar Han, Nicolae Tonitza, Ion Theodorescu-Sion, Friedrich Storck and Cecilia Cu»õescu-Storck, as well as Abgar Baltazar, Alexandru BrƒÉtƒÉ»ôanu, Alexandru Poitevin-Skeletti, George Demetrescu Mirea, Rodica Maniu, and Marcel Janco.Cernat, Avangarda, p.39, 44. See also Mitchievici, p.339, 354‚Äì357; TeacƒÉ, passim Also in 1908, following Iser's proposal, Bogdan-Pite»ôti sponsored a Bucharest exhibit showcasing works by the renowned European painters Demetrios Galanis, Jean-Louis Forain and Andr√© Derain.Cernat, Avangarda, p.407 After 1910, his patronage took on new forms. Literary critic »òerban Cioculescu notes that, at least initially, his relationship with Mateiu Caragiale included a financial aspect, since Bogdan- Pite»ôti inviting the destitute poet to dinner and provided him with funds.»ò. Cioculescu, p.369 He was also granting lodging and material to various disadvantaged painters, as reported by his close friend Arghezi, and took a special interest in promoting the poetry of »òtefan PeticƒÉ (as well as that of Arghezi himself). Arghezi claimed that such influence and moral support were also \\"decisive\\" in at least one other case, that of Luchian. In his memoir of the period, linguist Alexandru Rosetti mentioned that, on a daily basis, Bogdan-Pite»ôti invited \\"over a dozen artists\\" for supper at his home. Alexandru Rosetti, \\"Tudor Arghezi\\", in Cronica Rom√¢nƒÉ, April 8, 2004 Bogdan- Pite»ôti's renewed his attacks on the Orthodox Church. Paul Cernat sees them as efforts to fabricate a religious alternative to the Orthodox mainstream, included in the larger phenomenon that was Symbolist cosmopolitanism.Cernat, Avangarda, p.17 However, Galaction, who was to end his life as an Orthodox priest, recorded that the »òtirbey-VodƒÉ circle accommodated people of very diverse backgrounds. At one time, they included, alongside Galaction himself, the Roman Catholic priest Carol Auner, the Protestant sculptor Storck, and the anarchist activist Panait Mu»ôoiu.Boia, p.189; Cernat, Avangarda, p.44 According to Cernat, Bogdan-Pite»ôti's bohemian society also grouped people believed associated with the illegal activities, and was noted for its \\"libertine\\" atmosphere.Cernat, Avangarda, p.39, 43 Galaction backed such interpretations, writing that the salon was also home to \\"a dozen con artists and prostitutes.\\"Boia, p.190; Cernat, Avangarda, p.44 The atmosphere was colloquial and free-spirited, to the point of being demeaning: story goes that the artists and writers were sometimes told licentious jokes, or had to endure grotesque farces.Mitchievici, p.341, 344, 345, 349, 351, 354; TeacƒÉ, p.54 A dandy, Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti himself led a life of luxury, marked by excess, and had by then become a drug addict. Andrei Oi»ôteanu, \\"Scriitorii rom√¢ni »ôi narcoticele (5). Prima jumƒÉtate a secolului XX\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 951, May‚ÄìJune 2008 He was a proud homosexual (or bisexual), which did not prevent him from keeping as his concubine a younger woman, commonly referred to as Domnica (\\"Little Lady\\") or Mica (\\"Little One\\").Cernat, Avangarda, p.43; TeacƒÉ, p.55-56, 58. See also Boia, p.189 Born Alexandra Colanoski, she was born in 1894 to Romanian Poles from Bessarabia,TeacƒÉ, p.58 and, according to memoirist Constantin Beldie, had previously been a prostitute at a nightclub. Herself a libertine, Domnica was described by researchers as an androgynous or cross-dressing presence.Cernat, Avangarda, p.44; Mitchievici, p.341, 346‚Äì347; TeacƒÉ, p.55 To other members of the »òtirbey-VodƒÉ circle, painter-designer Alexandru BrƒÉtƒÉ»ôanu was introduced as Bogdan-Pite»ôti's male lover. Theirs was a \\"degenerate\\" affair, according to Oscar Han; Han also quotes Bogdan- Pite»ôti's admiration for the male body, including male genitalia, as the only physical beauties which could withstand time.TeacƒÉ, p.55-56, 58 =Cantacuzino Conservative and Seara= Title page of Seara, with portraits of candidates in the 1914 election; Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino's is first on the left Around 1912, Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti's political influence was on the rise. He had begun associating with an inner faction of the Conservative Party, which had as its leader Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest.»ò. Cioculescu, p.378; Rusu Abrudeanu, p.109 Afterward, Bogdan-Pite»ôti became the publisher of Seara, but was reportedly a front for Cantacuzino, who used him to test the impact of his agenda on the Romanian public.Boia, p.94, 191; Mitchievici, p.340-341; Reneti, p.36; Rusu Abrudeanu, p.109-110 Searas main negative campaign at the time focused on Take Ionescu and his Conservative- Democrats, who, to Cantacuzino's displeasure, had been co-opted in government by the other mainstream Conservatives. Barbu Cioculescu, \\"Din via»õa lui Mateiu I. Caragiale: »òeful de cabinet\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 14/2001 The paper published gossip columns and lampoons having Ionescu, Alexandru BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu and Nicolae Titulescu for their main targets. By then, like many \\"Germanophile\\" Conservatives, Bogdan-Pite»ôti had come to support the Romanian Kingdom's alliance with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. This view was popularized by means of his literary club, and support for the Central Powers was also voiced by Arghezi at Seara.Boia, p.94, 147, 191‚Äì194; Cernat, Avangarda, p.39, 41 In September 1914, a German consortium purchased the paper (together with Cantacuzino's other gazette, Minerva), and Bogdan-Pite»ôti was kept on as a simple columnist.Boia, p.94, 191, 194. See also Reneti, p.36, 38; Rusu Abrudeanu, p.109-110, 487‚Äì488 Throughout the interval, Bogdan-Pite»ôti was himself an outspoken Germanophile. His circle, which was already hostile to the National Liberal cabinet of Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu, welcomed the diverse groups who were alarmed by Romania's probable entry into the war: the pro- German Conservatives, the supporters of proletarian internationalism, and the committed pacifists.Cernat, Avangarda, p.39-40 The artistic clientele was also represented in the Germanophile group at large, but, Cernat's writes, did so for sheer dependency rather than actual convictions.Cernat, Avangarda, p.40 Suspicions soon arose that Bogdan-Pite»ôti had become a veritable agent of influence. According to Zambaccian, it was Bogdan-Pite»ôti who actually dropped a hint that his support for Germany was a lucrative employment. Through various notes in scattered diaries, most of which have been lost, Caragiale reputedly accused Bogdan-Pite»ôti taking Germany's money to promote her interests in Romania, and to assist her foreign propaganda effort.Boia, p.194; Mitchievici, p.340-342; »ò. Cioculescu, p.376 Such assessments, like Caragiale's allegation that Bogdan-Pite»ôti was not knowledgeable in art, reflected conflicts between the two figures, and their overall reliability remains doubtful. Paul Cernat, \\"De la Barbu Cioculescu citire\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 319, May 2006Mitchievici, p.340-343 It is however possible that Caragiale himself borrowed, and never returned, some 10,000 lei, siphoned out of the German propaganda funds by Bogdan-Pite»ôti.Boia, p.203 =Libertatea and propaganda wars= Between October 1915 and June 1916, Bogdan-Pite»ôti managed another press venue, Libertatea (\\"Freedom\\"). Its political director was retired statesman Nicolae Fleva, later replaced by Arghezi.Boia, p.94, 147, 194. See also Rusu Abrudeanu, p.113-114, 485 In February 1916, Galaction and Arghezi launched Cronica, another review with a pro-German agenda, and which may itself have been published with discreet assistance from Bogdan- Pite»ôti.Boia, p.194; Mitchievici, p.339; C. Popescu-Cadem, \\"Document √Æn replicƒÉ\\", Mihail Sadoveanu City Library, Bucharest, 2007, p.217. Although Bogdan-Pite»ôti, Domnica and Caragiale paid a mysterious visit to Berlin in early 1916, they were never listed as foreign spies by Siguran»õa Statului counter-intelligence.Boia, p.193, 203 Bogdan-Pite»ôti's name then surfaced in a February 1916 conversation between German statesman Matthias Erzberger and Raymund Netzhammer, the Catholic Archbishop of Bucharest. Erzberger asked if the Vlaici landowner could ever help advance the Germanophile cause; the Archbishop, a loyal German subject, replied that Bogdan-Pite»ôti was unreliable.Boia, p.193 Allegations later surfaced that Bogdan-Pite»ôti was one of the men receiving payoffs from the German spy Albert E. G√ºnther, manager of Steaua Rom√¢nƒÉ company. The dossier attesting this was lost, but secondary sources have it that Bogdan-Pite»ôti alone received 840,000 lei from G√ºnther's hands.Boia, p.193-194. See also Rusu Abrudeanu, p.485-486 The contributors to Seara and Libertatea were, in general, outspoken social and cultural critics, with diverse grievances against the establishment. Historian Lucian Boia argues that, even though Bogdan-Pite»ôti was on the German payroll, his switch from the Francophiles could have been a genuine form of conservatism.Boia, p.191-192 Boia thus notes that Seara was supportive of the Central Powers from the 1914 build-up to the war, that is even before Cantacuzino had come to decide which side he liked best.Boia, p.192 The core group of Seara men included socialists of various hues: Arghezi, who claimed that Serbian nationalism was the spark of the war; Felix Aderca, who depicted the German Empire as the more progressive belligerent; and Rodion, who rendered the complains of Germanophile intellectuals from Moldavia.Boia, p.120, 134‚Äì135, 148‚Äì149, 318 Others were left-wing refugees from the Russian Empire, who wanted Romania to join the Central Powers and help liberate Bessarabia: Alexis Nour, from the Poporanist faction, and the old anarchist Zamfir Arbore.Boia, p.145, 259 Seara was also a platform for some disgruntled Romanians from Transylvania region, a Romanian irredenta under Austro-Hungarian rule. They included a mainstream Conservative commentator, Ilie BƒÉrbulescu, who advised Romanians to not to focus on Transylvania, and prioritized action against the Russians.Boia, p.94-95 Two distinct voices were those of poet Dumitru Karnabatt, who identified the Entente Powers with Pan-Slavism or British imperialism; and Ion Gorun, the Transylvanian writer and Habsburg loyalist.Boia, p.229-230, 240‚Äì241 Beyond politics, Seara came out with news on culture, selected for publishing by Ion Vinea and poet Jacques G. Costin.Cernat, Avangarda, p.34, 188 The left-wing preoccupations were also an important feature of Libertatea. Its opening manifesto called for a large- scale social reform, which it claimed was more important to Romanians than any National Liberal project to recover Transylvania from its Austro-Hungarian overlord.Boia, p.94 It enlisted contributions, generally less political than those at Seara, from literary figures such as Vinea, Demostene Botez, I. Dragoslav, Adrian Maniu and I. C. Vissarion.Boia, p.103 Bogdan-Pite»ôti regularly published his own articles in the two newspapers he directed, signing them with the pseudonym Al. Dodan. The early texts express his Russophobia and commiseration over France's alliance with Tsarist autocracy, the world's \\"most savage, most ignorant and bloodiest oligarchy\\". By 1915, assessing that Romania's national interest rested with the Habsburgs and the Germans, and arguing that Romanian peasants were worse off than their counterparts in Transylvania, he was urging his countrymen to ponder the benefits of Bessarabia's annexation to Romania.Boia, p.192-193 =Wartime, disgrace and death= The neutrality years also rekindled controversy over Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti's daily affairs. A scandal erupted in 1913, after banker Aristide Blank brought Bogdan-Pite»ôti to court on charges of blackmail. The plaintiff enlisted the services of lawyer Take Ionescu, and the defendant, represented by Fleva,Rusu Abrudeanu, p.114 was ultimately sentenced to a jail term. Throughout the scandal, Seara hosted articles by Arghezi, professing Bogdan-Pite»ôti's innocence. In 1916, just before Romania entered the war as an Entente country, Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti was again involved in a legal dispute with the Francophiles Take Ionescu and Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu-Delavrancea, with Constantin Dissescu as his lawyer.Octavian Goga, \\"1916. Din zilele rƒÉzboiului nostru\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1997 The Ententist bid resulted in major initial defeats, and a Romanian theater of war was opened. The country suffered heavily, and Bucharest was taken by the Central Powers. Reputedly, the occupation forces picked up Bogdan-Pite»ôti from his cell at VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti, where he was still serving time. Like Arghezi, Macedonski, Galaction and Mateiu Caragiale, he remained in German-occupied territory. Despite his apparent triumph over the Ententist lobby, he kept a low profile: according to popular but unverifiable rumors, he was even arrested once the occupation authorities angrily discovered his uselessness for the cause.Boia, p.194-195. See also Cernat, Avangarda, p.45 He was however a free man as of April 12, 1917, the date of his marriage to Domnica Colanoski. One account has it that Bogdan-Pite»ôti proceeded to denounce his Ileana colleague, Petrescu GƒÉinƒÉ, who had published a set of anti-German cartoons. As a result, the Romanian draftsman spent the war years in German captivity.Mitchievici, p.348-349 Once Romania recovered possession over its southern areas, Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti was reportedly prosecuted for treason and was again sent to VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti.Cernat, Avangarda, p.39 Others however note that this last sentence, passed in 1919, was not in fact related to his wartime dealings, but merely to his fraudulent activities, and that only by coincidence did Bogdan-Pite»ôti share a prison with the convicted collaborationist journalists (Arghezi, Karnabatt, Ioan Slavici).Boia, p.342 T. Vianu notes that Bogdan-Pite»ôti spent his last years \\"in ignominy\\", while Cernat describes his definitive fall to the status of \\"a pariah\\". The art promoter died four years after the war ended, at his house in Bucharest, having suffered a myocardial infarction. According to Cernat, his \\"grotesque\\" death was sudden, catching him in the middle of a telephone conversation. Reportedly, Bogdan-Pite»ôti's last wish had been for his collection to pass into state property and be kept as a museum. Legacy =Role and influence= Bogdan-Pite»ôti was the subject of fascination in the literary and artistic community. Lucian Boia writes about his seductive \\"legend\\", which fused an \\"imaginative and generous intellectual\\" with a \\"con artist\\" who \\"lived life as he saw fit\\". Art historian Corina TeacƒÉ notes that, like F√©lix F√©n√©on, Bogdan-Pite»ôti was in fact fabricating his own myth: \\"every part of his public image was a removable mask.\\" The art institutions he helped establish were, nevertheless, reputable. According to Paul Cernat, his influential circle was \\"an excellent medium of transmission for the modern spirit, an informal institution and one of the first coagulant factors for [Romania's] first post-symbolist modernism.\\"Cernat, Avangarda, p.44 Writing earlier, Theodor Enescu proposed that, like own group, the »òtirbey-VodƒÉ Street salon and Macedonski's circle were the only trend-setters active between the decline of Junimea society (ca. 1900) and the establishment of the modernist literature magazine SburƒÉtorul (1919). Cernat additionally notes that, while the writer Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti was \\"neglectful and improvident\\" when it came to preserving his own works, those essays and prose poems that survived have a genuine value. Such judgments were also passed on his topical art essays. Art historian Petru Comarnescu writes that Bogdan- Pite»ôti's \\"critical intuitions\\" were superior to those of fellow collectors Zambaccian and Ioan Kalinderu;Cernat, Avangarda, p.45 critic Nicolae Oprescu also assesses that, without Bogdan-Pite»ôti, »òtefan Luchian would be lost to Romanian art. The Romanian art environment cherished, then despised, its anarchist patron. In his moments of glory, he received homages from many of his writer friends, as notebooks and albums compiled especially for him. Cornel Ungureanu, \\"Ion Vinea »ôi iubirile paralele ale poe»õilor\\", in Orizont, Nr. 5/2007, p.2 At a later date, all sides of the dispute were united in expressing criticism for at least some of Bogdan-Pite»ôti's deeds. According to Galaction, he was a \\"hajduk\\", who \\"robbed away and gave away.\\"Boia, p.190 Zambaccian portrayed him as one \\"created from a mold in which the evil and the good genius were present in equal measure. [...] Cynical and suave, generous on one side, a con artist on the other, Al. Bogdan-Pite»ôti relished the abjection that he served with cynicism\\". As TeacƒÉ notes, both Zambaccian and sculptor Oscar Han were among those forever \\"seduced\\" by Bogdan-Pite»ôti's duplicity. In 1970, Han wrote: \\"we cannot judge [him] under common law. He remains an absurdity.\\" While nationalist journalist Pamfil »òeicaru dismissed him as \\"a scoundrel\\", Macedonski argued that Bogdan-Pite»ôti was \\"a wonderful prose writer and an admirable poet\\". Benjamin Fondane, the modernist poet- philosopher, praised Bogdan-Pite»ôti as a man of exquisite taste, concluding that: \\"He was made of the greatest of joys, in the most purulent of bodies. How many generations of ancient boyars had come to pass, like unworthy dung, for this singular earth to be generated?\\"Cernat, Avangarda, p.44; Mitchievici, p.356 Writer and critic Eugen Lovinescu, also a modernist, was bitterly opposed to the views of Bogdan-Pite»ôti and most other intellectuals who sided with Germany: in 1922, he published the article Revizuiri morale (\\"Moral Revisions\\"), which reminded the public about the controversy surrounding the art collector and his associates (Arghezi, N. D. Cocea).Cernat, Avangarda, p.39; Mitchievici, p.356 A socialist acquaintance and an oral historian, Constantin Bacalba»ôa was convinced that Bogdan-Pite»ôti was the prototype \\"inferior degenerate\\" and, in his political life, a manipulator of \\"the uncultured minds.\\"Mitchievici, p.338 Retrospective criticism of Bogdan-Pite»ôti was also voiced by Comarnescu and co-author Ionel Jianu. Although they pay homage to Bogdan-Pite»ôti's artistic qualities, the two speak of his \\"reproachable faults\\" and \\"con artist coups\\", finding in him \\"an exhibitionist determined to trick and scandalize\\", or an \\"enfant terrible\\".Jianu & Comarnescu, p.34-35 Commentators have been tempted to compare Bogdan-Pite»ôti with some controversial characters in world history, most often the prototype of self-seekers, Alcibiades.Cernat, Avangarda, p.44; Mitchievici, p.355; TeacƒÉ, p.54 Others likened Bogdan-Pite»ôti to the Renaissance writer and notorious blackmailer Pietro Aretino (Zambaccian stresses that, unlike Aretino, Bogdan-Pite»ôti never duped his artists). Comarnescu proposed that Bogdan-Pite»ôti and the equally controversial Arghezi were better understood through the logic of Hinduism (\\"the ancient Indian ethics\\"): \\"good and evil are not opposed, but collocated, combined, in a state of confusion\\". Taking in view Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti's preference for orality, his shady political connections, and his mostly informal channels of influence, Cernat concluded that, \\"the necessary changes having been made\\", one could compare Bogdan- Pite»ôti with Nae Ionescu, a philosopher and far right activist whose career spanned the interwar period, and who had also debuted as a Symbolist.Cernat, Avangarda, p.40-41 =Anecdotes= Caricature of Bogdan-Pite»ôti looking over nudes, dressed in cassock (Nicolae Petrescu-GƒÉinƒÉ, 1913) Several anecdotes concerning Bogdan-Pite»ôti's morals and extravagant lifestyle were in circulation from his lifetime. In 1912, Macedonski published an autobiographical Christmas story. It tells how, inspired by Macedonski's desire to feed his family a traditional turkey feast, Bogdan-Pite»ôti sent him the bird stuffed with 50 gold lei. As T. Vianu writes, such \\"attitudes of a grand feudal lord\\" made Bogdan-Pite»ôti into an \\"indisputably picturesque\\" person. The account was partly confirmed by Constantin Beldie, who also noted that, during those years, Alexandru Macedonski was \\"starving\\" and had to provide for \\"a house full of children\\". Zambaccian however cites a contrasting story once told by actor Ion Iancovescu. It suggests that, during the wartime famine, Macedonski asked Bogdan-Pite»ôti to pay him 1 million lei for one of the few surviving copies of Bronzes; Bogdan-Pite»ôti bluntly offered him 5 lei‚ÄîMacedonski gave in, commenting that \\"he is capable of changing his mind, that con artist!\\" Bogdan-Pite»ôti's mood swings were also discussed by memoirist Radu D. Rosetti. He writes that the boyar scarcely minded when his fortune was being siphoned away by some members of his retinue, but that he publicly humiliated Galaction, and even Domnica, over random expenses. The relationship between Mateiu Caragiale and his one-time patron has attracted special interest from period historians. Early on, the aspiring poet wrote a special piece in honor of his senior friend‚Äîcalled DregƒÉtorul (\\"The Mandarin\\"), it is included in one of Bogdan-Pite»ôti's albums. That accord degenerated during the late 1910s, to the point where Caragiale, whose diary spoke of Bogdan-Pite»ôti's homosexuality in dismissive terms (calling him \\"a blusterer of the anti-natural vice\\"), laid out a plan to loot the »òtirbey-VodƒÉ Street villa.Mitchievici, p.340, 341‚Äì342; Ion Vianu, \\"O plimbare pe Strada Matei Caragiale\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 840, April 2006 According to the same author, Bogdan-Pite»ôti turned to passive homosexuality because he was impotent.TeacƒÉ, p.55, 58 Caragiale's diary also sketched a portrait of Domnica Bogdan, questioning her morality in harsh terms.Boia, p.198, 203; Cernat, Avangarda, p.44; Mitchievici, p.340, 341 Bogdan-Pite»ôti's other relationships with his other prot√©g√©s could also fluctuate between extremes. According to an anecdote of the time, he advanced Luchian a large sum of money, which the painter used for a trip to Sinaia. Luchian then upset Bogdan-Pite»ôti by not inviting him over, and was punished with a telegram addressed \\"To the ugliest tourist in Sinaia\\" (a pun on Luchian's proverbial bad looks).»ò. Cioculescu, p.114-115 In the mid-1910s, Luchian had been incapacitated by multiple sclerosis. Bogdan-Pite»ôti was one of the last to visit him before his death in June 1916, recording for posterity Luchian's resigned remark: \\"I'm going away\\".Lassaigne & Enescu, p.90 The main first-hand account of Bogdan-Pite»ôti's 1919 imprisonment comes from Ioan Slavici's √énchisorile mele (\\"My Prisons\\"). According to Slavici, the art patron had a luxury cell with a view over Bucharest. Alexandru Rosetti, citing Arghezi, records one of Bogdan-Pite»ôti's witticisms on the issue of prison life. When a Gendarme wrongly attempted to push him into Arghezi's line of suspected traitors, Bogdan-Pite»ôti snapped: Pardon, eu sunt escroc! (\\"Pardon me, [but] I'm a con artist!\\"). Zambaccian writes that, during the first of his legal battles with Take Ionescu, Bogdan- Pite»ôti commented on Ionescu's deposition: \\"He sure is talented, that crook!\\" The pro-Entente nationalist Octavian Goga was especially upset by Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti's stances, and, in his record of 1916 events (including the Ionescu trial), wrote him off as a \\"bandit\\" fed with \\"German money\\". =Fictional character= After the World War, according to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pite»ôti to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who looked into the mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty \\"henchmen\\". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pite»ôti replies: \\"I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For how is it that you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?\\" According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pite»ôti directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pite»ôti's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: \\"Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself.\\"Boia, p.195 Duca concludes: \\"this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pite»ôti's life.\\" Despite their relationship having declined from friendship to hatred, Bogdan-Pite»ôti's style and his mundane interests are occasionally seen as sources of inspiration for Caragiale's only novel, Craii de Curtea-Veche (completed in 1928). Some have noted that Bogdan-Pite»ôti has a lot in common with at least one of the three protagonists.Mitchievici, p.341 He and his wife were both characters in Ion Vinea's novels Venin de mai (\\"May Venom\\") and Lunatecii (\\"The Lunatics\\")‚ÄîAlexandru as Adam GunƒÉ, Domnica as wife Iada GunƒÉ.Cernat, Avangarda, p.41, 43; Mitchievici, p.339, 343, 344‚Äì351, 354 Both novels portray the Bogdans' cultural circle, allude to their influence in making young people reject all conventionalism, and show them promoting vice as virtue. This lifestyle has taken its toll on Adam GunƒÉ, who is a physical ruin and slowly loses his hold on reality.Mitchievici, p.345-348 Vinea's books repeat claims that Bogdan-Pite»ôti was abusing drugs, and that Domnica was originally a prostitute. More fiction work dealing with the Bogdan-Pite»ôti circle was published from a casual contributor to Seara, Lucrezzia Karnabatt. In her 1922 novel, Demoniaca, she portrays her employer as \\"Basile Dan\\", a sinister traitor of his country and a cynical pornographer.Mitchievici, p.340-341, 351‚Äì354, 355, 497 Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru used Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti as the inspiration for \\"Alexandru LƒÉpu»ôneanu\\", the boyar character in his novel Don Juan Coco»ôatul (\\"Don Juan the Hunchback\\").Cernat, Avangarda, p.41; Mitchievici, p.339, 343‚Äì344, 354George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne de la origini p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1986, p.796 Literary historian George CƒÉlinescu notes that this fictional portrait shows: \\"The dignity in gossip, the boyar carriage, the refinement that the apparent vulgarity cannot bring to ruin, the blas√© and cynical lechery [...].\\" In one episode in the book, LƒÉpu»ôneanu simulates agony and receives a Catholic confession that (he insists) must be read in Latin instead of French; elsewhere, LƒÉpu»ôneanu's eccentric and adulterous wife Feti»õa (\\"Little Girl\\") shows up on a battlefield, wearing nothing more than a swimsuit. Tudor Arghezi dedicated Bogdan-Pite»ôti some of his first poetry writings. As art critics, Arghezi and Theodor Cornel published a comprehensive biographical study on their patron (part of their Figuri contimporane din Rom√¢nia dictionary, 1909).Boia, p.189. See also TeacƒÉ, p.51, 52, 56 However, according to Corina TeacƒÉ, the encomium-like and conveniently imprecise entry may have been sent in, or at least approved of, by Bogdan-Pite»ôti.TeacƒÉ, p.51-52 Arghezi also made his sponsor the hero of a small eponymous poem, wherein he is called Lombard bastard cu ochi de rouƒÉ (\\"bastard Lombard with the eyes of dew\\"). =Collection and estate= »òtefan Luchian's LƒÉutul (\\"Washing the Hair\\"), one of the best known paintings in Bogdan-Pite»ôti's collection By the 1910s, Bogdan-Pite»ôti's art interests gave birth to a collection of as few as 967 or as many as 1,500 individual works, most of them hosted by his estate in Colone»ôti. They comprised objects created by prominent Romanian visual artists, including, alongside his early associates, Nina Arbore, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Oscar Han, Aurel Jiquidi, Maria Ciurdea Steurer, Constantin Medrea, Ary Murnu, Dimitrie Paciurea, Nicolae Petrescu-GƒÉinƒÉ, Alexandru Satmari, Francisc »òirato, Cecilia Cu»õescu-Storck, Jean Alexandru Steriadi, Friedrich Storck, Ion Theodorescu-Sion, and Nicolae Tonitza. Of the total, around 900 works were of Romanian provenance. Among the foreign artists whose work was featured in the collection were Georges Rochegrosse and Frank Brangwyn. The section dedicated to newer works of art was designed and opened as the first the modern art museum in Romania. The Bogdan-Pite»ôti trust included many samples of Luchian's art. Two of his famous paintings featured there were LƒÉutul (\\"Washing the Hair\\")‚Äîwhich Bogdan-Pite»ôti is said to have likened to the luminous oil paintings of Paolo Veronese, and Safta FlorƒÉreasa (\\"Safta the Flower Girl\\")‚Äîoriginally part of the Luchian family collection. Also included was the 1907 oil portrait of Luchian's cousin, Alecu Literatu (\\"Alecu the Literary Man\\").Lassaigne & Enescu, p.112 They were accompanied by the 1906 pastel Durerea (\\"Pain\\"), which had been reproduced in a 1914 issue of Seara, and by the paintings De NƒÉmezi (\\"Lunchtime\\") and Lica, feti»õa cu portocala (\\"Lica, the Girl with the Orange\\").Lassaigne & Enescu, p.112, 115 Among the works in the series were two portraits of Bogdan-Pite»ôti: an ink drawing, copies of which were circulated with Bogdan-Pite»ôti's election manifesto of 1899, and a since-lost oil painting.Lassaigne & Enescu, p.28, 110 Bogdan- Pite»ôti was the subject of several anonymous sketches, including two 1896 vignettes, published in AdevƒÉrul, and a 1917 drawing signed Correggio.Ionescu, Mi»ôcarea..., p.226, 231, 233 He is also depicted in an affectionate cartoon published in 1914 by Petrescu GƒÉinƒÉ.Paul Rezeanu, \\"Caricaturistul N.S. Petrescu-GƒÉinƒÉ\\", in Magazin Istoric, August 2008, p.62 Domnica Bogdan herself sat as a model for various artists, and was notably depicted in works by Camil Ressu, Pallady and the Bulgarian-born painter Pascin.Cernat, Avangarda, p.44; Mitchievici, p.356-357 In 1920, Bogdan-Pite»ôti commissioned Paciurea to complete a portrait bust of Domnica. The same year, Dimitrescu painted her an oil-on-cardboard portrait in dominant shades of brown (with touches of red and gray).Claudiu Paradaiser, »òtefan Dimitrescu, monografie, Editura Meridiane, Bucharest, 1978, p.15, 37, 42. Artists who illustrated works by Bogdan- Pite»ôti include, in addition to himself, George Demetrescu Mirea, Ion Georgescu and Satmari. The Colone»ôti manor and its art fund fell victim to neglect. According to T. Vianu, the collection was \\"blown over by the wind of devastation\\" even during the interwar years. In 1924, in defiance of its owner's final request, it was subject to a hasty public auction.Jianu & Comarnescu, p.88; Lassaigne & Enescu, p.110; TeacƒÉ, p.57 This drew protests from literary figures such as Cezar Petrescu,Jianu & Comarnescu, p.88 Perpessicius and Victor Eftimiu. As a result of the auction, many works passed into the collections of Zambaccian, Alexandru G. Florescu, Iosif Dona and several others. Of them, Zambaccian attributed the incident to the National Liberal government's unwillingness to accept donations from \\"a compromised person\\". He and several other commentators place responsibility for the sales on Finance Minister Ion Lapedatu, who is believed to have either hesitated in assessing the collection or to have plotted with businessmen who wanted it sold cheaply. Zambaccian was to be the eventual owner of LƒÉutul. It became a feature of his own Bucharest museum, and appears with Zambaccian in an oil portrait by Pallady.Lassaigne & Enescu, p.115 Under the communist regime, the Vlaici building was transformed into a branch for the state-owned producer of agricultural machinery, and, in 2004, belonged to its successor, Agromec (although still largely unused). Beldie recounts that, under communism, the destitute Domnica Bogdan worked as a hygienist at Bucharest Central Hospital. Notes References *Lucian Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\".

Symptoms include postpartum bleeding, abdominal pain, a mass in the vagina, and low blood pressure. Rarely inversion may occur not in association with pregnancy. Risk factors include pulling on the umbilical cord or pushing on the top of the uterus before the placenta has detached. Other risk factors include uterine atony, placenta previa, and connective tissue disorders. Diagnosis is by seeing the inside of the uterus either in or coming out of the vagina. Treatment involves standard resuscitation together with replacing the uterus as rapidly as possible. If efforts at manual replacement are not successful surgery is required. After the uterus is replaced oxytocin and antibiotics are typically recommended. The placenta can then be removed if it is still attached. Uterine inversion occurs in about 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 10,000 deliveries. Rates are higher in the developing world. The risk of death of the mother is about 15% while historically it has been as high as 80%. The condition has been described since at least 300 BC by Hippocrates. Signs and symptoms Drawing of an inverted uterus Uterine inversion is often associated with significant postpartum bleeding. Traditionally it was thought that it presented with haemodynamic shock \\"out of proportion\\" with blood loss, however blood loss has often been underestimated. The parasympathetic effect of traction on the uterine ligaments may cause bradycardia. Causes The most common cause is the mismanagement of 3rd stage of labor, such as: * Fundal pressure * Excess cord traction during the 3rd stage of labor Other natural causes can be: * Uterine weakness, congenital or not * Precipitate delivery * Short umbilical cord It is more common in multiple gestation than in singleton pregnancies. =Associations= * Placenta praevia * Fundal Placental Implantation * Use of Magnesium Sulfate * Vigorous fundal pressure * Repeated cord traction * short umbilical cord Types Incomplete (left) and complete (right) inversion of the uterus *One: Complete.

This work described equine and elephant anatomy, physiology, surgery and diseases with their curative and preventive measures. It elaborated on the body structures of different races of horses, and identified the structural details by which one can determine the age of a horse. Two other works, namely Asva-prashnsa and Asva-lakshana sastram are also attributed to Shalihotra. Some of the later authors have named their veterinary works after Shalihotra and others have based their work on his Samhita. Subsequent generations copied, revised and added to Shalihotra's text‚Äîone of these later texts is shown in the illustration above. Hence, the term \\"Shalihotra\\" refers to similar texts in a tradition. Muni Palkapya wrote Hasti Ayurveda, covering all aspects of elephant medicine. This book has four sections and 152 chapters, including the anatomy of elephants. During Mahabharat period, Nakul, author of the Ashva-chikitsa, was considered an equine expert, while Sahdev was a specialist in cattle management. Horses and elephants were vital assets in the never-ending warfare of the ancient world. Physicians treating human beings were also trained in the care of animals. Ancient Indian medical treatises such as those of Charaka, Sushruta and Harita contain chapters or references about the care of diseased, as well as healthy, animals. Author Shalihotra and the sage Agnivesa may have been pupils of the same teacher; according to tradition, Bharadwaja's Ayurveda, the science of life, was first presented in text form by Agnivesa, in his book the Agnivesh tantra and later by Charaka (Charaka Samhita, encyclopedia of the physician Charaka). Others assert the great surgeon Acharya Sushruta, author of Sushruta Samhita (encyclopedia of the physician Sushruta), may have been Shalihotra's pupil.\\"Ayurveda: Medical Practice\\", A Concise History of Science, Atma Ram & Sons  See also  * Ayurveda * History of veterinary medicine * Hippiatrica * History of the horse in South Asia References Literature * Apte, M.

It is most commonly caused by an imperforate hymen or a transverse vaginal septum. Signs and symptoms Hematometra typically presents as cyclic, cramping pain in the midline of the pelvis or lower abdomen. Patients may also report urinary frequency and urinary retention. Premenopausal women with hematometra often experience abnormal vaginal bleeding, including dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) or amenorrhea (lack of menstruation), while postmenopausal women are more likely to be asymptomatic. Due to the accumulation of blood in the uterus, patients may develop low blood pressure or a vasovagal response. When palpated, the uterus will typically feel firm and enlarged. Pathophysiology Hematometra develops when the uterus becomes distended with blood secondary to obstruction or atresia of the lower reproductive tract‚Äîthe uterus, cervix or vagina‚Äîwhich would otherwise provide an outflow for menstrual blood. It is most commonly caused by congenital abnormalities, including imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum or vaginal hypoplasia. Other causes are acquired, such as cervical stenosis, intrauterine adhesions, endometrial cancer, and cervical cancer. Additionally, hematometra may develop as a complication of uterine or cervical surgery such as endometrial ablation, where scar tissue in the endometrium can \\"wall off\\" sections of endometrial glands and stroma causing blood to accumulate in the uterine cavity. It can also develop after abortion, as well as after childbirth. It can also develop after female genital mutilation. Diagnosis Although hematometra can often be diagnosed based purely on the patient's history of amenorrhea and cyclic abdominal pain, as well as a palpable pelvic mass on examination, the diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound, which will show blood pooled in the uterus and an enlargement of the uterine cavity. A pyelogram or laparoscopy may assist in diagnosing any congenital disorder that is suspected to be the underlying cause of the hematometra. Management Hematometra is usually treated by surgical cervical dilation to drain the blood from the uterus. Other treatments target the underlying cause of the hematometra; for example, a hysteroscopy may be required to resect adhesions that have developed following a previous surgery. If the cause of the hematometra is unclear, a biopsy of endometrial tissue can be taken to test for the presence of a neoplasm (cancer). Antibiotics may be given as prophylaxis against the possibility of infection.

The park consists of six areas that show in part the history of the exploration of the Northwest Passage and the first successful passage by Roald Amundsen in the Gj√∏a. The park begins at the Nattilik Heritage Centre in Gjoa Haven, which is marked for expansion to include a proper museum, not yet built as of May 2020. The centre contains a replica of the Gj√∏a and the first salvaged items from the wrecks of Sir John Franklin's ships Erebus and Terror, along with examples of traditional Inuit tools and clothing and a history of the Netsilik Inuit. The second site is the former Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) site. This is where the HBC and the Canalaska Trading Company moved to in 1927. The buildings are still in use today by The North West Company. The third area is Gjoa Haven proper. Amundsen entered \\"the finest little harbor in the world\\" on 9 September 1903 and spent two winters there. Along with the observations, he also spent time learning survival skills from the local Inuit, who called the area Uqsuqtuuq (much blubber). The fourth is a cairn dedicated to Amundsen, north of the inlet, with a bronze memorial plaque describing his life, his ship and his journey. Amundsen erected here a few temporary buildings, whose only evidence remaining today are some earth mounds. The fifth area, on the island's northwestern coast, is a grave site that is believed to be one of places that members of Sir John Franklin's crew were buried. The final area is a shelter where Amundsen made observations on the North Magnetic Pole, about north of Gjoa Haven. There are traces of another shelter, that Amundsen used to house his instruments, a marble slab that he used to support his instruments, and a cairn dedicated to Amundsen's teacher George Von Neumayer.

The original group included founding members of Cross Culture, and appeared at the 2007 Gospel Music Week. The name Over Ashes is a reference to Isaiah 61:3. History Their d√©but album Begin Again was said to be \\"full of straight rock tracks, with a few worship ballads thrown in for good measure\\". A review in The Christian Pulse said that \\"for all the wonderful things one could say about the music they produce, it is their attitude that truly shines\\". Being the afterthought of Cross Culture (Selectric/Sony Red-2005), singer Justin David, and guitarist Dan s, along with newly added drummer Denver Shindle, began the studio works of \\"Begin Again\\", January 2007, with Production Duo Justin York (Tait, Steven Curtis Chapman) and Justin Glasco (Jeremy Camp, Kate Voegle, Carey Brothers, Mat Kearney). Dan s exited due to management difficulties, and the band was renamed as it was a new direction musically, and in lineup. Upon completion of the record, the band hit the road in early 2007, across the eastern seaboard and midwest, with touring bass player Lee Klopfenstein. In April 2007 right before GMA week in Nashville, TN, the band acquired Gardy Garcia from Houston, TX. The band released its record nationwide July 2007, debuting No. 3 on the CHR sales charts immediately behind Barlow Girl. It has since gone on to sell more than 28,000 records according to Neilson soundscan. Upon relocating from Columbus, OH to Nashville, TN in 2007, singer Justin David resigned from the group in October, although returning for an end of the year performance in Maryland. Through multiple personnel testing on guitar and vocals, JD Anderson joined as an additional guitarist briefly while Caleb Carpenter was brought in to replace Justin David. The band continued to tour periodically through 2008, and opted to go their separate ways after differences with management. Current projects from the band members include Coincidence Maybe (Denver Shindle), Tigerparty (Gardy Garcia), and Brightwork (formerly Facing the Lion) (Caleb Carpenter). Justin David was formerly the modern (Emerge) worship director at Jersey Church in Columbus, Ohio. Justin finished a collaborative recording project with multiple writers released in 2011 through Jersey Baptist Church crossing various styles including Gospel Choir, Pop Rock, and traditional choir.

According to the opinion of Sergei Sossinsky, although \\"Sergeyev-Tsensky does not belong to Russia's top classical authors, he might have [been] if he had not had the misfortune of living half his life under Communist rule.\\"A Riter (sic) Who Recreated Russia's Military Past. Sergei Sossinsky. Moscow News (Russia). YESTERYEAR; No. 43. November 1, 2000 Early life Sergei Sergeyev was born on , in the village of Preobrazhenskoye, Rasskazovsky District, Tambov Governorate. His father was a teacher and a retired veteran of the Crimean War of 1853‚Äì1856. At four, Sergeyev learned how to read and at five he already knew by heart many poems by Pushkin and Lermontov, as well as Krylov's fables, beginning to write his own poems at seven. At this time, his family had moved to Tambov where Sergei's father received a post in the government. It was reported that Sergeyev \\"was fascinated by Russian translations of the Iliad and the Odyssey and read them avidly [and] at school, rewrote a scene from Boris Godunov, adding rhymes to Pushkin's blank verse, and was taken to task by the literature teacher for trying to outdo the great poet\\" and that when he wrote a short story at home, \\"his father threw into the fire, saying that prose writing was even more difficult than poetry and he was not ready for it yet.\\" When his parents died, Sergeyev studied at a teacher-training college, graduating in 1895 and then worked as a teacher in different towns of Russia until 1904, when the Russo-Japanese War broke out and he was drafted into the army, where he spent two years. Career He published his first works in 1898, and his first book Thoughts and Dreams in 1901. The latter contained poems with strong civic undertones. Reportedly, \\"after his discharge from the army, Sergeyev-Tsensky bought a plot of land in Alushta, the Crimea, and built a house on it. He would live there for the rest of his life, only leaving this beautiful corner for short trips to St. Petersburg and Moscow, and other places. He sent his stories to periodicals for publication.\\". In 1907, he published the novel Babayev, where he described revolutionary events in a provincial town. It was reportedly \\"later discovered that the story of the officer hero of the novel was actually the author's own experience in the revolution.\\" Sergeyev had reportedly \\"virtually no friends among the popular writers of the day\\" and when, in 1906, Alexander Kuprin visited Alushta and sent a messenger to Sergeyev-Tsensky, Sergeyev \\"told the messenger that the letter was intended for his absent uncle.\\" Kuprin, however, was standing nearby and made sure he spoke with Sergeyev. \\"Such behavior was typical of Sergeyev-Tsensky\\" and when staying in a famous St. Petersburg hotel known as a place where most of Russia's great writers had stayed, \\"Sergeyev-Tsensky put a notice on his door saying 'I'm never at home.'\\" During World War I, the author was again drafted into the army, but was put into the reserve because of his age. Little was heard from the writer during World War I and the following Russian Civil War with lean times forcing Sergeyev to sell off his possessions for food. A story goes that a neighbor who helped him milk a newly acquired cow soon became his wife, Khristina ‚Äì a college graduate and a gifted pianist. The author turned to historical subjects in 1923, but with the communist rule, it became harder to write freely on any topic. With the rise of Maxim Gorky, however, who admired Sergeyev, things gradually improved. Reportedly, \\"in letter to Sergeyev-Tsensky, Gorky admitted that [although] they had differences in their attitudes to the human species [and] that Sergeyev- Tsensky did not have the respect for people that he, Gorky, felt, this did not prevent them from sharing many other basic feelings.\\" Even with Gorky's support, however, \\"Sergeyev-Tsensky had difficulty adapting to Soviet reality and was, in particular, forced to rewrite some of his earlier works.\\". The work of his life was Russia's Transfiguration which consisted of 12 novels, 3 stories and 2 studies. This work is reportedly comparable with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Red Wheel. Both are monumental works dealing with the period before, during and after the revolution. Sergeyev-Tsensky, however, is, reportedly, \\"a better stylist than Solzhenitsyn, who keeps inventing non- existent Russian words [and while] both works are biased, Solzhenitsyn's bias is monarchist and self-imposed, while Sergeyev-Tsensky no doubt had to tread carefully to save his life and struggle with himself to appear pro-Soviet.\\". \\"The late 1930s were a particularly dangerous time, and to weather it Sergeyev-Tsensky had the brilliant idea to write a work about the Crimean War. His father's library included an excellent selection of books about the siege of Sevastopol, and he set to work, producing three volumes in 1936‚Äì1938, the worst years of the Great Terror. For a while it was not clear if the work would be published. The imminent war and the need to revive Russia's military past finally tipped the scales in its favor. In 1939‚Äì1940 Sevastopol Labors was published, and in 1941 the writer received the Stalin Prize instead of being sent to the Gulag. It is also probable that the fact that he lived so far from the centers of power in the Soviet Union was another factor in saving him (Sergeyev-Tsensky had been given an apartment on Tverskaya Street in Moscow, but he still spent most of his time in the Crimea). His story was not unlike that of Maximilian Voloshin, poet, artist and critic who also lived in the Crimea all his life and survived the 1930s.\\". \\"With the outbreak of World War II it became easier for many decent writers, in particular Sergeyev- Tsensky, to wholeheartedly support the Soviet regime. He wrote patriotic articles encouraging the war effort.\\". \\"After the war Sergeyev-Tsensky's position as a leading Soviet Russian writer, as he was then known, was firmly established. Nevertheless, he continued to work feverishly, produced an incredibly large number of works, including several thousand poems and fables. His 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1955, and he also received the Lenin Prize.\\" He died in 1958 in Leningrad, aged 82. \\"It is important to note, however, that his best works were devoted to the military, whom he knew so well from his first-hand experience before the revolution. Readers who do not have a taste for military subjects find Sergeyev-Tsensky rather dull. Perhaps his best pages were devoted to the 1916 Brusilov Offensive in World War I and to General Brusilov himself. But his failing health and the difficulty of dealing with Soviet reality prevented him from completing Russia's Transfiguration. Despite the fact that Sergeyev-Tsensky may seem old-fashioned to some readers, his books continued to be published in large printings during perestroika, and he will always be read by the general reader, to say nothing of intellectuals.\\".

Westen, a spy and former Special Forces Operative of the Green Berets and Army Rangers, is widely known as a top CIA operative. As a result, in many circles he is greatly feared. He abruptly became the subject of a burn notice while on an assignment. Forced to return to his hometown of Miami, Florida, he finds himself cut off from the United States Intelligence Community. While searching for answers about his burn notice, Michael becomes an unlicensed freelance private investigator/troubleshooter to help those who have unique problems. Role in Burn Notice Michael Alan Westen was born on January 7, 1967,episode \\"Past and Future Tense\\" and raised in Miami, Florida, the first of two sons to Frank and Madeline Westen. His father was a violent man, who would physically and emotionally abuse his two sons as an obedience measure, and his mother did little to prevent it. His father would also take advantage of him, for example, he forced Michael to fake a seizure inside a Mr. Goodwrench store so his father could steal spark plugs. The last words his father said to him were \\"I'll see you in Hell, boy.\\" Eight years prior to the beginning of the series, his father died. After persistent persuasion by his mother, Michael finally visited his father's grave. Michael's younger brother, Nate, is a compulsive gambler who has a history of stealing from Michael to fund his addiction. However, after helping Michael and almost dying, he has turned his life around, which Michael seems to have difficulty believing. After a brief quarrel with his brother, Michael wins his father's black 1973 Dodge Charger by coin toss.Season 5, Episode 4: No Good Deed In the fifth season, it is revealed that later in his life, Michael's father met Anson Fullerton and admitted his sorrow that he never got the chance to apologize to his son. Anson used Frank Westen to gain information on Michael, and when Frank became suspicious, Anson arranged for his death. Michael enlisted in the U.S. Army when he was 17 years old, and his mother forged his father's signature so he could enlist. Little is mentioned about his time in the Army but it is known he was a Ranger and former Special Forces soldier. It was implied in an episode that he served in San Pedro Laguna before he was recruited to work as a spy. He served for 15 years, working in Europe and the OPEC nations as a covert operative who did freelance work for the CIA. While on a mission in Nigeria, he received a burn notice from CIA superiors. After managing to embark on an airplane in Nigeria, Michael is deserted in Miami, with Fiona Glenanne, his ex-girlfriend. Per the conditions of Michael's burn notice, his assets are frozen, his line of credit is destroyed, and he has no career history with which to seek employment. He is free to travel within Miami, but any attempts to relocate outside of the city will result in immediate arrest. Michael now has to find work that suits his unusual skillset and knowledge. He counts on longtime friends like Sam Axe, who informed on him to the FBI until midway through the first season, and Fiona to help him perform such tasks, while fighting with his mother Madeline Westen and trying to find out who burned him and why. Michael lives in a decrepit loft situated over a nightclub, with a bed, workbench, some barbells, a punching bag, no air conditioning, an oven, a few chairs, a mid-1990s era computer, and a refrigerator filled with yogurt and alcohol. He obtained the loft in the pilot episode, when he assisted his Russian landlord and club owner by ridding a drug dealer (Raymond, nicknamed \\"Sugar\\") who also lived on the premises. He also spends time at hotels in Miami, as well as his mother's house. Upon returning to Miami, Michael was watched by the FBI. It was revealed that he was burned in order to be recruited by a mysterious organization and is contacted by a woman named Carla (Tricia Helfer). After Carla was killed by Fiona, Michael received an offer to replace her by a man referred to as the organization's \\"Management.\\" He refused to take the job and lost the security detail and personal restrictions he had been under to protect him from the countless enemies he made as a CIA operative, choosing to be free from the organization's hold. It is later discovered that the organization was also protecting him from the rest of the world who were hunting the name Michael Westen. Michael continued to work toward removing his burn notice and being reinstated in the CIA. Michael then approached CIA agent Diego Garza, who became his point of contact for the CIA. Michael was also approached himself and later threatened by Tom Strickler, an \\"agent to the spies\\" with powerful connections. Tom had tried to remove Fiona from Michael's life, and Michael subsequently killed him. With Tom dead, the incident sparked a chain of events that led Diego to be murdered by Mason Gilroy, a former MI6 spy and freelance black ops psychopath. Michael ended up working with Gilroy in order to find out his plan. Michael eventually found out that Gilroy was working on securing the release of a high risk fugitive named Simon Escher. Gilroy succeeded in freeing him but is later killed by Simon. In another revelation, Simon was the one responsible for the actions that got blamed on Michael when he was burned. Simon's profile was transferred to Michael. Simon forced Michael to bring Management to Miami but ends up being recaptured again when Michael overtook him. After initially being taken away by the authorities, Michael is taken into Management's custody by use of their high level government contacts. A high-level member of Management named Vaughn, convinces Michael about a group of people in the world who are plotting assassinations, political coups, funding terrorist organizations, genocide and are using the terrible effects of such actions to greatly profit. Michael agrees to help Management in order to stop the organization that broke Simon out of prison. During the process of investigating, Michael accidentally burns a spy named Jesse Porter. Despite the objection from Fiona and his own mother, Michael kept secret to Jesse about his role in destroying his life. Later, Jesse discovered Michael's deception and vowed revenge. Just before Jessie found out, Michael found a close link to the organization behind Simon and a mysterious book code contained within an out of print Family Bible, a power-broker and billionaire CEO of Drake Technologies, named John Barrett. Michael offered to trade him the stolen bible in exchange for shedding some light on who he's up against and what the Bible (as a book code) decrypts - the true identities of the organization that burned Michael. Management ‚Äì the people who burned him ‚Äì are hidden within the United States government, private-military corporations and various other powerful organizations. Barrett planned on recruiting Michael to help him eliminate them. During the exchange of the case, Michael was shot by Jesse during a confrontation of Vaughn's and John Barrett's team. Michael, bleeding, was taken by John Barrett. Michael then caused the car he was in to crash, leaving John Barrett dead. Michael survives the accident and manages to crawl out of the wreckage. With Michael bleeding out and unconscious, someone steals the case. Michael eventually recovered from his injuries. With the help of Fiona, Sam, and Jesse, Michael was able to recover the information on Management. Michael and Jessie turned over the flash drive to Marv - in exchange for Michael testifying to everything he knows about the organization, Jesse's old CIA handler. Seconds after the handoff Marv is killed by men posing as Homeland Security agents and the flash drive is stolen by Tyler Brennen, an enemy Michael makes during the second season, who dislikes him even more after their next encounter in season three, and is one of the most intelligent villains he has encountered. Brennen, threatening to expose Michael's betrayal to Vaughn, blackmailed Michael into killing the people who on the list who burned him. Brennen is murdered by Larry Sizemore who was recruited by Brennan to be Michael's partner for the killings. Michael was able to defeat Larry, but Vaughn found out of Michael's betrayal. Vaughn and his team goes after Michael and those around him but is arrested. Michael was then taken by two mysterious men to Washington, DC and was met by an unknown acquaintance. The unknown acquaintance turns out to be Raines, Michael's former recruiter, who helps Michael hunt down every member of Management in an attempt to get Michael un-burned. After Michael has successfully eliminated every member, another spy he had been working with, his handler, Max, is murdered and Michael is framed for the murder. Agent Pearce, who's been sent by the CIA to investigate Max's murder and serve as Michael's new agency contact. Michael must do what he can to aid the CIA's investigation while keeping the evidence from leading to his own doorstep. It leads back to him and Pearce takes him in. After he finds the killer is a Russian named Tavian Korzha the CIA lets Michael go to talk to him where he throws himself off a 5-story, unfinished, parking structure. Larry comes back and kidnaps Anson, holding his wife hostage, forcing Michael to help him breaking into the British consulate, frame several British government personnel, and gain two million dollars.. Larry reveals that he plans on killing Michael after Fi and Sam find Anson's wife had been blown up. Fiona plants a small explosive to kill Larry. The building suddenly explodes from the bottom, killing 2 security guards inside. It turns out that Anson planted the bomb and framed Fi and he is the founder of Management and threatened to have the CIA and MI6 after Fi if Michael does not do his dirty work. Eventually, Fiona grows tired of Michael working for Anson and turns herself into the FBI when Anson tries to get Michael to burn a CIA Operations team for him. Michael arrives at the Federal Building as Fiona is turning herself in. Michael becomes extremely angry and chases Anson to a chemical plant in the Florida Keys. Anson outwits Michael by rigging the building explode and attaching the detonator on a dead man switch. Michael, again vows to go after Anson and bring him in dead or alive, despite the support of Agent Pierce and the CIA. By working with Rebecca, Anson's partner, who was also blackmailed by Anson, he tracks Anson down to Atlantic City and goes after him to take him with Jessie, Pearce and Nate. Michael's life takes a further turn for the worse when Tyler Grey kills his younger brother, Nate, as well as Anson. As such, Michael, Madeline, Sam, Fiona, and Jesse are all hell-bent on exacting revenge for Nate's murder. Eventually, Michael, with his former mentor Tom Card helping him, tracks Nate's killer, Tyler Grey, to Panama. After Michael successfully captures him, Grey reveals Card was the one who pulled the strings behind Anson's death, since Card had been working with Anson and Card decided to kill Anson to keep him from talking. The mission to Panama was supposed to be a suicide mission for Michael and his friends. After barely escaping Card's air strike, Michael and the others attempt to get back to Miami, all the while learning that Grey had been lied to by Card about what he was told about Michael. After realizing Michael wasn't the person he was told, Grey agrees to help Michael take down Card. Returning to Miami, Grey assists Michael in gathering intel on Card, but when Card discovers Grey's betrayal, Card kills Grey, makes it look like a struggle and tries to convince Michael that they can do \\"great things\\" and has always been proud of him. However, Michael, unable to forgive Card for what he did and knowing what he's capable of, shoots Card through the head, killing him in cold blood. With the help of his friends, they barely escape as Olivia Riley, a ruthless counterintelligence agent for the CIA who \\"wrote the book on counterintelligence\\" goes after them and swears she will not stop until they are all dead. Knowing they can't stay in the country anymore, Michael and the others (including Madeline) all attempt to leave the country with the help of Calvin Schmidt, a smuggler, but Riley tracks them down. When Riley resorts to using drug cartels to take down Michael after several failed attempts, Michael asks Bly to assist him in proving Riley's betrayal, only for Bly to die in the process, along with the evidence. Not wanting Bly to die for nothing, Michael plays a dangerous game of chicken with Riley and the Coast Guard, after which Riley backs down and surrenders her complicity to the CIA deputy chief. After several months, Michael's friends are released, but Michael had to make a deal to do so; going on a deep cover job to take down the leader of a terrorist organization, prompting Fi to be disgusted, stating Michael did what he wanted to and backs away, heart-broken, leaving Michael distraught. During the 100th episode of the series, it is shown how Michael first met Fiona as spies in Ireland. With the final season working its way through the first half of the expected episodes, Michael Westen is struggling to ensure his friends and family remain free of the agency's grasp on what the show has hinted is his final mission to clear his name. Slowly but surely Michael begins to lose himself and a firm grip on his morals, succumbing to the mission. He proves this by sleeping with Sonya (Alona Tal) and killing an old friend of his. When Michael discovers that the CIA put Simon Escher in charge of the capture team, he begins to question their beliefs. Michael kills Simon just as the capture team's backup arrives, and decides to protect James. He admits his deception to James, who is angry, but has a plan to continue his organization by putting Michael and Sonya in charge, and allowing Michael to \\"capture\\" him. Michael's friends refuse to believe he's given up on the CIA, and form a plan to abduct him, but he fights against Sam and warns them to stay out of his way. Fearing he's lost his morals, Fiona tracks Michael to the site for James' \\"capture\\". Sonya a tells Michael that if Fi doesn't leave, Sonya will have her killed. Michael hesitates, but shoots Sonya before she can kill Fiona. James witnesses this from a helicopter orders his men to kill Michael and Fiona. Sam and Jesse help Michael and Fiona escape, and they go on the offensive, tracking down a data center used by James's organization and stealing data that they could then use to unravel the entire organization. James arrives to confront them, threatening to have Madeline killed; however, Madeline sacrifices her life to kill James's hit squad and protect Jesse and Charlie. In the shootout, James is killed, but charges in the building detonate and Michael and Fiona were considered dead in the explosion. Unknown to the CIA, Michael and Fiona survived. Officially dead, they fled the United States with Charlie and settled down to raise him in peace and obscurity in Ireland. Concept and creation Burn Notice creator Matt Nix said in a late 2010 interview Characterization LA Weekly described Michael as \\"Jim Rockford and MacGyver filtered through Carl Hiaasen.\\"\\"Burn Notice: Tune In, Zone Out\\" by Robert Abele, LA Weekly July 3, 2007 Bruce Campbell comments on Michael Westen: \\"Well, the idea is being a CIA agent, Michael Westen can take his skills, you know, MacGyver-ish type skills and make a shotgun out of a twig.\\" Michael's romantic relationships are a significant source of subplots in Burn Notice. It is revealed in the episode \\"Sins of Omission\\" that ten years previous, Michael was engaged to a professional thief named Samantha, but they never married and eventually separated. Around that time, Michael met Fiona Glenanne, an IRA bomb maker and weapons expert, while undercover in Ireland. Their relationship also ended when Michael was extracted, though Fiona became aware of Michael's real name and position as a US intelligence operative. During the course of the series, Fiona helps Michael with his various cases and his investigations in Miami, and they still have a close, if strained, relationship. While Fiona plays coy during most of Season 1, during Season 2 it is apparent that they are moving toward a reconciliation. When Fiona investigates a bomb maker's home and a fire erupts that consumes the entire building, Michael believes that she had been killed in the fire, and discovers her alive and well at his apartment, albeit without a cellphone that was destroyed. Realizing that Michael was on the verge of a breakdown over her possible death, the two make love. In the end after everyone believed they were dead Michael and Fiona are seen in what seems to be a beautiful cottage in Ireland. The two are raising Charlie as their son. Michael worries about what he will tell Charlie when he is older and Fiona tells him to tell Charlie the truth. He asks \\"where would I start\\" and she tells him to start from the beginning and she tells him to start with \\"My name is Michael Westen I used to be a spy\\" in front of the fire Michael kisses Fiona. Michael's family is also included in the show. In the pilot episode, Michael once remarked that his mother \\"would have been a great intelligence analyst. She could find you if you were buried in the middle of the Gobi Desert and ask you why you didn't come home for Thanksgiving dinner.\\" She is also a provider for some of Michael's cases by suggesting friends who are in trouble. His mother in particular is at times demanding and a valuable asset, and has recently been used to conduct initial surveillance. She's also revealed to have a deep understanding of psychology and interrogation, after she manages to coerce information out of a smuggler within minutes of Fiona and Sam having given up. Despite being left in the dark for much of the series, she is now much more involved and aware of Michael's operations, though she seems to accept this as a matter of course. While Michael begins working harder towards being recalled to active service and working for a mercenary, Fiona grows more and more distant. Michael strikes Fiona as part of maintaining a cover identity. Fiona claims that doing this work is changing Michael, and that she can't stay and watch it happen, and plans to move back to Ireland. These plans are curtailed when both Fiona's brother and an exiled Irish mercenary arrive. The exiled Irish mercenary kidnaps Fiona, and Michael's original Irish cover is blown. When Michael and Sam attempt a rescue, Fiona is shot in the arm when she jumps off the pier to escape the gunfire. Michael panics when he sees Fiona float to the surface unconscious and quickly pulls her out and is relieved when she comes to. Fiona's brother tells Michael that Fiona, now associated with a foreign intelligence operative, will almost certainly be killed if she returns to Ireland, though he tells Michael that he is proud to know his sister chose well. This incident strengthens their bond again, and soon thereafter they have sex at a hotel. Michael and Fiona experiences tensions afterwards while he continues to focus on his burn notice with the CIA. As a covert operative, Michael is incredibly resourceful and holds an extensive knowledge of topics including bushcraft, Posttraumatic stress disorder, escapology, chemistry, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, medicine, surgery, and criminal psychology, despite a remark by a client and former friend that he \\"vanished before high school graduation\\". During the second season finale in a car chase, Michael is able to fashion a quick explosive out of chemicals found in his glove compartment. As a covert operative, Michael is also a keen bluffer, once being able to bluff an arms dealer to believe that he transferred $200 000 into his account (a ruse that would have been found out by a bank manager in Zurich in a few minutes) or making a bank robber believe that he was a doctor. Known by his professional reputation, Michael is regarded with fear by people associated with the intelligence community. A Spetsnaz wet work operative remarked that \\"everyone in Russian Special Forces has heard of the name Michael Westen. He is a myth like the bogeyman.\\" He was also personally offered a job by the Head of the Libyan Secret Police, who stated that their intelligence services were not known for being gentle. In one episode, Larry once quipped, \\"Where is the old Michael Westen I knew? The one who would have left behind a bloodbath with a smile on his face?\\" Despite being professionally regarded as a cold killer, Michael is hesitant to kill anyone unless he had to, once needing Victor to tell him that he had to do it in order to sell the story to Management. That is not to say that Michael would not kill, where during the third season finale he might have killed Simon and only stopped when Management asked him not to, and murders Strickler, a spy broker, in his home earlier in the season after learning he passed information about Fiona's whereabouts to her enemies. As a character, Michael is seen to have several 'trademark' characteristics. He wears expensive suits (during one episode he reveals the label showing the suit to be Armani, and always wears the same pair of Oliver Peoples sunglasses, which he at one points states to have retrieved from an Algerian special ops soldier that he tangled with who \\"didn't need them anymore.\\" At end of Season 2, Michael takes off his sunglasses for his meeting with Management before jumping out of the latter's helicopter, although he obtains another pair. His favorite snack food is yogurt, particularly blueberry, and he keeps a ready supply in his refrigerator. Appearances Michael Westen appears in tie-in novels written by Tod Goldberg. The official website for the show has a collection of short videos in which Michael dispenses advice for certain problems people have, such as how to evade an ex who's been following them or how to get a table at a restaurant that's booked solid. Michael even explains how to break out of a prison in Turkmenistan, although he gives the camera a look before starting. In general, the \\"advice\\" is theoretically possible but impractical for most people. For instance, the explanation on how to break out of a prison in Turkmenistan ends with Michael telling the person to swim across the Caspian Sea. Westen is also briefly mentioned in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Volume III: 2009 as a disgruntled former CIA agent providing intelligence to MI6.

To this day, Amtrak trains travel from Central Florida to South Florida on the route built by Warfield. Personal life Warfield was born in Baltimore County, Maryland, the son of Henry Mactier Warfield and Anna W. Emory Warfield, and was named for a friend of his father's, Sol B. Davies. Warfield's father was a prominent grain merchant and director of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. He was a paternal uncle of Wallis Warfield Simpson, (later the Duchess of Windsor), for whom King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, (later the Duke of Windsor) abdicated his throne in 1937. Warfield never married. Corporate positions *President of the Seaboard Air Line Railway, *President of the Continental Trust Company of Baltimore, *President of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company, (\\"Old Bay Line\\"), *Director of the Maryland Casualty Company, *Director of the New York Life Insurance Company, SS President Warfield A few months after Warfield's death, the SS President Warfield was built in 1928 by Pusey and Jones Corporation, in Wilmington, Delaware, for the century-old Baltimore Steam Packet Company, also known as the \\"Old Bay Line,\\" operating steamships on Chesapeake Bay between Baltimore and Norfolk, Virginia, their Chesapeake Bay. The Old Bay Line was controlled by the Seaboard Air Line Railway; Warfield was president of both companies in the 1920s. During World War II, the President Warfield was acquired by the U. S. government and transferred to Great Britain in 1942 under the Lend-Lease program to serve as a troop transport. In 1944, the ship was put under U. S. Navy control, and was laid up as surplus in 1945 after the war ended. Purchased secretly in 1946 by the Jewish nationalist organization Haganah and renamed Exodus 1947, the ship was briefly in the world spotlight as one of several vessels illegally attempting to carry Jewish refugees to British-controlled Palestine. This unsuccessful incident was later the subject of the 1958 novel Exodus by Baltimorean Leon Uris, (1924-2003) and the motion picture based upon it, released in 1960. The ship remained in Haifa harbor until it burned to the waterline in 1952, and was later scrapped. References External links *\\"S.

Various head of states, including the king, head of government, ministers etc. have visited Israel and continued his foreign policy. Except for a brief 9 months period of Maoist government in Nepal, all other Nepalese governments in general have had a strongly pro- Israel foreign policy. However, Nepal is not one of the nations that refrained from allowing Palestine an observer status at the UN unlike nations such as the United States, Australia, Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Panama, the Czech Republic, and Nauru.  Political relations King Mahendra with Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, 1963 King Mahendra of Nepal (second from left) in a 1958 visit to Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science. Diplomatic relations between Nepal and Israel were established on 1 June 1960.Ministry of Foreign Affairs Nepal Since the establishment of ties, Nepal has supported Israel internationally. Israel opened its embassy in Kathmandu in March 1961. The Nepalese Ambassador to Egypt was at first accredited to Israel. Nepal also opened the Nepalese honorary consulate general in Israel in 1993 and embassy in 2007. The current Nepalese Ambassador to Israel is Baija Nath Thapalia, who presented his credentials to President Peres on March 19, 2008. Nepal is the first and until recently only country in South Asia to recognize the existence of Israel. Nepal has maintained diplomatic relations and continues to support the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries. Nepal voted in favour of Security Council Resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which upheld the right of all the states in the region to live in peace. Nepal has also welcomed every initiative from whatever quarter that seeks to resolve the Middle East problems like the Camp David Accords signed between Egypt and Israel in 1978 and the renewed peace process sponsored time to time by countries like the USA. In 1975, the United Nations General Assembly passed an Arab sponsored resolution (3379) that equated Zionism and racism and racial discrimination. Nepal expressed its reservation throughout the discussions on the issue and did not support the resolution. In the context of renewed peace in West Asia, the United States took the initiatives to introduce a draft resolution to repeal the resolution 3379 of 1975 in the 46th Session of the UNGA. A large majority adopted the draft resolution. Nepal voted in favour of the resolution. Israel, USA and the Western Countries appreciated Nepal's support for the resolution. Nepal welcomed the historic accord signed between Israel and Palestine Liberation Organization on 13 September 1993 in Washington, DC, on autonomy for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank Town of Jericho and also the agreement signed on 10 September 1993 on mutual recognition to each other. Former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala sent letters of appreciation to Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel and Yasser Arafat, President and PLO Chairman, for this courageous decision taken by them and expressed hope that this would be instrumental in establishing peace, order and stability in West Asia. Nepal welcomed the ceasefire announced after a summit held between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Leader Mahmud Abbas in Egypt on February 8, 2005 to end four years of bloodshed. Nepal opened its embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel on 13 August 2007. Economic Cooperation Israel and Nepal have progressing economic ties. Israel has been helping Nepal in the fields of technical specialities and Nepal has been supplying manpower to Israel. The chamber of commerce of both nations have trade links as well. The Israel-Nepal Chamber of Commerce is part of the Israel-Asia Chamber of Commerce, and is headed by Anat Bernstein-Reich and Raviv Byron. The Nepal-Israel Chamber of Commerce based in Kathmandu was established in 2020 and a memorandum of understanding to enhance collaboration was signed between the two sister chambers. =Training= Israel has extended cooperation to Nepal in establishment of the National Construction Company of Nepal and training facilities for the Royal Nepalese Army personnel in parachuting. Israel has been providing Nepal with short-term scholarships in various subjects, particularly in the areas of agriculture, education, rural development, water resources, tourism, etc. Similarly, the Israeli experts in Nepal on farm management, artificial insemination, irrigation, childhood education, workers, and cooperative biotechnology and farm machinery conducted seven on-the-spot courses. =Manpower= Nepal has been supplying Israel with manpower. A number of Nepalese citizens work in Israel and there is demand for more manpower from Nepal. It is estimated that about 12,000 Nepalese foreign workers are residing in Israel, most of whom are women working as caregivers. Israel has clarified it would not allow Nepali workers in its territory due to the ill-practices followed of Nepali manpower agents rendering the efforts from Nepali side to reopen Israel as a labor destination futile. Israel had stopped Nepali workers in April 2009, saying Nepali manpower agents had charged exorbitant fees with the workers, created nexus with Israel-based Nepali brokers and sent low-skilled workers. Recently, Israel has clarified to the Nepali mission in Israel, it would not reopen the process of welcoming Nepali workers until the activities of manpower agents are ‚Äòimproved‚Äô, according to sources at labor ministry. =Trade= A Protocol of Cooperation was signed between the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries and Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce in Tel Aviv on 25 June 1993 during the official visit of then Prime Minister Mr. Girija Prasad Koirala to Israel. The trade between Nepal and Israel has remained in favour of Israel. Nepal exported items amounted to Rs 3,175,682 and imported amounted Rs 483,695,044, having trade deficit of Rs 480,519,362 in fiscal year 2003/04 according to the Trade Promotion Center.On May 21st 2020, an MOU for trade promotion was signed between the Nepal-Israel Chamber of Commerce, based in Nepal and the Israel-Asia Chamber of Commerce which is the umbrella organization for the Israel-India and Nepal Chamber of Commerce. =Air service= The Government of Nepal and the Israeli Government signed a bilateral Air Services Agreement (ASA) on November 18, 2002. = Disaster Relief= After the 2015 Nepal earthquake, Israel was one of the first to send aid to Nepal. Israel sent a delegation of 264 people for Search & Rescue missions, and over 95 tons of equipment, including a field hospital. Bilateral Visits Late Prime Minister Mr. BP Koirala paid an official visit to Israel in 1960, which was very important in the context that many countries had not recognized and many had outlawed Israel at that time. After coming to power through a military coup which overthrew the democratic government of BP Koirala, the autocratic monarch of Nepal, Mahendra paid a State Visit to Israel in September 1963, to rally support for his regime. He maintained Koirala's special relationship with Israel.Abadi, Jacob. Israel's Quest for Recognition and Acceptance in Asia: Garrison State Diplomacy, 2004. Page 318. This was returned by Late Israeli President Zalman Shazar's Official Visit to Nepal later. In 1968, Birendra, then Crown Prince, paid a two-week study visit to Israel. Then Foreign Minister of Israel late Moshe Dayan visited Nepal in April 1979. After the restoration of democracy in 1990, the then Speaker of the House of Representatives, Daman Nath Dhungana, paid an official visit to Israel in January 1992 at the invitation of the Speaker of the Knesset. On 23‚Äì25 June 1993, the then Prime Minister of Nepal, Girija Prasad Koirala paid an Official Visit to Israel. Minister of Agriculture and Local Development Ram Chandra Paudel paid an Official Visit to Israel on 17‚Äì21 November 1993.

Global palladium sales were 8.84 million ounces in 2017 of which 86% was used in the manufacturing of automotive catalytic converters, followed by industrial, jewelry, and investment usages. Palladium is a chemical element first discovered in 1803, and since the 1980s, its major commercial application has been in the automotive industry. More than 75% of global platinum and 40% of palladium are mined in South Africa. Russia's mining company, Norilsk Nickel, produces another 44% of palladium, with US and Canada-based mines producing most of the rest. The price for palladium reached an all time high of $1,603.00 per ounce on September 16th 2019 driven mainly on speculation of the catalytic converter demand from the automobile industry. Palladium is traded in the spot market with the code \\"XPD\\". When settled in USD, the code is \\"XPDUSD\\".

The Siddis of Karnataka' () (also spelled Siddhis) are an ethnic group inhabiting India. Members are descended from Bantu peoples from Southeast Africa that were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by Portuguese merchants. There is a 50,000 strong Siddi population across India, of which more than a third live in Karnataka. In Karnataka, they are concentrated around Yellapur, Haliyal, Ankola, Joida, Mundgod and Sirsi taluks of Uttara Kannada and in Khanapur of Belgaum and Kalghatgi of Dharwad district. Many members of the Siddi community have migrated to Pakistan after independence and have settled in Karachi and Sindh. Recently, they have come into the limelight by Sneha Khanwalkar's soundtrack 'Yere' for MTV Sound Trippin. Etymology There are various hypotheses on the origin of the name Siddi. One theory is that the word was a term of respect in North Africa, similar to the word sahib in modern India and Pakistan. A second theory is that the term Siddi is derived from the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to India. These captains were known as Sayyid. The term seems to have found currency following a description in a letter written by one William aboard the S.S. Nepal, a ship that sailed from England to South India and Ceylon. In the letter he describes the crew of the ship as \\"composed of seven English quarter masters and forty three lascar seamen, six English engineers, thirty-five men (Muslim) and fifteen Sidimen or negroes for coal shifters.\\" Similarly, another term for Siddis, habshi (from Al-Habsh, the Arabic term for Abyssinia), is held to be derived from the common name for the captains of the Ethiopian/Abyssinian ships that also first delivered Siddi slaves to the subcontinent.Vijay Prashad, Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting: Afro-Asian Connections and the Myth of Cultural Purity, (Beacon Press: 2002), p.8 The term eventually came to be applied to other Africans and not only to emancipated Siddis. In time, it came to be used to refer to their descendants as well. It is sometimes pronounced \\"Hafsi\\" and is considered an insult. History The majority of the Siddhis in Karnataka are descended from Bantu peoples from Southeast Africa that were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by the Portuguese between the 16th and 19th centuries. During the Goan Inquisition, some of these slaves were freed and some escaped into the forests of the neighbouring Karnataka state. As the bulk of the Inquisition's records are now destroyed, a thorough reconstruction of the Siddhis' history in India and in Karnataka is very difficult. However, the few records that exist present a picture of oppression and ill treatment that the slaves were subjected to. A few of them, however, are also said to have escaped slavery. While most of them were victims of slave trade, some of them also were imported by the Nawabs in the 15th-16th centuries as military mercenaries. Others were sailors on the trade routes to the east. In 2013, the New York Public Library held an artistic exhibition entitled Africans In India: From Slaves to Generals and Rulers, which retraced the lives and accomplishments of prominent Siddis from the past. Lasting until July, it included 100 reproductions of paintings and modern photographs. Religion Majority of the Siddis in Karnataka follows Hinduism. There is a significant number following Islam and Christianity.http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/SCST- Series/ST14/ST-29-00-014-DDW-2011.XLS The Haliyal taluk has populations of Muslims and Christians while the Hindu populations are concentrated in the ghat areas of Yellapur and Ankola.Sadiq Ali, Shanti. 1996. The African dispersal in the Deccan: from medieval to modern times. New Delhi: Orient Longman. Although Siddhis opt for different religions they intermarry across religions without any reservations. ;Hiriyaru worship The one factor which binds the Siddhis, irrespective of their religion is the Hiriyaru or ancestor worship. The dead are believed to be nearby, in the form of spirits. They are regarded as witnesses to be consulted by a family in all its concerns. On occasions like births, marriages and deaths, the ancestors are invoked. The home is organised around Hiriyaru, the spirits of departed parents. It signifies a remembrance of the parents, thanking them for their care over several years and also entreating them to keep a vigil over the family in future. It is obligatory for all relatives to attend the function, thus renewing kinship relations. Hiriyaru worship may be performed twice a year by the 'Kartha'(head) of the family. It normally is held during the Navarathri festival in the first week of November. If this is not possible for some reason, it may also be performed in April‚ÄìMay during the other major festival - Holi. These obviously are not meant to coincide with the dates of the parents' deaths as the Siddis only observe the first death anniversary. Hindu Siddhis usually have elaborate functions to mark the event, but not so the Christian and Muslim Siddhis. Language Siddis mainly speak Konkani, the native language of Goa which belongs to the Indo-Aryan family. Some also speak other languages, such as Kannada and Marathi. Occupation Almost all Siddis today subsist as agricultural and casual labourers, contractual or in some cases bonded, some also work as domestic help. The earliest Siddhi settlers who fled Goa and entered the Karnataka forests of North Canara, made the forests their home and started cultivation. In some of the villages in these areas, they form the earliest settlers. Siddi Farmer in the fields of Yellapur District, Karnataka, India. Art The Siddis of Karnataka are known in recent years for their unique style of quilting called kawandi. Siddis go through a complicated process of quilting that makes their style distinct from surrounding groups. The process involves taking recycled fabric scraps and arranging them in stylistic geometric patterns, sometimes embedded with religious symbols. Quilts are usually made for family members by older women who can no longer work in the fields. The quilts are put to use as mattresses, crib covers, or covers for cold monsoon nights. The non-profit organization Siddis Women Quilting Cooperative (SWQC) was created in 2004 in an effort to provide a source of income to the community and quilt makers. In 2011 an exhibition titled ‚ÄúSoulful Stitching: Patchwork Quilts by Africans(Siddis) in India‚Äù was shown in the Museum of the African Diaspora, helping these quilt makers and the community to gain recognition. Assimilation A feature common to the Siddis of Karnataka, as also of those of Maharashtra and Goa, is that they exhibit a remarkable level of assimilation with local culture. This, in the absence of any form of force. Even the uniquely Siddi custom of Hiriyaru has adopted symbols from the local Hindu religion. Except for the racial characteristics of the tribe, there is little else that can set them apart from other native populations. Almost all the siddis in present-day India are mixed indo-African There are very few pure siddi populations in Karnataka today, most of the pure Siddi population living in Gujarat. Many of them have lost their original African names and culture however they have retained some forms of African traditions in the form of dance and music. Historical references There are references to Siddhi palace guards in Kodagu during the reign of Dodda Veerarajendra (1763‚Äì1809) in the Kannada book Kodagina Itihasa. An account by Rev. G. Richter in 1870 also makes a note of \\"African bodyguards\\" in the service of the same king.\\"The Raja had surrounded his house with African bodyguards\\" A Siddhi called Gajaveera is noted to have joined hands with Sangolli Rayanna in his revolt against the British in 1829‚Äì30 near Kittur. In the revolt of 1844 at Sawantwadi in the Ratnagiri district of neighbouring Maharashtra state, records show that two Siddhi brothers, Bastian and Benove, from Punsolli near Dandeli had been enlisted by Phen Sawant, a noble of the Sawantwadi court. The first notable act of this group seems to have been their looting of a British outpost during the Supa Uprising when they confiscated government funds, took many chaukidars (watchmen) captive and burnt several outposts. The leaders of the 'bundh' are said to have taken shelter in the Darshanigudda ranges and at times escaped into neighbouring Goa territory. There are also references to a formidable fight at Dandeli and one at a Somalinga temple. These activities continued for several months and the British eventually sentenced some of them. The Portuguese also deported more than 100 of these insurgents along with the Sawant brothers and their families to Timor in the East Indies. Gunaba Shenvi, Siddi Bastian, his brother Anna Saheb and the three Phadnis brothers were still at large and in July 1859, the British offered rewards of Rs. 1000 each for their arrest. Chintoba Phadnis and Siddi Bastian were eventually killed in an encounter at Jagabet. Demographics In India, Karnataka has the largest concentration of Siddis. According to latest estimates there are around 3,700 Siddi families in the state with a total population of 18,000. Other Siddhi populations in the sub-continent include around 10,000 in Gujarat and 12,000 in Hyderabad. A few hundreds are also in Lucknow, Delhi and Calcutta. Fewer than 1,000 \\"Ceylon Kapris\\" live in Sri Lanka. Genetics Recent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the ethnogenesis of the Siddi. Genetic genealogy, although a novel tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern Siddi. =Y DNA= A Y-chromosome study by Shah et al. (2011) tested Siddi individuals in India for paternal lineages. The authors observed the E1b1a1 haplogroup (now called Haplogroup E-M2), which is frequent among Bantu peoples, in about 42% and 34% of Siddis from Karnataka and Gujarat, respectively. Around 14% of Siddis from Karnataka and 35% of Siddis from Gujarat also belonged to the Sub-Saharan B-M60. The remaining Siddis had Indian or Near Eastern-associated clades, including haplogroups P, H, R1a-M17, J2 and L-M20. Thangaraj (2009) observed similar, mainly Bantu-linked paternal affinities amongst the Siddi. =mtDNA= According to an mtDNA study by Shah et al. (2011), the maternal ancestry of the Siddi consists of a mixture of Sub-Saharan and Indian haplogroups, reflecting substantial female gene flow from neighboring Indian populations. About 53% of the Siddis from Gujarat and 24% of the Siddis from Karnataka belonged to various Sub-Saharan macro-haplogroup L sub-clades. The latter mainly consisted of L0 and L2a sublineages associated with Bantu women. The remainder possessed Indian-specific subclades of the Eurasian haplogroups M and N, which points to recent admixture with autochthonous Indian groups. =Autosomal DNA= Narang et al. (2011) examined the autosomal DNA of Siddis in India. According to the researchers, about 58% of the Siddis' ancestry is derived from Bantu peoples. The remainder is associated with local Indo- European-speaking North and Northwest Indian populations, due to recent admixture events. Similarly, Shah et al. (2011) observed that Siddis in Gujarat derive 66.90%-70.50% of their ancestry from Bantu forebears, while the Siddis in Karnataka possess 64.80%-74.40% such Southeast African ancestry. The remaining autosomal DNA components in the studied Siddi were mainly associated with local South Asian populations. According to the authors, gene flow between the Siddis' Bantu ancestors and local Indian populations was also largely unidirectional. They estimate this admixture episode's time of occurrence at within the past 200 years or eight generations. Social status and rehabilitation Like Siddhi populations across the sub-continent, Siddhis in Karnataka also have remained isolated, and economically and socially neglected. In 1984, at the instance of the Secretary of the Rural Welfare Trust, Dandeli and few others, an \\"All-Karnataka Siddi Development Association\\" was formed to bring Siddhis together and work for their integrated development. K. V. Subbanna, the Magsaysay awardee also made some efforts in this direction with his Ninasam. On 8 January 2003, the Union government brought the Siddis under the list of Scheduled Tribes with a view to empowering them constitutionally. Further, policies to provide homes for homeless Siddis, water facilities, education, employment opportunities, roads, electricity, mobile hospitals of land to each Siddi family and the right to collect forest products were also endorsed by parliament. It is hoped that proper implementation of these policies would go a long way in helping the Siddhi community enhance their social and economic status. Internationally too, awareness of sub-Saharan African diaspora in the east has been limited. In 2006, however, 'The African Diaspora in Asia'(TADIA), a UNESCO backed initiative has also evinced interest in the rehabilitation of this tribe. Headed by Prof Angenot of Brazil, it has become the academic link between the Siddis of Karnataka, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh and other research scholars. It aims at involving academic research, promoting cultural exchanges and raising funds for education and employment generation programmes for the Siddis. Trivia * According to B. G. L.

He went on to write that interrogators used the mere threat of being sent there to intimidate prisoners, and there was no way to question those who had been there as they either had been driven mad or were dead.Solzhenitsyn, Gulag Archipelago, 181. He described the prison as comprising two buildings: one in which the prisoners were housed and the other containing 68 monastic cells where interrogations took place. The food was said to be the best of all the political prisons since the food was brought over from the nearby Architects' Rest Home, but the food ration for one architect in the home was divided among twelve prisoners and the prisoners were frequently tortured, deprived of sleep and kept in solitary confinement, including in small, closet-like cells where they could not sit down or move; they were also left in hot and cold rooms to sweat or freeze, and were not allowed exercise outdoors.Solzhenitsyn, Gulag Archipelago, 181-184. Cases NKVD head N. I. Yezhov was imprisoned in Sukhanovka beginning on 10 April 1939 and was interrogated there by the Main Military Procurator, N. P. Afanasyev. His trial took place in the office of the chief of the prison in February 1940, although he was executed in Moscow, on Varsonofevskii Lane, not far from the Lubyanka prison.Jensen and Petrov, Stalin's Loyal Executioner, 187. Solzhenitsyn wrote that Deputy Minister of State Security M. D. Ryumin used to personally beat and otherwise torture prisoners in a spacious office at the prison, making certain to cover the nice Persian carpet with a cloth so as not to spatter it with the prisoners' blood.Solzhenitsyn, Gulag Archipelago, 126.

Birth and Early Life  Santa Shishunala Sharifa was born on 7 March 1819 in Shishuvinahala, a village in Shigganvi taluk (in Haveri district), Karnataka. He was the son of an Imam Saheb, who was a disciple of Hajaresha Qadri, whose dream it was to unite Hinduism I and Islam. Hajaresha Qadri used to give ‚ÄúLinga Deeksha‚Äù, or initiation by tying a linga around the neck of a disciple, as per the Hindu Lingayat tradition. His father used to teach him Ramayana, Mahabharata, and even the teachings of Allama Prabhu. Legend has it that Shishunala Sharifa was conceived with the blessings of Basavanna. Even when Shishunala was a boy, He was taught the tenets of both religions. In his birthplace Shishuvinahala, even today, both Hindus and Muslims revere him as a saint at the same temple.  Meeting Govinda Bhatta  Govinda Bhatta, a Brahmin, was famous in the region as an unconventional Master. He cared little for caste or religion, and He used to spend time with anyone who invited him, and ate anywhere He felt like eating. Other Brahmins could not stomach His way of life. One day, Govinda Bhatta came to Shishuvinahala, and Sharifa‚Äôs father found Him seated under a tree. He asked Him to accept His son as disciple. In front of the father, Govinda Bhatta called the young boy and said, ‚ÄúHey Sharifa, who is your father?‚Äù The villagers laughed, but were shocked when the boy brashly said, ‚ÄúWhat kind of question are you asking? Your father and mine are the same!‚Äù. Govinda Bhatta laughed, patted the boy on the back and said, ‚ÄúExcellent, Sharifa! The land is fertile, the seed will sprout well. O Imam, leave Him to my care! From today, He is my son!‚Äù Sharifa followed Govinda Bhatta back to His village. The boy was found to be curious about matters beyond logic and the world, and about the secrets of creation. These qualities were nurtured by Govinda Bhatta. Society was surprised by their closeness. In the eyes of Muslims, the Master was a Kaafir (infidel) and for Brahmins, the boy was a Mleccha(outsider). = Life Incidents =  The thorn bush  One day, Govinda Bhatta called all His young disciples to follow Him to the Temple. On the way, they were blocked by a thorn bush. Govinda Bhatta stepped on the bush with His slippers and climbed to the other side. The disciples, however, were bare-footed. Govinda Bhatta tossed His slippers across to them, but they hesitated. ‚ÄúA Master‚Äôs Padukas must be kept on the head, not worn on the feet‚Äù, they said. Bhatta looked at Sharifa, and said, ‚ÄúWill you at least join me?‚Äù Sharifa, without hesitation, puts on the slippers and crosses over. The two of them leave the others behind and go to the temple alone. Thread Ceremony One day, Govinda Bhatta was seated with some Brahmins at the village crossroad. Just then, Sharifa comes by. The Master calls Him to sit, and the two sit very closely. The others were offended, and say, ‚ÄúDoes that Muslim look like a Brahmin to you? You have no sense of cleanliness or social status!‚Äù Bhatta laughs, saying, ‚ÄúJust because you are born a Brahmin, do you think you‚Äôll become one? None of you is a greater Brahmin than this boy!‚Äù. He takes off His sacred thread puts it around Sharifa, embracing Him tightly. Sharifa, overcome with feeling, prostrates himself at the Master‚Äôs feet. The Brahmins were highly offended. The Mullah One day, a Mullah asks Sharifa, ‚ÄúSo, I see you‚Äôve stopped coming to the mosque! Do you even remember what Namaz is?‚Äù To this, Sharifa calmly replies, pointing at His own body, ‚ÄúI dwell in this mosque, so why go and come? I am in constant worship of ‚ÄúI AM‚Äù, so what can be greater Namaz?‚Äù The Mullah was dumbstruck. Vomit incident One day, Govinda Bhatta was sick and vomited. Then he turned to Sharifa and asked \\"Keep this vomit so no man steps on it\\". Sharif thought that the place where no one should step on it, he understands mythology behind the Govind Bhatta words so it is said that Sharifa drank it.  Later years  Sharifa‚Äôs parents force Him to marry. Sharifa goes to Bhatta and asks, ‚ÄúIf I become a Samsari, won‚Äôt i get stuck in desire and illusion?‚Äù The Master replies, ‚ÄúWhy are you worried? Even in the worst rain, does wind become wet? Does light become soaked? So go and get married!‚Äù Sharifa married, and had a daughter. He joins work as a schoolmaster in Karadagi, to support the family. However, His wife passes away shortly. Sharifa‚Äôs neighbours adopt the child, and Sharifa quits His job. He starts participating in folk dramas, teaching simple lessons through daily experiences. Sharifa went through extreme poverty, often going without meals. However, Govinda Bhatta stood by Him through all His troubles. After Govinda Bhatta left His body, Sharifa lived on for another twenty years. When He started falling ill and realised His days were few, He decided to give up His body according to ‚ÄúSharana‚Äù tradition, in which ash is smeared on the body, and the feet of a Jangama, or Shaivite monk, are worshipped. The monk‚Äôs feet are then placed on the head, and life is given up. Nobody agreed, but on His insistence, a Jangama by name Hirematta Karibasavayya agreed. Shishunala Sharifa left His body on 3rd July 1889 AD. The people were left confused. Sharifa was born a Muslim but lived with Hindu. The leaders of both communities came together and agreed to perform the last rites as per both religions. The Quran was read simultaneously with the Hindu Mantras. A Samadhisthan was constructed in Shishuvinahala, in a vast compound. There, statues of both Govinda Bhatta and Sharifa are visited by both Hindus and Muslims, to this day. Shishunala Sharifa is known as the Kabir of Karnataka.  Teachings  * When the mind gets very involved in the world and becomes agitated, hit it with the hatchet and stop it. * The Word of knowledge given by the Master annihilates the mind, and makes all difficulties vanish. * As one would take good care of a horse, take care of the mind by feeding it with spiritual food. At times, whip it like a horse, so that it behaves in a manner pleasing to the Master. * This house (the body) moves around so much, yet through proper discipline, in this very house one can experience Shiva. * Jiva, like a bird in a cage, has freedom only within the cage of body and mind. But, by the Grace of the Master, the bird is able to spread its wings to fly through the entire universe. * The Holy Feet of his Master may look small and ordinary; however, they swallow up the huge ego when the head is placed at them. * I am not the human birth, but verily the Narayana Parabramha Sadashiva. (Na Na Embudu Nanalla) Shishunala Sharifa was known to compose poems as per the situation and sing them to spread the message. Though he never wrote down his compositions, by word of mouth many of them have been passed down to future generations.  Famous Compositions  # Kodagana koli nungitha nodavva thangi # Gudiya Nodiranna Dehada # Alabeda Thangi Alabeda # Tharavalla Thagi Ninna # Biddiyabbe Muduki # Soruthihudu Maneya Maaligi # Ellaranthavanalla Nanna Ganda # Mohada Hendathi Theerida Balika # Sneha Madabekinthavala # gudugudiya sedu nodo # lokada kalaji # Duddu Kettadu Nodanna #Na Na Embudu Nanalla  Film  Santha Shishunala Sharifa is a Kannada feature film directed by T.S. Nagabharana in 1990. The main character was played by the Kannada actor Sridhar, and supporting cast included Girish Karnad and Suman Ranganath Sharifa's songs have been sung by famous playback singers, notably C. Ashwath, Shimoga Subbanna and Raghu Dixit. Raghu Dixit's work has been appreciated for spreading the words of Sharifa's wisdom to the world. Raghu's self-titled debut album launched by the popular music director duo Vishal-Shekhar contains two songs \\"Soruthihudu Maniya Maligi\\" and \\"Gudugudiya Sedi Noda\\", which are compositions of Sharifa. His next album Jag Changa also has 2 songs originally written by Shishunala Sharifa \\"Lokada Kalaji\\" and \\"Kodagana Koli Nungitha\\".

It is among best-selling general interest newspapers in Spain. History and profile The brothers Ybarra y de la Revilla ‚Äì Fernando, Gabriel and Emilio ‚Äì founded El Pueblo Vasco (\\"The Basque People\\") on 1 May 1910, with Juan de la Cruz as founding editor. The paper supported Vizcaya's young Conservative Party and its editorial line was clerical, Alfonsist monarchist, free press and Basque regional autonomist. The paper's chief competitor in Bilbao was La Gaceta del Norte. Due to these conservative stances, El Pueblo Vasco was shut down by the Spanish Republic government on 17 July 1936, just before the Spanish Civil War. It was almost a year later, on 6 July 1937, when the paper published again, after the fall of Bilbao; it was joined on newsstands by El Correo Espa√±ol, the official newspaper of the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS, the Spanish fascist party, using the seized presses of the Basque nationalist daily Euzkadi. By order of caudillo Francisco Franco's government on 13 April 1938, the two papers combined as El Correo Espa√±ol-El Pueblo Vasco, owned by El Pueblo Vasco S.A. but controlled by the Falange. During the first 15 years of Francoist Spain, El Correo acquired its competitors El Noticiero Bilba√≠no (1939) and El Diario Vasco (1945). Upon this last purchase, the company's name was changed to Bilbao Editorial S.A. The year 1965 saw El Correo move to its current offices in Calle Pintor Losada, convert to tabloid format and increase the number of pages. In 1976, El Correo for the first time surpassed La Gaceta del Norte in sales, becoming the best-selling newspaper in northern Spain. Also around this time, publisher Javier de Ybarra y Berg√© was kidnapped and murdered by rogue elements of the Basque separatist organization ETA. Vatican had a share in El Correo until 1989. El Correo was the promoter of La Vuelta, the yearly bicycle race around Spain, between 1955 and 1978. However, due to ETA organising attacks on the race from the late 1960s, and increasing disorder around the race in the late 1970s during the Spanish transition to democracy, the Royal Spanish Cycling Federation banned the race from passing through the Basque Country, resulting in El Correo's announcement in January 1979 that it would no longer organise the race. It was subsequently promoted by the sports event company Unipublic and did not return to the Basque Country until 2011. Expansion The 1980s brought geographic expansion, as El Correo began to publish editions outside the Bilbao metro area and so it purchased El Diario Monta√±√©s, a newspaper in Santander. The paper now publishes nine local editions: five within the province of Vizcaya, which includes Bilbao, and one each serving the provinces of √Ålava, Guip√∫zcoa (sharing territory with El Diario Vasco), Burgos (in the city of Miranda de Ebro) and La Rioja. In April 2014, El Correo began to be published and distributed in the United Arab Emirates. El Correo, El Diario Vasco and El Diario Monta√±√©s are now owned by Grupo Vocento, a nationwide communications company that also owns ABC in Madrid and Las Provincias. The editor-in-chief of El Correo is Juan Carlos Mart√≠nez Gauna and its publisher is Bilbao Editorial. The paper is published in tabloid format. The daily comic strip Don Celes (by Luis del Olmo, originally published in La Gaceta del Norte) is now a symbol of the newspaper. In 2012 El Correo was named as the Newspaper of the Year in the category of regional newspapers by the European Newspapers Congress. Circulation The circulation of El Correo was 134,000 copies in 1993. It rose to 138,000 copies in 1994. Its circulation was 130,042 copies in 2002. It fell to 128,000 copies in 2003. The paper had a circulation of 112,588 copies in 2006. The 2008 circulation of the paper was 118,107 copies.

Education Daniel Freedman completed his undergraduate degree from Wesleyan University and completed his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1964. In 1967‚Äì68, Freedman was a member of the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study, and returned subsequently in 1973‚Äì74 and 1986‚Äì87. He was appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1980 and joint Professor of Physics in 2001. Before joining MIT, he was a professor at Stony Brook University. Supergravity In 1976, Daniel Z. Freedman codiscovered (with Sergio Ferrara and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen) supergravity. Freedman and van Nieuwenhuizen were on the faculty of the Stony Brook University. Supergravity generalizes Einstein's theory of general relativity by incorporating the then-new idea of supersymmetry. In the following decades it had implications for physics beyond the Standard Model, for superstring theory and for mathematics. For his work on supergravity, Freedman, a former Sloan and twice Guggenheim fellow, received in 1993 the Dirac Medal and Prize, in 2006 the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics,Discovery of Supergravity at Stony Brook Recognized by the APS Dannie Heineman Prize. in 2016 the Majorana MedalDaniel Z.

Freedman also gave the 2002 Andrejewski Lectures in Mathematical Physics at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. Research interests Daniel Freedman is a professor at MIT. His research is in quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and superstring theory with an emphasis on the role of supersymmetry. His most recent area of concentration is the AdS/CFT correspondence in which results on the strong coupling limit of certain 4-dimensional gauge theories can be obtained from calculations in classical 5-dimensional supergravity.

It is part of the Links series and was released for Microsoft Windows in 2002. It follows Links 2001 and was followed by Links 2004. The game includes six courses, a course designer, and four professional golfers: David Toms, Jesper Parnevik, Sergio Garc√≠a, and Annika S√∂renstam. Links 2003 introduces a golf swing method that works in real time as the player makes the shot. Links 2003 received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to Metacritic. Critics praised the graphics, the game physics, the multitude of game options, and the introduction of a real-time swing. However, the game's environments were considered to be stagnant and lifeless. Gameplay Links 2003 features six golf courses: Gleneagles, Ocean Club at Cabo del Sol, Lodge at Kauri Cliffs (New Zealand), Cambrian Ridge, The Tribute at Otsego Club, and the fictional oceanside location of Skeleton Coast set in Africa. Courses from previous Links games can be converted for play in Links 2003. Nine golfers are featured, including five generic characters. The game includes four professional golfers: David Toms, Jesper Parnevik, Sergio Garc√≠a, and Annika S√∂renstam. The player has various options for customizing the golfer. Links 2003 also includes the Arnold Palmer Course Designer 1.5, allowing the player to create custom golf courses. The player can also add WAV sound files into the game. Game modes include best ball, match, Nassau, scramble, skins, and stroke. Also included is a career mode, in which the player works their way up from qualifying school to world champion. The Mode of Play Designer gives the player numerous options for customizing the various game modes. Several golf swing methods are featured, including traditional two-click and three-click options, and the PowerStroke option. The game introduces the Real-Time Swing (RTS), in which the player uses the motion of the computer mouse to simulate the swing, which is performed in real time as the player makes the shot. A colored grid and the Green Analyzer both aid the player when putting on the green. Links 2003 includes lessons for beginner players, and advice is offered throughout the game. Various multiplayer options were offered at the time of the game's release, including Microsoft Gaming Zone, and tournaments arranged between players through e-mail. In addition, the online Links Tour allowed the player to compete against up to 63 other golfers in tournaments. A matchmaking service was also provided for players. Development and release Links 2003 was announced by Microsoft on February 27, 2002, at the International Games Festival in Las Vegas. The game was developed by Microsoft. The Arnold Palmer Course Designer 1.5 is the same tool used by the development team to create the game's six courses. In addition, the greens were recreated through 500 GPS points that were taken on the actual golf courses. The game features improved game physics over its predecessor. In an effort to achieve realism in the game, lead designer Mark McArthur said, \\"We had [programmers] with hard hats out in the driving range, and they would watch the balls fly toward them.\\" It is the first game in the Links series to feature 3D polygonal golfers, rather than the digitized FMV golfers featured in previous games. The golfers are made of approximately 7,500 polygons. Garc√≠a and Parnevik participated in motion capture sessions to create their onscreen golfers. Each of the professional golfers also provided their voices for the game. Links 2003 was completed in early September 2002, and was released in the United States later that month. It was published by Microsoft Game Studios. Links 2003 was accompanied by a separate game titled Links 2003 Championship Courses, which features the same courses and also includes 20 courses from previous Links games. In the United Kingdom, Links 2003 and Links 2003 Championship Courses were released on October 11, 2002. A bundle set, consisting of Links 2003 and Links 2003 Championship Courses, was released in 2003 under the title Links 2003 Championship Edition. Reception Links 2003 received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to Metacritic. Some critics considered it the best golf game available. The graphics were praised, especially the golfers. The physics were also praised, with Andy Mahood of GameSpy calling them the best of any golf game available. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer called it \\"unquestionably the most realistic golf simulation ever offered on any platform\\" and wrote that the game engine \\"allows for almost every variable - we couldn't think of anything it doesn't do.\\" Praise was given for the multitude of game options, including the various multiplayer features, although some critics were disappointed by the limited number of professional golfers. Critics considered the game's environments to be stagnant and lifeless, particularly due to the stillness of water, clouds, and the golf crowd. Ivan Sulic of IGN criticized the lack of flying birds, and wrote, \\"It's like playing in an episode of the Twilight Zone where nothing is alive\\". Gord Goble of GameSpot also criticized the lack of birds, and wrote, \\"Opposing players don't move a muscle when they're in view. Neither do the spectators, even when you can hear them applauding. Trees don't bend, tall grass doesn't sway, and clouds remain perfectly still.\\" Michael Lafferty of GameZone wrote, \\"The wind may be blowing, but tree branches are not moving. And there isn't a ripple on those beautiful, reflective water surfaces, nor do the clouds move. The gallery is a bunch of frozen folks that applaud without moving a muscle.\\" Chris Johnson of Sports Gaming Network criticized the lack of an atmospheric golfing environment, and wrote, \\"This creates the rather odd predicament that Links 2003 does some things much better than other golf simulations but fails miserably at others - so much so that it detracts greatly from the overall gameplay value.\\" Bramwell wrote that the overall game \\"feels lifeless to play, even though it's one of the most calculating and downright realistic simulations of any sport to date - a real shame.\\" Mahood considered the only issue with the graphics to be the \\"decidedly static water renderings\\". AM Urbanek of Extended Play called the game environments \\"excruciatingly static\\". The addition of a real-time swing was praised. Mahood called it a \\"much overdue\\" feature, and Dan Morris of PC Gamer wrote, \\"With a mouse-swing as natural and lifelike as the one in Links 2003, the series is reawakened.\\" Jeff Lackey of Computer Gaming World wrote that Microsoft \\"has delivered a solid game with Links 2003, and with the new RTS, it has retained its title as the king of the golf sims.\\" Critics were disappointed that the game's Dynamic camera view does not work when using the real-time swing. Some critics were disappointed by the minimal ambient noise, and the lack of golf commentary. Urbanek considered the sound to be weakest aspect of the game, and wrote that \\"when playing along a coastal cliff, the absence of the roar of the surf is just strange.\\" Mahood stated that the audio clips of golfers' post- shot reactions did not always align well. Goble stated that the applause and cheers from the crowd \\"are erraticaccompanying some shots, not accompanying other equally good shots, and suddenly pouncing at full blast rather than ebbing and flowing as real crowd reactions would do.\\" Johnson also complained of erratic crowd reactions, and stated that the audio \\"fails miserably when it tries to re-create the atmosphere of a tournament event.\\" Some critics noted issues in which the game would freeze, while other critics stated that the game played fine when tested on multiple computers. Bramwell considered the lock-up glitches to be \\"easily the most damning thing\\" about the game. Goble wrote that much of the game felt sluggish, while Sulic stated that the game would play slowly on older computers. Johnson complained of slow screen redrawing, and Keith Pullin of PC Zone stated that the screen redraw could take up to 30 seconds on less-powerful computers.

He is renowned for the discovery of theories introducing supersymmetry as a symmetry of elementary particles (super-Yang‚ÄìMills theories, together with Bruno ZuminoS. Ferrara, B. Zumino, Supergauge Invariant Yang-Mills Theories, Nucl.Phys.B79:413,1974) and of supergravity, the first significant extension of Einstein's general relativity, based on the principle of \\"local supersymmetry\\" (together with Daniel Z. Freedman, and Peter van NieuwenhuizenD.Z. Freedman, P. van Nieuwenhuizen, S. Ferrara, Progress Toward a Theory of Supergravity, Phys. Rev. D 13:3214-3218,1976). He is an emeritus staff member at CERN and a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.  Career  Sergio Ferrara was born on 2 May 1945 in Rome, Italy. He graduated from the University of Rome in 1968 but he didn't earn a Master Degree nor a PhD as that was not present at the time in Italian high education system. Since then he has worked as a CNEN and INFN researcher at the Frascati National Laboratories; as a CNRS Visiting Scientist at the Laboratoire de Physique Th√©orique, √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, Paris, and at the Theory Division at CERN, Geneva. In 1980 he was nominated Full Professor of theoretical physics in Italy. He became a staff member of the Theory Division at CERN in 1981. In 1985, he became a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Since 1986 he has been a senior staff member of the Physics Department at CERN. During the years 2010-2014 he has been a Guest Professor at CERN as Principal Investigator of the European Research Council Advanced Grant SUPERFIELDS. He is currently a senior staff member, emeritus, at CERN. Conformal Field Theory In 1971‚Äì1975, Sergio Ferrara did pioneering work on Conformal Field Theory and the Conformal bootstrap. In a series of papers written in collaboration with Raoul Gatto, Aurelio Grillo and Giorgio Parisi, he studied constraints imposed by conformal symmetry on the operator dimensions, the form of the correlation functions, the operator product expansion, and the conformal partial wave expansion for the four-point correlation functions of the theory.Sergio Ferrara, Raoul Gatto, A. F. Grillo, Conformal Algebra in Space-Time and Operator Product Expansion, Annals of Physics 76 (1973) 161 This work, together with the similar work by Alexander Polyakov, laid the foundations of Conformal Field Theory. Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory In 1974, with Bruno Zumino, he formulated supersymmetric gauge theories, which opened the way to building supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics and exploring their consequences. This result was obtained independently by Abdus Salam and James Strathdee. Supergravity In 1976, Sergio Ferrara, Daniel Z. Freedman, and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen discovered Supergravity at Stony Brook University in New York. It was initially proposed as a four-dimensional theory. The theory of supergravity generalizes Einstein's general theory of relativity by incorporating the principles of supersymmetry. In 2019 the three were awarded a special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics of $3 million for the discovery. Black-Hole Attractors In 1995,with Renata Kallosh and Andrew Strominger, he formulated the theory of Black Hole attractors, a dynamical mechanism which determines the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for extremal Black- Holes in term of their charges.

He was a younger son of John I of Beirut. His elder brother, Balian, inherited Beirut. He served as regent of Jerusalem on two occasions: 1253‚Äì1254 for Conrad II and 1256‚Äì1258 for Conrad III. He was lieutenant for the regent on three occasions: 1247‚Äì1248 and 1249‚Äì1252 for Henry I of Cyprus and 1258 for Plaisance of Antioch. John strengthened the existing fortifications of Arsuf in 1241. In that year he co-signed a letter with his cousin, Philip of Montfort, and Geoffrey of Estraing to the Emperor Frederick II, nominal regent of Jerusalem. The letter, which had the encouragement of Richard of Cornwall behind it, proposed that Frederick pardon all baronial rebels and create Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, bailiff. The barons would in turn swear oaths to Simon and recognise his authority until the young king, Conrad II, came of age (1243). It was refused. John, like his father, was learned in law and he re-used some of the legal arguments which his father had employed in his long career. In February 1251, shortly after becoming the lieutenant (bailli) of Jerusalem on behalf of the regent, Henry of Cyprus, John called a council of liegemen in the palace of his relatives, the lords of Beirut, in Acre. There he proposed that the courts employ scribes to keep written records in the French language and that the Haute Cour of Jerusalem should do the same, sealing their records in a locked chest, the keys to which were to be held by the regent or his lieutenant and two elected liegemen. These reforms were accepted by the barons. The reform of the burgess court was enacted by 1269, but the reform of the Haute Cour was put off until 1286. While the Seventh Crusade drew Muslim soldiers away from Palestine, John led an expedition against Bethsan in early 1250. He devastated a nearby camp and captured 16,000 animals and one emir. In 1252, John witnessed the creation of two new gates in the Hospitaller complex in Acre and the consequent creation of a new public road. In 1253 John succeeded Henry of Cyprus as regent for a few months until 1254 on behalf of the absentee king Conrad. In 1256 he was again appointed regent for the minor Conrad III. In 1257 he confirmed a treaty with the city of Ancona granting it commercial rights in Acre in return for aid of fifty men-at-arms for two years. Though Ancona was an ally of the Republic of Genoa and John sought by his treaty to bring the feudatories ‚Äî most of whom were onside ‚Äî to support Genoa against Venice in the War of Saint Sabas, his plan ultimately backfired and John of Jaffa and John II of Beirut engineered a coup to make Plaisance of Antioch, the estranged wife of John's son Balian, bailiff on behalf of the regent Hugh II of Cyprus. John accepted the coup and reconciled with Plaisance and Bohemond VI of Antioch. When Plaisance returned to Cyprus he was again put in charge as lieutenant. In 1258 he negotiated the treaty between the military orders, the Hospitallers, Templars, and Teutonic Knights, which regulated their relationship. He was succeeded as constable on his death by his lieutenant, Geoffrey of Sergines, appointed by Plaisance. He had married Alice, daughter of Rohard of Haifa. His son and successor in Arsuf was Balian. References *Marshall, Christopher. Warfare in the Latin East, 1192‚Äì1291. Cambridge University Press, 1992. *Riley-Smith, Jonathan.

Both traditional and contemporary big band jazz arrangements make up the programs of the three ensembles. Produced by the UDC Jazz Studies Program and the Felix E. Grant Jazz Archives, the festival began in 1987 as part of a citywide tribute to Duke Ellington and was originally called the University BIG BAND Jazz Festival. In 2004 the official name of the festival was changed to the Calvin Jones BIG BAND Jazz Festival, in memory of Calvin Jones, director of UDC's Jazz Studies program and a legendary figure in the Washington, D.C. community. In subsequent years the festival has been organized as A Tribute to Count Basie (1988); A Celebration of the 25th Anniversary of the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area (1991); A Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie and Dr. George Ross (1993) ; and A Tribute to Felix Grant (1994). April 1996 marked the 10th Anniversary of the festival, and in 1999, UDC joined the city in celebrating the 100th Anniversary of Duke Ellington's birth. Since 2002 the festival has celebrated Jazz appreciation month (JAM) - an initiative launched by the Smithsonian Institution that serves as an annual affirmation of jazz.

On Monday, April 28, 2008 the jazz ensembles from the University of the District of Columbia (directed by Allyn Johnson), Howard University (directed by Fred Irby III) and the University of Maryland (directed by Chris Vadala) celebrate the festival's 22nd year. BET on Jazz, the Cable Jazz Channel taped the 1998 festival and aired the program on BET on Jazz's-Jazz Scene. Washington D.C.'s Jazz Messenger-WPFW 89.3 FM broadcasts the festival live. UDC Cable Television in cooperation with the D.C. Office of Cable Television and Telecommunications tapes the festival for broadcast on UDC Cable Television. These broadcasts continue to give exposure to a festival that has been supported by area audiences since 1987.

She was a member of the Northwest School. In the early days of her career, gender bias was alive and well among the Northwest art establishment, which tended to treat her like a housewife with pretensions. Chase had a substantial career as a painter and sculptor before she set off for New York, where she made groundbreaking videos. Pursuing her art was easier in New York than in the Northwest, where she endured considerable condescension for being female. Her subsequent art, which often championed the cause of women, is some indication of the pain such prejudice caused. Early years Chase was born Doris Mae Totten, the only daughter of a Seattle attorney. She attended Ravenna Grade School, and graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1941. She studied architecture at the University of Washington and pledged Chi Omega before dropping out of college in 1943 to marry Elmo Chase, a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. She became seriously ill after Gary's birth, suffering what was then termed a \\"nervous breakdown.\\" The cause of the emotional collapse was clear to her: \\"I was doing everything except what I wanted to do, which was to paint.\\" Encouraged by a counselor, she began to take time to paint. She studied oil painting briefly with the Russian artist, Jacob Elshin, and with the Greek artist, Nickolas Damascus. She took a class with Northwest artist Mark Tobey. She was very encouraged when, in 1948, one of her paintings was accepted into the Northwest Annual Exhibition. When son Gary was 3 years old, and Doris was pregnant again, Elmo contracted polio and became almost totally paralyzed. At the same time, they were building a house (Doris Chase was the architect) that was two-thirds finished. To support the family, Chase taught painting and design at Edison Technical School; art collector Virginia Wright was one of her students. Chase was accepted into Women Painters of Washington in 1951. Chase remained a member until the mid-1960s. Northwest art Chase's early paintings were Northwest landscapes and figures, often musicians, in blocks of color. She favored heavy oil surfaces, sometimes building them up with sand to achieve coarse texture. She credits inspiration for her style to the structured designs of Northwest Coast Native American basketry and carving. Northwest painter Kenneth Callahan, in an article for The Seattle Times, reviewed Chase's first solo exhibition in 1956 at the Otto Seligman Gallery, and called Chase \\"a serious and talented young painter.\\" In 1961, Chase was invited to show at Galleria Numero in Florence, Italy. Subsequent shows were in New York and in Japan, where a writer for Tokyo Shimbun compared her work to Japanese sumi painting. Chase was accepted into the Huntington Hartford Foundation's artists' colony in Pacific Palisades, California, in 1965, 1966, and 1969, each time for a month. From early wash drawings, her work evolved into a series of cement paintings meant for outdoor use, inscribed with faces, and words like \\"joy\\" and \\"love.\\" Chase experimented with painting on shaped canvases when one of her students gave her some pieces of laminated oak. Her first solo New York exhibition, in 1965, at the Smolin Gallery, contained paintings on wood. She exhibited a series of small painted sculptures inset with hinged sections which opened to reveal additional painted section. Soon the painted pieces and laminated wood shapes became large. She sculpted pieces that weren't fixed in a position, but rather invited viewers to participate in rearranging modules. Many of the forms, such as a black-stained fir piece titled Haida, resembled the look of Northwest Coast Native American art. Chase felt the inspiration came from pieces she'd seen at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition (of 1909) that were on the University of Washington campus when she attended classes there. Meanwhile, some of the hoops and circles, arches and ellipses Chase created had grown large enough to be walked through, allowing people to interact with them. While sculpture was still considered a man's work in the 1960s, Chase showed that women could create in this medium as well. Totten Chase's Changing Form sculpture in Seattle's Kerry Park An early steel sculpture, the tall Changing Form, was commissioned for Kerry Park on Queen Anne Hill, becoming one of Seattle's most highly regarded public sculptures. In 1968, dancer Mary Staton used a set of Chase's giant wooden circles for her choreography. The dancers rocked upside down in enormous wooden arcs, and spread-eagled like spokes inside wooden hoops, wheeled across the stage of the Seattle Opera House. In collaboration with Boeing, Chase produced Circles, a computer film based on the spinning hoops. King Screen made a film of the dance and sculpture collaboration. Chase requested and received footage edited out of the King Screen film, and from the cut footage, made her own film, Circles II, with the help of film professionals Bob Brown and Frank Olvey. Using color separations that showed the dancers and sculpture as color forms, Chase used time lapse so that trails of light followed the wake of dancers' arms and legs. The film was acclaimed at the 1973 American Film Festival in New York with critic Roger Greenspun comparing it to Matisse's Dance painting. At about the same time Circles II was in production, Chase created prototypes of kinetic sculptures for children, made of shaped urethane foam encased in tough, bright-colored fiberglass cloth. The shapes were designed for kids to help them with equilibrium and body awareness. Choreographer Jean Erdman also used Chase‚Äôs kinetic sculpture in her dance Rapid Transits (1972). They were also featured, along with Chase‚Äôs computer synthesized films in Op Odyssey (1976) choreographed by Valerie Hammer with music composed by Robert Mahaffay and lighting design by George Gracie. This multi-media dance work based on the eponymous poem by West Coast poet, Diane Wakowski was produced by and premiered at Theater of The Open Eye in New York, toured extensively throughout the US, won first prize for Best Company at the 1977 Festival d‚ÄôAutomne at the Th√©√¢tre de Champs Elys√©es in Paris and was eventually presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Midlife career After 28 years of marriage, Chase filed for divorce, ready to live alone and devote herself to art. She moved to New York in 1972. She rented room 722 at the Chelsea Hotel, which, since 1883 had been a residence for artists, including Sarah Bernhardt, O. Henry, Janis Joplin, Jasper Johns, and Mark Twain. Dylan Thomas died there, while Arthur C. Clarke wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey there. Arthur Miller and Virgil Thomson were in residence when Chase arrived. Impressed with Circles II, school administrators at Columbia University invited Chase to teach a graduate-level course in the film and video department. She declined, not wanting to be tied to anything other than creative work. Chase began working in video in the early 1970s, using computer imaging, when video art was new. Chase was encouraged by the video artist, Nam June Paik, to explore video art and during 1973 to 1974, she participated in the Experimental Television Center‚Äôs Residency Program.Doris Chase's artworks can be found in the Experimental Television Center Archive, in the Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art, Cornell University Library Chase began working in video in the early 1970s, using computer imaging, when video art was new. She began by integrating her sculptures with interactive dancers, using special effects to create dreamlike work. Victor Ancona said of Chase's dance videos, \\"Watching her tapes gave me the feeling of being transported to an enchanted, phosphorescent environment unceasingly in flux, a voyage I will long remember\\". The \\"phosphorescent environment\\" that so impressed Ancona was the Northwest's iridescent light shown for the first time as art turned video. As a video artist, Chase lectured and showed her work abroad under the auspices of the United States Information Agency, for which she traveled to India, Europe, Australia, South America, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Working with light as her medium, with dancers turned into flowing colored shapes, Chase brought the Northwest sensibility to video. Her particular favorite was a pale blue, similar to the color of the sky in a summer sunset. Highly sensual, her work is fluid and stable while exploring movement in the context of abstract architecture. Chase formed a romantic and professional relationship with composer George Kleinsinger, and he composed the music for 12 of her videos. In the 1980s, Chase used video to explore other concerns such as a divided mind using a split image, multiple superimpositions suggesting compromises, the drift mode suggesting insecurity. In Glass Curtain (1983), actress Jennie Ventriss anguished over her mother's mental and physical deterioration from Alzheimer's disease. Chase's most widely shown work is a series of 30-minute video dramas regarding older women's autonomy, titled By Herself. Table for One (1985), stars Geraldine Page in a voice-over monologue of a woman uneasy about dining alone, followed by Dear Papa (1986), starring Anne Jackson and her daughter Roberta Wallach. The third video was A Dancer (1987). Still Frame (1988) featured Priscilla Pointer and Robert Symonds. Sophie (1989) featured Joan Plowright as a woman who has just left her philandering husband to become \\"Sophie, reader of French tarot cards\\". The first two videos were presented at the Berlin and London Film Festivals in 1985 and 1986. Dear Papa won First Prize at Paris' 1986 Women's International Film Festival. Later years Parke Godwin's novel A Truce with Time (1988, Bantam Books) is a fictionalized version of Chase's life during her New York years. While he was writing it, Chase made her own film about their relationship, Still Frame, produced at the American Film Institute. Art historian Patricia Failing also wrote a book about Chase, Doris Chase, Artist in Motion: From Painting and Sculpture to Video Art (1991, University of Washington Press). In 1989, Chase returned to Seattle, dividing her time between the East and West Coasts, working on video in New York and sculpture in Seattle. She began works in glass, sometimes combining it with steel. In 1993, Chase produced a video documentary about her home, the Chelsea Hotel. The Chelsea Hotel was originally conceived as New York's first major cooperative apartment house, owned by a consortium of wealthy families in 1883, becoming a hotel in 1905. Chase's video paid tribute to the building's 110th anniversary, and those who have called it home. In 1999, her four-piece bronze sculpture Moon Gates, 17 feet high, was installed at Seattle Center. New York's MoMA acquired her complete video and film works. The Seattle Art Museum has only one Chase work in its collection: a 1950s oil painting. Chase's work won honors and awards at 21 film and video festivals. Her work has a permanent place in the archives of New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). It is collected by major museums and art centers in several countries.

The first chart shows the Baal Shem Tov's close family: his closest relatives, by blood and by marriage. This is meant to clarify the various family relations mentioned in the Baal Shem Tov's biography. The second chart shows his descendants to the fourth generation. The Baal Shem Tov did not found a Hasidic dynasty proper, as his immediate successor was his student, Rabbi Dov Ber of Mezeritch, and not any of his descendants. Even so, the descendants of the Baal Shem Tov were revered.Even Yisra ºel, p.111, note 4. Eventually, some of them founded their own courts and dynasties. Notably, his grandson R. Baruch of Mezhbuzh established his Hasidic court stressing that he was the sole heir of the Baal Shem Tov, a controversial issue in his time, which eventually distanced him from many of his colleagues, including R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi and R. Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin.Alfasi, Yitschak, Ha-·∏§ozeh mi-Lublin, pp. 14-15, 73-75. Other descendants became allied by marriage to other powerful Hasidic dynasties (e.g. Chernobyl, Karlin-Stolin), producing many dynasties, including some of the dynasties still active today (e.g. Skver, Vizhnitz). Thus the family of the Baal Shem Tov can be considered a sort of Hasidic dynasty in its own right, and is often treated as such in reference works on Hasidic dynastiesSee Shem u-she ºerit, ha-·∏§asidut and Even Yisra ºel, which treat it as such. where it is sometimes referred to as the Mezhbuzh dynasty. (This term is sometimes used specifically for the dynasty of R. Baruch of Mezhbuzh, see Mezhbizh (Hasidic dynasty), or for an unrelated dynasty from Mezhbuzh: see Apta (Hasidic dynasty).) :R. is an abbreviation for the honorific \\"Rabbi\\".

Caecilians are legless, burrowing amphibians which mostly live in leaf litter, loose soil, under rocks and decaying logs. They are also found in agricultural fields and only surface during the monsoon. The body is elongated and smooth with a slimy skin. The smaller caecilians superficially resemble earthworms while the larger ones are often mistaken for snakes. However, they can be told apart from earthworms by the presence of eyes, teeth and skeleton and from snakes by the lack of scales on skin. The eyes in caecilians are not well developed which is most likely to be because of their burrowing life style. They are considered as rare which is apparently due to their subterranean habits. To see them one has to search carefully (usually by digging) and be at the right place and at the right time. There are few places where they are common, but, at least one species was reported to be abundant in agricultural fields in Kerala. The larger caecilians can resemble snakes, but their skin is smooth, not scaly. The Western Ghats Caecilians The Western Ghats of India are one of the global biodiversity hotspots, and a centre of caecilian diversity. Of the 39 described species of Caecilians from India, 26 are endemic. From distributional records it is apparent that the hot spot of known caecilian diversity in India is the Western Ghats. Of the 26 currently recognized Western Ghats species, most are known from the southern part of the range, including seven species endemic to this area. As far as is known, all Indian Caecilians are oviparous i.e. they lay eggs and have a free-living, aquatic larval stage except Gegeneophis seshachari. The smallest Indian caecilian is about in length (Gegeneophis krishni) and the longest is (Ichthyophis malabarensis). As per the available information, most caecilians are opportunistic feeders and feed on earthworms, termites, larvae and pupae of a variety of insects. The observation of the faeces of captive caecilians indicates that they may be detritivores i.e. feeding on dead and decomposed organic matter also. Despite more than 100 years of research in the region, the number of recognised Caecilian species in the Western Ghats is still increasing rapidly. Most of the Western Ghats caecilians were previously described from the southern part of the peninsula. However, moderate recent effort expended in the herpetologically-under-explored northern region has uncovered several new species. The current picture of caecilian biology in the northern Western Ghats is well illustrated by recent discoveries. In the last 18 months, five new species have been described from northern Karnataka and Maharashtra. We know almost nothing of their biology and they are all deficient of data regarding their conservation status. As per the recent reports about 31% of the amphibians of the world are on the verge of extinction. Many more species are yet to be discovered and if the situation remains the same then they will become extinct without our knowledge. These amphibians play a dual role in the food chain. They are predators which keep a check on the insect population and are also prey for a variety of other predators. Their decline is surely going to disturb the balance of the entire food chain which will ultimately affect human beings.

The name stems from the original location of the collection, which was housed at Windsor Castle. They can now be seen at Hampton Court Palace. The Portraits The Royal Collection includes 10 portraits as part of the set. They show the women at three-quarter length in various poses. Some women wear current fashions; others are draped in loose robes intended to evoke classical antiquity. Originally commissioned by Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, the first mention of the paintings is by Pepys, describing them in his diary as being hung in \\"the Duke of York's room\\" in 1668. A 1674 inventory lists them as in the ducal rooms at St.James Palace; and by 1688 they had moved to the \\"Princess's dressing room\\" at Windsor Castle. Moved to the Castle's state rooms during the eighteenth century, the Windsor beauties were transferred to Hampton court at some time prior to 1835. List of \\"Beauties\\" Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Gramont, c. 1663 The original set of \\"Beauties\\" painted by Lely include, depending on the source: *Frances, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox (n√©e Stuart; 1648-1702) *Elizabeth, Countess de Grammont (n√©e Hamilton; 1641-1708) *Jane Myddelton (n√©e Needham; 1646‚Äì92) *Margaret, Lady Denham (n√©e Brooke; c. 1647-67) (named Elizabeth in the cited printed sources [and in 18th century prints] but Margaret at the Royal Collection) *Frances, Lady Whitmore (n√©e Brooke; died 1690) *Mary, Countess of Falmouth and Dorset (n√©e Bagot; 1645‚Äì79) (named Elizabeth in the cited printed sources [and in 18th century prints] but Mary at the Royal Collection) *Henrietta, Countess of Rochester (n√©e Boyle; 1646-1687) *Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland (n√©e Villiers; c. 1641-1709) *Anne, Countess of Sunderland (n√©e Digby; c. 1646-1715) *Elizabeth, Countess of Northumberland (n√©e Wriothesley; 1646-1690) *Emilia Butler, Countess of Ossory (Melville omits this name, citing Ernest Law that the portrait previously identified by this name is actually Lady Falmouth.) *Madame Henrietta, Duchess of Orl√©ans The portraits for the first 10 names are included at the Royal Collection website as \\"probably commissioned by Anne Hyde, Duchess of York.\\" The Duchess of York does not figure in the above list often; but since she was largely responsible for the collection (and choosing the sitters), she was also painted as part of the series. Possibly a little flattery from Lely was responsible for this.

Michigan Avenue. Designed by Chicago-based Krueck and Sexton Architects, the building features interconnected interior spaces and an unusual ten-story faceted window wall that provides views of the Chicago skyline, Grant Park, and Lake Michigan. This window wall is built from 726 individual pieces of glass in 556 different shapes.\\"Light radiates throughout new home of Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies,\\" JUF News, November 16, 2007 The building also houses a 400-seat theater, space for community events and kosher catering facilities. Like the surrounding buildings, many constructed in the period of architectural innovation that followed the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, this building is forward-looking in its design and use of materials, while maintaining respect for its setting. Like the bays of its 19th- and 20th- century neighbors, the facets that create the fa√ßade‚Äôs dynamic crystalline form allow light to extend into the narrow building, while expanding the views enjoyed from inside. The geometry of the fa√ßade is unique because the surface is constantly tilting in three dimensions, resulting in individual units of glass that are parallelograms rather than rectangles. At the same time, the average size of each of the fa√ßade's individual panes of glass is consistent with the standard size of the windows in the buildings up and down Michigan Avenue. The Spertus building was the first new construction in the Historic Michigan Boulevard District after the area was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2002. The cost of the Spertus project was more than $50 million.Blair Kamin, \\"Blades of Glass,\\" Chicago Tribune, November 21, 2007.

It was not limited to Cusco only, but spread to other cities in the Andes, as well as to present day Ecuador and Bolivia. Many colonial Cusco School paintings are preserved, most of them currently at Cusco, but also in other areas of Peru, the town of Calamarca (Bolivia) and in museums of Brazil, United States and England. History The tradition originated after the 1534 Spanish conquest of the Peru,\\"The 'Cusquenha' Art.\\" National Historical Museum of Brazil. and it is considered the first artistic center that systematically taught European artistic techniques in the Americas. The Spanish contribution, and in general European, to the Cusco School of painting, is given from very early time, when the construction of the Cathedral of Cusco begins. However, it is the arrival of the Italian painter Bernardo Bitti in 1583, the one that marks a first moment of the development of Cuzque√±o art. This Jesuit introduces in Cusco one of the fashionable currents in Europe of then, the Mannerism, whose main characteristics were the treatment of figures in a somewhat elongated way, with the light focused on them. During his two stays in Cusco, Bitti was commissioned to make the main altarpiece of the church of his Order, replaced by another after the earthquake, and painted some masterpieces, as The Coronation of the Virgin, currently in the museum of the church of La Merced, and the Virgen del pajarito, in the cathedral. The Annunciation of the Virgin, painting by Luis de Ria√±o of 1632. Disciple in Lima of the Italian Angelino Medoro, Ria√±o was installed at Cusco to 1630, where his techniques and themes were very influential. Painting located at Museo Pedro de Osma de Barranco, Lima Another of the great exponents of Cusque√±o mannerism is the painter Luis de Ria√±o, born in Lima and a disciple of Italian Angelino Medoro. In the words of the Bolivians historians Jos√© de Mesa and Teresa Gisbert, authors of the most complete history of Cuzque√±o Art, Ria√±o lords in the local artistic environment between 1618 and 1640, leaving, among other works, the murals of the church of Andahuaylillas. Also it emphasizes in these first decades of the 17th century, the muralist Diego Cusihuam√°n, with works in the churches of Chinchero and Urcos. The Baroque in the Cuzque√±a painting is mainly the result of the influence of the Tenebrism trending through the work of Francisco de Zurbar√°n and of the use as a source of inspiration of the engravings with Felmish art from Antwerp. Marcos Ribera, born in Cusco in 1830, is the maximum exponent of this tendency. Five of apostles of him can be seen in the church of San Pedro, two in the altarpiece and another in a side reredos. The monastery of Santa Catalina of Arequipa keeps La Piedad, and that of St. Francis, some of the canvases that illustrate the life of the founder of the Order, belonging to various authors. The increasing activity of Indian-Quechua and mestizo painters towards the end of the 17th century, makes the term of Cusco School conform more strictly to this artistic production. This painting is \\"Cuzque√±a\\", otherwise, not only because it comes from the hands of local artists, but mainly because it moves away from the influence of the predominant trending in European art and follows its own path. This new Cuzque√±o art is characterized, in the thematic, by the interest in Costumbrista subjects as, for example, the procession of Corpus Christi, and by the presence, for the first time, of Andean flora and fauna. A series of portraits of Indian caciques and genealogical and heraldic paintings also appear. As for the technical treatment, there is a misunderstanding of the perspective added to a fragmentation of the space in several concurrent spaces or compartmentalized scenes. New chromatic solutions, with a predilection for the intense colors, they are another typical feature of the nascent pictorial style. An event occurred at the end-17th century, was decisive for the direction taken by Cuzque√±a painting. In 1688, after permanent conflicts, there is a rupture in the corporation of painters that ends with the removal of the Indian-Quechua and Mestizo painters due, according to them, to the exploitation they were subjected by their Spanish colleagues.Fane, pp. 39-40 From this moment, free of the impositions of the corporation, the Indian and mestizo artists are guided by their own sensibility and transfer to the canvas their mentality and their way of conceiving the world. The most famous series of the Cuzco School is undoubtedly that of the sixteen paintings of the Corpus Christi series, which originally were in the church of Santa Ana and are now in the Museum of Religious Art of the Archbishopric of Cusco, except for three that are in Chile. From an anonymous painter of the late-17th century (some researchers attribute them to the workshops of Diego Quispe Tito and Pumacallao), these canvases are considered true masterpieces because of the richness of their color, the quality of the drawing and how well they achieved the portraits of the main characters of each scene. The series has enormous historical and ethnographic value, because it shows in detail the various social strata of Colonial Cusco, as well as many other elements of a festival that already was central in the life of the city. The most original and important Indian painter is Diego Quispe Tito, born in the parish of San Sebasti√°n, near to Cusco, in 1611 and active almost until end the century. It is in the work of Diego Quispe Tito that some of the characteristics of Cuzque√±a painting will be prefigured, as a certain freedom in the handling of perspective, a previously unknown role of the landscape and the abundance of birds in the leafy trees that are part of the same. The motive of the birds, especially the Amazon forest's parrot, is interpreted by some researchers as it refers to the Inca nobility. The most valuable part of Quispe Tito's work is located in the church of his native town, San Sebasti√°n. Highlights the series of twelve compositions on the life of St. John the Baptist, in the main nave of the church. Of great mastery are also the two enormous canvases dedicated to Saint Sebastian, that of the asaetamiento and that of the death of the saint. Famous is, finally, the series of the Zodiac that the artist paints for the Cathedral of Cuzco towards 1680. The Virgin of Bethlehem of the city of Cusco, 17th century. Currently painting located in Cusco Another outstanding painter of Cusco School is Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao, of indigenous ancestry like Quispe Tito, but unlike him, much more attached to the canons of Western painting within the Baroque current. Active in the second half of the 17th century, Santa Cruz leaves the best of his work in the Cathedral of Cusco, as he is commissioned to decorate the walls on the side of the choir and the arms of the transept. In the picture of the Virgin of Bethelem, located in the choir, there is a portrait of the bishop and patron Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo that help quite to the developing of the Cusco Painting School and the city. Such is the fame reached by the Cusque√±a painting of the 17th century, which during the following century produces a singular phenomenon that, curiously, left its mark not only in art but in the local economy. We refer to the industrial workshops that make canvases in large quantities by order of merchants who sell these works in cities such as Trujillo, Ayacucho, Arequipa and Lima, or even in much more distant places, in the current Argentina, Chile and Bolivia. The painter Mauricio Garc√≠a, active towards the mid-18th century, signs, for example, a contract to deliver about five hundred canvases in seven months. Of course it was what was known as \\"ordinary\\" painting to differentiate it from the painting of fine brocateado, with a much more elaborate and colorful design. The most important artist of the 18th century is Marcos Zapata. His pictorial output, which spans more than 200 paintings, ranges between 1748 and 1764. The best are the fifty large canvases that cover the high arches of the Cathedral of Cusco and that are characterized by the abundance of flora and fauna as a decorative element. Authors The Cuzque√±a paintings were a form of religious art whose main purpose was didactic. The Spanish, who aimed to convert the Incas to Catholicism, sent a group of religious artists to Cusco. These artists formed a school for Quechua people and mestizos, teaching them drawing and oil painting. The designation \\"Cusque√±a,\\" however, is not limited to the city of Cusco or to indigenous artists, as Spanish creoles participated in the tradition as well. A major patron of the Cuzco artists was Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo, who collected European art and made his collection available to Peruvian artists. He promoted and financially assisted such Cusque√±a artists such as Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao, Antonio Sinchi Roca Inka, and Marcos Rivera.Fane, p. 38 Cusco School paintings were made by mestizos, Quecha-Indians and Whites-criollos. Style The defining characteristics of the Cusque√±a style are believed to have originated in the art of Quechua painter Diego Quispe Tito.Bethell, p. 742Bakewell, p. 268 Cusque√±a paintings are characterized by their use of exclusively religious subjects, their lack of perspective, and the predominance of red, yellow and earth colors. They are also remarkable for their lavish use of gold leaf,Fane, p. 40 especially with images of the Virgin Mary. Though the Cusque√±o painters were familiar with prints of Byzantine, Flemish and Italian Renaissance art, their works were freer than those of their European tutors; they used bright colors and distorted, dramatic images. They often adapted the topics to depict their native flora and fauna as a backdrop in their works. Warrior angels became a popular motif in Cusque√±a paintings. Most Cusque√±a paintings were created anonymously because of Pre-Columbian traditions that define art as communal. An exception is one of the last members of the Cuzco School, Marcos Zapata (c. 1710-1773). Other known artists of the Cuzco School include Diego Cusihuam√°n, Gregorio Gamarra, Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao (1635-1710), and Antonio Sinchi Roca Inka. Related to the school is the Master of Calamarca, in the 18th century, Bolivia. Collections The largest collection of paintings from the Cusco School is in the Cusco Cathedral. The Lima Art Museum and the Inca Museum also house important collections. Many works were destroyed in the 18th century so few Cusco School paintings remain. In recent years there has been a significant increase in demand from both Latin American art collectors and certain museums for paintings from the Cusco school period. In 2010, the American government repatriated two Cusco and Lima style paintings to Peru that had been illegally brought into the United States in 2005.

In addition to the paintings, they also do Indigenous photo montages on recreations of the paintings. According to them, the Cusco School is a symbol of the power of the colonizer \\"representing images with Caucasian features, imposing ideas, religion and Western stereotypes\\" and the project re-poses them with new signs that refer directly to the descendants of the former victims. These new paintings are also exhibited in many museums throughout the country. Throughout his life, the painter Ray Mart√¨n Abeyta created works inspired by the Cusco School style of Madonna painting, creating a hybrid of traditional and contemporary Latino subject matter representing the colonialist encounters between Europeans and Mesoamericans.

Early life Krafft von Dellmensingen was born into a lower ranking Bavarian noble family in Laufen, Upper Bavaria. His father was a royal notary. Konrad entered the Royal Bavarian Army as an officer candidate in August 1881 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in December 1883.

After helping prepare the army for the offensive, Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen was promoted to General der Artillerie and given command of the II Bavarian Army Corps, which he led from April 18, 1918 through the Spring Offensive and the defensive battles that followed to the war's end. Post-war Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen retired from the army in December 1918. He was active in monarchist circles after the war seeking a return of the Bavarian monarchy. He also participated in the 1920s in the preparation of the official history of the Bavarian Army in the war: in 1926 and 1928, he edited a 2-volume account of the Battle of Caporetto, Der Durchbruch am Isonzo (The Breakthrough on the Isonzo).Krafft von Dellmensingen, Konrad, (1) Der Durchbruch am Isonzo Teil I.: Die Schlacht von Tolmein und Flitsch (24.bis 27.

These were published as volumes 12a and 12b of the series Schlachten des Weltkrieges (Battles of the World War), which was published by Stalling of Berlin and Oldenburg, Germany. In 1937, a barracks complex in Garmisch-Partenkirchen was named the \\"Krafft-von-Dellmensingen-Kaserne\\". In 1945, the Kaserne was taken over by the United States Army. The program of denazification was launched after the end of the Second World War; the name ‚ÄúKrafft-von-Dellmensingen-Kaserne‚Äù was deleted. On 9 July 1975 this decision was reversed; the barracks were named after Dellmensingen again. Today this building houses part of the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies. The name \\"Krafft-von-Dellmensingen-Kaserne\\" was removed from the outside of the barracks on 29 June 2011. Krafft von Dellmensingen had died in Seeshaupt, Upper Bavaria.

It was followed in 2002 by Probability Space, which won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award. The novel concerns a military expedition to the planet World, where aliens live who have developed a strange form of telepathy or collective unconscious, \\"shared reality\\", which causes piercing \\"head-pain\\" whenever \\"Worlders\\" attempt to hold strongly differing opinions. However, the expedition concerns a crash-landed alien artifact in the planet's crust which has uncharted powers, and may be the key to humanity winning a war against the \\"Fallers\\", a genocidal alien race. Setting The Probability trilogy takes place in a galaxy that has been colonized by humans. This was made possible by the space tunnels, a network of FTL warp gates that were created by a now-lost progenitor race. Humanity is not united under a common government and political system; instead, the various governments in the Solar System and beyond have united as the \\"Solar Alliance Defense Network\\" in light of the war against the Fallers. The Terrans have also discovered a number of alien races, most of them vastly similar in body format, living conditions and even DNA, leading to the hypothesis that the aforementioned progenitor race seeded the galaxy with sentient life, which then evolved according to the conditions on each planet. Of the known alien races, humanity is the only one that has reached space. Humanity's understanding of the space tunnels is very limited, but several peculiar traits have been discovered. For one: if Ship A enters Tunnel 1, exits Tunnel 2 and then turns around and enters Tunnel 2 again, it will emerge from Tunnel 1 again... Unless Ship B emerges from Tunnel 2 in the interim, at which point Ship A will instead emerge from wherever Ship B entered. (The single tunnel leading to World is #438, which gives an idea of how carefully passage through heavily used tunnels must be coordinated.) For two, objects can only enter the Tunnel if they are below a certain mass, about 100,000 tons; anything larger will actually fit into the aperture, but will collapse and explode. The threshold of what the tunnel can handle is determined by the object's Schwarzschild radius. Finally, nobody knows how the tunnels work. At all. Macro-level quantum entanglement has been proposed, but it is so far out of the realm of current physics that nobody believes it. The space tunnels also lead to the discovery of the Fallers, an alien race who refused to establish communications and immediately launched a war, which they are winning. No Faller has been captured alivethey prefer to suicide or kamikazebut forensic examination of corpses indicate they evolved separately from humans, instead of being seeded by the progenitors. Like humanity, they were not an interstellar race until the discovery of a space tunnel in their system, though they have been closing the gap quickly. Unlike humans, they did not discover the tunnel independently; it was, in fact, a Terran craft emerging into their home system that catapulted them onto the interstellar stage. The Probability novels shares two technological quirks with another of Nancy Kress' trilogies, the Beggars trilogy: in both stories, use of both genetic modification and behavior-regulating neuropharmacological drugs is commonplace. \\"Genemods\\" are applied in vitro, whereas those who adhere to the \\"Discipline\\" administer \\"neuropharms\\" daily to control their neurotransmitter balances, in a mix that can be altered depending on the activities of one's day and the mood one hopes to approach it with. Plot synopsis While the human race struggles at war with the Fallers, an advanced alien race, an artifact is discovered which might be the key to a lost science, be a weapon itself, or a doomsday device.

Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War. Oxford: Osprey, 2007 It is located near the modern town of Salman Pak, Iraq. It is the only visible remaining structure of the ancient city of Ctesiphon. The archway is considered a landmark in the history of architecture, and is the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world.  History  The exact time of construction is not known with certainty. Some historians believe the founder is Shapour I who ruled Persia from 242 to 272 AD and some other believe that construction possibly began during the reign of Anushiruwan the Just (Khosrow I)Because of the vicissitudes of historical transmission, eventually no less than four Sasanian rulers were quoted as its builders: Shapur I (241‚Äì273), Shapur II (310‚Äì379), Khosrau I Anushirvan (531‚Äì579) and Khosrau II Parvez (590‚Äì628). after a campaign against the Byzantines in 540 AD. The arched iwan hall, open on the facade side, was about 37 meters high 26 meters across and 50 meters long, the largest man-made, free standing vault constructed until modern times.Wright, G. R. H., Ancient building technology vol. 3. Leiden, Netherlands. Koninklijke Brill NV. 2009. 237. Print. The arch was part of the imperial palace complex. The throne room‚Äîpresumably under or behind the arch‚Äîwas more than 30 m (110 ft) high and covered an area 24 m (80 ft) wide by 48 m (160 ft) long. The top of the arch is about 1 meter thick while the walls at the base are up to 7 meters thick. It is the largest vault ever constructed in the world. The catenary arch was built without centring. In order to make this possible a number of techniques were used. The bricks were laid about 18 degrees from the vertical which allowed them to be partially supported by the rear wall during construction. The quick drying cement used as mortar allowed the fresh bricks to be quickly supported by those that were previously laid. The Taq Kasra is now all that remains above ground of a city that was, for seven centuries‚Äîfrom the 2nd century BC to the 7th century AD‚Äîthe main capital of the successor dynasties of the Persian empire: Parthians and Sassanids. The structure left today was the main portico of the audience hall of the Sassanids who maintained the same site chosen by the Parthians and for the same reason, namely proximity to the Roman Empire, whose expansionist aims could be better contained at the point of contact. The structure was captured by the Arabs during the conquest of Persia in AD 637. They then used it as a mosque for a while until the area was gradually abandoned. In the early 10th century, the Abbasid caliph al-Muktafi dug up the ruins of the palace to reuse its bricks in the construction of the Taj Palace in Baghdad. The monument is also the subject of a poem by Khaqani, who visited the ruins in the 12th century. =Modern era= In 1851 French artist Eug√®ne Flandin visited and studied the structure with Pascal Coste who remarked \\"the Romans had nothing similar or of the type\\". In 1888, a serious flood demolished the greater part of the edifice. Taq Kasra: The Archway of Ctesiphon - http://www.amusingplanet.com/2016/03/taq-kasra-archway-of-ctesiphon.html In 1940, Roald Dahl, then undergoing pilot training at RAF Habbaniya near BaghdadGOING SOLO by Roald Dahl took an award-winning photograph using a Zeiss camera of the Arch of Ctesiphon in Iraq which was subsequently auctioned by the Dahl family to raise funds for the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre.http://www.e-reading-lib.com/bookreader.php/1010577/Dahl_-_Moi_Boy.html The photo made ¬£6,000. In his autobiography Boy he writes: : You may not believe it, but when I was eighteen I used to win prizes and medals from the Royal Photographic Society in London, and from other places like the Photographic Society of Holland. I even got a lovely big bronze medal from the Egyptian Photographic Society in Cairo, and I still have the photograph that won it. It is a picture of one of the so-called Seven Wonders of the World, the Arch of Ctesiphon in Iraq. This is the largest unsupported arch on earth and I took the photograph while I was training out there for the RAF in 1940. I was flying over the desert solo in an old Hawker Hart biplane and I had my camera round my neck. When I spotted the huge arch standing alone in a sea of sand, I dropped one wing and hung in my straps and let go of the stick while I took aim and clicked the shutter. It came out fine. The monument was in the process of being rebuilt by Saddam Hussein's government in the course of the 1980s, when the fallen northern wing was partially rebuilt. All works, however, stopped after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. From 2004 to 2008 the Iraqi government cooperated with the University of Chicago's Diyala Project to restore the site at a cost of $100,000.. The Ministry of Culture also invited a Czech company, Avers, to restore the site. This restoration was completed in 2017. On March 7, 2019, a partial collapse further damaged the Taq Kasra, just two years after its latest restoration was completed. Documentary film In 2017 Pejman Akbarzadeh, based in the Netherlands, made the first full-length documentary film about Taq Kasra: Taq Kasra: Wonder of Architecture. The monument had been in danger of ISIS attacks in 2015-2016; Akbarzadeh feared that it might be destroyed soon, and therefore felt urgency to film his documentary. The film explores the history and architecture of Taq Kasra with prolific scholars and archaeologists in various countries.

Hugh III of Cyprus and Jerusalem appointed Balian bailiff, effectively regent, of the kingdom upon returning to Cyprus in October 1276. Hugh's claim to the royal title, however, was disputed by Charles I of Naples, who sent Roger of Sanseverino to Acre as his bailiff in 1277. Balian initially refused to admit Roger into the citadel until papers signed by Charles, Mary of Antioch, and Pope John XXI were produced and the Knights Hospitallers and John of Versailles, Patriarch of Jerusalem, had refused to intervene.

It has often been said by biologists that in sexual differentiation in mammals, the female is the \\"default\\" developmental pathway, in the sense that elimination of any of several gene actions necessary for formation of male genitalia leads to the development of external female genitalia (though development of functional ovaries requires effective action of several less understood sex-specific genes). Two processes: defeminization, and masculinization, are involved in producing male typical morphology and behavior. Disruption of either of these processes in males produces female- typical development. The opposite is not true; disruption of normal sexual development in females does not lead to male-typical endpoints. Defeminization involves the suppression of the development of female typical morphology (development of the M√ºllerian ducts into the fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina) and behavioural predispositions. Masculinization involves the production of male typical morphology (development of the Wolffian ducts into male reproductive structures) and behavioural predispositions. Both defeminization and masculinization are required for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male. A brief version of the female default paradigm can be stated as follows: #A set of specific genetic instructions must be present and a series of differentiating events mediated by hormones must occur in order for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male. ##The Y chromosome, SRY, SOX9, and SF1 genes must be present and functional. ##Functional Leydig cells must form in the gonads. ##The Leydig cells must be able to produce testosterone. ##The target cells must have the hormone receptors to respond to the testosterone. The target cells of the external genitalia must have functional 5-alpha-reductase enzyme to convert some of the testosterone to more active dihydrotestosterone. ##There is some evidence that the brain must be exposed and respond to androgens either prenatally or early in life to produce characteristic mating behavior. This is well demonstrated in many animal species but remains mostly speculative with respect to humans. #To a large extent, each step builds on the previous. If anything goes wrong at any of the first four steps, the subsequent pathway of development results in female anatomy and behavior. #No ovarian organizing gene homologous to SRY has been discovered. Both sexes are exposed to maternal estrogen prenatally. No hormones have yet been discovered that are necessary early in life to produce female sexual development. Estrogen seems not to be necessary until puberty for purposes of differentiation. ##The full development of male characteristics also includes personal experience throughout life, determining gender identity, gender roles and sexual orientation. However, there is much debate on the balance between nature and nurture in the determination. History This paradigm dates back to the 1950s. Even stronger versions were commonly stated in the 1960s and 1970s. One version, perhaps most associated with John Money, (who termed it the Adam principle), held that additional steps in the cascade to male identity were the recognition by parents and doctor that the external genitalia were male, which resulted in a male sex assignment, which in turn resulted in a male sex of rearing by parents and society, which in turn (coupled with the reinforcing appearance of male genitalia) resulted in a male gender identity. At least by implication, female gender identity simply required a female sex of rearing and lack of an obvious penis. In Germany in the 1970s, G√ºnter D√∂rner extrapolated the cascade to include direct testosterone effect on the brain as necessary for a male gender identity and sexual orientation, proposing that transsexualism and or homosexuality in biological males could result from deficiency of prenatal or early postnatal testosterone effect on the brain.

History  The store in February 1969, July 1971 C.K. Tang, the founder, migrated from China and began his business from a provisional store in 1932. CK Tang's first stores were on River Valley Road, but in the 1950s, he purchased land on Orchard Road as he noticed that the expatriates from the Holland Village area would travel down this road to go downtown. When CK Tang bought the land, it was situated opposite a Chinese cemetery, which, under cultural conventions, was perceived to bring bad luck. The first retail presence on Orchard Road, TANGS is credited with sparking the transformation of the area into Singapore‚Äôs most famous shopping district. In 1982, C.K. Tang purchased the adjacent Tang Plaza, which currently houses the Singapore Marriott Hotel.http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sindt-singapore-marriott-hotel/ In the late 1980s and early 1990s one of CK Tang's sons, Tang Wee Sung took control of the store. He went on to become chairman of the company in 2000 after his father‚Äôs death, and his appointment gave rise to changed operating policies, such as permitting the store to remain open on Sundays and introducing marketing strategies to increase consumer choice. In the late 1980s and early 1990s one of CK Tang's sons, Tang Wee Sung took control of the store. He went on to become chairman of the company in 2000 after his father‚Äôs death.

Architecture  View at night (2007)The building form was influenced by traditional Chinese culture and architecture, modeled after the Palaces in the Forbidden City. The color scheme of C.K. Tang building mimics a traditional imperial palace, with the green roof tiles symbolizing the notion of growth and prosperity, the yellow facade symbolizing the color of royalty, and red columns representing happiness. The design follows the Chinese belief of ‚Äòfeng-shui‚Äô, a traditional Chinese philosophical system, which is prominent in the octagonal decorations consistent all over the building. The 8 sided shape is auspicious as the number ‚Äò8‚Äô, pronounced as ‚Äòfa¬¥ in Chinese dialect implies prosperity. Apart from the visually prominent octagonal roof form of the tower, there are actually several other instances of octagonal designs all over the building. These include the floor tiling, column base and ceiling decorations, and railings. Other features like the distinctive ‚Äòartichoke leaf‚Äô or ‚Äòxie-shan‚Äô roof, designed to repel rain as well as allow wind circulation within the structure. The ridges of the roofs are aligned with figures of miniature mythical creatures which is a symbolism of formidableness in Chinese culture, along with the stone statues of lions up-front. Prior to its 2012 transformation, TANGS occupied 15,000 square meters and boasted five selling floors, designed by New York-based Hambrecht Terrell International, noted for its work with Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy's.

He was born in South Kingstown, Rhode Island on March 31, 1982, but was raised in Wilmington, Massachusetts and Boca Raton, Florida. He has also worked as the lead singer and lead guitarist of folk pop duo This Is Ivy League and as half of the electrofunk duo GRVRBBRS. he is 2foot 12inch  Early life  Blackinton was born to Mary Jo Blackinton on March 31, 1982, in South Kingstown, Rhode Island. Born Ryland Sharp, his last name was changed to Blackinton at age 6 when his mother remarried Dennis Blackinton and he adopted Ryland, along with his younger brothers Alex and Connor. The Blackintons moved to Massachusetts and lived there for several years. Growing up in and around the local grunge scene, Blackinton developed an interest in music, particularly guitar. He received his first guitar at age 12. Blackinton cites Nirvana, Weezer, and Massachusetts locals Dinosaur Jr. as some of his musical influences from this time period. When Blackinton was 15, his family relocated to Boca Raton, Florida. Here, he attended Olympic Heights Community High School, where he also met future bandmate Alex Suarez. As Suarez was also interested in music, and a member of local band Kite Flying Society, the two quickly became friends. They wrote a few songs together that, while never recorded or played then, would go on to become the first songs for This Is Ivy League. While in high school, Blackinton played with a few different bands, but he rarely stayed in any of them for very long. It was also in high school that Blackinton began his involvement with theatre. This involvement spurred Blackinton to attend Florida State University's School of Theatre once he graduated high school in 1999. = College = During his time in college, Blackinton participated in several theatrical productions. He inspired and originated the character of Declan Hennessey in Jason Chimonides' The Optimist, which premiered as a workshop production during FSU's New Horizon Play Festival on June 12, 2004. (Blackinton has gone on to play Hennessey at least two more times‚Äîat a table read in New York in 2005, and again for one week of GroundUP Productions' performance of The Optimist in April 2008.) Other college productions Blackinton was involved in include Leopold and Loeb, a stage adaptation of a 1920s murder case. Blackinton played the role of Loeb, and names a kissing scene he had to do in the show as one of the worst, least believable performances of his acting career. While in college, Blackinton had a minor role in a short educational film entitled Credit Card Monster, in which he played a talk show host discussing the top ten dangers of credit card usage. Perhaps Blackinton's most notable performance in college was when he portrayed the difficult role of Victor Emmanuel Chandebise in the French farce, A Flea in Her Ear. He starred in this production alongside Nicholas Ciavarella who played Dr. Finache.  Joining Cobra Starship  After receiving a BFA in Acting from FSU in 2004, Blackinton moved to Brooklyn, New York in order to pursue work. It was here that he reconnected with Alex Suarez, seven years since the two of them had last spoken. Suarez had graduated from culinary school in Florida, and after his catering company there failed, he had moved to New York for a fresh start. Once they discovered that the two of them lived ten minutes apart from one another, they quickly fell in with one another again, resuming work on the songs they wrote together in high school. As Blackinton and Suarez fleshed out their songs, they named their musical project Ivy League, but later changed it to This Is Ivy League due to copyright issues. Though Blackinton found modest work in New York, he didn't land any major roles, and grew more focused on his musical career. In 2005, pop punk band Midtown broke up, and rumors swirled that frontman Gabe Saporta was starting a new, more pop-oriented musical project. Blackinton and Suarez had both been fans of Midtown, and Midtown drummer Rob Hitt lived in the same apartment building as Suarez. Therefore, they knew about Saporta's new project, and Saporta knew about them. He contacted them early on inviting them to join his new project, but Blackinton and Suarez declined, choosing instead to focus on This Is Ivy League. However, once Blackinton and Suarez learned that Saporta's project, now named Cobra Starship, was set to record the title track for Samuel L. Jackson's Snakes On A Plane, the two of them changed their mind and contacted Saporta asking to join. The band still needed a guitarist and bassist, so he agreed, and the two of them became members. (As both Blackinton and Suarez knew how to play lead and bass guitar, and neither of them had any preference, they flipped a coin to determine who would be the guitarist and who would be the bassist.) Though Saporta had already recorded the majority of Cobra Starship's first album, While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets, by the time Blackinton and Suarez joined, the two of them quickly became invaluable members nonetheless. In addition to playing lead guitar, Blackinton also contributed backing vocals and additional synths to live performances. He also made good usage of his theatrical training in live shows in order to better entertain the audience.  Involvement in Cobra Starship  In the next three Cobra Starship albums, Blackinton and Suarez were very involved in the songwriting process, contributing much of the music while Saporta handled lyrics. Though working with Cobra Starship left him less time for This Is Ivy League, Blackinton continued to work on it alongside Suarez, and they released their debut album in 2008. Beginning with Cobra Starship's 2009 release Hot Mess, Blackinton self-produced Cobra's albums alongside Suarez. Blackinton also began to sing more vocals in live performances at this point, as Saporta had recently undergone vocal chord surgery and lost a bit of his range as a result. Blackinton also produced Cobra's next release, 2011's Night Shades with the help of Suarez. The two of them took the names Pleasure Ryland and Lexual Harassment for production purposes. After the release of Night Shades, Cobra Starship took an unofficial hiatus. Though Blackinton met with Saporta and the rest of the band in the studio on occasion, no announcements or releases were made. During this time, Blackinton also signed to Pulse records as a songwriter and producer.  Post-Cobra Starship  In August 2014, Cobra Starship released Never Been In Love, their first new material in three years. However, two months later, Blackinton and Suarez announced their departure from the band, each of them pursuing their own musical careers. It is unknown how involved Blackinton and Suarez were in the making of Never Been In Love, nor if they were involved in any potential material that Cobra Starship has yet to release. They have since been replaced‚ÄîBlackinton by Andy Barr (formerly touring guitarist for Miranda Cosgrove), Suarez by Eric Halvorsen (formerly of A Rocket To The Moon). Cobra Starship has not released any new material since Blackinton's departure. Since leaving Cobra Starship, Blackinton has moved from New York to Los Angeles. He has produced and written music for several other artists, including Kelly Clarkson and fellow Pulse clients Oliver. He also DJs occasionally, sometimes under the pseudonym of Rothchild.  Guy Ripley  During his time with Cobra Starship (particularly from 2007-2009), Blackinton created and portrayed a character named Guy Ripley. A fictional reporter for BBC World News, Ripley made appearances in related band The Academy Is...'s web series, TAI.TV, in addition to Cobra Starship's own webseries, CobraCam.TV. Ripley was a well- meaning, but ultimately awkward and annoying reporter who often got facts wrong or alienated his guests. Though he targeted all of his subjects equally, Ripley was infatuated with both Cobra Starship keytarist Victoria Asher and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. Guy Ripley's catch-phrase was \\"Delicious.\\" Throughout his appearances, he repeatedly asked his favorite musicians to sign his shoes.  Trivia  A song on Cobra Starship's second album, ¬°Viva La Cobra!, is titled \\"Pleasure Ryland\\". \\"Pleasure Ryland is an imaginary place in your mind that pretty much anybody can go to, where the drinks are free, and you can always dance with most of your clothes off.\\" said Blackinton in an interview. Saporta also said that before Blackinton was a fully paid member of Cobra Starship, he always wore a shirt that said \\"Pleasure Island\\" and decided to name a song \\"Pleasure Ryland\\" But then Saporta said that after they went over the songs on the album, they thought that it was kind of a bad idea that two of their songs had \\"pleasure\\" in them. Blackinton rebuffed him by saying that pleasure is a good thing. Blackinton plays a humorous street musician in the 2008 feature film The Unidentified, directed by Kevan Tucker of Floodgate Features. In that scene, he is seen playing guitar to the song \\"June\\" by This Is Ivy League. Blackinton also co- stars in Misplaced Planet's short zombie video \\"Brains!\\" and contributed the bulk of the music for Misplaced Planet's production of \\"Momentary Engineering,\\" along with Stirling McLaughlin. Blackinton is the second cousin of Westlife singer Shane Filan.

Since that year March 8 has been celebrated as International Women's Day, and the United Nations Decade for Women, from 1976 to 1985, was also established. History After years of work by the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) to adopt a declaration to eliminate discrimination against women, in 1965, CSW began working in earnest to obtain passage of a declaration to secure women's human rights. Collating responses covering education, employment, inheritance, penal reform, and other issues, from government actors, NGO representatives and UN staff, CSW delegates drafted the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (DEDAW), which was passed by the General Assembly on 7 November 1967. Once support had been garnered for the declaration, the next step was to prepare it to become a Convention. Though there were delays, by 1972, when the United States Congress passed Title IX, eliminating discrimination in education for any institution receiving federal funding, hope that passage could be secured surged. In the meantime, members of the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF) had long been pressing for an international women's year and conference to address women's inequality. As WIDF was designated as an observer and not a member of the CSW, they could not propose the event directly but drafted a proposal. Persuading the Romanian delegate of CSW to present their proposal, it was seconded by Finland. In turn, CSW approved the proposal and submitted it to the General Assembly, which proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year on 18 December 1972. The date was significant because it would take place on the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations. But there were problems with the conference. Initially, Soviet women rejected the call for a conference and filibustered the negotiations, preferring to host their own conference in East Berlin that would not be subject to the UN structure. As part of the Cold War politics, the United States then proposed that the conference not be limited to women, but should be gender-neutral, because an all-woman conference would not be taken seriously. Finally, Mexico City agreed to host the conference, and CSW set about the tasks to prepare the \\"machinery\\" necessary to secure passage of CEDAW. Helvi Sipil√§, was selected as the Assistant Secretary-General for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs and placed in charge of organizing events for the year. International =Mexico City= The first UN World Conference on Women was held in Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July. The 1975 conference led to the adoption of the World Plan of Action, as well as the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace. It led to the establishment of monitoring mechanisms such as, International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and set in motion plans for follow-up conferences, the first of which would be held in 1980 in Copenhagen. It established the period of 1975 to 1985 as the UN Decade for Women, to enable progress and failures to be evaluated and resulted in urging that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) be quickly ratified. The 1985 third conference in Nairobi, Kenya, not only closed the decade of women but set a series of member state schedules for removal of legislated gender discrimination in national laws by the year 2000.Allison Dowie, Dangers on the Road to Complete Emancipation, Glasgow Herald, 22 October 1974.Arvonne S.

The 1975 Mexico City Conference was attended by over a thousand delegates. Prominent attendees included Elizabeth Reid and Margaret Whitlam of Australia. The International Women's Year Tribune was also organised and attended by 4,000 women in 1975. =East Berlin= The World Congress of Women was held in East Berlin as a part of IWY soon after the Mexico City event. It idealized women‚Äôs equality as the \\"true embodiment of the socialist conception of human rights\\". The Working Group on Equal Rights, composed of experts on government and law from the East German Academy of Sciences, Humboldt University and Socialist United Party Central Committee rejected the notion that women's rights should fall under a separate area designated by gender, but instead should be governed by the United Nations Human Right's position. Angela Davis was one of the key guests at the conference, as was Hortensia Bussi de Allende, former First Lady of Chile. The state-sponsored program advocated women's solidarity in the national struggles to free women from oppression based on class, race and gender through state socialism. =Brussels= The International Tribunal on the Crimes Against Women was planned as an event for IWY but was not held until 4 to 8 March 1976 in Brussels, Belgium. Limited by funding strictures, the conference hosted 2000 women from forty countries. Speakers addressed economic exploitation and violence against women in its many forms. The most significant development to come out of the conference was the International Feminist Network. Zionism controversy The 1975 conference was also notable for passing the first \\"Zionism is racism\\" resolution passed at any UN- sponsored forum, thus preparing the way for United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 in 1975 the following November.Text of resolution 3379: :TAKING NOTE of the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace 1975, proclaimed by the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July 1975, which promulgated the principle that \\"international co-operation and peace require the achievement of national liberation and independence, the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism, foreign occupation, Zionism, apartheid and racial discrimina as the recognition of the dignity of peoples and their right to self-determination\\".; http://jwa.org/exhibits/jsp/general.jsp?&imgfile;=exhibits%2Fimages%2Fexhban7.gif&media;_id=abamexic A statement equating Zionism with racism was also included in an annex to a report to be considered at the final conference of the United Nations Decade for Women in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya.Sam Roberts, \\"Bernice Tannenbaum, Who Fought U.N. Resolution on Zionism, Dies at 101\\", 9 April 2015. However, as stated in It Takes a Dream: The Story of Hadassah (1997), by Marlin Levin, \\"Bernice asked [President Ronald] Reagan to publicly repudiate the U.N. resolution. He agreed and promised that the U.S. delegation would walk out of Nairobi if the Zionism-equals-racism resolution was included in the final conference declaration.\\" Tannenbaum also convinced the United States Senate to condemn the conference resolution and demand its withdrawal. She also personally flew to Kenya with a draft of the Senate resolution, where Maureen Reagan, President Reagan's daughter and the head of the American delegation, repeated the president‚Äôs promise to withdraw from the conference if the resolution was included in the final conference delegation. Kenya then brokered a compromise in which Zionism was omitted from the final conference report. National =Australia= A conference on 'Women and Politics' was held in September, attended by 700 women. =Canada= The events of IWY in Canada as a whole raised awareness with Canadian women as well as the general public on a wide range of women‚Äôs issues and accomplishments. It spurred the creation of the Ontario Women and the Law Association and the Service, Office and Retail Workers Union of Canada (SORWUC) and offered funding for many to participate in educational and artistic endeavors aimed at presenting women‚Äôs perspectives. One such effort was a petition to the National Film Board of Canada which led to the creation of Studio D. The University of Guelph hosted a conference in September dedicated to Nellie McClung and the reform issues which had been important to her. =New Zealand= In June a United Women's Convention was held in Wellington. =United States of America= Events in support of IWY were held throughout the United States by private organizations and NGOs, such as those held in Connecticut, 11‚Äì12 June 1977 and the Greater Cleveland Congress, October. One of the most significant US events, because it was funded by the US government, was held in Houston, Texas and though planned as an IWY event, did not take place until 1977. The 1977 National Women's Conference included women from each state in the United States and developed a National Plan of Action, mirroring many of the points of the World Plan of Action.  Outcomes  As a result of the international focus on Women in 1975, a number of institutions were established: * International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) * United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) * Women's Studies Resource Centre was established in South Australia during July. Emblem The IWY also launched the \\"dove\\" emblem used by the IWY, CEDAW, and UNIFIL. A stylized dove intersected by a female symbol and an equal sign, the emblem was donated by then 27-year-old New York City advertising company graphic designer Valerie Pettis. It remains the official symbol of UN Women[tools.unifem.org/unifem_logos/UNIFEM-GraphicStandards.pdf Graphic Standards].

The order dual of X is denoted by X+. Along with the related concept of the order bound dual, this space plays an important role in the theory of ordered topological vector spaces.  Canonical ordering  An element f of the order dual of X is called positive if x ‚â• 0 implies Re(f(x)) ‚â• 0. The positive elements of the order dual form a cone that induces an ordering on X+ called the canonical ordering. If X is an ordered vector space whose positive cone C is generating (i.e. X = C - C) then the order dual with the canonical ordering is an ordered vector space. The order dual is the span of the set of positive linear functionals on X.  Properties  The order dual is contained in the order bound dual. If the positive cone of an ordered vector space X is generating and if for all positive x and y we have [0, x] + [0, y] = [0, x + y], then the order dual is equal to the order bound dual, which is an order complete vector lattice under its canonical ordering. The order dual of a vector lattice is an order complete vector lattice. The order dual of a vector lattice X can be finite dimension (possibly even { 0 }) even if X is infinite-dimensional.  Order bidual  Suppose that X is an ordered vector space such that the canonical order on X+ makes X+ into an ordered vector space. Then the order bidual is defined to be the order dual of X+ and is denoted by X++. If the positive cone of an ordered vector space X is generating and if for all positive x and y we have [0, x] + [0, y] = [0, x + y] then X++ is an order complete vector lattice and the evaluation map X ‚Üí X++ is order preserving. In particular, if X is a vector lattice then X++ is an order complete vector lattice.  Minimal vector lattice  If X is a vector lattice and if G is a solid subspace of X+ that separates points in X, then the evaluation map X ‚Üí G+ defined by sending x in X to the map E_x : G^{+} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} given by E_x(f) := f(x), is a lattice isomorphism of X onto a vector sublattice of G+. However, the image of this map is in general not order complete even if X is order complete. Indeed, a regularly ordered, order complete vector lattice need not be mapped by the evaluation map onto a band in the order bidual. An order complete, regularly ordered vector lattice whose canonical image in its order bidual is order complete is called minimal and is said to be of minimal type. = Examples = For any 1 < p < \\\\infty, the Banach lattice L^{p}\\\\left( \\\\mu \\\\right) is order complete and of minimal type; in particular, the norm topology on this space is the finest locally convex topology for which every order convergent filter converges. = Properties = Let X be an order complete vector lattice of minimal type. For any x in X such that x > 0, the following are equivalent: 1. x is a weak order unit. 2. For every non-0 positive linear functional f on X, f(x) > 0. 3. For each topology ùúè on X such that (X, ùúè) is a locally convex vector lattice, x is a quasi-interior point of its positive cone.

It was adopted December 15, 1975,by the United Nations General Assembly by Resolution 31/136. The Decade formally consisted of three international meetings and conferences in Mexico City for \\"consciousness raising\\", Copenhagen for creating \\"networks\\", and Nairobi for \\"the solidarity of women world-wide\\" along with several regional meetings with specific UN agencies (UNESCO, WHO, ECLA, EEC) and nongovernmental organizations (YWCA, World Council of Churches, National Association of Women).  History  The first UN Women's Conference was held in Mexico City in 1975. There it was declared that the UN Decade for Women would began in 1976 due particularly to the efforts of Letitia Shahani and U Thant. Members of the UN, aimed to increase literacy, vocational training, education, and employment opportunities for women. They also planned to improve health education and services, family planning education, and welfare services for women. = Texts = The Conference's Declaration, formally titled the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace, was made to promote the wellbeing of women of all socioeconomic statuses, though there was a particular focus on the protections and outreach to colonized countries. It called for an institution of a New International Economic Order. The Declaration made 30 principles that called for specific measures and areas to focus on for the development of women's rights. Many of these focus on the care for children and family life, access to education and communication, economic independence, rights to political engagement, choice in marriage, sexual autonomy and right to not be assaulted, and more. The inclusion of provisions for the elimination of Zionism was very controversial. In December 1975, the UN's General Assembly committed to the Plan of Action and Declaration. With this, they established a United Nations Voluntary Fund for the Decade on Women (UNIFEM) and the UN International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women. In 1979, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  UN Women's Conferences  = Copenhagen, Denmark, 1980 = This conference was used to reflect on progress made since the 1975 conference in Mexico. As the organization began to reflect upon the progress that had been made so far, some issues that prevented the advancement of women were noted, including: * Lack of sufficient involvement of men in improving women's role in society; * Insufficient political will; * Lack of recognition of the value of women's contributions to society; * Lack of attention to the particular needs of women in planning; * A shortage of women in decision-making positions; * Insufficient services to support the role of women in national life, such as co-operatives, day-care centres and credit facilities; * Overall lack of necessary financial resources; * Lack of awareness among women about the opportunities available to them. Controversially, delegates from a variety of colonized countries elaborated on subjects regarding the domination of the countries they represented by countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. They condemned the international actions and rulings in favor of colonialism, racism, apartheid, hegemonism, and Zionism. When the representatives demanded an elaboration on the texts regarding the opposition and protect of women from the effects of these issues, dozens of the governments of world powers opposed and abstained. In response, a \\"Programme of Action\\" was produced to promote women's ownership and control of property and inheritance, child custody, and loss of nationality. In addition, delegates at the Conference spoke out against stereotyped attitudes towards women. It was adopted with a vote of 94 to 4. The four countries opposed were Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States. The US and Canada criticized the Plan, saying that it went beyond the scope of issues they considered to be pertinent to women, as there was a focus on political disputes. It has since been determined by the UN that countries in conflict are especially harmful to women in the regions. In the end, the conference adopted 45 resolutions on matters on the role of women in development, health, education, employment, and more. The Holy See, of the Catholic Church, was opposed to the texts that included family planning as a human right. = Nairobi, Kenya 1985 = This conference was gathered to celebrate the accomplishments of the decade, but also to establish an agenda that would continue the efforts of the issues facing women beyond 1985. A document titled \\"The Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women\\" was created. In 1995, a conference was held in Beijing, China to accelerate the implementation of the initiatives outlined in the document. In drafting the Forward Looking Strategies document, representatives and supporters of Palestine wanted to add Zionism as a form of oppression to be condemned alongside of neo-colonialism, the arms race, and more. After a three-hour diplomatic lobbying, all parties decided to use the broader terms of \\"racism and racial discrimination\\". At the event, over 160 groups attended the forum of Non-Governmental Organizations and sponsored over 2000 workshops. Women headed 106 of the 160 delegations from as many countries. More than 4000 women came to Kenya during the 2.5 weeks of meetings. Because of this conference, the UN made the UNIFEM an autonomous organization with the UN Development Program.  Legacy  The focus on women during the decade brought about a lot of changes in policies impacting women. A year after the conference in Nairobi, the UN published the first World Survey on the Role of Women in Development. To do the reporting every year, governments had to establish \\"women's departments\\", appoint cabinet ministers for women's affairs, and begin considering the roles and statuses of women in their countries. Prior to these appointments and specific studies, women often went \\"invisible\\" in global economic reports, as their labor is typically unpaid. Many UN programs and funds were created in the duration of the decade that have remained active such as the United Nations Development Fund for Women, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (which 170 countries ratified by 1985), the Commission on the Status of Women, and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women. The UN Economic Council for Africa appointed a women's officer to study the effects of development policies on women.
