It was played at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California on October 1, 2018. The game was won by Los Angeles, 5‚Äì2. The Dodgers became the second seed in the NL playoffs and advanced to play the NL East champion Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series. The Rockies were hosted by the NL Central runner-up Chicago Cubs in the NL Wild Card Game on October 2. The tie-breaker counted as a regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics. Background The Los Angeles Dodgers entered the 2018 Major League Baseball season having won the last five consecutive National League West division championships. The Colorado Rockies made the Major League Baseball postseason in 2017 as a wild card. Despite this being their fifth postseason appearance, the Rockies had not won a division title. Both the Dodgers and Rockies finished the 2018 regular season with win-loss records, necessitating a tie- breaking game to determine the division champion. As the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers tied for first place in the National League Central division, they also played in a tie-breaker game, marking the first time in Major League Baseball that two tie-breakers were needed in a single year. Game summary Cody Bellinger hit a two-run home run for Los Angeles. The Dodgers hosted the tie-breaker game based on their head-to-head record against the Rockies in the regular season. Germ√°n M√°rquez started for Colorado and Walker Buehler started for Los Angeles. ESPN broadcast the game, with Jon Sciambi, David Ross, and Rick Sutcliffe. They also carried the game on ESPN Radio, with Adam Amin and Jim Bowden. The Dodgers got two-run home runs from Cody Bellinger in the fourth inning and Max Muncy in the fifth inning off of M√°rquez, who struck out nine in innings. Meanwhile, Buehler did not allow a hit in his first five innings, and allowed one hit in total innings. The Rockies got solo homers in the ninth inning from Nolan Arenado and Trevor Story off of Kenley Jansen. However, they ended the game with only four hits. The Dodgers won the game 5‚Äì2 to clinch their sixth consecutive division championship. They became the first team to win six straight division championships since the New York Yankees won 13 straight from 1995-2007 and only the third overall (the Atlanta Braves won 14 from 1991-2005). Aftermath With the victory, the Dodgers clinched the second seed in the NL postseason. They beat the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS in four games. The Dodgers defeated the Brewers in the NLCS in seven games, and moved onto the World Series, where they lost in five games to the Boston Red Sox. With the loss, the Rockies were relegated to the second Wild Card spot. The Rockies defeated the Chicago Cubs in the 2018 National League Wild Card Game the next day, but were then swept by the Brewers in the NLDS.

Biography  Amatzia Chen was born in Kibbutz Hulda named Amatzia Haimovich to David and Sima Haimovich, who were among the people that came to resident in Hulda with a group named \\"Bitzur\\" from Romania at the end of the 30s. As a youth, he was trained in patrols around the kibbutz. In high school, he studied agronomics at a professional school in the Jordan Valley, until his enlistment in the IDF on 1959.  Military Service  When he enlisted in the IDF, he volunteered for the Paratroopers Brigade, where he was assigned to the Paratrooper Battalion 890. In the paratroopers Amatzia underwent a training course as a combatant and took part in training and operational activities in the battalion and brigade, later becoming a squad commander. While being in officers course he met a cadet from the Shaked patrol and requested joining them. At the end of the course, he was appointed commander of the platoon in the Shaked brigade until his service ended in 1962. Then he worked in a family business in Beer Sheva, and marketed wholesale of vegetables in Haifa. = Six Day War = In Six Day War he participated in the occupation of the outpost Kuntillet as an officer in Shaked patrol. Following the war, he enlisted in the IDF, and served in Shaked patrol under the command of Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Danny (Volf) Rahav. During this period he participated in raidings across enemy lines in Egypt, Jordan and Syria. = Yom Kippur War = In 1971, the Shaked Patrol was sent to the Gaza Strip, where it was responsible for combatting terrorism. In that time Amatzia was the deputy commander of the patrol, and when Danny Rahav was forced to withdraw from patrol (because of illness), Amatzia commanded the patrol. In 1973 he went to study at the Interdepartmental College for Command and Staff and when the Yom Kippur War broke out, he was ordered to command a special patrol force in Division 143 under the command of Ariel Sharon (who later became the prime minister of Israel), which was named in his name \\"Force Patzi\\", and was referred \\"Roman\\" in the communication network. Under his command, he and his force fought in the Suez Canal, carried out reconnaissance missions and military operations to obtain combat intelligence, and also pursued Egyptian commandos and artillery officers. = After the War = After the war, Amatzia became a member of Armored Corps. From 1976 to 1979 he was the commander of the Reserved Armored Brigade, 434th Brigade (also named \\"The Steel Tracks\\"). Later he commanded the Reserve Division 220 and then the training base at Tze'elim. In the 80s he studied and taught at the National Security College.  Later life  Amatzia graduated from the IDF with the rank of Tat Aluf (Brigadier General) in 1991, and since then he has been working as a road and infrastructure contractor. Amatzia publishes articles on military matters in various journals, with the aim of motivating a change in the IDF. He lives in Karmei Yosef.

It was designed by Queensland Government Architect Alfred Barton Brady and was built in 1898. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  Warwick is situated south west of Brisbane on the Condamine River in the southern Darling Downs, and borders on fertile farmlands and the rolling hills of the Great Dividing Range. It is also strategically located at the junction of major highways from Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The area was first settled by Europeans in 1840, with sheep and wool farming established. The town site was selected in 1847, and was named after Warwick, near Coventry, England. After Brisbane, Warwick was one of the earliest towns in Queensland. The township was proclaimed a municipality in 1861, and the 1860s saw substantial wheat growing in the district, a Cobb and Co. coach service introduced and the expansion of sheep breeding studs. Warwick was connected by the Main Line railway to Ipswich in 1871, and its fertile hinterland became well populated. The town's wide streets were also lined with substantial buildings made from the abundant local sandstone. In 1935 it was proclaimed a City. When the current Warwick Post Office was constructed in 1898, it replaced an earlier post office of 1884. It is not clear whether this earlier post office was on the same site. The new post office incorporated residential quarters at first floor level, and mail and telephone exchange services at ground level. The building was designed by the Queensland Government Architect Alfred Barton Brady possibly with a revision by G D Payne for the first floor. A service wing annexe was added in 1941 and alterations to the post office box lobby occurred in the 1970s or 1980s.  Description  Warwick Post Office is at 98 Palmerin Street, Warwick, comprising the whole of Lot 22 RP147657. Warwick Post Office is located on a prominent corner site to Grafton and Palmerin Street, which is the city's main thoroughfare and shopping precinct. It replaced an earlier post office designed in a quasi- Georgian Colonial manner of 1884. It is not clear whether this earlier post office was on the same site. The new building was developed around the diagonals implied in its corner site, presenting a chamfered entrance lobby and a postal hall formed from two linked oblong spaces and an angled and chamfered linking area, left as a single open space. The postal hall was treated compositionally as an angled space \\"flowing\\" between the more confined areas of the entrance lobby, service rooms and verandah. A deep verandah surrounded the grouping on its street side. On the first floor, the bedrooms and other quarters spaces were grouped around a diagonally angled balcony running back into the bedroom areas, and with two deep, flanking verandahs to either side. Externally these spaces were framed in an envelope of rusticated sandstone, being regularly incised on the first floor and with two bands of broadly spaced, raised stone course rustication on each floor. The ground floor is an arcade with Tuscan pilasters partly enveloped by the triple rustication banding. The corner is trabeated in a fairly delicate set of Doric column forms. The ground floor columns were on a novel and unusually deep base and pedestal combination, probably to keep the Tuscan columns in proportion. Side elevating showing the horseshoe arches on the first level, 2017 The ground floor has a four-arched loggia to each street elevation and the first floor verandah above is screened by a set of elliptical horseshoe arches, probably the only time these appear in a post office building of this period. The arches, each elliptical in the manner of contemporary railway tunnels, are set, compositionally, in a grid that appears to have been pressed back closer against the roof parapet and other parts of the main fa√ßade. Their railings bulge upward in the middle, in an accentuation of Baroque line or the \\"jumping cornice\\" often seen in window framing or clock tower mouldings of this period. Each of the arches has accentuated keystones and their 90 degree side voussoirs also project, resembling the four quadrant-voussoired bullseyes seen on the Ipswich Post Office two years later. The dome drum is an elongated structure, sited well clear of the roof parapet line, and its surface is decorated with a set of eight swags, thus ensuring its prominence when viewed from the street level below. To the corner is the entry pavilion, consisting of paired Tuscan and Ionic columns, with the Ionic pairs surmounted by scroll consoles supporting a ball finial. The original ground floor entry point ‚Äìstill in use today, though modified - is through an angled, rusticated arch. Internally the building provided both mail and telephone exchange services. The exchange was located to the south of the mail room and was initially only at ground floor level. To the first floor were the quarters, accessed from the private entrance and stairs to the northeast corner of the building. These spaces were strung along an L-shaped corridor, which ended at a south-facing window overlooking the roof of the telephone exchange below. At an unknown date, but prior to the major building works of 1941, a stair was constructed within the loggia facing to Palmerin Street. In 1941, a sizeable two-level extension was constructed adjoining the building's east elevation. The addition was as deep again as the original building and doubled the Grafton Street elevation. The building was constructed of rendered brick and roofed with terracotta tile. The 1941 works are further described below under \\"Existing condition and intactness\\". Internally, the ground floor retail space exhibits elements of the original interior scheme as well as the 1941 finishes. There are a pair of polished timber framed glazed entrance doors with a multi-paned transom above, set in to a door frame comprising \\"moderne\\" column clusters. The walls have a dado of polished smooth timber ply and the windows retain their original double hung timber framed sash form to the Grafton Street elevation. The unused doors to the centre of the Palmerin Street elevation have a similar toplight form and the framing of the adjacent windows has been altered to a \\"moderne\\" profile. The original cast iron columns and v-jointed painted timber ceiling is visible within the space and modern suspended pendant lighting has been installed. Air conditioning services have been suspended below the ceiling and are therefore fully visible within the space. Counter forms and merchandising equipment conform to a standard Australia Post suite of finishes. There is an automatic sliding door to the post office box area, contained within the loggia to Grafton Street and extending into the 1941 wing. The archway at the east end wall of the loggia has been infilled with sandstone and the posting boxes in stalled in front. An original archway leads into the post office box area from Grafton Street. The building has two levels, comprising: * Structural frame: cavity walled brick, honed and split-faced sandstone sheathing. Concrete pier footings. Some steel framing for the windows (in the annexe). Timber window framing elsewhere * External walls: cavity walled brick, sandstone sheathing, some timber in the additions * Internal walls: hard plaster over brick, later walling of plaster board, expanded metal lath and plaster to parts of first floor; v-jointed timber lining boards in kitchen * Floor: Sandstone, rendered brick, hardwood boards and skirtings * Ceiling: beaded pine boarding, fibro cement, finished concrete * Roof: corrugated galvanised iron; terracotta tile to the annexe The 1941 works involved expanding the mail room to the ground floor, the abolition of the first floor quarters and the expansion of the telephone exchange. The ground floor exchange room received an additional level, and the first floor chimneys, servicing the quarters were removed, and the corridor abolished and the rooms partitioned and altered variously to their new use. The quarters entrance and stair from Grafton Street were also abolished and a new service stair ‚Äì in addition to the external stair in the loggia ‚Äì was constructed on the site of the former rear verandah, which was sited at the junction of the two wings. The ground floor public areas were also altered with the former ground floor telephone exchange space absorbed into the public area and mail room space, allowing an expansion of both. The entrance doors were relocated into a new vestibule space which led to the expanded public space along the Grafton Street frontage and new doors ‚Äì still extant but not used ‚Äì were installed into a former window opening to the Grafton Street loggia. The vestibule works have subsequently been reversed. The east wall was opened out at the ground floor to allow for an expanded mail room and improved staff amenities, and the first floor provided space for equipment and a battery room. This was followed by a series of internal fitouts through the whole complex, culminating in the conversion of the public area to the standard Australia Post retail format in the 1990s. The mail boxes have been relocated away from their original location on the ground floor verandah.  Heritage listing  Post Office, newly built Warwick Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Warwick Post Office, constructed in 1898, is located on a prominent corner site within a centre renowned for its substantial buildings made from the abundant local sandstone. Its scale and architectural treatment reflect Warwick's prosperity and development in the nineteenth century. Criterion B: Rarity Warwick Post Office is distinct among public buildings in Queensland, and possibly more broadly, in that it adopts a \\"contemporary\\" Baroque Revival usage at the end of the nineteenth century, as opposed to earlier Baroque treatments of the 1860s-80s. Although it draws together a series of notable British precedents, it does so in a quite original combination. This is accentuated by the use of horseshoe arches on the first floor, seen more commonly in less formal buildings of this period. The post office's use of a hollowed out \\"envelope\\" in its external sun protection is also a creative development of JJ Clark's use of it on the Old Brisbane Treasury. Criterion D: Characteristic values Warwick Post Office is an example of: * a post and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * the Baroque Revival grand Manner in the 1900s fashion, with some Federation elements * a large annexe building in a 1940s early Modern-Scandinavian Classicist manner * the work Queensland Government Architect Andrew BartonBrady, possibly assisted by G D Payne Typologically, the Warwick Post Office originally incorporated residential quarters at first floor level, and mail and telephone exchange services at ground level. Subsequent works, including the 1941 program, expanded the telephone exchange (received an additional level) and mail room to the ground floor, and removed the first floor quarters function including the corridor, partitioning rooms, and removing the quarters entrance and stair from Grafton Street. The ground floor public areas were also altered with the former ground floor telephone exchange space absorbed into the public area and mail room space. The entrance doors were additionally relocated into a new vestibule space which led to the expanded public space along the Grafton Street frontage. These works, and others, have served to impact on the original internal planning and typological attributes of the building. Stylistically and architecturally, however, Warwick Post Office, designed by Queensland Government Architect AB Brady, and possibly also G D Payne, is distinct among public buildings in Queensland in adopting a \\"contemporary\\" Baroque Revival approach in the late nineteenth century. This is accentuated by the use of horseshoe arches on the first floor; the post office's use of a hollowed out \\"envelope\\" in its external sun protection is also a creative development. The building is additionally enhanced by its rusticated sandstone treatment and prominent corner siting, the elongated decorated dome drum over the (chamfered) corner entrance pavilion, and the arcaded verandahs (loggias) with distinctive elliptical horseshoe arches. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Warwick Post Office has a high level of aesthetic significance deriving from its rusticated sandstone treatment and prominent corner siting, emphasised by the elongated decorated dome drum over the (chamfered) corner entrance pavilion, and the arcaded verandahs (loggias) with distinctive elliptical horseshoe arches. Criterion F: Technical achievement Warwick Post Office demonstrates a high degree of creative achievement in its successful late nineteenth century application of the Baroque Revival style in an original combination. The rusticated sandstone treatment is of merit, as is the skilful and elegant application of Tuscan and Ionic columns and pilasters, scroll consoles, swag decoration, and the accentuated keystones and side voussoirs to the elliptical horseshoe arches. Criterion G: Social value Warwick Post Office is a locally- valued public building dating back to the late 1890 and also one of Warwick's important collection of sandstone buildings.

He committed suicide in 2005.  Biography  Steven McWilliams was a \\"former cowboy\\" who attended Western State Colorado University and the University of Colorado. In 1992, McWilliams was in a motorcycle accident and sustained a head injury, and afterwards suffered from chronic pain and migraines, which he said he found relief from with medical marijuana.  Medical marijuana activism  After California passed Proposition 215 in 1996, which allowed certain patients to be recommended cannabis by a doctor, McWilliams opened multiple medical marijuana collectives in San Diego to provide cannabis for patients, including Shelter from the Storm and Valley Center Cannabis Club. In January 1998, Valley Center Cannabis Club was raided and McWilliams was arrested for possession. That March he was arraigned for growing, selling, and transporting cannabis, which led to the first widely publicized case about the enforcement and limits of Proposition 215. The District Attorney declined to press charges due to lack of information. In 2002, McWilliams protested obstruction of Proposition 215 by standing in front of San Diego City Hall by smoking and handing out cannabis to patients. He also showed up weekly to Town Council meetings, sometimes carrying a live marijuana plant, to convince the local government to make clear local regulations regarding medical marijuana in San Diego. McWilliams was arrested in 2002 by federal law enforcement for growing about two dozen cannabis plants at his home in Normal Heights. In early 2003, United States District Judge James Fitzgerald sentenced him to six months in federal prison. He was not allowed to use cannabis as part of his bail terms. There was speculation McWilliams was targeted with a harsh sentence due to his activism. Not long after, the Supreme Court ruled that federal cannabis laws superseded local laws, which meant McWilliams' appeal would be denied and he would go to prison. On July 12, 2005 on his 51st birthday, McWilliams committed suicide by overdosing on methadone, an opioid he'd been prescribed for pain. In his suicide note, he said that he was in pain and hoped his death might convince the government to respect people's right to cannabis. He also called out Reuben Brooks, the federal judge who had ruled he could not use medical marijuana while out on bail.

Construction The puzzle consists of a set of disks of different sizes, placed in increasing order of size on a fixed set of towers. The Hanoi graph for a puzzle with n disks on k towers is denoted H^n_k. Each state of the puzzle is determined by the choice of one tower for each disk, so the graph has k^n vertices. In the moves of the puzzle, the smallest disk on one tower is moved either to an unoccupied tower or to a tower whose smallest disk is larger. If there are u unoccupied towers, the number of allowable moves is :\\\\binom{k}{2}-\\\\binom{u}{2}, which ranges from a maximum of \\\\tbinom{k}{2} (when u is zero or one and \\\\tbinom{u}{2} is zero) to k-1 (when all disks are on one tower and u is k-1). Therefore, the degrees of the vertices in the Hanoi graph range from a maximum of \\\\tbinom{k}{2} to a minimum of k-1. The total number of edges is :\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\binom{k}{2}\\\\bigl(k^n-(k-2)^n\\\\bigr). For k=0 (no disks) there is only one state of the puzzle and one vertex of the graph. For k > 0, the Hanoi graph H^n_k can be decomposed into k copies of the smaller Hanoi graph H^{n-1}_k, one for each placement of the largest disk. These copies are connected to each other only at states where the largest disk is free to move: it is the only disk in its tower, and some other tower is unoccupied. General properties Every Hanoi graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle. The Hanoi graph H^1_k is a complete graph on k vertices. Because they contain complete graphs, all larger Hanoi graphs H^n_k require at least k colors in any graph coloring. They may be colored with exactly k colors by summing the indexes of the towers containing each disk, and using the sum modulo k as the color. Three towers A particular case of the Hanoi graphs that has been well studied since the work of is the case of the three-tower Hanoi graphs, H^n_3. These graphs have vertices. They are penny graphs (the contact graphs of non-overlapping unit disks in the plane), with an arrangement of disks that resembles the Sierpinski triangle. One way of constructing this arrangement is to arrange the numbers of Pascal's triangle on the points of a hexagonal lattice, with unit spacing, and place a unit disk on each point whose number is odd. The diameter of these graphs, and the length of the solution to the standard form of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle (in which the disks all start on one tower and must all move to one other tower) is 2^{n}-1. More than three towers For k > 3, the structure of the Hanoi graphs is not as well understood, and the diameter of these graphs is unknown. When k > 4 and n > 0 or when k = 4 and n > 2, these graphs are nonplanar.

The genus lived during the Middle Miocene epoch (Laventan in the SALMA classification). The genus contains two described species, the type species M. anomopodus described in 1953 by Ruben Arthur Stirton and M. federicoi, described and included in the genus by Darin A. Croft. Fossils of Miocochilius have been found at the Lagerst√§tte of La Venta in the Honda Group of Colombia, where it is the most abundant mammal, the Honda Group of Bolivia (M. federicoi) and the Ipururo Formation in the Ucayali Basin of Peru. The typothere lived alongside a rich faunal assemblage comprising many other mammals, crocodylians, turtles and lizards.  Description  Manus and pes of Miocochilius The genus Miocochilius was first described by Ruben Arthur Stirton in 1953, based on a nearly complete and numerous incomplete skeletons found in the Honda Group of Colombia.Miocochilius at Fossilworks.orgStirton, 1953, p.265 The type species was named M. anomopodus. More fossils of this species were found at La Venta and in the Ipururo Formation in Peru.Miocochilius anomopodus at Fossilworks.org The holotype specimen of the small typothere, a cursorial insectivore, had a cerebral hemisphere length of , canines of and a cheekbone of . The premaxilla measured . A second species, M. federicoi, was described by Darin A. Croft in 2007 based on a maxilla found in the Honda Group of Bolivia.Miocochilius federicoi at Fossilworks.org The species epithet refers to Federico Anaya, a scientist and field collector who has been instrumental in advancing vertebrate paleontology in Bolivia. M. federicoi differs from Eopachyrucos, Santiagorothia, Proargyrohyrax, Archaeophylus and Progaleopithecus in having extremely high crowned teeth. The described species is differentiated from the Chasicoan to Colloncuran genus Protypotherium in having more open lingual enamel folds, variable presence of small median lobe on upper molars, and molars with more rounded distal lobes. The species also is different than Plagiarthrus in the absence of fossettes on the upper molars. Compared to Cochilius and the Colloncuran Interatherium, Miocochilius federicoi has a longer, low skull. The author inclined to describe the specimen as a separate genus, but finally included the species in Miocochilius.Croft, 2007, p.284  Paleoecology  Miocochilius shared its habitat with many other mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians.

It was designed by John Smith Murdoch of the Queensland Government Architect's office and was built by D. Stewart and Co in 1901. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  The Stanthorpe Post Office was completed in 1901, making it the first post-Federation post office to be built in Queensland, and possibly Australia. The new post and telegraph office replaced an earlier postal building which had been constructed in 1885. The plans for the new building were completed by the Queensland Government Architect's office, under the direction of Alfred Barton Brady, in October 1900. The building underwent alterations in 1963 when a northern wing was added.Register of the National Estate The site, at the northwest corner of Maryland and Railway streets, was previously occupied by the earlier timber post and telegraph office of 1884, which was moved to the rear of the site when the present building was constructed. The postmaster's residential quarters are assumed to have been separate. The design of the building has been attributed to John Smith Murdoch, with the Stanthorpe Post Office being his last design in southern Queensland before he was sent to the northern public works district.Watson and McKay (1994, p. 129) Murdoch would soon become the first design architect for the Australian Government. It was built by D. Stewart and Co in 1901. The clock came from England and was installed in 1903.Plaque on the Stanthorpe Post Office The post office underwent alterations in 1963 creating enlarged service delivery areas, amenities and a post office box lobby and the relocation of the post office post shops. The work involved the over-painting of stucco, removal of original chimneys to north and south sides of the building, illuminated signage, over-painting of upper portion of central fanlight window to fa√ßade; automatic sliding aluminium entrance door, concrete steps and retiled floor to entry porch, ramp to north porch, postal box enclosure to fa√ßade annexed from the original postal hall.  Description  Stanthorpe Post Office is at 14 Maryland Street, corner Railway Street, Stanthorpe. It was built in 1901 in an informal Arts and Crafts style mixed with Edwardian Baroque Revival elements.English Renaissance or English Baroque revival of c.1885-1914 The original building was one storey in height with a four-storey tower, consisting of: * Structural frame: cavity brick. The base is rock faced coursed locally sourced granite and tuckpointed red brick with concrete piers. * External walls: Brick with extensive cladding in textured stucco. * Internal walls: Altered around 1963 with windows to north wall infilled. * Floor: Timber framed * Ceiling: beaded timber lining boards to porch soffits, v-jointed tongue and groove boarded trussed ceiling. * Roof: half hipped form, of uncorrugated metal sheet with crimped joint coverings, beaded timber lining boards, pyramidal vented cupola. * Flagpole with lightning conductor * Rendered sills The site has an extensive and largely unpaved yard area accommodating a car park, warehouse-depot for mail deliveries and a telecommunications tower. Royal coat of arms, 2015 The Maryland Street front is a basically symmetrical composition, but is confounded by the placement of a tall clock tower on the corner. The tower is formally linked to the postal hall elevation by a parapet-entablature line that extends an otherwise symmetrical parapet behind the main post hall breakfront. The Post Office has two prominent entrances, through arched corner porches to either side of the post hall wall and main window. This is treated as a breakfront and quasi-pediment, moulded at the top in a red brick cornice, and broken at its base line by a royal coat of arms and the keystone and upper arch of the central window. The window itself has a tympanum inside the arch and a multiple-paned main light, and is flanked by two tall rectangular windows with squared tympani above each light. The whole forms a Serlian group, framed and bisected by plain brick piers and two recessed piers below the main arch springing point, with brick mouldings suggesting a Tuscan order. The frieze below the pediment, matched by a frieze at the neighbouring tower base, is a combination of exposed brickwork and rough textured stucco, of a type soon seen in many Arts and Crafts houses in the capital cities from the 1900s on. These materials are combined again in the parapet behind the pediment and the tower base, and in spandrels over the entry arches. On the Railway Street side the stuccoed frieze is punctuated by a series of diagonally angled struts supporting a broad eave, and a stretch of metal-clad roof in a catslide descending from a hipped gable between two stub-parapets. This theme is repeated on the north-east end of the Maryland Street elevation, where an exposed hipped gable flanks one side of the main breakfront. Both these elements recur in later Queensland Post Office designs such as Wooloongabba Post Office (1904) and Mount Morgan Post Office (1910) (in the masonry designs) and Cooroy Post Office of 1912-13 (in the timber series). The clock tower is a plain stuccoed shaft, recalled in TR Hall's Sandgate Town Hall of 1911. The name is lettered 1/3 the way up the shaft. Tall vent windows topped with brick balconettes and corner piers capped with rounded red-brick frame a narrower oblong mass housing the clocks, which terminated with a brick cornice and a recessed arcade below a low-pitched pyramidal roof and louvred vents. To the north there is a single level 1963 brown brick service wing addition, subsequently further extended during the late 1980s. It comprises mail delivery work areas, sorting spaces and additional post office box accommodation to Maryland Street. The west elevation of the original building comprises a timber-framed and weatherboard-clad addition, infilling what is thought to have been a previously open verandah flanked by brick lavatories. The brick enclosure to the south west has been extended by several courses of brickwork at an unknown date, and a small window removed and patched. The original paired doors to the original outer wall and one of the flanking windows removed. This is thought to have been a staggered addition, as the window forms differ and the weatherboards are not aligned and separated by a joint line. Internally the original post shop to the east fa√ßade has been converted to form the post office box lobby, running north south behind the fa√ßade ‚Äì with timber and glazed doors to the original entrances to either end, with arched glazed toplights. The original ceiling is concealed by a suspended grid-form acoustic tile ceiling and there is a fluorescent fitting mounted to its surface. The west wall of this lobby contains many of the post office boxes set into a non-original wall with aluminium framed glazing above. Disabled access to the post shop is via the ramp to the northern porch and through the post office box lobby and into the entry porch at the street corner below the tower. This entry porch is of tuckpointed brick and there are non-original doors to the west ‚Äì access to the retail area, fitted with an automatic sliding aluminium door with squared off infill to arched original opening above ‚Äì and to the north ‚Äì access to the post office box lobby, fitted with a timber panel door with glazed upper pane. These doors flank the curved brick corner wall and its inset painted timber panel door which leads to the tower. The tower is accessed via a timber stair with winders and an open timber balustrade. The tower walls are of over-painted brick. The clock mechanism appears to be intact. War memorial plaque, 2019 Within the building, the post shop now comprises the southern portion of the original post office space, and is divided from the working areas by a three-quarter height plasterboard partition. Originally the service counter was located beneath a large brick archway to the west facing into what is now the post office box lobby. The upper portion of this archway has been squared off, and partially infilled with plasterboard. The ceiling to this space is of v-jointed tongue- and-groove timber lining boards. The decorative timber trusses are exposed and there are decorative metal vents to the ceiling space above. The whole has been over-painted. The light fittings are \\"reproduction\\" style brass-finish type, fitted with milk-glass shades and are suspended from the trusses. The postal hall roof was restored in the late 1990s and the introduced air conditioning ducting and services are suspended below the ceiling. The walls are of over-painted brick and there is also timber picture rail. The floor is variously of carpet to the public area and of vinyl tile to the back of house spaces. The fitout to the public area is of standard Australia Post design with the counters diagonally placed in relation to the entry. Originally there were fireplaces to either side of the main space, but these have both been removed. The catalyst for this may have been the construction of the north extension ‚Äì the breaking through of the north wall would have required the removal of the north fireplace and chimney. Windows to the now internalised north wall have been bricked up. Information plaque, 2015 Within this space there is also an interview room enclosed by three-quarter height aluminium framed glazed partitions to the northwest corner. To the west, the original paired doors have been removed but the multipaned fanlight above has been retained, but over-painted. This now opens to a lunch room, male toilet facilities and stores. The storage areas to the southwest corner of the building ‚Äì previously thought to have been a lavatory, constructed of brick ‚Äì has a suspended ceiling form, as described previously. The lunch room is externally clad in weatherboards, and the interior walls are lined with fibrocement sheeting. The now enclosed west wall is of over-painted brick. The 1963 and later extension exhibits typical finishes and plan form of the era ‚Äì the floors are of vinyl tile over concrete, walls of plasterboard and the ceilings are lined in plaster sheeting. The building has a World War I memorial plaque and a modern plaque with brief information about the building. = Condition = As at 2008, the external intactness and integrity of the building was good. Internally, the spaces have been refurbished, but the interiors retain original fabric in terms of floors, walls, ceilings and joinery, etc, albeit overpainted.  Heritage listing  The significant components of Stanthorpe Post Office include the main postal building of 1901. The northern wing, added in 1963 and extended in the late 1980s, weatherboard infill to the west elevation and the loading dock are not significant for the purpose of the heritage listing. Stanthorpe Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The Stanthorpe Post Office is significant as the first post office in Queensland, and possibly Australia, to be built after the federation of the Australian colonies in January 1901. Designed in 1900 and completed in 1901 by Thomas Pye of the Queensland Public Works Office, it represents one of the many early contributions of the Queensland government to the fledgling Commonwealth. It follows an Australia- wide practice, in the sphere of communications, of state governments constructing postal and telegraph offices on behalf of the Commonwealth Postmaster General's Office, which was formally established in 1902. The Commonwealth did not have the resources, except in NSW and Victoria, to construct its own postal offices until the early 1920s. In terms of the local community, the Stanthorpe Post Office is also significant as a prominent public building and, as with most country areas, one of the first and most prominent manifestations of Commonwealth government presence in the town. Criterion D: Characteristic values Stanthorpe Post Office is an example of: * a post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) with a clock tower is also present * an informal Arts and Crafts treatment mixed with Edwardian Baroque Revival elements. * the work of the Queensland Government Architect's Office attributed to JS Murdoch. Typologically, Stanthorpe has a high measure of integrity to its original design, particularly external integrity. Stylistically and architecturally, Stanthorpe forms an important group, coming just after Ipswich Post Office and before Mount Morgan Post Office in its application of Baroque Revival form and detailing to a post office. It is among the earliest Australian public buildings to be completed in a turn of the century Baroque manner, and, with Ipswich, counts as a prototype for the dominant mode in Australian public architecture till c.1918. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics The building, in the Informal Arts and Crafts style with an elaborate Royal coat of arms and a prominent four-storey clock tower, has a strong aesthetic impact on the Stanthorpe streetscape.

Biography Ruslan Gorovyi was born on 1 March 1976 in the town of Konotop of Sumy region. The oldest child, he has a brother and a sister. Konotop ‚Äì the land of legends is a book he devoted to his hometown (publishing house ‚ÄúTaTySho‚Äù, 2018). After graduating from High School Number 3, he entered Konotop Electrical Engineering College. After the collapse of the USSR, there were few local opportunities and his outlook was extremely bleak. So, dropping out of his third year of studies, Ruslan set off on a journey to Europe (partly described in the story Ninetieth Wave of Migration). He returned after five years of being abroad, studied, went in for TV journalism, wrote poems, songs and prose. Now he lives in Kyiv. He has two children from his first wife. His second daughter, Daryna, was born on 12 September 2017 to his current wife.  Journalism and social activism  After returning from abroad Ruslan started working in journalism, for KST (Konotop) TV production company. Then Ruslan worked for the Eastern Project (Kramatorsk) newspaper, and the Alternative media group (Kyiv). Since 1998 he worked at Magnoliya-TV and became Executive Director of the ChP.INFO (–ß–ü.—ñ–Ω—Ñ–æ) channel. In 2001 Ruslan Gorovyi began developing his project ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Search Service‚Äù, with the goal of helping to find missing kids: making the videos and printed materials about them, informing the public, collecting and processing information (‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Search Service‚Äù reception and telephone hotline), helping lost children to return home. In 2006 he graduated with honours from the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts for cinema and television specializing in directing films and television. Among the honours for his work, Ruslan Volodymyrovych has received the Order of St. Michael Archistrategos from Patriarch Filaret (Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate) and the honorary title of the Merited Journalist of Ukraine from the President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko. Since the time of EuroMaidan he has been an active volunteer, participating activities of the Charitable Foundation Free UA (Work in Eastern Ukraine), as well as helping the children of Ladyzhin and Medzhybizh orphanages. =Films= * 2013 - Kyiv Flood. The tape is devoted to the Kurenivka mudslide * 2015 ‚Äì Ukrops of Donbas. On April 11, 2015, the TV channel ChP.INFO (–ß–ü.–Ü–ù–§–û) showed the premiere of this documentary film by Ruslan Gorovyi. Ukrops is based on a story of Luhansk resident loyal to the Ukrainian state, tortured for that reason by Russian occupants in 2014 during the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Since late 2015 at the initiative of public figures, activists, diaspora communities and diplomats, screening of this film was held in different countries and even at the UN headquarters. * 2017 ‚Äì Refugee Literature Ruslan Vladymyrovych's creativity is characterized by a sober, humanistic view of the events of modern history and modern times. Prose works are filled with warm everyday stories about ordinary or unique people, which can be easily found on the street, or when traveling by train; sources of creativity are often the memories of the elderly, urban legends, his own rich life experience. One of the sources of inspiration is his work: in numerous stories he reveals the problems of social injustice, economic (often criminal) processes of the formation of capitalism, the spiritual crisis associated with the collapse of the Soviet identity and the formation of Ukrainian self-consciousness. His works are characterized by acute social themes, enthusiastic knockdown plots, psychology. A number of works return readers to the Chornobyl tragedy, as one of the decisive events in the recent history of Ukraine.

It also served as the main civil airport of Nanchang from 1957 until 1999, when all commercial flights were transferred to the new Nanchang Changbei International Airport. Location and facilities Nanchang Xiangtang Airport is located in the town of Xiangtang, south of central Nanchang and west of Xiangtang railway station. It occupies an area of , and has a paved runway measuring by .  History  Xiangtang Air Base was built in 1952 by the People's Liberation Army Air Force. In August 1956, the Chinese government decided to convert the airbase into a dual-use military and civil airport. On 1 January 1957, Nanchang's first civil flight in the People's Republic of China era took off at Xiangtang, bound for Ganzhou. In Xiangtang's first full year of operation, it served a total of 102 passengers, which increased to 35,709 in 1980. From March 1981 to early 1982, Xiangtang Airport's runway was strengthened and thickened, and Qingyunpu Airport temporarily served as Nanchang's main airport for nine months. During the reform and opening era, air travel boomed and Xiangtang's passenger volume grew rapidly. It handled more than 100,000 passengers in 1989, and more than 800,000 in both 1995 and 1996. Although expanded twice, Xiangtang Airport was unable to accommodate the explosive growth in traffic. In 1996, construction began for the Nanchang Changbei Airport to replace Xiangtang. When Changbei Airport was opened on 10 September 1999, all commercial flights were transferred to the new airport and Xiangtang reverted to sole military use. The airport currently hosts the 40th Air Brigade, equipped with approximately 70 J-16 fighters.

Rather, he proposes a ‚Äòdiachronic‚Äô conception of natural law as evolving over time.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, 246. Crowe describes natural law as ‚Äòsocially embodied, historically extended and dependent on facts about human nature.‚ÄôCrowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, 6. Natural law, on this view, is shaped by both inherent human qualities and the natural and social environments of human communities.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, 6-7. It reflects ‚Äòthe ongoing human quest to work out how best to live flourishing, fulfilling lives given the nature we have and the social worlds we inhabit.‚ÄôJonathan Crowe, ‚ÄòNatural Law and the Nature of Law in a Nutshell' (2019) 44 Australasian Journal of Legal Philosophy 100, 101. = Artifact theory of law = Crowe defends a theory of the nature of law that focuses on law‚Äôs character as a human artifact.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, ch 8-9. He argues that artifacts are defined primarily by reference to their functions.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, 161. Law‚Äôs function is ‚Äòto serve as a deontic marker by creating a sense of social obligation‚Äô.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, 175. Crowe contends that a law that is poorly suited to perform this function is defective, while a purported legal enactment that is incapable of performing this function fails to qualify as law.Crowe, ‚ÄòNatural Law and the Nature of Law in a Nutshell‚Äô, 103. A law that is so unjust that it is incapable of creating a sense of social obligation will therefore be no law at all.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, 176-7. = Judicial interpretation = Crowe‚Äôs work on judicial interpretation is critical of originalism. He argues that judges should give legal documents their ordinary contemporary meaning, rather than the meaning they held when first enacted.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, ch 11. This is necessary to preserve law‚Äôs function as a means of social coordination.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, 208. Crowe argues that judges should interpret laws in light of social practices and institutions, relying on ‚Äòhistorically extended narratives‚Äô.Jonathan Crowe, ‚ÄòThe Narrative Model of Constitutional Implications: A Defence of Roach v Electoral Commissioner‚Äô (2019) 42 University of New South Wales Law Journal 91; Jonathan Crowe, ‚ÄòNot-So-Easy Cases‚Äô (2019) 40 Statute Law Review 75.

He further contends that, where the law is unjust, judges should bring it into dialogue with moral values to reach a practically reasonable outcome.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, ch 12. = Political philosophy = Crowe challenges the traditional focus of natural law theory on state institutions.Crowe, Natural Law and the Nature of Law, ch 6. He highlights the important role of non-state forms of order, such as evolved social norms and practices, in securing the common good.Jonathan Crowe, ‚ÄòNatural Law and the Nature of Law: A Response to Commentators‚Äô (2019) 44 Australasian Journal of Legal Philosophy 133, 138-41; Jonathan Crowe, ‚ÄòNatural Law Anarchism‚Äô (2014) 7 Studies in Emergent Order 288. Crowe argues that justice is best understood as the outcome of ethical relations between embodied persons, rather than as a set of idealised institutions imposed on society from above. He describes this idea as ‚Äòsmall justice‚Äô. Jonathan Crowe, ‚ÄòSmall Justice: The Rights of the Other Animal‚Äô in Peter Atterton and Tamra Wright (eds), Face-to-Face with Animals: Levinas and the Animal Question (State University of New York Press, 2019); Jonathan Crowe, ‚ÄòThe Idea of Small Justice‚Äô, Julius Stone Institute Seminar Series (University of Sydney, 27 June 2019). He criticises competing theories of justice, such as that of John Rawls, for neglecting the role of interpersonal interactions in ensuring justice at a societal level.Crowe, ‚ÄòThe Idea of Small Justice‚Äô. = Existentialism = Crowe‚Äôs work on legal and ethical theory is influenced by existentialism, particularly the writings of Emmanuel Levinas. His doctoral thesis examined the intersections between existentialist ethics and natural law theory.Jonathan Crowe, Existentialism, Liberty and the Ethical Foundations of Law (PhD Thesis, University of Queensland, 2006). Crowe draws attention to the important role of time in Levinas‚Äôs writings. He argues that the temporal (or diachronic) dimension of Levinas‚Äôs theory bridges the gap between his ethics and his political philosophy.Jonathan Crowe, ‚ÄòLevinas on Shared Ethical Judgments‚Äô (2011) 42(3) Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology 233; Jonathan Crowe, ‚ÄòLevinasian Ethics and the Concept of Law‚Äô in Desmond Manderson (ed.), Essays on Levinas and Law: A Mosaic (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009). = Mediation ethics = In collaborative work with Rachael Field, Crowe has argued for a new understanding of the ethics of mediation.Rachael Field and Jonathan Crowe, Mediation Ethics: From Theory to Practice (Edward Elgar, 2020). Traditional views of mediation ethics focus on mediator neutrality or impartiality. However, Field and Crowe contend these notions are unhelpful and unrealistic when applied to mediation practice.Field and Crowe, Mediation Ethics, ch 5-6. Instead, they propose a new ethical paradigm centred on party self-determination.Field and Crowe, Mediation Ethics, ch 9. This approach is supported by ‚Äòa focus on informed consent and an ethos of professionalism‚Äô.Field and Crowe, Mediation Ethics, 6. Field and Crowe defend a contextual ethical method as the most suitable way of resolving ethical dilemmas in mediation practice.Field and Crowe, Mediation Ethics, ch 10.

At one time a hospital for infectious diseases, it later became a site used by several health-related organisations.  History  Westhulme Hospital was one of several isolation hospitals established in Lancashire during the 1870s as a response to smallpox epidemics prevalent in the region at that time. Opening in 1878, it was larger and more suited to treating a range of infectious diseases than some other examples, such as those at Blackpool and Blackburn. It initially comprised three eight- bed wards and three single-bed rooms in wooden buildings. Scarlet fever cases were a substantial proportion of its early intake and in 1880, coinciding with the introduction of local legislation making notification of infectious diseases compulsory, it was decided to create more permanent structures. The new buildings attracted 13,000 people visiting as viewers. Following initial suspicions concerning its function, the hospital catered for patients from a wide demographic, including mothers with children, tradespeople and paupers. A substantial portion of its area was subsumed in the 1980s when the Chadderton Way road was built and the hospital itself closed in around 1990. In 2006, the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust announced that it was to sell the site, which at that time housed its offices, to alleviate a ¬£28m debt crisis. The 284 staff on the site were to be redeployed among the Trust's other hospital sites. In 2012, after 135 years, it was reported that outline planning permission was in place for development of the remainder for housing purposes, although one potential alternative was for it to be used for car park facilities serving the Royal Oldham Hospital. The site was subsequently developed as an Audi car dealership for Jardine Motors Group, which opened in 2017.  Notable people  Notable people associated with the hospital included James Niven who was superintendent there in the 1880s.

It took part in the costly battles around the German salient near Rzhev through 1942 and into 1943. Following this it served in the summer offensive towards Smolensk, also at considerable cost, but it won a battle honor for its role in the liberation of Yartsevo. After a brief rebuilding in the reserves, the division was moved south to the 1st Ukrainian Front, taking part in the liberation of Ukraine through 1944. Following the Vistula-Oder Offensive, the 359th gathered high honors during the fighting around Breslau in 1945, but along with many other distinguished Soviet formations it was disbanded with the coming of peace.

Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 At its formation, the basic order of battle was as follows: * 1194th Rifle Regiment * 1196th Rifle Regiment * 1198th Rifle Regiment * 924th Artillery Regiment * 641st (later 443rd) Sapper Battalion * 812th Signal Battalion (later 218th Signal Company) * 423rd Reconnaissance Companyhttps://schoolmuseum623.jimdo.com/%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B8/ (in Russian).

Aleksandr Mikhailovich Filippov on September 1. However, he was replaced on October 3 by Col. Zalman Ionovich Khotimsky. The unit began moving west in November and was first assigned to 28th Army which was forming up in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. It went to the front in December as a separate division, joining Kalinin Front before being assigned to 31st Army. It was noted at that time as being at full strength for personnel, with 10,000 officers and men assigned.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 93 In February 1942, the 359th was reassigned to the 30th Army, in the same general area north - northwest of Rzhev. On February 28, Colonel Khotimsky was replaced in command by Maj. Gen. Vladimir Romanovich Vashkevich, the only general officer who would command the division. In August it moved with 30th Army to Western Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 93 =Operation Mars= At the end of September General Vashkevich was appointed as chief of staff of 20th Army, while officially remaining in command of the division. On November 20 he was replaced by Col. Vasily Kuzmich Guryashin. In the first days of December it was becoming clear that the Second Rzhev-Sychyovka Strategic Offensive (a.k.a. Operation Mars) was looking like it would be a costly failure. In an effort to salvage something from the ruins, Army General G. K. Zhukov issued revised orders to attempt to encircle and destroy at least part of the German forces. 39th Army had had some success in the Molodoi Tud area in the early going. The new plan was to renew the attack from this area, with supporting, or diversionary, attacks by 30th Army's 359th and 380th Rifle Divisions. The attack went in on December 3, after a brief but violent artillery preparation. The German forward defenses were penetrated, and more artillery was brought into the bridgehead on the south bank of the Volga. But by evening, the division's attack on the 251st Infantry Division's right flank was contained.David M. Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp. 218-20 Advance On August 13, 1943, Colonel Guryashin handed his command to Col. Pyotr Pavlovich Kosolapov, who would remain in this post for the duration of the war. By September, as Western Front advanced towards Smolensk, the division was in the 36th Rifle Corps of 31st Army. On September 19 it was awarded a divisional honorific: Following the liberation of Smolensk, Western Front continued its offensive towards Orsha. The first attempt to take this city began on the morning of October 3. Lt. Gen. V. A. Gluzdovsky, commander of 31st Army, deployed the 36th Corps north of the Smolensk-Orsha road, with the 359th and 215th Rifle Divisions in the first echelon, facing the defenses of the German 197th Infantry Division. Over the next three days, the reinforced Corps, in tandem with the attack of 5th Army to the north, unhinged the German defenses north of the highway and drove them westwards through the village of Ermaki. Further Soviet pressure over the following days forced the 197th Infantry to withdraw on October 9 to a new positions astride the highway from Krasnoe to Gerasimenki. These could not be held, and a further retreat took place on the 11th, when the German forces took up yet another defensive line, from Shcheki on the Verkhita River, southward across the highway at Redki, to the Dniepr at Novaia. At this point General Gluzdovsky was ordered to halt briefly and prepare for a new assault on October 12.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 65-66 The second Orsha offensive began with an 85-minute artillery preparation, which was largely ineffective due to a timely withdrawal by the defenders to their second trench line. In heavy fighting over the next two days, 31st Army's attack stalled at considerable cost and with no appreciable gains. Over the next ten days Western Front carried out a major regrouping which, among other things, moved part of the Army south of the highway. The 65th Guards Rifle Division was transferred from 10th Guards Army and relieved units of the 359th during the night of October 23 in the Sharino region. When the offensive was renewed that day, the division was in the second echelon. The frontal assault smashed the defenses of the 197th Infantry, again at huge cost in casualties, and penetrated as much as 4km deep, but the commitment of armor from 2nd Guards Tank Corps the following day produced gains of less than a kilometre. The 359th was brought up with other units from the second echelon on the 24th, but ran into heavy German artillery fire, to which they had no effective reply due to low ammunition stocks. A halt was ordered late on October 26, and the Soviet forces dug in.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 71-74, 79-81, 85-87 By the time the fourth Orsha offensive began on November 14, the rifle divisions of Western Front were down to an average strength of 4,500 men. On the first day the 338th Rifle Division advanced about 1.5km, but the remaining divisions of 31st Army bogged down in the German security zone under withering machine-gun fire. On the next day the Army made no further progress at all, and General Gluzdovskii ordered the second echelon divisions of 36 Corps into combat. In five days of intense fighting an advance of no more than 4km was accomplished; Western Front's total casualties amounted to 38,756. Yet another attack began on November 30, with no progress being made at all on 31st Army's front and another heavy toll in casualties.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 157, 161-64, 168 In December the 359th was removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding. In January 1944, it was reassigned to the 1st Ukrainian Front, where it would remain for the duration.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 93 To begin with it was assigned to the 47th Rifle Corps in 27th Army, then to 102nd Rifle Corps in the Front reserves, and by April 1 to 23rd Rifle Corps in 60th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 28, 43, 75, 104 The division remained in this Army until September, when it was transferred to the 38th Army. At this time, the 221st Antitank Battalion had been reequipped with ZIS-3 76mm guns, three batteries of four guns each, plus an antitank rifle platoon with seven ATRs.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 93 Siege of Breslau In January 1945, the 359th was reassigned with 76th Rifle Corps from 3rd Guards Army to 6th Army. Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, pp. 18, 53 The division would remain in this Army for the duration, once again coming under the command of Lt. Gen. V. A. Gluzdovsky. During the Lower Silesian Offensive Operation, 6th Army was given responsibility for the siege and capture of Breslau, beginning on February 13. On April 5 the 359th was recognized for its role in forcing a crossing of the Oder River northwest of the city with the award of the Order of the Red Banner. During the course of the siege, Private Vasily Ivanovich Nechval, a light machine-gunner of the 1198th Rifle Regiment, was noted for his valor in one of the crossing operations in the early stages of the siege, and on June 27 was recognized with the award of the Gold Star of a Hero of the Soviet Union (Medal No. 8154).http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=7186 Postwar By the end of the war the division had earned the full title 359th Rifle, Yartsevo, Order of the Red Banner Division: (Russian: 322-—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –Ø—Ä—Ü–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è). On June 4, in further recognition of its successful service in the final reduction of Breslau the division was awarded the Order of Lenin, a rare distinction for an ordinary rifle division.

It was designed by Thomas Pye and built in 1914 by L. Baldry. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  Post and telegraph facilities were available at Cooroy railway station from 1892. The facilities moved from the station to the present site of the Post Office in 1911 when the townspeople and the Australian Government decided to use the building originally built for the chambers of the Noosa Shire Council as a post office. It was leased by the Postmaster-General for this purpose. In October 1911, the Queensland Governor approved the sale of the land to the Australian Government for the purpose of a post and telegraph office at a cost of , with first post master appointed being Mr Campbell. E.G. Chinnery was appointed permanent post master in April 1912. A Morse Code telegraph instrument was installed in the building at the start of September 1912. The Australian Government called tenders for a new post office to the design of acting Queensland Government Architect, Thomas Pye, in 1913 to be erected alongside the existing building. In January 1914 the contact to erected the new building was awarded to L. Baldry for . Local sawmills supplied the timber. The new post office was ready to open in September 1914, with the building described as \\"a neat and substantial structure\\" and the predication that it \\"should provide ample accommoation for many years to come\\" (and indeed the post office has been in use of 100 years). In November 1914, a new telephone switchboard was installed, improving the telephone service. Later works of the 1940s through to the 1960s, included construction of an additional verandah on the southern side of building, and may also have included replacement of original casement sash windows in the front elevation with awning sash windows. Other later works included the addition of a single-storey flat roofed building to the north of the main office area; the sub-floor areas enclosed with cream brick dwarf walls; the rear verandah enclosed to form staff lunch room; and in the 1980s and 1990s refurbishment of the internal office area and upgrade of retail facilities. In 1996 a disabled access ramp and extension to the non- original verandah were installed across the south side of the building; the brick addition on the north side of the building also appears to have been removed by that date.  Description  Cooroy Post and Telegraph Office, newly built Cooroy Post Office is at 33 Maple Street, corner of Garnet Street, Cooroy, comprising the whole of Lot 2 RP147678. Cooroy Post Office, dating from 1914, is located on a gently sloping, regularly-shaped corner site which is defined on the west by the town's principal commercial and retail street, Maple Street. The original post office building is raised above street level and the frontage addresses Maple Street, though the majority of the private letter box bays and rear access is via the Crystal Street frontage. The elevated corner site also allows for some views of the building \\"in the round\\". The street corner of the site is marked by a cast iron pillar posting box marked \\"JS Engineering Co., Brisbane\\", added at a later date. The site is enclosed by an early timber post and \\"Cyclone\\" wire fence and is flanked to the east by the automatic telephone exchange, constructed on the eastern half of the site around the late 1960s. The remaining site area is unbuilt. The Maple Street elevation presents a broad projecting wing on its north side, with a timber-planked spandrel approximating half-timbering. Below that is a non-original signage panel and paired window bay containing non-original timber-framed awning and fixed sashes screened by a timberframed sunhood. The projecting bay is flanked by the original entrance verandah which screens the remaining west elevation and is accessed via the altered front steps or more recent concrete and timber disabled access ramp. The verandah return along the southern elevation was added in two stages, c.1960 and 1996. The original verandah has a simple timber-framed balustrade and carved verandah brackets; the later verandah areas have been detailed to match. The verandah has a galvanised steel roof, an integral bellcast form with the main roof structure. The walls beneath the verandah retain sections of exposed stud frame but have been altered to accommodate additional bays of non-original private letter boxes. The main post office entry is through a non-original glazed door from the main verandah, in place of the original paired timber doors. The front elevation is otherwise filled with bays of non-original private letter boxes and a central doorway in lieu of the original single bay of letter boxes, single door located further south and later public telephone booth. The utilitarian rear elevation is a composition of hipped-roofed bays relating to the original store rooms and recessed central verandah/porch area. The rear verandah bay has now been infilled, the steps reconfigured and the original fenestration has been altered a number of times from the original larger windows with sunhoods to a series of smaller bathroom windows. The original design of Cooroy Post Office was an asymmetrically-composed double-fronted building housing a moderately-scaled postal hall and telegraph office with combined public space and small integrated telephone exchange room. The planning arrangement provided dual but independent operation of the postal and telegraphic functions around the single postal hall and counter with minimal space for mail sorting, telegraphic functions and staff facilities. The key alterations to the building concern the addition of extra private letter boxes and public verandahs on the southern side of the building, brick infill of the former timber panels to elevated base of the front elevation, alterations to interior planning for the provision of a retail post shop and later the gradual removal of the telegraphic and telephone functions of the building and general refurbishment of the place. The building's original plan form has been altered by changes to circulation and function resulting in the removal of walls throughout the office and alterations to the south verandah. A small number of internal elements such as joinery details and timber-lined walls and bulkheads, serve to demonstrate the original aesthetic quality and configuration of the original interior spaces, though in the case of the public space, this is new fabric associated with relining of the space. Notwithstanding the changed pattern of use and the enlarged verandah areas, the external presentation of the building is still able to demonstrate aspects of the original design, including the hipped and gabled roof form, the projecting public space gabled bay, entrance verandah, weatherboard-clad elevations and various timberwork details. The original fabric of the building comprises: * Structural frame: Timber floor, wall and roof framing on timber pole stumps. * External walls: Timber weatherboard cladding to stud-framed walls; original verandah areas had exposed vertical and horizontal studs; sub- floor spaces enclosed by vertical timber battens. * Internal walls: Lined with V-jointed timber lining boards; expressed hardwood stud frame; finished with moulded timber architraves. * Floor: Timber floor boards with narrow moulded timber skirting boards. Ceiling: V-jointed timber board-lined ceilings with moulded timber cornices. * Roof: Hipped bellcast form with broad projecting gabled bay and integral verandahs; all roof probably clad with crimped iron or possibly corrugated galvanised iron. Exposed rafters with verandah soffits lined with beaded timber lining boards. Front gable features simple fretwork screen to end and timber name board bearing the inscription \\"POST & TELEGRAPH OFFICE\\". * Single and paired timber-framed casement sashes which are screened by timber-framed sunhoods to the north, west and east elevations. Original drawings do not indicate sunhoods on southern windows, however they are evident in a photograph taken in 1948. * Timber framed verandahs are integral with main roof in a bellcast form and are finished with simple timber balustrades, steps and paired verandah posts with carved brackets. Internal doors are four-panelled timber with glazed operable fanlight over. * Grounds originally enclosed by timber post and rail fence with Cyclone wire infill. From about 1946 tp 1957, various alterations occurred including construction of additional verandah area along the southern side of building and may have included replacement of original casement sash windows in front elevation with awning sash windows, the construction of external public telephone cabinet on footpath adjacent to northwest corner of building and the installation of additional private letter boxes. At some time prior to 1989, a single-storey flat roofed building was constructed to north of main office area, the sub- floor areas were enclosed with cream brick dwarf walls, lower sashes of front windows infilled and original room at northeast corner of building subdivided and refurbished with FC linings to provide internal staff toilet facilities. The rear verandah is enclosed to form staff lunch room. Garnet Street side view with disabled ramp, 2012 Around 1988 to 1990 there was a refurbishment of the office area to upgrade retail facilities. Works included demolition of existing private letter boxes, original timber entrance steps and balustrade and internal partition walls within public space and mail room. Installation of enlarged private letter box bays into side verandah area, new floor finishes, lighting, removal of skirting boards and some joinery, reconstruction of timber wall linings in public space and some plasterboard wall linings, installation of new cornices and counter joinery. In 1996, there was refurbishment and upgrade of the retail facilities. A disabled access ramp and extension to the non-original verandah were installed across the south side elevation. The brick addition on the north side of the building appears to have been removed by this date. In 2004, new counter joinery was installed in public space and retail display units were upgraded. = Condition = Externally and internally the building is in sound condition, well maintained and with no major defects visible.  Heritage listing  The significant components of Cooroy Post Office include the main 1913 post office building, but do not include later additions such as the public verandahs on the southern side, disabled access ramp, the single-storey flat-roofed addition to the north of the main office area and the 1960s telephone exchange on the east. The cast iron pillar posting box marked \\"JS Engineering Co., Brisbane\\", located at the street corner of the site, is object of significant interest, but it is not known if the pillar box is actually located on Australia Post property (and hence not eligible for inclusion on the Commonwealth Heritage List). Cooroy Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Cooroy Post Office, opened in 1913 and built to a design by the Queensland Government Architect Office under AB Brady, has some historical value as a post office remaining in continuous operation since the early twentieth century. This value, however, is enhanced through the post office being one of a limited number of generally modestly-scaled timber post offices still in operation. It is also an extension of contemporary progressive residential work in Queensland and one of the few examples of this development remaining as an operating post office. Although alterations to the building over a long period have had some impac on its heritage value, it remains significant at a local level. Criterion D: Characteristic values Cooroy Post Office is an example of: * a post and telegraph office (second generation typology 1870-1929); * a Federation period single porch and gable timber form with integrated exchange; * the work of the Queensland Government Architect Office under AB Brady. Typologically, Cooroy Post Office, built in 1913, was constructed towards the close of a second typology of post offices dated 1870 - 1929. These post offices generally incorporated a separate component for the telegraph functions in addition to a postmaster's residential quarters. In this instance, however, there was no accommodation for a residence. In the state context, this particular grouping of functions is considered as a descriptor of a post office type known as T18 (Single Porch, Gable and Lantern example) of which 14 known examples were built throughout Queensland during 1909-1913. Cooroy was constructed towards the end of this phase. The typology of the building has been impacted by alterations including the gradual removal of the telegraphic and telephone functions from the building; and changes to circulation resulting in the removal of interior walls throughout. A small number of internal elements such as joinery details and timber-lined walls and bulkheads, serve to demonstrate the aesthetic quality and configuration of the original interior spaces, although in the case of the public space, this is predominantly new fabric associated with reconfiguration of the space. Architecturally and stylistically, Cooroy Post Office is a good if not high order example of Queensland's Federation-era timber post office designs, although alterations to the planning and form, including the enlarged verandah areas, have had some impact on the building's principal frontages to Maple and Garnet streets. While the building is still able to demonstrate aspects of the original design, including the hipped and gabled roof form, the projecting public space gabled bay, entrance verandah, and various timberwork details, the more recent alterations including the disabled ramps, additional private letter box bays and alterations to the entrance points of the building have impacted on the building's presentation. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Cooroy Post Office, with its prominent bay, return verandah form, and elevated siting with views of the building \\"in the round\\", has some visual presence in its streetscape context, and retains early or original elements and detailing which point to its Federation origins.

It is captured in the folklore of the Nandi as a distinct process composed of a series of inward migrations by members from various Kalenjin ortinwek. Origins According to the Kalenjin narrative of origin, the Nandi identity formed from the separation of what had been a combined group of Kipsigis and Nandi. They had been living at Rongai near Nakuru as a united group for sometime before they were forced to separate due to antagonistic environmental factors, notably droughts and invasion of the Maasai from Uasin Gishu.Chesaina, C.

About this time they moved southwards through country occupied by Masai, \\"probably the present Uasin Gishu country\\" where they accidentally got split in two by a wedge of Masai who Orchadson records as being \\"Uasin Gishu (Masai) living in Kipchoriat (Nyando) valley\\".

Ortinwek origins The Nandi account of the formation of the tribe however displays a more complex pattern of settlement. The Kalenjin ortinwek that moved into and occupied the Nandi area, thus becoming the Nandi tribe, came; * From Elgon & Lumbwa :Kipoiis :Kipamwi :Kipkenda :Kipiegen * From Lo-'sekelae Masai :Kipkoiitim (also partly from Elgon) :Talai, the medicine men's clan (partly also from Kamasya) :Toyoi * From Elgon :Kipkokos * From Elgon & Elgeyo :Kipsirgio :Moi :Sokom :Kiptopkei :Kamwaikei * From Lumbwa :Tungo :Kipaa :Kipasiso and Kapchemuri (Chemuri) :Elgoni (Kony) Territory =Settlement= The traditional Nandi account is that the first settlers in their country came from Elgon and formed the Kipoiis clan; a name that possibly means 'the spirits'. They were led by a man named Kakipoch, founder of the Nandi section of the Kalenjin and are said to have settled in the emet (county) of Aldai in south-western Nandi. One of the earliest Bororiet was named after Kakipoch and the site of his grave, still shown on Chepilat hill in Aldai was marked by the stump of an ancient olive tree. The account of his burial is that his body was laid on ox-hide, together with his possessions, and left for the hyenas. Studies of the settlement pattern indicate that the southern regions were the first to be settled. As of 1910, these were the emet of Aldai on the west and the, by then annexed, emet of Soiin on the east. It was conjectured that the first pororosiek were Kakipoch in Aldai and Tuken in Soiin. It is notable that Sirikwa holes (known to the Nandi as mukowanisiek) were almost non-existent in the areas first settled, being only present on the Nandi escarpment itself. They were however found in great numbers in the northern regions of Nandi. =Central emotinwek= Inward migrants and general population growth are thought to have led to a northward expansion of the growing identity during the eighteenth century. This period is thought to have seen the occupation and establishment of the emotinwek of Chesume, Emgwen and Masop. This period would also have seen the establishment of more pororosiek. =Northern emotinwek= The final expansion occurred during the middle of the nineteenth century when the Nandi took the Uain Gishu plateau from the Uasin Gishu. Traditions contained in the tale of Tapkendi however seem to indicate that the plateau was previously held by the Nandi and that Nandi place names were superseded by Maasai names. This as was noted is further evinced by certain \\"Masai place-names in eastern Nandi which indicate that the Masai had temporary possession of strip of Nandi roughly five miles wide\\", these include Ndalat, Lolkeringeti, Nduele and Ol- lesos, which were by the early nineteenth century in use by the Nandi as koret (district) names. Early-19th Century Kipsigis traditions such as those recorded by Orchadson (1927), state that at a time when the Kipsigis and Nandi were a united identity, they moved southwards through country occupied by 'Masai'. Orchadson notes that this was \\"probably the present Uasin Gishu country\\". Here, they accidentally got split in two by a wedge of Masai who Orchadson records as being \\"Uasin Gishu (Masai) living in Kipchoriat (Nyando) valley\\". Accounts from Hollis however refer to a \\"branch called 'L-osigella or Segelli [who] took refuge in the Nyando valley but were wiped out by the Nandi and Lumbwa...It was from them that the Nandi obtained their system of rule by medicine-men. This coincides with Maasai traditions which note that the Loosekelai (who are associated with the Siger i.e Sigerai) were attacked by an alliance of the Uasin Gishu and Siria communities. No date is given for the Kipsigis and Nandi fracture which would be contemporaneous with the dates of establishment of these identities. However, Dobbs (1910) made notes on the initiation age-sets of the Lumbwa. He noted that the oldest age-set he could get notes on were the Maina who were initiated around 1856. None of this age- set or the following were alive at the time. He noted that the oldest interviewees and indeed the oldest Lumwba individuals at the time were between 64-67 years. He noted that they had been initiated in 1866 when they were about twelve to fifteen years old. In spite of the oldest interviewees being alive at the time of the Maina initiations, Dobbs notes that \\"Although I made the most careful inquiries,I could find out nothing whatever about any circumcision age prior to 'Maina' (1856)\\". =Elgon & Lumbwa origins= Chemwal identity The Nandi (or earlier Chemwal) identity is seen to have formed when Kakipoch settled with settlers from Elgon in Nandi. Tradition states that the Kipoiis clan were later joined by people from Lumbwa. From the Kalenjin narrative of origin, a distinct Chemwal (predating Nandi) identity appears to have formed when the Nandi and Lumbwa sections separated. They are said to have been escaping a variety of factors, notably drought and attack by the Uasin Gishu Maasai.Chesaina, C. Oral Literature of the Kalenjin. Heinmann Kenya Ltd, 1991, p. 1 The Kipsigis moved southwards, settling around Kericho while the Nandi continued west and settled at Aldai.Chesaina, C. Oral Literature of the Kalenjin. Heinmann Kenya Ltd, 1991, p. 30 Both traditions thus concur in placing the Elgon and Lumbwa origins clans as the drivers of a differentiated Chemwal identity. Certain peculiarities were recorded about these clans that may point to the circumstance of settlement. For instance, the Kipoiis were not permitted to build their homes by the roadside, indicating a prior settlement pattern where the opposite might have been the case and a general retreat away from accessible places.Chesaina, C. Oral Literature of the Kalenjin. Heinmann Kenya Ltd, 1991, p. 8 Both are known to be the case, given the social climate of the time. Peculiarities recorded about the Kipamwi however, indicate that they might have been ancestral to the region. The previous area of occupancy of the Kipamwi was Mt. Elgon, Sotik and Kosowa (the latter two forested regions in prior times). Further the Kipamwi of the turn of the nineteenth century were \\"great hunters and (lived) largely by the chase\\", they also were not allowed to plant millet nor could they interact \\"whatsoever with the smiths\\", they were not \\"even\\" allowed to \\"build their huts in the proximity of the smiths, buy their weapons direct from them, or allow their goats to meet the goats belonging to the smiths on the road\\". =Elgon& Elgeyo origins= c.1830 Retreat from Elgon Nandi occupied territory previously stretched as far north as the sources of the Nzoia River i.e. Mt. Elgon, a territory that had been occupied by the Nandi as lately as the mid-19th century. The Karamojong raided the northern Nandi sections twice before the Nandi launched a big raid against them at Choo hill near the junction of Kanyangareng & Turkwel rivers. The Masinko clan of Karamojong who were pasturing here counterattacked and successfully drove of the Nandi raiders. In response to the Nandi raid, the Karimojong organized a powerful force to break up the Nandi nearest the Turkwel-Nzoia watershed but the expedition returned and reported that the Nandi had withdrawn too far south. The Karamojong were unmolested by the Nandi from that time and the Turkwel- Nzoia watershed became a no-mans land.Turpin, C., The occupation of the Turkwel river area by the Karamojong tribe, The Uganda Journal, 1916 online Certain broad peculiarities regarding those clans that interacted with the Karamojong bore similarities. For instance, these clans were generally prohibited from crossing into prior southern zones of influence. The Sokom for example, were prohibited from settling in Kavirondo or Lumbwa, the Moi were not allowed to raid in Kamasia or in Kavirondo and the Kamwaike were prohibited from settling in Nyangori. =Segelai Maasai= c.1830 Uasin Gishu - Siger war The traditions recorded by Orchadson date contact with the population in Kipchoriat valley to the about the same time as the formation of Nandi identity. The traditions collected by Dobbs dates this to the early 19th century. This is congruent with current understanding of the Orkoinotet whose establishment among the Nandi is dated to the early 19th century. The clans that interacted with the Siger shared many of the similarities of the Nandi clans of the period. The Talai for instance were not allowed to settle in Nyangori or Kamasia. There were particular privileges that became attached to the Orkoinotet, maybe since inception or during the course of the century. These included such rights as the right to keep donkeys - a stock animal of the expansive northern districts. This right was barred to other clans including the Uasin Gishu smiths who would come with donkeys during later decades. Hollis also made note of the fact that the Orkoiyot's wives \\"may do no work, all their household duties being performed by servants, called otuagik\\". These privileges largely rested with the bearer of the office however and did not extend to the clan, though all children of the Talai clan wore a special necklace made of gourds, known as septook. c.1850 =Lumbwa origins= The second Lumbwa stream of clans consisted of the Tungo, Kipaa, Kipasiso and Kapchemuri (Chemuri) as well as Elgoni (Koni). Certain peculiarities recorded about these clans may point to skills that they brought with them. For instance, by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Kipasiso were highly sought out and \\"engaged to erect the korosiot sticks at weddings\\". This clan was thus perceived and possibly possessed of some form of knowledge surrounding wedding rituals. The Tungo at the same time, were \\"held in high esteem, and one of their number is selected as a judge or umpire in all disputes\\". This clan might thus have been perceived or displayed characteristics of sober mindedness or perhaps a prior knowledge of a superior (i.e in relation to perceived justice) set of laws. =Elgon origins= References Category:Kalenjin Category:Tribes of Africa Category:African folklore ","title":"Settlement of Nandi"},{"id":"58619881","text":"Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Pesado P√©rez (Palmar de Bravo, Puebla, New Spain, 9 February 1801 ‚Äî Mexico City, 3 March 1861) was a Mexican writer, journalist, poet and politician.

The Dos Leyendas show took place on March 17, 2017 in CMLL's main venue, Arena M√©xico, Mexico City, Mexico. The event was to honor and remember CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth, who died in March 1987. Starting in 1999 CMLL honored not just their founder during the show, but also a second lucha libre legend, making it their version of a Hall of Fame event. For the 2017 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of Arturo D√≠az Mendoza, better known under the ring name Villano III.. This was the 19th March show held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas name, having previously been known as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth from 1996 to 1998. The main event of the show was a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, where Diamante Azul defeated Pierroth, forcing Pierroth to unmask after the loss and state his birth name, Arturo Mu√±oz S√°nchez. The Sky Team (M√≠stico, Valiente and Volador Jr) successfully defend the CMLL World Trios Championship against Los Hijos del Infierno (Luciferno and Mephisto) and Hechicero. √öltimo Guerrero successfully defended the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship against Matt Taven in the fourth match of the night. Production =Background= Since 1996 the Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a show in March each year to commemorate the passing of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth who died in March 1987. For the first three years the show paid homage to Lutteroth himself, from 1999 through 2004 the show paid homage to Lutteroth and El Santo, Mexico's most famous wrestler ever and from 2005 forward the show has paid homage to Lutteroth and a different leyenda (\\"Legend\\") each year, celebrating the career and accomplishments of past CMLL stars. Originally billed as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth, it has been held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") since 1999 and is the only show outside of CMLL's Anniversary shows that CMLL has presented every year since its inception. All Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2017 show was the 23rd overall Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show produced by CMLL. =Storylines= The Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. =Homage to Salvador Lutteroth and Villano III= In September 1933 Salvador Lutteroth Gonz√°lez founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), which would later be renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Over time Lutteroth would become responsible for building both Arena Coliseo in Mexico City and Arena Mexico, which became known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". Over time EMLL became the oldest wrestling promotion in the world, with 2018 marking the 85th year of its existence. Lutteroth has often been credited with being the \\"father of Lucha Libre\\" introducing the concept of masked wrestlers to Mexico as well as the Luchas de Apuestas match. Lutteroth died on September 5, 1987. EMLL, late CMLL, remained under the ownership and control of the Lutteroth family as first Salvador's son Chavo Lutteroth and later his grandson Paco Alonso took over ownership of the company. The life and achievements of Salvador Lutteroth is always honored at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, since 1999 CMLL has also honored a second person, a Leyenda of lucha libre, in some ways CMLL's version of their Hall of Fame. In 2017 CMLL chose to honor Arturo D√≠az Mendoza, best known under the ring name Villano III (\\"Villain 3\\") for his life and career in Lucha Libre. Arturo Mendoza was the middle son of wrestler/promoter Ray Mendoza, following Jos√© de Jes√∫s D√≠az Mendoza (aka. Villano I) and Jos√© Alfredo D√≠az Mendoz (Villano II) and younger brothers Raymundo D√≠az Mendoza Jr. (Villano V) and Tomas D√≠az Mendoza (Villano V). His career really took off when Ray Mendoza, Francisco Flores and Benjamin Mora Jr. broke away from CMLL to form the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) where Arturo became one of the stars of their lighter weight divisions holding the UWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship, the UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship, the UWA World Light Heavyweight Championship twice, the UWA World Welterweight Championship and the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship 7 times.Though Villano III won the title seven times, none of the reigns are officially recognized by the WWE. No reign prior to December 1997 is officially recognized by the WWE. Over the years Villano III defended his mask in a multitude of Luchas de Apuestas matches, with more than 30 mask wins on his record, including unmasking Super Astro and Pegasus Kid. In late-1999/early-2000 Villano III started a storyline feud with Atlantis that led to both wrestlers putting their mask on the line at the 2000 Juicio Final. Villano III lost the match and his mask in what was voted as the Wrestling Observer Match of the Year for 2001. In subsequent years Arturo's career slowed down as age and injuries took a toll on him. He finally retired in 2015 due to diminishing eyesight and deteriorating knees. Aftermath After his mask loss, Mu√±oz adopted the ring name \\"La Bestia del Ring\\", (\\"The Beast of the Ring\\" in English) and became an official member of Los Ingobernables. In the months after his mask loss, Mu√±oz became involved in a storyline feud with Vangelys, where Mu√±oz defeated Vangelys in a Lucha de Apuestas match, with Vangelys being shaved bald as a result. Sky Team's run as CMLL World Trios Champions ended the following year on July 1 as they lost the championship to Los Guerreros del Infierno (Euforia, Gran Guerrero and √öltimo Guerrero). √öltimo Guerrero's NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship reign lasted for over a year, days, until Car√≠stico won the championship on August 21, 2018. His challenger, Matt Taven returned to CMLL for several tours over the following years, including winning and losing the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship (1 time from Volador Jr., as well as team up with Volador Jr. to lose in the main event of the CMLL 85th Anniversary Show to Rush and B√°rbaro Cavernario in a lucha de apuestas match.

The house, Broughton House or Broughton Hall, was built 1841 and variously served as a residence for prominent businessmen and public figures (1841-1914). It is situated within the Callan Park Conservation Area, in Church Street, Lilyfield, near the corner of Wharf Road. It was used as No. 13 Australian Army Hospital during World War I. Other buildings were constructed over time and the precinct was used as the Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic (1921-1976). It was merged into Rozelle Hospital along with the adjacent Callan Park Hospital for the Insane in 1976, during which time it became the first premises for the Rivendell Child, Adolescent and Family Unit. Broughton House fell into disuse, suffering severe damage from fire and vandalism. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous settlement and early European colonisation= Before European settlement the Wangal clan or band lived at the site and their territory extended along the Parramatta River from about Petersham westward. The Wangal were part of the Eora or Dharug tribes. Due to a small pox epidemic between 1789 and 1790 and European land development, only about 50 people from Dharug families were living in the Sydney area by 1900. European settlement formed in the Leichhardt area with 15 land grants assigned between 1789 and 1821. The areas west of the peninsula were slow to develop; however, the later land grants were instrumental in developing the future Rozelle Hospital site. Francis Lloyd received 50 acres in 1819 and Luke Ralph received 50 acres in 1821, these adjoining grants stretching from Long or Iron Cove to Rozelle Bay. To their west, Lawrence Butler received 100 acres in 1819. These grants were in common ownership by the 1840s, becoming the Garry Owen Estate, later to become known as Callan Park. To the west of Butler's grant was a 100 acre grant assigned to John Austen in 1819, initially known as \\"Spring Cove Estate\\" but by the 1840s known as \\"Austenham\\". The estate had two significant houses on it: Austenham or Kalouan (demolished 1932) and Broughton Hall or Broughton House. John Keep changed the name from Broughton House to Broughton Hall. In 1884 and 1885 the property appeared in Sands Sydney Directory as \\"Broughton.\\" Then, in the 1886 directory it appeared as \\"Broughton Hall.\\"Sands Sydney Directory, J Sands, Sydney, 1886, Page 238 Change from Broughton House to Broughton Hall. Accessed 10 December 2019. The Broughton House/Austenham estate was separated from the Garry Owen Estate by a line formed by the extension northward of Wharf Road. The Garry Owen Estate was originally owned by Crown Solicitor and Police Magistrate John Ryan Brenan. His house, Garry Owen House, was built about 1839, possibly designed by Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis. Brenan, a man of keen horticultural interests, developed a large garden and lived at Garry Owen until 1865.Tanner & Associates, 2001, 36 =Broughton Hall as residence= For many years, Garry Owen was a focus for social life in the area. In 1841, Brenan bought an additional three acres west of his estate and built Broughton House (on the opposite side of Wharf Road from his own large estate, Garry Owen), Burge, 2001, 17) which he then sold with its extensive grounds in 1845. When Brenan advertised for lease in December 1842 the advertisement mentioned: \\"A house near Garry Owen, consisting of four sitting rooms, six bedrooms, housekeeper's room, house closet and store, wine cellar, butler's pantry, kitchen and back hall, coach house and stables...abundance of water on the land. The house is completed, and can be given immediately...stands in a position which commands a beautiful view of the Parramatta River and Lane Cove\\"Burge, 2001, 17 and in 1856 \\"...never-failing water hole and pump...\\".Craig Burton, pers.comm., in Popple, 2009 It is believed that water for Broughton House's fountains and ponds was originally fed from a natural spring, from between the clay and sandstone stratum.Popple, 2009 The construction of Pyrmont Bridge in 1857 and Glebe Island Bridge in 1862 and the Iron Cove Bridge in 1880 opened up land to the west of Rozelle and generated speculative subdivision. Although large estates were rapidly subdivided, the houses and original curtilage of Broughton House and Garry Owen House remained rare survivors. In 1871 there were just 112 houses in the municipality and 614 residents. By 1885 there were 2100 houses and 10,550 residents in what were solidly working-class suburbs. Brenan's bankruptcy in 1864 forced him to sell Garry Owen Estate to Sydney businessman John Gordon. Gordon renamed that property Callan Park, and in 1873 subdivided the land for auction as a new waterfront suburb. The Callan Estate (but not Broughton House estate to its west) was purchased by the Government of New South Wales in 1874, led by Henry Parkes. Charles Moore, then Director of the Botanic Gardens, was entrusted with designing the Callan Park grounds. Map showing location of Broughton Hall in Callan Park. From 1864 to 1905, Broughton House and nearby Kalouan (demolished in 1932) were the family homes of Sydney businessman John Keep.(Dictionary of Sydney entry, 'Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic') Keep lived there, extending it and purchasing adjoining land. After his death on 2 July 1905, his family sold the estate (the combined properties of Broughton Hall and Kalouan) to Annandale timber merchants William and Frederick Langdon in 1912. =Convalescent hospital= During World War I, the Langdons offered the site as a convalescent hospital for shell-shocked soldiers. The house and its expansive gardens were the perfect setting as a restorative home for soldiers. During the First World War changes to mental health care were instigated and in 1914 patients could only be treated if they were committed into one of the major institutions. Broughton Hall was resumed by the Government for repatriation care and this function became one of the main functions of Callan Park with additional facilities built in the grounds. Broughton Hall functioned as No. 13 Australian Army Hospital with the house and grounds used as a convalescent home for returned soldiers from the First World War, until 1921. A photograph of soldiers and nurses in the grounds was in \\"The Mirror of Australia\\" on 10 February 1918. During the early years of the 20th century health professionals pushed for early intervention in mental illness. =Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic= It was resumed by the government and on 4 April 1921 formally became the Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic. It opened as a voluntary admission clinic, NSW's first such. Through later years under Sydney Evan Jones, it became the largest such facility in Australia. The use of gardens was an integral part of the patients' treatment and paths, ponds and bridges were built throughout the grounds. Evan Jones redesigned Broughton Hall's gardens in the 1920s as a therapeutic environment for patients. New buildings of similar style and character, designed by the Government Architect, were added between 1920 and 1935. The part of Broughton Hall south of Church Street and east of Glover Street was redeveloped from 1956-64. Government Architect Michael Dysart designed the Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic complex here. Dysart's modernist design was innovative in its day, built on the concept of architecture and landscape as components of therapeutic psychiatric care. Its modernist style is unusual in the wider context of Callan Park or Rozelle Hospital, much of which is Victorian or Federation-era. Broughton Hall remained a discrete clinic until the NSW Department of Health amalgamated Broughton Hall and the neighbouring Callan Park Mental Asylum to form Rozelle Hospital in 1976. =Rozelle Hospital= Following the \\"Barclay Report\\" of 1988, which emphasised the need for a balance of services between community and hospital-based services, Rozelle Hospital underwent a significant upgrade, including restoration and refurbishment of some buildings and selling off of some land to fund the works. Construction of a new psychiatric complex located off the south-western corner of the Kirkbride block was commenced in 1991, and the use of the Kirkbride block for psychiatric care was subsequently phased out. Health services were increasingly scaled back over time, leaving many buildings in the larger complex empty. The original Broughton Hall building fell into disuse following the Rivendell Unit vacating the building to move to Concord West in 1977, becoming derelict, open to the elements, and suffering from the impact of vandalism. In 1986, it was damaged by fire. By the time of Broughton Hall's heritage listing in 1999, Rozelle Hospital was primarily operating from the former Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic buildings; although it continued to occupy over 100 buildings on the site, its namesake building continued to be disused. Rozelle Hospital closed in 2008. =Subsequent uses= The original Broughton Hall building was vacant and long-disused in 2011, despite the adaptive reuse of many of the associated clinic buildings. It was reported to be in \\"very poor\\" condition, having been \\"extensively damaged by fire, many additions and alterations\\", and the windows having been boarded-up. The Friends of Callan Park have expressed concern about vandalism and fire damage to the house and \\"serious neglect\\" of the heritage gardens. Following the closure of Rozelle Hospital, drug and alcohol service WHOS occupies a number of the former ward buildings, while the University of Tasmania opened their Rozelle campus in 2010 on another section of the former Broughton Hall clinic site.Heritage 21, 2015,11  Description  The original Broughton Hall building is a two-storey Victorian Georgian Revival style residence with additions in the 1880s. The walls are painted render, while the former slate roof has been replaced with concrete tiles. The site is unique in Sydney. The original house is now a shell but remains on its original acreage. It is possible to recognise in the structure of the garden today the same layout in photographs taken at Federation. It has expansive grounds comprising rainforest landscaping and other temperate climate trees and shrubs arrayed around a creekline running northeast of the house downhill to the Parramatta River. Terracing and level changes marked in brick and stone retaining walls are immediately north of Broughton Hall's main homestead. The rainforest gully is beyond that. Its grounds include rainforest species planting following the creek line north east of the house. Plantings date from across the late nineteenth and twentieth century, including some rare species.  Heritage listing  The house is one of the oldest remaining in the district and has strong associations with the early development and history of the Rozelle area. It is an impressive early Victorian Georgian residence. The house is set in extensive grounds, which retain much of their original layout, features and plantings, including a dense planting of NSW and other rainforest tree species, some sent and recommended by Charles Moore, then curator of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney. Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic gardens are of historic significance on a regional level in their demonstration of the views of Dr Sydney Evan Jones on the value of gardens in the care of the mentally ill.

It is one of the largest remains of Roman basilicas in Northern Africa. It was dedicated to St. Crispina to honor her martyrdom in 305 CE. This basilica was originally thought to have been created as a secular building for the Roman military; it developed into a religious building as new additions were built in the 4th and 5th century.  History  The Numidian region where Theveste was found became a key part of Rome's development after the fall of the Byzantine city of Carthage. Economic policies implemented in the Constitutional reforms of Julius Caesar created taxes on trade goods along Roman roads. When Roman legionary camp leader Legio III Augusta came to Theveste initially, he brought with him legionary forces and other travelers. His armies constructed roads throughout Northern Africa and established the first outposts for the Roman military in Theveste. With these incoming Roman military families, Theveste grew and additional buildings were added to the structure that would become the basilica, which might have been used at that point for the collection of taxes on goods like olive oil and grain. We have less evidence for activity in the city of Theveste after the Romans left sometime before 98 C.E. The roads that connected Carthage to Theveste and to Thamugade and Lambaesis had all been maintained and remained in good condition after other Roman roadways had suffered. In 295 C.E. a Christian man named Maximillian was martyred at Theveste for refusing to join military service. An inscription dated to 350 C.E. on the central niche mosaic of the basilica shrine is dedicated to Crispina, whose death took place in 305 C.E. Crispina's martyrdom would inspire pilgrimages to her shrine. This is the point where the basilica begins to gain its religious connotation. Due to the basilica's large size it was thought at this point to have served as a xenodochium in addition to providing other services such as baptisms and other church services.  Design  The central nave of the basilica The basilica's large size is due to the additions and modifications made by the various Roman and Byzantine leaders in the 4th and 5th century. The mosaic floors are accented by a pathway of balustrades marking the entrance into the great forecourt of the basilica. Through the nave and aisles there is a large staircase containing 20 steps and measuring about wide. A massive piscina is carved into the wall leading to a large open-air atrium. In the center of the atrium is a four- lobed fountain. At this four-way intersection, three archways remain standing in the hallways leading to the large nave and aisles of the main chapel. A pair of columns support the architrave where a gallery is located. A second altar footing can be found in the main chapel nave. The baptistery sits just down a staircase from the open-air atrium. In the baptistery there is a relief carved into the floor beneath where the ceremonial font would have been placed. The scalloped design and nature of the room would also suggest that large marble table tops were used for offerings as well as alters. Like other Roman Basilicas of the early Medieval era there is evidence of galleries that would have been used to display more mobile artwork. Additional buildings were added to the basilica complex between the 4th and 7th centuries, including a bathhouse, a garden, ground-floor stables and a martyrion. A smaller basilica was added to the complex in the 6th century.  References  = Bibliography = * Anderson, M. A. (2012).

Background  The CJIC was a successor organization to the Japanese Exclusion League, which was itself a successor to the Asiatic Exclusion League (AEL), originally known as the Japanese and Korean Exclusion League. Significant anti-Asian prejudice in the United States manifested first against Chinese laborers during the construction of the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s. By barring Chinese laborers, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in effect excluded most Chinese immigrants to the United States. Shortly after the turn of the century, rising numbers of Japanese immigrants led to anti-Japanese agitation and anti-Japanese sentiment on the West Coast. In order to quell the unrest, a diplomatic compromise known as the Gentleman‚Äôs Agreement was worked out between the United States and Japan. The agreement held that the United States would not restrict immigration from Japan, while Japan was not to allow further emigration to the United States. The Japanese and Korean Exclusion League was formed in San Francisco, California in May 1905, two months after the California State Legislature passed a unanimous resolution requesting that Congress ‚Äúlimit and diminish the further immigration of Japanese.‚Äù The resolution passed within a week after the San Francisco Chronicle began printing a series of anti-Japanese articles. The league was dedicated to excluding Japanese people from the United States and was funded mostly by the California Building and Construction Trades Council, a prominent labor union. In December 1907, it was renamed the Asiatic Exclusion League, which was then reorganized as the Japanese Exclusion League (JEL) in September 1920. The Japanese Exclusion League was a pressure group representing the interests of nativists, veteran‚Äôs organizations, women‚Äôs clubs, labor unions, and farmers. Its operations were led and largely financed by its volunteer special representative Valentine S. McClatchy, a former newspaper publisher. McClatchy and his friend Hiram Johnson, the senior U.S. Senator for California, were the leading figures in the effort to block Japanese immigration to the United States, which was realized with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924. McClatchy, accompanied by California Attorney General Ulysses S. Webb and former U.S. Senator James D. Phelan, testified before the Senate Committee on Immigration prior to the passage of the act. His testimony included the following remarks: > ‚ÄúJapanese are less assimilable and more dangerous as residents in this > country than any other of the peoples ineligible under our laws‚Ä¶They do not > come here with any desire or any intent to lose their racial or national > identity‚Ä¶They never cease being Japanese‚Ä¶In pursuit of their intent to > colonize this country with that race they seek to secure land and to found > large families‚Ä¶They have greater energy, greater determination, and greater > ambition than the other yellow and brown races ineligible to citizenship, > and with the same low standards of living, hours of labor, use of women and > child labor, they naturally make more dangerous competitors in an economic > way.‚Äù  Founding  After the passage of the 1924 Immigration Act, McClatchy took formal leadership of the Japanese Exclusion League, which was reorganized and renamed the California Joint Immigration Committee, in part because of ‚Äúthe prejudice which the name of the [earlier] organization created.\\" McClatchy regarded the new law as an insufficient means to combat the pro-Japanese ‚Äúorganized propaganda‚Äù directed by church activities. He thus formed the CJIC as an authorized and representative committee with an executive force and permanent office. The general aim of the CJIC at this early stage was to gain broad support for the maintenance of the new law, which did not allow for a quota of immigrants from Japan.  Supporting organizations  As Executive Secretary of the CJIC, McClatchy led a coordinating body composed of seven members. These included the executive officers of the following organizations, all of which shared an interest in maintaining Japanese exclusion from the United States. = The American Legion = The California department of this military veterans organization was concerned by potential Japanese aggression and had maintained an anti-Japanese position since its founding. Legion Adjutant James K. Fisk was Chairman of the CJIC. = Native Sons of the Golden West (NSGW) = NSGW was a brotherhood founded in 1876 whose membership was limited to those born in California. The organization was chiefly concerned with issues of nativism rather than the economic effects of Japanese immigration. John T. Regan of the NSGW was a Principal Member of the CJIC. = The California State Federation of Labor = The unskilled members of this 9,000-strong labor union were particularly opposed to Japanese immigrants, whom they believed undercut wages. Paul Scharrenberg, secretary of the union from 1910 to 1936, was a Principal Member of the CJIC. = The California State Grange = Representing farmers who ran small-scale operations, this organization opposed Japanese immigration due to the competition that Japanese farmers introduced to the state.  Opponents  Opposition to Japanese exclusion was strongest on the East Coast. The groups against exclusion and the CJIC‚Äôs activities consisted of various national and regional clergy associations, businessmen, institutes of higher education, and peace activists. The most prominent of these were as follows. = The National Committee on American Japanese Relations (NCAJR) = Led by former U.S. Attorney General George W. Wickersham, NCAJR was founded in 1921 by Sidney L. Gulick, an educator who spent twenty-five years as a missionary in Japan before returning to the United States. Once the Immigration Act of 1924 had been passed, NCAJR distributed pamphlets written by Gulick and fellow missionary . Gulick argued that excluding Japanese immigrants was damaging relations with Japan and that the only way to address the problem was to institute a quota. One line of attack used by the CJIC against NCAJR was that advocates for modification of the law were beholden to Japan on account of their past work and were therefore concerned more for the well-being of Japan rather than the United States. = Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America (FCCCA) = This ecumenical association of Protestant denominations publicly opposed the exclusion of Japanese immigrants and called for the immigration law to be changed so as to provide Japan with a quota. It was primarily concerned with the effect Japanese exclusion had on international relations. According to McClatchy, Gulick ‚Äúconverted‚Äù the leaders of the FCCCA to his point of view and, as leader of the organization‚Äôs Oriental Department, pushed anti-exclusion as an established church policy. = The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce = From the late 1920s to the late 1930s, businessmen on the West Coast who traded with Japan sought to modify the exclusion clause so as to permit Japan an immigration quota. Their efforts were coordinated by the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, which was mainly led by Wallace M. Alexander. Alexander was a businessman and trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  Operations  The purposes of the CJIC were: 1) to keep advised as to propaganda and efforts directed against the national policy of restrictive immigration; 2) to be prepared with data and literature to meet argument and attack; 3) to actively oppose anti-exclusion movements through distribution of literature and presentation of the facts by speakers. A 1925 pamphlet written by V.S. McClatchy, the Executive Secretary of the California Joint Immigration Committee (CJIC). The pamphlet expresses McClatchy's views on the necessity to maintain the exclusion of Japanese immigrants to the United States. To these ends, the CJIC kept in touch with the expressed sentiments of the Japanese, prepared and issued leaflets, and sought to ‚Äúremove cause for difference of opinion among Americans and restore better feeling on the part of the Japanese.\\" = Japanese exclusion = Support for Japanese exclusion was generally divided on the West Coast around the time when the CJIC was founded. A 1924 study conducted by the Japanese Foreign Office found that of nineteen California newspapers, ten were anti-Japanese and five were pro-Japanese, with the rest holding a neutral stance.  1925-1929  Throughout the second half of the 1920s, the CJIC and the most prominent members of the anti-exclusion movement fought over the righteousness of their causes. In a special issue of the English-language newspaper The Japan Times and Mail published five months after the passage of the immigration act, prominent Japanese citizens expressed their dissatisfaction with the exclusion clause. In response, the CJIC issued a pamphlet in which McClatchy argued that the Gentleman‚Äôs Agreement had been ‚Äúinefficient‚Äù and that the exclusion clause of the 1924 act was not due to racial prejudice. In December 1925, the Executive Committee of the FCCCA promulgated its new position on Japanese exclusion. Rather than continue to pursue a political solution, the FCCCA would work to educate the public and gain influential supporters throughout the country. The CJIC did not regard this as a retreat and so maintained its attacks against the FCCCA throughout 1926. In early 1927, the scope of the CJIC‚Äôs activities expanded to include opposition to immigration from Mexico and The Philippines. This was accompanied by a relative reduction in interest in Japanese exclusion. Within one year, the CJIC was primarily targeting Mexicans and Filipinos. McClatchy still maintained an interest in Japanese exclusion, as when he spoke out against an immigration quota for Japan while testifying to the House Immigration Committee in June of that year. In September 1928, the California State Grange withdrew from the CJIC. Late that year, the pro-quota movements were gaining momentum, with McClatchy admitting that his opponents were ‚Äústeadily gaining a psychological advantage.‚Äù In February of the following year, the CJIC resumed its attacks on pro-quota movements, beginning with a letter-writing campaign to California legislators.  1930-1934  With the onset of the Great Depression, business interests on the West Coast created their own pro-quota movement in hopes of stimulating more trade with Japan. Throughout 1930 and 1931, pro-quota movements continued to gain momentum, with several cities passing pro-quota resolutions. In July 1931, the Immigration Committee of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce passed its own pro-quota resolution. McClatchy protested by publishing another anti-quota pamphlet composed as an open letter to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce leader Wallace M. Alexander. After Japan invaded Manchuria in late 1931, McClatchy used the incident to argue that similar underhandedness would be employed by Japan against the United States in order to modify the immigration law. In mid-1933, pro-quota strength increased with the new support of Roy Howard of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain. McClatchy responded by seeking the support of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. The result was a conflict between the pro-quota Scripps- Howard newspapers and the anti-quota Hearst papers. In March 1934, a CJIC release raised the threat of ‚Äúa flood of immigrants from all the colored races of Asia.‚Äù  1935-1945  In February 1935, McClatchy published CJIC releases that claimed the Japanese government was distributing pro-Japanese textbooks in American public schools, particularly in Hawaii. No evidence was found to support this claim. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident of July 1937 and ensuing breakout of full-scale war between Japan and China, American public opinion of Japan dropped sharply. On May 15, 1938, McClatchy died of a heart attack at the age of eighty. He was succeeded as Executive Secretary of the CJIC by his son Harold Jedd. The CJIC continued to publicize the danger posed by Japan to Hawaii, issuing a release in October 1938 that warned of the ‚ÄúJapanese Threat to Dominate Hawaii.‚Äù The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, ended any hope for establishing an immigration quota for Japan. The CJIC subsequently supported the mass removal of Japanese Americans from the Pacific Coast. = Mexican exclusion = The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo made U.S. citizenship available to Mexicans residing in the lands won by the U.S. in the Mexican-American War. The treaty did not comment on the racial status of Mexicans. The right of Mexicans to obtain citizenship was confirmed in 1897 by a federal judge in Texas who ruled on the case In re Rodriguez. The Immigration Act of 1924 closed off immigration from the Eastern Hemisphere, but did not contain restrictive quotas for nations in the Western Hemisphere. Starting in the late 1920s, the CJIC advocated the exclusion of Mexican immigrants on the basis that they were not white or black and therefore could not become citizens under the Naturalization Act of 1790, revised in 1870. McClatchy and California Attorney General Ulysses S. Webb testified before Congress in 1929. According to McClatchy, Mexican Indians were ‚Äúof the Mongolian or Mongoloid race‚Äù and were therefore ineligible for American citizenship. The CJIC followed the message up in October of that year with a press release bearing the headline ‚ÄúMexican Indians Not Eligible for American Citizenship.‚Äù The CJIC‚Äôs strategy to achieve Mexican exclusion was to find a suitable test case for a federal court, a favorable ruling from which would overturn the precedents that had theretofore permitted Mexicans to immigrate to the U.S. and naturalize. McClatchy searched the nation for a suitable naturalization judge to whom the opportunity could be presented. In doing so, McClatchy colluded with John Murff, a naturalization examiner, and John Knight of the U.S. District Court in Buffalo. The case in question was In Re Andrade (1936). The petitioner Timoteo Andrade was a citizen of Mexico who had been residing in the U.S. for twenty years when he filed his naturalization petition. The case was ultimately decided in Andrade‚Äôs favor, marking a significant setback to Mexican exclusion.

Additionally, she served as the principal of a ladies' school for young girls that she ran out of various locations throughout her life.  Family  Sophia Mort was the daughter of James Mort (July 1770 ‚Äì 31 December 1827) and Dorothy Mort (c. 1773 ‚Äì 4 December 1848), Her father was heavily involved with the Methodist New Connexion church and was a deeply religious man. After hearing John Wesley preach at Sunderland when he was seventeen years old, he went from being essentially nonreligious to a convert to the Methodist New Connexion. He began his career as minister of in 1797 (the year that the church was established) and served as president of the New Connexion Conference in 1805 (Manchester) and 1821 (Nottingham). During his time as a minister (1807 - 1827), he was appointed to Circuits in the following areas: Sheffield (multiple times), Chester, Longton, Bolton, Thorne, Hull, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leeds, Hanley, Huddersfield (multiple times), Manchester (multiple times), and Liverpool (where he later died). Additionally, she was the second wife of William Allbut (4 March 1809 ‚Äì 15 February 1879). William Allbut was an editor and publisher of Pottery Mercury (or the North Staffordshire Mercury), a newspaper detailing the pottery industry in the Staffordshire area They had seven children: William Sidney Allbut (born c. 1838), Elizabeth Ann Allbut (born c. 1840), Thomas Henry Allbut (born 16 August 1842), Sophia Jane Allbut (born c. 1845), Mary Dorothea Allbut (born c. 1848), Helen Maria Allbut (born c. 1852), and James Allbut (born c. 1841). It is possible that James Allbut died in his youth, because his name only appears in the 1841 England Census, when he was merely months old. It is apparent that the Allbut and Mort families were closely connected, but the full extent of the connections is unknown. It is known that both families were involved with a printing press founded by a Mr. Strahan in 1786. The business was first passed to a J. Mort (first name unknown) and then to James Mort (Sophia Mort's father and most likely the son of J. Mort) in c. 1796. Later, John Allbut (William Allbut's grandfather) and Thomas Allbut (William Allbut's father) took over the business. This printing press published material from many genres including, but not limited to, children's literature, Christian literature, and books related to the pottery industry. Sophia's father-in-law Thomas Allbut (31 March 1777 ‚Äì 29 December 1857) was a New Connexion Methodist and publisher of children's literature (Elements of Useful Knowledge [1835]). Thomas Allbut and Sydney Allbut (c. 1779 ‚Äì 18 December 1851) his wife, are buried in the Allbut family burial vault below the Bethesda Methodist Chapel in Hanley along with Dorothy Mort (Sophia's mother), who occupies a single burial vault. The vault is now closed to the public as it has been vandalized.

Biography  = Childhood = Sophia Mort was born in Nottingham, England on 4 September 1807. While it is not known for certain, it is likely that some of Sophia's childhood was spent following her father to different areas across England while he preached. = Marriage and Life in Northwood = On 3 May 1837 Sophia Mort married William Allbut. At least as early as 1840 Sophia and William were living together in Northwood, Hanley, Staffordshire with Dorothy Mort (Sophia's mother), Elizabeth Mort (Sophia's sister), their children, a few governesses, and seven (or more) pupils. During their time in Northwood, Sophia and Elizabeth Mort ran a boarding and day school for young ladies, teaching them English education, needlework, and other skills. This school was advertised in William Allbut's newspaper the Potteries Mercury in December 1840. In 1842 an article that William Allbut published (and possibly wrote) made members of the Chartist movement angry and the Allbut's house was almost burnt to the ground. Luckily, troops prevented this from happening. = Life at \\"The Mount\\" = On 26 June 1844 William Allbut leased a mansion in Penkhull, Staffordshire called \\"The Mount\\" from Josiah Spode IV of Armitage Park (the great-grandson of Josiah Spode I) for a price of ¬£75 per year. In the terms of the lease it was agreed upon that \\"The Mount\\" could be used as a school for young ladies, but that no boys were to be taught there. Two days after the lease was signed William Allbut sent a letter to Josiah Spode IV requesting that he help repair some damage on the property (e.g. some of the gates) and telling him that his six-year-old son (William Sydney Allbut) would be \\"study and play\\" at the school, even though it was exclusively for girls. The new location of ladies' school at \\"The Mount\\" was first advertised in the Potteries Mercury on 13 July 1844. Then, on 20 January 1845, the Potteries Mercury ran a large advert for the ladies' school in which the school's focus on English education and physical activity (aided by the rural location of \\"The Mount\\") is advertised. Sophia Mort's teaching philosophy can be seen in one line of the advertisement which reads, \\"In this establishment the object of the teachers is to educate, not merely instruct the pupils.\\" The school is known to have taught French, Italian, music, and other basic aspects of 19th century English education for girls. Sophia's daughter Elizabeth Ann Allbut and son Thomas Henry Allbut were both students at this school, along with at least 30 female students (both English and international students). Along with Sophia, the school employed a music teacher, an English teacher, and a French teacher (who was a native of France). During the time that Sophia was running the ladies' school at \\"The Mount,\\" her husband William was working as a farmer of 43 acres, along with his normal line of work as a newspaper editor. It is unknown how long the Allbut family leased \\"The Mount,\\" but they were recorded as present there in the 1851 English Census. = Publishing History = In 1849 Sophia Mort's short story \\"Look to the End\\" was published in copies of The Youth's Magazine over the span of a year. The Youth's Magazine was a publication containing religious-themed short stories released on a monthly basis. Sophia Mort signed each monthly release of \\"Look to the End.\\" with her initials (S.A.). Later, in 1859, Sophia Mort's book Much in Little: A Compendium of Facts & Information was published by Routledge, Warnes, & Routledge found on Farringdon Street, London. When writing various copies of this book, she authors it under the names Mrs. Allbut or Mrs. Wm. Allbut (her husband's name), never referring to herself as Sophia. This book contains important names, dates, and facts that Mort deemed necessary for her audience (girls enrolled in 18th-century, English schools) to commit to memory. For instance, the book discusses biblical facts, astronomical terms, and English history, among many other topics. The book's purpose was not to replace oral instruction in the classroom or other textbooks being employed by the English school system. Rather, Mort states that her purpose in writing this compilation of information is to eliminate the need of the teacher and the student to consult numerous textbooks to find important facts. She writes that students should review various sections of the book at set intervals in order to memorize its information. Mort wrote the notice section of this book while in Rock Ferry, Cheshire, England in February 1859. Much in Little was advertised in \\"The Bookseller\\" (on 25 March, 25 May and 25 July 1859), \\"The Publishers' Circular\\" (1 April 1859 and 16 July 1859). =Later life= By 1861 Sophia and her family had moved to Chester Road in Lower Bebington where Sophia was still the principal of a ladies' school Her husband was now working as both an accountant and a farmer. At this time Sophia's sister Elizabeth Mort was working as an assistant teacher and Sophia's daughter Elizabeth Ann Allbut had begun working as the music teacher at her mother's school. By 1871 Sophia and her family had moved again, this time to Chester, where her husband was a farmer of 170 acres and she was still running the ladies' school. In addition to Elizabeth Ann Allbut working as a music teacher, Helen Maria Allbut now was working as a teacher and Elizabeth Mort was the vice president of the school. Sometime between 1871 and 1879 Sophia and her family moved to Hendon, Middlesex where her ladies' school followed her. On 15 February 1879 Sophia's husband died in Hendon and she became the head of her household. She continued to work alongside Elizabeth Mort, Elizabeth Ann Allbut, Mary Dorothea Allbut, and Helen Maria Allbut to manage the affairs of the ladies' school. Sophia Mort died at age 75 in Hendon, Middlesex, England on 13 September 1882. On 17 November 1882 Sophia's personal estate (totaling ¬£1,690 13s. 4d.) was granted to Elizabeth Ann Allbut (her eldest daughter).

Born to a Lithuanian peasant family active in book smuggling, he studied at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium and Sejny Priest Seminary and was active in Lithuanian cultural life. He started contributing articles to Lithuanian press, including Vienybƒó lietuvnink≈≥ and Varpas, in 1891. He continued his studies for a master's degree at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy where he formed a life-long friendship with fellow cleric Jurgis Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius. He earned his doctorate in theology at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland in 1901. In 1902, he became professor of apologetics and fundamental theology at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he participated in the Great Seimas of Vilnius and helped draft the program of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. Buƒçys was prorector and acting rector of the academy in 1912‚Äì1915, but resigned upon learning that he would not be promoted to rectors because he was not Polish. Together with Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius, Buƒçys joined the Congregation of Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception in 1909. At the time, the congregation was reduced to a single elderly member. Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius and Buƒçys spent considerable time and effort working on reviving and expanding the congregation. In 1916, Buƒçys traveled to United States to work with the newly established Marian Fathers in Chicago. He served as pastor to Lithuanian parishes in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and Waukegan, Illinois, and edited the struggling Lithuanian daily Draugas. In 1921, he returned to Lithuania and worked on organizing the Faculty of Theology at the new University of Lithuania. He was dean of the faculty in 1922‚Äì1923 and 1925‚Äì1926, as well as university prorector in 1923‚Äì1924 and rector in 1924‚Äì1925. After the death of Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius in 1927, Buƒçys was elected as the Superior-General of the Marian Fathers and moved to Rome. There he became an advisory member of the pontifical commission on Russia and was consecrated as titular bishop of Olympos on 6 July 1930. He was tasked with a Catholic mission to convert Eastern Orthodoxs and Old Believers to Eastern Catholicism. He visited Russian diaspora in Europe and United States working to organize parishes. In 1934, he was ordered to work on converting Russians in Lithuania. He worked for five years organizing Eastern Catholic masses, public lectures, and publications, but did not achieve any more noteworthy results. He was reelected as the Superior-General of the Marian Fathers in 1939 and moved to Rome where he lived until his death in 1951. Biography =Early life and education= B≈´ƒçys was born in the village situated on the ≈†e≈°upƒó river which acted as a natural border between Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire) and East Prussia. He was the eldest of eight children in a Lithuanian peasant family that owned 86 morgen of land and was active in Lithuanian cultural life. His uncle Pranci≈°kus B≈´ƒçys (1849‚Äì1925) was a pastor in Gelgaudi≈°kis and organized a circle of Lithuanian book smugglers. B≈´ƒçys' father Jonas, uncle and godfather Petras, and brother Juozas were all involved in book smuggling. His brother Andrius also became a priest. B≈´ƒçys as a student B≈´ƒçys received his first education at home before entering a primary school in in 1880. He studied at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium in 1883‚Äì1889 and at the Sejny Priest Seminary in 1890‚Äì1895. He was an average student and had to repeat the fifth year at the gymnasium and failed entrance exams to the seminary in 1889. Already as a cleric, B≈´ƒçys began contributing to the banned Lithuanian press. Together with Antanas Milukas and others, he organized a handwritten Lithuanian-language weekly newsletter, initially known as Knapt. It grew from 8 pages to 24 pages and changed titles to Visko po biskƒØ (A Little About Everything) and Viltis (Hope). B≈´ƒçys and wanted to organize a larger secret cleric society that would include members not only from Sejny but also from Kaunas and Vilnius Priest Seminaries. They held discussions with clerics in Kaunas and Vilnius, including about replacing ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos ap≈ævalga with another publication, but the plans did not come to fruition. Starting in 1891, B≈´ƒçys also contributed articles to ≈™kininkas, Vienybƒó lietuvnink≈≥, ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ ir Lietuvos ap≈ævalga, Varpas. In Varpas, he argued with editor Vincas Kudirka about Caritatis, an encyclical of Pope Leo XIII in which the pope urged Polish bishops to obey Russian authorities. Kudirka attacked the encyclical citing the example of the Kra≈æiai massacre in 1893 while Buƒçys defended it. He helped publish a Lithuanian translation of a collection of sermons by (published in 1894) and edited a translation of The Month of Mary by (published in 1900). He continued studies at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. He earned the Candidate of Philosophy degree for the thesis on the Pope Honorius I and Third Council of Constantinople in 1898 and Master's of Theology for the thesis on Saint Stanislaus of Szczepan√≥w in 1899. He was ordained as a priest on 25 March 1899. At the academy, B≈´ƒçys studied with Jurgis Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius starting their life-long friendship. He was also close with Lithuanian professors at the academy: he inherited property of Kazimieras Jaunius and wrote a 2,426-page biography of Justinas Pranaitis though it remains unpublished. He continued to contribute to Lithuanian press, including to Tƒóvynƒós sargas and ≈Ωinyƒçia. Together with Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius, he further studied apologetics under professor at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland using an assumed name because the Tsarist police allowed B≈´ƒçys to depart the Russian Empire for medical treatments, not for studies. In Fribourg, he joined the Lithuanian student society R≈´ta (rue). He was with Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius when he was operated for bone tuberculosis. To earn a living, Buƒçys held masses in Autigny and was chaplain of a girls' agricultural school in . He defended his expanded thesis on Saint Stanislaus, which was translated from Latin to Polish and published in 1902, and earned Doctor of Theology in July 1901. =Saint Petersburg and United States= Upon return to Lithuania in late 1901, B≈´ƒçys hoped to become an editor of a Lithuanian newspaper and live in Tilsit (present-day Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast). But bishop Antanas Baranauskas assigned him as a priest in his native Slavikai and as professor at the Sejny Priest Seminary before moving to the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy in August 1902. He taught apologetics and fundamental theology not only to the clerics at the academy but also to students at other universities. His students included Meƒçislovas Reinys, Mykolas Krupaviƒçius, Juozas Purickis, Vladas Jurgutis. In his memoirs, Buƒçys highlighted two weaknesses of his teaching methods ‚Äì he emphasized ability to think rather than knowledge of facts and spent too much time analyzing anti-religious arguments. In 1912, B≈´ƒçys became prorector of the Theological Academy. When rector Aleksander Kakowski became Archbishop of Warsaw, B≈´ƒçys was an acting rector from May 1913 to March 1915, but as a non-Pole was not officially confirmed as rector. Upon learning that he would not become rector, he resigned from the academy and briefly worked as a religion teacher at different schools and as a private tutor. In 1904, Buƒçys together with Maironis and Adomas Jak≈°tas wrote the program of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. In December 1905, during the Russian Revolution of 1905, B≈´ƒçys participated in the Great Seimas of Vilnius and became a member of its five-member presidium when Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas resigned in his favor. He did not chair a single session, but attempted to moderate extreme positions and opinions. He later faced criticism that before the end of World War I, he supported autonomy for Lithuania within the Russian Empire and not full independence. In Saint Petersburg, Buƒçys contributed articles to Lithuanian (he had his own sections in ≈†altinis and Vadovas, Vilniaus ≈æinios, Lietuvi≈≥ laikra≈°tis, Nedƒóldienio skaitymas, Draugija, Viltis, Vienybƒó), Polish (PrzeglƒÖd Katolicki, Wiadomo≈õci Archidiecezjalne, Wiadomo≈õci Ko≈õcielne, Atenaum Kap≈Ça≈Ñskie), Belgian (Le Messager du Sacr√©-Coeur de J√©sus), and American (New World in Chicago) press. He supported seven different Lithuanian societies and organizations in Saint Petersburg. Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius joined him as a professor at the academy in 1907. They often discussed reviving the Congregation of Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception which at the time had only one elderly member, but it had to be done in secret due to various Russification policies. On 29 August 1909, in a private chapel of auxiliary bishop at the clergy house of the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw, Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius became a member of the Marian Fathers and B≈´ƒçys began his novitiate. In 1910, he refused an offer to become suffragan bishop of Samogitia. During World War I, B≈´ƒçys served as a priest and teacher to a Lithuanian refugee community in the Izmaylovo District near Moscow. In August 1916, Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius as Superior-General of the Marian Fathers, sent B≈´ƒçys to Chicago, Illinois where Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius personally established the first house of the Marian Fathers in August 1913. He traveled via Finland, Sweden, Norway, UK, and France to Naples in Italy where he boarded a ship on 16 October. He reached Brooklyn on 3 November 1916. He received 70,000 rubles from the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers for the journey and was tasked with petitioning Pope Benedict XV to declare the Lithuanian Day, an international fundraising drive for the benefit of war refugees. Buƒçys was refused, but priest Konstantinas Ol≈°auskas later managed to get the approval. In United States, Buƒçys served as the pastor of Lithuanian parishes in Sheboygan, Wisconsin (August 1917 ‚Äì May 1918) and Waukegan, Illinois (June 1918 ‚Äì July 1921). From December 1918, he was also chaplain of the monastery of the Sisters of Saint Casimir and religion teacher at their school. At the same time, he edited the struggling Lithuanian daily Draugas (in February‚ÄìJuly 1917 and September 1918 ‚Äì July 1920) and in 1920 established religious weekly Laivas which continued to be published by the Marian Fathers in Chicago until 1990. He was also a member of the commission that collected a million signatures under a petition to President Warren G. Harding to recognize independent Lithuania. =Independent Lithuania= In July 1921, B≈´ƒçys returned to Lithuania. From 1921 to 1923, he was rector of the Church of St. Gertrude in Kaunas, which was transferred to the Marian Fathers in February 1922. B≈´ƒçys worked on establishing the Faculty of Theology at the newly organized University of Lithuania. He drafted the plan for the faculty and traveled to Rome to have it approved by the Congregation for Catholic Education. He also worked on the university statute. When the university was officially opened in February 1922, B≈´ƒçys became professor of the fundamental theology. He was dean of the Faculty of Theology (April 1922 ‚Äì August 1923), university prorector (September 1923 ‚Äì September 1924), rector (September 1924 ‚Äì September 1925), and again dean of the Faculty of Theology (September 1925 ‚Äì September 1926). He helped in organizing and was a board member of the Lithuanian Catholic Academy of Science (he attempted to establish the academy in 1907, but it was organized only in 1922). He organized the transfer of funds raised for a Catholic university to the new academy. He became a true academic member of the academy in 1936. In 1922, he proposed to build a church in ≈Ωaliakalnis neighborhood of Kaunas as a monument to Lithuania's independence. The idea was supported by Juozas Tumas- Vai≈ægantas, bishop Juozapas Skvireckas, and others and the construction of the Christ's Resurrection Church started in 1934. He continued to contribute articles to the press: he edited daily Laisvƒó (Freedom) in 1921 and published articles in Rytas, Lietuva, ≈†altinis, Tiesos Kelias, Kosmos. In recognition of his contributions, he was awarded the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (2nd class) in 1928. From 1923, B≈´ƒçys was deputy of Matulaitis- Matuleviƒçius, Superior-General of the Marian Fathers. When Matulaitis- Matuleviƒçius resigned as bishop and was tasked with the negotiation of the Concordat with Lithuania, Buƒçys was his secretary. In 1926, Buƒçys accompanied Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius to United States to the 28th International Eucharistic Congress. At the same time, they consecrated a Lithuanian church in Cicero, Illinois, and visited the St Casimir's Lithuanian Church in London. Buƒçys administered the last rites to Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius before he died of appendicitis in January 1927. B≈´ƒçys was elected the new Superior-General in December 1927. In September 1928, he resigned from the university and relocated to Rome. During his tenure as Superior-General until 1933, the Marian Fathers continued to grow and strengthen. The number of members reached 431. New houses were established in Panevƒó≈æys, ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ Kalvarija, Rƒìzekne (Latvia), Washington D.C., and Thompson, Connecticut. B≈´ƒçys worked to formalize statute, rules, and regulations of the congregation. He represented Lithuania and was elected as honorary member to the committees at the international Eucharistic congresses in Sydney, Australia (1928), Carthage, Tunisia (1930), and Dublin, Ireland (1932). =Eastern Catholic mission= Before his death, Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius considered a Catholic mission into Russia. It was supported and encouraged by the Vatican in hopes that respecting and leaving the traditional Byzantine customs would allow implementing Catholic dogma and teaching among Eastern Orthodoxs. After the death of Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius, B≈´ƒçys continued to plan the mission. The mission by Michel d'Herbigny proved that a Catholic mission into the Soviet Union was impossible, and the attention was shifted to Russian diaspora. Bishop (also a member of the Marian Fathers), papal internuncio Riccardo Bartoloni, and Prime Minister Augustinas Voldemaras agreed on the mission in Lithuania and the use of the St. Michael the Archangel Church for its purposes. While Lithuanian priests resisted learning Eastern rites and Lithuanian diplomats reconsidered their support due to possible negative effects on relations with Russia, Buƒçys continued with the mission. From 1929, B≈´ƒçys was an advisory member of the pontifical commission on Russia. On 6 July 1930, he was consecrated as titular bishop of Olympos by bishop Cyril Kurtev, Apostolic Exarch of the Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Sofia, at the Church of San Clemente al Laterano. According to traditions, Buƒçys adopted a new name and chose Petras (Peter). He visited Russian communities in eight countries (including France, Belgium, Yugoslavia) in 1930 and Marian Fathers in United States in 1931. In 1932 and 1933, he visited United States organizing Catholic missions among the Russian immigrants. The Marian Fathers reelected him as their Superior-General in 1933, but the pope would not confirm the results and Buƒçys was forced to resign. He returned to Lithuania in June 1934 for the first Lithuanian Eucharistic Congress in Kaunas. He had a round-trip ticket and was expecting to return to United States, but received orders from the Vatican to remain in Lithuania and work among local Russians. In October 1934, he held Eastern rite masses at the Church of St. Francis Xavier that attracted attention from Orthodox intelligentsia who were dissatisfied with the services of Metropolitan . He held additional Eastern Catholic masses at the Church of St. Gertrude but the interest quickly waned. He asked to be reassigned to United States, but was refused. In 1935‚Äì1936, he was the spiritual father of the Tel≈°iai Priest Seminary. At the same time he visited various villages with larger populations of Eastern Orthodox and Old Believers, wrote articles to the press, including an academic study on the history and demographics of Eastern Orthodox and Old Believers in Lithuania, and published a book of popular readings for the faithful. In November 1936, both Buƒçys and the Marian Fathers petitioned Pope Pius XI to reassign Buƒçys to work for the Marian Fathers. The pope refused and appointed Buƒçys as the head of the new papal Mission for Spiritual Assistance for the Russians of Lithuania established by the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. He returned to Kaunas in summer 1937 and held Eastern rite masses at the St. Michael the Archangel Church. He had two to four assistants. They held lectures on the need to eliminate the East‚ÄìWest Schism, tried to convert local Eastern Orthodox priests, published religious literature, but failed to convert a single more prominent member of the intelligentsia or the clergy or establish a single parish. They tried to expand the mission to Latvia, but were blocked from entering the country. Buƒçys was disappointed and disillusioned with the mission as many prospective converts had some ulterior motives (e.g. financial gain). After the death of Pope Pius XI in February 1939, Buƒçys was reelected as the Superior-General of the Marian Fathers in July 1939 and finally allowed to leave for Rome. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940, he organized Lithuanian-language broadcast on the Vatican Radio and presented its first program on 27 November 1940. He continued to present until spring 1941. Buƒçys supervised missions of Marian Fathers in London and Harbin that continued to spread Eastern Catholicism and prepared a breviary suitable for those missions. He visited the Marian fathers in Argentina, North America, United Kingdom in 1949. He continued to lead the congregation until his resignation due to poor health in March 1951. He suffered a brain hemorrhage in September 1951 and a day before his death received permission to hold Latin rite masses. He died in October 1951 in Rome and was buried at the Campo Verano. Works In addition to some 600 articles published in more than 30 periodicals, B≈´ƒçys published a number of separate books on various topics. He published a collection of his articles as separate books Tikƒójimo dalykai in 1913 and Gyvenimo pagrindas in 1931. His most important work is a three-volume theological work aimed at an average priest and school graduate. The three volumes on God the Creator, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit were published in 1929‚Äì1932. His popular works include books about the Lourdes apparitions (first published in 1909, third edition in 1943), cautionary tales promoting the temperance movement (in 1925 and 1939), parents' right and obligation to raise and educate their children (in 1927), a conversation about the soul (in 1930). He also published guides for priests (collection of sermons in 1936, spiritual exercises in 1925), theology textbooks (brief apologetics in 1922, 1923, and 1926, on fundamental theology in 1923 and 1926, on theological encyclopedia in 1925), historical and demographic study on the Eastern Orthodox and Old Believers in Lithuania (in 1936), an essay on education arguing that the state should only finance schools that should be run by communities and organizations in 1918, a report on the 29th Eucharistic congress in 1929, a review of a book on ethics by Adomas Jak≈°tas (Su Jak≈°tu per pikto laukus in 1937), a work of fiction (Rapukus kaupiant in 1928), and others. He wrote six notebooks (396 pages) worth of memoirs and published excerpts in Tƒóvynƒós sargas; they were published posthumously in 1966. He left other thick volumes of manuscripts on his thoughts for the Marian Fathers, on good behavior, and miracles of Jesus as well as an extensive biography of Justinas Pranaitis. Buƒçys was one of four most prominent Lithuanian apologists of the time (others were Adomas Jak≈°tas, Justinas Staugaitis, and Pranas Dovydaitis). The public discussion of apologetics peaked in the Lithuanian press around 1910‚Äì1915. In his writings, Buƒçys was rather soft and polite. Most frequently he used arguments based on history and natural science. He avoided dry theory and searched for a more practical approach and real-life examples. He had a good memory and knew more than ten languages (he could write rather fluently in six of them ‚Äì Lithuanian, Latin, Polish, Russian, French, and English).

Vitale, and Simmons, based on an idea by Chuck Wendig and Sam Sykes. The film stars Fran Kranz and Alyson Hannigan, and features Brittany S. Hall, Patrick Reginald Walker, Keith David, and Bryan Price in supporting roles. Plot While in a panicked state at Camp Clear Vista, lead counselor (and camp owner) Sam calls his friend Chuck (short for \\"Charlotte\\"), a horror movie enthusiast working at a comic book store. Sam explains that a masked murderer is loose on the campgrounds and has killed \\"a lot\\" of counselors. Chuck asks Sam for more details. Sam begins recounting his first day at the camp with fellow counselors including Carol, Ted, Steve ‚ÄòThe Kayak King,‚Äô Drew, Alice and Heather, Sam's ex- girlfriend Imani, Freddie, Nancy, Brad, and Jamie. Sam suffers a momentary blackout while on the phone with Chuck. Sam escapes the cabin where he is hiding when someone sets it on fire. Sam briefly encounters the masked killer before finding a new hiding spot. Chuck calls back to help Sam deduce the killer's identity. Sam recalls how he and several other counselors found themselves trapped at the camp after discovering several dead bodies. A flashback shows Sam stumbling upon Freddie and Nancy while patrolling the woods for the killer. For some reason Freddie and Nancy are unable to hear Sam. Sam begins suffering a blackout as he witnesses the killer slaughtering them. Sam and Chuck eventually conclude that because he is covered in blood, holding the killer's signature blade, and possesses a mysterious wooden mask, Sam may actually be the killer and his blackouts prevented him from remembering. Sam tries to destroy the mask, but discovers it is unbreakable. He then attempts to burn the mask, only for his face to burn as well. Chuck theorizes that the mask may have imprinted on him. Fearful that the surviving counselors are going to kill him, Sam goes back into hiding. Chuck asks Sam to remember how everything started. Sam flashes back to killing skinny-dippers at a pool, a couple in a kitchen, and then his friend, Steve \\"The Kayak King,\\" while possessed by the mask. Sam recalls telling Camp Clear Vista's haunted history to other counselors around a campfire. Sam tells the tale of a woodcarver who crafted a mask from a tree where a dark spirit was trapped a century earlier by a Cajun medicine man. The mask compelled the carver to kill his family and others in the village until a young woman kills him to stop the killings. Now the cursed mask is rumored to be buried at the woodcarver's grave. Despite Sam's warning that the story is true, the counselors go off to look for the mask. Drew manipulates Sam into inadvertently revealing where the woodcarver's grave is. Drew discovers the mask buried by the headstone. Sam convinces Drew to not wear the mask, so she puts it on Sam instead as a joke. Sam then becomes possessed by it, recovers the woodcarver's hidden weapon (a ceremonial-looking jagged blade, made from a gator jaw), and kills Drew. Sam continues flashing back to the other murders he unknowingly committed while wearing the mask. Sam remembers choking out Imani before throwing her into a spike pit as his most recent kill. Sam's feelings for Imani allows him to take off the mask. With Chuck fully caught up, she advises Sam to be aware of Jamie because she appears to be the Final Girl. Sam tries to fight it, but a supernatural compulsion causes Sam to don the mask again and kill Brad. Imani emerges from the spike pit, having faked her death, to regroup with Jamie. The two manage to knock the mask off Sam and lock him in a shed. Sam tries explaining that the mask made him kill. Sam also expresses that he believes that if both Imani and Jamie stay alive, all three of them could be safe since there won't be a face off with the Final Girl. Over the phone, Chuck explains the Final Girl concept to the two remaining women. While Chuck warns them to keep Sam away from the mask, Sam is compelled to wear it once more. Sam breaks out of the shed, prompting Imani and Jamie to run. Thinking she will survive if she becomes the Final Girl, Imani tries to kill Jamie. However, Jamie kills Imani instead. Over the phone, Chuck tells Jamie that she now needs to kill Sam at the woodcarver's grave because it is the place of power. Sam manages to tear off the mask and head to the gravesite himself‚Äîhe has a plan. After telling his plan to Chuck, Sam convinces Jamie that they both can survive if they stop the curse by burying the mask. Jamie digs a hole at the burial site. However, Jamie becomes compelled to don the mask when she touches it. Jamie stabs Sam with the woodcarver's blade, and he falls over dead. With the mask removed, Jamie tells Chuck over the phone that the ordeal is over. She then walks off, taking the mask with her. Two years later Chuck receives a call from a panicked Sam, having become undead. Cast * Fran Kranz as Sam Wescott * Alyson Hannigan as Chuck * Brittany S.

The museum's exhibitions are drawn from a collection of about 1,300 works from post-World War II artists around the world. It is the largest private contemporary art museum in the United States, and is noted for its setting in a broad natural landscape. The museum was developed and financed by billionaire American businessman Mitchell Rales, and is curated by Emily Wei Rales. Artists in Glenstone's collection are required to have already been exhibited for at least 15 years. First opened in 2006 in a building designed by Charles Gwathmey, the museum has been expanded several times between 2013 and 2018 on its campus. Its largest expansion was opened to the public on October 4, 2018, with outdoor sculpture installations, landscaping, and the introduction of a new museum complex called the Pavilions designed by Thomas Phifer. In 2019, Glenstone added an environmental center with exhibits on recycling, composting, and reforestation. Glenstone has been compared to other private museums such as the Frick Collection and The Phillips Collection, and has received generally positive reviews in the press. The museum is open, free to the public, via online booking.  History  In 1986, billionaire American businessman Mitchell Rales purchased property in Potomac, Maryland, in order to build a home. Starting in 1990 Rales began collecting art for that home. Following a near-death accident on a helicopter trip in Russia, Rales decided to take on a philanthropic project, which became the establishment of a private contemporary art museum. Built on land that was formerly a fox hunting club, Glenstone is named for the nearby Glen Road, and because of stone quarries located in the vicinity. Located from downtown Washington, D.C., the museum's initial Modernist limestone gallery opened in 2006, and admitted visitors two days a week. In its first seven years, the museum admitted only 10,000 visitors.alt=Though several smaller expansions took place in the years after the museum's opening, the largest expansion was announced in 2013 and was completed in 2018, opening to the public on October 4, 2018\\\\. With a cost of approximately $219 million, the expansion increased the size of the museum's gallery space by a factor of five, increased the size of the property by , and included substantial landscaping changes. With the expansion, Glenstone became the largest private contemporary art museum in the United States. In 2019, the expansion was named as a \\"Museum Opening of the Year\\" by Apollo. With the expansion, Glenstone opened to the public, with free tickets available online. In the year following the expansion, Glenstone admitted nearly 100,000 visitors. After 2018, Glenstone continued to acquire adjacent properties, including lots containing residential homes. Speaking on Public Radio Tulsa's Museum Confidential program in 2019, curator Emily Wei Rales said that future plans do not include substantial expansion, and will likely be limited to \\"one or two smaller buildings to house artworks, maybe in the woods, maybe on an adjoining property\\". She also mentioned potential plans to build a conservation lab on the campus. To encourage the usage of public transportation, Glenstone successfully lobbied Montgomery County to add a bus stop near its campus. The museum admits visitors without tickets who arrive on public buses.  Collection and exhibitions  Split-Rocker (2000) by Jeff Koons The museum's collection of about 1,300 post-World War II works from around the world consists of paintings, single-artist installations, video installations, sound installations, and both indoor and outdoor sculptures, totaling $1.4 billion in assets. The collection contains only works by artists who have already exhibited for at least 15 years. As a private art museum, Glenstone has been compared to the Frick Collection and The Phillips Collection. Many of the museum's large galleries feature only one or two pieces, do not contain explanatory text, and are sparsely furnished. While some exhibitions are permanent, the collection rotates through the galleries over time. Pieces from the collection are also loaned to public institutions both domestically and internationally. Glenstone limits entry to about 450 visitors per day. According to Rales, the limit is imposed to \\"give lots of space to our visitors, to really give them the time to explore and enjoy\\". Rales wrote that she used a formula to calculate the optimal number of visitors for the museum's size. The museum's staff is made up of recent university graduates, including some in postgraduate programs, through its Emerging Professionals Program, a two-year program for aspiring curators. Staff members are stationed in the galleries to answer questions from visitors about the art. Tony Smithalt= In 2018, the introduction of the Pavilions expansion debuted single-artist installations and exhibitions from artists Cy Twombly, Robert Gober, Pipilotti Rist, Charles Ray, On Kawara, Martin Puryear, Michael Heizer, Lygia Pape, Brice Marden. Other artists who have been on display at Glenstone have included Roni Horn, Alexander Calder, Ruth Asawa, David Hammons, Alighiero Boetti, Kerry James Marshall, Shirin Neshat, Rirkrit Tiravanija, and Mark Rothko.Horse and rider (2014) by Charles Ray  Architecture  Glenstone is noted for its peaceful natural setting, consisting of a cluster of galleries and other buildings set in a large wooded campus. The museum buildings are located toward the center of the campus, and visitors approach the galleries from gravel parking lots via a pathway through the property that is about long. In designing the campus, Glenstone's founders made an effort to establish a tranquil experience, leading them and art critics to refer to the museum as part of the \\"slow art\\" movement. = Buildings = The original Glenstone building opened in 2006 and was designed by American architect Charles Gwathmey of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects. The building is a modernist limestone structure with of gallery space, located on of land. The 2018 expansion added of gallery space in a museum structure called the Pavilions, designed by American architect Thomas Phifer. Mitchell and Emily Wei Rales have mentioned several buildings as particular influences on the design: the Ryoan-ji Zen temple in Kyoto, Japan; the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas; the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, Switzerland; and the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark. The Pavilions is built of precast concrete blocks that were poured during different seasons to produce variable coloring. Though it is one building, the Pavilions is meant to appear as multiple separate buildings from a distance. The structure contains eleven galleries connected by glass-enclosed walkways, with windows made of panels of glass. The galleries make heavy use of natural light through clerestories, oculi, and skylights. Regarding the architectural approach to the Pavilions, Emily Rales said, \\"we knew we wanted these discrete spaces where you could essentially enter into another world that happens to be an art installation\\". Glenstone's 2018 expansion was a \\"critic's choice\\" in The Wall Street Journal's review of the best architecture of 2018, with Julie V. Iovine writing that Glenstone's architecture takes an approach \\"that offers a sequence of events revealed gradually with constantly shifting perspectives, as opposed to classic modernism‚Äôs tightly controlled image of architecture as geometric tableau\\". In 2020, the expansion was a winner of the American Institute of Architect's Architecture Awards. In 2019, Glenstone opened a environmental center on its campus. The building contains self-guided exhibits about recycling, composting, and reforestation.

The Water Court's design was inspired by the reflecting pool at the Brion Cemetery in northern Italy. Referring to the way the museum returns visitors to the Water Court, Samuel Medina wrote for Metropolis, \\"Art isn't the heart of the Glenstone Museum, which opened in October  water is\\". Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Sebastian Smee wrote of the Water Court: > It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôve entered a beautiful sanctuary, possibly in another > hemisphere, maybe another era. Although you‚Äôve descended, you actually feel > a kind of lift, a buoyancy, such as what birds must feel when they catch > warm air currents. You exhale. You feel liberated from everyday cares. > You‚Äôre ready for the art. The expansion also added of land to the campus, a landscape largely composed of woodland and wildflower meadows. The landscaping was designed by landscape architect Peter Walker's firm PWP Landscape Architecture. The effort included the planting of about 8,000 trees, the transplanting of 200 trees, the converting lawn areas to meadows, and the restoration of streams that flowed through the campus. Glenstone's landscaping is managed using organic products only. This outdoor space hosts large art installations by artists including Jeff Koons, F√©lix Gonzalez-Torres, Michael Heizer, and Richard Serra.  Reception  Untitled (2005) by alt= In a review for The Washington Post in 2018, Philip Kennicott wrote that Glenstone is a \\"must-see\\" museum and that its creators successfully \\"integrate art, architecture, and landscape\\". Referring to the natural setting of the museum, he wrote that \\"everything is quietly spectacular, with curated views to the outdoors that present nature as visual haiku\\". Kennicott tempered his review by mentioning that the museum's distinctive architecture and layout continually confront visitors with \\"strange visions\\" that will make it \\"interesting to see how it is received\\". Kriston Capps of Washington City Paper called Glenstone's 2018 expansion successful and enchanting, with a sublime viewing experience. He wrote that the museum's collection excels in its focus around conventional paintings, sculptures, and installations, but excludes more modern media, such as video or performance art. With respect to this conservative focus, Capps wrote, \\"Glenstone is not promoting equity, addressing inequality, or solving accessibility ‚Äî not yet anyhow.\\" In Washingtonian, Dan Reed praised Glenstone's suburban setting, saying it \\"has little in common with the crowded downtown art meccas\\", and describing it as soothing, contemplative, and stunningly landscaped. Writing for the National Review, Brian T. Allen described Glenstone as \\"a gift to the public of rare size and consequence\\" and wrote that it \\"is a huge success on many levels, but among its triumphs is fashioning a mood and space to look intently and even to fall in love with art that most will be disposed to find difficult, forbidding, or inscrutable.\\" Regarding the landscape, Allen wrote, \\"Getting people out of their cars for the long walk to the exhibition spaces creates a time of orientation and decompression. Few museums can even try this because they don‚Äôt have the land.\\" Sebastian Smee wrote in The Washington Post about Glenstone's potential to appeal to some types of visitors, but not others. Calling it \\"the most exciting new private museum in America\\", Smee wrote that for some visitors, \\"the Glenstone experience can feel, at least initially, a little weird. A little too...controlling.\\" He went on to say that the museum \\"wants you to have your own experience\\" and \\"proposes that art should not be glibly explained away by wall labels but experienced and reflected upon.\\" Also in The Washington Post, Kelsey Ables wrote, \\"With a vibe somewhere between a luxury spa and a futuristic hospital, Glenstone is soothing to some, dystopian to others.\\" In Artnet News, Julia Halperin complimented the diversity of Glenstone's exhibited artists, writing that \\"they have seamlessly integrated into the typically male, overwhelmingly white Modern art canon superb work by women, Asian (particularly Japanese) artists, and Latin American (particularly Brazilian) artists,\\" but also wrote that it \\"offers comparatively little work by black, Latinx, and Native American artists.\\" The Washington Post's dance critic, Sarah L. Kaufman, wrote that Glenstone exhibits many visual works that are relevant and influential to dance, including works by Pipilotti Rist, Jasper Johns, and Sol LeWitt.  Legal dispute  In August 2018, Glenstone Foundation Inc., the foundation that manages the museum, was sued by HITT Contracting, the company that managed the construction of the 2018 expansion, for $24 million to cover cost overruns. In October 2018, Glenstone countersued HITT Contracting for $35.9 million, claiming that the project was over budget and that construction issues had delayed the expansion's opening.

The agreement has been characterized as \\"NAFTA 2.0,\\" or \\"New NAFTA,\\" since many provisions from NAFTA were incorporated and its changes were seen as largely incremental. On July 1, 2020, the USMCA entered into force in all member states. The Agreement is the result of a 2017‚Äì2018 renegotiation between the member states of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which informally agreed to the terms of the new agreement on September 30, 2018 and formally on October 1. The USMCA was proposed by United States President Donald Trump and was signed by Trump, Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on November 30, 2018, as a side event of the 2018 G20 Summit in Buenos Aires. A revised version was signed on December 10, 2019, and was ratified by all three countries, with the final ratification (Canada) occurring on March 13, 2020 immediately before the Parliament of Canada adjourned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Negotiations \\"focused largely on auto exports, steel and aluminum tariffs, and the dairy, egg, and poultry markets.\\" One provision \\"prevents any party from passing laws that restrict the cross-border flow of data\\". Compared to NAFTA, USMCA increases environmental and working regulations, and incentivizes more domestic production of cars and trucks. url= The agreement also provides updated intellectual property protections, gives the United States more access to Canada's dairy market, imposes a quota for Canadian and Mexican automotive production, and increases the duty-free limit for Canadians who buy U.S. goods online from 20 to 150. The full list of differences between USMCA and NAFTA is listed on the website of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), Robert Lighthizer. In addition to provisions from the original NAFTA, the USMCA borrows heavily from the Trans- Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade agreements. On April 3, 2020, Mexico announced it was ready to implement the agreement, joining Canada.CBC News, \\"Mexico joins Canada, notifies U.S. it's ready to implement new NAFTA\\" 2020/04/04 accessed 06 April 2020 The agreement came into effect on July 1, 2020.  Background and nomenclature The United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement is based on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which originally came into effect on January 1, 1994. The present agreement was the result of more than a year of negotiations including possible tariffs by the United States against Canada in addition to the possibility of separate bilateral deals instead. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump's campaign included the promise to renegotiate NAFTA, or cancel it if re-negotiations were to fail. Upon election, Trump proceeded to make a number of changes affecting trade relations with other countries. Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, ceasing to be part of negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and significantly increasing tariffs with China were some of the steps he implemented, reinforcing that he was serious about seeking changes to NAFTA. Much of the debate surrounding the virtues and faults of the USMCA is similar to that surrounding all free trade agreements (FTAs), for instance, the nature of FTA's as public goods, potential infringements of national sovereignty, and the role of business, labor, environmental, and consumer interests in shaping the language of trade deals. The agreement is referred to differently by each signatory‚Äîin the United States, it is called the United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement (USMCA); in Canada, it is officially known as the Canada‚ÄìUnited States‚ÄìMexico Agreement (CUSMA) in English and the ' (ACEUM) in French; and in Mexico, it is called ' (T-MEC). The agreement is sometimes referred to as \\"New NAFTA\\" in reference to the previous trilateral agreement it is meant to supersede, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  Uniform Regulations  On June 1, 2020 the USTR Robert Lighthizer's office released the uniform regulations, which is the last hurdle before implementing the agreement on July 1, 2020. As per section 103(b)(2) of the USMCA Act, the date for the required interim regulations to be recommended will be no later than when the USMCA takes effect and the Uniform Regulations regarding Rules of Origin are implemented. The Uniform Regulations in the USMCA help interpret the different chapters of the USMCA, primarily chapters 4-7. These regulations were released 1 month before the trade deal took effect, replacing NAFTA on July 1, 2020.  Negotiations  A visualization of the timeline for the USMCA ratification process in the US, as prescribed by Trade Promotion Authority The formal negotiation process began on May 18, 2017, when the USTR notified Congress that he intended to renegotiate NAFTA starting in 90 days. In accordance with Trade Promotion Authority statutes, the USTR released its key negotiating objectives document on July 7, 2017. Negotiations began on August 16, 2017, and continued with eight formal rounds of talks until April 8, 2018. Lacking any resolution, Lighthizer stated on May 2, 2018, that if the end of the month reached no deal, negotiations would be halted until 2019. This statement was motivated by the pending change of government in Mexico, in which the then-incoming President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, disagreed with much of the negotiated language and might be unwilling to sign the deal. Separately, on May 11, 2018, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan set May 17 as a deadline for Congressional action. This deadline was disregarded and the deal with Mexico was not reached until August 27, 2018. At this time Canada had not agreed to the presented deal. Because Mexico's outgoing president, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, left office on December 1, 2018, and 60 days are required as a review period, the deadline for providing the agreed text was the end of September 30, 2018. which was reached precisely on September 30. Negotiators worked around the clock and completed the agreement less than an hour before midnight of that date on a draft text. The next day on October 1, 2018, the USMCA text was published as an agreed-to document. The agreed text of the agreement was signed by leaders of all three countries on November 30, 2018 as a side event to the 2018 G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The English, the Spanish and French versions will be equally authentic, and the agreement will take effect after ratification from all three states through the passage of enabling legislation. It was revealed in a memoir published by Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO and founder of American LBO specialist The Blackstone Group, that he had incited Justin Trudeau to concede the protected dairy market in the USMCA negotiations. According to Schwarzman, Trudeau feared that a recession would impact his government's prospects during the 2019 Canadian federal election. The executive, who had been retained by Trump, also was invited in January 2017 to address the Liberal Cabinet at a Calgary retreat when the Cabinet would be unprotected by its Privy Council Office civil servants. Then, as the negotiations reached their end come 1 October 2018, at a last-minute behind-the-scenes meeting at the United Nations in New York, Trudeau sacrificed the dairy industry to save the media industry and the automotive exemption. Chrystia Freeland, the Foreign Affairs minister from Trinity-Spadina riding in downtown Toronto whose constituents include many staff of the CBC and The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star and the Toronto Sun, maps \\"Canadian culture\\" directly onto the media industry. Robert Fife in an election cycle article failed to obtain any comment from other than the Liberal party. Fox News reported on December 9, 2019, that negotiators from the three countries reached an agreement on enforcement, paving the way for a final deal within 24 hours and ratification by all three parties before the end of the year. Mexico has agreed to the enforcement of a minimum wage of US$16/hour for Mexican automotive workers by a \\"neutral\\" third party. Mexico, which imports all of its aluminum, has also expressed opposition to provisions regarding American steel and aluminum contents in automobile components.USMCA trade agreement reached Edward Lawrence & Jonathan Garber, FOX Business, Dec 9, 2019,  Provisions  Provisions of the agreement cover a wide range, including agricultural produce, homelessness, manufactured products, labor conditions, digital trade, among others. Some of the more prominent aspects of the agreement include giving US dairy farmers greater access to the Canadian market, guidelines to have a higher proportion of automobiles manufactured amongst the three nations rather than imported from elsewhere, and retention of the dispute resolution system similar to that included in NAFTA. = Dairy = The dairy provisions give the U.S. tariff-free access to 3.6%, up from 3.25% under the never-ratified Trans-Pacific Partnership, of the $15.2 billion (as of 2016) Canadian dairy market. Canada agreed to eliminate Class 7 pricing provisions on certain dairy products, while Canada's domestic supply management system remains in place. Canada agreed to raise the duty-free limit on purchases from the U.S. to $150 from the previous $20 level, allowing Canadian consumers to have greater duty-free access to the U.S market. = Automobiles = Automobile rules of origin (ROO) requirements mandate that a certain portion of an automobile's value must come from within the governed region. In NAFTA, the required portion was 62.5 percent. The USMCA increases this requirement by 12.5 percentage points, to 75 percent of the automobile's value. The initial proposal from the Trump administration was an increase to 85 percent, and an added stipulation that 50 percent of the automotive content be made by United States auto manufacturers. While the deal's text did not include the more demanding version of this provision, there is concern that the increased domestic sourcing, aimed at promoting US employment, will come with higher input costs and disruptions to existing supply chains. = De Minimis = To facilitate greater cross-border trade, the United States has reached an agreement with Mexico and Canada to raise its de minimis shipment value levels. Canada will raise its de minimis level for the first time in decades, from C$20 (US$) to C$40 (US$) for taxes. Canada will also provide for duty-free shipments up to C$150 (US$). Mexico will continue to provide US$50 tax-free de minimis and also provide duty-free shipments up to the equivalent level of US$117. Shipment values up to these levels would enter with minimal formal entry procedures, making it easier for more businesses, especially small- and medium-sized ones, to be a part of cross-border trade. Canada will also allow 90 days after entry for the importer to make payment of taxes. = Labor = US Vice President Mike Pence speaks about the USMCA at a Uline distribution center in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin in 2019 USMCA Annex 23-A requires Mexico to pass legislation that improves the collective bargaining capabilities of labor unions. The specific standards Mexico is required to comply with are detailed in the International Labour Organization's Convention 98 on freedom of association and collective bargaining. The administration of Mexico's president, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, introduced legislation in late 2018 which pursues compliance with these international standards. Other labor-related measures include a minimum wage requirement in the automotive industry. Specifically, 40 to 45 percent of the automobiles manufactured in North America must be made in a factory that pays a minimum of $16 per hour. This measure will be phased in during the first five years after USMCA ratification. = Intellectual Property = The USMCA will extend the copyright length in Canada to life plus 70 years, and 75 years for sound recordings. This extension mirrors the same IP policy captured in the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, paragraph 18.63. Furthermore, biotechnological firms would have at least 10 years exclusivity period for agricultural chemicals (double the current 5), and industrial designs' period would \\"jump\\" from current 10 to 15 years. Compared to NAFTA, USMCA would: Require criminal penalties and civil remedies be available for both satellite and cable theft, reaffirms Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, contains the strongest due process and transparency requirements for Geographic Indicator protection systems in any FTA, requires criminal procedures and penalties for recording copyrighted movies in movie theaters, and requires ex officio authority for customs officials to stop suspected counterfeit goods. =Elimination of Foreign Office and Local Presence requirements = The USMCA sunset clause would eliminate the need for companies to establish headquarters in any other USMCA country. It will encourage cross-border business by excluding US companies from the need to localize data, open a Canadian or Mexican HQ. For example, McDonald's Canada or Apple Canada would both cease to exist and the surviving entities would be a North American McDonald's or Apple. = Dispute Settlement Mechanisms = There are three primary dispute settlement mechanisms contained in NAFTA. Chapter 20 is the country-to-country resolution mechanism. It is often regarded as the least contentious of the three mechanisms, and it was sustained in its original NAFTA form in USMCA. Such cases would involve complaints between USMCA member states that a term of the agreement had been violated. Chapter 19 disputes manage the justifications of anti-dumping or countervailing duties. Without Chapter 19, the legal recourse for managing these policies would be through the domestic legal system. Chapter 19 specifies that a USMCA Panel will hear the case and act as an International Trade Court in arbitrating the dispute. The Trump administration attempted to remove Chapter 19 from the new USMCA text, though it has thus far endured in the agreement. Chapter 11 is the third mechanism, known as investor-state dispute settlement, wherein multinational corporations are enabled to sue participating governments over allegedly discriminatory policies. Chapter 11 is broadly considered the most controversial of the settlement mechanisms. The Canadian negotiators effectively removed themselves from Chapter 11 in the USMCA version of this measure, Chapter 14. Canada will have a full exemption from ISDS three years after NAFTA has been terminated. = Beyond The Border Accord = In addition to building on the existing NAFTA fused with elements from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the new USMCA just passed by the US Congress also incorporates elements from the \\"Beyond the Border\\" accord signed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and former President Barack Obama, most notably the \\"single window\\" initiative and folding the \\"Regulatory Cooperation Council\\" into the \\"Good Regulatory Governance\\" chapter 28 of the new accord. = Sunset clause = Additionally, there is a stipulation that the agreement itself must be reviewed by the three nations every six years, with a 16-year sunset clause. The agreement can be extended for additional 16-year terms during the six-year reviews. The introduction of the sunset clause places more control in shaping the future of the USMCA in the hands of domestic governments. However, there is concern that this can create greater uncertainty. Sectors such as automotive manufacturing require significant investment in cross-border supply chains. Given the dominance of the United States consumer market, this will likely pressure firms to locate more production in the US, with a greater likelihood of increased production costs for those vehicles. = Currency = A new addition in the USMCA is the inclusion of Chapter 33 which covers Macroeconomic Policies and Exchange Rate Matters. This is considered significant because it could set a precedent for future trade agreements. Chapter 33 establishes requirements for currency and macroeconomic transparency which, if violated, would constitute grounds for a Chapter 20 dispute appeal. The US, Canada, and Mexico are all currently in compliance with these transparency requirements in addition to the substantive policy requirements which align with the International Monetary Fund Articles of Agreement. = Clause 32.10 = The USMCA will impact how member countries negotiate future free trade deals. Article 32.10 requires USMCA countries to notify USMCA members three months in advance if they intend to begin free trade negotiations with non-market economies. Article 32.10 permits USMCA countries the ability to review any new free trade deals members agree to go forward. Article 32.10 is widely speculated to be targeting China in intent. In fact, a senior White House official said in connection to the USMCA deal that \\"We have been very concerned about the efforts of China to essentially undermine the US position by entering into arrangements with others.\\" = Against exchange rate manipulation = The USMCA countries are to abide IMF standards aimed to prevent the manipulation of exchange rates. The agreement calls for public disclosure of market interventions. The IMF can be summoned to act as a referee if the parties dispute. = Against State-Owned Enterprises = State-owned enterprises, which are favored by China as levers for exercising its dominance, are somehow prevented from receiving unfair subsidies when compared to private enterprise.  Status (signatures and ratifications)  Outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sign the agreement during the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on November 30, 2018. The USMCA was signed on November 30, 2018, by all three parties at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, as expected. Disputes over labor rights, steel and aluminum prevented ratification of this version of the agreement. Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, US Trade Representative Robert Lightizer and Mexican Undersecretary for North America Jesus Seade formally signed a revised agreement on December 10, 2019, which was ratified by all three countries as of March 13, 2020. =United States= Domestic procedures for ratification of the agreement in the United States are governed by the Trade Promotion Authority legislation, otherwise known as \\"fast track\\" authority. Growing objections within the member states about U.S. trade policy and various aspects of the USMCA affected the signing and ratification process. Mexico stated they would not sign the USMCA if steel and aluminum tariffs remained. There was speculation after the results of the November 6, 2018 U.S. midterm elections that the Democrats' increased power in the House of Representatives might interfere with the passage of the USMCA agreement. Senior Democrat Bill Pascrell argued for changes to the USMCA to enable it to pass Congress. Republicans opposed USMCA provisions requiring labor rights for LGBTQ and pregnant workers. Forty Congressional Republicans urged Trump against signing a deal that contained \\"the unprecedented inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity language\\"; as a result, Trump ultimately signed a revised version that committed each nation only to \\"policies that it considers appropriate to protect workers against employment discrimination\\" and clarified that the United States would not be required to introduce any additional nondiscrimination laws. The Canadian government expressed concern about the changes evolving within the USMCA agreement. On December 2, 2018, Trump announced that he would begin the 6-month process to withdraw from NAFTA, adding that Congress needed either to ratify the USMCA or else revert to pre-NAFTA trading rules. Academics debate whether the president can unilaterally withdraw from the pact without the approval of Congress. On March 1, 2019, numerous organizations representing the agricultural sector in the U.S. announced their support for the USMCA and urged Congress to ratify the agreement. They also urged the Trump administration to continue upholding NAFTA until the new trade agreement is ratified. However, on March 4, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal predicted a \\"very hard\\" path through Congress for the deal. Starting March 7, senior White House officials met with House Ways and Means members, as well as moderate caucuses from both parties, such as the Problem Solvers Caucus, the Tuesday Group, and the Blue Dog Coalition in their efforts to gain support for ratification. The Trump administration has also backed down from the threat of withdrawing from NAFTA as the negotiations with Congress continued. On May 30, the United States Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer submitted to Congress a draft statement on administrative measures concerning the implementation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA and the new NAFTA) in accordance with the Presidential Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) Act 2015 (Statement of Administrative Action). The draft will allow USMCA implementation legislation to be submitted to Congress after 30 days, on or after June 29. In a letter sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Kevin McCarthy, the House Minority Leader, Republicans, Lighthizer said that the USMCA is the gold standard in U.S. trade policy, modernizing U.S. competitive digital trade, intellectual property, and services provisions and creating a level playing field for U.S. companies, workers and farmers, an agreement that represents a fundamental rebalancing of trade relations between Mexico and Canada. With the draft statement on administrative measures submitted, Speaker Pelosi issued a statement, that U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer should confirm that the draft wording of the USMCA would benefit U.S. workers and farmers and that although she agreed on the need to revise NAFTA, stricter enforcement of labor and environmental protection standards was needed. U.S. President Donald Trump warned on 25 September that an impeachment inquiry against him could derail congressional approval of USMCA, dragging down Mexico's peso and stock market as investors fled riskier assets. The U.S. House of Representatives was proceeding with work on USMCA, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on 26 September. Bloomberg News reported on October 29, 2019, that the Trump administration planned to include in the legislation approving the pact a provision that would allow the USTR to directly control how and where cars and parts are made by global automakers.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-29/trump-white- house-wants-direct-control-over-where-cars-are-made On December 19, 2019, the United States House of Representatives passed the USMCA with bipartisan support by a vote of 385 (Democratic 193, Republican 192) to 41 (Democratic 38, Republican 2, Independent 1). On January 16, 2020, the United States Senate passed the trade agreement by a vote of 89 (Democratic 38, Republican 51) to 10 (Democratic 8, Republican 1, Independent 1) and the bill was forwarded to the White House for Donald Trump's signature. On January 29, 2020, Trump signed the agreement into law (Public Law No: 116‚Äì113). It officially amended NAFTA but not the 1989 Canada‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement which is only \\"suspended,\\" so in case parties fail to extend or renew it in 6 years, FTA would become the law. On April 24, 2020 US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer gave official notice to Congress that the new trade deal is set to come to force on July 1, 2020, and he also notified Canada and Mexico to that effect. On June 1, 2020 the USTR Robert Lighthizer's office has released the uniform regulations, which is the last hurdle before implementing the agreement on July 1, 2020. Text of agreement can be found here: https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states- mexico-canada-agreement/uniform-regulations =Mexico= On June 19, 2019, the Senate of Mexico ratified the agreement (114 yes, 3 no, 3 abstentions). Mexico's ratification procedure will be completed when the President announces ratification in the Federal Register. On December 12, 2019, Mexico's Senate passed the revised treaty by a vote of 107‚Äì1. On April 3, 2020, Mexico announced it was ready to implement the agreement, joining Canada, though it requested that its automotive industry be given extra time to comply with the agreement. Manufacturing in Mexico accounts for 17% of GDP. However, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, the Mexican president believes that this trade deal will be a net positive for the Mexican economy by growing foreign investments, creating jobs, and expanding trade. =Canada= On May 29, 2019, prime minister Justin Trudeau introduced a USMCA implementation billAn Act to implement the Agreement between Canada, the United States of America and the United Mexican States in the House of Commons. On June 20, it passed second reading in the House of Commons and was referred to the Standing Committee on International Trade. Governor General of Canada Julie Payette declared the dissolution of the 42nd Canadian Parliament on September 11, 2019 and formally issued the writs of election for the 2019 Canadian federal election. All pending legislation is scrapped upon any dissolution of Parliament, meaning that the USMCA implementation bill needed to be re-introduced in the 43rd Canadian Parliament which began on December 5, 2019. On December 10, 2019, a revised USMCA agreement was reached by the three countries. On January 29, 2020, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Chrystia Freeland introduced USMCA implementation bill C-4 in the House of Commons and it passed first reading without a recorded vote. On February 6, the bill passed second reading in the House of Commons on a vote of 275 to 28, with the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois voting against and all other parties voting in favor, and it was referred to the Standing Committee on International Trade. On February 27, 2020, the committee voted to send the bill to the full House for third reading, without amendments. On March 13, 2020 the House of Commons passed bill C-4 to implement USMCA before suspending itself for 6 weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the \\"extraordinary circumstances\\", the third and final reading of the bill was deemed to be approved without a recorded vote, as part of an omnibus adjournment motion unanimously approved by all members present. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was not present, since he was in self- isolation at home after his wife Sophie Gr√©goire Trudeau tested positive for COVID-19 infection. On the same day, the Senate passed first, second, and third readings of the bill without recorded votes, and Governor General Julie Payette signed it into law shortly thereafter, completing Canada's ratification of the law. On April 3, 2020, Canada notified the United States and Mexico that it completed its domestic ratification process of the agreement. Impact and analysis U.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks in support of the USMCA in 2019 =Similarities to NAFTA= During his 2016 election campaign and presidency, Trump has been highly critical of NAFTA (oftentimes describing it as \\"perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\\") while extolling USMCA as \\"a terrific deal for all of us.\\" However, the USMCA is very similar to NAFTA, carrying over many of the same provisions and making only modest, mostly cosmetic changes,Geoffrey Gertz, 5 things to know about USMCA, the new NAFTA, Brookings Institution (October 2, 2018). and is expected only to make only a minor economic impact.Tory Newmyer, The Finance 202: USMCA isn't expected to have a big impact on the economy, Washington Post (December 11, 2019). Former U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who oversaw the signing of NAFTA during the Bill Clinton administration, said, \\"It's really the original NAFTA.\\" =Support and criticism= Representatives from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL‚ÄìCIO) have criticized the labor standards in the USMCA as unenforceable and toothless. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said \\"the new rules will make it harder to bring down drug prices for seniors and anyone else who needs access to life-saving medicine\\", reflecting on the measure that expands the patent length for biological substances to 10 years, limiting access for new generic drugs to enter the market. The Trump administration's Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has proposed the USMCA, citing new digital trade measures, the strengthening of protection for trade secrets, and the automobile rules-of-origin adjustments, as some of the benefits of the trade agreement. In a 2018 op-ed, Jim Balsillie, former chair of once-dominant handheld telephone firm Research In Motion, wrote that the \\"colonial supplicant attitude\\" of Canadian politicians was a wrong-headed approach to the data and IP provisions of the USMCA. A report published in summer 2018 was that the National Research Council of Canada feared that domestic firms run the risk of becoming \\"data cows\\" of foreign big data under the provisions of the USMCA. =Economic impact= USMCA is projected to have a very small effect on the economy. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) working paper issued in late March 2019 found that the agreement would have \\"negligible\\" effects on the broad economy.Mary E. Burfisher, Frederic Lambert & Troy D Matheson, NAFTA to USMCA: What is Gained?, International Monetary Fund Working Paper No. 19/73 (March 26, 2019). The IMF study projected that the USMCA \\"would adversely affect trade in the automotive, textiles and apparel sectors, while generating modest aggregate gains in terms of welfare, mostly driven by improved goods market access, with a negligible effect on real GDP.\\" The IMF study noted that the USMCA's economic benefits would be greatly enhanced if there was an end to the Trump trade war (i.e., if the U.S. eliminated tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico dropped retaliatory tariffs on imports from the U.S.) An April 2019 International Trade Commission analysis on the likely impact of the USMCA estimated that the agreement, when fully implemented (six years following ratification) would increase U.S. real GDP by 0.35% and would increase U.S. total employment by 0.12% (176,000 jobs).United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement: Likely Impact on the U.S. Economy and Specific Industry Sectors (with errata), United States International Trade Commission, Publication No. 4889, Investigation No. TPA 105-003 (April 2019). The analysis cited by another study from the Congressional Research Service found the agreement would not have a measurable effect on jobs, wages, or overall economic growth. In the summer of 2019, Trump's top economic advisor Larry Kudlow (the director of the National Economic Council in the Trump White House) made unsupported claims regarding the likely economic impact of the agreement, overstating projections related to jobs and GDP growth. In December 2019, Thea M. Lee and Robert E. Scott of the Economic Policy Institute criticized USMCA as \\"weak tea, at best\\" because it would have \\"virtually no measurable impacts on wages or incomes for U.S. workers,\\" noting that \\"The benefits are tiny, and it's highly uncertain whether the deal will be a net winner or loser, in the end.\\"Thea M. Lee & Robert E. Scott, Statement: U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement‚ÄîWeak tea, at best, Economic Policy Institution (December 10, 2019). In June 2020, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Japanese auto companies are opting to \\"triple Mexican pay rather than move to US\\" in order to avoid tariffs on automotive parts.

The church formerly had a bookstore and various other ministry as well. At one point the church had nearly 1,500 members. Beliefs and mission The mission of First Baptist Church is to glorify God by Worshipping with others as a cooperate body of believers, Growing closer to God and other together, and Serving the surrounding communities. The beliefs center on these 15 principles: * The Bible was written by men, supernaturally inspired by God. * The Bible, God's Word, is 100% true. * There is only one living and true God. * The Holy Spirit is a divine person; equal with God the Father and God the Son and of the same nature. * Literal account of creation found in Genesis. * Man was created in innocence, but voluntary sinned against God. * Jesus Christ was begotten of the Holy Ghost in a miraculous manner. * Salvation of sinners is entirely by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. * God's grace and free gift of salvation has been made available to all. * The great gospel blessing, which Christ secures to such as believe in Him, is Justification. * Repentance and faith are solemn obligation, and also inseparable graces, wrought in our souls by the quickening Spirit of God. * A church of Christ is a congregation of baptized believers, associated by a covenant of faith and fellowship of the gospel. * Christian baptism of a believer is the immersion in water into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. * There is radical and essential difference between the righteous and the wicked. * Civil government is of divine appointment for the interests and good order of human society. History First Baptist Church was founded on April 7, 1870 when the need for a Baptist church is Hackensack came. In 1916, with 179 members, Dr. Harry C. Leach came to be Senior Pastor. Under his 32 years of leadership, he helped grow the church to 850 members. In 1923, the church constructed the classical church sanctuary. When Dr. Leach retired in 1948, Pastor Joseph M. Stowell came to be the Senior Pastor. He then helped grow the church to nearly 1,400 members. In 1953, the church constructed the Bible School Building, which was able to house 1,000 pupils. Following Pastor Stowell, in 1970, Pastor Robert C. Gage came to be Senior Pastor. Under his leadership, the church began Hackensack Christian Schools, a Pre-K thru 12th grade school. Near the end of his leadership in 1977, the church constructed the Leach Memorial Building, which housed a athletic center, classrooms, and science labs for the Christian School. In 1980, Pastor Gage left to pastor First Baptist Church in the City of New York. In 2017, the school was renamed to Bergen County Christian Academy in order to have a stronger reach into the community. * Original Chapel constructed, 1880 * Current Sanctuary constructed, 1923 * Annual Missionary Conferences, 1946 * Daily Vacation Bible School (reinstituted 1950) * Bible School Building constructed, 1953 * Lending Library (1953 in the Bible School Building, previously opened in the former chapel) * Cornerstone Day Camp * Bergen County Christian Academy (formerly Hackensack Christian School), 1972 * New Life Island, 1972 * Leach Memorial Building constructed, 1977 * Missionary House & Parsonage Duplex constructed, 1997 Bergen County Christian Academy Bergen County Christian Academy is located on the church campus and has approximately 150 students enrolled in pre-kindergarten through grade 12.

It documents human presence since ca. 12000 years ago presenting three discrete occupation phases that correspond to the early, middle and late Holocene. Llithic technology, zooarchaeology, and multi- isotopic analyses indicate groups of hunter gathers with low mobility and a subsistence strategy focused on gathering plant foods and hunting small and mid-sized mammals. The use of Lapa do Santo as an interment ground started between 10.3-10.6 cal kyBP with primary burials. Between 9.4-9.6 cal kyBP central elements in the treatment of the dead were tooth removal, mutilation, defleshing, exposure to fire and possibly cannibalism, all to reduce the body ahead of reburial of the remains while adhering to strict rules. In the absence of monumental architecture or grave goods, these groups were using parts of fresh corpses to elaborate their rituals. As part of this funerary agenda Lapa do Santo presents the oldest case in the New World of decapitation. Another type of burial included pits filled with separated bones of a single individuals presenting abundant evidence of perimortem fracturing. Lapa do Santo also presents a rare instance of securely dated rock art: an early Holocene low relief anthropomorphic figure depicting a phallus.  History of research  Lagoa Santa is located in east-central Brazil and is well known among archaeologist and paleontologists since the 19th century. The first human skeletons were found by the Danish naturalist Peter Lund between 1835 and 1844 in the Sumidouro cave in association with bones of extinct megafauna. Due to this putative coexistence of humans and megafauna Lagoa Santa became the focus of many 19th century scholars. During the 20th centuries different teams went to the region pursuing to find evidence that could confirm the coexistence hypothesis. As a result of more than 170 years of excavations a large collection of early Holocene skeletons was formed. However, all those excavation were done in a time when proper documentation was not available and therefore they considerably lack contextual information. Coordinated by Prof. Walter Neves of University of S√£o Paulo and funded by the S√£o Paulo State Grant Foundation (FAPESP) the project ‚ÄúOrigins and Microevolution of Man in America: a Paleoanthropological Approach‚Äù aimed to overcome this situation by identifying and excavating new sites in Lagoa Santa region. Excavations took place between 2001 and 2009 under the coordination of Renato Kipnis, Astolfo Gomes Melo Araujo and Danilo Bernardo. Starting in 2001 several units were open in distinct areas of the shelter. It became apparent that the densest archaeological deposits were located in the south part of the shelter, immediately in front of the cave's entrance. An ample excavation surface was established in this region becoming the Main Excavation Area (MEA). All human burials were found in the MEA. Excavations of the MEA ended in 2009 when, according to Brazilian laws, the excavated area was filled with sediments recomposing the original topography of the shelter's floor. In 2011, a new excavation area was open in Lapa do Santo as part of another research project. Entitled \\"The Mortuary Rituals of the First Americans\\" and coordinated by Andr√© Strauss and Rodrigo Elias Oliveira this was a joint venture between the Department of Human Evolution of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Institute of Biosciences of University of S√£o Paulo.  The rockshelter and the archaeological site ‚ÄúLapa‚Äù and ‚ÄúSanto‚Äù are the Portuguese words for, ‚Äúrockshelter‚Äù and ‚Äúsaint‚Äù. Lapa do Santo is a cave with an associated sheltered area of ca. 1300 m2. The southern region of the sheltered area has a relatively flat, height and dry area located immediately in front of the cave's entrance. The floor of the shelter has a strong descending inclination towards the north, which becomes flat again near a natural sinkhole located at the northern extreme of the sheltered area. A three-dimension coordinate system (x,y,z) was established in Lapa do Santo. The y-axis was conveniently oriented following the longer dimensions of the sheltered area, which is, in turn, roughly aligned with the geographic north-south axis (increasing towards the north). Therefore, the y-axis is also referred to as the north-south or N-S axis. The x-axis is perpendicular to the y-axis and is therefore roughly aligned with geographic east-west (increasing towards east). The x-axis is also referred to as the east-west or E-W axis. X-axis and y-axis define a horizontal plane. The z-axis is perpendicular to the plane defined by x-axis and y-axis and is therefore also referred to as the vertical axis or absolute depth (decreasing with progressive depth). The origin of the coordinate system (i.e. x=0, y=0, y=0) was conveniently positioned outside the sheltered area. An arbitrary grid with squares of 1 meter per side was established starting from the origin of the coordinate system. In the x-axis, each one-meter interval was sequentially labeled with letters (A,B,C,D, etc.) and in the y-axis, each one-meter interval was sequentially labeled with numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.). The excavation of the site followed this grid and the unit's code refers to this system (e.g. L11, B13, Z14).

File:Lapa-do-Santo-Overview-Site-tour.mpg.webmLapa do Santo. Video tour 2011  Physical setting  Lapa do Santo is located in Lagoa Santa region, eastern central Brazil. Lagoa Santa is an environmentally protected area comprising 360 km2. The vegetation is dominated by savanna (cerrado) and semi-deciduous forest. The rivers Mocambo, Samambaia, Jaguara and Gordura make up a tributary net that flows west to east to Velhas River, the main river in the area. Geomorphologically Lagoa Santa is a karstic terrain that can be divided into four distinct domains: 1) below 660 meters above sea level (masl) the terrain is characterized by a fluvial plain connected with the regional base level (Velhas River); 2) between 660 and 750 masl there is a karstic plain with dolines and lakes 3) between 750 and 850 masl there are karstic plateaus characterized by the presence of limestone outcrops (reaching up to 75 meters in height); 4) above 850 masl residual peaks composed of the non- soluble metasedimentary rocks from the Serra da Santa Helena Formation. The Lagoa Santa region geology comprises Sete Lagoas Formation and Serra da Santa Helena Formation, both part of the Upper Proterozoic metassediments of the Bambu√≠ Group of the S√£o Francisco craton. This cratonic cover metamorphosed during the Brazilian Cycle (700-450 million years ago) in a process that resulted in planar structures, such as lineation and foliation, and sub- vertical structures, such as normal and revert faults. The combination of these structures provides the path for the geomorphologic evolution that leads to the rockshelter configurations found in the region. The regional rockshelters and outcrops are developed in the limestone of the Sete Lagoas Formation. More specifically, Lapa do Santo rockshelter developed in the Member Pedro Leopoldo that is composed by very pure limestones with more than 90% calcite. The annual mean temperature is 23 ¬∞C, with lower temperatures (11 ¬∞C) occurring between June and July and higher temperatures (35 ¬∞C) occurring between October and November. The average humidity is around 65% in the dry season, from May to September, and around 85% on the rainy season, from November to April, with a pluviometrical mean of 1,400 mm/year. The major climatic characteristic of this region is the high concentration of rain during the rainy season (93% of total volume). When evaporation is analyzed, the region presents an annual deficit of 176 mm. Despite these particular variations, the regional climate is classified as tropical, with a rainy summer and dry winter. During dry periods, the above ground water sources can become very scarce although underground drainages are capable of keeping the discharge in Velhas River.  Chronology  Graph showing all dates of Lapa do Santo relative to depth (z-value). The chronology of the site is based on OSL and radiocarbon dating and it defines three distinct human occupation periods with the oldest one starting at 12.7-11.7 cal kyBP (all chronological ranges are based on a 95.4% interval). If we consider a 95.4% confidence interval Lapa do Santo's Period 1 (LSP-1) starts at 12.7 cal kyBP and ends at 7.9 cal kyBP, Lapa do Santo's Period 2 (LSP-2) starts at 5.4 cal kyBP and ends at 3.9 cal kyBP; Lapa do Santo's Period 3 (LSP-3) starts at 2.1 cal kyBP and ends at 0.0 cal kyBP. When the three periods are considered there is a very good agreement between vertical position (i.e., z-value) and dated charcoals showing the stratigraphic integrity of the deposits. At Lapa do Santo a total of 63 charcoal samples were selected for radiocarbon dating. Of those 53 were sent to the Beta Analytic AMS system in Miami and 10 to the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit. In total 21 sediment samples were collected for luminescence dating, including two outside the shelter in the lake basin. The samples were mainly collected from test unit Q48 in the northern part of the shelter, from a T-shaped trench extending from the northern to southern part of the shelter, and from test units F13 and M6 in the main area of excavation. Analysis were conducted by Prof. James K. Feathers of the University of Washington. According to the OSL samples the earliest human occupation appears to date from about 9.0 to 12.0 kyBP, consistent with other paleoindian occupations in Lagoa Santa. In the unit F13 dates are at least two thousand years older than the dates obtained from radiocarbon.  Formation processes and stratigraphy  Section showing the location of key elements of the site. Dated charcoal are shown as colored circles. Formation process analysis characterizes Lapa do Santo's deposits as mainly anthropogenic and composed by repeated combustion activities, indicating an intense occupation of the same locality over time. The macro stratigraphy of Lapa do Santo shows an intercalation of layers with diffuse to sharp boundaries that can be divided into three main categories, from the more to the less frequent: 1) tabular, grey, centimetric layers of powdery carbonate sediments, with common sand grains and frequent to common red clay aggregates and charcoal (20-40 %); 2) lenticular, red centimetric layers of indurated clay minerals with rare charcoal fragments; 3) lenticular, black, milimetric and centimetric layers, with high concentration of charcoal and microcharcoal. The ash crystals are described as rhombohedric micro- crystalline calcite crystals (10-30 ¬µm). The crystals develop after burning of the calcium oxalates that naturally appear in the plant cells at temperatures around 400-600 ¬∞C. Ash crystals, also described as pseudomorphs of calcium oxalate into calcite (POCC), are the diagnostic micromorphological trait of plant ashes. Ash crystals have an overall good preservation. The clay aggregates are always blocky, angular to sub-rounded. They appear in frequencies from 10-70% and show three distinct colors: red, orange and yellow. The differences could be related with the natural Fe2O3 content or to the anthropic modification of the clay aggregates (by human fires), as suggested by the dark red rims. Bioturbation of the sediments is indicated by channel and chamber voids, seen in most of the thin sections, passage features and large faunal channels. However, bioturbation was generally not intense since fragile components, such as tissue residues, laminations of fine plant tissue and articulated ashes show good integrity. The mixing of geogenic (clay aggregates) and anthropogenic sediments (ashes) seen in Lapa do Santo is a frequent characteristic in rockshelters of Lagoa Santa. Ashes from anthropic fires have been described in the sediments of Lapa das Boleiras and Lapa Grande de Taquara√ßu.

Results of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis indicate a diet where protein mainly came from plant food resources. Together with dental caries frequencies comparable to those observed among agricultural populations, the emerging picture is of a typical early Archaic economy structured around staple carbohydrates complemented by hunting of small and mid-sized animals. = Zooarchaeology = Zooarchaeological analyses are key to better understand the relationship between humans and other animal populations, specifically for studies on diet and hunting strategies. For the faunal analyses at Lapa do Santo A standard zooarchaeological methodology was adopted. The Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) and Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) was computed for a sample of faunal assemblage coming from units: L7, L8, L10, M3, M4, M5, M6, and from archaeological strata contemporary to the early Holocene human remains. The results point to a faunal assemblage dominated by small and medium-sized mammals, as well as reptiles, birds and fishes. Bigger mammals, such as deer and peccaries are also present in the faunal assemblage, but not as predominantly as one would expect based on their much higher return rate when compared to medium-sized animals; but in accordance with evolutionary ecology models for prehistoric foraging societies in Central Brazil. The fact that almost all the anatomical parts of deer are represented indicates a subsistence/dietary strategy that is not targeting specific body parts when analyzed against Food Utility Index (FUI). The game was not dismembered in the killing site, but brought as entire piece to the dwelling camp. = Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes = Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis on bone collagen is widely used in archaeology for reconstructing ancient diets. A total of 17 human bones and 51 faunal bones from the early Holocene deposits of Lapa do Santo were analysed with this technique. Due to poor preservation conditions only eight human from Lapa do Santo and 22 faunal samples from Lagoa Santa provided collagen with an acceptable C:N ratio between 2.9 and 3.6. The material was analyzedin three different laboratories: the Dorothy Garrod Laboratory for Isotopic Analysis of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge (UC); the Laborat√≥rio de Ecologia Isot√≥pica (Isotope Ecology Lab) at the Escola Superior de Agricultura Luis de Queir√≥s, University of S√£o Paulo (ESALQ-USP); and the isotope facilities at the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA). Results for the fauna are mostly consistent with their dietary habits. Deer (Mazama sp.;Cervidae, Goldfuss 1820) are browsing animals, and in the savannas of central Brazil normally feed on more 13C-depleted gallery forest plants. Their predominantly C3 plant based diet is compatible with the observed collagen isotope values of d13C -20.7¬±1.6‚Ä∞ and d15N 6.0¬±1.9 ‚Ä∞ (1 sigma interval, n=10). Tayassuidae (Palmer 1897) have generalist omnivore diets. The total of 6 analyzed collagen samples of this animal clustered into two groups of three samples each. One group has a typical C3 type herbivore diet, very similar to that found in deer, averaging d13C -22.5¬±1.0‚Ä∞ and d15N 4.7¬±0.5‚Ä∞; whilst the other group has a more carnivore-like diet, averaging d13C -16.5¬±1.0‚Ä∞ and d15N 9.7¬±0.3‚Ä∞. This difference could be due to a number of reasons such as their broad alimentary range, inter-species variation, environmental changes, or the small sample size. Both armadillo species, Dasypus novencinctusand Euphractus sexcinctus (Dasypodidae, Gray 1821) are omnivores with a tendency to carnivory. Both species have collagen isotope values compatible with a carnivorous behavior averaging d13C -14.9¬±1.7‚Ä∞, d15N 8.2¬±0.5‚Ä∞ (n=3) and d13C -18.4‚Ä∞, d15N 8.2‚Ä∞ (n=2), respectively. The human results are invariant in their d13C values, displaying a mean of d13C -19.0¬±0.6‚Ä∞ and, therefore, indicating a predominately C3 based diet. The d15N values range from 5.3 to 11.3‚Ä∞. The most enriched d15N value comes from an infant with non-erupted permanent dentition and probably reflects breastfeeding. Sub-adults with erupted permanent deciduous already have d15N values more similar to adults. The low d15N values in the adult population is distinct from the carnivores (t=4.50; p=0.001) and similar to the herbivores from Lagoa Santa region (t=0.25; p=0.400), suggesting a diet based on plants and supplemented by fauna. This is consistent with zooarchaeological studies from central Brazil pointing to a generalist diet mostly based on the gathering of plants but supplemented by small game. = Dental pathologies = Dental pathologies are used as a dietary proxy in bioarchaeological studies. As expected for generalist foragers living in a tropical environment, the elevated frequency of dental abscesses and caries has been reported for early Holocene Lagoa Santa, particularly among females. In an environment with a wide variety of tubers and fruits such as pequi (Caryocar brasiliense), jatob√° (Hymenaea sp.) and araticum (Annona classiflora), it is expected that humans would have had a diverse diet instead of focusing exclusively on meat. = Mobility = Human enamel strontium isotopic values that are close to the range of the local bioavailable signature are consistent with a subsistence strategy based on immediately available local resources. Low levels of mobility are also supported by previous studies of the femur's midshaft morphology. The abandonment of allochthonous raw material for lithic production after 9.9 cal kyBP could indicate the moment when this less mobile mode of life began. = Hand use = Lapa do Santo - Bones of the hand The trabecular structure of Lapa do Santo hand bones was compared to a large series of human and neanderthal populations. Results are consistent with heavy use of the hand for knapping activities and a variable loading during manipulation.  Technology  The lithic assemblage is dominated by small flakes and cores. Crystal quartz was by far the dominant raw material, but silex, quartzite and silicified sandstone were also used. There is no clear division between artifact and debitage, and every flake is a potential tool. With the exception of a single hematite blade and an arrow point, formal artifacts are inexistent. The flakes were discarded when their edge became dull and most of them were used only a few times. Feather scars, occasional scaler and snap fractures were identified by preliminary use-wear analysis of flakes from Lapa do Santo indicating they were used to cut soft materials such as hides, meat, cordage and grasses. While lithic types were constant through time, the use of raw material varied and around 9.9 cal kyBP non-local sources such as silexite were no longer exploited with the locally available crystal quartz becoming dominant. The bone artifacts from Lapa do Santo are very similar to what is observed in other parts of central Brazil during the same timeframe. They contrast sharply with the expedient technological approach adopted for the production of lithic artifacts.

Lapa Santo can therefore be characterized as a typical Lagoa Santa group. Similar results were obtained with dental metric data. Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from 11 individuals from Lapa do Santo (A2=5, B2=3, C1d1=1, D4h3a=2). The presence of the haplogroup D4h3a disproves previous suggestions that this was related to a coastal expansion. Nuclear DNA was extracted from 7 individuals from Lapa do Santo. Four individuals have the Q1a2a Y-chromosome haplogrpup and one individual the C2b Y-chromosome haplogroup. The former and later haplogroups are rare and extremely rare in recent Native Americans, respectevely. Haplogroup C2b is so rare that it was proposed to represent a post 6000 years arrival to the continent - an hypothesis disproved by the data from Lapa do Santo. Lapa do Santo has one individual with the ancestral alelle for the EDAR gene showing that the derived alelle EDAR V370A - present in 100% of present-day Native Americans and East Asians - was not yet fixed by the early Holocene implying on convergente evolution on both sides of the Pacific. Genomic analysis of ca. 1.2 million SNPs indicates that the individuals from Lapa do Santo were exclusively related with other Native Americans with an important contribution from Clovis related populations. Lapa do Santo's facial features can be visualized by a forensic reconstruction made by Prof. Caroline Wilkinson based on a virtually retro-deformed 3D model of the cranium of Burial 26.

LSMP-2a is characterized by fully articulated partial skeletons with cutting and chopping marks. In Burial 21, the midshafts of both tibiae and fibulae were chopped and removed while soft tissue was still present. Burial 26 is a severed head with the first six cervical vertebrae articulated in anatomical position. The hyoid bone was missing and both amputated hands were laid over the face. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy of the cut-marks shows the presence of parallel micro-striations and a V-shaped transversal profile, indicating the use of stone flakes as the cutting agent. In conjunction the evidence show LSMP-2a involved the mutilation of fresh corpses.

Some bones show evidence of exposure to fire, application of red pigment, defleshing, cutting, chopping and removal of teeth. Burials 14, 17 and 18 were composed of a bundle of long bones from one or two individuals, deposited with the individualized cranium and/or mandible of a different individual. Bundles comprising infant post-cranial bones were found next to adult crania (Burials 14 and 17), and bundles comprising adult post-cranial bones were found next to an infant cranium (Burial 18). The long bones of the bundles had been chopped and segregated into extremities and midshafts and in some cases the latter were further chopped into smaller sections. The cranium of Burial 17 was used as a funerary receptacle and filled with chopped burnt bones some of which present defleshing cut-marks. Black burn marks limited to the anterior portion of the external maxillary alveolar margin indicate exposure to fire while soft tissue was still present. The co-occurrence of chopped and defleshed bones with signs of burning with soft tissues suggests that LSMP-2 may have involved some form of cannibalism. In Burials 17 and 18, all teeth were intentionally removed and the coronoid processes of Burial 18's mandible were drilled. Red pigment was abundantly applied to the bones of Burial 14and Burial 18. Burial 23 was composed of a cranium calotte filled with 54 permanent and 30 deciduous teeth, some of which belonged to the skull of Burial 17. Burial 9 was an individualized child skull placed near the pelvis of an individual of similar age. The deciduous dentition was removed and an assemblage of human teeth and chopped midshafts (accession code: LSt-2253) were deposited next to Burial 9. LSMP-2c is defined by isolated burnt chopped bones that were not part of any formal burial and the presence of rodent gnaw marks could indicate they were subject to scavenging and not immediately buried.

Burials are characterized by shallow circular pits completely filled with mostly disarticulated bones of single individuals of various ages and sexes. Circular stone structures covered some of the burials, but also occur independently of them. Anatomical selection was not observed and, with the exception of some small bones, most elements of the skeleton were present. The midshafts of long bones of adult individuals were in some cases intentionally broken in the central region before deposition, resulting in butterfly fractures with impact points indicating the use of some percussion instrument. The burials belonging to LSMP-3 are very similar to each other, contrasting the larger variability observed within LSMP-2. Furthermore, characteristic elements of the latter, such as cut-marks, chop-marks, absence of dentition, red pigment, and burnt marks are not present in the former.

It recounts the events of the Iliad, chiefly from the point of view of Briseis.  Plot summary  The plot begins when Greeks led Achilles sack Lyrnessus, describing the looting and burning of the city, the massacre of its men and the abduction of its women including Briseis, the childless wife of its king Mynes. When the women are handed out to the leaders of the Greek raiders, Briseis, as a royal (and according to the Iliad, beautiful) is awarded to Achilles. The plot then becomes that of the Iliad, covering the dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon over Chryseis which results in Achilles yielding Briseis to Agamemnon, Achilles' subsequent refusal to join the fighting, then the deaths of Patroclus, Hector, and finally Achilles. Briseis has become pregnant with Achilles' child shortly before his death, of which Achilles has foreknowledge; he marries her to one of his lieutenants and the story ends as they depart the Trojan shores to return to their homes. The story is told chiefly by Briseis in the first person, with interjections giving Achilles' internal state of mind. However, as the title suggests, Briseis' narrative is almost entirely internal; except in flashbacks to times before her capture, she speaks out loud hardly at all, only a few handfuls of words. Parts of the closing sequence, describing the fate of Troy's women and the sacrifice of Priam's daughter at Achilles' burial mound, are taken from The Trojan Women by Euripides. The novel features appearances by many characters from the Iliad including Priam, Nestor, Ajax the Great, Agamemnon, and Helen of Troy. It portrays with great intensity the brutality and filth of the war, and the emotional state of Achilles and Patroclus. Achilles' mother, the Nereid Thetis, appears but only speaks to Achilles when he grieves for Patroclus and she asks what's wrong and says she will bring him armor.  Critical reception  The Silence of the Girls was generally well-received. Reviewers universally noted the novel's intense, often coarsely raw, portrayal of women's experience of war and its complete lack of glamorisation or praise of anything military. The following passage was excerpted by multiple reviewers: No longer an issue of decorum, now it‚Äôs about staying alive. \\"I do what no man before me has ever done, I kiss the hands of the man who killed my son,\\" declares Priam when he prostrates himself before Achilles begging for Hector‚Äôs body. ‚ÄúAnd I do what countless women before me have been forced to do,\\" Briseis thinks bitterly, \\"I spread my legs for the man who killed my husband and my brothers.\\" Some reviewers (Gilbert in The Atlantic, Wilson in The Guardian) commented with disfavor on Barker's use of contemporary idioms, arguing that it was jarringly out of sync with the novel's Trojan-war backdrop. Several noted the parallel with Circe by Madeline Miller, also from 2018 and also accomplished by turning a minor figure from Homeric myth into the protagonist of a novel.

It refers to the perceived necessity of accepting women's allegations of sexual harassment or sexual assault at face value. Sady Doyle, writing for Elle, argues that the phrase means \\"don't assume women as a gender are especially deceptive or vindictive, and recognize that false allegations are less common than real ones.\\" The phrase grew in popularity in response to the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination. On September 28, 2018, the dating app Bumble took out a full page advertisement in The New York Times saying simply, \\"Believe women\\". The slogan has been criticized for encouraging a presumption of guilt. Michelle Malkin, writing for The Daily Signal, suggests that it is a form of virtue signalling. Rebecca Traister, writing for The Cut, calls the phrase \\"compelling but flawed\\": it is often recast as \\"believe all women\\", and used as a \\"deeply problematic\\" and \\"clumsy imperative\\" that has \\"enfeebled the far more important argument that we should encourage them to speak more, and listen to them more seriously when they talk.\\" Monica Hesse, in The Washington Post, argues that the slogan has always been \\"believe women,\\" and that the \\"believe all women\\" variant is \\"a bit of grammatical gaslighting,\\" a straw man invented by critics so that it could be attacked. In April 2020, a number of politicians and commentators discussed the Joe Biden sexual assault allegation in relation to the \\"Believe women\\" slogan. Representative Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez criticized what she regarded as a lack of integrity relating to the issue: \\"If we again want to have integrity, you can't say, you know ‚Äî both believe women, support all of this, until it inconveniences you, until it inconveniences us.\\" The National Review criticized what it considered to be Biden's hypocrisy in \\"his demand that Americans must believe women as a matter of unwavering reflex\\" during the Kavanaugh nomination. The editors said, \\"we hope that this incident has taught Biden that his previous approach toward accusations of sexual assault was dangerous, illiberal, and ultimately untenable.\\" On the other hand, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand stood by Biden and remarked, \\"When we say 'believe women,' it's for this explicit intention of making sure there's space for all women to come forward to speak their truth, to be heard. And in this allegation, that is what Tara Reade has done.\\" According to The Atlantic, the adoption of a rule in Britain according to which law enforcement should believe reports of sexual assault and consider complainants to be victims led to improper police investigation of claims and the overlooking of contradicting evidence, resulting in the collapse of prosecutions.https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/brett- kavanaugh-and-problem- believesurvivors/572083/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/20/police- should-refer-complainants-not-victims-investigating-rape/ See also * 2017‚Äì18 United States political sexual scandals * False accusation of rape References Category:American political catchphrases Category:Belief Category:Hashtags Category:Women ","title":"Believe women"},{"id":"58621086","text":"Namasthe Bali is a 2015 Malayalam language film produced by Minhal Mohammed Ali under the banner of Minhal Productions.

O. Schwagerl, was a Bavarian-American landscape architect who served as Superintendent of Parks for Cleveland, Ohio, and Seattle, Washington. He designed or contributed to the design of a number of cemeteries and parks, including Gordon Park and Riverside Cemetery in Cleveland, Wright Park and Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, Washington, and Denny Park and Kinnear Park in Seattle, and also proposed a master plan for Seattle's park system.  Life  Schwagerl was born to Leonard and Madaline Schwagerl on January 14, 1842, in W√ºrzburg, Bavaria, but lived his early life in Paris, where he was educated by private tutors. At age 12, he traveled alone to New York with plans to accompany his brother on a trip to Costa Rica, but when his brother failed to meet him, he was forced to find work in restaurants and department stores. He began attending the New Hampshire Conference Seminary (now the Tilton School) in Tilton, New Hampshire, at age 19 and considered a career as a minister before deciding against it. He served as an engineer in the Civil War from 1864 to 1865, after which he returned to Paris for a time. During this second stay in Paris, he assisted an architect who was designing the grounds for the Exposition Universelle of 1867. Upon returning to the United States, Schwagerl worked for landscape architect Jacob Weidenmann in Hartford, Connecticut for 18 months, helped prepare Weidenmann's book on landscape gardening, and by 1868 was working as an architect in Omaha, Nebraska. He moved several times in the following decade, and in 1870 was working in St. Louis, Missouri before moving his firm back east to Philadelphia, and by 1880 he was living in Cleveland, Ohio. By 1889 he was living in Tacoma and lived either there or Seattle for the rest of his life. = Family and personal life = Schwagerl was an avid Theosophist who travelled to help set up local Theosophist branches and delivered lectures on topics such as Occultism. He briefly moved to Kingston, Washington, in 1892 with the aim of establishing a Theosophist colony. He married Ella Varnes in Cleveland in 1883. He filed for divorce in 1892 and accused Ella of having an affair with her uncle, which she denied. Ella alleged cruelty in a counter-claim, prevailed in court, and was awarded custody of their child. In 1894, he married Frances McKay, a fellow Theosophist, to whom he remained married until his death on January 27, 1910.  Career  Schwagerl was responsible for either the original design of or improvements to a variety of public and private parks and buildings throughout his career. = Missouri = Schwagerl was working in and around St. Louis, Missouri, by 1870. Up the river at Hannibal, he designed the grounds for Mt. Olivet Cemetery, where Mark Twain had his parents and brothers interred a few years later. In 1873, he oversaw improvements to the grounds of the North Missouri State Normal School (now Truman State University). He also worked on the layout of Lindell Boulevard and Vandeventer Place in St. Louis. = Ohio = Between 1875 and 1876, Schwagerl worked on the design of Riverside Cemetery in Cleveland, on which ground was broken in April 1876. Sufficient progress had been made by that November for the cemetery to be inaugurated in a ceremony that featured guests, among them Schwagerl and President-elect Rutherford B. Hayes, each planting a tree that was dedicated in their honor. His work \\"was widely regarded as one of the most notable new cemetery designs of the era.\\" John D. Rockefeller hired Schwagerl in 1880 to survey his property at Forest Hill, and again in 1881 to lay out the grounds and drives of his mansion on Cleveland's Millionaires' Row. During this same period, Schwagerl was working on improving park land belonging to William J. Gordon that was later given to the city and is now known as Gordon Park. Following up his work on Riverside Cemetery, he also helped design a chapel at Woodland Cemetery in 1880. In 1882, Schwagerl designed improvements to Monumental Square (now Public Square) that included a new stone speakers' platform called the Oratorium, and later that year was commissioned by the city of Cleveland to lay out Wade Park on land willed to the city by industrialist Jeptha Wade. He served as Superintendent of Parks for Cleveland from January 1883 until his resignation in 1884. = South Carolina = In March 1878, while Schwagerl was living in Philadelphia, the Secretary of State of South Carolina engaged him to design the grounds of the State House, which had remained unfinished due to the Civil War and Reconstruction. His design, in Beaux-Arts style, was implemented by April of the following year. = Oregon = A rendering of the proposed design for a chapel and receiving vault at the River View Cemetery in Portland, Oregon, by the cemetery's designer, E. O. Schwagerl. Schwagerl's first commission in the Pacific Northwest came while he was still working in Cleveland, when banker Henry Failing commissioned him in mid-1879 to design River View Cemetery in Portland, Oregon, designs for which Schwagerl finished by that December. In addition to laying out the cemetery grounds, he designed several buildings, including a chapel and receiving vault (pictured), but these were never built. The cemetery design was favorably received, with one review calling it \\"the most beautiful cemetery on the Pacific Coast.\\" Schwagerl returned to Cleveland after a further proposal to lay out the grounds of City Park (now Washington Park) was not accepted. = Washington = He returned to the Northwest on a more permanent basis by 1889, when he was working in Tacoma designing the Lucius Manning residence. The following year, Tacoma's park board selected Schwagerl to design a public park (now known as Wright Park) on 27 acres that had been donated by Philadelphia-based financier Charles Barstow Wright. He also surveyed, mapped, and created designs for Point Defiance Park on land that had been recently ceded to the city of Tacoma by the federal government. Political differences in Tacoma, including concerns over the cost of the parks, led to Schwagerl being dismissed, and his friend Eben R. Roberts was appointed superintendent to oversee completion of the projects. By May 1892, Schwagerl had been named Superintendent of Parks in Seattle. He oversaw the completion of Kinnear Park and was responsible for the design of the plantings and other amenities. He also revised the design of Denny Park \\"along formal lines with prettily conceived walks, mounds and sloping lawns, ornamented with clusters of trees, shrubbery and flowering plant which thrive,\\" although the modern park was redesigned after being leveled as part of the Denny Regrade. He made some of the early improvements to what is now Volunteer Park, including building a nursery stocked with over 100,000 plants intended for eventual use in other Seattle parks. He was also an early proponent of extending federal protection to Mount Rainier and its surrounding area, in order to save it from degradation due to overuse and vandalism. He said, \\"It is not foreign to the mission of the city‚Äôs park commission to be informed of some of the facts relative to the United States reservation created and designated as the 'Pacific Coast Park Reserve,'\\" and urged the park commission to petition the Secretary of Interior to take steps to protect the area. Schwagerl's most recognized contribution to Seattle was development of a comprehensive plan for Seattle parks that he said, \\"provides for a system of attenuated parks and boulevards. It embraces four main parks, each park consisting of a natural project of peerless scope, breadth and range at the four corners, as it were, of the city.\\" The four sites he identified include three modern-day parks, Seward Park, Discovery Park, and Magnuson Park, as well as Alki Point. He envisioned a \\"continuous boulevard, from 150 to 300 feet wide,\\" encircling the city, which would branch off into smaller boulevards and parks. Despite the plan receiving enthusiastic support from the mayor and park commissioners, the city's financial difficulties caused by the ongoing recovery from the Great Seattle Fire and the Panic of 1893 meant no immediate progress was made. In 1895, Schwagerl was retained to design the site of the Whatcom Normal School (now Western Washington University). He resigned his position as superintendent, effective at the end of 1895, and moved back to Tacoma to take up a position at Puget Sound University. His job was to design its permanent campus at University Place along with surrounding residential tracts, whose sale was supposed to fund the campus project. However, several years of financial trouble around servicing the debt on the project meant the campus was never built at University Place, which today is a purely residential area. Schwagerl returned to private practice in Seattle thereafter, and in 1906 was asked to develop the new Mount Baker Addition along with George F. Cotterill, as part of the Olmsted Brothers' citywide park system that had been initiated in 1903. Among the designs Schwagerl contributed were those for Mount Baker Park.  Legacy  When John C. Olmsted was brought to Seattle to implement a citywide parks system in 1903, he had sharp criticism of Schwagerl's work, writing to his wife of Denny Park: ‚ÄúHis walks are very crooked often and his banks steep and high and his plantings very mixed but pretty much the same selection for every place.\\" His opinion of Schwagerl's talents were summed up with: \\"[He] seems to be no very considerable artist in his line.\\" The Olmsted Brothers liked Schwagerl's work in Kinnear Park and left it relatively unchanged. Seattle's city engineer R. H. Thomson said the final Olmsted plan was \\"almost identical\\" to the one Schwagerl had proposed ten years earlier. Some present-day architects have assessed Schwagerl as \\"remarkable and distinguished\\" and \\"Seattle‚Äôs most important pioneer landscape architect.\\" Notes  References  Category:1842 births Category:1910 deaths Category:American landscape architects Category:American urban planners Category:American landscape and garden designers Category:People of the American Civil War Category:People from W√ºrzburg Category:History of Seattle ","title":"E.

The episode was written by Bo Crese and directed by Edward Allen Bernero. This episode marks the final appearance of Meredith Monroe as Haley Hotchner, although Monroe reprised her role for one more time in the Season 9 episode \\"Route 66\\". At the time of its initial release, the episode was watched by 13.61 million viewers and received positive reviews with the television critics praising Thomas Gibson's performance. Plot In the beginning, the BAU team members are being interviewed individually by Section Chief Erin Strauss (Jayne Atkinson) for an internal investigation concerning Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson). George Foyet a.k.a. \\"The Reaper\\" (C. Thomas Howell) had been corresponding with Karl Arnold while the latter was in prison. The team discovers Foyet became dependent on medications after he'd stabbed himself repeatedly. When a pharmacist explains to JJ (A. J. Cook) that one allergy medication could be replaced with another, JJ figures out there must be certain medications that Foyet takes that cannot be substituted. After discovering where the letters originated, Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) starts to create anagrams for \\"The Reaper\\" to figure out the alias Foyet may be using, and he comes up with the name \\"Peter Rhea.\\" Narrowing down the addresses on the letters along with the name and the probable name Foyet would use to pick up his medication, the team thinks they've pinpointed Foyet's location. They surround the apartment and knock on the door, but when there is no answer, the team goes in. There is a large stack of mail near the door that indicates Foyet hasn't been around in awhile. Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) takes a look at the laptop in the home and discovers Foyet had set up an internet alert for Peter Rhea, which meant he would be alerted when anyone did a search on the name. In the home, there are also photos of Sam Kassmeyer (D. B. Sweeney), the U.S. Marshal assigned to protect Hotch's ex-wife, Haley (Meredith Monroe), and son, Jack (Cade Owens). The team goes to the safe house, and they find Sam Kassmeyer seriously injured, shot by Foyet. Sam apologizes to Hotch, and it is revealed that Foyet had stolen Sam's cell phone and repeatedly called random numbers on the speed dial until he reached Haley. On the phone, he pretended to be a marshal and detailed to a terrified Haley that both Kassmeyer and Hotch were dead, so Haley and the new marshal needed to meet at her home. The mortally wounded Sam Kassmeyer dies in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Meanwhile, Hotch calls Foyet on his cell phone and threatens him repeatedly. Foyet responds that Haley looks good with dark hair. Haley, believing Foyet is the new marshal assigned to protect her and Jack, lets him into the house. During a frantic drive to his own house, Hotch calls Haley and speaks with Foyet. Foyet tells Haley how her ex-husband broke their deal by still trying to track him down. Therefore, he has to kill Hotch's family in retaliation. Hotch informs Jack that he needs to help his dad work the case, and so Jack goes upstairs. Haley tells Hotch he needs to tell his son how they met so Jack would still believe in love. Foyet shoots her three times as Hotch and the rest of the team listen on the phone. Hotch arrives at his house, enters, and discovers bloody footprints leading up the stairs. He finds Haley's body lying on the floor and sees a figure hiding behind the curtains. Hotch empties a clip into the hidden figure, who turns out to be Foyet wearing a bullet-proof vest. Foyet falls to the floor and the two men fight. Hotch beats Foyet to death, even after Foyet surrenders. The rest of the team arrives. Morgan (Shemar Moore), Prentiss (Paget Brewster) and Rossi (Joe Mantegna) check upstairs and find Hotch still beating Foyet, causing Morgan to have to pull Hotch away from Foyet. Hotch goes to check on Jack, who had helped his dad work the case by hiding in a chest ‚Äì their secret plan designed to protect Jack. At the end of the internal investigation, the panel rules that Agent Hotchner's actions were acceptable under the circumstances. Production The writer of this episode, Bo Crese, is actually an anagram used in the credits of \\"100\\". It is an anagram formed with the first letter of the name of every writer who contributed to the script: Breen Frazier, Oanh Ly, Chris Mundy, Rick Dunkle, Erica Messer, Simon Mirren and Edward Allen Bernero. This was used because each writer wrote a section of the episode. In an early draft of the script for this episode, Hotchner was written to kill George Foyet with his own knife. However, Edward Allen Bernero and Thomas Gibson believed the scene would be more powerful if Hotch used his bare hands. Speaking about the 100th episode, showrunner Edward Allen Bernero said he wanted to revisit a question that was raised in the pilot of Criminal Minds > \\"There's a question raised in the pilot episode of whether you can spend > your time hunting monsters and not become a monster. We wanted to revisit > that question 100 episodes later and see if the answer changed. Hotch does > something that makes you wonder what's happened to everybody [since the > start].\\" Reception =Ratings= The episode aired on CBS on November 25, 2009. Upon initial release, it was viewed by 13.61 million people and it also garnered a 3.2 Nielsen rating. \\"100\\" was also the week's third most watched drama and ranked tenth on the list of most watched television programmes overall. =Critical response= \\"100\\" was met with positive reviews. The episode has received an average score of 7.3 out of 10 in IMDb. Anthony Ocasio from Screen Rant gave the episode a positive review, saying that it \\"had me sitting on the edge of my seat the entire way\\" and said the scene with the Reaper, Haley and Jack was \\"the most intense thing I‚Äôve seen all year\\". CliqueClack praised Gibson's performance, saying that it \\"was a stunning performance by Gibson that cements his legacy as a top-tier actor\\".

The nonprofit was constituted in 2012. PILF asserts that \\"large numbers of ineligible aliens are registering to vote and casting ballots\\", although lists that they have displayed of such supposed voters prove to actually include American natives who are eligible voters. PILF said their lists had been based on state government lists of declared ‚Äúnon-citizens‚Äù removed from local voter rolls, but some U.S. citizens were wrongfully purged in the process. The group has made false claims about the extent of voter fraud in the United States, and the organization has published the information of eligible voters online, including Social Security numbers, falsely accusing them of being fraudulent voters.  Activities  The Public Interest Legal Foundation was established in 2012. The organization is a 501(c)(3) non-profit American corporation currently based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The group has been involved in legal cases in Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Nevada, Virginia, Kansas, D.C., and Mississippi. The organization has filed documents in favor of a Florida law barring ex-convicts who owe fines from voting. PILF has also participated as a primary party or intervenor in the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The organization also submits amicus curiae briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court on election-related issues. PILF has sent mailings to hundreds of counties claiming that their voting rolls are provably corrupt; Politifact has judged these claims to be \\"false\\", stating that \\"inactive\\" registrants should not be counted with \\"active\\" ones when calculating total rates of voter registration. The foundation originally flagged jurisdictions with more registered voters than resident adults, according to annual U.S. Census population estimates at the time. ProPublica found major counting errors in PlLF's use of government data; PlLF subsequently corrected its analysis. In 2016 and 2017, the organization published the information of eligible voters online, including Social Security numbers, falsely accusing them of being fraudulent voters. One such voter was a U.S. missionary in Guatemala whom, based on PILF's report, was inaccurately highlighted as a fraudulent voter in a Washington Times article. In 2018, the Richmond Council for the League of United Latin American Citizens and four individual voters filed a federal lawsuit, LULAC of Richmond v. Public Interest Legal Foundation, in the Eastern District of Virginia against the PILF for these false reports. The lawsuit claimed violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act and the Voting Rights Act, as well as state defamation laws. The plaintiffs were successful. Organization The organization's current president and general counsel is J. Christian Adams, an American attorney and conservative activist formerly employed by the United States Department of Justice under the George W. Bush administration. Adams has described those who say there is no comprehensive proof of systemic voter fraud as \\"flat- earthers\\", and opposes automatic voter registration, saying that voter registration should require \\"forethought and initiative, something lacking in large segments of the Democrat base.\\" In 2017 Adams was chosen by President Donald Trump to be a member of his Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. Director Hans von Spakovsky is an American attorney and a former member of the Federal Election Commission (FEC). He is the manager of the Heritage Foundation's Election Law Reform Initiative and a senior legal fellow in Heritage's Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies. He is an advocate for more restrictive voting laws. He has been described as playing an influential role in making alarmism about voter fraud mainstream in the Republican Party, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud. His work claiming voting fraud is rampant has been discredited. In 2017 President Donald J. Trump named him to be a member of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. Example legal actions In 2018 PILF sued Harris County, Texas, Tax Assessor-Collector and Voter Registrar Ann Bennett alleging violations of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The complaint claimed Bennett‚Äôs office refused access to records of registered voters identified as noncitizens and what actions the office had taken in regard to these registrations. The lawsuit was settled in March of 2020, allowing PILF access to the records. In December 2019, PILF filed a lawsuit against the City of Detroit, claiming that the city failed to maintain voter registration records as required by federal and state laws. The suit was dropped in July of 2020 after actions by Detroit Clerk Janice Winfrey and Elections Director George Azzouz to review and remove likely deceased registrants on a list provided by the plaintiff. In February 2020, PILF sued Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap for alleged violation of the Public Disclosure Provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The complaint claims Dunlap's office illegally denied the group access to the state‚Äôs list of registered voters, preventing full public access and monitoring of the rolls as provided by Public Disclosure Provision of the act. State law enumerates those who the list is to be made available to, including to organizations specifically involved in \\"get out the vote\\" efforts. The suit states that they were denied the list due to not being involved in such efforts. Also in February 2020, PILF sued Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, alleging violations of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 for not making a \\"reasonable effort\\" to remove the names of ineligible voters from its voter registration rolls. In December of 2019, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale found in an audit of the county's voter rolls that about 42,000 active records should have been placed into inactive status because of five years of inactivity. In August 2020, PILF filed a lawsuit against Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for failing to act on a request to disclose voting records related to the 2018 General Election from the City of Southfield, MI. The Foundation sought records of 193 allegedly altered voter history files from November 2018 that led to six felony charges against Southfield City Clerk Sherikia Hawkins for voiding absentee ballots.

Women during the War for Independence (1961-1991)  Welcome to Eritrea Eritrean women represented 30 percent of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) during the 30-year war for independence. The war was fought against Ethiopian forces to reestablish Eritrean sovereignty from Ethiopian annexation. Eritrea was annexed on 15 November 1962, following pressure from Haile Selassie I on the Eritrean Assembly,[6] the Federation was officially dissolved and Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia directly after. With this annexation Eritrea's national language was changed to Amharic and they would now be considered a part of the Ethiopian state. The struggle for independence accelerated promptly after annexation and the war would continue for 30 years. By the end of the 30 year long struggle, women comprised about one third of the military force of 95,000. Up to 30,000 women fighters began new lives during the conflict. (Iyob 1997), The women fighters would serve alongside men in every capacity. The war ended in 1991, and independence was officially achieved in 1993. The emancipation of women was central to the cultural revolution advocated by the EPLF and their Marxist‚ÄìLeninist ideology, within its own ranks the Front attempted to put gender equality into practice during the 30-year war. Areas that were consolidated by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front from Ethiopian hegemony were the epicenter of this cultural revolution. In these areas they attempted to reform traditional Ethiopian marriage practices like forced marriage, arranged marriage, the payment of dowry, child marriage and the marginalization of non virgin brides. The EPLF conceptualized marriage as the partnership of a man and woman who are each free individuals exercising choice. In the EPLF's words this was described as \\"democratic marriage\\" (Silkin 1989:148) and as \\"marriages based solely on comradely love\\" (Eritrean Women's Association 1979:18). The EPLF also provided fighters with contraceptives, which were not provided in traditional Ethiopian society. Women in the EPLF exercised choice both in starting relationships and ending them which was not the norm in rural and traditional Ethiopian society in the 1960s. EPLF fighters reported that divorce was easy, common and often initiated by the women during the War. What was usually regarded as scandalous promiscuity based on traditional ideas of purity and virginity, were tolerated in the Eritrean People's Liberation Front's liberated areas. The role of the female fighter during the 30 year War for Independence challenged normative gendered stereotypes and gender roles. Women in conflict are often solely perceived as victims, often suffering from rape and being portrayed as defenseless and inactive during these periods. These gendered portrayal of defenseless women in war were thoroughly deconstructed during the war, with the Eritrean women forces being at the forefront of this conflict. This opened up opportunities to reconstruct ‚Äògiven‚Äô gendered stereotypes by directly challenging them. The assumption that women are inherently more peaceful than men neglects the other roles and behaviors that women can assume as people that naturally have varying degrees of aggressiveness and assertiveness. The breaking down of gender roles and stereotypes was important for creating healthy social conditions for women. Gendered images of women as inferior, less capable, submissive, emotional, less intelligent and docile and portrayals of men as superior, more competent, dominant, rational, and intelligent may breed the grounds for sexist assumptions that are reproduced in society and become detrimental to women who have to deal with these assumptions on a daily basis. (NW, All) Division of Labor Eritrea is an agricultural subsistence society, both men and women work in agriculture and gendered divisions of labour exists in these practices. They depend on a regional agrarian system. Pastoralist and semi-pastoralist areas in the lowlands are dependent on livestock breeding. Women's role is centered on processing and preparing food as well as milking of goats and cows. In most areas farming is the mainstay, men and women work in the fields and share agricultural work in the communal land of Eritrea. In addition to this, women are involved in backyard gardening, poultry and beekeeping as well as weaving. In most regions, women are responsible for most aspects of child care in their household. In the central highlands both men and women work in the fields. However ploughing remains a male practice, while hoeing and weeding is shared by both men and women. In some areas men and women produce the same crops but have separate fields, for subsistence and for sale. There are also separate tasks within the cropping cycle, with men planting cereals and fodder crops together with vegetables, while women plant some varieties of vegetables. In livestock production men tend the livestock, while women do the milking. In Africa, women are assumed to perform 65% of the work for food production, in Eritrea the rate is 70% - 80%. Women also provide the labour for 80% of the food storage and transport from farm to the home, 90% of hoeing and weeding, and 60% of harvesting and marketing. Women also work in the fields of their husbands, weeding, hoeing, transporting and storing, while men plough women's field. Men do most of the fishing in the Red Sea while women make up 50% of the workforce in beach seining. Women also contribute to the harvesting of fisheries resources, such as catching small pelagic fish, collecting sea snails for the incense and perfume production in Yemen and other Arab countries. Eritrean women work much longer hours than men, which is corroborated by numerous studies of gender roles and responsibilities, women in Eritrea reported that they commonly work up to 9 hours a day during the cropping season. In the field of education women represent 50 percent of all elementary school teachers in the country. Which is an even ratio from men to women. This number drops significantly to 10 percent for middle and secondary schools in Eritrea. This arises because women's secondary education is hindered by cultural expectation of raising a family at a young age. Many women stop schooling during their secondary education which prohibits them from having the educational requirements to teach the secondary level of school. Although this number is low, efforts are being made to increase this statistic and allow women more access to education while supporting their family. Women and men are paid equally for their jobs as elementary and secondary school teachers. (Nolan White, All) School in Asmara =Education= While the current government maintains a dedicated stance on girls‚Äô education, the historical legacy of male and female education is difficult with certain cultural attitudes and practices still pervasive in Eritrean society. Many Eritrean women in isolated and rural areas are expected to work in agriculture and maintain domestic responsibilities in early adulthood. UNICEF reports only 43 percent of girls are enrolled in primary school education. While 50 percent of boys are enrolled. Enrollment in secondary school is much lower with about 25 percent of girls enrolled and 32 percent of boys. Although educational access decreases the literacy rates in Eritrea is high with women at 87.7 percent compared to men at 92.6 percent. The percent of women in education is steadily rising. Women at Eritrean wedding A decade ago, only 25 percent of university graduates were women. Today that number ranges between 40 and 50 percent, depending on the institution and the field of study. In Eritrea it is believed that early marriage secures more children. On the other hand, an unmarried female can be considered as a burden to the collective family and societal structure. Families in rural areas expect there daughters to get married early sometimes before the age of 18 years old. The average distance for elementary, middle and secondary school levels is contributing to the low education enrollment for women. At a national level, on average students are required to travel 5.3 km at elementary school level, 21.76 km at middle school level and 63.53 km at secondary school level. Schools are not close to students‚Äô homes or villages and the average distance increases with the increase in the level of schooling (elementary school, middle school, secondary school). The reason for this is due to a lack of schools particularly middle and secondary schools being built in more remote areas of Eritrea. An Eritrean girl must travel a long distance, or either, leave home to live in a rented house or with relatives outside the family village. This is hard for girls who are generally not allowed to travel long distances or rent houses in the urban areas to continue their education for safety reasons. Distance to the schools is a major barrier to girls education in Eritrea. Women represent about 50% of all teachers in elementary-level schools, and about 10% of all teachers at middle and secondary-level schools.https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/3-ways-increase-girls- education-eritrea (Nolan White, All) Marriage Almost 40 percent of women in Eritrea are married by their 21st birthday. Limited access to education is associated with the high prevalence of child marriage in Eritrea. 64% of women aged 20‚Äì24 with no education and 53% with primary education were married by 21 years old, compared to just 12% of women with secondary education or higher. The Eritrean Civil Code (articles 329 and 581) sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 years for both girls and boys although this is the case because of social norms women still get married at younger ages. This makes it difficult for women to pursue higher education because they are expected to work in subsistence agriculture and prepare food for their family at a young age.(Nolan White, All) References ","title":"Women in Eritrea"},{"id":"58621241","text":"Margoni is a surname.

It was designed by George Sydney Jones & Harry Thompson and built from 1889 to 1890 by Thomas Hanley of Balmain. It is also known as Trinity Congregational Church. The property is owned by the Uniting Church in Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 September 2003.  History  Trinity Church was formed from a split within the congregation of the Congregational Church in Burwood which itself had begun from an inter- denominational fellowship which met in a small weatherboard building on the Parramatta Road from 1861. Of the original church of 1866 only part of the Sunday School remains as it was burnt down in 1874. It was replaced by a stone church in 1880. There was a group at the Burwood church who became disenchanted with the set-up there and so, on Sunday 5 May 1889 a number of church members, together with the Rev George Littlemore, Burwood's former pastor, met for worship in the Burwood School of Arts. Subsequently 48 people enrolled in the congregation of Trinity Church. However, two of the secessionists were wealthy men, Dr Philip Sydney Jones and the tobacco merchant George Todman, who could not agree on a site for a new church, so they built one each. Thus Strathfield came to acquire two Congregational Churches at the same time - Trinity and Strathfield. Land for the new Trinity Church was either purchased or otherwise acquired on the corner of The Boulevarde and Morwick Street reputedly by the generosity of Dr P Sydney Jones (later Sir Philip Sydney Jones of Llandilo, Strathfield). Sir Phillip's younger brother, George, and brother-in-law, Harry Thomson, were the joint architects. George had served for a period in the offices of John Horbury Hunt. The level of detailing in the brickwork of the church may have been influenced by Hunt, but the overall design is much more Victorian in style. The Foundation Stone was laid on 2 November 1889 and the Dedication Ceremony on 26 January 1890. The builder was Thomas Hanley of Balmain and the cost of the new church was A‚Ç§1,449. Gifts given to the church included a set of pulpit robes and communion plate given by the ladies of the congregation. The carpets and draperies were given by Edward Jones, brother of Sir Phillip, whose father was David Jones of department store fame. The Norman and Beard (London) organ given by the Thompson family (J D & H D) bought in England during a visit there by JD in 1909. The Congregation continued to grow and was served by a succession of able Ministers up until 1962 when, due to declining numbers, the congregation was no longer able to support its own Minister. A joint arrangement was made with Summer Hill. When Summer Hill Church closed Trinity became part of the Mid-Western Suburbs Group of Trinity, Strathfield-Homebush, Concord and Croydon. In 1977 this group became part of the Uniting Church of Australia.Design 5 Architects  Description  =Church= Victorian Romanesque church built in polychrome brick, red with blond patterning on the exterior, and the reverse, blond with red detailing on the interior. The cruciform plan of the church is extended vertically through the spirelet over the crossing. The church is oriented east-west, with the main entry at the western end through an attached porch (exonarthex). A secondary entrance is through the north transept. Small dark stained timber vestibules with stained glass doors provide protected entry on the inside of the church. The building is elaborately decorated both externally and internally. Contrasting brickwork is used for attached pilasters, buttresses, quoining around window and door openings, string courses and coloureds bands of brickwork, and diamond panels in the facework. Contrasting moulded bricks are used for string courses, sills and hood moulds. Generally, windows and doors have semicircular heads. Ogee hood moulds appear over the two entries to the church. The main roof is currently terra cotta Marseilles pattern tiles, but may have originally been slate. The roof over the vestry is colorbond. Roof over the western entrance porch is painted corrugated gal steel. The spire is octagonal, of timber construction, with louvred vents and clad in sheet metal (copper or zinc). The floor is timber, sloping down from the west door toward the crossing, with a carpet down the aisle. The floor is flat through the transepts. The chancel/sanctuary is on a raised platform, carpeted. The walls of the nave and transepts have a rendered dado (recent) with a timber dado rail. The dado to the sanctuary and the south transept has velvet curtains hanging in front of white lime washed brickwork. The ceiling is diagonally boarded with exposed trusses and purlins, and triangular ceiling vents. The structure of the spire is supported by the four roof trusses over the crossing, and is open through the ceiling for light and ventilation. Internally, the emphasis is on the crossing, with the pews arranged around the centre. The pews are original with bench seats and shaped slatted backs. Fold down seats exist on the ends of some pews. The pulpit and lectern and other sanctuary furniture appear to be original. A pipe organ occupies the south transept. It retains its original hand pump handle to the bellows. The church contains a fine collection of leadlight windows, featuring floral themes, and memorials. The building also retains its original gas light fittings. =Hall= The hall has been built in several stages, with each stage being designed to complement the church. Generally, the building is of polychrome brickwork, red with blond trim, with a terra cotta Marseilles pattern tiled roof, hipped in form with skillion additions. A gabled entrance porch has been added to the west elevation. Windows are double hung with semicircular heads and contrasting brick quoins and sills. Internally, the floor is timber, except the toilet addition, which is concrete. The walls are rendered with a dado line run in the render. The ceiling is of battened sheets. A large stage exists at the northern end of the hall, but has been partitioned off and converted to offices. The original steps and doors to the wings still exist, as does one wing wall (stud frame lined one side only). When the addition was made to the north-west corner of the building the original window to the hall was relocated to the north wall of the addition. = Condition = As at 30 May 2003, the church is generally good. Evidence of falling damp and salt attack in the north-east corner of the vestry. Recent works have been carried out to the roof drainage over this area. The rendering of the dado inside the church may be due to rising damp. This should be investigated. Timberwork to spire is in need of painting. Hall: Generally good. The church has a very high degree of integrity. = Modifications and dates = *1909 - organ purchased *1932 - Hall built *1940s? - Low wall and gates built to street boundaries *1961 - Office addition to south-west corner of hall *s - Toilet addition to eastern end of hall. = Further information = The group of buildings is very cohesive in design, with the hall adopting the polychrome detailing of the church, but with the church remaining the dominant building on the site in both scale, location and level of detail. The church and hall are no longer used by a congregation of the Uniting Church of Australia for regular Sunday worship, but the Strathfield-Homebush parish uses one room as its central church office, and occasionally uses the church for special services. The church is leased to 3 other congregations for worship services, and the hall is leased for the offices of other religious organisations and for community use.  Heritage listing  As at 30 May 2003, Trinity Uniting Church constructed in 1889 is an exceptionally fine and intact example of Victorian Romanesque design, with excellent polychrome brickwork detailing, both externally and internally. The cruciform plan of the church is extended vertically through the spirelet over the crossing. The church contains a fine collection of leadlight windows, original furnishings, original gas light fittings and a pipe organ (1909) by the London firm of Norman and Beard. The intactness and exceptional aesthetic significance of this place make it State significant. The church is associated with the Jones family, prominent and wealthy members of the Sydney community - Sir Philip Sydney Jones and his brother Edward Jones, whose father was David Jones of department store fame, contributed financially to the establishment of the church. Sir Phillip's younger brother, George, and brother-in-law, Harry P Thomson, were the joint architects. Trinity Uniting Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 September 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The place was built following a split within the congregation of the Congregational Church of Burwood in 1889. A second splinter group from the same church at the same time built the Strathfield Congregational Church. These two congregations were reunited in 1977 under the Uniting Church of Australia. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The church is associated with the Jones family, prominent and wealthy members of the Sydney community - Sir Philip Sydney Jones and his brother Edward Jones, whose father was David Jones of department store fame, contributed financially to the establishment of the church. Sir Phillip's younger brother, George, and brother-in-law, Harry P Thomson, were the joint architects. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The cruciform plan of the church is extended vertically through the spirelet over the crossing. The church contains a fine collection of leadlight windows, original furnishings, original gas light fittings and a pipe organ by the London firm of Norman and Beard. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place is significant as a place of worship to the several congregations that use it. With the formation of the Uniting Church of Australia in 1977, the former Trinity congregation moved to Strathfield Uniting Church, leasing Trinity to several young congregations, representing the various cultural groups within the Strathfield area. Strathfield-Homebush Uniting Church Parish maintains a continuing presence using and office daily and the church occasionally. The hall provides facilities for community use. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Trinity Uniting Church is a rare example of an elaborate Victorian Romanesque suburban church featuring polychrome brick detailing externally, with the reverse colour way expressed internally. The detailing throughout is of a very high standard. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It is representative of the rapid expansion of the churches during the second half of the nineteenth century and of the money spent on new church buildings by wealthy and powerful families during the Victorian era.

It was designed by Howlett and Bailey in 1962 and built from 1963 to 1965 by Civil & Civic. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  On 13 January 1913 the Savings Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank opened for business in Canberra. A week later the Savings Bank Department and General Banking commenced operations. Both departments occupied a room in the Administrative Offices in Acton. In October 1913, the Commonwealth Bank moved into its own premises, erected by the Department of Home Affairs, in Acton. In June 1925 the Chairman of the Federal Capital Commission raised the question of permanent premises for the Commonwealth Bank in Canberra. The proposal received a positive response from the Commonwealth Bank Board in July 1925 and the Deputy Governor visited Canberra to consider suitable sites. In April 1926, the Commonwealth Bank acquired the lease for the site on the western side of Northbourne Avenue and the corner of City Circuit (now London Circuit) for . Each leaseholder had to erect a building in accordance with the design of the Federal Capital Commission. Tenders for the Commonwealth Bank's new premises closed in November 1926 with Simmie and Co being the successful contractor at . The Commonwealth Bank moved into its new premises (part of the Melbourne Building) in October 1927. When the Reserve Bank of Australia separated from the Commonwealth Bank, it continued to occupy space on the first floor of the Commonwealth Bank premises. The working conditions were very cramped and the Reserve Bank, almost immediately, began negotiations with the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) to find a suitable site for its own premises. The NCDC at first offered the Reserve Bank a site on the south western side of Northbourne Avenue and London Circuit but later withdrew this offer because of perceived traffic problems. The NCDC then offered the Reserve Bank a site on London Circuit near the intersection with University Avenue. This site was opposite a proposed commercial precinct and was an integral part of a legal precinct. The Reserve Bank agreed to accept the site in May 1961 and applied for a 99 year lease, commencing on 1 May 1962 at a rental of 5% of the unimproved capital value of the land. The lease was subject to review every 20 years. Although the NCDC would not permit an architectural competition for the corner site on Northbourne Avenue, there was no objection to a competition for the legal precinct site, notwithstanding the fact that NCDC imposed height and bulk conditions in the lease. The Canberra Branch of the Reserve Bank is the result of an architectural competition, approved by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA). The National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) managed the competition to the requirements of the Reserve Bank. The competition was advertised on 13 December 1961 and closed on 16 April 1962. It required a building to front London Circuit, but with all elevations of equal importance. Other design and siting requirements included the building having: a ground floor and two upper floors with the height not to exceed RL 1902; a copper roof; all plant contained within the building; air conditioning and heating using smokeless fuel; suitable landscaping; no underground accommodation. The Reserve Bank required the following accommodation: a banking chamber on the ground floor with a and up to counter; working space of , and a public space the full length of the counter. The manager's room was to be and the assistant manager's room . Also required was a cash handling area of and a strong room with walls, floor and roof thick. The climatic conditions of Canberra required special attention and the total cost was not to exceed . There were 131 submissions from 248 registrations, and the assessors: Professor Ingham Ashworth, (Sydney); Professor R A Jensen (Adelaide); and Mr Grenfell Ruddick (NCDC Associate Commissioner) reported that the response was \\"extremely disappointing\\" with the majority of the schemes lacking \\"architectural distinction\\". Another complaint was that the schemes were \\"totally unsuited for the site in question\\". The assessors report noted that \\"the most successful schemes were those based on a simple rectangular form\\". The winning architects were Howlett and Bailey of Perth. Tenders for construction eventually closed in July 1963 with the successful tenderers being Civil & Civic with a quotation of , some more than the competition limit. Construction was commenced in 1963 and completed in 1965. The artwork in the banking chamber was initially sculpted by Margo Lewers in 1965 to a design by Gerald Lewers. This work was originally untitled but has since been referred to as \\"Four Pieces\\". Cast in copper, it occupies the major part of the wall, high on the southern side of the banking chamber. Another major sculpture was a free standing aluminium and fibreglass figure by Donald Brook, also \\"Untitled\\". This was installed in 1965 in the roof garden but was removed when the atrium was converted to office accommodation and now resides with the Canberra Museum and Art Gallery. Throughout the life of the building changes have been made to the structure and fabric of the building and services upgrading has occurred as technological change exerted its influence. Maintenance work occurred in 1972, 1977 and in 1978 the telephone, lighting and electrical services were upgraded. The Department of Works made internal alterations and additions in September 1978 and replaced the external mosaic tiles with marble cladding in April 1981. The Department of Transport and Construction supervised a major refurbishment for the building in 1983 including redesign of the ground and first floor in January 1983, a refurbishment of the entrance canopies in February 1983, upgraded ground and first floor toilets in May 1983, and new mechanical services in August 1983. In October 1988, the Department of Housing and Construction designed a roof replacement and internal refurbishment. The principal result of all these alterations and additions was the infilling of the atrium to provide additional accommodation and the redesign of the cash handling area as that function changed. Further alterations occurred in 1994 to convert surplus accommodation for letting to tenants. This work included refurbishment of the independent entrance on the northern side of the building with a granite floor, a marble, granite and stainless steel stair, a skylight over, and the partitioning of the first floor space into offices. Alterations to the buildings in recent years illustrate a change towards a cashless society. The original building design reflects the money-handling nature of banking in a cash-oriented society. The design of the Reserve Bank and its operation centred on the receipt and distribution of cash. The careful arrangements for receiving cash in a secure cash handling area, the location of the strong room in the centre of the building, the bold, wide (but carefully uncluttered) public counter together with the scale and overwhelming impressiveness of the banking chamber were all meant to give a real sense of security as well as provide a perception of the significance and importance of the role of the Reserve Bank in the Australian banking system. The Reserve Bank building was the second building after the Law Courts of the ACT to be constructed in the legal precinct near the intersection of University Avenue and London Circuit. The third and last building making up the civic design group that terminated University Avenue was the Federal Police Headquarters. The design of the precinct reflects the important civic design principles being implemented by the National Capital Development Commission and the way in which these can be achieved by offering suitable sites to public institutions. The civic design status of University Avenue as one of Canberra's major axes terminating at Civic Hill had been established with the construction of buildings such as the ANZ Bank building in the Hobart Place commercial precinct.  Description  View of the building with signange, 2009 The Reserve Bank of Australia building is at 20-22 London Circuit, Canberra. The Reserve Bank is a most pleasing proportioned structure built of enduring and handsome materials in a most prestigious precinct. The building is a low scale example of a modernist structure where the overall impression is one of regular structural fineness and tight details. The architectural qualities of the design rely on the lightness of the structure, the regular structural pattern, the contrast between the marble-faced columns and beams and the glazing. The attention to detail is precise and is expressed in the way the vertical and horizontal structural elements connect and the subtle spacing of the structure from the glazed curtain wall accommodation box behind. The articulated structure, regular elevation pattern and the minimal visual impact of the roof are typical features of the modernist functional style. The vertical emphasis of the columns extending over two levels to give the low rise building a sense of height is most effective. The columns are cruciform in plan and support a beam carefully separated from the column. The glazed curtain wall is supported on the beam and uses aluminium mullions. The very strong, blank wall of the secure ground floor cash handling area on the external south eastern side of the building is another powerful reminder of its modernist qualities where the internal function gains external expression. Internally the most important space is the banking chamber. It is a symmetrical design with a central entrance under a canopy with black slate entrance floor, converting into carpet once inside the room. The carpet is not the original fabric. In the south eastern corner of the banking chamber there is a glazed entrance to offices through a timber and georgian wired glass partition with the door matching the partition design. In the centre of the eastern wall there is an entrance to the strong room. From the public side, the folded and wrapped copper abstract Gerald Lewers sculpture \\"Untitled\\" ('Four Pieces') and the matt black ribbed wall on which it is fixed dominate the room. Another noticeable feature is the banking counter, a most handsome piece of furniture with a laminated timber front and a marble top, sitting on dowel metal legs. The interior is light and airy as a result of the full height glazing on three sides of the room. The glazing has had to be screened because of the effect of sunlight. The ceiling is coffered and the wall under the sculpture is marble-faced. The banking chamber is a most important space and its historic fabric and built in furniture described contribute to its significance. The strong room is entered through a glass sliding door from the banking chamber. The strong room door is by John Tam (Australia) and has an anchor motif. The space is divided into areas by metal grills, the floor is parquet. The strong room is important for the way it is designed as the hub of the building and for its significant fabric and form of design reflecting the cash handling nature of the way society and banking operated at the time. The courtyard onto which the three buildings face had been constructed as a setting for the Law Courts and at the time of the opening of the Reserve Bank the Federal Police Headquarters were under construction. The design and siting controls of the NCDC meant that the Reserve Bank would fit comfortably in scale with the existing Law Courts and the use of marble facing and flat roof profile created a sympathetic physical connection between the precinct elements. The Law Courts building with its black columns and white marble walls was almost a negative of the dark curtain wall and white marble columns of the Reserve Bank. The marble cladding has replaced original mosaic tiles. The courtyard materials with pre-cast light grey exposed aggregate paving and black slate rectangles reinforced the \\"colour coded\\" nature of the precinct. = Condition = The building design has been modified by the addition of sunscreens to the exposed glass areas, which has reduced the intended transparency of the banking chamber. The mosaic tiling has been replaced by marble cladding.  Heritage listing  The Reserve Bank of Australia building was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The Reserve Bank is important as the nation's central bank having evolved from the separation of the central banking (monetary policy) function from the commercial, customer focussed activities of the Commonwealth Bank. Criterion D: Characteristic values It is one of three buildings in the precinct, demonstrating the Stripped Classical style of architecture with their typical features such as simple rectangular forms, echoes of colonnades, symmetry and horizontal skyline, all linked by a landscape plaza also expressing a geometric minimalist style. The sculptural work in the Reserve Bank, by Gerald and Margo Lewers demonstrates the sculptural styles of the times and the role of art to adorn public places. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics The aesthetic importance of the Reserve Bank building which links harmoniously with the precinct, is created by the elegance of its minimalist design style, the low scale and simple building form, and the use of pale grey marble cladding which provides a light visual quality. The location of the bank in the precinct, being visual subservient to the former Law Courts building, enhances the latter's projection of authority and dignity. The Reserve Bank contributes enframement to visual axis of the Black Mountain vista. Criterion F: Technical achievement The Reserve Bank of Australia building, constructed 1963 -65, is a major component of the Law Courts Precinct. The precinct provides a noteworthy contribution to Canberra's townscape by its siting as a terminating point for University Avenue at City Hill, its arrangement of buildings giving prominence to the Supreme Court, and its design execution in the contemporary modern design idiom. The design of the Reserve Bank is additionally important for its overall impression of institutional security. The impressive space of its banking chamber makes full use of the building's height and proportions. Design features of the chamber are the sculpture, \\"Four Pieces\\" by Gerald and Margo Lewers, and the timber counter and furniture contemporary with the design of the building.

It was described in 2016 by researchers of the Mayo Clinic in the United States.Boyan Fang el al., Autoimmune Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Astrocytopathy. A Novel Meningoencephalomyelitis, November 2016, JAMA Neurol. 2016;73(11):1297-1307. GFAP is an intermediate filament (IF) protein that is expressed by numerous cell types of the central nervous system (CNS) including astrocytes. The destruction of astrocytes can lead to the development of a glial scar. There are multiple disorders associated with improper GFAP regulation and glial scarring is a consequence of several neurodegenerative conditions. The scar is formed by astrocytes interacting with fibrous tissue to re-establish the glial margins around the central injury core and is partially caused by up-regulation of GFAP. Signs and symptoms The reported symptoms are:Y. Long et al., Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein astrocytopathy in Chinese patients: a retrospective study, 29 November 2017, https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.13531 * myelitis (68.4%) * headache (63.2%) * abnormal vision (63.2%) * fever (52.6%) * ataxia (36.8%) * psychosis (31.6%) * dyskinesia (15.8%) * dementia (15.8%) * seizure (10.5%) Under MRI these patients show a characteristic radial enhancing and laminar patterns. In an early report, most patients had brain abnormalities (89.5%), of which eight (42.1%) revealed the characteristic radial enhancing and laminar patterns. Cortical abnormalities were found in one-fifth of patients (21.1%). Other abnormalities were found in the hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla cerebellum, meninges, and skull. Eleven patients had longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions. CSF abnormalities were detected in all patients. Clinical courses GFAP autoimmunity comprises a spectrum of presentations of meningoencephalomyelitis. Specifically, some courses can be described as relapsing autoimmune meningoencephalomyelitis. Seropositivity distinguishes autoimmune GFAP meningoencephalomyelitis from disorders commonly considered in the differential diagnosis. The clinical presentations include:Iorio R, Damato V, Evoli A, et al, Clinical and immunological characteristics of the spectrum of GFAP autoimmunity: a case series of 22 patients, J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2018;89:138-146. * meningoencephalomyelitis * encephalitis * movement disorder (choreoathetosis or myoclonus) * anti-epileptic drugs (AED)-resistant epilepsy * cerebellar ataxia * myelitis * optic neuritis Some clinical courses could be coincident with neuromyelitis optica clinical cases. Causes The reason that anti-GFAP autoantibodies appear is currently unknown. There is the possibility that GFAP is not pathogenic, but just an unspecific biomarker of several heterogeneous CNS inflammations. According to this hypothesis, GFAP antibody itself does not induce pathological changes; it is only a biomarker for the process of immune inflammationShan F, Long Y, Qiu W.

It was designed by Charles Tiffin and built in 1865-1866. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  Situated on the Mary River, Maryborough was first settled in the late 1840s and is one of Queensland's oldest cities. Many settlers to the region also entered the Colony of Queensland through the Port of Maryborough in the nineteenth century. Wool was an early local export, with the original Maryborough site, occupied until 1855, located between the Bruce Highway and the Mary River. Maryborough was a thriving township when it was proclaimed a municipality in 1861. In 1865 the Maryborough Sugar Company was set up and, when gold was discovered in 1867 at Gympie, Maryborough became one of the major access points to the fields. The Maryborough Post Office was constructed in this thriving period (1865-66) to designs prepared by Colonial Architect, Charles Tiffin. The post office is the oldest post office known to survive in Queensland, and is one of three remaining masonry post offices from the period between Queensland's separation from New South Wales in 1859 and the amalgamation of the post and telegraph departments in 1878. The Maryborough Post Office and the Rockhampton Post Office were designed concurrently and, due to the high cost of building materials in Rockhampton, the tender for construction of Rockhampton Post Office was exceeded. This problem was allegedly solved by the exchange of the less expensive Maryborough design with Rockhampton's. The elevations for Maryborough Post Office refer to Denham and East Streets (in Rockhampton), rather than Bazaar and Wharf Streets. The building constructed in Maryborough (Rockhampton's design) was designed for an eastern orientation rather than a western orientation, and hence it lacked the appropriate sun shading. In 1869 a single faced clock, facing Wharf Street, was installed in the third level of the tower. The Wharf Street loggia was enclosed in 1875-77 by contractors J and J Rooney to increase accommodation and improve lighting and ventilation. A further storey was added to the corner tower in 1879-80, allowing the installation of a four dialled clock and bells, which was officially started on 9 December 1879 (the clock was dismantled in 1935). The first country telephone exchange was opened in Maryborough in November 1882, and a new wing constructed to house the expanding operation in 1885, as well as the enclosure of the Bazaar Street loggia. As a result of the enclosure of both loggias, the ground floor offices were not protected from the summer heat. This necessitated the construction of a corrugated iron awning supported by cast iron columns over the Bazaar Street footpath and the attachment of cast iron framed corrugated iron sunshades to the first floor level windows on both facades. In addition, a timber-framed balcony replaced the sunshades to the first floor level of the postmaster's quarters in 1896. Internal alterations were undertaken in 1906 and 1925, and a separate building for the telephone exchange was added in 1948. The building underwent further additions and alterations, including the reopening of the Bazaar Street loggia, during the 1950s and 1960s.Register of the National Estate The design and alterations were undertaken by the Colonial Architect's office under Charles Tiffin (1865-6); then FDG Stanley (1875-9, tower extension), JJ Clark (1882-5) and Alfred Barton Brady (1896-1906). The 1925 alterations may have been by the Australian Government under John Smith Murdoch's leadership. The alterations included: 1869 (clock); 1878 (loggia enclosure); 1879-80 (tower alterations); 1885 (alterations to Bazaar Street); 1886 (awning and sunshades); 1896 (balcony); 1906 (internal alterations); 1925 (internal alterations); 1948 (telephone exchange building); 1950s (extensions); 1979 (refurbishments).  Description  Maryborough Post Office, circa 1897 Maryborough Post Office is at 227 Bazaar Street, corner Wharf Street, Maryborough, comprising the whole of Lot 9 RP147687. Maryborough Post Office is at the corner of Bazaar and Wharf Streets, near the Mary River docks area and next door to the Law Courts, a Federation-era building, with Queens Park to its immediate north. The 1866-9 exterior was designed by Charles Tiffin, including the broad form of an astylar palazzo with each loggia in antis between flanking pavilions with layered arched windows on the ground floor. The loggia arches are supported on square columns with moulded springing points, suggesting a Tuscan order but not making any order explicit. The archivolts are moulded with strongly stated keystones supporting a flat- fronted course line. The ground-floor arches on the pavilions are double- layered with similar archivolt treatment to the arches in the loggias and recessed and surrounded by a second wall layer in cement-rendered brick. The upper level in Tiffin's design was composed of two recessed stories above each loggia framed by the first floors of each pavilion. The Bazaar Street side's north pavilion and the east pavilion on Wharf Street were marked on their first floors by a three-light window with two large masonry mullions with segmental brick arches. The corner pavilion has two arched windows in its first storey, with a recessed wall layer inside the arch framing two narrow arched windows with a roundel between their arches. Above that was a single storey extension to form a clock tower. This was separated from the first floor pavilion below by a dressed panel with a set of slots, and a coffered wall with a clock face inside the coffer facing Wharf Street, and a circular vent facing Bazaar Street. This level had a coffered frieze, boxed eave without bracketing, and a simple low-pitched pyramidal roof. Above this roof was a flagpole with a ball roof finial at its base. The chimneys were in plain masonry with a cornice, string course necking and broadened base. The windows were small-paned frames, in double-hung sashes on the first floor quarters elevations, broadened at the tower base into fully open arches; all upper windows on the Bazaar Street side now have heavily-scaled concave canopies. The 1878-9 alterations included a loggia enclosure, to add more rooms and gain better natural lighting. The tower was extended; the rear was also extended by about a third, and the north flanking bay was absorbed into the recessed elevation next to a new projecting wing. The Bazaar Street side was terminated by a new bay reproducing the old flanking pavilion in elevation, and a terminating bay of large door width flanked by two corners with rusticated quoins. The original hipped roof was replaced by a gable-hip. This arrangement needed more sun protection, so in 1886, during JJ Clark's term as Government Architect, the pavilions, tower and bays were then all linked by a deep sheltering verandah, carried on turned columns, rounded at the corner, with two low gables fronting its fascia directly in front of the corner tower bays. The tower's previous top level, housing the clock, was retained as a vented level with the circular vents of the original tower being carried all the way round, and with a new clock level including clock faces to all four sides, framed by an arch moulding carried on two squat pilasters flanked by a Corinthian column at each corner. The tower was then topped by an Italianate balustrade with waisted balusters. The original pyramidal roof and ball-based flagpole were not reinstated to the extended tower. In 1896, ten years after the ground floor verandah was added, a first floor balcony was added to the Wharf Street frontage sitting directly over the verandah roof. The Bazaar Street upper floor gained a coved roof hood as protection against western sun as well as a sunshade verandah form fronting the first floor drawing room. Subsequently, the loggia arches were closed over on the Wharf Street side, being replaced by double-hung sash windows and partly hidden by the awning. The open loggia form was retained on the Bazaar Street side, at least for the time being. On the Wharf Street side the former loggia spaces were reassigned to an extension of the post office hall and several new offices. There was still no internal toilet at this stage, and nor does one appear to have been planned. In 1906 the telephone exchange was moved to a new outer wing added at the rear, and there were corresponding resitings of the telegraph and telegraph manager's quarters. An extra bedroom was added at this point. From this work, too, came the opening of the double-layered arch at the clock tower base, to allow better access to the post office boxes inside. The concrete footings and the reinforced concrete floor may date from either this period or from the 1940s additions (see below). In 1925, probably under JS Murdoch's increasingly direct aegis, there was a resiting of internal function areas. Some time after this a timber-framed balcony was added to the north-east side at the rear. This was later walled in and converted to additional office space in the 1950s. The Maryborough Town Council looked after the bells but removed them in 1935 when the nearby Maryborough Town Hall gained its bells, though the lining, stair and some fittings remain inside the tower from its extension in 1879-80. The meeting room, current parcels room and cleaner's room retain some fittings and details left over from 1866. In the 1940s a divisional manager's office was added as part of a new wing at the rear. This was accompanied by a meeting room and recreation area replacing the original postmaster's and telegraph manager's quarters. In 1948 a new telephone exchange building was added to the site, during Frank Gibson Costello's term as Government Architect, and a three-truck garage was built. These additions appear to have supplanted the earlier outbuildings on the site, some of which had been built with Tiffin's original design. The ground floor verandah and first floor balconies were all removed at this time and replaced with cantilevered entrance awnings. These have themselves been taken away since then, so that by default the exterior is relatively close to its original form and its original intentions architecturally. A timber-framed mail room was added and several new doorways were opened up in 1956-7, and the mail room was extended in 1965. Concurrent with these works the internal spaces were upgraded with new timber and glass-panelled partitions, a refurbished public space and the floor and ceiling claddings were also substantially renewed. The original building was 2 storeys high with a 3-storey clock town. The clock tower extended to 5 storeys in 1879. The original fabric of the building includes: * Structural frame: Load-bearing solid brick on rendered plinth and footings, timber-framed floor and roof (1866-1885). Reinforced concrete slab to ground floor. * External walls: rendered and over-painted brick with cement rendered dressings and rusticated quoins to principal street elevations and clock tower with painted brick to rear elevations. * Internal walls: Generally hard plastered brickwork, later plasterboard partitioning. * Floor: Ground: reinforced concrete slab; first: timber framed and hardwood boarded. * Ceiling: Suspended grid-form acoustic tile, painted beaded timber boards, plasterboard and to firs floor, areas of non-original strapped plaster sheet. * Roof: Timber framed, hipped form recently re-clad with rust red 'colorbond'; ogee profile cast iron rainwater goods; rendered brick chimneys with moulded caps. Skillion-roofed rear first floor verandah roof finished with rust red \\"colorbond\\". * Other: timber-framed double-hung sash windows, \\"french doors\\", cast iron columns to ground floor public spaces. = Condition = Internally, wall, ceiling, floor and joinery fabric, including cast iron columns, original to the building and its subsequent nineteenth century stages of development remain throughout, albeit later modified, including the internal planning. Modifications include partitions and false ceilings. Alterations undertaken in 1906, 1925, 1950s and 1960s have impacted on the original albeit-evolved nineteenth century internal and external building components. Timber and brick surfaces throughout have also been overpainted.  Heritage listing  The significant components of Maryborough Post Office include the main postal complex of 1877-78 and clock tower, together with the weatherboard outbuilding to the rear. Maryborough Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The Maryborough Post Office, originally constructed in 1865-66 to the design of Colonial Architect, Charles Tiffin, and subsequently extended, is the oldest post office known to survive in Queensland, and is one of three remaining masonry post offices from the period between Queensland's separation from New South Wales in 1859 and the amalgamation of the post and telegraph departments in 1878. Its scale and imposing presence, including the prominent clock tower, is demonstrative of the growing regional importance of Maryborough in the nineteenth century. Its many additions and changes also reflect the need to physically update and adapt the building to Maryborough's prosperity and development. Criterion B: Rarity The Maryborough Post Office is the oldest post office known to survive in Queensland, and one of three remaining masonry post offices from the period between Queensland's separation from New South Wales in 1859 and the amalgamation of the post and telegraph departments in 1878. Criterion D: Characteristic values Maryborough Post Office is an example of: * a post office and quarters (first generation typology 1803-1869), with tower * a building in the Renaissance Revival / astylar Italianate style\\\\ * the work of the Colonial Architect's office under Charles Tiffin (1865-6); FDG Stanley (1875-9, tower extension); JJ Clark (1882-5); and Alfred Brady (1896-1906). The 1925 alterations may have been under JS Murdoch's Federal jurisdiction. Typologically, the original building comprised a post office and residence with tower, but relatively quickly accommodated the addition of a single faced clock in 1869 to the third level of the tower. Later nineteenth century works which impacted on the original form and planning include the enclosure of the loggias, a further storey added to the corner tower, a new wing constructed to house the expanding telephone exchange operation, a timber-framed balcony to the first floor level of the postmaster's quarters; and a variety of other internal and external alterations and additions in the twentieth century. These later works have impacted and diminished the typological attributes of the building Stylistically and architecturally, however, the building retains its Renaissance Revival and Italianate styling, as per Charles Tiffin's original design, including the symmetrical composition of a prominent corner clock tower flanked by arcaded loggias in antis between flanking pavilions and layered arched windows. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Maryborough Post Office is a key historic building within the centre of Maryborough, one of the most significant buildings in the town, and complemented by the Post Office Hotel opposite. Its Renaissance Revival and Italianate styling, including the symmetrical composition of a prominent corner clock tower flanked by arcaded loggias and pavilions; the rusticated banding, moulded cornices and architraves; and the pattern of fenestration and original timber window and door joinery, all contribute to the building's presence within the streetscape. Criterion G: Social value Maryborough Post Office has social significance as a much valued public heritage building in an important historic town, with a continuously operating history as a post office.

Named after the Portuguese playwright, Gil Vicente, (), the theatre opened in 1869. History Teatro Gil Vicente was inaugurated on August 15, 1869, with around 500 seats, consisting of 126 stall seats, 28 boxes and 200 seats in the gallery. The construction was carried out on the initiative of Manuel Rodrigues de Lima, a ship owner. It was built on the site of a small theatre that had been previously adapted from a warehouse. The work was supervised by Jos√© Vicente Costa. The scenery for the premiere was painted by two well-known scenographers, Achille Rambois and Giuseppe Cinatti. Although Cascais was just a fishing village in 1869, the decision of the Royal Family to spend part of the summer there from 1870 rapidly increased its importance and in its early years the theatre attracted many famous Portuguese actors. The theatre was often attended by King Lu√≠s I and other members of the Royal Family. Those who have performed at the theatre have included Hans M√ºnch, Sandor Vegh, and Karl Engel in addition to many of the most famous Portuguese artists of the period. In 1942 the theatre was purchased by the Associa√ß√£o Humanit√°ria dos Bombeiros Volunt√°rios de Cascais (Humanitarian Association of the Voluntary Firefighters of Cascais), which continues to run it as a theatre while also using it as the association‚Äôs headquarters.

Constructed in 1929, it was one of the four major air bases of the Republic of China Air Force in the 1930s. Laoyingfang was closed after 1949 and its site has been redeveloped for use by the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Jiangxi Normal University. History Laoyingfang Airport was opened in November 1929, the first airport in Nanchang, the capital of China's Jiangxi Province. It was very small at first, and was expanded a year later. During Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns against the Chinese Soviet Republic, the rebel communist base in southern Jiangxi, the airport was greatly expanded in 1933 and served as the base for more than 200 Kuomintang war planes. It became one of the four major air bases of the Republic of China Air Force, together with Hangzhou Jianqiao, Nanjing Dajiaochang, and Luoyang Beijiao. As Laoyingfang's proximity to the city centre impeded frequent military operations, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the construction of the even larger Sanjiadian Airport (later known as Qingyunpu Airport) in Qingyunpu, then in the far outskirts of Nanchang. The new air base was opened in the spring of 1935. In 1933, Chiang Kai-shek signed an agreement with Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini to establish a joint venture in China to manufacture airplanes. The company, called Sino-Italian National Aircraft Works (SINAW), was established in 1934 in Nanchang, with factories located at both Laoyingfang and Sanjiadian airports. It became the predecessor of Hongdu Aviation, one of China's major aircraft manufacturers. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, SINAW factories were severely damaged by Japanese aerial bombing. Nanchang was later occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army, which used Laoyingfang as an air base. It was likely from Laoyingfang that the Unit 731 launched germ warfare against the city of Changde in nearby Hunan province. In September 1945, after the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, China Airlines started to operate scheduled Shanghai‚ÄìFuzhou‚ÄìNanchang‚ÄìHankou flights from Laoyingfang Airport. It became a dedicated civil airport in May 1948. After the Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, Laoyingfang Airport fell into disuse and Xiangtang Airport was built as Nanchang's main airport for both military and civil flights. The site for Laoyingfang was redeveloped, part of which is occupied by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and its former runway is now a street on the campus of Jiangxi Normal University.

It was built from 1835 by Price Morris and family. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  Price Morris was a Welshman who was in 1812 transported to New South Wales with a life sentence at around age 29. Six years after his arrival, around 1818, he married Mary, who was born in the colony and was twenty years her husband's junior. Over the first ten years of marriage, Price and Mary had five children - Sarah (b. 1819), Elizabeth (b. 1821), Price, Jr. (b. 1824), William (b. 1826), and Mary (b. 1828). By 1828 Price senior had his ticket of leave and the family was living on 12 hectares (30 a) at Lower Portland on the Hawkesbury River, cultivating 10 hectares (25 a) and running half a dozen cattle. Shortly after the surveyor Felton Mathew compiled his map of all the occupied farms in the Macdonald Valley in 1833-4 (on which the Morrises do not feature), Price and Mary moved to St Albans, and on this land, just to the south of the swampy land in the middle of the rectangular block, they built the slab section of the present cottage. The cottage was deliberately on an elevated site to minimise the danger of flooding and overlooked their cultivation paddock. The exact date of building is not known, but it is likely to be between 1835 and 1837. Certainly the house was in existence by 1838 when what is claimed to have been the first Methodist service in the area was held in the cottage. Methodism was a strong bond between the Morrises and the Walker family who had moved from the Hawkesbury to the Macdonald around 1830 and established three generations of Methodist preachers. The Walters of the Industrious Settler, some of the Baileys, and the large Thompson fan-lily were also Methodists living nearby. This Methodist group was a counter-balance to the powerful Catholic influence of Sheehy and Watson, who gave land for the Catholic churches of St Joseph's and Our Lady of Loreto in 1839. Catholicism was also strong in the new township of St Albans. The survey in 1837 and gazettal in 1841 of a government township just across the Macdonald River from Price Morris's cottage confirmed the strategic nature of his purchase. In the 1830s there was a long-established cattle drovers' camp and a \\"bullock wharf\\" nearby on the river, at the head of navigation. The creation of the small grid pattern township of St Albans in the 1840s brought more population, much of it Catholic and Anglican, purchasing town allotments in 1842 and thereafter. The Anglican church was opened in 1843, in the township, the Settlers Arms in 1848. A Methodist church was finally built in 1853. By 1844 Price and Mary Morris had eleven children, establishing a network of interrelationships with other valley families, but both then returned to England and never returned to Australia. Price died in 1867 and Mary in 1888. Price, Jr. is presumably the Price Morris who was buried in St Albans cemetery in the year of his father's death, 1867. Margaret, one of the daughters-in-law of Price senior, was \\"Mag the Midwife\\" (b. 1839) whose business brought many visitors to the Morris cottage until her death in 1907. The third generation included William Price Morris (1874-1957), a grandson of Price and Mary; his memories of nineteenth- century St Albans were extensively used by Mrs Hutton Neve in her history of the valley. After William Price Morris died in 1957, the land remained in Morris hands but the original cottage was occupied by Beatrice Rose, a member of a very early Hawkesbury and Webbs Creek family. In Rose's time a fibro addition was made to the house, to serve as a dining-room, while she used both the huge indoor fireplace in winter and an outdoor fireplace in summer. Rose died in the 1970s and the cottage remained unoccupied. Linton Morris and his wife, the owners of portion 26, occupied a modern house on the north end of the land. After Mr Morris' death, his widow continued to own and occupy the land, assisted by her children. The property is now owned by her daughter, Mrs Joyce Stepto and her husband Doug.Jack 2000 The cottage has subsequently been restored and now operates as a bed and breakfast.  Description  Price Morris Cottage is a slab cottage with weatherboard extrusion on a levelled area supported by stone walling. There are five rooms with verandahs on three sides and a detached fibro-clad kitchen. The main house has one large external stone chimney which has structural defects. There is a surrounding farm complex of stables, dairy and milking bails, honey house, packing shed and privy. All roofs are corrugated iron over shingles. The main house is protected by a high wire fence for security.Jack 1999  Heritage listing  The wooden cottage is significant at the State level because it embodies to an unusual degree the features of pioneer settlement beyond the Hawkesbury River. The construction details of the house are significantly legible, showing expansion and adaptation as well as many original features. Its situation, on a levelled area on a hillside overlooking arable and grazing land beside the river, gives it high aesthetic qualities and is recognised by artists and travellers in the area. It is exceptional in having remained in ownership of the original family for over 160 years. Its importance to early Methodists in the lower Hawkesbury before a chapel was built is also significant Price Morris Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The cottage has high significance as the home of prominent Welsh Methodist settlers in the Lower Hawkesbury for several generations. It is the earliest intact slab complex in the valley and has particular significance as the earliest Methodist meeting place in the area. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Perched on a terrace set on the limit of cleared land on a well-treed hillside, with a stone wall retaining the levelled building site, overlooking the original cultivation and grazing paddocks, the cottage is exceptionally well sited and visible. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Price Morris Cottage has been variously: in the 1830s a centre for Methodist meetings; in the Victorian period a midwifes home; and in the twentieth century a well known scenic attraction for artists and photographers. In the area known as the home of a significant family for seven generations, the cottage has high social significance. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It has high significance for the details of vernacular building in various forms of wooden construction, detailing and wall coverings. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The uncompromised setting is now rare in the area; no comparable houses in the area has such undisturbed family ownership; it is uncommonly legible and well-preserved for a study of vernacular building; and it has retained unusual social significance over its entire history up to the present.

Family  Orithyia was the fifth daughter of King Erechtheus of Athens and his wife, Praxithea. Her brothers were Cecrops, Pandorus, and Metion, and her sisters were Protogeneia, Pandora, Procris, Creusa, and Chthonia.Bibliotheca 3.15.1.Suda s.v. Maidens, Virgins (Œ†Œ±œÅŒ∏Œ≠ŒΩŒøŒπ) Orithyia gave Boreas two daughters, Chione and Cleopatra (the wife of Phineus) and two sons, Calais and Zetes, both known as the Boreads. These sons grew wings like their father and joined the Argonauts in the quest for the golden fleece.Pindar. Pythian Odes, 4.8.  Legends  Boreas, the north wind, fell in love with Orithyia. At first he attempted to woo her, but after failing at that he decided to take her by force, as violence felt more natural to him.Ovid. Metamorphoses, VI.683. While she was playing by the Ilissos RiverBibliotheca, 3.15.2 she was carried off to Sarpedon‚Äôs Rock, near the Erginos River in Thrace. There she was wrapped in a cloud and raped.Apollonius of Rhodes. Argonautica, 1.212. Aeschylus wrote a satyr play about the abduction called Orithyia which has been lost. Plato writes somewhat mockingly that there may have been a rational explanation for her story. She may have been killed on the rocks of the river when a gust of northern wind came, and so she was said to have been 'taken by Boreas'. He also mentions in another account she was taken by Boreas not along the Ilissos, but from the Areopagus, a rock outcropping near the Acropolis where murderers were tried.Plato. Phaedrus, 229. However, many scholars regard this as a later gloss.See Fowler's translation of Phaedrus 229d. Plato also mentions that Orithyia was playing with a companion nymph Pharmacea.Phaedrus 229c. Because she was in Thrace with Boreas, she did not die when her sisters either committed suicide or were sacrificed so that Athens could win a war against Eleusis. Orithyia was later made into the goddess of cold mountain winds. It is said that prior to the destruction of a large number of barbarian ships due to weather during the Persian War, the Athenians offered sacrifices to Boreas and Oreithyia, praying for their assistance.Herodotus.

Amberdeep is one director-actor who is known for his attention to the details, but this film is clearly missing his signature touch.\\" Singh praised Gill‚Äôs performance most in the film, saying, \\"The most interesting character in Bhajjo Veero Ve is undoubtedly Gugu Gill. Gugu has a charisma and attitude, which the director has captured pretty well.\\" She also praised the performances of Nirmal Rishi, Hobby Dhaliwal, and Hardeep Gill.

It carries little elements which contains deep messages.\\" In last also praised the production work, said, \\"Technically movie is very strong and team has worked really hard on Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography, Graphics and Art Direction. The era of old times is depicted very beautifully in the movie. Concept of the movie is different and also presented in a good way.\\" Dixit Bhargav of Punjabi Mania gave 4 stars out of 5. Again the reviewer praised the screenplay and dialogues, consensus reads, \\"The screenplay of the movie is tightly written and gives clear impression of being derived from the Amberdeep Singh School of Writing. In which is the same case for dialogues, one wonders as to how he adds so much to fresh pieces each time round.\\" She praised the performances of Amberdeep and Simi Chahal described \\"impressive\\" also praised Gill, said, \\"It is worth mentioning that Guggu Gill steals the show in Bhajjo Veero Ve. The veteran is seen in a class of his own when it comes to acting in the movie.\\" Bhargav also praised the music of the film by Jatinder Shah, and songs \\"Car Reebna Wali\\" by Amrinder Gill and \\"Khyaal\\" by Gurshabad. Gurlove Singh of BookMyShow also praised the storyline and dialogues by Amberdeep, consensus reads, \\"The writer wastes no time and comes straight to the point by showcasing the plight of each unmarried brother. The dialogues, although in abundance about being bachelors, do not get monotonous and each instance brings a smile to your face.\\" Singh praised Gill's performance and described as \\"nostalgic\\" as it takes back to films in the 1980s. He also praised performances of Amberdeep, Chahal and Hardeep Gill. While also criticized the second half, said, \\"The second half is not at par with the first one. The story takes a backseat and the makers tend to push too many funny sequences into the second hour of the film.\\" In last added, \\"Bhajjo Veero Ve is entertaining and a well-made film. The funny dialogues between the brothers and the tussle between Amberdeep and Guggu Gill keep the viewers‚Äô interest alive throughout the film.

It was built in 1877. It is also known as Priory & Grounds. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Burwood= Parramatta Road was first created in 1791, a vital land (cf water) artery between Sydney Cove and Rose Hill's settlement and crops. Liverpool Road opened in 1814 as Governor Macquarie's Great South Road. Its winding route reflects pre-existing land grant boundaries. To Burwood's north over Parramatta was Longbottom Government Farm, staffed by convicts. This grew to over on heavily timbered flat, sloping to swamps on Hen and Chicken Bay. Commissioner Bigge recorded how valuable timber (ironbark) was cut and sawn on the spot, conveyed to Sydney in boats by the river. \\"Charcoal for the forges and foundries is likewise prepared here\\" he noted. Two grants were critical on Burwood's clay: Captain Thomas Rowley's Burwood Farm estate and William Faithful's grant to its south in Enfield covered most of modern Burwood. Rowley, adjutant of the NSW Corps, named it after the farm he'd lived on in Cornwall. 1799 and subsequent grants brought it to but he continued to live at Kingston Farm in Newtown until his death in 1806. He'd bought some of the first Spanish merinos brought from the Cape Colony in 1797, others being sold to Macarthur, Marsden & Cox. The southern boundary of his farm was approximately Woodside Avenue & Fitzroy Street. Under Rowley's will the estate passed to his three underage children executors Dr Harris & Major Johnstone were both involved in the 1808 Bligh rebellion and returned to England for the court martial. Governor Macquarie appointed Thomas Moore as guardian and executor. In 1812 he wrongfully auctioned the estate. It was bought by Sydney businessman Alexander Riley. He's believed to have built Burwood Villa in 1814 (perhaps on older (1797) foundations of Rowley's shepherd's cottage) and lived here until departing for England in 1817. In 1824 Joseph Lycett described the estate. had been cleared for pasture. Lycett in Views of Australia described \\"a garden of 4 acres in full cultivation, containing upwards of three hundred Trees, bearing the following choice fruits, viz. The Orange, Citron, Lemon, Pomegranate, Loquat, Guava, Peaches, Nectarines, Apricots, Apples, Pears, the Cherry, Plums, Figs, Chestnuts, Almonds, Medlars, Quinces; with abundance of Raspberries, Strawberries, and the finest Melons. &c;\\". Until the 1830s Burwood consisted of a few inns along the highways and 2 or 3 huge, undeveloped estates within the next 20 years these began to break up, attracting settlers and encouraging the growth of embryo villages at Burwood & Enfield. Riley died in 1833 and Rowley's children, now of age, started legal proceedings and regained possession of the 750 acre estate. It was divided between Thomas jnr., John, John Lucas* and Henry Biggs. Almost at once they subdivided into lots of for country homes and small farms. In 1834 Burwood estate was held by John Lucas, husband of Thomas's daughter Mary Rowley), who divided of his into small allotments for sale. Streets such as Webb, Lucas Road, Wentworth Road and Strathfield's The Boulevarde reflect the boundaries of these subdivisions/estates. To the south (including the land later the Appian Way) was William Faithful's grant of (1808) at \\"Liberty Plains\\". Faithful was a private in the NSW Corps: discharged in 1799 he became Captain Foveaux's farm manager, and this connection got him the grant. Apart from of Sarah Nelson's on Malvern Hill (Croydon), Faithful's Farm extended from Rowley's farm to Cooks River and west to Punchbowl Road. The government retained a right to build a road through it (doing so in 1815: Liverpool or the Great South Road), and to cut \\"such timber as may be deemed fit for naval purposes\\" - the area was thick with tall ironbark. Faithful exchanged it in 1815. Alexander Riley bought his north of the new road incorporating it into his Burwood estate. This was jointly owned by the Rowley family after 1833 and had no streets across it, only a few tracks. Despite opening up of the Rowley estate there was little settlement in Burwood between the two highways before 1860. Sydney Railway Company opened the first railway line to Parramatta in 1855. Burwood \\"station\\" (just west of Ashfield station, one of the first stations) was a wooden platform near a level crossing over the grassy track that was Neich's Lane* (later Burwood Road). This was beside \\"the newly laid out township of Cheltenham\\". Speedy transport meant subdivision and consolidation followed, filling out the area. Burwood's biggest growth spurt was between 1874 & 1900 (Burwood's population was, respectively: 1200-7400, an increase not matched since. *1835 maps show this as the only track between Parramatta / Liverpool Roads in Burwood. Between 1889 and 1918 Australia's population swelled from three to five million triggering an urgent need for housing. Suburban spread was greatly assisted by expansion of the public transport system of trams, ferries and trams, which formed a well-integrated pre-car transport system.Fraser, Hugh, in Heritage Council of NSW, 1981-4, amended and added to by Stuart Read, 17/5/2008 with excerpts from Eric Dunlop (1975). Burwood's first public school was . In 1843 land on Burwood Road was granted to the Anglican Church for a school. St. Mary's Catholic Church opened in 1846, a Presbyterian Church in 1857 and St. Paul's Anglican in 1871. Mansions of the 1870s+ such as The Priory were due to a firm belief in its health-giving climate, compared to the smog and crowding of the city suburbs. They were built as quasi-ancestral estates, perhaps in blissful ignorance of how quickly suburbs can evolve. Living was primitive: no street lighting (1883+), home lighting by candle or lamp (oil, kerosene after 1860), no gas (1882+), no piped water (1886+), home wells/tanks, few bathrooms, no indoor toilets, with pans (1880+) replacing outdoor cess pits. The 1880s+ was the era of the debates that led to Australia's fractious states combining into a single Federation, declared at Sydney's Centennial Park, in 1901. Skilled tradesmen and materials were plentiful and comparatively cheap, and combined with the improvement in building techniques associated with cavity walls, damp-courses and terracotta tiled rooves, provided the means for an era of intense building activity. Unlike the Victorian era's large commercial and Government building, the main thrust of the Federation era was constructing new suburbs around Sydney harbour with shops for the middle classes. Between 1889 and 1918 Australia's population swelled from 3 to 5 million triggering an urgent need for housing. Suburban spread was greatly assisted by expansion of the public transport system of trams, ferries and trams, which formed a well-integrated pre-car transport system. Rapid suburban growth brought increased interest in town planning and the British concept (Ebenezer Howard's 'Garden City') of the Garden Suburb, spurred on by the Federal Capital Competition of 1912. 1913's arrival from North America of winners, Walter Burley & Marion Mahony Griffin, saw formation of the Town Planning Association of NSW, with architect John Sulman as president. Founding members Sulman and J. P. Fitzgerald were among witnesses at the 1900 Royal Commission into the Improvement of the City of Sydney and suburbs. This made the first attempt at a comprehensive review of Sydney's problems, gathering many reform ideas. It recognised the relationship between planning and local government and advocated introduction of a town planning bill along the lines of John Burns' 1900 English Bill. Some recommendations, such as introducing building regulations for the whole metropolitan area \\"to prevent the straggling of suburbs and to ensure development along harmonious lines\\" went into 1919's Local Government Act. The \\"Garden Suburb\\" came to mean a suburb with special areas zoned for different uses, e.g.: residential and commercial; an absence of attached terraces with free-standing houses, wide tree-lined streets, \\"nature strips\\" on footpaths, parks reserves and gardens. Much-derided rear lanes and rights-of-way became redundant with sewerage and the provision of side access between houses. Verandas and bay windows were means of integrating house & garden. Tree-lined streets such as Burwood Road, The Appian Way or The Boulevard in Strathfield were in marked contrast to most development in Australian cities of the late 19th century. =The Priory= The Priory was built by grazier Mowbray Forrest, in 1877 on land purchased from C. H. Humphrey.

It was built from 1810 to 1820 by Thomas Rose. The property is owned by the Thomas and Jane Rose Family Society Inc. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous occupation= The lower Hawkesbury River was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups. The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport. =Early history of Wilberforce= Early European exploration of the Hawkesbury River began in 1789 with a series of expeditions initiated by Governor of New South Wales Arthur Phillip in his search for fertile land to serve the new colony's agricultural purposes. Although the Hawkesbury River valley was penetrated from Broken Bay to the site of present-day Windsor by 1790, evidence of very high floods observed by Phillip and other explorers prevented Governor Phillip from consenting to make land grants in the area. Despite Phillip's unwillingness to settle the Hawkesbury, Lieutenant-Governor Major Francis Grose proceeded in making 22 land grants in the district of Mulgrave Place in 1794, less than two years after Phillip departed the colony. Grose may have resorted to settling the Hawkesbury due to a lack of land available in the area between Sydney and Parramatta, after Grose had made numerous grants there to members of the New South Wales Corps. Grose reported in a dispatch in 1794, \\"I have settled on the banks of the Hawkesbury twenty-two settlers, who seem very much pleased with their farms. They describe the soil as particularly rich, and they inform me whatever they have planted has grown in the greatest luxuriance.\\" The first land grants consisted of 30 acres each, all with frontage to the river. Nineteen of the original 22 settlers were former convicts who had finished serving their sentences. Despite the challenges posed by inexperience, poor seed stock, and a lack of livestock to drive ploughs, it was reported that within the first 12 months, the average yield at the Hawkesbury settlement was 25 bushels per acre, double the yield elsewhere in the colony. Spurred on by the initial success, further grants of 25 to 30 acres were made to former convicts, with larger grants going to men from the New South Wales Corps. The European population of the Hawkesbury area increased to 546 inhabitants in the 1795 muster. Despite a rise in water recorded in 1795, which caused many early Hawkesbury settlers to leave the area, farming of the fertile floodplains by a new influx of settlers continued to increase. These early farmers concentrated their activities on the low lying land along the river, ignoring the ridgelines in favour of the more fertile land below. Floods recorded in 1799, 1800 and 1801 severely impacted the colony's economy, leading to vastly inflated prices for food and stores. However, the farming returns in 1802 were good enough for most farmers to pay off the debts incurred in the preceding three years. Soil erosion, caused by livestock, farming practices, and the recent flooding, began to be noted as a problem by 1803. In that year, Governor King introduced a measure to prevent erosion, prohibiting the removal of trees and shrubs within ten metres of the riverbanks. In 1804, King further established six commons for stock grazing, including Wilberforce Common. Despite these steps, the impact of the floods of 1806 and 1809 was immense. The river rose three times in 1806 and twice in 1809, causing damage to thousands of hectares of crops and losses amounting to tens of thousands of pounds. Again, food and grain prices became highly inflated, and government rations were reduced. Questions as to the feasibility of relying on the Hawkesbury as the main food source of the colony began to be posed by William Paterson, who was administering the colony in 1809. Governor Macquarie arrived in the colony in the wake of the 1809 flood disaster, and within 12 months of his arrival, had established the five 'Macquarie Towns': Windsor, Richmond, Wilberforce, Pitt Town and Castlereagh. He sited the towns on higher ground and induced the settlers to relocate their dwellings to higher land in order to minimise the threat of damage from flooding. The towns were laid out on a rectangular grid plan, with a major public square in a central position. Each town was to have a combined school house/church building, with separate land grants set aside for the school master and clergyman. Under the leadership of Macquarie, the Hawkesbury settlers experienced a heretofore unknown level of stability. Commissioner of Inquiry John Thomas Bigge arrived from England in 1820 in order to investigate the state of the colony on behalf of the Crown. Bigge's comments on the farming industry in the Hawkesbury River region reflect both the challenges faced by the settlers and the incomparable fertility of the soil. In his 1823 Report, Bigge referred to the flood plain soil as \\"distinguished by its depth and inexhaustible fertility. It lies on both sides of the rivers Nepean and Hawkesbury, and the largest tract is that which is formed by a bend of the latter river between the town of Windsor and the township of Wilberforce.\\" Bigge reported that in 1820, the towns of Windsor, Wilberforce and Richmond had 10,000 acres of wheat or maize sown in a total 16,856 acres of cleared land, the most in the colony. In contrast to the fertility of the soil, Bigge commented on the poor state of the farms in the region, stating that \\"the farms, or rather allotments, in these districts [of the Hawkesbury] are small; the houses generally ill-built and exhibiting traces of former inundations...[the] more opulent settlers have begun to fence their estates with strong railing made of stringy and iron bark trees.\\" He attributed the poor state of farm buildings in the colony to the cost and lack of \\"mechanical labour,\\" as well as the carelessness of many of the settlers. Wilberforce tended to have a higher proportion of free settlers to former convicts than the other Macquarie towns. The Reverend Cartwright reported in 1819 to the Bigge Commission that church attendance was good at Wilberforce, and the congregation was composed mainly of the \\"regular families.\\" The combined school house/church was constructed in 1819 and is now the last building of the original school house. A steam mill was established by Buttsworth in 1835 near the river facing Buttsworth Lane. From the end of Buttsworth Lane, a punt crossed the Hawkesbury to Pitt Town Bottoms from as early as 1812. =Land grants= Upon Thomas Rose's arrival in NSW in 1793, he and the other settlers from the ship Bellona were given land grants in an area near present day Strathfield, which they named \\"Liberty Plains\\" after the fact that they were all free settlers. Thomas Rose selected 120 acres on the right bank of Powell's Creek. Despite being an experienced farmer, Rose struggled with the poor soil at Liberty Plains, and by 1802 purchased 15 acres of land known as Laurel Farm on the banks of the Hawkesbury River near Wilberforce, approximately one mile from the site of Rose Cottage. Thomas Rose lost everything in the floods of 1806 and 1809. The land on which Rose Cottage is now situated is part of a 30 acre grant to William Mackay made by Governor Hunter in 1797. In January 1806 Mackay transferred the north-eastern half of his grant, described as \\"that part to Howarth's Farm\\" to James Roberts. Two months later, Roberts sold this land to W. M. Nowland, a blacksmith, who then sold the land to Joshua Rose in 1809. Thomas Rose and his wife had been accompanied on their voyage from England on the Bellona by their four children, Thomas (to avoid confusion, herein referred to as Thomas II), Mary, Joshua and Richard, aged 13, 11, 9 and 3 respectively. After arriving in the colony, Thomas Rose had three more children. Most of Thomas and Jane's children remained in Australia, many establishing farms of their own along the Hawkesbury River. The family appears to have retained a patriotism for England, as Thomas II and Joshua returned to England -1806, and father and sons contributed subscriptions to the Waterloo fund in 1816. =Construction of Rose Cottage= Despite widespread secondary sources indicating that it was Thomas Rose who acquired the subject land, there is no primary documentary evidence to support this. It was certainly his son Joshua Rose who was the first Rose family owner of the land. There is no firm documentary evidence relating to the construction of Rose Cottage; our dating is based on the physical evidence remaining at the cottage. The vertical timber slab construction technique and the pre-1820 gudgeon hinges used in Doors 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 provide a strong indication that the main part of the cottage (Spaces 1, 2, 5, 6, and the verandah) was built in the period 1809-1820. The original plan form of the cottage was much the same as it is today; however the rear skillion may have been added at another time in the early 19th century. The physical evidence for this later addition includes the use of weather boards inside the skillion, and the use of bush poles for refters, whereas the rafters of the main swing are split. Previous attempts to date the cottage through documentary sources have generally relied on two historical events: Governor Macquarie's General Offer stating requirements for the size and materials of new dwellings in the five Macquarie towns made 15 December 1810, and the reputed visit of Reverend Samuel Leigh to 'old Tom Rose's home' in 1817. In his report on Rose Cottage in 1982, Alan Roberts, Field and Research Officer for the Royal Australian Historical Society, concluded that this evidence for the date of the cottage is questionable, neither proving nor disproving the claim that Rose Cottage was built in the period 1811-1817. Roberts points out that Rose Cottage is not in full compliance with Macquarie's promulgation of 1810, and no source for Rev. Leigh's reference to 'old Tom Rose's home' was found. Additionally, this reference does not necessarily indicate Rose Cottage, merely whichever house Thomas Rose Senior was occupying at the time. The question of which members of the family occupied Rose Cottage is also open to speculation. Thomas Rose's land at Laurel Farm was rented to one J. Armstrong in the 1821 Return of Land in Wilberforce. Although he owned the farm at Rose Cottage between 1809 and 1850, Joshua Rose was listed in the 1828 Census as a resident of Lower Portland head. An 1818 surveyor's field book makes reference to 'Rose's hut' at that location, which indicates that Joshua had built a dwelling on his Portland head holding by this time. The muster records of 1818, 1819, 1821 and 1822 do not provide conclusive evidence as to which member of the family was farming the land. The 1841 census records both Joshua and Thomas II as residents of Wilberforce. In 1850, Joshua transferred the subject land to his brother, Thomas II, in an unregistered dealing recited in a 1913 conveyance. Joshua retained a small strip of land bordering the subject land to the southwest, which remained in the Rose family until 1955. In 1854, Thomas II composed his will, leaving Rose Cottage as ell as Laurel Farm to his son Charles: > I devised All that parcel of land containing 14 acres more or less part of > Mackay's Grant situate at Wilberforce aforesaid with the buildings thereon > now in my own occupation. Also all that parcel of land containing 15 acres > more or less part of Laurell's [sic] Grant situate at Wilberforce aforesaid > now in my own occupation unto and to the use of the said Charles Rose his > heirs and assigns forever But subject to and charged (with the personal > estate herein before bequeathed to him) with the payment of the following > legacies namely To each of them the said Mary Ann Graham - Thomas Rose - > Richard Coley - Alexander Milson - Maria Stewart and Charlotte Flannery the > sum of twenty five pounds and I direct the legacies hereinbefore bequeathed > to be paid at the end of one year from my decease..... Of the four farms mentioned in Thomas II's will, totalling 89 acres, the only reference to a building is that made above, on the land where Rose Cottage is presently located. This is the earliest documentary evidence (1854) positively identifying the existence of structures on the subject land. Thomas II and his de facto spouse Ann were reported to be safe in the attic during the devastation 1867 flood of the Hawkesbury, while the flood waters reached a height of one metre on the ground floor of the cottage. Possibly due to the damage caused by this flood or upon Thomas II's death in 1869 when his son Charles inherited the cottage, several repairs to the cottage were carried out in the lat 19th century. Hardwood weatherboards were fixed over the vertical slabs to the east of the rear door (south elevation) and the eastern gable. Beaded lining boards were added to the south and east with a Victorian moulded-top skirting board along the east wall. At some time in the 19th century, corrugated galvanised steel sheeting was fixed over the roof and original shingles, and guttering was probably first installed. =Farm subdivision= Charles Rose, Thomas II's son, was the proprietor of the place from 1869 until his death in May 1911. However, it is unknown whether Charles resided there. His occupation was as a carrier. He married Marry Ann Green in 1859 at his uncle Henry's station at Warialda, NSW, and at least his first 6 children were born there (between 1860 and 1874). In his will dated 20 May 1911, Charles Rose devised: > All those my thirteen and three quarter acres of land more or less at > Wilberforce whereon I now reside Unto and to the use of my two sons John > Henry Rose and Richard Alfred Harold Rose in equal shares their respective > heirs and assigns for ever to be divided by a line from the road to the > river Hawkesbury so that my son John Henry Rose shall take as his half the > portion on which is the Homestead and the other buildings and being the part > adjoining the property of Edward Thomas Bowd and so that my son Richard > Alfred Harold Rose shall take as his half the other portion on which is the > house erected by him. Charles Rose died 28 May 1911 and his wife Mary Ann died in 1912. In December 1913, John and Richard registered an indenture describing the two equal parcels of land, each measuring 6.3.12 1/2 acres. Fenced boundary lines are noted in the indenture between John's parcel and Bowd's farm (on Howith's grant) and between Richard's parcel and the small strip of land formerly owned by Joshua Rose. In the indenture, John is listed as a farmer, and Richard as a dairyman. Physical changes made to the cottage in the early 20th century may have been made by John Rose after receiving the cottage upon the death of his parents. (The repairs could also have been made to make the cottage more comfortable for Charles and Mary Ann Rose in the later years of their lives.) Pine weatherboards were fixed over the slabs on the west side of the rear door (south elevation), over the fixed internally to all walls in the front room, as well as the west and south walls in the front bedroom, and on the north wall in the kitchen. Additionally, the stepladder to the attic was rebuilt and lined with similar boards to the walls. =Australiana Pioneer Village= After John Henry Rose's death in 1961, Rose Cottage, including the other half of the land devised to Richard in Charles' 1911 will, was purchased by Dugald McLachlan. McLachlan was the proprietor of the Tropicana Hotel, next door to Rose Cottage, and envisioned making Rose Cottage the centrepiece of a theme park called the Australiana Pioneer Village. McLachlan went on to acquire almost all of Mackay's original 30-acre grant, and set about moving other old buildings from their original locations to the site. The Australiana Pioneer Village was opened to a tourist attraction in 1970, featuring Rose Cottage, as well the Kurrajong railway station and the 1850s police station from Riverstone. Repairs to the cottage carried out by Bill McLachlan in establishing the Pioneer Village included bagging over and cementing walls in the two bedrooms, replacing rotted bases to verandah posts, laying a concrete floor to the verandah, installing metal flashing above the wall plate, and adding new guttering. The earliest photographs recording the state of the cottage prior to this repairs are part of a Richmond High School report made in 1965. These photographs show a grapevine trellage and agave to the south of the cottage, as well as the branches of a large peppercorn tree to the west of the cottage. The 1961 gutters are also visible. The Pioneer Village changed hands several times in the ensuing years, with Mawsons Hotel Pty Ltd the dominant controlling interest between 1969 and 1983. When Mawsons began seeking interested buyers for the Village, the future of Rose Cottage became an increasingly pressing concern. Following Alan Roberts' report on behalf of the Royal Australian Historical Society in 1982, Gordon Fuller & Associates, architect, wrote to the National Trust of Australia (NSW) urging the body to classify Rose Cottage as a matter of urgency, and to make representations to the Heritage Council of NSW for the making of a Permanent Conservation Order under the NSW Heritage Act, \\"excising the building and site from the remainder of the Pioneer Village property\\". Fuller's report followed an inspection of the site and made recommendations of the works which would be necessary to preserve the building. In August 1985, Permanent Conservation Order No. 358 was placed on Rose Cottage by the Heritage Council of NSW. The Order applied to the current title boundary of Rose Cottage. The following month, Hawkesbury City Council acquired the entire Australiana Pioneer Village, including Rose Cottage. In 1988, the Council debated donating ownership of Rose Cottage to the Thomas and Jane Rose Family Society, Inc. (established in 1975), with some councillors opposed to the donation saying that it was the most important building in the Pioneer Village, and therefore worth keeping. Another councillor expressed that \\"It's not the sort of heritage that we like to live up to.\\" In 1988 Clive Lucas, Stapleton and Partner wrote a Conservation Analysis and Draft Policy for Treatment of Fabric for the Heritage Council of NSW on Rose Cottage. In 1993, Hawkesbury City Council leased Rose Cottage to the Thomas and Jane Rose Family Society, and in 1995 transferred the title. Substantial stabilisation works were carried out under the NSW Heritage Assistance Program in 1994, with repairs made to the roof, foundations, flooring, cladding, windows, chimneys and fireplaces, directed by Otto Cserhalmi & Associates, architects.Clive Lucas, Stapleton and Partners Pty Ltd, 2004, 38-45  Description  =Cottage= The cottage is located to the southwest of the lot, near to the boundary with the Heritage Hotel-Motel. The cottage is an early 19th century colonial vernacular structure. Single storey with attic containing four rooms, verandah to the north side. Constructed with a mixture of vertical slab, timber frame, split lath, mud infill, and weatherboard. The main roof is framed in split rafters for shingle roofing; a skillion roof to the south is framed in bush poles. Hipped roof at west; gabled at east. Two brick chimneys on west elevation. =Grounds and garden= The 2282 meter square property, herein called the garden, is located on a wide flat ridge above the Hawkesbury River flood plain which lies to the east. The property is bounded by Rose Street to the northeast, the Australiana Pioneer Village to the south and southeast, private property with a dwelling to the east, and the Heritage Hotel-Motel to the west. The property is enclosed by fencelines on all sides, some possibly reconstructed as part of the Australiana Pioneer Village. The entrance to the property is via a pedestrian gate at the northwest; pedestrian and vehicular gates on the southwest provide access to a track in the Australiana Pioneer Village. The cottage is surrounded on all sides by grassed areas with patches of rose bush cultivation and several trees, including white cedar (Melia azedarach var.australasica), false acacia/black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), Citrus sp., a bed of roses to the cottage's west. A significant pepper(corn) tree (Schinus molle) is in the southern boundary. A significant rose shrub (Rosa cv.) is at the south- east corner of the cottage and a wattle (Acacia sp.) to the east of the cottage. Other plantings of moderate significance are a gum tree (Eucalyptus sp.) is to the cottage's south west, a grove of eucalypts to the cottage's south, a willow (Salix sp.) to its southeast, a quince (Cydonia oblonga cv.) to its south-west and the remains of former fence corner posts to the cottage's north east. Landscape items of some significance include: a former boundary line indicated by eucalypts and pine trees (Pinus sp.), fencing at the southern end of the spray area, parallel to the river, a fenced boundary line to the cottage's east extending to the river, riverside vegetation, the remainder of the associated land and shed 1.CLSP, 2004, 57-8 With a few exceptions the plantings appear to be post 1961. Rose Cottage exhibits a sense of containment due to its elevated position. Related landscape features are a \\"forecourt\\" area and an area at the back of the cottage and outbuildings. =Other Site Features= A water cistern is located at the Rose Street frontage of the Heritage Hotel-Motel, reportedly constructed by the Rose family. Victorian brick dome construction with concrete capping, late 19th century, but possibly over an earlier structure. =Outbuildings= Two sheds are located along the boundaries, to the south and west; and an outbuilding is located close to the south elevation of the cottage. Rose Cottage's outbuildings consist of two distinct construction phases. * Outbuilding - west: single-storey, slab walls with bush pole framed sloping roof sheeted in old corrugated galvanised iron, concrete floor, c.1880. * Outbuilding - east: single-storey, sloping roof sheeted in corrugated galvanised iron, slab walls and sawn and chamfered hardwood rafters, earth floor, early 20th century. * Shed 1: single-storey, pitched roof bush pole, timber slab and corrugated galvanised iron, steel mesh, and pipe construction with granolithic paving and display area for birds, mid to late 20th century. * Shed 2: Sawn hardwood and corrugated galvanised iron constructed for display of animals, late 20th century.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Rose Cottage is an outstanding example of early 19th century timber slab / lath and plaster construction, most probably dating to the 1810s or 1820s, and inhabited by the Rose family, among the first free settlers to come to Australia, from its construction until 1961. The cottage has retained a visual relationship with the associated land, and provides an indication and is evocative of the nature of early farming settlements along the Hawkesbury River. The cottage is valued by the community as the oldest extant timber slab dwelling in Australia. Rose Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Previous historical reports, heritage assessments, and media sources have reported that Rose Cottage is the oldest timber slab dwelling extant in its original location in Australia. The documentary evidence for the date of construction of Rose Cottage relies on two sources: as the cottage at least partly complies with Macquarie's 1810 promulgation on the dimensions of dwellings in the five Macquarie Towns, it is assumed that construction took place after 1810; and it is reported by Hawkesbury historian D. G. Bowd that the Wesleyan Methodist minister Samuel Leigh visited Rose Cottage in 1817. However, despite later research to confirm the citation of Samuel Leigh's visit to the cottage, no reference has been located. Additional research undertaken for this report also failed to locate positive documentary evidence of the existence of Rose Cottage any earlier than 1854 when Thomas II Rose made a devise in his will for his farm on Mackay's grant and the buildings thereon. From the physical evidence it can be reasonably determined that the main part of the cottage (Spaces 1, 2, 5, 6, and the verandah) was constructed prior to 1820, indicated by the use of gudgeon hinges, the vertical timber slab construction technique, and the window sashes used in the front/north facade of the cottage. The skillion-roofed section containing the kitchen and a rear bedroom appears to be an early addition possibly dating to the 1830s. While previous historical assessments may be inaccurate and much about the history of the place is still unknown, Rose Cottage, together with the associated land, is demonstrative of the form of rural development from the earliest period of settlement on the Hawkesbury River. No other similar examples of this age and retaining a relationship with the former farm lands are known from the Wilberforce area. The associated land, comprising approximately 15 acres of William Mackay's 30 acre grant of 1794, was farmed by the Rose family from 1809, when Joshua Rose acquired the property, to 1961, when John Henry Rose died and the cottage and land were acquired by Bill McLachlan, founder of the Australiana Pioneer Village. Some aspects of the long-term land use of the place are still evident on the grounds of the Pioneer Village, including some mid-twentieth century fencing, the grove of eucalypts to the south of the cottage, and a line of trees marking the western boundary line of the farm. Many settlers who received land grants in the initial settlement of the Hawkesbury vacated the land after the damaging floods of 1802 and 1806. In the case of the grant containing Rose Cottage, the land was subdivided in half in January 1806, creating two 15 acres farms. Later subdivisions within the Rose family were made through wills. In each subdivision, the new lots maintained direct access to the Hawkesbury River, creating long, narrow parcels. Mackay's grant is among the first series of farm allotments made on the outskirts of Sydney. The subsequent subdivision of the grant took place very early in history of the site. While suburban subdivisions were made in the surrounding area during the later 20th century, the land at Rose Cottage remained relatively intact to its 1806 configuration, due to the long occupation of the Rose family and the formation of the Australiana Pioneer Village. This configuration is still evident in the cadastral layout of Rose Cottage and the associated land today, and is representative of the land subdivision patterns of the early 19th century as it took place in the area of Wilberforce. After Bill McLachlan acquired Rose Cottage and the associated land in 1961, he set about obtaining much of the land contained in Mackay's 30 acre grant to establish the Australiana Pioneer Village. McLachlan transported other old buildings of many types to the site to create a heritage theme park, which opened in 1970. The collection of heritage buildings, machinery, and other artefacts together into an open-air village-themed park was a trend of the 1970s and 1980s. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Rose Cottage is associated with the Rose family, who were among the first fifteen free settlers to arrive in Australia on the Bellona in 1793. Thomas Rose was an experienced farmer from Dorset, England who responded to the Government's incentive to attract settlers of a land grant, tools, provisions, and the service of convicts free of charge for two years. David Collins, in his assessment of the first group of free settlers said Thomas Rose was \\"the most respectable of these people, and apparently the best calculated for a bona- fide settler.\\" No other structures built by the first and second generations of the Rose family are known to survive; however, there is photographic evidence for the third generation Rose family cottage at Freemans Reach on the Hawkesbury. Thomas' wife, Jane Rose, gave birth to a son six months after their arrival in the colony, the first free child born to free settlers in the colony. In the Sydney Gazette obituary for Jane Rose in 1828, it was noted that she was the first woman to attain the status of great-grandmother in the colony. The Rose family continuously occupied Rose Cottage and farmed the associated land from 1809 until 1961. The associated of the family with the place is made more distinct by the survival of the dwelling, resulting in a significance that is rare state-wide. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Apart from the lack of documentary evidence confirming the date of construction of Rose Cottage, the physical evidence suggests an early construction for the cottage, possibly in the 1810s or 1820s. There are numerous other timber slab structures in the Upper Hawkesbury district. Examples located near Rose Cottage include: * 127 King Road, Wilberforce * 87 King Road, Wilberforce None of the extant timber slab dwellings have been assessed to be as old as Rose Cottage. However, the timber slab stables at the Macquarie Arms Inn, Windsor, are reputed to date to 1811-16. In view of this, Alan Roberts qualified in his 1982 report on Rose Cottage that is may be the oldest timber house (rather than building) surviving in Australia. Other extant vernacular farm cottages from the early settlement of Australia's mainland include Cos's Cottage, Mulgoa (1811-16); Mountain View, Richmond (1812); Agnes Banks, near Richmond (c.1820); Bowman Cottage, Richmond (1819); Denbigh, Narellan (1817); Moxey's Farm, Richmond ( 1820); and Cad-Die, Clarence Reach ( 1820). However, none of these buildings consists of a timber slab structure, leaving Rose Cottage to be the only building of this type dating to the period of early settlement. Rose Cottage is an outstanding, intact example of vernacular building technique of the early 19th century. Due to the continuing semi-rural character of the surrounding area, the setting of Rose cottage remains evocative of the history of farming represented by the presence of the cottage. The nature of the relationship of the cottage with the associated land has been preserved due to the later sympathetic use of the land as the Australiana Pioneer Village. Some remnant features of the associated land probably date to the 20th century Rose family occupation of Rose Cottage, including fence lines and fences, a boundary line marked by trees, and the grove of eucalypts to the south of the cottage. The riverside vegetation, although none of it appears to be very old, reflects the 1803 promulgation by Governor King prohibiting the clearing of growth within ten metres of the river bank in order to curtail erosion. The placehas strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. In 1975 two descendants of Thomas and Jane Rose, having researched much of the family's history and genealogy, established the Thomas and Jane Rose Family Society. The primary aims of the society were twofold: first, the conservation of Rose Cottage; second, publication of a published Rose family history and genealogy. The first Rose family reunion was held in 1982 and since then has been held triennially. The Society now numbers over 300 members and estimates that there are over 20,000 descendants of Thomas and Jane Rose identified through its genealogical research. The descendants of Captain William Cox have a similar family society and Cox's Cottage is extant in the Mulgoa Valley; however, this family is more focused in the region of Mudgee. Therefore, the association of the Thomas & Jane Rose Family Society with Rose Cottage is considered to be of locally rare significance. General community regard for Rose Cottage is also demonstrated by the number of heritage listings for it: Hawkesbury Local Environmental Plan, National Trust of Australia (NSW), NSW State Heritage Register and the Register of the National Estate. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The long span of occupation of Rose Cottage will have resulted in remnants of information now accessible through the archaeological record. The archaeology of the associated land and garden would primarily constitute an analysis of previous structures at the site, such as the outbuilding visible in the aerial photography to the southeast of the garden area and may also help to establish the nature of plantings and land use across the site. There is potential to yield more information about the history and use of s farm properties in Australia in the early 19th century through archaeological investigation of crops, paddock boundaries, and drainage/irrigation systems. There is also potential for occupational remains to be revealed in and around the cottage and outbuilding, as well as at the cistern located adjacent to the Heritage Hotel-Motel. The information would potentially be of particular interest because of the long occupation of the house by members of the one family. As an intact, early example of a slab-built cottage, further investigation of the structure of Rose Cottage has the potential to reveal more information about timber construction methods of the period.

It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon and George Oakeshott (assistant draughtsman) and built by New South Wales Works Branch. It is also known as Burwood Post Office (former). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 May 2001.  History  =Burwood= Burwood derived its name from a grant of 250 acres made by Governor Hunter on 3 August 1799 to Captain Thomas Rowley of the NSW Corps, who named the land Burwood Farm, after the land on which he had lived in his native Cornwall, England. Along with John Macarthur and Rev. Samuel Marsden, Rowley was one of the men who purchased merino sheep from the original flock brought to Australia by Captain Waterhouse in 1797. Although Rowley had another farm at Newtown where he lived, he would have pastured some of his sheep at Burwood. His name is remembered in Rowley Street. His tomb was originally laid at Kingston Farm, but has since been re-erected in Waverley Cemetery.Burwood City Council website, history. In 1812 the land was bought by well-known Sydney businessman (and farmer), Alexander Riley, who built the district's first house, \\"Burwood Villa\\" in 1814. This stood on a site c. 400 m west of the Coronation Club and a small granite obelisk was erected on the western side of Burwood Park to mark the position of the villa, when it was demolished in 1937. RIley cleared and cultivated of this land and successfully introduced into the colony the orange, lemon, pomegranate, loquat, grape, peach, nectarine, apricot, apple, pear, cherry, plum, fig, chestnut, almond, medlar, quince, raspberry, strawberry and melon. A stagecoach began running to Parramatta in 1814 and in the 1820s inns were built at staging posts where coaches changed horses at intervals along Parramatta Road. This was the era when bushrangers were a scourge of Parramatta and Liverpool Roads, hiding out in undeveloped lands and making roads unsafe. In about 1833 the owners of a number of grants commenced to subdivide and sell their lands and thus started the growth of the suburb of Burwood. The Municipality of Burwood was incorporated in 1874. The suburb at the time was a quiet little village with a mere 1200 people and only about 300 buildings. Its southern boundary was Liverpool Road, beyond which lay the even more sparsely settled village of Enfield. The railway from Sydney to Parramatta opened in 1855. There were four stations ‚Äì Newtown, Ashfield, Burwood and Homebush. In 1874 Five Dock station opened and in 1876 changed its name to Croydon. That same year Concord station opened, renamed Redmyre in 1877 and again renamed to Strathfield railway station in 1885. In 1860 the number of daily trains to and from Sydney was six each way. Two level crossings at Burwood Road were replaced by overhead bridges in 1892. The third bridge and set of railway lines were built in 1926. Opening the railway was a momentous event for Burwood as it made the suburb easily accessible to the city and brought a number of wealthy merchants and industrialists who built spacious country houses. The population rose from 7400 in 1900 to over 20000 by 1930. In 1912 steam trams were replaced by electric trams. The tram from Ashfield to Enfield was extended to Burwood and Mortlake in 1899 and Cabarita in 1907. =Burwood Post Office= In 1869 a post office was situated at the railway station. Postal services were previously conducted through general stores. In 1886, a new building was erected at the railway station and in 1892, the present day post office, designed by W. L. Vernon, was opened. The construction of new post offices continued throughout the Depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon who retained office from 1890 to 1911. Although a total of twenty-seven offices were erected between 1892 and 1895, funds available to the new Government Architect's Branch were cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone many important projects. George Oakeshott was the assistant draughtsman in Vernon's Office and had responsibility for post office designs. He had arrived in NSW from England in 1891 when he joined the Colonial Architect's Branch and was promoted to chief draughtsman in 1897, a position he held until his resignation in 1900. Reynolds (author) notes that he became the first director of the NSW Works Branch of the Department of Home Affairs, later transferring to the Commonwealth. He attributes the stylistic changes in the design of post offices under Vernon in large part to Oakeshott. This assertion is reinforced by the fact that the most distinguished English Domestic Revival post offices were erected in the Sydney metropolitan area at locations including Newtown (1893), Enmore (1895), Annandale (1895‚Äì96), Arncliffe (1897‚Äì98) and Summer Hill (1900). They include details and materials common to the Queen Anne style, attributed especially to Norman Shaw who had been practising successfully in England in this style for some decades. The incorporation of Dutch Renaissance motifs, notably gables with strapwork and volutes is also characteristic. This group of post offices reflects the architectural trends of its day, being in the vanguard of the movement away from neo-Classicism in 1893 and in the mainstream during the late 1890s. The use of the prominent semi-circular arch or window opening also gained acceptance, during the first decade of Vemon's office. The earliest application no longer remaining in AP (Australia Post) ownership is at Burwood (1892‚Äì93), which has both American and English precedent but is most accurately described as being in the American Romanesque style. Following its introductory phase during the early 1890s, the round arch motif remained popular throughout the decades and was continued in use as late as 1910 at Lithgow. It was during the early 1890s that prominent clock towers were last used, its demise no doubt arising directly from the economic malaise of the period. As a device for corner enrichment, however, a number of substitutes were developed under Vernon. At Glen Innes the corner porch is surmounted by a balcony with low pitched roof in the Arts and Crafts manner. A porch with balcony is a prominent corner element at Narrandera, whilst at Summer Hill a faceted projecting porch and surmounting balcony and roof substitute for one of Barnet's towers. Even at Newcastle (1902‚Äì03), conceived somewhat belatedly in the full-blown, Italianate style, there is no tower, but rather domed corner pavilions. The clock was added to the tower in 1901. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs. J. F. Hennessy, Mayoress in 1892.  Description  A two-storey polychrome brick building with four storey campanile in Italian Romanesque Revival style built in 1892 and designed by W. L. Vemon. The facade is of asymmetrical design dominated by the tower. A massive arched opening leads to the posting boxes. Beautifully detailed brickwork and facade is embellished with sandstone royal insignia, various arched openings, string courses and a sandstone plinth, sixteen pane windows and a terracotta tiled roof. To sum up some of the characteristics of Vernon's style, emphasis must be placed on the use of brick and stone dressing as building media, gables rather than parapets, irregular massing of volumetric shapes, restricted use of ornamentation in most buildings after the turn of the century, frequent use of the plain rounded arch and semicircular windows: all of these allied to a generally picturesque modest domestic air. Look at almost any of the Vernon suburban or New South Wales country post offices, police stations, court houses and (after 1904) schools, and some or all of these characteristics will be present. = Condition = As at 7 February 2001, the front facade is in good condition and intact except for the 1930 modification turning the large round headed ground-floor window into an archway over terrazzo steps. The tower and the front main roof are intact. The roofs may need maintenance. , the 1892 opening memorial plaque from outside the entry lobby was removed or stolen. Apart from changing the front ground floor window to an archway the front elevation, tower and main roof remain intact and a good example of Vernon's work. = Modifications and dates = The main round headed window at the front was changed to an archway when terrazzo steps were added to provide a more direct access from the street. Other internal alterations were probably carried out at that time and later post boxes were added. Two storey additions were added at the rear including a concrete staircase in 1958. The typical internal counter details were removed possibly in the 1970s and recently the interiors have been cleared of all fittings.  Heritage listing  As at 8 March 2006, an excellent example of a suburban post office designed by the government architect W. L. Vernon in the Federation Anglo Dutch Revival style. The asymmetrical facade of well detailed brickwork has a massive arch at ground level and other openings with semi-circular arches, all characteristic of the style. The square campanile is a more Italianate element, which enables the post office to be a focus of the townscape.RNE Burwood Post Office is a landmark building and is clearly visible from many parts of the Municipality that has become an icon for the community, which uses it as a logo on many documents and other places both now and in the past. It is arguably the most well known building in Burwood. It is part of a significant and architecturally outstanding group of public buildings, particularly Post Offices, designed by the government architect of the day Walter Liberty Vernon and is a rare example of a secular building with a corner tower. Burwood Post Office has always been close to and associated with Burwood Station, which is identified in the State Heritage Inventory. For many years it was located in part of the station buildings and there still remains the last building used as a post office on the south side of the tracks to the west of Burwood Road. It should also be considered as part of a group associated with communications including the Station and the structure earlier used as a post office. It is considered to be of Regional and State significance because of its long association with the area, its association with an outstanding group of buildings by the Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon, particularly his Post Offices, the quality of its design and construction including its rare tower element, which is a landmark in the region. This statement applies to that part of the building designed by W. L. Vernon. Later additions to the building are of lesser or no significance. Burwood Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 May 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. In 1892, the present day Post Office, designed by W. L. Vernon, was opened.

The use of the prominent semi-circular arch or window opening also gained acceptance, during the first decade of Vemon'.s office. The earliest application no longer remaining in AP (Australia Post) ownership is at Burwood (1892‚Äì93), which has both American and English precedent but is most accurately described as being in the American Romanesque style. Following its introductory phase during the early 1890s, the round arch motif remained popular throughout the decades and was continued in use as late as 1910 at Lithgow. It was during the early 1890s that prominent clock towers were last used, its demise no doubt arising directly from the economic malaise of the period. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The asymmetrical facade of well detailed brickwork has a massive arch at ground level and other openings with semi-circular arches, all characteristic of the style. The square campanile is a more Italianate element, which enables the post office to be a focus of the townscape.' A two- storey polychrome brick building with four storey campanile in Italian Romanesque Revival style built in 1892 and designed by W. L. Vemon. The facade is of asymmetrical design dominated by the tower. A massive arched opening leads to the posting boxes. Beautifully detailed brickwork and facade is embellished with sandstone royal insignia, various arched openings, string courses and a sandstone plinth. Sixteen pane windows. Terracotta tiled roof. To sum up some of the characteristics of Vernon's style, emphasis must be placed on the use of brick and stone dressing as building media, gables rather than parapets, irregular massing of volumetric shapes, restricted use of ornamentation in most buildings after the turn of the century, frequent use of the plain rounded arch and semicircular windows: all of these allied to a generally picturesque modest domestic air. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. In 1869 a post office was situated at the railway station. Postal services were previously conducted through general stores. In 1886, a new building was erected at the railway station and in 1892, the present day Post Office, designed by W. L. Vernon, was opened. This post office as an essential service has been associated with the people of Burwood for more than 100 years and a post office of some sort has been located in the immediate vicinity since the inception of the Municipality. The clock, added to the tower shortly after the Post Office was built, has played an important role in the lives of the community. Since the clock stopped working after Australia Post vacated the premises many people have contacted Council to ask that it be kept working and at the right time. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The square campanile is a more Italianate element, which enables the post office to be a focus of the townscape.' Burwood Post Office is a landmark building, clearly visible from many parts of the Municipality and has become an icon for the community, which uses it as a logo on many documents and other places both now and in the past. It is arguably the most well known building in Burwood. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. An excellent example of a suburban post office designed by the government architect W. L. Vernon in the Federation Anglo Dutch Revival style. The asymmetrical facade of well detailed brickwork has a massive arch at ground level and other openings with semi- circular arches, all characteristic of the style.

He is best known for his richly textured paintings in an intricate, highly colored style that is not easy even though everything is readily intelligible: male and females characters, beasts, forests, architectural structures and artifacts. Daniel Giralt- Miracle, Vilallonga: Les lieux du r√™ve / Cloister of Dreams, De Moura Sobral, Lu√≠s Editions Broquet (bilingual edition), Montr√©al, 1993 Vilallonga's iconography draws from a broad and complex painting tradition ranging from Romanesque art, the Renaissance, and Surrealism, while maintaining his own contemporary style.. His work is sometimes related to Symbolism and his production is always enhanced by the contributions of abstraction. He works with the \\"inner eye\\" which Freud described as the most profound and the most intelligent, in a sojourn through nature and man's hidden interior. Daniel Giralt-Miracle, Vilallonga: Les lieux du r√™ve / Cloister of Dreams, De Moura Sobral, Lu√≠s Editions Broquet (bilingual edition), Montr√©al, 1993 Vilallonga exhibited widely in Europe, Canada, and the United States and his oeuvre includes bronze and resin sculpture, watercolor paintings, design objects, and different print mediums including screen print, etching, lithography, and digital art. He was awarded the National Order of Qu√©bec in 2011 and Fill Predilecte in Santa Coloma de Farners, Spain in 2015.  Life and career  The fourth child of Salvador de Vilallonga i Corominas and Maria Dolors Rosell i Planes de Farners, Jes√∫s Carles Isidre de Vilallonga i Rosell was born on March 10, 1927. His father was a wealthy landowner whose family documents, now deposited in the Arxiu Comarcal de la Selva, date back to the 13th century. His parents were patrons of the arts and often had artists vacation at their summer home, the 15th-century family estate Mas Par√©s located in the village of Sant Mart√≠ Sapresa. At the age of five, Vilallonga made his first drawings there alongside the Catalan impressionist painter Joaquim Mir. Cavall blau, 1973-1980 The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) shattered the family's bucolic lifestyle.Vilallonga, Descharnes, Robert Editorial Juventud (French and English editions), Barcelona, 1971, p. 9. When Vilallonga was eleven years old, his father, Salvador de Vilallonga, who had been in hiding during much of the war, first in a secret part of the house, then later in artist's studio in Barcelona, was killed when he tried to cross over to France through the Pyrenees. Maria Dolors, with her eight children, left Santa Coloma de Farners and relocated to an apartment in Girona Vilallonga: Les lieux du r√™ve / Cloister of Dreams, De Moura Sobral, Lu√≠s Editions Broquet (bilingual edition), Montr√©al, 1993. In 1948, Vilallonga moved to Barcelona where he studied drawing along with Joan Pon√ß at Ram√≥n Rogent‚Äôs studio and took architecture classes at the University of Barcelona. Convinced that he wanted to dedicate his life to being an artist, he continued to exhibit and win prizes for his watercolor paintings, painted frescos in two different chapels, designed murals and mosaics for a large hotel on the Mediterranean coast, and studied painting with Marcel Gromaire at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He traveled throughout Europe, stopping in Rome to visit his friend the painter Jaume Muxart, and finally ended up in Copenhagen, selling his recently painted watercolors in the squares of major cities along the way to pay his expenses. In 1954, he accepted a mural commission in Montr√©al and that move proved decisive to his art careerhttps://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/continuite/1995-n66-continuite1053726/17241ac.pdf. To cover his expenses, he had the ingenious idea of painting watercolors of the wealthy homes in Westmount and selling the paintings to their owners. He sang and played the guitar in clubs, designed the costumes and set designs for a ballet at the National Ballet of Canada, and briefly taught Spanish at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. The Birth of Stars, 2000 In 1958, Vilallonga signed an exclusive contract with Max Stern, owner of the prestigious Dominion Gallery in Montr√©al, who was responsible for introducing the contemporary European artists Henry Moore, Marino Marini, Van Dongen and Picabia in Canada . His early paintings were in oil in an expressionistic style, alongside his trademark egg tempera paintings on board. Vilallonga‚Äôs contract with the gallery continued for thirty years until the death of Stern. Vilallonga married his first wife Madeleine Kirouac, a Canadian widow with two young daughters Manon and Lyzanne Alain Vilallonga: Les lieux du r√™ve / Cloister of Dreams, De Moura Sobral, Lu√≠s Editions Broquet (bilingual edition), Montr√©al, 1993, in 1959 and they had two more daughters Marta and Salvana Vilallonga: Les lieux du r√™ve / Cloister of Dreams, De Moura Sobral, Lu√≠s Editions Broquet (bilingual edition), Montr√©al, 1993. Vilallonga continued to paint prolifically while dividing his time between Cadaqu√©s, Montr√©al, and Barcelona. In 1982, Vilallonga met Katherine Slusher, an American writer and art historian living in Barcelona. They were married in Saint-J√©r√¥me, Quebec in 1989. In 1992, they spent a year in Syracuse, New York, where Vilallonga studied sculpture under Rodger Mack and produced several bronze and aluminum sculptures at the Syracuse University foundry. The couple returned to Barcelona where Vilallonga worked for the next twenty years at his two studios in the Raval and became integrated in the social milieu of the Ramblas. The last five years of his life, he worked on large scale drawings at their home, until his death in 2018. Jes√∫s Carles de Vilallonga‚Äôs paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings are the subject of numerous books and documentaries and are in museums, universities, and private collections throughout the worldJes√∫s de Vilallonga, Drawings, Symbols and Signs, Museu Casa de la Paraula, Santa Coloma de Farners, 2015. His extensive body of work has been exhibited in individual exhibitions at the Lefevre Gallery in London, Sagittarius Gallery in New York, Galer√≠a Juana Mord√≥ in Madrid, Art Contemporain in Paris, Dau al Set in Barcelona, and multiple galleries in Canada.

It was built by George Hoskins. It is also known as St. Cloud and Site and St Cloud and site. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Burwood= Parramatta Road was first created in 1791, a vital land (cf water) artery between Sydney Cove and Rose Hill's settlement and crops. Liverpool Road opened in 1814 as Governor Macquarie's Great South Road. Its winding route reflects pre-existing land grant boundaries. To Burwood's north over Parramatta Road was Longbottom Government Farm, staffed by convicts. This grew to over on heavily timbered flat, sloping to swamps on Hen & Chicken Bay. Commissioner Bigge recorded how valuable timber (ironbark) was cut and sawn on the spot, conveyed to Sydney in boats by the river. \\"Charcoal for the forges and foundries is likewise prepared here\\" he noted. Two land grants were critical on Burwood's clay: Captain Thomas Rowley's Burwood Farm estate and William Faithful's grant to its south in Enfield covered most of modern Burwood. Rowley, adjutant of the NSW Corps, named it after the farm he'd lived on in Cornwall. 1799 and subsequent grants brought it to but he continued to live at Kingston Farm in Newtown until his death in 1806. He'd bought some of the first Spanish merinos brought from the Cape Colony in 1797, others being sold to Macarthur, Marsden & Cox. The southern boundary of his farm was approximately Woodside Avenue & Fitzroy Street. Under Rowley's will the estate passed to his three underage children- executors Dr Harris & Major Johnstone were both involved in the 1808 Bligh rebellion and returned to England for the court martial. Governor Macquarie appointed Thomas Moore as guardian and executor. In 1812 he wrongfully auctioned the estate. It was bought by Sydney businessman Alexander Riley. He's believed to have built Burwood Villa in 1814 (perhaps on older (1797) foundations of Rowley's shepherd's cottage) and lived here until departing for England in 1817. In 1824 Joseph Lycett described the estate. had been cleared for pasture. Lycett in Views of Australia described \\"a garden of 4 acres in full cultivation, containing upwards of three hundred Trees, bearing the following choice fruits, viz. The Orange, Citron, Lemon, Pomegranate, Loquat, Guava, Peaches, Nectarines, Apricots, Apples, Pears, the Cherry, Plums, Figs, Chestnuts, Almonds, Medlars, Quinces; with abundance of Raspberries, Strawberries, and the finest Melons. &c;\\". Until the 1830s Burwood consisted of a few inns along the highways and two or three huge, undeveloped estates within the next 20 years these began to break up, attracting settlers and encouraging the growth of embryo villages at Burwood & Enfield. Riley died in 1833 and Rowley's children, now of age, started legal proceedings and regained possession of the estate. It was divided between Thomas jnr., John, John Lucas* and Henry Biggs. Almost at once they subdivided into lots of for country homes and small farms. In 1834 Burwood estate was held by John Lucas, husband of Thomas's daughter Mary Rowley), who divided of his into small allotments for sale. Streets such as Webb, Lucas Road, Wentworth Road, & Strathfield's The Boulevarde reflect the boundaries of these subdivisions/estates. To the south (including the land later the Appian Way) was William Faithful's grant of (1808) at \\"Liberty Plains\\". Faithful was a private in the NSW Corps: discharged in 1799 he became Captain Foveaux's farm manager, and this connection got him the grant. Apart from of Sarah Nelson's on Malvern Hill (Croydon), Faithful's Farm extended from Rowley's farm to Cooks River and west to Punchbowl Road. The government retained a right to build a road through it (doing so in 1815: Liverpool or the Great South Road), and to cut \\"such timber as may be deemed fit for naval purposes\\" - the area was thick with tall ironbark. Faithful exchanged it in 1815. Alexander Riley bought his north of the new road incorporating it into his Burwood estate. This was jointly owned by the Rowley family after 1833 and had no streets across it, only a few tracks. Despite opening up of the Rowley estate there was little settlement in Burwood between the two highways before 1860. Sydney Railway Company opened the first rail to Parramatta in 1855. Burwood \\"station\\" (just west of Ashfield station, one of the first stations) was a wooden platform near a level crossing over the grassy track that was Neich's Lane* (later Burwood Rd). This was beside \\"the newly laid out township of Cheltenham\\". Speedy transport meant subdivision and consolidation followed, filling out the area. Burwood's biggest growth spurt was between 1874 & 1900 (Burwood's population was, respectively: 1200-7400, an increase not matched since. *1835 maps show this as the only track between Parramatta / Liverpool Roads in Burwood. Burwood's first public school was . In 1843 land on Burwood Rd. was granted to the Anglican Church for a school. St. Mary's Catholic Church opened in 1846, a Presbyterian Church in 1857 and St. Paul's Anglican in 1871. Mansions of the 1870s+ such as The Priory were due to a firm belief in its health-giving climate, compared to the smog and crowding of the city suburbs. They were built as quasi-ancestral estates, perhaps in blissful ignorance of how quickly suburbs can evolve. Living was primitive: no street lighting (1883+), home lighting by candle or lamp (oil, kerosene after 1860), no gas (1882+), no piped water (1886+), home wells/tanks, few bathrooms, no indoor toilets, with pans (1880+) replacing outdoor cess pits. The 1880s+ was the era of the debates that led to Australia's fractious states combining into a single Federation, declared at Sydney's Centennial Park, in 1901. Skilled tradesmen and materials were plentiful and comparatively cheap, and combined with the improvement in building techniques associated with cavity walls, damp-courses and terracotta tiled rooves, provided the means for an era of intense building activity. Unlike the Victorian era's large commercial and Government building, the main thrust of the Federation era was constructing new suburbs around Sydney harbour with shops for the middle classes. Between 1889 and 1918 Australia's population swelled from 3 to 5 million triggering an urgent need for housing. Suburban spread was greatly assisted by expansion of the public transport system of trams, ferries and trams, which formed a well- integrated pre-car transport system. Rapid suburban growth brought increased interest in town planning and the British concept (Ebenezer Howard's 'Garden City') of the Garden Suburb, spurred on by the Federal Capital Competition of 1912. 1913's arrival from North America of winners, Walter Burley & Marion Mahony Griffin, saw formation of the Town Planning Association of NSW, with architect John Sulman as president. Founding members Sulman and J. P. Fitzgerald were among witnesses at the 1900 Royal Commission into the Improvement of the City of Sydney and suburbs. This made the first attempt at a comprehensive review of Sydney's problems, gathering many reform ideas. It recognised the relationship between planning and local government and advocated introduction of a town planning bill along the lines of John Burns' 1900 English Bill. Some recommendations, such as introducing building regulations for the whole metropolitan area \\"to prevent the straggling of suburbs and to ensure development along harmonious lines\\" went into 1919's Local Government Act. The \\"Garden Suburb\\" came to mean a suburb with special areas zoned for different uses, e.g.: residential and commercial; an absence of attached terraces with free-standing houses, wide tree-lined streets, \\"nature strips\\" on footpaths, parks reserves and gardens. Much-derided rear lanes and rights-of-way became redundant with sewerage and the provision of side access between houses. Verandas and bay windows were means of integrating house & garden. Tree-lined streets such as Burwood Rd., The Appian Way or The Boulevard in Strathfield were in marked contrast to most development in Australian cities of the late 19th century.Fraser, Hugh, in Heritage Council of NSW, 1981-4, amended and added to by Stuart Read, 17/5/2008 with excerpts from Eric Dunlop (1975). =St. Cloud= St. Cloud was built by industrialist George Hoskins, remembered for his work establishing the steel industry (Australian Iron & Steel Company) in Lithgow and Port Kembla with his brother Charles Hoskins and for his Appian Way subdivision adjoining St. Cloud - the Hoskins estate (1904+). George & his brother were involved in constructing the open aqueducts carrying Sydney's Nepean Water supply to its suburbs (from 1886) and were well aware of the benefits of reticulated waters supply on suburbs such as Burwood, Croydon, Concord. A water main was laid down Liverpool Road (nearby to the south of St.Cloud), down Burwood Road (past St. Cloud) and to Parramatta Road. George and his brother Charles moved to Burwood in 1893, George building and moving into St. Cloud and Charles to Illyria (now Hollyrood), a mansion on The Boulevarde to the west (today part of Santa Sabina Convent, Strathfield).

Inscription with the name of goddess Vesunna In inscriptions found in P√©rigueux, Vesunna is identified with the Roman guardian goddess Tutela. Vesunna received votive and dedicatory offerings from her worshippers; otherwise little is known of the specifics of her cult. She had a temple in the city that bore her name. Vesunna was worshipped especially by the Gaulish Celtic tribe known as the Petrocorii, whose name survives in that of the modern French city of P√©rigueux, located just north of her great temple.  Etymology  Inscription with the name of goddess Vesunna and dedicator Secundus Vesunna‚Äôs name is likely to derive from the Proto-Celtic *wesu or ‚Äògood‚Äô. The theonym is the direct heir to another goddess of the same city of Sianna, and derives from vesannus, -a, -um - ‚Äòcruel, furious, excited, unstoppable‚Äô for Sianna as a definition relative to the mistress of wildlife and as a goddess of the hunt. Vesunna is also called Tutela, indicating her role as a patron and defender of the city.  Similar theonymes  There is one inscription from Baden-Baden with the invocation of goddess Visuna, probably an iscriptive variant of goddess Vesunna from Perigueux.

Randolph Llewellyn Hodgson (24 January 1870 ‚Äì 6 December 1952) was an English Anglican vicar and writer, who contributed for more than 20 years to The Cricketer magazine under the pen-name of A Country Vicar. Early life Hodgson was born in Playford, Suffolk, where his father Christopher was a clergyman, but the family moved to Yorkshire, where he spent most of his childhood.\\"Obituary: Rev. R. Ll. Hodgson\\", The Cricketer, Spring Annual, 1953, pp. 80‚Äì81. He went to Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1890, and graduated BA in 1895. A good rugby player, he was prevented from obtaining his Blue by a leg injury he suffered while playing rugby soon after he arrived at Cambridge. The injury virtually crippled him throughout his undergraduate years and continued to affect him for the remainder of his life.Wisden 1954, p. 931.A Country Vicar, \\"Cricket Memories\\", The Cricketer, 10 May 1924, pp. 53‚Äì54. After graduating he spent the next five years in Austria-Hungary as English tutor to Franz Joseph, son of the Prince of Thurn and Taxis. In order to dispel some of the ignorance the English had about the region, he wrote two books on his travels there, which were copiously illustrated by Princess Marie of Thurn and Taxis (1855‚Äì1934).Susan Hansen, \\"British Radicals Knowledge of, and Attitudes to Austria-Hungary 1890‚Äì1914\\", The Meijo Review (Meijo University, Nagoya), 11 (2012), 1‚Äì45. In 1902 he co-wrote, with Florence Darnley, the wife of the English Test cricket captain Ivo Bligh, a romantic novel titled Elma Trevor. In the novel, which is set partly in Austria, the eponymous heroine, \\"loved by one man ... marrie[s] another, and in the end discovers that she is made for a third\\". Clergyman and cricket writer Hodgson was ordained in 1906 and served first as curate to his father, who at the time was the rector at Campsea Ashe in Suffolk. He played a few times as a lower-order batsman for Suffolk County Cricket Club in the Minor Counties Championship between 1904 and 1907, and served as club secretary around the same time. He continued to play club cricket for many years. He later served several parishes for short periods as curate: Ashill in Norfolk, Milton in Hampshire, St Paul's in South Hampstead, and St Katherine Coleman in the City of London. He became Vicar of South Baddesley, Hampshire, in 1917 and remained there until he retired in 1946. He began writing as \\"A Country Vicar\\" in The Cricketer in the January 1924 issueA Country Vicar, \\"Cricket Memories\\", The Cricketer, January 1924, pp. 15‚Äì17. and continued until 1948.A Country Vicar, \\"Cricket and the Church\\", The Cricketer, Spring Annual 1948, pp. 22‚Äì23. He wrote his reminiscences of the cricket he had played and watched at village, club and county level, and the cricket he had watched at first-class and Test level, often in the company of his wife, who was knowledgeable about cricket and enthusiastic. He collected these reminiscences into three books.\\"Reviews\\", The Cricketer, Annual, 1946-47, p. 78.

For Bangladesh this decade was characterized by strife among the political parties over the caretaker government system for managing the national elections. Continued rapid urbanisation and globalization influenced the socio-economic and cultural activities of the country in this decade. Politics and National life =Political transition= In July 2001, the incumbent Bangladesh Awami League government stepped down to allow a caretaker government to preside over parliamentary elections. Political violence that had increased during the Bangladesh Awami League government's tenure continued to increase through the summer in the run up to the election. In August, The leader of the opposition, Khaleda Zia and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina agreed during a visit of former President Jimmy Carter to respect the results of the election, join Parliament win or lose, forswear the use of hartals (violently enforced strikes) as political tools, and if successful in forming a government allow for a more meaningful role for the opposition in Parliament. The caretaker government was successful in containing the violence, which allowed a parliamentary general election to be successfully held on 1 October 2001. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. =Second Khaleda administration, 2001‚Äì2006= The Four Party Alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party won over a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Begum Khaleda Zia was sworn in on 10 October 2001, as Prime Minister for the third time (first in 1991, second after the 15 February 1996 elections). Despite her August 2001 pledge and all election monitoring groups declaring the election free and fair, Sheikh Hasina condemned the election, rejected the results, and boycotted Parliament. In 2002, however, she led her party legislators back to Parliament, but the Bangladesh Awami League again walked out in June 2003 to protest derogatory remarks about Hasina by a State Minister and the allegedly partisan role of the Parliamentary Speaker. In June 2004, the AL returned to Parliament without having any of their demands met. They then attended Parliament irregularly before announcing a boycott of the entire June 2005 budget session. On 17 August 2005, near-synchronized blasts of improvised explosive devices in 63 out of 64 administrative districts targeted mainly government buildings and killed two persons. An extremist Islamist group named Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) claimed responsibility for the blasts, which aimed to press home JMB's demand for a replacement of the secular legal system with Islamic sharia courts. Subsequent attacks on the courts in several districts killed 28 people, including judges, lawyers, and police personnel guarding the courts. A government campaign against the Islamic extremists led to the arrest of hundreds of senior and mid-level JMB leaders. Six top JMB leaders were tried and sentenced to death for their role in the murder of two judges; another leader was tried and sentenced to death in absentia in the same case. In February 2006, the AL returned to Parliament, demanded early elections and requested significant changes in the electoral and caretaker government systems to stop alleged moves by the ruling coalition to rig the next election. The AL blamed the BNP for several high-profile attacks on opposition leaders and asserted the BNP was bent on eliminating Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League as a viable force. The BNP and its allies accused the AL of maligning Bangladesh at home and abroad out of jealousy over the government's performance on development and economic issues. Dialogue between the Secretaries General of the main ruling and opposition parties failed to sort out the electoral reform issues. =Political crisis and Caretaker government, 2006‚Äì2008= Hamid Karzai, Pervez Musharraf, and Fakhruddin Ahmed at the Annual Meeting 2008 of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland The months preceding the planned January 22, 2007, elections were filled with political unrest and controversy. Following the end of Khaleda Zia's government in late October 2006, there were protests and strikes, during which 40 people were killed in the following month, over uncertainty about who would head the caretaker government. The caretaker government had difficulty bringing the all parties to the table. Awami League and its allies protested and alleged that the caretaker government favoured the BNP. The interim period was marked by violence and strikes. Presidential Advisor Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury negotiated with Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia and brought all the parties to the planned 22 January 2007 parliamentary elections. Later Hussain Muhammad Ershad's nomination was cancelled; as a result, the Grand Alliance withdrew its candidates en masse on the last day possible. They demanded to have voters' lists published. Later in the month, the president Iajuddin Ahmed imposed a state of emergency. Iajuddin Ahmed resigned from the post of chief adviser, under the pressure of Bangladesh Army, and appointed Fakhruddin Ahmed, the new chief adviser. Political activity was prohibited. The military- backed government worked to develop graft and corruption cases against leaders and members of both major parties. In March 2007, Khaleda Zia's two sons, who both had positions in Bangladesh Nationalist Party, were charged with corruption. Hasina was charged with graft and extortion in April 2007, and a day later, Khaleda Zia was charged with graft as well. There was attempt by Bangladesh Army chief Moeen U Ahmed, the head of Anti-Terrorism division of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence Brigadier General ATM Amin, and Director of Directorate General of Forces Intelligence Brigadier General Chowdhury Fazlul Bari to remove Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia from politics. Former Army Chief, General Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, was made the head of Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission. The Anti Corruption Commission and the Bangladesh Election Commission were strengthened by the caretaker government. On 27 August 2007 violence broke out in the University of Dhaka campus between students and soldiers of Bangladesh Army. Students called strikes and burned effigies of the army chief. Police attacked the students and physically assaulted Acting Vice-chancellor Prof AFM Yusuf Haider and other faculty members of the University of Dhaka. Students were joined in demonstration by street vendors and slum residents who were evicted by the government. Bangladesh Army agreed to the demands of the protesters and removed the Army camp from the University of Dhaka campus. Students and teachers expressed dissatisfaction over the continued state of emergency in Bangladesh. =Second Hasina administration= Sheikh Hasina with Vladimir Putin in Moscow The Awami league won national election on 29 December 2008 as part of a larger electoral alliance that also included the Jatiya Party led by former military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad as well as some leftist parties. According to the Official Results, Bangladesh Awami League won 230 out of 299 constituencies, and together with its allies, had a total of 262 parliamentary seats. The Awami League and its allies received 57% of the total votes cast. The AL alone got 48%, compared to 36% of the other major alliance led by the BNP which by itself got 33% of the votes. Sheikh Hasina, as party head, is the new Prime Minister. Her term of office began on 7 January 2009 after Fakhruddin Ahmed. The new cabinet had several new faces, including three women in prominent positions: Dr Dipu Moni (Foreign Minister), Matia Chowdhury (Agriculture Minister) and Sahara Khatun (Home Minister). Younger MPs with a link to assassinated members of the 1972‚Äì1975 AL government are Syed Ashraful Islam, son of Syed Nazrul Islam, Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, son of Sheikh Fazlul Huq Moni, and Tanjim Ahmad Sohel Taj, son of Tajuddin Ahmad. Since 2009, the Awami League government faced several major political challenges, including BDR (border security force) mutiny, power crisis, unrest in garments industry and stock market fluctuations. Judicial achievements for the party included restoring 1972 constitution (set by the first Awami League government), beginning of war crimes trials, and guilty verdict in 1975 assassination trial. According to the Nielsen 2-year survey, 50% felt the country was moving in the right direction, and 36% gave the government a favourable rating. Army convoy gathering behind the tanks near Abahani ground on 26 February 2009 Bangladesh Rifles revolt On 25 and 26 February 2009, section of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), a paramilitary force mainly tasked with guarding the borders of Bangladesh, staged a mutiny that brought the national life to a standstill. The rebelling BDR soldiers took over the BDR headquarters in Pilkhana, killing the BDR Director-General and some army officers. They also fired on civilians, held many of their officers hostage, vandalised property and looted valuables. By the second day, unrest had spread to 12 other towns and cities. Eventually, a total of seventy-four people were killed. Among them were 57 army officers seconded to the BDR. The Chief of the BDR, the Deputy Chief and all 16 Sector Commanders died during the revolt. The mutiny ended as the mutineers surrendered their arms and released the hostages after a series of discussions and negotiations with the government. Administrative Division Divisions of Bangladesh in 2000s decade. Throughout the decade Bangladesh was administratively divided into 6 divisions, namely Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet which were further subdivided into a total of 64 districts (See List of districts of Bangladesh). Demographics Based on World Development Indicators published by the World Bank the population of Bangladesh grew from 129 million at the beginning of the decade to 150 million by the end. This signifies an annual population growth rate of 1.5%. Population density increased from 991 to 1156 per sq. km. The urban population was 23.6% of the total at the beginning, which ended up at 29.7%. Dhaka, the largest city, with a population of 10.3 million, accounted for 33.1% of the total urban population by 2009. United Nations World Population Prospects show that the population growth rate was in decreasing trend (from 2.0% per annum to 1.1%), primarily due to reduction in fertility rate (births per woman) from 3.2 to 2.4. Life expectancy at birth increased from 65.3 years to 69.8 years with Child (0-5) mortality reducing from 87 per 1,000 births to 53. Age dependency ratio (% of working-age population) changed from 69.2% to 59.3% by the end of the decade. Climate =Temperature and Precipitation= Compared to prior decade the average winter temperature from December to February increased by about 0.6 degree Celsius leading to overall average annual temperature increase by about 0.3 degree Celsius. Average rainfall decreased for July-Sep resulting in overall average annual rainfall decrease by about 31 cm. =Natural Disasters= Cyclone Sidr making landfall in Bangladesh. The extremely severe tropical cyclone, named Cyclone Sidr, was the major natural disaster in this decade. Sidr formed in the central Bay of Bengal, and quickly turned into a Category-5 equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. The storm eventually made landfall in Bangladesh on November 15, 2007, causing large-scale evacuations.http://www.bangladesh- web.com/view.php?hidRecord=177458 At least 3,447 deaths have been blamed on the storm,. Save the Children estimated the number of deaths associated with the cyclone to be between 3,100 and 10,000, while the Red Crescent Society reported on November 18 that the number of deaths could be up to 15,000. International groups pledged US$95 million to repair the damage, which was estimated at $1.7 billion (2007 USD). Besides there have been multiple flood events throughout the decade. In late summer 2002, heavy monsoon rains led to massive flooding in eastern India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, killing over 500 people and leaving millions homeless. There were estimated 3.5 million victims of flooding in 30 out of 64 districts.Bangladesh: Flood Situation Report 31 Jul 2002, World Vision In 2004, monsoon flood intensified from April to July leading to the destruction of the rice crop in the northern region just before it was harvested. Water persisted in these regions for 3 to 4 weeks whilst gradually draining southwards, severely flooding most of Central Bangladesh. The high water level and widest extent of the flood was reached on 24 July affecting 39 out of 64 districts and 36 million people. In 2007 a series of floods impacted South Asia including Bangladesh. Last accessed 3 August 2007. During this flood an estimated 7.5 million people had fled their homes, more than 50,000 people had diarrhoea or other waterborne diseases and more than 400,000 people took temporary shelters. Economy =National Income and Balance of Payment= Bangladesh GDP was USD 67.0 billion in 2000, which grew to USD 109.2 billion in 2009 (in 2010 constant dollar) signifying a 5.0% annual growth. Agricultural Sector contributed to 23.8% of GDP in the beginning of the decade, which decreased to 17.9% by the end. During the same period contribution from the industrial sector increased from 23.3% to 26.4% and that of the service sector increased from 52.9% to 55.7%. Per capita GDP increased from USD 509 to USD 726 (in 2010 constant dollar). According to World Development Indicators published by the World Bank, on 2010 constant dollar basis, Bangladesh used to export USD 4.0 billion (12.3% of GDP) worth of goods and services as of 2000, which grew at annual average rate of 16.3% to USD 18.3 billion (16.9% of GDP) in 2009. The increase can be attributed to rapid growth in export oriented ready-made garments sector. During the same time import of goods and services grew from USD 6.4 billion (17.0% of GDP) to USD 24.9 billion (23.2% of GDP) - also driven by raw material import for ready-made garments industry. Over the decade, Foreign Direct Investment and Personal Remittances Receipt averaged 0.68% and 6.61% of GDP; while, total Reserve averaged at 21.6% of external debt and 2.9 month's coverage of import. Gross National Income (at 2010 constant dollar) grew from USD 69.3 billion to USD 117.8 billion over the decade. At the beginning of this period External Debt stock (of which concessional debt was 94.8%) was 28.3% of Gross National Income (GNI) and External Debt Service burden was 1.4% of GNI. By the end of the decade, External Debt stock (of which concessional debt now was 78.8%) stood at 23.0% of GNI and External Debt Service burden was 0.9% of the same. During the same period Military expenditure decreased from 1.4% to 1.2% of GNI. =Agriculture= Aggregate value addition from agricultural sector was USD 13.0 billion in 2000 (in 2010 constant USD), which grew at average annual rate of 3.6% to USD 18.5 billion by 2009 (in the same constant USD). During this decade, crop production grew at an annual average rate of 3.1% driven by cereal production increase from 39.5 million metric tons to 49.7 million (implying annual growth of 2.3%) - enabled by improvement in cereal yield from 3384.4 kg per hectare to 4176 kg. At the same time livestock production grew at 3.2% per annum and fisheries production increased at annual rate of 5.7%. Altogether these contributed to overall food production increase by annualized rate of 3.1%. =Industrial and Service Sectors= Net value addition from industrial sector, which stood at USD 14.0 billion in 2000 (in 2010 constant USD), grew at average annual rate of 6.7% to USD 26.9 billion by 2009 (in the same constant USD basis). Manufacturing sector contributed 64.3% of industrial value added in the beginning of this period and it gradually changed to 64.8% by the end. There were 8,293 recorded industrial design applications by Bangladeshi residents in this decade, more than double of that from earlier decade. As of 2005-06 there were 34,701 industrial establishments in the country generating employment for 3.34 million. On the other hand, net value addition from the service sector amounting USD 35.8 billion in 2000, also grew at average annual rate of 5.0% and stood at USD 58.4 billion by 2009 (in 2010 constant USD). Major business enterprises that started journey in Bangladesh in this decade include Western Marine Shipyard in 2000, RanksTel and TeleTalk in 2004, United Airways in 2005, Best Air, NovoAir and Regent Power in 2007 and Walton in 2008. Infrastructure =Transportation and Communications= The construction of new roads somewhat slowed down in 2000s compared to earlier decade, but several major bridges were constructed. The arterial road network under the jurisdiction of Roads and Highways department (R&HD;) in 2001 was about 20,854 km including 3,144 km of national highways, 1,746 km of regional roads and 15,964 km of Type A feeder roads. By 2011, there were about 21,000 km of highways (including over 3,478 km of national highways and 4,221 km of regional highways) as well as 18,258 bridges to connect the roads. In December 2000, over 406,000 different types of motorised vehicles were plying on the roads of Bangladesh, and the number rose to 852,416 by 2005. Major bridges constructed in the 2000s include Syed Nazrul Islam Bridge over Meghna River in 2002, Lalon Shah Bridge over Padma River in 2004, Khan Jahan Ali Bridge over Rupsha River in 2005 and Mukterpur Bridge over Dhaleshwari River in 2008 (see List of bridges in Bangladesh). Inaugural of Maitree Express train of the Bangladesh Railway on April 14, 2008, at Dhaka Cantonment. The opening of Bangabandhu Jamuna Bridge in 1998 opened up the scope for expanding the railways, especially for connecting the Bhuapur end of the bridge with Dhaka via tangail. This required a connectivity between Broad-gauge (BG) lines in the west of Jamuna to the Metre-gauge (MG) line in the east. Most part of the construction works of this km long section was completed by 2001. On 14 August 2003, direct BB train communication between East zone (Joydevpur) and West Zone (Rajshahi) was started. In 2008, direct passenger train ‚ÄúMaitree Express‚Äù between Dhaka and Kolkata was established. From 14 April 2009, BG Trains started coming to Dhaka directly after Dhaka-Joydevpur section was converted into dual gauge. With 3,800 kilometers of navigable rivers during the dry season and 6,000 kilometers during the monsoon season, the waterway network in Bangladesh remained an important part of the transport network. As of 2005, inland water transport was accounting for 8% of the passenger transport and 16% of the freight transport across all forms of ground transport in Bangladesh.Bangladesh Transport Sector Review (The World Bank publications), People's Republic of Bangladesh: Revival of Inland Water Transport-Options and Strategies, 2007 With multiple private sector carriers in operation along with the national carrier Biman, air transport sector finally started to take off in this decade. As of 1999, there were 5,900 registered carrier departures worldwide which increased to 16,399 by 2009. During the same period number of passenger carried increased from 1.22 million to about 1.41 million per annum. In the beginning of the decade there were 491,303 fixed telephone line subscription in the country - which increased to 1,234,895 by the end signifying 0.82 lines per 100 people. However, there was rapid growth in mobile cellular subscriptions in this decade. By 2009 there were 51,359,315 mobile subscriptions signifying 34.14 lines per 100 people. =Energy= In 2000 per capital electric power consumption was 101.5 kWh, which increased to 219.2 kWh by 2009. During the same period per capita energy usage increased from 138.8 kg of oil equivalent to 187.3 kg and fossil fuel energy consumption increased from 57.9% to 69.0% of total. In the year 2000, the electricity produced in the country was coming from: hydroelectric sources: 4.7%, natural gas sources: 88.8%, oil sources: 6.5% and coal sources: 0.0%. By 2009 the distribution changed to hydroelectric sources: 1.1%, natural gas sources: 91.6%, oil sources: 4.3% and coal sources: 2.9%. =Financial Services= As of 2008, in addition to the money and capital markets, the financial sector of Bangladesh included a number of insurance, pensions, and microfinance institutions. However, the sector was dominated by the banking industry which comprised of 4 state-owned commercial banks (SCBs), 5 state- owned specialized banks, 30 domestic private commercial banks (PCBs), 9 foreign commercial banks, and 29 non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) under the supervision of Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of the country. In the insurance sub-sector, 21 companies provided general insurance while 6 other provided life insurance; but most of the assets in the sector was commanded by the two large, state-owned companies‚Äî the Sadharan Bima Corporation for general insurance and the Jiban Bima Corporation for life insurance. In order to reinforce the Government's ongoing financial sector reform programs from earlier decade (see here), Bangladesh bank administered the World Bank‚Äôs Financial Institutions Development Project from 2000 to 2006, which, according to Asian Development Bank, enabled \\"substantial progress towards sustainable financing of private sector initiatives to accelerate industrial growth in the country\\". There were developments in the Capital Market as well. In the beginning of the decade, shares and debentures of 442 companies were traded in the equity market (258 in Dhaka Stock Exchange and 184 in Chittagong Stock Exchange). The listing and trading of debt securities were minimum. The market capitalisation on 30 June 2000 in the two stock exchanges was Tk 80.86 billion and Tk 53.12 billion, equivalent to about $1.62 billion and $1.06 billion respectively. The establishment and incorporation of the Central Depository Bangladesh Ltd (CDBL) as a public limited company in August 2000 and the incorporation of the Central Depository System (CDS) as an independent company in January 2004 helped increase operational efficiency of the stock markets. From 2007 onwards, in the aftermath of the largest IPO at the time, that of Grameenphone Ltd., the market began to appreciate culminating in a significant bubble in 2010. In 2010 alone, the DSE was the second-highest performing market globally, with the general index, DGEN, posting a 92 per cent year-on- year return. However the bubble was short-lived, as the market began to slow from December 8, 2010, beginning a protracted phase of contraction.

The campaign was militarily successful for the British and led to the signing of the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 between the British and the Sheikhs of what was then known as the 'Pirate Coast', would become known as the 'Trucial Coast' after this treaty and the territory that today comprises the United Arab Emirates.  Background  After decades of incidents where British shipping had fallen foul of the aggressive Al Qasimi, an expeditionary force embarked for Ras Al Khaimah in 1809. This campaign led to the signing of a peace treaty between the British and Hussan Bin Rahmah, the Al Qasimi leader. This broke down in 1815. J. G. Lorimer contends that after the dissolution of the arrangement, the Al Qasimi \\"now indulged in a carnival of maritime lawlessness, to which even their own previous record presented no parallel\\". This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In 1815, the crew of a British Indian vessel were captured by Al Qasimi near Muscat and most of the crew were murdered. Then, on 6 January Al Qasimi captured an armed pattamar, the Deriah Dowlut, off the coast of Dwarka and murdered 17 of its 38 Indian crew. In the Red Sea, in 1816, three British-flagged Indian merchant vessels from Surat were taken and most of the crews killed. Following the incident involving the Surat vessels (said to have been carried out by Amir Ibrahim, a cousin to the Al Qasimi Ruler Hassan Bin Rahmah) an investigation took place and Ariel was despatched to Ras Al Khaimah from Bushire, to where it returned with a flat denial of involvement in the affair from the Al Qasimi who were also at pains to point out they had not undertaken to recognise 'idolatrous Hindus' as British subjects, let alone anyone from the West Coast of India other than Bombay and Mangalore. A small squadron assembled off Ras Al Khaimah and, on Sheikh Hassan continuing to be 'obstinate', opened fire on four vessels anchored there. Firing from too long a range, the squadron expended some 350 rounds to no effect; it then disbanded, visiting other ports on the coast. Unsurprisingly, given this ineffective 'punishment', Lorimer reports \\"The temerity of the pirates increased\\" and further raids on shipping followed, including the taking of \\"an Arab vessel but officered by Englishmen and flying English colours\\" just 70 miles North of Bombay. After an additional year of recurring incidents, at the end of 1818 Hassan bin Rahmah made conciliatory overtures to Bombay that were \\"sternly rejected.\\" Naval resources commanded by the Al Qasimi during this period were estimated at around 60 large boats headquartered in Ras Al Khaimah, carrying from 80 to 300 men each, as well as 40 smaller vessels housed in other nearby ports. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The case against the Al Qasimi has been contested by the historian, author and Ruler of Sharjah, Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi in his book The Myth of Arab Piracy in the Gulf, in which he argues that the charges amount to a 'causus belli' by the East India Company, which sought to limit or eliminate the 'informal' Arab trade with India, and presents a number of internal communications between the Bombay Government and its officials, which shed doubt on many of the key charges made by Lorimer in his history of the affair. At the time, the Chief Secretary of the Government of Bombay, F. Warden, presented a minute which laid blame for the piracy on the Wahhabi influence on the Al Qasimi and the interference of British vessels in native affairs. Warden also successfully argued against a proposal to install the Sultan of Muscat as Ruler of the whole peninsula. Warden's arguments and proposals likely influenced the shape of the eventual treaty concluded with the Sheikhs of the Gulf coast.  Expeditionary force  In November 1819, the British embarked on an expedition against the Al Qasimi, led by Major-General William Keir Grant, voyaging to Ras Al Khaimah with a force of 3,000 soldiers. The British extended an offer to Said bin Sultan of Muscat in which he would be made ruler of the Pirate Coast if he agreed to assist the British in their expedition. Obligingly, he sent a force of 600 men and two ships.300x300px The naval force consisted of Liverpool, , , and a number of gun and mortar boats. Captain Collier, of Liverpool, 'led the naval force. The Bombay Marine of the East India Company (EIC) contributed six armed vessels: the 16-gun Teignmouth under the command of Captain Hall, the EIC senior captain, the 16-gun Benares, the 14-gun , the 14-gun , the 12-gun , and the 12-gun .The United service magazine, Vol. 141, pp.77-81. Later two frigates and 600 men belonging to the Sultan of Muscat joined the expedition. On the army side, Grant commanded some 3,000 troops in transports, including the 47th and 65th Regiments of Foot, the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Native Infantry, the flank companies of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Native Infantry and of the Marine Battalion, and half a company of Pioneers. In all, 1,645 European soldiers and marines and 1,424 Indian sepoys took part in the expedition. The force gathered off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah on 25 and 26 November and, on 2 and 3 December, troops were landed south of the town and set up batteries of guns and mortars and, on 5 December, the town was bombarded from both land and sea. Collier placed Captain Walpole of Curlew in charge of the gun boats and an armed pinnace to protect the landing, which was, however, unopposed.United service magazine Part 1, pp. 711‚Äì15. The bombardment of the town commenced on 6 December, from landed batteries of 12 pound guns and mortars as well as from sea. On 7 December, two 24-pound cannon from Liverpool were added to the land batteries. The rout of Ras Al Khaimah led to only five British casualties as opposed to the 400 to 1000 casualties reportedly suffered by the Al Qasimi.  The fall of Dhayah Fort  On the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, three cruisers were sent to blockade Rams to the North and this, too was found to be deserted and its inhabitants retired to the 'impregnable' hill-top fort of Dhayah.The hilltop fort of Dhayah, in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE.The British landed a force on 18 December, which fought its way inland through date plantations to Dhayah Fort on the 19th. There, 398 men and another 400 women and children held out, without sanitation, water or effective cover from the sun, for three days under heavy fire from mortars and 12-pound cannon. The two 24-pound cannon from HMS Liverpool which had been used to bombard Ras Al Khaimah from the landward side were once again pressed into use and dragged across the plain from the coastal mangrove swamps of Rams, a journey of some three miles. Each of the guns weighed over two tonnes. After enduring two hours of sustained fire from the big guns, which breached the fort's walls, the last of the Al Qasimi surrendered at 10.30 on the morning of 22 December. Many of the people in the fort were herders and farmers who had fled there on the arrival of the British and of the 398 people who surrendered, only 177 were identified as fighting men. The British flag was briefly flown from the fort before it was blown up. British losses from the action at Dhayah included one officer and three men killed and sixteen wounded. The British expeditionary force then blew up the town of Ras Al Khaimah and established a garrison there of 800 sepoys and artillery, before visiting Jazirat Al Hamra, which was found to be deserted. They went on to destroy the fortifications and larger vessels of Umm Al Qawain, Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hail, and Dubai. Ten vessels that had taken shelter in Bahrain were also destroyed. The Royal Navy suffered no casualties during the action.United service magazine Part 1, pp. 711‚Äì15.  General Maritime Treaty of 1820  With the Sheikhs of these communities either in captivity or choosing to give themselves up, a treaty was proposed in order to govern peaceful relationships in the future, the General Treaty of Maritime Peace of 1820. The treaty opens, 'In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate! Praise be to God, who hath ordained peace to be a blessing to his creatures.' Under the auspices of the UK's representative Sir William Keir Grant, the treaty prohibited piracy in the Persian Gulf, banned slavery and required all usable ships to be registered with British forces by flying distinctive red and white flags which exist today as the flags of the respective emirates. The treaty was signed by the Sheikhs of Khatt and Falaya; Jazirah Al Hamra; Abu Dhabi, Rams and Dhayah, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm Al Qawain. It was to lead to a permanent peace and an era of unprecedented prosperity, as well as establishing thriving coastal trading communities, some of which would grow to become global cities.

Plot  Trevor interferes with the humans; he drives Chidi away from the others by suggesting that Chidi's friendship with the subjects threatens clinical results, and he steers Jason and Tahani towards a meaningless hookup, all the while smothering the humans with overtures of friendship. Michael and Janet go to Earth, but struggle to hinder Trevor without their powers; Janet is perturbed by her inability to summon objects. Jason helps a drunk Tahani get home safely, but their friendship remains platonic. Eleanor is saddened by the loss of Chidi's friendship and mentorship, and she does not arrive for the next group meeting. Chidi, encouraged by Simone, affirms that he is Eleanor's friend, and she agrees to continue in the study. Judge Gen summons Michael, Janet, and Trevor back to the afterlife, and hurls a fawning Trevor into a void.

The church was designed by Edmund Blacket and the organ was designed by William Davidson, with some consultation from Montague Younger. The church and organ were built from 1889 to 1891. The church is also known as St. Paul's Anglican Church and Pipe Organ, St Paul's Anglican Church and Davidson Pipe Organ. The property is owned by Anglican Church Property Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Burwood= Parramatta Road was first created in 1791, a vital land (cf water) artery between Sydney Cove and Rose Hill's settlement and crops. Liverpool Road opened in 1814 as Governor Macquarie's Great South Road. Its winding route reflects pre-existing land grant boundaries. To Burwood's north over Parramatta Rd. was Longbottom Government Farm, staffed by convicts. This grew to over on heavily timbered flat, sloping to swamps on Hen & Chicken Bay. Commissioner Bigge recorded how valuable timber (ironbark) was cut and sawn on the spot, conveyed to Sydney in boats by the river. \\"Charcoal for the forges and foundries is likewise prepared here\\" he noted. Two grants were critical on Burwood's clay: Captain Thomas Rowley's Burwood Farm estate and William Faithful's grant to its south in Enfield covered most of modern Burwood. Rowley, adjutant of the NSW Corps, named it after the farm he'd lived on in Cornwall. 1799 and subsequent grants brought it to 750 acres but he continued to live at Kingston Farm in Newtown until his death in 1806. He'd bought some of the first Spanish merinos brought from the Cape Colony in 1797, others being sold to Macarthur, Marsden & Cox. The southern boundary of his farm was approximately Woodside Avenue & Fitzroy Street. Under Rowley's will the estate passed to his three underage children- executors Dr Harris & Major Johnstone were both involved in the 1808 Bligh rebellion and returned to England for the court martial. Governor Macquarie appointed Thomas Moore as guardian and executor. In 1812 he wrongfully auctioned the estate. It was bought by Sydney businessman Alexander Riley. He's believed to have built Burwood Villa in 1814 (perhaps on older (1797) foundations of Rowley's shepherd's cottage) and lived here until departing for England in 1817. In 1824 Joseph Lycett described the estate. had been cleared for pasture. Lycett in Views of Australia described \\"a garden of 4 acres in full cultivation, containing upwards of three hundred Trees, bearing the following choice fruits, viz. The Orange, Citron, Lemon, Pomegranate, Loquat, Guava, Peaches, Nectarines, Apricots, Apples, Pears, the Cherry, Plums, Figs, Chestnuts, Almonds, Medlars, Quinces; with abundance of Raspberries, Strawberries, and the finest Melons. &c;\\". Until the 1830s Burwood consisted of a few inns along the highways and 2 or 3 huge, undeveloped estates within the next 20 years these began to break up, attracting settlers and encouraging the growth of embryo villages at Burwood & Enfield. Riley died in 1833 and Rowley's children, now of age, started legal proceedings and regained possession of the estate. It was divided between Thomas jnr., John, John Lucas* and Henry Biggs. Almost at once they subdivided into lots of 4 for country homes and small farms. In 1834 Burwood estate was held by John Lucas, husband of Thomas's daughter Mary Rowley), who divided of his into small allotments for sale. Streets such as Webb, Lucas Road, Wentworth Road and Strathfield's The Boulevarde reflect the boundaries of these subdivisions/estates. To the south (including the land later the Appian Way) was William Faithful's grant of (1808) at \\"Liberty Plains\\". Faithful was a private in the NSW Corps: discharged in 1799 he became Captain Foveaux's farm manager, and this connection got him the grant. Apart from of Sarah Nelson's on Malvern Hill (Croydon), Faithful's Farm extended from Rowley's farm to Cooks River and west to Punchbowl Road. The government retained a right to build a road through it (doing so in 1815: Liverpool or the Great South Road), and to cut \\"such timber as may be deemed fit for naval purposes\\" - the area was thick with tall ironbark. Faithful exchanged it in 1815. Alexander Riley bought his north of the new road incorporating it into his Burwood estate. This was jointly owned by the Rowley family after 1833 and had no streets across it, only a few tracks. Despite opening up of the Rowley estate there was little settlement in Burwood between the two highways before 1860. Sydney Railway Company opened the first rail to Parramatta in 1855. Burwood \\"station\\" (just west of Ashfield station, one of the first stations) was a wooden platform near a level crossing over the grassy track that was Neich's Lane* (later Burwood Road). This was beside \\"the newly laid out township of Cheltenham\\". Speedy transport meant subdivision and consolidation followed, filling out the area. Burwood's biggest growth spurt was between 1874 & 1900 (Burwood's population was, respectively: 1200-7400, an increase not matched since. *1835 maps show this as the only track between Parramatta / Liverpool Roads in Burwood. Burwood's first public school was . In 1843 land on Burwood Road was granted to the Anglican Church for a school. St. Mary's Catholic Church opened in 1846, a Presbyterian Church in 1857 and St. Paul's Anglican in 1871. Mansions of the 1870s+ such as The Priory were due to a firm belief in its health-giving climate, compared to the smog and crowding of the city suburbs. They were built as quasi-ancestral estates, perhaps in blissful ignorance of how quickly suburbs can evolve. Living was primitive: no street lighting (1883+), home lighting by candle or lamp (oil, kerosene after 1860), no gas (1882+), no piped water (1886+), home wells/tanks, few bathrooms, no indoor toilets, with pans (1880+) replacing outdoor cess pits. The 1880s+ was the era of the debates that led to Australia's fractious states combining into a single Federation, declared at Sydney's Centennial Park, in 1901. Skilled tradesmen and materials were plentiful and comparatively cheap, and combined with the improvement in building techniques associated with cavity walls, damp-courses and terracotta tiled rooves, provided the means for an era of intense building activity. Unlike the Victorian era's large commercial and Government building, the main thrust of the Federation era was constructing new suburbs around Sydney harbour with shops for the middle classes. Between 1889 and 1918 Australia's population swelled from 3 to 5 million triggering an urgent need for housing. Suburban spread was greatly assisted by expansion of the public transport system of trams, ferries and trams, which formed a well-integrated pre-car transport system. Rapid suburban growth brought increased interest in town planning. Tree-lined streets such as Burwood Road, The Appian Way or The Boulevard in Strathfield were in marked contrast to most development in Australian cities of the late 19th century.Fraser, Hugh, in Heritage Council of NSW, 1981-4, amended and added to by Stuart Read, 17/5/2008 with excerpts from Eric Dunlop (1975). =Church history= Of the 20 or more churches whose parishes or spheres of influence include parts of Burwood six are situated outside its boundaries, and even this does not include St. John's Ashfield, whose parish once included all of Burwood and Croydon. Today the municipality is served by six other Anglican churches. The oldest, St. Thomas' (Enfield) was founded in 1848 and became a parish in its own right from 1868. The move to establish a parish church in central Burwood was sponsored by a group of gentlemen including the Rev. R. W. Young, incumbent of St. Thomas' Anglican church (Enfield). When St. Paul's was opened in Burwood Road (1872) Rev.Young left Enfield to become its first rector. At the time of its opening the church consisted solely of the nave with a temporary wooden wall where the transepts now cross it, but subsequent extensions - including the tower - have closely followed the design of ecclesiastical architect, Edmund Blacket. Several parishioners liberally supported the church in its early years, either by direct contributions or by advancing funds, Mr H. E. Krater of Enfield making an initial loan of A‚Ç§1000. The present vicarage was added in 1897, and with the addition of the choir in 1905 and the tower in 1924 under the supervision of architect E. Lindsay Thompson, the church was virtually completed as Blacket conceived it. During the period of rector Rev. Ronald O'Brien (1957-1970s) a peel of bells has been installed in the tower in 1960 and stone fencing completed along the Burwood Road frontage.Eric Dunlop, Harvest of the Years - the story of Burwood 1794-1974, Council of the Municipality of Burwood, 1974, Wentworth Press The Pipe Organ was commissioned during the incumbency of Canon Bartlett, a period of growth and establishment of pattern of liturgy at St Paul's. It was at first intended as a rebuild of an earlier organ; builder decided to build a new, larger instrument. Completed, with suggestions from St Andrew's Cathedral organist Montague Younger, and opened with a recital on 30 April 1891 by the aforementioned organist. Some teething problems by early 20th century, seen to by Richardson. It had long term use in the church's choral services, and frequent oratorio performances. The longest serving organist was Mr Tom Leah (+1970); another well known organist was Colin Sapsford, who became organist at Christ Church, St Laurence during the incumbency of Rev John Hope. During the incumbency of Rev John Holle (organist Peter McMillan) an attempt was made to substantially rebuild the instrument, which was halted by a Government Heritage Conservation Order. The Rector, in frustration locked and barred the instrument from use, buying an electronic Rodgers Organ. This precipitated the resignation of the organist and the defection of the choir to St Anne's Strathfield (late 1980s). Under the current Rector, Rev John Kohler and organist Luke Green, the organ has been returned to complete use in the church services and recital/concert-giving. Some minor preventative measures (tying up trumpet resonators, tuning) was carried out in early 1997. Unfortunate rebuilds of Davidson's larger St Thomas', North Sydney and St James', King Street, Sydney, make the Burwood organ the largest largely intact instrument of this builder and the largest of colonial NSW manufacture last century.  Description  St. Paul's Church is of State significance as a fine example of Edmund Blacket's ecclesiastical work and as a focal point of the Municipality. This Gothic Church (1871, completed 1924) situated high on Burwood Road and constructed of sandstone. Its features are include a slate roof, a tower, stone tracery and stained glass arched windows.LEP A pipe organ of three manual, and one pedal, divisions; Mechanical action to the manuals, tubular pneumatic to the pedals. The great organ's chorus is of 16' to the III-rank mixture; also two large flutes of 8' and 4' pitch; a trumpet reed, 8'. The swell organ's chorus is of 8' to a II-rank mixture; also a 16' bourdon, an 8' gedackt, viola and voix celeste; an horn reed, 8', an oboe reed, 8' and a clarion reed 4'. The church organ has an 8' gedackt, two 8' strings; an 8' flauto traverso, a 4' lieblich flute; and an 8' clarionet reed. The pedal organ has: open bass, bourdon (both 16') and 8' flute and violonce. Standard manual and pedal couplers (no octave or sub-bases); the swell and choir are under expression. See G. Rushworth \\"Historic Organs of NSW\\" Hale & Ironmonger P/L, 1988. Pp 104-106 = Condition = As at 11 April 2000, presently poor but usable. The pipework and action, layout and decorative features are substantially the same (including the position) as when first installed. = Modifications and dates = *1905 - The moving of the organ's console and great organ windchest 305mm out into the chancel (little or no intrusion on the instrument's integrity). *Some additions to the stop list, 1905, 1915, 1930, before 1930 (little intrusion). *Badly fitted balance pedals for swell and choir expression (some intrusion especially poorly designed tremulant on swell's old trigger pedal)  Heritage listing  St Paul's Anglican Church and Pipe Organ was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cultural artifact of the late 19th century colonial NSW; growing economic stability, and affluence in the garden suburb of Burwood, resulted in a public musical instrument of considerable size and power, yet taste and restraint as most fitting of the strongly conservative political alignment of the area; speaking of confidence and cultural attention. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. A very virile, powerful, yet always tastefully restrained tone emanates from this instrument, capable of some subtlety and sweetness in tone for accompaniment etc. Strikingly fluid, curved display fronts into the chancel; handsome blue-green, dark red and gold stenciling on the pipes in an excellent state of preservation. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The organ is used up to three times (2 Holy Communions, Evensong) every Sunday; up to three times a week in weddings, funerals, additional services and concerts. Provides congregational singing accompaniment in chamber and small orchestral settings, Civic services and dedicatory services also. When in better condition, the organ could serve as an excellent teaching instrument (especially with many schools in the area). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Beside G Rushworth's outstanding research, the construction techniques an material sources etc of colonial organ builders has not been so thoroughly documented, especially their resourcefulness in periods of economic Depression, lack of code of fair practice in working relations and contractual agreements, etc. The Burwood organ could easily be an opportunity to carefully document this, especially given its excellent condition or could be lost in yet another restoration of a more invasive character. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Largest organ in (near) intact state surviving by a NSW colonial builder. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. A fine representative of local building (as opposed to imported instruments from Britain) of the late 19th century.

Early life Nomkhitha Virginia Mashinini was born on May 9, 1935, in Bengu, South Africa, a settlement near Lady Frere in the former Transkei. Her father, Daniel Boto, was of royal descent and an Imbongi for the royal court. He had fifteen children from his first marriage. After the death of his first wife, Boto married Olive Nontuthuzelo from the village of St Marks. Nomkhitha was their first child. Nomkhitha's brother Mark was born a few years later. The two siblings shared a very close bond. Their mother was often away during the weekdays since she worked as a teacher in a village beyond the average commuting distance. Their father was more involved in their upbringing, something which was unusual for most African families at the time. As a royal praise singer, Boto valued traditional Xhosa customs and instilled those values in Nomkhitha. Many would later trace the rhetorical skills of her son Tsietsi to Boto. Nomkhitha also had a Christian background, owing to her mother's Christian faith. She attended church in Lady Frere every Sunday.Lynda Schuster. A Burning Hunger: One Family‚Äôs Struggle Against Apartheid Ohio University Press, 15 Sep 2014 page 10-30 Education At the age of 13, Nomkhitha was sent to a boarding school for black girls in Mt. Author near Lady Frere, where she studied Biology, Geography, History, English and Arithmetic. https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/nomkhitha-virginia- mashinini Accessed 25 September 2018 Nomkhitha also played tennis, and was generally a very sociable child. She would return home during the Summer & Winter holidays. And her family would visit on their monthly trips to Lady Frere. Back then, there were only two professions open to black women: teaching and nursing. Nomkhitha decided to study nursing, intending to return to Bengu to practice there. After completing high school at the age of 17, Nomkhitha moved to Kliptown near Soweto to attend the nursing college in Baragwanath Hospital (now Chris Hani Hospital). While in Kliptown, she stayed with her Aunt Letitia in a two room rental. Her aunt was unwilling to lose Nomkhitha as a help in the house, so she falsely led her to believe that her applications to various nursing schools were rejected. Years later Nomkhitha would learn that some of the schools had actually accepted her.Lynda Schuster. A Burning Hunger: One Family‚Äôs Struggle Against Apartheid Ohio University Press, 15 Sep 2014 page 10-30 Marriage Nomkhitha met Ramothibi Joseph Mashinini in Kliptown, and they got married in 1955. Ramothibi was a devout Christian man who came from a poor Sotho family in the Free State (province). The wedding took place over two days, with both a Christianceremony in a Presbyterian church in Johannesburg, as well as a traditional wedding where they slaughtered a goat and performed a ceremony more in line with the historical culture of the area. According to tradition, Nomkhitha stopped speaking isiXhosa out of respect for her mother-in-law, unfortunately she was not fluent in Sotho. A few months after the wedding, she gave birth to her first son, Mokete. Nomkhitha returned to live with Letitia a week prior to the birth, and remained there till a month after Mokete's birth. As was tradition in both Sotho and Xhosa customs. Over the course of their marriage, they had 13 children: 11 boys & 2 twin girls. Nomkitha did not plan to have a large family but, like many women of the time, Nomkhitha felt powerless in preventing pregnancy as contraceptives were expensive.Lynda Schuster. A Burning Hunger: One Family‚Äôs Struggle Against Apartheid Ohio University Press, 15 Sep 2014 page 10-30 Soweto Uprising In 1976, her son Tsietsi Mashinini and daughter Mpho Mashinini led the student uprising against Bantu education in Soweto. As a result of the riots that occurred, four of her sons had to flee from the country. One of whom returned and was tried for conspiring to sabotage the government via a military coup. Due to increased police surveillance, Nomkhitha travelled to Swaziland in an effort to protect her younger children. Upon her return from Swaziland, she was detained by the South African Police in Standerton on July 1, 1977. Two of her younger sons and Mpho Mashinini were detained on the same day. One of the detained sons, Sydney Mashishi, who was 14 at the time, was tortured and beaten by the police due to his siblings' involvement in the protests. While in police custody, she was kept under solitary confinement. She was frequently interrogated regarding the whereabouts and political activities of her children.

After reading the citation, Committee Chair Berit Reiss- Andersen told reporters that the impact of this year's award is to highlight sexual abuse with the goal that every level of governance take responsibility to end such crimes and impunities. The citation also highlighted the historic context of the 2018 award: \\"This year marks a decade since the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1820 (2008), which determined that the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict constitutes both a war crime and a threat to international peace and security. This is also set out in the Rome Statute of 1998, which governs the work of the International Criminal Court. The Statute establishes that sexual violence in war and armed conflict is a grave violation of international law. A more peaceful world can only be achieved if women and their fundamental rights and security are recognised and protected in war.\\" Mukwege is the first Congolese and Murad the seventeenth woman and first Iraqi to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Each delivered a Nobel lecture on December 10 at Oslo City Hall as part of the Nobel Peace Prize Award ceremony, which took place among main events scheduled during the December 9‚Äì11 \\"Nobel days in Oslo.\\"  Award announcement  Denis Mukwege is a gynecologist specializing in the treatment of women victimized by sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Nadia Murad is a Yazidi human rights advocate who survived sexual slavery by the Islamic State in Iraq and published a memoir of the ordeal. \\"Each of them in their own way has helped to give greater visibility to war-time sexual violence, so that the perpetrators can be held accountable for their actions,\\" reads the award citation. Norwegian Nobel Committee Chair Berit Reiss-Andersen commented on whether the Me Too movement inspired the Committee's award decision: \\"Metoo and war crimes are not quite the same. But they have in common that they see the suffering of women, the abuse of women and that it is important that women leave the concept of shame behind and speak up.\\" At the time of the announcement in Oslo, neither awardee could be reached and informed of winning the prize. \\"I was in the operating room so when they started to make noise around (it) I wasn't really thinking about what was going on and suddenly some people came in and told me the news,\\" Mukwege told Norwegian daily VG after completing his second surgery of the day, \\"It was so touching when I was operating and I heard people start to cry and it was so, so, so touching.\\" \\"I can see in the faces of many women how they are happy to be recognised, and this is really so touching,\\" he said when informed by phone of the news. Later addressing colleagues and supporters at the hospital, he said: \\"dear survivors around the world, I want to tell you that through this prize the world is listening to you and refuses indifference ... We hope that the world will no longer delay taking action in your favour, with force and determination, because the survival of humanity depends on you. It's you women who carry humanity.\\" \\"I hope that it will help bring justice for those women who suffered from sexual violence,\\" said Murad, learning of the award while in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She said she will share her award \\"with Yazidis, Iraqis, Kurds, other persecuted minorities and all of the countless victims of sexual violence around the world\\" and will be thinking of her mother, who was slain by IS militants. Middlebury College President Laurie L. Patton wrote in an email, \\"This is by far the best cancellation notice I have ever had to write,\\" when Murad had to cancel as guest speaker delivering the night of the award announcement a presentation entitled \\"Hope Has an Expiration Date: Exploring the Plight of Victims of Ethnic and Religious Violence in the Middle East.\\"  Reactions  Tweeted reactions began pouring in immediately following the announcement, with Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth calling it a \\"long awaited Nobel recognition\\", Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland calling it \\"the best Nobel Prize in a long time\\", and the government of Iraq expressing \\"deepest respect\\" for Murad. The only Yazidi in Iraq's Parliament, Vian Dakhil wrote in a statement that Murad \\"proved to the whole world that the will of life and peace is above the savagery of terrorism and hard-liner ideas,\\" and Iraqi President Barham Salih tweeted that \\"Nadia's honor reflects the world's recognition of the Yazidis tragedy, and all victims of terrorism in Iraq.\\" \\"We hope that this recognition will help Nadia and Yazidis endeavours to bring justice, peace, and coexistence\\", tweeted the non-governmental organization Yazda. Hussam Abdullah of the Yazidi Organization for Documentation said \\"this win represents the international recognition of the genocide that was committed by Daesh,\\" referring to the Sinjar massacre in August 2014. Among various remarks from the United Nations, UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres said: \\"By honouring these defenders of human dignity, this prize also recognizes countless victims around the world who have too often been stigmatized, hidden and forgotten. This is their award, too... Let us honour these new Nobel laureates by standing up for victims of sexual violence everywhere.\\" And UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said: \\"Nadia and Denis, I'm sure I speak for all human rights defenders, when I say we salute you, we admire you beyond words. You have fought for the pain women have suffered through sexual abuse to be recognized and confronted, and for their dignity to be restored. We need more people to stand up the way you have stood up for the rights of women, for justice, for the rights of minorities, for the rights of everyone.\\" Other world leaders applauding the two laureates included DR Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende, President of the European Council Donald Tusk, European Commission spokesperson Natasha Bertaud, Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg, and Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert.  Laureates' work  Since 1999, at the onset of the Kivu conflict, Mukwege and Panzi Hospital which he founded in Bukavu have treated some 50,000 women sexually victimized and their children born of sexual violence. Journalist Nicholas Kristoff recounts Dr. Mukwege's efforts in eastern Congo, since interviewing him in 2010, at repairing mass rape victims' horrific internal injuries and speaking out on their behalf at risk of his and his family's life, and Murad's efforts since her abduction and enslavement in 2014 at speaking publicly about the plight of the Yazidis especially women and girls forced into sexual slavery. Award ceremony Since 1990, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded every year on 10 December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, by the Norwegian Nobel Committee chair in a ceremony at Oslo City Hall that includes the laureate's Nobel lecture in the presence of the King of Norway and royal family. The laureate receives a Nobel diploma, medal and document confirming the Nobel Prize amount. In the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize award presentation speech, committee chair Berit Reiss-Andersen reiterated the committee's decision to award Mukwege and Murad for their respective efforts to address the war crimes of sexual violence, commending them to the \\"long tradition of champions of human dignity\\" also celebrated on this date, the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In her Nobel lecture, Nadia Murad described the plight of the Yazidi community from her own experience and yet her \\"hope that today marks the beginning of a new era ... to define a new roadmap to protect women, children and minorities from persecution, in particular victims of sexual violence,\\" calling on the international community to \\"unite to fight injustice and oppression\\" and \\"raise our voices together\\" to say \\"no to violence, yes to peace, no to slavery, yes to freedom, no to racial discrimination, yes to equality and to human rights for all.\\" In his Nobel lecture, Dennis Mukwege recounted unspeakably horrific suffering of especially babies, girls and women he has treated at Panzi Hospital for mass rape and mutilation since the First Congo War, suffering \\"that shames our common humanity.\\" With hundreds of thousands raped, 4 million internally displaced and 6 million killed, he said, \\"only the fight against impunity can break the spiral of violence.\\" =Torchlight parade= The traditional torchlight parade in honour of the Nobel laureates on 10 December 2018 was organised by the Norwegian Peace Council in cooperation with five NGOs who work in the field of women's rights and humanitarian relief, the Norwegian Women's Lobby, the Forum for Women and Development, Norwegian Church Aid, Plan International Norway and JOIN Good Forces.

He was a Badry martyr who sacrificed his life in the Battle of Badr Al Kubra also known as Ghazwat Badr or The Battle of Badr. Early life His father Abd Amro left his tribe to settle in Makkah. In Makkah he developed good relations with the tribe of Abd Al Harith bin Zahra as a result of which Abd al Harith gave his daughter Ni'ma in marriage to Abd Amro. As a result of this union Umair Zish Shamaleyn was born in 594 AD.Family Tree and Lineage of Umair, Kunniyah Abu Muhammad, title Zi Shamaleyn. He was named Umair, Kunniyah Abu Muhammad, title Zi Shamaleyn. His lineage was Umair the son of Abd Amro the son Nazla the son of Amro the son of Ghabshan the son of Salim the son of Malik the son of Isa the son of Harisa Amro the son of Amir Al Khaza‚Äôi Conversion and Hijrat Little is known about his conversion to Islam, but he accepted Islam before the Hijra. After his conversion he migrated to Madinah (known as Hijra) and became a guest of Sa‚Äôad bin Khuseymah. Muhammad made him a Mawakhat brother of Yazeed bin Harith. Bin Harith gave his daughter in marriage to Umair from whom he had a son and a daughter named Umair and Rayta respectively, hence title Ze Shamaleyn. Hadith  Sunan Nasai, Book of Sahu, Hadith no. 1229 and 1231.Sunan an-Nasa'i Book 13 Hadith 1231 Quranic Ayat  Muhammad gave his sermons irrespective of cast, creed or wealth. The chieftains and rich among the Meccans, namely both sons of Rabia i.e. Atabah and Sheba, Mata‚Äôam the son Adi, Harith son of Nofil, Qarta son of Umro and the Chieftains of Abd Manaf all gathered and went to Abu Talib requesting Shamalain to ask Muhammad to distance himself from common poor folk and the miserable, as only then would they visit his gatherings. They told Abu Talib that if Muhammad were to do so they would have great respect for him, visit his sermons and maybe understand his teachings. Abu Talib took their message to Muhammad. Umar Al Khattab commented that nothing was wrong with their demand and that Muhammad should accept this. This incident inspired Ayat 6:53. The poorest companions that the racist and rich chieftains wanted to discard in addition to Amro Zish Shamalain were Bilal, Ammar, Salim Sabih, Masood and Ibn Masood, Miqdad, Waqid and Yazeed.Quran 6:53 Martyrdom Cemetery of martyrs of The Battle of Badr Al Kubra at the wells of Badr. After Shamalain came to Madina he participated in the Battle of Badr Al Kubra. This was his first and last Ghazwa.Asad al-Ghabah: 2/141 In this battle he sacrificed his life for Islam and became a Badry martyr, a holiness shared by only fourteen others. It is said that his Yazid bin Harith didn't leave him even in death and both were martyred together in the battle.

Traffickers recruit vulnerable children, including children in pupil referral units who have been excluded from school, as drug dealers. Some young people are recruited via \\"debt bondage\\", whereby they enter county lines to pay off drug debts. Others take part of their own volition, owing to boredom and a lack of legitimate opportunity in marginalized communities. The term \\"county lines\\" refers to the phone numbers, or lines, dedicated to this activity. The practice is also known by those involved as \\"going country\\" or \\"going OT\\" (\\"outta town\\").  Scale  Between the years of 2018 to 2019, National Crime Agency figures showed there were 1,500 drug trafficking routes of this sort in the United Kingdom, rising to 3,000; in that year the agency estimated the total turnover of county lines activities throughout the UK to be roughly ¬£500 million. A 2020 report for the Home Office by Professor Dame Carol Black states that the county lines drug trade involved 27,000 young people in the UK.  Causes  In 2019, Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, blamed cuts in police numbers for the rise of county lines gangs. Also in 2019, police said that they lacked the resources to tackle County Lines. They mentioned cuts to youth services may have been a contributing factor. They mentioned it was difficult to get the funding. County Lines operation unit run by the National County Lines Co-ordination Centre. Jointly run by the National Crime Agency and National Police Chief's Council, it opened in September of 2019. It is thought that it has helped to find suspects and help victims of drug trafficking. https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/05/police-lack-resources-tackle- county-lines-drugs-networks A 2020 report for the Home Office by Professor Dame Carol M. Black traces the causes of the phenomenon to a combination of government cuts in youth services and drug recovery services, absence of parents, poor parenting, increased child poverty, school exclusions, and availability of purer forms of drugs.  Response  In 2018, a drug dealer was convicted of offences under the Modern Slavery Act relating to \\"county lines\\" activities. In 2018 The Children's Society, a British charity, criticised what it said was an inconsistent approach by professionals working with children, being concerned that, while some police and social workers viewed the practice as child exploitation, others treated vulnerable young people solely as criminals. In the same year Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, set up a \\"rescue and response\\" programme, which in its first year referred 568 young people to support channels. In 2019 he said that more than 4,000 children and young people had been found to have links with county lines activities. In October 2019, a nationwide police crackdown led to the arrests of 700 people alleged to be connected to county lines trafficking. In November 2019, Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks that they would be featuring an issue-led storyline inspired by the county lines trafficking. The long-running storyline sees teenagers Juliet Nightingale (Niamh Blackshaw) and Sid Sumner (Billy Price) be manipulated by Jordan Price (Connor Calland) and Victor Brothers (Benjamin O'Mahoney) into selling drugs to children in and nearby to their village.

The 289th overall episode of the series, it aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 3, 2018. The episode references the Catholic Church sexual abuse cases, which were previously addressed in \\"Red Hot Catholic Love\\". Plot As the families of South Park gather at church on Sunday, Stan Marsh questions why he has to go to church every week. His parents, Randy and Sharon, admonish him on the ritual's importance, and say that they always feel better after each service. At church, Father Maxi struggles to deliver his sermon amid all the constant interruptions by members of the congregation who make jokes referencing Catholic Church sexual abuse cases. Butters Stotch attempts to console Maxi, relating to him how he had been the subject of ridicule at school, but now enjoys greater popularity. Encouraging him not to give his tormentors the satisfaction of cowering in shame, he invites Maxi to board game night with his friends at Stan's house, but Maxi's appearance there garners more ridicule from Randy, who finds the scene of a Catholic priest sitting with five boys worthy of a photograph on social media. When an embarrassed Maxi leaves, Butters goes after him. Saying that he himself was once like Father Maxi, Butters implores him not to allow himself to be daunted by the cruelty of others, and to simply be himself. As a result of this, Maxi spends more time socializing with Butters, to the point that churchgoers find the church doors locked the following Sunday. When Mr. Mackey alerts the Denver Archdiocese that \\"another\\" priest has disappeared from his parish, the diocese sends a cleanup crew of ordained church officials to thoroughly clean the South Park church, Stan's house, and any other location where Father Maxi has been, in order to remove trace evidence of child molestation, in particular semen. At Clyde Donovan's birthday party at a roller rink, Butters brings Maxi, much to the anger of Clyde, who does not want a priest at his party. A demoralized Maxi leaves with Butters, and later confesses to him that some time ago, he learned the extent of the Catholic Church sex abuse problem, and that it was worse than anyone thought (as seen in the episode \\"Red Hot Catholic Love\\"). When the cleanup crew appear at the roller rink and learn that Maxi was there with Butters, they kidnap Stan and Clyde, and after tracking Butters down, they kidnap him as well. The cleanup crew take the three boys into the woods, where they have deployed a Zamboni ice resurfacer modified to clean up semen, or \\"Kumboni\\". Father Maxi tracks down and confronts the cleanup crew, telling them to do whatever they want to him, but to spare the children. Surprised, the bishop in charge says that they are not there to kill him, but to cover up his crimes and issue him a transfer to the Maldives, just as the Church has always done with priests accused of child molestation. When they assure him that other priests will take over for him in South Park, Father Maxi uses the Kumboni to trample the cleanup crew to death. He returns to his position at South Park's church, delivering his sermons and calmly enduring the continued jokes at the expense of the Church. Reception Jesse Schedeen with IGN rated the episode an 8.2 out of 10, summarizing in his review \\"This week's South Park offered a better sense of how the new season will set itself apart. The idea of looking back a decade or more to revisit classic South Park episodes is definitely appealing, and hopefully this won't be the last time we see that approach in Season 22.\\" John Hugar with The A.V. Club rated the episode a B+ and ended his review stating, \\"This episode isn't an all-time classic like 'Red Hot Catholic Love,' but much like last week's episode, it handled a dark, difficult topic with the appropriate mix of irreverence and empathy. Trey and Matt are clearly embracing their role as social commentators, and so far, the results have been thoroughly rewarding.\\" The episode was denounced by The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. However, the criticism was not for casting the Catholic Church in a negative light, but for portraying the Catholic priests accused of misconduct as molesting younger children instead of adolescents.

It stars Dylan McDermott, Charlie Plummer, Samantha Mathis, and Madisen Beaty. The film is set in Kentucky and was also shot there. It premiered at LA Film Festival on September 22, 2018, and received a limited theatrical release on November 16, 2018, distributed by IFC Midnight.  Synopsis  Sixteen-year-old Tyler Burnside lives with his devout Christian family in the small remote town of Clarksville, Kentucky. The town and its residents are haunted by the memory of the Clovehitch Killer, an infamous serial killer who bound and strangled ten known female victims before apparently disappearing 10 years earlier. Tyler takes his father's truck one night to see a girl, who finds a bondage photograph between the seats. When word of the photo spreads among the other teenagers in Tyler's church group and scout troop, they ostracize him, believing him to be a BDSM fetishist. Tyler, meanwhile, begins to wonder if his father, family man and community leader Don Burnside, could have something to do with the Clovehitch Killer. Tyler investigates Don's private shed and finds a hidden compartment containing bondage magazines, along with a Polaroid photograph of a beaten and bound woman. Fearing that his father might be the killer, Tyler befriends a teen outcast and amateur Clovehitch historian named Kassi and asks for her help. Kassi is initially skeptical, but they link the photograph to a known Clovehitch victim, find blueprints to a BDSM dungeon in the shed, and when Tyler explores his house's crawl space, he finds a box containing the drivers licenses of the known Clovehitch victims and other women as well as more polaroid photographs of beaten and bound women. Don, suspicious of Tyler's behavior, takes him camping. To explain the evidence Tyler has uncovered, Don claims that the Clovehitch Killer was Tyler's vegetative uncle Rudy, who became paralyzed after the guilt drove him to a suicide attempt. Don says he kept the evidence in hopes of one day giving it to the victims' families. Tyler accepts the explanation, and the two burn all the evidence. Tyler ends the investigation, although Kassi remains unsatisfied with Don's story. Don surprisingly allows Tyler to attend a scout leadership camp, something he had previously claimed the family had no money for. He then sends Tyler's mother Cindy and sister Susie to visit Cindy's mother for two weeks. Home alone, he photographs himself dressed as a woman in bondage positions, but angrily throws the photos away later. Afterwards, he stalks a woman through town. After casing her house, he breaks in, binds her, and begins strangling her. However, Tyler appears in the house with a rifle, and it is revealed in flashback that Tyler never left for camp, but was secretly watching Don with Kassi. The flashback also reveals that Kassi's mother, who went missing ten years prior, was an unknown Clovehitch victim. Don incapacitates Kassi and convinces Tyler to surrender his rifle; he immediately tries to shoot Tyler with it, only to find the chamber empty. The two scuffle, and Don nearly strangles Tyler until Kassi awakens and knocks Don unconscious. Kassi begins to dial 9-1-1, but Tyler grabs her hand and stops her. Later, Don has been declared missing, but Tyler's family remains stable. They are informed that the police have discovered Don's body and his death is considered a suicide. At their church, Tyler delivers a eulogy for Don, intercut with scenes of him and Kassi dragging Don, unconscious, into the forest. The forest scene ends with Don slowly waking up and Tyler pointing a pistol at his head. Tyler ends the eulogy with, \\"Dad, if you can hear me, I love you.\\"  Cast   Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Clovehitch Killer holds an approval rating of 78%, based on 32 reviews, and an average rating of 6.96/10. Its consensus reads, \\"The Clovehitch Killer patiently dials up the tension with a story that makes up for a lack of surprises with strong performances and a chilling wit.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Joseph Hernandez of the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival said that \\"this small town thriller has a sinister edge and sports an exciting narrative device that flips the story on its head.\\" Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter called the plot \\"slow ... more reliant on atmosphere than action to build suspense ... offers an intriguing perspective on the dark side of Americans values ... but lacks the conviction to entirely expose the cultural contradictions that often enable compulsive murderers ... It's a missed opportunity.\\" In a 2019 list of the 50 best serial killer movies of all time, Paste magazine ranked The Clovehitch Killer #48, writing \\"This is a devilish movie that does beautifully what horror films are meant to‚Äîvex us with fear‚Äîthrough the most deceptively simple of means.\\"  References   External links   * Category:2018 thriller films Category:2018 horror films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:American thriller films Category:American serial killer films Category:Films set in Kentucky Category:Films shot in Kentucky ","title":"The Clovehitch Killer"},{"id":"58622517","text":"Angelo Spinillo (born 1 May 1951, Sant'Arsenio) is an Italian bishop.

The triple-girder underbridge spans Burwood Road. The railway bridge was built from 1892 to 1926 by John Ahern. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History   Description  The Burwood rail underbridge is a single-span metal, half-through plate web girder. It carries the double Main Suburban line (middle two of the six tracks) on a three-girder arrangement - outer girder, down suburban, inner girder, up suburban, outer girder. The term \\"metal\\" has been used to draw attention to the fact that the outer girders were part of an 1892 wrought iron bridge whereas the 1926 inner girder is steel. The cross girders carry a concrete deck supporting ballasted tracks. On the north side of the Up outer girder is the makers plate - John Ahern 1892 Govt Contract.Rail Infrastructure s170 Register = Condition = As at 27 March 2006, the physical condition is good.  Heritage listing  As at 27 March 2006, The Burwood rail underbridge is an example of triple-girder bridge. Constructed as a plate web girder bridge, it is a major example of a main line bridge. Burwood rail underbridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Maker's Plate on the triple-girder plate web girder bridge over Burwood Road is historically rare. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Triple-girder bridges are relatively rare, there being two others on this rail corridor (located at Burren Street, Macdonaldtown and Old Canterbury Road, Lewisham) and another just past Strathfield over Powells Creek. The oldest triple-girder plate web girder bridge is the 1879 wrought iron structure over Ultimo Road, originally built for the double-track goods line to Darling Harbour now giving single-track access to the Powerhouse Museum. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Plate web girders are a common, basic railway bridge usually with only two parallel girders, be they single or double track bridges. The Burwood rail underbridge represents the triple- girder type.

Inscription built into the Burwood sewer vent, Corner Railway Parade and Wentworth Road, Burwood The Burwood Sewer Vent is a heritage-listed sewer ventilation stack located at Railway Parade in the Sydney suburb of Burwood in the Municipality of Burwood local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was designed and built by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage in 1919. It is also known as Wentworth Road Sewer Vent and Railway Parade Sewer Vent. The property is owned by Sydney Water, a statutory corporation of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  The Main Western Carrier which fed into Botany sewer farm was completed in 1897 and encompasses the major crossing of Wolli Creek and Cooks River each by triple barrel 1800 mm dia. wrought iron/steel aqueducts. There are triple barrel brick arch aqueducts at the ends. Soon after construction more sewage was being collected from this newer Western arm than there was from the original Southern Division arm. This is even with allowing for dramatic increase in flow within the first few years of the Southern Division. The Western Branch Main Sewer which feeds into the Main Western Carrier was completed in stages all the way through to Strathfield. Work was completed on this sewer in 1904. The section also contains the Croydon (1922) and Burwood (Strathfield) (1919) concrete vent stacks which were built because of damage caused by gases from the then new Homebush Abattoir after it opened in 1916. In 1888 before the Botany Scheme was even commissioned, Burwood Council had requested a sewage treatment plant for Hen & Chicken Bay on the Parramatta River. They were told by the NSW Government to wait for the Western Suburbs Sewer and the Western Branch Main Sewer is the result of that undertaking. Had the Burwood scheme proceeded, the Western Branch Main Sewer may not have been built in the location it was eventually constructed.  Description  A reinforced concrete vent shaft built in 1919, very similar in design to that at Paisley Road, Croydon. It comprises an octagonal pedestal, at its highest point approximately 5.5m above ground level to the base of a circular shaft in plan with radiating concrete ribs and 2 octagonal concrete bands up the length of the shaft. The capital of the shaft like Paisley Road has neo classical console brackets below a projecting cornice. The entrance door is located on the south east corner with the steel door being original, set into a reinforced concrete projecting frame, whereas Paisley Road is recessed. There is evidence of past patch repair work around numerous areas of the shaft and pedestal, and presently there is evidence of spalling and reinforcement corrosion on the southern wall of the pedestal particularly. The area surrounding the vent shaft is dominated by late 20th century flats and to the north is the Railway line across Railway Parade. The immediate ground surrounding the shaft is cleared which forms part of a small reserve at the corner of Wentworth Road and Railway Parade. A manhole is located some 15 metres to the east adjacent the footpath to Railway Parade. A lightning conductor is located on the south east side of the shaft and the south face of the pedestal. Iron eyelets are fixed to the circular section of the shaft possibly for a former lightning conductor. The concrete vent stack is prominent some 500 metres north on Wentworth Road and is a landmark set on an open reserve fronting Railway Parade. The siting of the vent shaft is presently somewhat isolated as part of the reserve fronting Railway Parade and opposite the Railway line at a considerable road intersection. The concrete vent shaft in itself is considerably intact and in fair condition although in need of some maintenance to doors and concrete. Considerably intact. = Further information = Undertake a conservation plan for the item should the property be proposed for sale.  Heritage listing  As at 4 May 2005, the vent shaft is a locally prominent landmark, and one of only two like structures in Sydney Water's system, which plays an important function to the main western sewer system. The unusual design and reinforced concrete construction is rare for this type of vent in a State context. Burwood Sewer Vent was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The vent has tangible historical associations with the western branch main sewer and through the influence of sewer gases generated from the Homebush abattoir, an element which has now been removed forever. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The vent holds a prominent position on the corner of Wentworth Road and Railway Parade, and is a substantial local landmark. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is likely the vent stack holds some value to the local community in its function and landmark value. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The vent plays an important function in the servicing of the western branch main sewer. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Regarding its design and construction it is rare on a State level and one of only two in the Sydney Water system. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. In terms of vent function alone, it is representative of the function it has played in the operation of sewer systems.

History  It is considered one of the most notable 16th century atlases of the Dieppe school of Cartography. It is believed that Nicholas Vallard was the first owner and this is why the publication bears his name The atlas is held at the Huntington Library based in San Marino, California, US.  Description  The atlas is made of 68 pages and contains 15 nautical charts with rich illustrations as well as a calendar and some in-depth maritime information. The atlas contains numerous illuminations that show the new world inhabitants and this is why it is considered a valuable testimony of discovery. The original publication is bound in crimson leather with golden decorations. The maps depicted in the atlas are inverted compared to modern depictions, as the north pole is placed on the bottom side of the atlas while the south pole is placed on the top. There is some speculation that like some other works of the Dieppe school of maps, the atlas shows the Australian coastline, a continent entitled Jave la Grande, which would mean it was painted before the documented arrival of Willem Janszoon or James Cook.K.G.

The episode was written by Rick Dunkle and directed by Larry Teng. At the time of its initial release, the episode was watched by 12.92 million viewers and received mixed reviews but television critics praised A.J. Cook's performance. Plot After being abducted at the end of the previous episode, JJ (A. J. Cook) wakes with a bag over her head and a gag in her mouth. When her captors remove the bag, she sees a face she recognizes. She fights her restraints as he drugs her. In a flashback to the U.S. Operations Camp in Afghanistan in 2010, JJ meets with Section Chief Erin Strauss (Jayne Atkinson). JJ has been assigned to a task force that is looking for Osama bin Laden, and will interrogate female suspects without the brutality used on male suspects. JJ meets Mateo Cruz (Esai Morales); Michael Hastings (Tahmoh Penikett); and Tivon Askari (Faran Tahir), her interpreter. In the present day, the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) learns of her disappearance and that she previously worked with their new Section Chief, Cruz, who is also missing. Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) uses her hacking skills to find out why JJ and Cruz might have been taken, while Rossi (Joe Mantegna) and Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn) search through JJ's old office and find documents about her secret mission, code-named \\"Integrity\\". Garcia and Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) talk to Agent Anderson (Brian Appel), and Hotch (Thomas Gibson) goes to the Department of State to see Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs Rosemary Jackson (Debrah Farentino), the creator of JJ‚Äôs taskforce. Under Secretary Jackson reveals translator Tivon Askari as the perpetrator, but, in order to avoid another government scandal, bans the BAU from the investigation. Despite the ban, Hotch calls in reinforcements: Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster), former BAU agent, now head of Interpol. The BAU classifies Askari as a serial killer and identifies his pattern. As JJ and Cruz are tortured for the security codes to ‚ÄúIntegrity‚Äù, JJ realizes that Askari is working with someone else. Although the team initially suspects Cruz, Hastings is the real mole. He staged his death by setting off a roadside bomb, which resulted in JJ miscarrying her would-be second child. While the team is out looking for JJ and Cruz, \\"Blackbird\\" appears on Garcia‚Äôs computer screen and Prentiss tells them that it is JJ. Garcia and Kevin are apprehended for hacking into the system, but are able to relay the information about JJ's location. Prentiss joins the team to help rescue JJ, who has been tortured through such forms as waterboarding, electrocution, and attempted rape. Prentiss and Hotch find JJ just in time to prevent Askari from killing her. She and Prentiss go after Hastings. The fight culminates in Hastings‚Äô death as he falls off the roof. The team reunites with JJ while Cruz is sent to the hospital. The team and Prentiss celebrate at a bar and say farewell to Prentiss before she heads back to London. Production On September 30, 2013, it was announced that former cast member Paget Brewster would return for the 200th episode and reprise her role as Emily Prentiss. On January 21, 2014, it was announced that Battlestar Galactica star Tahmoh Penikett had been cast in a key role as Michael Hastings. Speaking about the 200th episode, A.J. Cook revealed that the episode will delve in to JJ's time away from the BAU during Season 6 > \\"We're going to use the serendipitous gift of Season 6 to explain with > flashbacks what happened when she was working for the Pentagon and why she > came back as a much tougher character. I've never had a chance to flex my > acting muscles like this on the show!\\". Cook also revealed that she performed most of her own stunts during the episode - some of which Cook says she actually experienced so the show would look authentic. One of the stunts was being waterboarded. This is the first time since the pilot episode that the opening credits were not shown as more time was needed for the episode footage, so the credits were cut, and the stars names were listed during the first scene following the teaser.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History Flint at the beginning of the twentieth century was experiencing explosive growth tied to the growth of the automotive industry. The city's population nearly tripled from 1900 to 1910, and continued increasing into the 1930s. This increase in population severely crimped the housing supply in the area, and the housing market boomed as a result. In 1909, Nelson C. and Helen Webster purchased this lot on Garland Street. Webster was the secretary of the W. F. Stewart Company, a carriage- building firm and then supplier for the automotive industry. The Garland Street neighborhood at that time was an upscale area home to many leading industrialists. In 1911, the Websters constructed the Tinlinn Apartments, as an upscale residence for upper middle-class businesspeople and professionals. The Websters lived in the Tinlinn until at least 1916, and the majority of the other early tenants were executives of businesses associated with the automobile industry. John C. Berridge, owner of the Flint Drug Company, purchased the Tinlinn in 1919 and moved in. In 1928, Berridge opened the next- door Berridge Hotel. The Tinlinn continued as a four-unit apartment building until it was closed in 1999; it was rehabilitated about ten years later and reopened, as part of the same project that rehabilitated the next-door Berridge Hotel. Description The Tinlinn Apartments is a two-story brick and stucco Arts and Crafts apartment building containing four units, two on each floor. The building sits on a raised foundation and has a hipped roof with deep overhanging eaves. The foundation level and the first story are clad with brick, with quoins at the corners; the second story is covered with stucco. A two-story central porch, three bays wide, fronts the main facade. The porch has a base and first floor railing matching the brick of the building, and four Tuscan columns continuing to the roof. The second floor of the porch has a wood railing between the columns. The porch shelters a central projecting entrance with a wood entrance door flanked by sidelights. Two sets of double-hung windows are located to each side. The second floor contains double-hung windows in the central by, with a wood entrance door and a double- hung window on each side. A wide hip-roof dormer is located in the center of the front roof.

It was designed by Stanley Rickard and built from 1906. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Burwood= Parramatta Road was first created in 1791, a vital land (cf water) artery between Sydney Cove and Rose Hill's settlement and crops. Liverpool Road opened in 1814 as Governor Macquarie's Great South Road. Its winding route reflects pre-existing land grant boundaries. To Burwood's north over Parramatta Road was Longbottom Government Farm, staffed by convicts. This grew to over on heavily timbered flat, sloping to swamps on Hen & Chicken Bay. Commissioner Bigge recorded how valuable timber (ironbark) was cut and sawn on the spot, conveyed to Sydney in boats by the river. \\"Charcoal for the forges and foundries is likewise prepared here\\" he noted. Two land grants were critical on Burwood's clay: Captain Thomas Rowley's Burwood Farm estate and William Faithful's grant to its south in Enfield covered most of modern Burwood. Rowley, adjutant of the NSW Corps, named it after the farm he'd lived on in Cornwall. 1799 and subsequent grants brought it to but he continued to live at Kingston Farm in Newtown until his death in 1806. He had bought some of the first Spanish merinos brought from the Cape Colony in 1797, others being sold to Macarthur, Marsden & Cox. The southern boundary of his farm was approximately Woodside Avenue & Fitzroy Street. Under Rowley's will, the estate passed to his three underage children - executors Dr Harris & Major Johnstone were both involved in the 1808 Bligh rebellion and returned to England for the court martial. Governor Macquarie appointed Thomas Moore as guardian and executor. In 1812 he wrongfully auctioned the estate. It was bought by Sydney businessman Alexander Riley. He is believed to have built Burwood Villa in 1814 (perhaps on older (1797) foundations of Rowley's shepherd's cottage) and lived here until departing for England in 1817. In 1824 Joseph Lycett described the estate. had been cleared for pasture. Lycett in Views of Australia described \\"a garden of 4 acres in full cultivation, containing upwards of three hundred Trees, bearing the following choice fruits, viz. The Orange, Citron, Lemon, Pomegranate, Loquat, Guava, Peaches, Nectarines, Apricots, Apples, Pears, the Cherry, Plums, Figs, Chestnuts, Almonds, Medlars, Quinces; with abundance of Raspberries, Strawberries, and the finest Melons. &c;\\". Until the 1830s Burwood consisted of a few inns along the highways and two or three huge, undeveloped estates within the next 20 years these began to break up, attracting settlers and encouraging the growth of embryo villages at Burwood & Enfield. Riley died in 1833 and Rowley's children, now of age, started legal proceedings and regained possession of the estate. It was divided between Thomas Jr., John, John Lucas* and Henry Biggs. Almost at once they subdivided it into lots of for country homes and small farms. In 1834 the Burwood estate was held by John Lucas, husband of Thomas's daughter Mary Rowley, who divided of his into small allotments for sale. Streets such as Webb, Lucas Road, Wentworth Road, & Strathfield's The Boulevarde reflect the boundaries of these subdivisions/estates. To the south (including the land later the Appian Way) was William Faithful's grant of (1808) at \\"Liberty Plains\\". Faithful was a private in the NSW Corps: discharged in 1799 he became Captain Foveaux's farm manager, and this connection got him the grant. Apart from of Sarah Nelson's on Malvern Hill (Croydon), Faithful's Farm extended from Rowley's farm to Cooks River and west to Punchbowl Road. The government retained a right to build a road through it (doing so in 1815: Liverpool or the Great South Road), and to cut \\"such timber as may be deemed fit for naval purposes\\" - the area was thick with tall ironbark. Faithful exchanged it in 1815. Alexander Riley bought his north of the new road incorporating it into his Burwood estate. This was jointly owned by the Rowley family after 1833 and had no streets across it, only a few tracks. Despite opening up of the Rowley estate, there was little settlement in Burwood between the two highways before 1860. Sydney Railway Company opened the first rail to Parramatta in 1855. Burwood \\"station\\" (just west of Ashfield station, one of the first stations) was a wooden platform near a level crossing over the grassy track that was Neich's Lane* (later Burwood Road). This was beside \\"the newly laid out township of Cheltenham\\". Speedy transport meant subdivision and consolidation followed, filling out the area. Burwood's biggest growth spurt was between 1874 and 1900 (Burwood's population was, respectively: 1200-7400, an increase not matched since). *1835 maps show this as the only track between Parramatta / Liverpool Roads in Burwood. Burwood's first public school appeared in . In 1843, land on Burwood Road was granted to the Anglican Church for a school. St. Mary's Catholic Church opened in 1846, a Presbyterian Church, in 1857 and St. Paul's Anglican, in 1871. Mansions of the 1870s+ such as The Priory were due to a firm belief in its health-giving climate, compared to the smog and crowding of the city suburbs. They were built as quasi-ancestral estates, perhaps in blissful ignorance of how quickly suburbs can evolve. Living was primitive: no street lighting (1883+), home lighting by candle or lamp (oil, kerosene after 1860), no gas (1882+), no piped water (1886+), home wells and tanks, few bathrooms, no indoor toilets, with pans (1880+) replacing outdoor cess pits. The 1880s+ was the era of the debates that led to Australia's fractious states combining into a single Federation, declared at Sydney's Centennial Park in 1901. Skilled tradesmen and materials were plentiful and comparatively cheap, and combined with the improvement in building techniques associated with cavity walls, damp-courses and terracotta tiled rooves, provided the means for an era of intense building activity. Unlike the Victorian era's large commercial and Government building, the main thrust of the Federation era was constructing new suburbs around Sydney harbour with shops for the middle classes. Between 1889 and 1918 Australia's population swelled from 3 to 5 million triggering an urgent need for housing. Suburban spread was greatly assisted by expansion of the public transport system of trams, ferries and trams, which formed a well-integrated pre-car transport system. Rapid suburban growth brought increased interest in town planning and the British concept (Ebenezer Howard's 'Garden City') of the Garden Suburb, spurred on by the Federal Capital Competition of 1912. 1913's arrival from North America of winners, Walter Burley & Marion Mahony Griffin, saw formation of the Town Planning Association of New South Wales, with architect John Sulman as president. Founding members Sulman and J. P. Fitzgerald were among witnesses at the 1900 Royal Commission into the Improvement of the City of Sydney and suburbs. This made the first attempt at a comprehensive review of Sydney's problems, gathering many reform ideas. It recognised the relationship between planning and local government and advocated introduction of a town planning bill along the lines of John Burns' 1900 English Bill. Some recommendations, such as introducing building regulations for the whole metropolitan area \\"to prevent the straggling of suburbs and to ensure development along harmonious lines\\" went into 1919's Local Government Act. The \\"Garden Suburb\\" came to mean a suburb with special areas zoned for different uses, e.g.: residential and commercial; an absence of attached terraces with free-standing houses, wide tree-lined streets, \\"nature strips\\" on footpaths, parks reserves and gardens. Much-derided rear lanes and rights-of-way became redundant with sewerage and the provision of side access between houses. Verandas and bay windows were means of integrating house & garden. Tree-lined streets such as Burwood Rd., The Appian Way or The Boulevard in Strathfield were in marked contrast to most development in Australian cities of the late 19th century.Fraser, Hugh, in Heritage Council of NSW, 1981-4, amended and added to by Stuart Read, 17/5/2008 with excerpts from Eric Dunlop (1975). =Lynton= Lynton was designed for Arthur Hezlett by architect Stanley Rickard in 1906. The Burwood Historical Society and the National Trust of Australia (N.S.W) nominated a group of Federation houses in Burwood for protection under the Heritage Act in 1981. An Interim Conservation Order was placed on the heritage precinct on 20 November 1981. This nomination came into being principally because Lynton exhibited similar features to a fine collection of Federation-style mansions that formed a coherent and well preserved streetscape. There were initially five houses protected in the precinct, all of Federation design. It was agreed that the order should be allowed to expire on the precinct as the area would be protected under a local environment plan, but that Lynton one of the most outstanding buildings should be protected by a Permanent Conservation Order. When Lynton was purchased by an Alderman of Burwood in 1985, the building was converted for use as a reception centre. In the process of conversion, the removal of walls between the major rooms took place. It was at the time in derelict condition. The owner subsequently restored the house. Lynton was listed on the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  =Site= Lynton is prominently sited on a rising ridge, set back from Clarence Street. Once there was a circular driveway in front. Note the remains of the circular rose garden and beds for annuals. Art Nouveau detailing inside and in the leadlight windows with plant imagery throughout.Heritage Council, 1981-4: Heritage Council of NSW, Conservation of the Federation House, a series of one-day seminars, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984 - Walking Tour notes by Phillip Clements & Helen Powell, modified by Stuart Read. (front to Clarence Street). A tall hedge of Photinia robusta planted in the 1980s screens much of a view of the house from Clarence Street but provides privacy. The entry gate has a lych gate over it, stone steps and a path to the north-western side of the house. Mature trees include a cock's comb coral tree (Erythrina crista- galli), fan palm (Washingtonia robusta) and Bhutan cypresses (Cupressus torulosa). (Rear to Church Street), Federation-style stables with ornamental ridge-capping on roof. Note the house's wooden fretwork and verandah columns. NB: Cocos Is./Queen palms & Lord Howe Island palms.Read, Stuart, pers. comm., 17/5/2008 =House= An ornate and highly individual treatment of the Federation idiom, the house displays a complexity of form and materials, ranging from its multi-gabled roof line, roughcast render and leaded quarry windows, to vigorous application to flat carved timber and stone work. Its ballroom is on the right hand side of the front door. The grandeur of this setting was quite deliberately achieved with the house capturing so well the architectural qualities of the time. The most distinctive feature of this house is its picturesque roofline. Ornamentation was not just restricted to the roof; wood, glass and tiles were the other main modes of decoration. The influence of Art Nouveau is displayed throughout the house and can be seen in the plaster ceiling of the drawing room and entry hall. In the design of windows and doors, plants are depicted in leadlight with the vegetation, such as leaves and flowers buds, twining from the base of the design towards the top.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Lynton was designed as an individual house set in its own garden. The house was built in Federation style giving a unity to the area not usually found in other development of the time. Lynton only represents an important period in Australian architectural and social history but, indeed, reflects the concept of the time.Balaz and Issa 1986 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Lynton exhibits many of the features that are distinctive to the Federation Style. Visible is the gabled high pitched roof. Double hung and the use of leadlight and stained glass windows are also apparent. Detailed timber columns and valances range along the verandah with the motif repeated in the window hoods and the barge boards. The upper floor is set within the roof space in the form of gabled dormers. Gables are half timbered and stuccoed and the roof is slte with terracotta ridgings. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is the only house remaining in the block on a large area of land with frontage to Clarance Street. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Lynton is a distinctive example of the Federation Style. Lynton only represents an important period in Australian architectural and social history but, indeed, reflects the concept of the time.

It was designed and built by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage in 1922. It is also known as Sewer Vent and Paisley Road Sewer Vent. The property is owned by Sydney Water, a statutory corporation of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  The Main Western Carrier which fed into Botany sewer farm was completed in 1897 and encompasses the major crossing of Wolli Creek and Cooks River each by triple barrel 1800 mm dia. wrought iron/steel aqueducts. There are triple barrel brick arch aqueducts at the ends. Soon after construction more sewage was being collected from this newer Western arm than there was from the original Southern Division arm. This is even with allowing for dramatic increase in flow within the first few years of the Southern Division. The Western Branch Main Sewer which feeds into the Main Western Carrier was completed in stages all the way through to Strathfield. Work was completed on this sewer in 1904. The section also contains the Croydon (1922) and Burwood (Strathfield) (1919) concrete vent stacks which were built because of damage caused by gases from the then new Homebush Abattoir after it opened in 1916. In 1888 before the Botany Scheme was even commissioned, Burwood Council had requested a sewage treatment plant for Hen & Chicken Bay on the Parramatta River. They were told by the NSW Government to wait for the Western Suburbs Sewer and the Western Branch Main Sewer is the result of that undertaking. Had the Burwood scheme proceeded, the Western Branch Main Sewer may not have been built in the location it was eventually constructed.  Description  A reinforced concrete vent stack built in 1922, octagonal in plan form up to the top of the pedestal from which begins a tapered shaft circular in section with radiating support ribs and three octagonal concrete bands along the length of the shaft. There are neo classical console brackets at the top of the shaft underneath a projecting cornice. The pedestal would be approximately 6m high. A steel entrance door is on the eastern elevation below a rendered hood mould over the door. A galvanised corrugated iron shed is located a metre to the north of this vent stack over the manhole to the main. The location of the site of the vent shaft is directly off Paisley Road and is a triangular site all now paved in concrete. Adjoining development is domestic from the early 20th century, and across the road is the railway line. Condition overall would appear to be good with some evidence of horizontal cracking towards the upper portions of the pedestal. Some spalling is evident up the shaft. A lightning conductor is located on the southern side of the shaft. The vent shaft is prominently located and the surrounding topography makes this shaft a landmark for a considerable distance from most vantage points. A lack of large scale and high density buildings contributes to its relatively open visual qualities within this urban environment. This shaft has a larger scale base than that of the Wentworth Road shaft. Evidence remains on the street frontage of an original timber gate post some 6 inches squared with original coach bolts and gudgeons still in place. A late 20th century wire cage gate and steel frame is now fitted to the entry of the site. The shaft and its surrounding fence has little if any immediate streetscape value or give little if any contribution to the surrounding dwellings, although its landmark quality to the broader townscape is most notable. The paling fence would appear to be late 20th century and not original. Considerably intact.  Heritage listing  As at 4 January 2001, the vent shaft is a locally prominent landmark and one of only two like structures in Sydney Water's system, which plays an important function to the main western sewer system. The unusual design and reinforced concrete construction is rare for this type of vent on a State level. Croydon Sewer Vent was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The vent has tangible historical associations with the western branch main sewer and through the influence of sewer gases generated from the Homebush abattoir, an element which has now been removed forever. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The vent is a prominent landmark visually, particularly to the considerable area west and south of the vent stack. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is likely the vent stack holds some value to the local community in its function and landmark value. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The vent plays an important function in the servicing of the western branch main sewer. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Regarding its design and construction it is rare on a State level and one of only two in the Sydney Water system. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. In terms of vent function alone, it is representative of the function it has played in the operation of sewer systems.

She is remembered in particular for the important part she played in the activities of the Danish Women's Society (Dansk Kvindesamfund), especially around 1915 when the Danish Constitution was amended to include women's suffrage. She was a co-founder of Lyngby-T√•rb√¶k Local Historic Society (Historisk-Topografisk Selskab for Lyngby-T√•rb√¶k) in 1927. Early life and family Born in Copenhagen on 17 April 1866, Ellen Gyrithe Frisch was the daughter of the headmaster Hartvig Frisch (1833‚Äì90) and Elisabeth Alexandra Mourier (1835‚Äì92). On 19 July 1893, she married the physician Johan Henrich Lemche (1863‚Äì1962). Ellen Gyrithe spent her early years in Copenhagen's Store Kongensgade before moving with her family to Lyngby where her maternal grandparents lived. Together with her three siblings, she was first educated at home, then attended N. Zahle's School. On matriculating, she began to study German at the University of Copenhagen but soon gave up, discouraged by the males dominated environment she experienced. Instead she became a teacher at her father's school until her marriage in 1893. Despite giving birth to three children, one of whom died when two years old, she devoted herself to writing, leaving her children to the care of her husband and the household staff. Career as a writer Her first book, the semi-biographical novel Soedtmanns Jomfruer, portrays the history of the inhabitants of Lyngby, including her relatives, from medieval times to the present. Her interest in local history later led to her becoming a co-founder of the Lyngby-T√•rb√¶k History Society (Historisk-Topografisk Selskab for Lyngby-T√•rb√¶k) in 1927. In 1899, she published Folkets Synder which brought out the lack of attention given to women's sexuality. Her most important work was however the family novel Edwardsgave which was published in five volumes from 1900 to 1912, set principally in the 18th century. She also published De Fyrstenberg B√∏nder (1905), depicting the lives of farmers in Gentofte in the 18th and 19th centuries. Involvement as a women's rights activist Gyrithe Lemche and Julie Arentholt in 1922 In 1906, her elder sister Vibeke Salicath who was a board member of the Danish Women's Society, invited her to the society's national convention. In 1910, Lemche was appointed to the board and under Astrid Stampe Feddersen's presidency from 1913 to 1918 became the organization's most active ideologist and effective leader. She is remembered in particular for her speech in 1912 calling for reforms to the constitution in order to allow women to vote. The amendment was adopted in 1915. Lemche also took on the task of editing the society's journal Kvinden og Samfundet (Woman and Society) from 1913 to 1919. Although she retired from the presidency of the Women's Society in 1918, to be replaced by Julie Arenholt, she remained active in the organization, becoming an honorary member in 1944. Lemche's experiences as a women's activist are described in her three-volume semi-autobiographical novel Tempeltjenere (1926‚Äì28). She was active in other women's organizations such as Kvindernes Bygning which she chaired from 1916 to 1929. She also served on the board of Dansk Forfatterforening (Danish Authors' Society).

The station is also served by commuter and regional rail services from Euskotren Trena. The station is located in the neighbourhood of Matiko-Ciudad Jard√≠n, part of the Uribarri district of Bilbao. In its current form, the station opened on 8 April 2017.  History  The original station, named Matico, opened on 30 June 1887 as part of the narrow-gauge Bilbao-Las Arenas railway, which connected the city of Bilbao with Getxo. Matico was also the terminus station of the Matico-Azbarren railway, a narrow-gauge mostly underground suburban railway that connected the peripheral municipality of Basauri with central Bilbao at Matico. The station was an open-air station located in a trench in the Matiko neighbourhood; to the south the railtracks entered two different tunnels, one headed to Bilbao-San Agust√≠n station, terminus of the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway, and another towards Azbarren, as part of the Matico-Azbarren railway, whereas to the north a single railtrack continued to the University of Deusto station. In 1904 it was integrated into the Bilbao-Plencia railway, and a third tunnel was opened towards Bilbao-Aduana station, which replaced Bilbao-San Agust√≠n as the terminus station of the line. During the early 20th century, three different railway lines called or passed through Matico station; the passenger Bilbao-Plencia and Matico-Azbarren railways and freight trains headed to Bilbao-San Agust√≠n station. Matico station became a relevant hub for the city's narrow gauge railways, due to being the location of where the single railtrack coming from Getxo and Plentzia branched into three different tunnels. In 1947 the city's narrow gauge railways merged to form the Ferrocarriles y Transportes Suburbanos de Bilbao S.A. (Railways and Suburban Transport of Bilbao), shortened FTS and the first precedent of today's Metro Bilbao. The branch towards Bilbao-San Agust√≠n was closed down in 1973 In 1977 the FTS network was transferred to the public company FEVE and in 1982 to the recently created Basque Railways. The station, then renamed Matiko following the modern Basque orthography, was then part of a series of renovation projects commissioned by the Basque Government which included the creation of the Metro Bilbao's line 1 using sections of the Bilbao-Plencia and Matico- Azbarren railways, which caused Matiko to become disconnected from both lines, as the station was not part of the new metro network. The tunnel and railtrack connecting the station with Azbarren were closed down. After the opening of Metro Bilbao in 1995, Matiko was integrated into the new Txorierri line operated separately by Euskotren and that ran between Deusto and Zazpi Kaleak through the sections that had not been integrated into the metro network, and from there to Lezama in the Txorierri valley. The station was partially renovated with a new island platform, while maintaining the original open-air structure of the original station. The project for Metro Bilbao's Line 3 was made public in 2007. The new line was planned to connect Etxebarri and Matiko through the Otxarkoaga-Txurdinaga district and the old town. The project involved the renovation of the Matiko station, and the works were commissioned in 2010. The new project involved Matiko becoming the northern terminus of the new line, before connecting to a new tunnel through Mount Artxanda to ensure connection with the existing Txorierri line. As a consequence, the section between Deusto and Matiko, the last remaining from the former Bilbao-Plencia line, were dismantled, shutting down the services in Deusto and Deusto- University stations in 2010. Matiko station was also closed down to be demolished, with the plans of a new one to be built in its place. The new underground Matiko station opened on 8 April 2017, integrated into Metro Bilbao's line 3, which is operated by Euskotren Trena.  Station layout  Matiko is a partially underground station, built on the site of a former railway trench in the district of Uribarri in Bilbao. = Access = * 20px 30 Tiboli St. * 20px Accessible entry point 21 Tiboli St.  Services  = Metro services = The station is part of line 3 of Metro Bilbao, which unlike the other lines is operated by Euskotren Trena. = Rail services = The station is also served by commuter-rail and regional services operated by Euskotren Trena. = Future services = The station will be the southern terminus of a new line connecting the city centre with the Bilbao Airport.

It was designed by Albert Bond and built from 1869 to 1888 in the Victorian Second Empire architectural style. It is also known as Shubra Hall, including stables and garden, Presbyterian Ladies College, PLC Croydon and Hordernville. The property is owned by the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 December 2014.  History  =Indigenous history= Archaeological evidence found in the Sydney region indicates Aboriginal occupation dating from over 5,000 years ago. At the time of European colonisation there were three main Aboriginal tribes or linguistic groups in the Sydney region ‚Äì the Guringai (north of Sydney Harbour), the Tharawal (south of Botany Bay) and the Dharug (around the Harbour and to the west) ‚Äì who are the traditional owners of this land. The arrival of British penal settlement in 1788 had a devastating effect on Aboriginal life within the region. The introduction of many diseases resulted in the deaths of half the Sydney population within two years. Although there is archaeological evidence of Aboriginal occupation in the Municipality of Ashfield (including midden deposits), there is none known within the boundaries of the listing. =Great lands, construction and private ownership= Shubra Hall is located on part of granted to Captain Thomas Rowley on 9 August 1803 (Burwood Estate) and on part of granted to Augustus Alt, Surveyor General to the Colony (Ashfield Park Estate). These two grants covered most of Burwood and Croydon. Thirteen acres and two roods of land were consolidated under a single Certificate of TitleVol 70 Fol24 on 4 August 1868 in the name of Anthony Horden III, draper, in the City of Sydney. Tertius, as he was known, owned the fabulous Hordern department store in Sydney with his brother Samuel. Their father noted that Tertius \\"has bought a farm at Ashfield for A¬£1200 ‚Äì he has agreed to pay ¬£500 cash, the rest on mortgage.\\" He moved out of his cottage near his father's home at Darling Point and lived initially in the stables at Croydon 'in order to supervise the work more closely'Hordern, 1985 including the fencing of of land. This suggests that the stables pre-date the main house, however there are no known original design drawings for house, stables or garden. The design of \\"Shubra Hall\\" has been attributed to architect Albert Bond, who achieved prominence as City Architect between 1873 and 1877, and was long associated with the Hordern brothers. He designed the Anthony Hordern and Sons department store building in the Haymarket and their New Palace Emporium on Brickfield Hill, as well as Sam's home at Bowral. He also designed the school buildings adjoining Shubra Hall for PLC in 1889‚Äì90. Shubra Hall was a \\"Villa Garden\\", based on the notion of \\"a country mansion built together with farm-buildings and occupied by a person of some position and wealth\\".Aitken, 2002, p618 The architectural style of the residence is identifiable as \\"Victorian Second Empire\\" and unusual for being found in a domestic residence.Apperly et al, 1989 H. G. Woffenden discussed the design in his PhD on nineteenth century architecture in NSW: Anthony III named his new home \\"Shubra Hall\\" for reasons that are now obscure; \\"Shubra\\" was also used as a middle name for members of the Hordern family at that time. the place was also known as Shubra Park and Hordernville in the Sands Directory. The house appears to have been completed by September 1869 when the birth of a son to Mrs Anthony Hordern III \\"at her residence, Shubra Park, Ashfield\\" was announced in The Sydney Morning Herald. A short time before, Hordern had put his signature on a counter petition opposing the formation of Burwood Municipal Council, identifying himself as a resident of the district. The Hordern family \\"created many celebrated gardens around their residences\\". Anthony ('Tertius') Hordern III's Shubra Hall is described by Tanner and Britton in their entry on the family's gardens in The Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens as'a high-Victorian villa on a landscaped hilltop (now Presbyterian Ladies College) at Croydon'. There is also mention of his father Anthony Hordern's Retford Hall at Darling Point and country seat Retford Park in Bowral, his brother Samuel Hordern's Babworth House at Darling Point, and other close relatives, Anthony Hordern's Milton Park at Bowral, Lebbeus Hordern's Hopewood House, Edward Carr Hordern's Chislehurst at Chatswood and Alfred Hordern's Highlands house designed by John Horbury Hunt at Wahroonga.Tanner and Britton, 2002 Within three years of purchasing the land in 1868, Hordern undertook the first subdivision of his property. A proposed second subdivision of his property, \\"Hawthordern Estate\\" was cancelled in December 1880. Shubra Hall was located on the largest parcel Anthony Hordern advertised for an auction sale on 14 April 1882, where it was described as \\"that delightfully situated and tastefully designed family mansion on the hill, north of Croydon Railway Station, comprising a magnificent mansion and improved grounds; area about 5 acres\\". The advertisement contained a detailed description of the house and grounds. Tertius appears to have remained in occupation of Shubra Hall until September when he advertised the auction sale of \\"the whole of his very elegant and recherche household furniture and effects ... in consequence of his projected departure for England\\". The Mutual Provident Land Investing and Building Society (Limited) sold Shubra Hall and grounds (comprising four acres and three roods) in December 1882 to John Coghlan of Pitt Street, Sydney, Diamond Drill owner, for a sum of ¬£6,489. John Coghlan and his family had moved into Shubra Hall by June 1884. The Australian Town and Country Journal published an illustrated feature article in which Shubra Hall was depicted with the following description: Coghlan was an active member of the Croydon community. In May 1886 he attended a large public meeting of residents and property-holders to demand the Government provide better station accommodation, formation of a goods siding and purchase of a public park at Croydon. He was elected to the executive committee which was formed at this meeting. In the same year a notice appeared reporting the birth of a daughter to Mrs J. Coghlan of Shubra Hall, Croydon. Coghlan experienced severe financial stress in 1889, on the eve of the 1890s depression, and was unable to sustain the mortgage payments on Shubra Hall. Coghlan and family moved to Glebe Point where he died in July 1896 aged 6l, leaving behind a widow and seven children. The auction sale of Shubra Hall was advertised on 3 September 1889, and it sold to John Hay Goodlet, Alexander Dean and James Balfour Elphinstone, guarantors of the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales, for the reported sum of ¬£7,500. =Presbyterian Ladies' College and Shubra Hall= Shubra Hall, 1892 In 1883 the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales resolved to locate a site, obtain funds and establish a Ladies' College in New South Wales. In 1887 several gentlemen from the Presbyterian Church signed a lease on a gentleman's residence at Ashfield, \\"Femlea\\", commencing on 7 January 1888. The General Assembly appointed Dr John Marden principal of the College and he and his family took up temporary residence there while seeking a permanent site for the school. Within the first month there were 30 students enrolled in the Presbyterian Ladies College (PLC), of which 15 were boarders. By year's end student numbers had increased rapidly and accommodation for boarders was stretched. The church continued looking for permanent accommodation for the school. About this time Shubra Hall at Croydon was advertised for sale, and was duly purchased at auction by Church representatives, Goodlet, Dean and Elphinstone. Following the acquisition, a committee was formed in November to decide upon the requirements for additional school buildings needed on the site and select an architect. Documentation confirms that Albert Bond was appointed architect for the extension (even if it cannot be confirmed that he was the original architect of Shubra Hall). 'By the beginning of the school year of 1891 the new site was complete and ready to commence functioning as the permanent home of P.L.C. The total cost of the new buildings and renovations was ¬£25,000.'McFarlane, 1988 The new Presbyterian Ladies College at Croydon was officially opened in March 1891 by the Governor of New South Wales. The main college building, comprising Boarding House, Dining Room and College Hall, \\"adjoins the residence of the principal, Dr John Marden\\" (Shubra Hall) and stands \\"in the midst of a spacious block of ground, six acres in extent, which is being laid out in lawn tennis courts, gardens, etc, in an elevated position, it forms, with its tower high, a very conspicuous feature in the landscape\\". The Australian Dictionary of Biography entry on \\"John Marden\\" mentions that he trained as a lawyer but was \\"keenly interested in horticulture\\" and \\"laid out beautiful gardens and playing fields\\" for the Croydon campus. He did the same again when he moved to Pymble in 1916 after were purchased for an additional campus for the school.Dougan, 1986 An anonymous historical account describing the fostering of science at PLC in part through the nurturing of the gardens explains:‚àö An anonymous short history of Shubra Hall dating from around 1986 describes the different uses of the mansion within the school:Anonymous, =Anthony (Tertius) Hordem III, (built and occupied Shubra Hall 1868‚Äì1882)= Anthony Hordem III (known as Tertius) was born on 24 July 1842 at Melbourne, the eldest son of Anthony Hordern (1817‚Äì1876). He was educated in Sydney, Melbourne and at Rugby, England. By 1869 his father (also Anthony) had taken him and his brother into partnership in the family department store business, which was then vigorously expanded. In 1878 \\"The Warehouse\\" and the \\"Palace Emporium\\" were constructed and commenced operation. According to the Bulletin, 22 May 1880, they \\"fairly ruled the retail trade of the metropolis and the colony in general\\". They adopted the trade-mark of the spreading oak over the motto, 'While I live I'll grow'. In 1881‚Äì82 the company opened offices in Britain, the Continent, America and China. In 1883 Tertius proposed a scheme to the Legislative Council of Western Australia called the Beverly-Albany Railway Scheme, for which he formed a syndicate in England to construct a railway line and encourage migration. Tertius died at sea from brain fever on 16 September 1886 on his return voyage to Australia, aged just 44. He left an estate of ¬£190,800, and was survived by four children and his wife Elizabeth. =John Francis Coghlan (occupied Shubra Hall 1882‚Äì1889)= John Francis Coghlan was born in Ireland in 1835 and may have arrived in Australia with the Victorian gold rush in the 1850s. According to an obituary which appeared in the Freeman's Joumal, Coghlan's connection to mining commenced in the early 1850s in Victoria \\"and what money he made then and subsequently was employed in the development of mining\\". By 1874 he was in Sydney where he married Josephine Murphy in St Mary's Church. Four years later he formed the Australian Diamond Rock Drill and Boring Company Limited to manufacture diamond rock drills and commenced his own boring experiments at the Sydney Coal Company's works at Newington on the Parramatta River. The experiment was not successful and he turned his attention to other sites in the vicinity of Sydney, drilling bores at Port Hacking, Holt-Sutherland, Moorebank, Heathcote, and Moore Park and Rose Bay. He discovered two fine seams of coal at Stockton and Cockle Creek in Newcastle. In 1889, Coghlan was declared insolvent and was forced to sell his residence at Croydon. With his large family he moved to Glebe Point where he died on 10 July 1896, aged 61 years. =Albert Bond (attributed architect of Shubra Hall)= Albert Bond was appointed the first full time architect to the Municipal Council of Sydney and served in that position from 1873 to 1877. He is believed to be responsible for the detailed design of the turrets, addition of the stained glass dome and for the decoration of the Vestibule of the Sydney Town Hall. Following his resignation he formed his own architectural practice with offices in Bell's Chamber, 129 Pitt Street. He was responsible for the design of a large number of stores and commercial buildings, but his most notable buildings were the two Anthony Hordern and Sons department stores in Sydney. Bond died on 27 March 1923 at Omrah Private Hospital. He never married. His substantial body of work includes: *Anthony Hordern and Sons, The Palace Emporium and The New Palace Emporium *Harrison, Jones & Devlin, wool and produce store (1882) *Farmer & Co store (1883) *Presbyterian Church, Botany (1879) *Athanaeum Club, Sydney (1887) *Retford Park, Old South Road, Bowral, for Samuel Hordern in a Victorian Italianate style (1887) *Congregational Church, Pitt Street (internal alterations) (1879) *Congregational Church, Hunters Hill *Sydney Female Refuge, Glebe (1902) *Ragged School, Harrington Street (1873) *Agricultural Society Show ‚Äì pavilions for Anderson & Co at Moore Park (1899) *Scot's Church Manse, Sydney (1882) *Equitable Permanent Benefit Building, Land and Savings Society Building (l886) \\"Southall\\", 88 Barney Street, Armidale (1886). ;Comparative places Comparable mansions include Tertius' father Anthony Hordern's Retford Hall designed by Edmund Blacket, Darling Point (demolished 1967) and Tertius' brother Samuel Hordern's Retford Park, Old South Road, Bowral, 1887, designed by Albert Bond. Glenworth, Victoria Street, Ashfield is an Italianate mansion with tower designed by G A Morell and a later example of suburban mansion originally built in a semi-rural setting in Sydney's inner west. Yaralla, Concord, is an Italianate house built -59 with tower. The Second Empire style is more commonly found in public and commercial architecture, including the Sydney Town Hall.  Description  =Context= Shubra Hall is situated within the grounds of Presbyterian Ladies College (PLC Croydon), which is located on the border and thus within both of the Ashfield and Burwood municipal local government areas, in the inner western suburbs, approximately 11 km from the city centre of Sydney. =Shubra Hall= Shubra Hall is a grand two-storey mansion dating from 1864, which is designed in the \\"Victorian Second Empire\\" architectural style.Apperly et al, 1989, pp68-69 The centrepiece of a private secondary school campus since 1889 it is now surrounded by school buildings of various ages. The SHR listing encloses the original residential building in its garden setting and including its original stables building. The general form of Shubra Hall consists of the original two storey residential building facing east, which features well-detailed, high- ceilinged rooms designed for living and entertaining. On the ground floor there were two drawings rooms, a dining room and a breakfast room and on the first floor there were three large bedrooms with anterooms. On the rear, western side of the building are two service wings extending towards the west. The northern wing is considered to be part of the original 1869 design while the southern wing is thought to have been added by the Coghlan family in the 1880s.The northern wing held the original kitchen, provision rooms and laundry on the ground floor, with servants' bedrooms on the first floor. The house was finely detailed with costly materials and decorations. The brick walls are rendered inside and out. The exterior decoration includes moulded entablatures and rounded arches and pilasters, to which the architect has added idiosyncratic detailing including Romanesque dentils in the arches, French Renaissance eaves and chimney corbels, and Aesthetic Movement column capitals under the entry arch. The tower has banded patterns of slate. The entry steps are in black slate. The floors of the veranda and entry are elaborately patterned in tessellated tiles. The interiors are decorated with fine joinery, likely cedar, in the grandly scaled skirtings, doors, windows and the main stair case that has helix-shaped balustrade and newel posts that reference the columns under the entry arch. The joinery is simpler within the service wings and tower. All the cornices are moulded plaster profiles. Decorative cast plaster is featured in the consoles, decorative panels and colonnettes under the arches, and also in the ceiling roses. The ceilings are commonly lath and plaster, but the drawing rooms have a shallow pattern that may be pressed metal. The marble mantelpieces are commonly white, with a dark grey in the dining room, typical of those constructed in Australia using imported stone, coloured tiles and cast iron grates. =Stables and gardens= The stables are extensively altered within, but retain their external form seen from the east and north. The gardens retains some typical Victorian period landscape devices. The oval-shaped driveway and garden bed on the east side of the house (not included in the curtilage) give a formal sense of arrival. This shape is repeated in the eastern lawn with its original steps, arranged on an axis from the front door. The massive scale of araucarias is used as landmark planting, featuring Norfolk Island pines. The camphor laurel south-east of the house is likely to have been planted by the Hordern Family. The Victorians' love of exotic plant collections is demonstrated by cold climate trees such as blue deodar cedar, and deciduous trees such as oak (Quercus petraea), elm (Ulmus glabra), which contrast with warm climate plants such as Strelitzia nicolai. The palm groves are typically Victorian as a collection of many species arranged like a tropical forest, but they were likely planted in the Federation period. Key species include jelly palm (Butia capitata), Canary Island palm (Phoenix canariensis), cabbage palm (Livistona australis), Livistona chinensis, kentia and curly palms (Howea fosterana and belmoreana), bangalow palm (Archontophoenix cunninghamia), windmill palm (Tracycarpus fortunie), cotton palm (Washingtonia filifera). = Condition = As at 10 September 2014, the house, stables and gardens are in generally good condition. Highly intact to its state at the end of the Nineteenth Century. There is no visible sign of original service ducting. = Modifications and dates = *Mid-1880s: Construction of the two-storey southern service wing. *. Construction of PLC school buildings adjacent to Shubra Hall. *: high quality Art Nouveau glasswork installed in the entry doors and side lights at both ends of the entry hall. The reasoning for replacing the glass is unknown. It is thought that perhaps the original glass was broken or it contained imagery unsuited to a Presbyterian school. *20th century: Various partitions have been constructed inside to enable the mansion to be used as school offices. *1949: The courtyard was redesigned when garden beds were put in limiting the open space available for walking and sitting.Stackhouse, 1982 *Early 1980s: Tanner and Cox Architects, working with landscape architect Catherin Bull (an alumnus of the school) conserved buildings and grounds over several years, for example, taking out the garden beds planted in 1949 to allow more space in the courtyard. A new pergola-covered walkway was designed to link the buildings on either side and provide the fourth wall for the quadrangle. *1984: James Indsto, a landscape gardener, did a survey of the gardens as part of his studies.Anonymous, 1997. *1987: Miss Lambie of the Royal Botanic Gardens listed garden specimens. *1997: horticulturist Anne Fraser was documenting the gardens.  Heritage listing  As at 10 September 2014, Shubra Hall is of state aesthetic significance as a grand and largely intact example of the Victorian Second Empire style applied to a domestic residence. On an elevated site retaining some views to the harbour from its tower, it retains its relationship with its remnant stables and its garden landscaping which includes elements dating from the late nineteenth century to the present. Shubra Hall also has state significance for its association with the life of Anthony (Tertius) Hordern III, a leading retailer in New South Wales in the mid Victorian period. Together with his brother Samuel, he was responsible for the vigorous expansion of the Hordern department store business. Shubra Hall also has association and social significance for its ongoing association with the Presbyterian Ladies College (PLC Croydon) for over 120 years. Shubra Hall was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 December 2014 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Shubra Hall has state significance for its association with the life of Anthony (Tertius) Hordern III, a leading retailer in New South Wales in the mid Victorian period. Together with his brother Samuel, he was responsible for the vigorous expansion of the Hordern department store business. Shubra Hall also has significance for its ongoing association with the Presbyterian Ladies College at Croydon for over 120 years. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Shubra Hall is of state aesthetic significance as a grand and largely intact example of the Victorian Second Empire style applied to a domestic residence. On an elevated site retaining some views to the harbour from its tower, it retains its relationship with its remnant stables and its garden landscaping which includes elements dating from the late nineteenth century to the present. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Shubra Hall has a special association with the community of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon. This association reaches the threshold for local listing, but is unlikely to reach the threshold for State listing. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Shubra Hall may have research potential to provide information useful to a study of the Hordern Family, the architecture of Albert Bond, mid-Victorian construction techniques, and the domestic and working life on a large estate. Shubra Hall satisfies this criterion at a local level, but is not so rare as to satisfy this criterion at a state level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Shubra Hall has state significance as a representative example of a nineteenth century garden villa estate surviving in what is now the inner-western suburbs of Sydney. It demonstrates the popularity of land along the Redfern-Parramatta Railway for residential development by the wealthy, relieved to be away from the poor conditions then found in the harbour port and city area. With business interests in the central business district, owners could easily access their businesses via the railway. Its subsequent history of being acquired by a private school and adapted to institutional use is also representative of similar nineteenth century NSW estates.

Early life and education Cunningham was born November 26, 1955, in Springfield, Massachusetts. She attended Classical High School in Springfield. Fleeing the Genovese family's oppressive treatment of women, she moved to New York City in 1973, where she attended Hunter College. The following year, she performed in ‚ÄúEmily Likes the TV‚Äù with Christopher Knowles and Cindy Lubar at The Kitchen in Manhattan. She holds a master's degree in communication from Barry University in Miami and is certified as an art, video and film production instructor. Career The plight of immigrants has always been a deep concern of Cunningham's. Starting in 1991, Cunningham's family used money she received as compensation for her cement-truck injuries to support refugees fleeing Haiti after the ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. She and Eves purchased Tap Tap Restaurant the following year and hired Haitian artists to decorate the interior; after extensive renovations, it opened in 1994. Cunningham and Eves raised their two daughters above Tap Tap, which quickly became an award-winning restaurant featuring Haitian cuisine and Caribbean cocktails, Haitian bands and karaoke nights. Cunningham continued to support the refugee community in other ways, as well. In 1994, she collaborated with Lou Anne Colodny, director of the Center for Contemporary Art (now the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami), to showcase Haitian artists at a comprehensive exhibition. Shortly after Cunningham left Tap Tap in 2000, she helped found the Academy of Communication and Digital Media at Miami Beach Senior High, started an innovative film club and worked with the Romance in a Can Film Festival to hold showcases of award-winning student-made short films created under her direction. In 2007, she produced an award-winning television commercial for Discovery Espanol with her student filmmakers. From 2001 until 2010, Cunningham worked with artists commissioned by the Miami Light Project and taught filmmaking for Nike Filmmakers‚Äô Bootcamp. After leaving teaching in 2011, Cunningham became fascinated with boats and water during an artist residency in 2014 in Varanasi, a Holy City in India. There, she watched residents and tourists bathe and pour the ashes of cremated bodies into the sacred Ganges River, a ritual Hindus believe releases the soul from the cycle of rebirth, a concept known as moksha. Since that time, as a tribute to this sacred tradition, she has floated and installed paper boats in Russia, Haiti and Mexico, all of which can be seen in her videos on her website. In 2011, 2013 and 2015, Cunningham created installations for the ghetto Biennale in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and was interviewed by Clocktower Radio Brooklyn. She was awarded artistic residencies in Korea 2014 and Iceland in 2015. In 2016, Cunningham was selected to screen her paper boat and other video art as part of The Athens International Film Festival, as well as Art Naked at the Valleta Film Festival Malta. Also in 2016, she took part of an art exhibition titled ‚ÄúThe Root of the New,‚Äù organized by Moscow curator Anya Dorofeeva. Cunningham created a large installation across a pond at Moscow State University's Apothecary Gardens, founded by Peter the Great in 1706. She also was part of a video exhibition Moscow's State Darwin Museum. In November 2016, she created a short film documenting the Water Protectors at Standing Rock, North Dakota where Cunningham's boats hung from barren trees as she held space with her husband, son-in-law actor Rhys Coiro and their family doctor, who provided medical care for the community. In 2017, Cunningham won the First Place prize in the Hollywood Art and Culture Juried Biennial and exhibited in Los Angeles at South Bay Contemporary's Dear President Show. Personal life In 1978, Cunningham met U.K.-born Peter Eves at the Spring Street Bar in New York City. She gave birth to their first daughter, Katherine, the following year in a small Little Italy apartment. Hours after Katherine's birth, the family appeared on Mulberry Street to bless their new daughter at the Feast of San Gennaro, seen in ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù Parts II and III. The young family led a gypsy-like existence, staying at an American millionaire's villa in Italy, crossing the heavily armed border to Yugoslavia at midnight, lodging with farmers in Cypress and hunting oysters on the Eastern seaboard. In 1984, Cunningham was hit by a cement truck. Her right leg was severed in the accident, but surgeons were able to reattach it, and after rehabilitation, she was able to walk again with a barely perceptible limp. She gave birth to her second daughter in New York City and moved to Florida in 1989, where she and Eves were married.

The plan was formulated to respond to the economic malaise caused by the Great Depression. The plan was largely written by the Dutch economists Hein Vos and Jan Tinbergen, the latter becoming the first laureate of the Nobel Prize in Economics.  History  When the Great Depression started to affect the Netherlands in 1931, the Dutch Government, consisting of confessional and liberal parties, responded with austerity, whilst maintaining the value of the Dutch guilder at the Gold standard. Although Dutch socialists had hailed the Great Depression as the start of the end of capitalism and thus believed it necessary to run its course, the SDAP would realise it was their constituency, the working class, who were most harshly affected by the Depression and the Government's policies. This change in policy towards the Depression came following the loss of two seats in the 1933 General Election to the extreme-left Stalinist CPH and Trotskyist RSP, which was blamed on the SDAP's inactive policy towards the Depression. Thus, at the SDAP Party Congress in 1934, a plan commission was established to provide a socialist response to the Depression.  The Plan  The Plan of Labour had two aims, firstly it sought to end economic stagnation and secondly, it sought to fundamentally change the economic system. To achieve the first, Vos and Tinbergen argued for the investment of 200 million guilders in public works, which would employ nearly 200,000 workers, thereby, relying on Keynesian economic idea of a multiplier, to increase working-class purchasing power and reinvigorate the Dutch economy. To achieve the second, the Plan of Labour envisaged a General Economic Council in which businesses, workers and the government could coordinate the economy through rationalization, industrialization and investment. Thus the Plan of Labour was the rejection of Marxist orthodoxy of passive opposition during the end crisis of capitalism, providing a template for the SDAP to seek government responsibility.  Aftermath  At the 1937 General Election, in which the SDAP campaigned with the slogan \\"Het moet, het kan! Op voor het Plan!\\" (Dutch: It's necessary, it's possible! For the Plan!), the SDAP and its progressive- Protestant ally the CDU won two seats from the extreme-left, reversing the defeat of 1933. However, with only 25 out of 100 seats, the centre-left did not enter government to implement the plan. Nevertheless, following the Second World War, the Labour Party (PvdA), the catch-all-successor of the SDAP and CDU, implemented large parts of the plan, most notably in the fields of agriculture and economic coordination, the latter with the establishment of the Social-Economic Council (SER), which was based on the aforementioned General Economic Council.

It has been based in the Borough of Ashford in Kent since 1947 and operates seven registered children's homes in Kent and Nottinghamshire as well the Caldecott Foundation School. The foundation's roots go back to 1911, when Leila Rendel founded a day nursery in the St Pancras district of London which catered to the children of women working in a nearby factory. It later evolved into a pioneering boarding school in Kent, first for working class children, and then for distressed and vulnerable children who had been placed into care. Rendel named the community after the children's book illustrator Randolph Caldecott whose pictures adorned the walls of the St Pancras nursery. The foundation was officially incorporated in 1946 as the Caldecott Community. Its name was changed to the Caldecott Foundation in 1997. History as the Caldecott Community The Caldecott Comminuty began its life in 1911 when Leila Rendel and her friend Phyllis Potter set up their own nursery school based on the progressive ideas of Margaret McMillan and Leila's aunt Edith Rendel who was an active critic of the English Poor Laws, a pioneer girls' club leader and a militant suffragist. Their school was located at Cartwright Gardens in St Pancras and mainly catered to the children of women working in a nearby matchbox factory. An admirer of Randolph Caldecott's children's book illustrations, Rendel named the nursery school in his honour and adorned its walls with a frieze of his pictures. Rendel's grandfather, Alexander Meadows Rendel, provided them with an endowment and further donations were received from her large circle of family and friends. By 1914 the school was well-established with a written constitution and Percy Nunn as its chairman. Princess Louise served as its president. Charlton Court in East Sutton, Caldecott's home from 1917 to 1924 The continued German bombing of London and subsequent condemnation of the St Pancras building by the local council in 1917 led the Caldecott Community to move with its teachers and children to Charlton Court, a large country house near Maidstone. In the process it became the first co-educational boarding school in the UK for working-class children. When the lease on Charlton Court expired in 1924, the school moved to another country house in Goffs Oak, a village in Hertfordshire and remained there for the next eight years. During its time there the community increasingly took in distressed and vulnerable children whose family lives had been disrupted by death, illness, and divorce. The school moved back to the Maidstone area in 1932 where it occupied Mote House. The World War II bombing of Maidstone led to the community moving to Hyde Heath in Dorset in 1941 where they remained for the duration of the war. Lord Lytton served as chairman of the school's trustees. During that period 100 boys and girls, including 15 Jewish refugees, were living in the community. They ranged in age from 1 to 16. At the time, only children up to the age of 11 were educated within the community itself. The older boys and girls went to local secondary schools. Over the years, ten Caldecott pupils were sent to Gordonstoun School on scholarships. Leila Rendel was a life-long friend of Kurt Hahn, Gordonstoun's founder, and was a founding trustee of the school. Mersham-le-Hatch in Mersham, Caldecott's home from 1947 to 2000 In 1947 the community moved to Mersham-le-Hatch, a large country house designed by Robert Adam surrounded by parkland. Located near Ashford in Kent, it had served as a military hospital during World War II. That same year with a grant from the Nuffield Trust, Rendel set up the first experimental reception centre in England to assess the most appropriate placement for children who had been taken into care. Mersham would remain Caldecott's home for over five decades. Its owner, Lord Brabourne became a long-time supporter of the community and served on its board of governors for over 40 years. Leila Rendel retired from active directorship of the community in 1967 and died two years later at the age of 86. James King succeeded her as the director and served in that post until his retirement in 1993. Like Rendel, he was awarded an OBE for his work with the community. During his tenure he reorganised the community's structure and set up smaller family units for the residential care of the children and young people in its care. Caldecott Foundation With the impending expiry of the lease on Mersham-le-Hatch in the late 1990s, the community's organization underwent further structural changes, and in 1997 changed its name to the Caldecott Foundation. An ¬£8m appeal was launched to fund the future accommodation and expansion of Caldecott. In 2002, the foundation's new headquarters were opened at Caldecott House, a large Victorian residence in Smeeth. Several residential homes were constructed on its grounds as well as a purpose-built school nearby which opened in 2003. The foundation launched another appeal in 2011, its centenary year. The appeal raised ¬£750,000 which was used to upgrade the foundation's supported accommodation and to set up two vocational training centers. As of 2018, the foundation's services include therapeutic residential care, emergency and assessment centers, vocational training and education both through tutoring and small classes in their residential care homes or at the Caldecott Foundation School, and fostering placement. The foundation is governed by an eight-member board of trustees whose chairman is Charles Lister OBE. Nick Barnett was appointed as Managing Director in March 2017. Caldecott Foundation School The Caldecott Foundation School is an independent special school located on Station Road in Ashford, Kent near the foundation's headquarters. It provides educational services and integrated therapy for children in the residential care of the foundation and delivers the National Curriculum for Key Stage 2 through Key Stage 4. The school has a sixth form and also provides vocational training in a number of areas. The vocational training includes an off-site training center for motor vehicle mechanics which is also open to pupils from other schools. As of 2017, 27 children and young people were enrolled in the school. The pupils range in age from 7 to 18 and are all eligible for pupil premium funding from the UK government. Many of them had been previously excluded from other care or educational settings because of their social, emotional and behavioural problems. According to the school's 2017 Ofsted inspection report, all pupils in the previous three years who left the school at the end of Year 11 or from the sixth form went on to further education, training or employment.

History The M1877 was first designed and produced by the Obukhov State Plant in Saint Petersburg and was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns with similar roles such as the Mortier de 220 mm mod√®le 1880 or Mortaio da 210/8 D.S. Design The M1877 was a short barreled breech-loading mortar. The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with reinforcing hoops which was built from cast iron and steel. The mortar had an early form of Krupp horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. There were also two other similar and mortars that were also designed in 1877. =Coastal Defense= In the coastal defense role, the M1877's theory of operation was that a low-velocity mortar firing a large shell at a high-angle was more likely to destroy an enemy ship by penetrating its thin deck armor than a high-velocity low-angle naval gun attempting to penetrate its thicker belt armor. The downside was that high-angle indirect fire was harder to aim correctly so more mortars would be needed to defend an area from attack. However, if the area was constrained by geography like a port at the mouth of a river the navigation channels could be measured ahead of time and firing ranges calculated. A complicating factor was as naval artillery progressed their size and range soon eclipsed the mortar's range. In the coastal defense role, the M1877 was mounted on a garrison mount which sat on a concrete slab behind a parapet. The mount consisted of a rectangular steel firing platform with a pivot at the front and two wheels at the rear to give 360¬∞ of traverse. The recoil system for the M1877 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffers under the front slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. These garrison mounts were used in both the coastal defense and fortress gun roles. =Fortress Gun= In addition to its coastal defense role, the M1877 was also used as a fortress gun. The theory of operation was that a heavy mortar would be useful to defend forts because its large shell and high angle fire could destroy an enemies assault trenches during siege operations. The heavy shell and high angle fire would also be useful for counter-battery fire against enemy siege artillery. =Siege Gun= Another role for the M1877 was as a siege gun. The M1877 was designed with the lessons of the Franco-Prussian and Russo-Turkish war in mind where field guns with smaller shells and limited elevation had difficulty overcoming fortifications. What was needed was a mortar capable of high-angle fire which could fire a large shell to drop inside the walls of enemy fortifications to destroy enemy gun emplacements, command posts and magazines. In the siege gun role, the gun cradle could be removed from its garrison mount and an axle with two wooden spoked wheels could be attached to the front. The rear of the cradle could then be hooked up to a limber so the mortar could be towed by a horse team or artillery tractor. To facilitate towing on soft ground the wheels were often fitted with Bonagente grousers patented by the Italian major Crispino Bonagente. These consisted of twelve rectangular plates connected with elastic links and are visible in many photographs of World War I artillery from all of the combatants. Once on site, the axle could be removed and a set of small wheels could be fit to the front of the cradle. A piece of ground could then be leveled and a wooden firing platform assembled and the mortar placed on the firing platform. The firing platform had an external recoil mechanism which connected to a steel eye on the firing platform and a hook on the gun cradle between the wheels. Lastly, a set of wooden ramps were placed behind the wheels and when the gun fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and was returned to position by a combination of the buffers and gravity. However, there was no traversing mechanism and the gun had to be levered into position to aim. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire. Due to the weight of the mortar it may have not been used in the siege role very often.

Personal life Gie was born in Zurich, Switzerland, on 22 March 1727. He was one of the children of Andreas Caspar Gie and Anne Marie Liguren. He died 1 July 1797 in Cape Town. He arrived on 23 January 1751 on the ship Rosenburg, from Texel, the Netherlands. as a young man working in the military. He was married on 18 December 1757 to Engela Johanna Leij. They had six children. His working life started in the military. In 1761 he became a general merchant and later a supplier of goods. He supplied ships with goods at the refreshment station in Cape Town harbour on their way to India or Europe. He had a special licence for that. While busy with his merchant supply activities he became the Orphan- Master of the Cape Colony in 1768. The function of the Orphan-Chamber was to look after the interest of orphans. Later in the same year he was appointed the Civil Commissioner in Matrimonial Affairs at the Matrimonial Court. The function of the Court was to establish whether couples who wanted to marry were eligible. The Court consisted of a president and six members. This court was abolished by Sir David Baird in 1806, long after Gie's death. In 1779 he added the task of Commissioner of Fleet Affairs. These fleet affairs dealt with the management of the fleet of ships, especially regarding logistics and docking. The Dutch East India Company had a political council that governed the Cape Colony. This political council supervised the regulations of the Lords Seventeen (Dutch: Heren XVII). The Political Council appointed three citizens to attend meetings where normal citizens were involved. Those three people were called the Citizen Council. In 1784 Gie was appointed to the Council. In 1786, his request that the number of the Citizen Council be expanded to six was granted. He was appointed to the rank of captain in the civil society. In 1793, the Cape Colony was divided into wards. Gie became master of one of the wards. Freemasoryn Together with A. Chiron (first Grand Master), J. A. le Febre, P. Soermans, Christoffel Brand, J. A. van Schoor, Olof de Wet, and P. J. de Wit, Gie started the first Freemason Lodge in South Africa. It was called Lodge de Goede Hoop. In 1776, he was appointed Grand Master but, due to his inability to speak English, he had to step down. Being Swiss, however, he was fluent in German and French.

At the question round, Reaidy was asked by composer Guy Manoukian what makes her different from other candidates. She replied: What sets me apart from other candidates is that I am a diplomatic person. I try to understand people instead of criticizing. This sets me apart especially in today's society. In the top 5, Reaidy was asked what was her biggest failure in life. She answered that failure was a necessary step in life in order to succeed. The judging panel consisted of TV host George Kurdahi, singer Nancy Ajram, Miss Lebanon 2004 Nadine Nassib Njeim, actor Adel Karam, designer Nicolas Jebran, composer Guy Manoukian and Miss Universe 2017 Demi- Leigh Nel-Peters, among others.

It was built in 1935. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  Ingham's first post office, circa 1880 Ingham is located on the Bruce Highway approximately 116 km north of Townsville. It is within the Herbert River region which was explored in February 1864 by George Dalrymple and Arthur Scott, with the first settlers arriving in 1869 to take up sugar, cotton and coffee growing. Postal services were established there in 1871, with the first post office and residence being constructed in 1875. Two mail routes were operating in 1873 - the steamer mail run from Cardwell and a fortnightly mail service by horse between Townsville and Ingham, a distance of 95 miles (150 km). As settlers moved into the area and plantations developed, a post office site was established on a 624-acre reserve. The building was erected in 1875, run by postmistress Mrs Collins, at a salary of per annum. Mail was transported overland from the river steamer over a distance of four miles (6.5 km). In 1879, the postmaster became responsible for the telegraph station. The township of Lower Herbert was officially named Ingham in 1882 and the telegraph line was extended to the coast at Dungeness in November 1883. After this mail, telegraph and telephone services developed. By 1908, a trunk line telephone exchange was established, followed by the installation of a magneto type manual exchange. By 1910, eight sugar plantations and six mills had been established in the Ingham area, with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) prominent. By 1931, the population of the Hinchinbrook Shire was approximately 8500, and the sugar industry was still expanding. Around this time, in 1935, the current post office was built on the site of the previous timber building,Warmington and Ward and it is possible that a section of the earlier 1870s structure remains at the rear of the existing building, but this has not been confirmed. After World War II, the area's sugar cane industry underwent another two expansionist phases, first between 1951 and 1953 and later after 1963. During this time (in 1957) it appears that a new wing and L-shaped verandah was added to the east side of the 1930s post office building.  Description  Ingham Post Office is at 15 Lannercost Street, Ingham, near the intersection with the Bruce Highway, the main thoroughfare through town. It comprisied the whole of Lot 1 RP735048. The building is freestanding with a landscaped street frontage, and flanked on the east by a five-level redbrick office-bank building and on the west by the smaller Commonwealth Bank. The site is flat and incorporates a large bitumen area at the rear for carparking. A steel-framed telecommunications tower is in the south-west corner behind the exchange building which faces the highway. A gravel driveway along the post office's west boundary provides access to a loading dock built at the rear of the building. Buildings in the general vicinity are disparate in form, age and size, although the post office shares a civic precinct with the Hinchinbrook Shire Chambers and Library nearby. It also fronts a landscaped median strip, running the length of Lannercost Street and incorporates plants, recreational furniture and the town's war memorial clock. Ingham Post Office is asymmetrical in plan form but comprises twin corner porches which flank a main front gable. The roof is lined with galvanised corrugated iron, the main ridge parallel to the street, and a central wing projecting forward at right angles. The side wings are drawn out into five and four bays length on the east and west sides respectively with the former, which is not original and constructed after 1957, set at a higher pitch. The verandah colonnade is given a solid treatment set out by square set columns with vaguely \\"Tuscan\\" capitals which support a much lighter fascia below the low pitched roof. A metal balustrade runs between the columns, and down over the concrete entry steps either side of the central wing. The post office's dual entry is emphasised by two small enclosures projecting either side of the central breakfront, each containing a slit window. The main window front is stepped forward on a rendered base with three central windows separated by four large brackets with volutes, which hold up the formerly shingled sunhood. Over this, the dentilled broken pediment is just as weighty and reinforces the general air of eighteenth-century Colonial Revival expression. The rear of the building is clad with timber weatherboards and where various steel-framed service additions have been added. Elsewhere around the building perimeter, timber steps, balustrades, louvred sunscreens and a disabled ramp have been added. Entry to the central retail shop is via the original side porches and steps. Directly beyond this, running in an east‚Äìwest direction is a double loaded corridor, with access to administrative and staff areas on the west including an interview room, office, store rooms, lunchroom, plant and male toilets. To the south, a centrally-positioned passage leads down a few steps to the female toilets, contractors' room and lockers. This section of the building, constructed in reverse hardwood frame has vertical board linings and ceilings and panelled doors, and may correspond to the original 1875 post office. The entire east wing and verandah appears to be an addition built after 1957 and comprises the open mail sorting room and post office box wall; further south, the construction of the service area and loading dock has internalised the former weatherboard exterior. Key elements of the building include: * free standing form * original composition of a central breakfront gable to Lannercost Street flanked by corner side porches with integrally designed steps and building entries * smooth rendered finish and mouldings including the porch columns, capitals moulded string lines and circular gable vents; and *wrought iron patterned screens and balustrade to the subfloor areas = Condition = The original planning of Ingham Post Office comprised twin porches either side of a central breakfronted postal hall. The planning arrangement is assumed to have provided a dual but independent operation of the postal and telegraphic functions. Details of the original internal planning arrangement are not known and further obscured by the subsequent removal and/or concealment of fabric, as well as the additions to the building on the south and east sides. This includes the enlargement and refurbishment of the post shop, the addition of the loading dock, and the extended mailroom wing and verandah. Photographic evidence indicates the east porch was one bay wide and two deep, behind which the transverse gable (located at a lower ridge height that the one currently) included a separate side entry and steps and windows protected by a shingled sunhood. The rear timber reverse-framed section may be associated with the 1875 building. Gvien the changed pattern of use, the building's original design is limited to the street frontage, specifically the projecting north and west gables, west porch and entry, smooth rendered finish and mouldings, and the east verandah and entry to the extent of the first bay. The extended east wing and south service additions demonstrate the ongoing use of the site but have altered/concealed much of the original interior fabric and detailing. That which remains is generally associated with the assumed 1875 section at the rear and is of conventional construction - timber panelling, timber-panelled doors and the like. Changes associated with the enlargement of the Australia Post retail shop including the installation of shelving which conceals the front window wall and suspended acoustic tile ceilings which disrupt the general sense of enclosure. Externally, the multi-colour paint scheme appears to be non- original and a number of original openings have been infilled. = Original fabric = The original fabric of the building included: * Structural frame: Generally, loadbearing masonry construction on brick piers with timber floor and roof framing. * External walls: Hard render perimeter walls with a moulded string line at the ground floor level. Window openings have multipane double hung sash windows with projecting sills. Verandah piers have moulded capitals and bases. The front gable has a dentilled broken pediment, below which is a bracketed sunhood across the trio of front windows. The gables to the north and west elevations have central circular vents with louvres, moulded surrounds and keystones. The rear walls (south) are timber-framed with weatherboards. * Internal walls: Generally hard rendered perimeter walls with internal partitions being either concealed or removed. Elsewhere timber-framed partitions have been constructed, lined with asbestos or plasterboard, with no architraves and vinyl skirting. The rear timber framed section of the building (which may incorporate the original 1875 structure) has vertical board wall linings on a reverse hardwood frame and timber panel doors. The east mail sorting room addition uses steel? structural columns and aluminium-framed highlight glazing. * Floor: Timber boarded floors generally with moulded timber skirting boards, subsequently lined with carpet and vinyl. The east porch has timber flooring supported on steel bearers (this structure is likely to be associated with the mailroom extension). Later rear south additions have concrete slab floors. The entry steps to the side porches are concrete with metal balustrades. * Ceiling: Generally concealed by suspended acoustic tiles or plasterboard associated with the east extension of the mailroom. Timber boarded ceilings are intact in the rear (south) section (which may incorporate the original 1875 structure). * Roof: Hipped roof is timber-framed originally lined with corrugated material (possibly asbestos) and subsequently relined with galvanised corrugated iron. Generally, fascias are painted timber with boxed eaves and new roof rainwater goods. The rear timber section has exposed rafters and a timber slatted eave soffit. * Front building inscription \\"INGHAM POST OFFICE\\" is in red lettering. * The front sunhood has a metal sheet shingle roof and is supported by four oversized painted cast cement brackets. * Timber slats enclose the subfloor along the rear wall. * Decorative metal grilles to sub floor vents. = Timeline of the building = 1875: First post office opened. 1895: Application made for a subdivision for a School of Arts reserve from the Post and Telegraph site. 1935: The post office constructed with the retention of elements of the 1875 timber post office at the rear. 1957: Construction of neighbouring Commonwealth Bank. It is likely that during this time the east wing mailroom addition was constructed and telegraph facilities relocated to the new Ingham Exchange built in the same year. The works involved the removal of the original sunhood, windows, door and timber steps in the former east elevation. The new roof appears to have been constructed at a higher pitch but general detailing associated with the original gable, verandah and piers is matched. c.1995: Addition of steel- framed skillion structure at the rear (south) lined with fibre cement weatherboards on a concrete slab. The area provided storage for bikes, a forklift and a loading dock accessible to the mailroom. c.1995: Refurbishment of the postal retail area with standard Australia Post livery.  Heritage listing  The significant components of Ingham Post Office include the main original 1935 building component. The heritage listing does not incorporate the later post-1957 east wing, the timber and metal-framed non-original additions to the rear of the building, the brick exchange buildings located to the rear of the property, nor the tall steel-framed telecommunications tower. Ingham Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Ingham Post Office was constructed in 1935 to a design by the Commonwealth Department of the Interior under Horace Mackennal. It is one of many small to medium-sized single-storey post offices designed and built throughout Queensland during the interwar period to service its towns and regional centres; it was also expanded in the 1950s when the area's sugar cane industry underwent an expansionist phase. The post office was built on the site of the former 1875 post and telegraph office, and sections of the earlier timber- framed structure may be retained on the south side of the building. The post office, with the original 1935 component still discernible and largely intact externally, is also a component of the civic and commercial precinct of Ingham, sharing this with the nearby Hinchinbrook Shire Chambers and Library; these aspects of the building enhance the historical value. Criterion D: Characteristic values Ingham Post Office is an example of: * a retail post office typology (third generation 1930-1974) * an interwar c.1915-1942 in the Neo-Georgian style (Colonial Revival) * the work of Commonwealth Department of the Interior under Horace Mackennal) Typologically, Ingham Post Office, built in 1935, is an example of a third generation retail post office. This generation of typologies demonstrate an emergent retail function in postal operations, separation of the telephone exchange area and increased requirements for larger post office box lobby areas with independent access and serviced by a frontally positioned mail sorting room and/or a rear loading yard. These aspects are evident in the original design to the extent it comprised a symmetrically composed twin porch arrangement, with a central breakfront postal hall to Lannercost Street. Subsequent extensions to the building, including the later east wing, have altered the original plan and form and therefore impacted on this aspect of the original typology, albeit they have generally reinforced the primacy of the private box function and enlarged mailroom facility. In the state context, and with regard to post offices still owned and operated by Australia Post, Ingham Post Office is one of three \\"Type M6 1930s Twin Porch\\" built in the period 1935‚Äì38 with similar characteristics.Queensland University 1983 Report As with the Bowen Post Office and the Ayr Post Office, Ingham Post Office demonstrates the basic composition of a symmetrical expanded porch (at least externally) but is considered the most altered of the three. Stylistically, the building's pedimented gable front is conservative, particularly by Government architecture standards of the time, but arguably of interest as one of the last generally Colonial-Revival post offices in Australia (albeit altered). The detail is heavy but perhaps intentionally so to give added municipal presence on a wayside frontage that is also the main thoroughfare through town. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Ingham Post Office has some aesthetic qualities in the immediate context, deriving from the prominent and original pedimented gabled frontage to Lannercost Street, and enhanced by the Colonial-flavoured verandahs and porch entries.

As a member of the Military Legal Corps, during Franco's regime he became civil government of several provinces, national representative of Trade Unions and the Secretary General of the FET y de las JONS party, a primary component of the ‚ÄúNational movement\\". As such, he had a prominent role in the regime's policies during their developmental stage. Among the adopted measures was the enactment of the National Movement Principles Act, one of the regime's fundamental laws. An easy-going and jovial person, he quickly became one of the most popular figures of the dictatorship and was known as ‚Äúthe smile of the regime‚Äù.  Biography  = Youth and Training = He was born on 27 September 1913 in the town of Cabra in Cordoba, into a family of small agricultural land owners in Andalusia.Amaya Quer, √Älex (2012). ¬´Resumen de \\"Unidad, totalidad y jerarqu√≠a\\": continuidades y rupturas en la teor√≠a y la praxis de la organizaci√≥n sindical espa√±ola, 1939-1969¬ª. Historia y Pol√≠tica (Madrid: Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia y Centro de Estudios Pol√≠ticos y Constitucionales) (28): 305-331. ISSN 1575-0361. He was the son of Felipe Sol√≠s Villechenous - the Mayor of Cabra during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera - and Eduarda Ruiz Luna. He studied law at the University of Deusto and the University of Valladolid. As part of the \\"old guard\\" of the Falange Espa√±ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista(FE de las JONS), he came to take part in the Civil War in support of the Nationalists. During the conflict he would reach the rank of provisional alf√©rez. At the end of dispute, he joined the opposition Technical Trade Union Ministry, where he held the seat of Secretary of the National Metalworkers' Trade Union, a part of the national trade union center. He was part of the Military Legal Corps, which he entered through opposition. As such, in 1941 he acted as prosecutor in the trial against a group of anarchist members of the Maquis, whom Sol√≠s accused of sabotage and of wanting to restore the Republic. They would finally be sentenced to death and executed. In 1944 he was enlisted as secretary to the General Vice-Secretary of Social Ordinance, a body in charge of trade union issues, among others. Although technically an ‚Äúold guard‚Äù of the Falange Espa√±ola, Sol√≠s spent much of his professional career as an Army legal officer and as a union steward, so he had little contact with the original fascist movement. = Role in the Unions = In 1946, he was appointed as a representative to the Cortes Espa√±olas, a position he held for almost all the years of the dictatorship until December 1975. During 1946, as part of his job as the Vice-secretary General of Social Ordinance, he organised the first Trade Union elections and also the first National Congress of Workers. Later he served as Civil Governor of the provinces of Pontevedra and Guip√∫zcoa. Sol√≠s pictured with Franco in 1950. In 1951, he was appointed national Trade Union representative, replacing Ferm√≠n Sanz-Comoro, who has resigned after the Barcelona tram strike of the same year. A jovial, polite and easy-going person, Sol√≠s soon became one of the most popular leaders of the regime and would become known as the ‚Äúsmile of the regime‚Äù. During the following years he maintained a great presence in Spanish public and political life. It should be taken into account that his time as national trade union representative also coincided with the Spanish economic boom of the 1960s, known as the Spanish miracle. Under Sol√≠s, the labor institutions achieved maximum impact; he contributed to both expanding and modernizing them.The union work ‚ÄúEducacion y Descanso‚Äù (EyD) became one of the most popular instruments of trade unions among the working class, owing either to its network of recreational facilities or to its wide range of cultural activities. Before the rise of the ‚Äútechnocrats‚Äù within the government and the administration, the Falange Espa√±ola party were \\"entrenched‚Äù in the Trade Union Organization, promoting a kind of ‚Äúopenness‚Äùfrom the organization towards workers until this advocacy group became the core of Francoism. For example, after 1954 it was no longer necessary to possess a FET y de las JONS card in order to be able to participate in the trade union elections and even was even an attempt from the Francoist apparatus to attract former anarcho-syndicalist leaders to its core/bosom. Through this openness, Sol√≠s also sought to obtain the approval of the International Labour Organization (ILO). This process culminated in the 1966 union elections of ‚Äúliaisons‚Äù and ‚Äújurors‚Äù who enjoyed relative freedom. But these elections did not reinforce the nationalist position, but quite the opposite, as Left-wing opposition were elected to many of the posts through the clandestine movement of the ‚Äúworkers‚Äô commissions\\". By 1967-1968, the liberalizing experiment could not be terminated. In fact Sol√≠s had no objection to supporting the repression of the workers‚Äô commissions during the state of emergency period decreed in 1968. = Secretary General of the Movement = Sol√≠s in April 1962 delivering a speech on occasion of the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Cabildo of Gran Canaria. In February 1957, he was appointed Secretary-General of the \\"Movement\\"; a position that he would juggle with his role as the national trade union representative for more than a decade. He was known for being the least dogmatic member of the Falangist sector. Sol√≠s embarked on the task of modernizing the ‚Äúmovement\\".Within the party he collaborated closely with Fernando Herrero Tejedor, who was the Deputy Secretary General of the Movement during the 1960s. His appointment as chief of the FET y de las JONS came shortly after the so-called ‚ÄúCrisis of February 1956‚Äù. Sol√≠s encountered an antiquated party, a victim of the separation between the generation that made the civil war and the younger generations. In a short time, he drew up the draft law of principles of the national movement, which sought to provide a legal basis for the single party of the regime and would end up being approved in 1958. However, some historians have considered that this law actually meant the beginning of the end of the FET y de las JONS as a party, diluting the nationalism within the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù. Sol√≠s tried to assemble a nationalist project of an alternative regime to that of the Opus Dei technocrats. This project, which had already been partially employed in Labour Unions through an internal opening, was complemented by the creation of ‚Äúassociations‚Äù within the movement to equip the Franco regime with a certain level of popular participation in the so- called contrast of views. By October 1958 Sol√≠s had already created the National Delegation of Associations with the mission of ‚Äúwidening the bases of accession to the movement to collective groups‚Äù and to whose front he had appointed Manuel Fraga Iribarne. As Minister-Secretary General of the Movement, it was essential that the institutions of the Franco regime adapt to the social changes that were occurring in Spain, promoting a ‚Äúpolitical development‚Äù that complements economic growth. However, his association bill - which was already drawn up at the end of 1964 - was parked by the unmoving opposition of the Opus Dei technocrats, the undersecretary of President Luis Carrero Blanco and also by General Franco himself, with the fear that the ‚Äúassociations‚Äù could cause the reappearance of political parties. Sol√≠s continued to battle in this regard, and in the middle of 1969 he promoted a preliminary draft of the bases of the right of association, although again Franco did not want to promulgate it. The great power that Sol√≠s held - single party, unions, \\"movement\\" press and radio - earned him the suspicions of many leaders in the regime. During these years, his work at the forefront of the single party was not without criticism from the most extreme sectors of Francoism, which accused Sol√≠s of keeping the party in a state of ‚Äútotal abandonment‚Äù. He was also highly criticized for his management of the \\"movement\\" press, the set of newspapers and publications controlled by the regime. The ‚Äúold guard‚Äù Jos√© Antonio Gir√≥n de Velasco came to say that Sol√≠s used the newspaper Pueblo, which in theory was the newspaper of the labour trade unions, as a means of communication in his personal service. However, Sol√≠s's main enemy among the Francoist hierarchy was Vice President Carrero Blanco. During the second half of the 1960s, Sol√≠s fought to expand the political and economic competencies of the trade union organization. He also tried to promote the expansion of rights among the employees within enterprises,not within unions, an idea was viscerally rejected by entrepreneurs and some sectors of the government (particularly by Carrero Blanco). The matter of Franco's succession was another issue. With the appointment of Juan Carlos de Borb√≥n as Franco's successor,Solis led a faction of the nationalist movement that preferred a dictator to a regency with no expiration date . Those in favor of regency, led by Jos√© Sol√≠s, intended to delay the return of the monarchy, but did not achieve its objective. In October 1969, he was ousted from office. His downfall occurred in the context of the ‚ÄúMatesa scandal\\". In a movement that sought to discredit the technocrats of Opus Dei, the \\"movement\\"‚Äôs press (with the support of Ministers Manuel Fraga and Jos√© Sol√≠s) made a case of corruption, involving a businessman related to the Catholic institution, public. After the outbreak of the scandal there was a change of government. Paradoxically, Sol√≠s and Fraga were among the ministers who were fired. Opus Dei were reinforced by accepting the frank demands of Carrero Blanco in favour of a ‚Äúunited government without wear‚Äù, which led to the so-called ‚Äúone-party government‚Äù. According to Bartolom√© Bennassar, Sol√≠s was taken aback by his dismissal, as he believed he would have Franco's reassurances that he would remain in the cabinet. After this event, the importance of the Spanish trade union organization within the Government was diminished. = Return to Government = From June 1975, he once again occupied the position of Secretary General of the Movement in Franco's final government, after the accidental death of his predecessor Fernando Herrero Tejedor. However, by this time Sol√≠s had already left behind his previous liberal proposals. In October 1975 he was a prominent participant in the Sahara Crisis. With Franco seriously ill, on October 21 Sol√≠s travelled to Morocco to meet King Hassan II, to try and negotiate an exit and avoid direct conflict between the two countries. They would end up signing the Madrid Accords by which Spain left the territories of the Spanish Sahara, which were to be occupied by Morocco and Mauritania. He formed part of the first government after the death of Franco as Minister of Labour, a position he held from 11 December 1975 to 7 July 1946. Some authors have suggested that this appointment was partially in recognition of his previous participation in the negotiations with Morocco. However, the labour situation Sol√≠s found was very complicated. The Spanish economy had weakened significantly due to the effects of the oil crisis of 1973. During the first months of 1976, the opposition's trade union forces embarked on an important campaign of mobilizations and strikes, with a total of 17,731 strikes. In this context, the Vitoria massacre occurred, during which several workers were killed by police repression. Sol√≠s retired from his post following the end of the Arias government in July 1976. He has since abandoned political life to focus on business activity. He died at his home in Madrid on 20 May 1990 and was buried in his hometown.  Personal life  He married Ana Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez Sedano- Bosch, with whom he had fourteen children. Sol√≠s collaborated with his friend Colonel Enrique Herrera Mar√≠n - Spain's military attach√© in Buenos Aires - on the steps of the transfer of exiled Argentine President Juan Domingo Per√≥n. In 1961 Per√≥n finally settled on Spanish soil with the assistance of the Francoist government. During the years of dictatorship, Sol√≠s became president of the International Committee for the Defense of Christian Civilization.  Works  * ‚Äî‚Äî (1955). Nuestro sindicalismo.

It was intended to fill an intermediate trainer role, but offered no advance on existing aircraft and only the prototype was completed. Design and development In about 1932 the Institute of Gliding Technique (I.T.S.) released a specification for an intermediate glider which resulted in the ITS- II. Michal Blaicher was a glider pioneer in Poland who later was in charge of the Military Gliding Camp (W.O.S.) at Ustianowa. His 1933 design was aimed at the same intermediate class but intended to have better performance than the 1933 Kocjan Komar, which had displaced the ITS-II. It was built in the Lw√≥w workshops of ZASPL, the Aviation Association of students of the Technical University and the oldest aviation organization in Poland, which had also built the ITS-II. The Blaicher B.1's first flight was on 29 March 1934, piloted by its designer. Tests at Ustianowa, flown by Edward Peterek, showed no significant improvement over the Komar so no production resulted, though the sole prototype remained operational for two more years. The Blaicher B.1 had a two part, twin spar wing of rectangular plan out to angular tips. It was plywood-covered from the forward spar around the leading edge, forming a D-box. Behind, the wing was fabric covered. It was mounted centrally on a raised, streamlined pedestal which extended aft of the wing, dropping in height, to the tail. Two pairs of parallel struts braced the wing to the lower fuselage. The pilot's open cockpit was immediately ahead of the pedestal and wing leading edge. The fuselage was hexagonal in section, though dominated by deep, vertical sides and covered with ply forward and fabric aft. A sprung landing skid ran from the nose almost to the trailing edge, aided by a short tailskid. At the rear a triangular tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage and braced from below with a single strut on each side, carried straight- edged, round tipped elevators with a central cut-out for rudder movement. The fin was very small but mounted a full, rounded and balanced rudder.

The technique was not fully exploited until the 1960s, when June Almeida used it to identify viruses including rubella virus and the 1970s when Albert Kapikian discovered noroviruses using the method.  Principle  Viruses are suspended, usually in phosphate buffered saline, and antiserum is added. The mixture is warmed, usually to 37¬∞C, centrifuged at 10,000g for a few minutes and the resultant pellet examined by negative stain electron microscopy. Any aggregated virus particles can be identified if the specificity of the antisera is known.Lavazza A, Tittarelli C, Cerioli M.

In the late 1990s, she became known for her video work, working mostly with children. Her recent works include \\"Thought\\" an alter ego character who can infiltrate the mind and replace thoughts. Based on meditation, this is a multimedia work which includes video, photography painting and sculpture. Biography Maria Marshall was born in Bombay. Today, she lives and works in Berlin. A dual Swiss and British citizen, she holds a degree in sculpture from the Wimbledon College of Arts in London. She has also studied at the Chelsea College of Arts in London and the Geneva School of Fine Arts. Work =Art= The general atmosphere of her films is dreamlike and agonizing. She takes on moral and psychological issues, using digital illusions and creates pieces that, projected as installations, are striking for the spectator's mind. The intention, she says, is not to shock, but to provoke the viewer through a seductive image, to ask themselves what makes them feel uncomfortable. Her films often revolve around the world of childhood, projecting adult concerns. She stages them in situations that make the adult viewer uncomfortable. Innocence itself becomes ambiguous. It perverts these \\"taboo\\" subjects, childhood, innocence, oscillating between good and evil, between sacred and profane. Children or adolescents are always threatened, confronted with evil, alone in the face of danger. This reflects the anguish of a mother for her children. Her videos, she says, include her paranoia as a mother 2,3,4. These works continue to be shown internationally, including at the National Museum of Women in the Arts. With the spread of the Internet and increased freedom of speech in the US, her work has been appropriated by fake news Trolls who use the work to sensationalize their YouTube videos. Marshall has recently created an Alter Ego superhero character \\"Thought\\" she uses to investigate. Her emotionally charged films eradicate war, by erasing thought, silencing \\"Thought\\", investigating meditative spaces, such as the Everest series. \\"Thought\\" dances at a Mount Everest base camp‚Äîa freedom dance, Sufi whirling all around the world and painting the noise around the mind as in Stille and Flak shown at Art Loft Berlin, Werkhalle Wiesenburg, Berlin. In Hair Sweet Hair, a site specific exhibition on the implication of hair on \\"Thought\\" includes paintings, sculptures and photography. The roles in her films are mostly played by her own children, which adds an emotional density and intensity to the work. There is precision in the execution of the work‚Äîthe mediums, light source and framing. Marshall uses techniques such as loops, zooms and slow motion, to amplify the anxiety and the obsessive side of her films. The titles of her works, for example: When I Grow Up, I Want To Be A Cooker, are sentences spoken by her children. The sound is often limited to a child's voice that repeats a looping phrase, such as \\"I Love You Mummy, I Hate You\\", or a haunting, amplified sound, such as in Playground, the sound of the missing ball on the wall of the chapel. Marshall also uses the potency of silence. The aesthetics of her works can refer to ancient painting, such as Caravaggio's The Madonna with the Snake. In the case of I Should Be Older Than All of You a box showing a young boy lying, motionless and very calm, is surrounded by snakes. The rigorous composition of the framing is in itself a reference to Baroque painting. This forms a link to Western imagery and consequently makes the films more disturbing. =Selected videos= When I Grow Up I Want To Be A Cooker, (1998). A two-year-old child is seen inhaling a cigarette, and blowing out perfect smoke rings. I Saw You Crying. A teenager laughs in slow motion in front of a billowing yellow curtain. He raises a gun and shoots towards the camera. The curtain turns red, as the boy cries. Trout. A child pedals forward on a tricycle with a sign that says \\"Love Me\\". As he cycles forwards through the public they walk backwards. Cyclops. Video installation. Two videos projected together in a corner. A woman in underwear is on one screen, a child in a vest on the other. The camera revolves around them like a predator in their cold rooms. The woman is lit in a sequence of disturbing lights. There seems to be a longing from one screen to the other to dispel the separation. The sound is recorded from the camera, an ominous sound that matches the movement. The motion control rig is called \\"Cyclops\\" the film is consequently titled Cyclops. Playground. A teenager plays football in slow motion against a church. The ball is removed, but the shadow continues to play. The sound of the ball hitting the wall and the boy's effort is amplified, making it resonate. The boy kicks the ball around the Church like an object. This work is anti establishment. Don¬¥t let the T Rex Get The Children. The video begins with a close-up of a child's face. They lick the screen and then smile. As the camera reveals the child's face in incongruous rapturous laughter, the viewer, first discovers his shaved head and then a bright green straight jacket and a velvet padded cell. These discordant elements are disturbing as they play with our suspension of disbelief. I Should Be Older Than All Of You, (2000). Using a motion control camera filming the rib cage of a child breathing, it pulls out in slow motion to reveal a child lying still in a box of red and orange silks. With the precision of a Donald Judd structure and Rothko tones. As the camera shows the whole image, slithering in the gold silk edge are snakes, reminiscent of a baroque frame. The snakes slither towards the child who is unperturbed. When are we there?, (2001). The viewer walks up a marble staircase, along a paneled corridor and into a room where a woman stands unflinching. The viewer examines the woman and with the gaze appears indentations on the skin, movements, as if it was invisibly touched by the viewer's gaze.{ I Love You Mummy - I Hate You. A hammock, containing two little boys, rocks. One says \\"√ç love you Mummy\\", the other says¬¥\\"I hate you\\". As the hammock repeatedly rocks rhythmically to the voice, the hammock is presented without the boys. Initiating a sense of loss. Dance for freedom- Thought. Marshall's alter ego Sufi whirls all around the world. I can see the wood for the trees. Positioned on two opposite screens one shows a tank shooting across the space at \\"Thought\\" holding a crying baby. A paintbrush appears in \\"Thought\\"'s hand and she makes paint strokes that are simulated on the opposite screen eradicating the tank from the image with the brush strokes. =Solo exhibitions= 1998, Team Gallery, New York 1999, Team Gallery, New York - Real Art Ways, Harford, Connecticut 2000, Galerie Vaclava Spaly, Prague - Yves St Laurent, Paris - Oliver Art Center, CCAC Institute, Oakland; San Francisco, Larry Rinder - Gallery 400, University of Illinois, Chicago 2001, Freiburger Kunstverein, Freiburg - Team Gallery, New York 2002, Fonds R√©gional d'Art Contemporain, Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur - Palais de Tokyo, Paris - screening/talk, Centre Pompidou, Christine Macel - Team Gallery, New York - Project Space, The Swiss Institute, New York - Site Gallery, Sheffield - G√∂teborgs Konsthall, G√∂teborg 2003, Salon 94, New York, Jeannie Greenberg Vandoren-Rohatn - Ruth and Bill True collection, Western Bridge, Seattle 2004, Cry Pig, Team Gallery, New York - Centre pour l'image Contemporaine, Gen√®ve. 2006, Playground, Mus√©e Dauphinois, Grenoble - Three Works, Herzliya Museum, Israel 2009, Artist spotlight.New Frontiers, Sundance Film Festival 2011, Tank TV, London 2012, In my End is my beginning, site specific installation 2014, Mac's Museum Grand-Hornu, Belgium, curator Laurent Busine 2016, Kaus Australis, Rotterdam 2017, Grace, site specific, curator Nadja Romain, Werkhalle Wiesenburg, Berlin.

Beginning as a Volunteer unit formed from teetotallers in the city of Edinburgh in 1867, it later became affiliated to the Royal Scots. During World War I it served in the Senussi Campaign and on the Western Front. Postwar it was converted into a medium artillery battery. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. The 1st City of Edinburgh RVC comprised 21 different companies raised in that city between August 1859 and November 1860 drawn from miscellaneous interests. No 16 Company was formed on 29 February 1860 by John Hope entirely from members of the British Temperance League who had 'signed the pledge' as Total abstainers. Hope then decided to raise a complete corps of abstainers from Edinburgh and on 27 May 1867 the 3rd City of Edinburgh RVC of two companies was formed with Hope in command. Most of his recruits (and the cap badge) were taken from No 16 Company, and the 3rd RVC remained administratively attached to the 1st City of Edinburgh RVC (the Queen's Edinburgh Volunteer Rifle Brigade) for several years. The unit, known locally as 'John Hope's Water Rats', added new companies in 1868,1872 and 1877, reaching a total of six companies. In 1880 it was renumbered as the 2nd Edinburgh RVC. From 1861 to 1892 the British Temperance League Cadet Corps of four companies with John Hope in command was affiliated to the unit.Beckett, pp. 59‚Äì60.Beckett, Appendix VII.Army List, various dates.Grierson, pp. 185‚Äì6.Westlake, Rifle Volunteers, pp. 78‚Äì81.'Story of the Royal Scots' at Electric ScotlandJ.T. Thomson, 'The 1st City of Edinburgh Rifle Volunteer Corps', Soldiers of the Queen, No58/59, January 1990.6th & 9th Bns Royal Scots at Scottish Military Articles. Localisation Under the 'Localisation of Forces' scheme introduced in 1872 by the Cardwell Reforms, the unit was grouped with the 1st Regiment of Foot (the Royal Scots), the Edinburgh Light Infantry Militia, the QERVB and a number of other RVCs from neighbouring counties into Brigade No 62. When these were combined into a single regiment under the Childers Reforms of 1881, the 2nd Edinburgh RVC became a Volunteer Battalion (VB) of the Royal Scots, being numbered 4th VB in 1888. Two additional companies were added in 1900: G Company at Portobello, Edinburgh, and H Company at the Church of Scotland Teacher Training College. The frontage of the Gilmore Place drill hall today. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1; Appendix A.Spiers, pp. 228‚Äì9. Under this scheme the 4th VB was included in the Forth Brigade based at 51 Hanover Street, Edinburgh, later at Surgeons' Hall. In 1902 the Forth Brigade was split into the 1st and 2nd Lothian Brigades, with the 4th VB in the 1st Brigade. It also belonged to the 32nd Brigade of the field army and trained with it for a fortnight each year. The unit's headquarters (HQ) was at Gilmore Place drill hall, Edinburgh, and in common with other Edinburgh Volunteer units it used a rifle range at Hunters Bog in Holyrood Park Second Boer War Sixty-four volunteers from 4th VB served in Volunteer Service Companies of the Royal Scots and the Scottish Volunteer Cyclist Company in the Second Boer War, earning ihe battalion its first Battle honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì02.Leslie. From 1905, the commanding officer (CO) was Lt-Col George McCrae, VD, who in 1914 raised the 16th Bn Royal Scots ('McCrae's Battalion'), a Kitchener's Army unit containing a number of players from Heart of Midlothian F.C.. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 4th VB became the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots, with its HQ remaining at Gilmore Place.London Gazette 20 March 1908.'The Territorial Army/Army Reserve' at the Royal Scots website. The battalion remained attached to the Lothian Bde, which did not join any of the TF's new infantry divisions but continued independently in its coast defence role.Conrad, 1914. World War I =Mobilisation= On the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, the Lothian Brigade mobilised at Edinburgh as part of Scottish Coastal Defences.HQ 221 Mixed Brigade War Diary 4 August 1914 ‚Äì 30 July 1919, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 95/5458.Royal Scots at Long, Long Trail.'WWI Battalions' at the Royal Scots website. Almost immediately, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix, and a 2nd Lothian Brigade was formed from these units. 3rd Line training units were formed in 1915. The only TF battalion of the Royal Scots that did not immediately form a 2nd line was the 6th Bn, which instead provided two companies of reinforcements to bring 1/4th and 1/8th Bns Royal Scots up to war establishment.'Territorials/Dardanelles' at the Royal Scots website.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. A 2/6th Battalion was finally formed in March 1915. =1/6th Royal Scots= Having contributed large drafts to other battalions, 1/6th Bn did not leave the Lothian Bde until 5 September 1915Brander, p. 58. when it went to Egypt to join the Western Frontier Force (WFF) on 20 November. After serving with the WFF in the Senussi Campaign it was sent to France on 27 February 1916 for Line of communication duties on the Western Front. 1/6th Battalion arrived at Marseilles on 15 May 1916 and was immediately amalgamated with 1/5th Bn Royal Scots.LoC units at Regimental Warpath.WFF at Regimental Warpath. =5th/6th Royal Scots= ::See main article 5th/6th Royal Scots On 29 July the combined 5th/6th Bn joined 14th Bde in 32nd Division. The 32nd was a Kitchener's Army formation that had been bolstered by the Regular 14th Bde. It had suffered heavy casualties on the First day of the Somme (1 July)Edmonds 1916, pp. 409‚Äì10, 421. and 5th/6th Royal Scots replaced one of its shattered battalions.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21‚Äì9.32nd Division at Long, Long Trail.32nd Division at Regimental Warpath. On 18 November, 14th Bde took part in the Battle of the Ancre Heights the last action of the Somme offensive.Miles, pp. 512‚Äì24. It then took part in minor operations along the Ancre in January and February 1917, and then followed the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) in March and April. Falls, France and Belgium 1917, Vol I, pp. 156‚Äì8. The division then moved to the Flanders coast to support an expected breakthrough at Ypres that never came.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 116‚Äì22. In April 1918, 32nd Division was sent as reinforcements to help stop the German Spring Offensive (Operation Michael).Edmonds, 1918, Vol II, p. 111. 32nd Division was in reserve when the Allied Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August at the Battle of Amiens, though 5th/6th RS was briefly engaged. The battalion then led the division's attack on 11 August.Brander, p. 68.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 144‚Äì5.During the Battle of the Scarpe (28 August) 5th/6th RS's advance was described as 'a procession', and soon after dawn the next day they had pushed right up to the river.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 330, 339. On 5 September one company of the battalion waded across at the site of Brie bridge and cleared the far bank.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 445‚Äì6. Facing the most formidable part of the Hindenburg Line on the St Quentin Canal, 5th/6th RS went into action on 1 October against the village of Sequehart. The village changed hands four times until on 3 October the battalion, which had specifically asked for another chance to take the village, succeeded in holding it.Brander, p. 71.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 139, 142, 163. When the Battle of the Sambre opened on 4 November. Two platoons of 5th/6th RS were given the task of attacking le Donjon two minutes after Zero Hour behind a special barrage. By 13.30 the whole battalion had crossed the river.Blaxland, p. 256.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, pp. 470‚Äì1. After the Armistice with Germany, 32nd Division was chosen as part of the occupation force (the British Army of the Rhine). On 3 February 1919 the division took over the southern sector of the Cologne bridgehead, but by then the remaining TF units were being demobilised. and 5th/6th Royal Scots left for home between 25 February and 19 March. =2/6th Royal Scots= The 2/6th Battalion was finally formed at Edinburgh in March 1915. It moved to Peebles in May, and in November was attached to 195th Bde in 65th (2nd Lowland) Division at Cambuslang. That month the infantry battalions in the 64th (2nd Highland) and 65th (2nd Lowland) Divisions were reorganised and numbered sequentially, the 2/4th, 2/5th and 2/6th Royal Scots temporarily combining as No 19 Battalion; by May 1916 they had reverted to their previous regimental designations, but 2/6th remained merged with 2/4th.Becke Pt 2b, pp. 61‚Äì5. =3/6th Royal Scots= The 3/6th Battalion was formed in 1915 as a training unit. In April 1916 it was redesignated 6th Reserve Bn, Royal Scots, but in September it was merged into the 4th Reserve Bn at Catterick Garrison. =6th Scottish Provisional Battalion= In 1915 the Home Service men of the 4th, 5th and 6th Royal Scots were combined into 6th Scottish Provisional Battalion, which joined the Lothian Brigade (redesignated the Scottish Provisional Brigade and later 1st Provisional Brigade) on 22 May. In April 1916 the 1st Provisional Bde moved from Scotland to Kent to take over coastal defence duties. The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit, and the remaining provisional battalions were reorganised, but the 6th Provisional Bn had already been disbanded and its men dispersed.Army Council Instruction No 221, January 1916, Appendix 18.Army Council Instruction No 2364, 17 December 1916, Appendix 204.David Porter's work on Provisional Brigades at Great War Forum. Disbandment :: See main article 51st (Lowland) Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery Although the TF battalions of the Royal Scots were all reformed in 1920, several of them were amalgamated or converted to other roles when the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921. The 6th and 8th Bns Royal Scots each provided batteries to 57th (Lowland) Medium Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery:Litchfield, p 296. * HQ at 6 Wemyss Place, Edinburgh * 225 (City of Edinburgh) Medium Bty at Drill Hall, 124 McDonald Road, Edinburgh ‚Äì from Lowland Hy Bty, RGA * 226 (City of Edinburgh) Medium Bty (Howitzers) at Drill Hall, Dalmeny Street, Leith ‚Äì from 6th Bn Royal Scots * 227 (Haddingtonshire) Medium Bty (Howitzers) at Drill Hall, Dalmeny Street, Leith ‚Äì from 8th Bn Royal Scots * 228 (Peeblesshire and Midlothian) Medium Bty (Howitzers) at High Street, Dunbar ‚Äì from 8th Bn Royal Scots (The Dalmeny Street Drill Hall had previously belonged to the 7th (Leith) Battalion, Royal Scots.Lothians at Great War Centenary Drill Halls.) Shortly before the outbreak of World War II the TA was doubled in size and 57th (Lowland) split into two medium regiments, 226 (City of Edinburgh) Bty remaining with the 57th, which was soon afterwards converted into 51st (Lowland) Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery. This regiment served in the Battle of France and the campaign in North West Europe, and then as 357th (Lowland) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, in the postwar TA until it disappeared in a succession of amalgamations during 1956‚Äì61. Uniforms and insignia The uniform of the original 3rd Edinburgh RVC was scarlet tunics with blue facings, blue trousers with a broad scarlet stripe, and blue shakoes with a red-and-white ball tuft, later replaced by a scarlet upright horsehair plume. The British League Cadet Corps wore red Garibaldi shirts, blue forage caps and knickerbockers, and brown canvas leggings. In 1882 the renumbered 2nd Edinburgh RVC adopted blue helmets in place of shakoes. After it became the 4th VB Royal Scots, the unit adopted the uniform of that regiment, wearing tartan trews in place of trousers. The helmet was replaced with a Glengarry bonnet in 1904. Honorary Colonels The following served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * John Hope, founding CO, appointed 27 June 1883 * William U. Martin, VD, former CO, appointed 4 April 1900 * Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener, appointed 19 August 1905 Victoria Cross Lieutenant David Stuart McGregor of the 6th Bn won a posthumous Victoria Cross at Hoogemolen on 22 October 1918 while attached to the Machine Gun Corps.

According to the complaint, officers put Turner in the back seat of the cruiser, since he refused to give ID, saying \\"We're gonna make you sweat,\\" and Turner demanded to speak to a supervisor. Lieutenant Driver showed up, also requesting Turner's identification which was also refused. After a short period of time, which was not more particularly described, Turner was released.

Holloway in 1950 Edward Estis Holloway (June 12, 1908 ‚Äì April 8, 1993) was a Philadelphia cardiologist who also served as the last elected city coroner. Holloway was born in 1908 in Philadelphia, the son of Daniel Holloway and Margaret Estis Holloway. Daniel Holloway was a doctor, one of just a few African Americans practicing medicine at the time. As a boy, Holloway often accompanied his father as he made housecalls on horseback in Southwest Philadelphia. After graduating from Central High School and Howard University, the son followed his father into the medical profession. He interned at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C., before returning to his hometown in 1937 and starting his own practice in North Philadelphia. He married Mildred Brazington in 1938, but they divorced in the early 1940s. In 1944, he married again, to Ruth Smart, a social worker. Holloway quickly became recognized as one of the top men in his field; despite a lack of formal post-graduate training, he was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1946. In 1950, he became the second black doctor ever elected to the American College of Physicians. In 1955, he was the first ever elected to the American Board of Cardiovascular Diseases. In 1953, Holloway married again, to Carmen Chisholm, with whom he later had two daughters, Michelle and Cheryl. That same year, he ran in the local election for Philadelphia city coroner as a Republican and won. He never took office, however, as the Democratic-majority City Council abolished several county offices, including coroner, and converted the jobs to civil service positions. Holloway and city treasurer Francis D. Pastorius filed suit to retain their offices, but were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Holloway's medical career progressed as he rose from an instructor at Women's Medical College to a clinical associate professor of medicine. He also gained a reputation as an engaging speaker at medical conferences. He served as the final chief of staff at Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital and the only chief of staff at its successor, Mercy-Douglass Hospital. Holloway and his wife divorced in 1977. He married for the last time soon thereafter to Agatha Lawson. He continued to practice medicine until 1991, when he retired. Two years later, Holloway died at the age of 84 at Philadelphia's Graduate Hospital and was buried at Mount Lawn Cemetery in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania.

The church contains several medieval murals. History The church was built in the 1190s and originally consisted of a nave, choir and apses. Several alterations were made to the church already during the Middle Ages. A wide, western tower was built during the 13th century but later reduced in height and transformed into a western expansion of the nave; a new tower was built on the south side of the church in the late Middle Ages. During the 15th century, a church porch was also built and the original ceiling of the church replaced with the presently visible vaults. Further, less substantial alterations were made during the 18th century, and in 1803 the medieval apse was replaced with the present, pentagonal apse which contains the sacristy. The original entrances were walled up in 1843 and a new, western entrance constructed. A western church porch was placed in front of the entrance in 1901. Murals Knislinge Church, interior The church contains fragments of murals from the earliest building period of the church, concealed above the vaults, as well as on the underside of the arch separating the choir from the nave. The latter are Romanesque in style and depict the Lamb of God flanked by two bishops trampling dragons. Most of the murals of the church however date from 1460-61 and were made soon after the vaults which they decorate. They were covered with whitewash in the 1720s but were restored in 1924. They were possibly made by Nils H√•kansson. They depict religious themes, e.g. Saint George and the Dragon and Saint Nicholas, but also profane subjects. Furnishings The church retains its original baptismal font, a decorated Romanesque font made of sandstone. Its sculptures depict scenes from the childhood of Christ. Notable is also the altarpiece a work from the late 16th century, possibly from the workshop of Daniel Tommisen in Malm√∂. The pulpit is from 1747, made by sculptor Johan Ullberg and considered one of his finest works.

It is now operated as a museum and nature centre under Roskilde Museum. It used to belong to Aastrup Manor. History A watermill has been located at the site since the 15th century. The millers on the property were copyholders under √Östrup Manor. The mill had lands attached making it possible to run a small farm along with the mill. The current watermill was built as a grain mill in circa 1840. The site also included a stamp mill. The watermill was later converted into a saw mill. Tadre Watermill painted by Viggo Langer in 1938 Christian Henrik Hansen, a miller from Funen, leased the watermill in 1914. His 12-year-old daughter Marie assisted him in the work. She continued the operations after her father's death in 1845. She never married and operated the watermill alone while a farmhand was responsible for managing the associated farmland. Marie Hansen became a well-known figure among millers since it was highly unusual for a woman to handle the heavy mill work alone. Marie Hansen purchased the watermill in 1952. It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959. In 1989 she chose to sell it to the state to ensure its preservation. She placed the money in a foundation that was to preserve it in return for a right to live in it for the rest of her life. She died at the age of 100 on 4 February 2003. Architecture The mill is built on a base of boulders with half-timbered walls and board cladding on the gables. The roof is thatched with straw and the milling equipment is in almost original condition. Today The watermill is owned by the Danish Nature Agency and operated by Roskilde Museum. The barn contains an exhibition about Elverdamsdalen and its watermills.

The company also sells their ciders under the name Cidergeist, using an alternative apple-shaped skull logo. The brewery's taproom and production facility is located in Cincinnati's Over-the- Rhine neighborhood, and occupies the former, pre-Prohibition bottling plant of Christian Moerlein Brewing Co. Rhinegeist operates an additional shipping, storage and innovation brewing facility in Cincinnati's Camp Washington neighborhood. Rhinegeist was the 28th largest independent craft brewery in the United States and the 2nd largest in Ohio by sales volume. Rhinegeist currently distributes its products in Ohio, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. The brewery self-distributes in Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio. Rhinegeist's annual beer production was in 2018. Rhinegeist's brew hall in 2014  History  = Origins = Rhinegeist was founded by Bob Bonder and Bryant Goulding, who first met in 2005 when working together as business consultants in San Francisco. After Bob moved to Cincinnati in 2007, he called Bryant in August 2011 with an idea for a brewery in the city, which he thought was \\"a vacuum for locally brewed craft beer.\\" After planning for several months, Bryant moved to Cincinnati in July 2012. Searching for a brewer, the duo found Jim Matt, a pharmaceutical chemist and homebrewing hobbyist. They tasted some of his homebrews, including two that would later evolve into Rhinegeist's Uncle and Truth beers, and decided to bring him on board. After securing funding from local investors, they leased a building in Over-the-Rhine that had formerly served as Christian Moerlein Brewing's packaging hall. Construction work began in January 2013 and lasted until mid-2013. = Opening and early local success = Rhinegeist officially opened its doors to the public on June 29, 2013. Their lineup on opening day consisted of Uncle, Spikelet, Cougar, and Truth, which are a British mild ale, a hoppy wheat beer, a blonde ale, and an IPA respectively. They served around 2,500 customers on that day. They began opening their brewery taproom every Thursday through Sunday and distributing to local bars. By mid-July, they were distributing to about eight bars and were near the upper limit of their production capacity. Rhinegeist began selling its beer in cans in February 2014, starting with Cougar and Truth. They added a third beer, a session pale ale called Zen, to their can lineup in May. The cans were available in five Kroger supermarkets by July, and in 65 by September. In December, they announced plans to expand to Kentucky with a new distribution facility in Erlanger. Market research firm IRI reported that Rhinegeist was the top new craft beer vendor of 2014 in U.S. supermarkets, based on $782,539 in supermarket sales. The brewery sold nearly 11,000 barrels of beer in 2014. By late 2014, the brewery and its founders started receiving national attention. In September 2014, Bryant Goulding was credited by GQ as a craft beer expert. In November 2014, Rhinegeist's Truth IPA was named to a list of the 100 best beers in the world by Men's Journal. = Regional expansion = In March 2015, the brewery announced plans to install a new brewing system that would enable them to triple their production rate and expand into the Columbus market. In May 2015, they announced plans to open a small-scale brewing facility in Columbus. They also expanded into hard ciders with the introduction of their new Cidergeist product line. They launched their first two ciders in their taproom in July before distributing them broadly to markets and restaurants in October. By the end of 2015, they were selling beer and cider in Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus, and parts of Kentucky, and IRI reported they had sold 31,470 barrels that year. Rhinegeist continued to expand its market reach over the years that followed. Rhinegeist arrived in Cleveland and Boston in fall of 2016. This was followed by Pittsburgh in March 2017, Indiana in July 2017, and Nashville in February 2019. In 2020 Rhinegeist expanded to East Tennessee and Wisconsin. According to founder Bryant Goulding, the company focuses its expansion on individual cities that are close to their existing markets, as a majority of their beer is self-distributed and must be delivered from their fleet of vans for freshness. The brewery's production and sales volume increased with the market growth. Their annual production increased to 56,500 barrels in 2016, 86,242 barrels in 2017, and 100,302 barrels in 2018. In 2017, Rhinegeist was 33rd in 2017 on the Brewers Association's list of the largest craft brewing companies by sales volume, and in 2018, they moved up to 28th on the list. As Rhinegeist's availability was growing on a national level, so too was its popularity. In February 2016, Rhinegeist earned second place in a USA Today Readers' Choice New Breweries poll. In March 2017, Forbes called Rhinegeist \\"arguably one of the hippest beer brands in the country.\\" In April 2019, they were included on Thrillist's \\"32 Hottest Breweries in America Right Now.\\" In November 2019, they were included in Paste's \\"50 Best American Breweries of the 2010s.\\"  Products  Rhinegeist Crash, with default logo Rhinegeist offers four beers, two fruited ales and two ciders in cans year- round. Additionally, each year the brewery releases dozens of seasonal and limited canned, bottled and draft-only products. To date, it has released over 200 different beers and ciders. = Year-round products = * Truth (IPA) ‚Äî recognized as one 100 best beers in the world by Men's Journal. * Knowledge (Imperial IPA) * Cheetah (Lager) * Whiffle (Witbier) * Bubbles (Ros√© Ale) * Little Bubs (Session Ros√© Ale) * Semi Dry (Cider) * Swizzle (Cider)  Location  Rhinegeist's brew hall hosted the announcement party for FC Cincinnati being awarded a Major League Soccer franchise. Rhinegeist's main brew hall and taproom are located in a facility in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. The taproom is open seven days a week and is open to all ages, offering games such as corn hole. In late 2015, Rhinegeist opened a rooftop bar at the facility which is restricted to patrons 21 or older. Rhinegeist's brew hall can also be rented out for private events; in the brewery's first five years, it hosted more than 250 weddings and more than 750 events. In May 2018, Cincinnati Museum Center opened an exhibit of a Galeamopus dinosaur skeleton in Rhinegeist's brew hall. On May 29, 2018, Rhinegeist hosted the announcement event for a FC Cincinnati's expansion franchise in Major League Soccer.  Rare Beer Fest  Rhinegeist hosts an annual, invitational beer festival called Rare Beer Fest. Participating breweries are asked to bring their rarest products, which are sampled by ticket holders over the course of two sessions. Past participating breweries include 21st Amendment Brewery, Allagash Brewing Company, Bell's Brewery, Brooklyn Brewery and Mikkeller.

Early career  Wannapho was born in 1842 to a commoner family with claims of distant noble ancestry, and was educated in the temples and at court.Baker, Christopher, Phongpaichit, Pasuk \\"A History of Thailand\\" pg. 75 He started his career as a merchant, traveling as far afield as Singapore for trade, before pursuing a second career as a lawyer. During his legal career, he was an advocate for the poor against the abuses and corruption of the Thai upper class. His outspokenness drew the antipathy of the powerful ruling class, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment on a technicality in 1882, but was released in 1898.Beck, Sanderson \\"Siam, Cambodia, and Laos 1800-1950\\"  Advocating modernization  After his release from prison, Wannapho became a vigorous advocate of modernization and Westernization.

King Rama V abolished slavery in the later part of his reign, and later polygamy was also formally banned (though persisting in practice).

The song was inspired by an experience by band frontman Luke Bentham, where he fell asleep in the tour bus and had a dream about crashing and dying a fiery death. The song was developed relatively quickly; the experience left him shook up, so he wrote down scratch lyrics right away upon awakening, and wrote the song's guitar riff at the band's next soundcheck.

She went on to earn a Master of Landscape Architecture, with distinction, from Harvard University in 1999.  Career  M'Closkey has been active as a landscape architect for over 10 years.https://nextcity.org/daily/author/karen-m8217closkey Her work focuses on the role of technology in landscape architecture. The relationship between digital media and landscape architecture is still in its early days, but M'Closkey is regarded as one of its most influential voices. She is an advocate of using digital modeling to design for complex systems of understand change over time with more accuracy. She explores these themes in both her academic and professional work. The firm PEG Office of Landscape + Architecture, which she co-founded with Keith VanDerSys, experiments with both digital modeling and new materials. The firm has worked with agencies such as the Philadelphia Water Department and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. The firm is particularly notable for its use of parametric modeling and scripting, which allows M'Closkey to recognize and responds to pattern in landscape in designs.https://worldlandscapearchitect.com/edaphic-effects- philadelphia-usa-peg/ Modeling also helps the team recognize patterns in climate change and urbanization which are not currently visible to landscape architects. The firm is described as being on the forefront of \\"digitally- driven\\" design practices, in contrast with firms that use technology purely to represent their designs. M'Closkey teaches these concepts in the Landscape Architecture department at PennDesign. She teaches core design studios, option studios, and Contemporary Theories of Landscape Architecture. The advanced option studios explore how repetition, ornamentation, and surface modulation can create new landscape forms. M‚ÄôCloskey co-organized a symposium at the University of Pennsylvania with VanDerSys. The symposium, called ‚ÄúSimulating Natures,‚Äù explored the role of environmental modeling and simulation tools in contemporary landscape architecture. The symposium was accompanied by an issue of LA+ Journal exploring the same themes and questions.https://dirt.asla.org/2015/04/02/simulating-nature/ She is the guest editor (with Keith VanDerSys) of two issues of LA+ on the themes Simulation (2016) and GEO (forthcoming 2020).

His murder was a matter of dispute between the Soviet Union and the regional government in Xinjiang, with Sheng Shicai claiming his brother's murder was orchestrated by the Soviets in order to stage a coup, while the Soviets claimed Sheng ordered his brother's murder because of his close ties to Moscow.  Life  The fourth younger brother of Sheng Shicai, a de facto independent ruler of the Chinese Xinijiang Province, Sheng Shiqi graduated from the Cavalry Division of the NCO School in Tokyo, Japan, and was the instructor of the Nanjing Army Cavalry School. His brother Sheng already served as member of Governor of Xinjiang Jin Shuren's staff when in 1932 Shiqi became the chief of the security guards of the Xinjiang Border Defence Office. All this occurred within the frame of fierce fighting between the Hui forces of General Ma Zhongying aligned to the Nationalist government and the Xinjiang's provincial government. As Ma's forces were sieging √úr√ºmqi between December 1932 and March 1933, and Jin started to lose the hold on the city, Sheng Shicai arrived in order to seize the power by himself, with the support from the White Russians and the provincial bureaucrats. The coup leaders appointed him the Commissioner of the Xinjiang Border Defence, i. e., Military Governor or duban on 14 April 1933. During Sheng Shicai's rule, Xinjiang was effectively under the Soviet control, largely independent from the Nationalist government. In 1934, Shiqi married Chen Xiuying, a daughter of a local magistrate. He went to Moscow in May 1937 to study at the Moscow Military Academy \\"Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze\\". His wife lived with him and was completely Russified while in Moscow. In the winter of 1941‚Äì42, after his studies, he returned to Xinjiang, and was given command of a motorized brigade in √úr√ºmqi. According to his brother Sheng, Shiqi contributed greatly in training of Xinjiang's motorized brigade, in consolidating Xinjiang's administration and strengthening border defences. The position of the brigade commander gave Shiqi extensive military power.  Murder  With the German forces invading the Soviet Union, Sheng Shicai used the opportunity to end the Soviet influence by striking down the Chinese communists, who served as the Soviet proxies and to approach the Central government. Shiqi was murdered on 19 March 1942. His death is considered mysterious. According to one version, the Soviets, fearing that Sheng Shicai might switch sides, attempted a coup, convincing Sheng Shiqi's wife to commit his murder. Another version proposes that he was murdered by Sheng Shicai because of his close ties to Moscow. On March 19, 1942, Sheng Shiqi went back home with his younger brother Sheng Shiji. The two whispered in the living room for a long time, and then entered their mother's room where Sheng Shicai was also present. However, the conversation did not go well; Sheng Shiqi berated his wife for not taking good care of their daughter to vent his anger. Then his wife, Chen Xiuying, went to the kitchen to boil herbal medicine while Sheng Shiqi was talking to his daughter in the bedroom. Suddenly, Chen Xiuying heard the bang of a gun; when she rushed into the room, she saw Sheng Shiqi fell to the ground and was killed on the spot. In Sheng Shicai's opinion, his brother Sheng Shiqi was killed by his wife Chen Xiuying, who was arrested on the 21 March. In Chen Xiuying's confession, she was convinced by her husband's friend, Ratov, who told her that Sheng Shiqi had an affair. Out of jealousy, she started seeing Ratov. However, this relationship was discovered by Xiao Zuoxin, who blackmailed Chen for sex and later forced her to murder Sheng Shiqi for her own safety. However, Vyacheslav Molotov, the Soviet Union's Foreign Minister rebutted Sheng Shicai's accusation and stated Bakulin, Ratov and other senior officials were reliable persons, who were dedicated to maintaining Soviet- Chinese friendship for a long time. After learning about the incident, the Soviets believed that Shiqi's murder was part of the Sheng Shicai's preparation to rely on the Central government. Allen S. Whiting, who interviewed Sheng Shicai and coauthored a book with him, expressed an opinion that Shiqi might have been murdered on the orders of Sheng Shicai, because of his pro-Soviet stance and opposition to the rapprochement to the Central government or opposition to the purge against the Chinese communists. Andrew D. W. Forbes concurs with this opinion, stating that Shiqi was apparently murdered because of his pro-Soviet views. On the contrary, Sheng Shicai's biographer from mainland China Cai Jinsong, who interviewed Sheng's sister-in- laws, concluded that Shiqi's death was probably a homicide, perpetrated by the Soviets with the help from Chen, which they tried to cover up as a suicide. After Shiqi's death, Sheng Shicai continued to crack down on Chinese communists. In July 1942 he ordered their relocation in the √úr√ºmqi outskirts for \\"protection\\". As the Central government was gaining the full control over the Xinjiang, Sheng Shicai ordered the communists to be executed, among them Mao Zemin, Mao Zedong's brother, in September 1943.

Details Located along Divanyolu Street, Piyer Loti Street and Boyacƒ± Ahmed Street, across from the tomb of Sultan Mahmut II in the Emin√∂n√º district of Istanbul, the K√∂pr√ºl√º library was built by K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed Pasha, the son of sadrazam (grand vizier) K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmet Pasha, on the last wish of his father. K√∂pr√ºl√ºzade Fazƒ±l Mustafa Pasha completed the establishment of the library at √áemberlita≈ü with the composition of a vakƒ±f (non-for-profit organization) charter in 1678. The library was opened with its staff being composed of three librarians, one binder, and one janitor. The first book was donated by the K√∂pr√ºl√º family, and the number of available books continued to increase with further donations and purchases. Of all the donations to the library, those by K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmet Pasha, Fazil Ahmet Pasa, Haci (Hafiz) Ahmet Pasha, and Mehmet Asim Bey were among the most substantial. Its collection contains 3,790 manuscripts in Turkish, Arabic and Persian as well as approximately 1,500 printed works. The catalogue of the K√∂pr√ºl√º Library was prepared by Ramazan ≈ûe≈üen, Cevat ƒ∞zgi and Cemil Akpƒ±nar and was published in 1986. K√∂pr√ºl√º library houses one of the most important Islamic manuscript collections in the world. The author, book, and subject lists of manuscripts and printed works are organized according to the Dewey Decimal Classification method. The K√∂pr√ºl√º Library is one of the first examples of an independent library design in Istanbul. It is located in a garden, whose three sides are surrounded by streets and is constructed with alternating stones and bricks. It is covered by a dome placed on an octagonal rim on the outside with a pendentive square plan. The arcade part, which is reached by a four-step staircase in the western section of the library, was moved to the front and has assumed a T-shape. There is a diamond-shaped head placed on top of six marble pillars, spire arch arcade is covered with four domes. The library is accessed through a low-pitched door in the central axis of the arcade. The interior is illuminated by windows, with one on each side, two in the upper level, and three each with six upper part windows across the entrance. There are spire discharge arches with rectangular jambs. The interior surface of the dome and pendentives are decorated with over-the-gate pen works. Both \\"C\\" and \\"S\\" curves attract visitors‚Äô attention among these brown, black and red ornamentations. Written underneath the flower designs are the word, \\"Ma≈üallah,\\" and date, 1181 Hijri (1667-1668). Furthermore, both \\"Masallah\\" and the date of 1289 Hijri (1872) and 1327 Hijri (1911) are written on the inner door.

He worked as a tax officer as well as developing his inventions. He is the son of an officer who fought in the revolutionary and then Napoleonic armies and ended his career with the rank of lieutenant colonel, was made officer of the legion of honor (1807) and received the title of baron of the Empire.

Festival of the Lairai dhondachi zatra The festival is known as the Lairai dhondachi zatra and usually occurs around the months of April or May each year. In keeping with the syncretic traditions that some areas in Goa are known for, the goddess Lairai is considered by some to be a \\"sister\\" of the Milagris Saibinn (Virgin Mary) in the Milagres Church of Mapusa, some or so away from the area. The village is estimated to have 350 houses, 70 wells and 32 springs. But the area faces a water shortage due to rampant mining nearby. Fire walking On the night of the zatra, an estimated 20,000 dhonds‚Äîmen and women from diverse parts of Goa and the nearby Konkan region‚Äîwalk through the homkhan, over a burning charcoal bed. Shrigao has shrines dedicated to a number of deities (14, according to one count) including Santer, Mahamaya, Ravalnath, Mahadev, Grampurush, Kshetrapal, Aapevans, Kulkar, Brahman, Homkhandi, Purush, Lakhamo, Aairo and Mharingan, of whom the goddess Lairai‚Äîconsidered to be an incarnation of goddess Parvati‚Äîis treated with particular reverence. The official Goa Tourism site describes the festival thus: > In the early hours of the morning when the fire has died down, the raking of > the coals begins. The devotees await their turn to walk on the holy path of > hot coals. Around 4 a.m., the actual ritual starts, with the devotees > running through the hot coals carrying their sticks and shouting the name of > Devi Lairai. As the crowd watches in stunned silence, some devotees do the > 'hot run' once, others do it several times. Those who have finished their > run, then remove and throw their flower garlands onto a nearby banyan tree > and return home. The jatra reaches its conclusion as the sun rises in the > distant hills. GoanFestivals.in says that \\"One of the most looked forward event in the Hindu calendar of religious festivities is the fire walking held at Shirgao, near Assanora in the Bicholim Taluka.\\" Mining Shirgao is also part of the North Goa mining belt.

She is the founder of Camp Diva, and the CEO of Girls For A Change (GFAC) in 2012. As the CEO of GFAC, Patton works diligently to support and empower young girls of color to feel seen, heard, and celebrated as they enter into womanhood. Through before and after school programs and summer camps, GFAC teaches these young colored females, ages 6-14, key skills in order for them to have a bright future. GFAC works to better the neighborhoods and cities surrounding Richmond, Virginia by creating and demonstrating social change. In 2012, Patton gained national attention when she gave her speech, \\"A father-daughter dance...in prison\\" at the TEDxWomen conference. Her speech explained how Camp Diva started a father- daughter dance for girls who have fathers in prison and the impact the dance had on their relationship and the Richmond community. This emotional and inspirational speech was watched by over 800,000 people. Patton has received honors and awards at the local, state, and national level due to her work within the organization.  Education  Patton studied and completed her Business Administration degree at ECPI University. At Virginia Commonwealth University, she received her certification in Non-profit Management. This certificate allowed her to develop the skills and knowledge needed to create and develop her own non-profit organizations, such as Camp Diva and Spa Travelers, a group for Richmond women struggling with the effects of poverty, domestic violence, and single motherhood.  Work  Patton spent time working with other non-profit organizations surrounding the Richmond, VA area, such as the YMCA, the Children's Museum of Richmond, and the Richmond AIDS Ministry. Patton is also a licensed nurse and doula, who supported new mothers and those living with AIDS. Patton serves on the board of the East District Family Resource Center, which extended a helping hand to East End citizens by providing emergency assistance programs, education initiatives, and career development programs. All together, Patton has spent over 20 years working in the non-profit sector to support and empower marginalized individuals in the United States. = Camp Diva = Camp Diva was founded in 2004 to honor and remember Diva Mstadi Smith-Roan, a five-year-old African-American girl who died in a firearm accident earlier that year. Patton worked with Clover Smith, Diva's mother, to create a summer camp that would allow Diva's spirit to live on. During this five-week retreat, African-American girls, ages 11‚Äì15, engage in fun camp activities, such as cooking, sewing, dancing, and swimming. Through these activities, the campers learn important social skills that equip and develop the characteristics of a true woman. Throughout the past years, Camp Diva has been able to offer specialized before and after school programs in which the young girls are introduced to the ideas of entrepreneurship, career opportunities, and practical life skills. In order for Camp Diva to stay affordable or free for these lower-income families, Camp Diva raises their financial support through hosting fundraisers and events. = Father- Daughter Dance In Prison = In 2007, Camp Diva hosted their first annual father-daughter dance. The purpose of this event was to establish how crucial a father-daughter relationship is to the development of a girl entering into womanhood. As the dance attendance grew each year, Patton realized that there was still a significant number of girls who could not participate at the \\"Date with Dad Dance\\" because their fathers were in prison. Therefore, Patton and the young girls took it upon themselves to write to the Richmond City Jail for permission to host their own father-daughter dance within the walls of the jail. The Richmond City Jail agreed to hosting the dance, realizing that good family connection encourages inmates to turn their life around. In order to attending the dance, the inmates were required to take a 30-hour parenting class. On March 17, 2013, 16 inmates and 18 girls attended the first annual father-daughter dance‚Äîin jail. This event became nationally recognized after being featured in a Washington Post article and the release of Patton's TED talk. While Camp Diva continues to host their annual father-daughter dance at the Richmond City Jail, other prisons, such as Miami's Federal Detention Center and the Omaha Correctional Center, have started their very own father- daughter dance for young girls with incarcerated fathers.  Awards and Recognition  Patton's work for her community has not gone unnoticed. Patton has been awarded the title of \\"Virginians Making a Difference\\" and \\"The Cultural and Leadership Award\\". Patton received these titles of recognition because of her non-profit work in the Richmond Metropolitan area. After Patton's TED talk was released and featured on NPR, ABC World News, and Inside Edition, her mission and vision became recognizable across the nation. So much so, that in 2016 Patton was nominated and awarded by President Obama as a \\"Champion of Change for Enrichment for Marginalized Girls‚Äù. This title was given to ten individuals who work to improve and empower the lives of marginalized girls through extracurricular and after-school programs. Several foundations have committed to helping GFAC financially. For example, in 2003, Girls For A Change received a three-year grant by the Draper Richards Foundation. This grant helped GFAC establish and launch programs and activities within the organization. In 2014, GFAC also received a generous grant from the Allianz Foundation.

He was born at Wilton, Wiltshire near Salisbury the son of a servant of William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. He was primarily a clockmaker, and was, until the middle of the seventeenth century, accounted the first violinist in England in point of skill. He may be said to occupy the position of the earliest English violinist of note. Anthony Wood says that Mell was \\"one of the musick to King Charles I,\\" and \\"had a sweet stroke.\\"Anthony √† Wood, Life and Times (Oxf. Hist. Soc.), i. 241, 257‚Äì8, cited in DNB.

The company did look upon Mr. Mell to have a prodigious hand on the violin, and they thought that no person, as all in London did, could goe beyond him. But when Tho Baltzar, an Outlander, came to Oxon in the next yeare, they had other thoughts of Mr. Mell, who tho he played farr sweeter than Baltzar, yet Baltzar's hand was more quick.\\" Elsewhere Wood describes Mell as \\"a well-bred gentleman, and not given to excessive drinking as Baltzar was.\\" Wood seems to have entertained him at Oxford in August 1658.

He was succeeded in 1661 by Baltzar. Some of Mell's compositions for the instrument are to be found in Christopher Simpson's Division Viol (1659).

For these Olympus Marathons the classic distance of 42.195 kilometers provides a clue to the distance of some of the runs in the Olympus. Starting in 2010, events established that surpass the classic marathon distance. In some races, runners run over distances of 57 km, 70 km or almost 100 km. At the stations along the route, the runners are provided with drinks and snacks and mostly medical aid. They are offered water, electrolytic drinks, bananas, salty biscuits, sandwiches, chocolates and more. The medical care is provided by rescue services. The fastest runners finishes the race in about four hours.  History  Around 1970, inspired by mountain running in the Alps, the first thoughts of a marathon in Olympus came on. Younger members of the Mountaineering Association E.O.S. Thessaloniki implemented the idea; a running track was selected, the paths were cleaned and marked. The first run took place on July 6, 1986. Around 100 Greek runners participated; although starting numbers have been assigned, there are no statistics on the results of this first Olympus Marathon. The new sport was called \\"Mountaineer Marathon\\", not only on the Olympus region, but in the whole of Greece, where gradually hill running established. In the first years the number of participants varied greatly, only through the \\"outdoor movement\\" found more Greek athletes to this sport. In order to arouse international interest, the \\"Olympus Marathon\\" event was founded in 2003. The first run took place in June 2004 with the help of Litochoro Municipality and the Litochoro Mountaineering Association. Based on the tradition of the ancient Greeks, who every year, to pay homage to the gods, made a procession from Dion to the peaks of Mount Olympus, the run starts in Dion - the religious center of the Macedonians (motto: running with the gods). 115 athletes participated in the first race, of which 103 were scored. Seven of them were foreigners. In 2012 the first \\"Olympus Mythical Trail\\" was organized. It is an extreme run over about 100 kilometers which is also run at night. Since 2015, the \\"Lost Trail\\", a shortened to 57 kilometers run, offered to let the athletes on lesser known paths explore the Olympus during daylight. There are other runs in the Olympus over shorter distances, in the snow, as well as mixed competitions, such as a biathlon, where the athletes run and bike.  Organizer E.O.S.

Development Dave Bunker developed and patented the first double-necked tap/touch-style guitar, which he called the Duo'Lectar. Bunker introduced this new instrument nationally in 1955 on the Ozark Jubilee television program, and demonstrated it for the Portland Oregonian newspaper in 1960. With the addition of patented refinements, the Duo'Lectar became popularly known as the Bunker Touch Guitar. Play Twin necks define the Bunker Touch Guitar. Except for its twin necks, the Bunker Touch Guitar is similar in appearance to a typical guitar. However, it is dissimilar in its style of play. Strings on the Bunker Touch Guitar are not strummed or plucked, as in the traditional, single-necked guitar. Instead, all strings respond to touch or tap. On the Bunker Touch Guitar, a note sounds when a string is held down and stops when it is released. The left hand plays bass lines on the lower neck, while the right hand simultaneously plays lead lines on the upper neck. It has no head at the top end of the necks (as on conventional guitars) because its tuning keys are located at the base-edge of the instrument. Use The left hand plays bass and the right hand plays lead, simultaneously and by touch. The importance of the early Touch guitar to the standard single- neck guitar's evolution was acknowledged by its display at Seattle's Experience Music Project Museum (now called Museum of Pop Culture) when it opened in 2000. Dave Bunker detailed the development of his invention in a videotaped interview conducted by the museum. His uniquely designed touch guitar continued to mature, and was featured in headline shows at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas from 1964 through 1974. Selected patents incorporated specifically into the Bunker Touch Guitar have also been used in other contemporary guitar designs. The touch technique has been popularized by guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Stanley Jordan, Steve Vai, and Jeff Healey.

It was built from 1812 to 1850. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  After settling at Sydney Cove in 1788, the First Fleet soon found the soil unsuitable for farming and looked for more fertile soils beyond the established boundaries of the colony. By 1795, the settlers had journeyed to the Cumberland Plain and discovered the rich land of the Cowpastures, named after the discovery of a herd of wild cows that had escaped the colony years earlier and wandered west, grazing the land now known as the Camden district. Following the colonial discovery of the area, the colonial gentry soon regarded it as rich, fertile and suitable land for livestock grazing and pastoral pursuits. The low rambling hills and wide expanses of grass flats were devoid of difficult vegetation and reminded the colonists of the familiar landscape of an English gentleman's park. This environment was considered ideal for the establishment of the wealthy estates so desired by the colonial gentry. Quickly, the acquisition of land in the district was being sought by private colonists. The newly appointed governor, Lachlan Macquarie, agreed that the northern bank of the Nepean River should be settled and soon had the land surveyed before granting the first of the land allotments to the colonial elite from 1812. These land grants were for large scale allotments and were intended to facilitate large-scale landholdings for the wealthy colonists of the period. Of these large landholdings, a parcel was granted to Rowland Hassall in 1812. Having arrived at Sydney Cove in 1798 with wife Elizabeth and sons Thomas, Samuel Otoo and Jonathon, Hassall was one of the pioneer colonists and quickly established himself as a prominent settler by acquiring, in addition to leasing, large portions of land around Parramatta and Cobbitty. A missionary, sheep breeder and successful pastoralist, Hassall was appointed Superintendent of NSW Government Stock in 1814 and was responsible for the distribution and maintenance of stock in the Cowpastures region (one of the most extensive stock runs in the colony). During his period as Superintendent (1814‚Äì19), Hassall was assisted by his second son Samuel Otoo who himself became a pastoralist. After receiving the land grant from Governor Macquarie in 1812, Hassall named the property Macquarie Grove and built the original farmhouse (now Hassall Cottage) in an elevated position beside the Nepean River in . Governor Macquarie was to visit the farm in 1815 during a tour of the Cowpastures region and, after camping overnight, referred to the property as \\"Mr Hassall's finely appointed and beautiful farm\\". With the development of the farm and the formal establishment of the Camden township in 1840, Hassall went on to construct a larger homestead to the south-west of the original farmhouse'. Following Rowland Hassall's death at Parramatta in 1820, his son, Samuel Otoo, inherited the Macquarie Grove property and occupied the farmhouse (now Hassall Cottage) with his wife Lucy Mileham and family. At this time, Macquarie Grove was the most established and valuable property owned by Rowland Hassall and Samuel continued to run the property as his father had done. With the development of the farm and the formal establishment of the Camden township in 1840, Otoo's son James Mileham Hassall constructed a larger homestead on the property to the south-west of the original farmhouse. The new homestead was called \\"Macquarie Grove\\" and the farmhouse renamed \\"Lucyville\\". Following Samuel's early passing at aged 33, Lucy remarried and moved away from the property, only returning in the late 1840s to occupy Lucyville following the death of her second husband. Also at this time, Mileham Hassall, was occupying the Macquarie Grove homestead with his family but, following the damaging floods of the 1860s, James moved his family and leased the property to the schoolmaster William Gordon for its use as a boy's school. As the Hassall family fortune dwindled, James sold the Macquarie Grove property (and both cottages) to Henry Carey Dangar MLC, the prominent pastoralist, property owner and racing enthusiast in 1877. Macquarie Grove was not intended to be a commercial venture for Dangar but rather to become the family's summer retreat for three months each year and also the produce provider for their Sydney home. As well as producing butter, eggs and poultry, the farm also provided for the farm stock and the retired race and carriage horses that grazed the property. At this time, a portion of the Macquarie Grove property was used as a rifle range by the Rifle Club of Camden. A horse track was also established to the rear of the cottages. Macquarie Grove was to have a number of short- term owners after the Dangar period (from James White MLC MLA to Henry Lamont Mackellar in 1896; to David James Maxwell in 1900; to Percy Crossing in 1907; and to James Pritchard in 1913). Finally, Macquarie Grove was purchased by Arthur Macarthur-Onslow (great grandson of the district's pioneer John Macarthur) in 1916 who used the property as a sheep farm and as part of the Camden Park Co-operative Dairy scheme. Arthur's second son, Edward, attempted but struggled to maintain the farm as his father had and, in 1937, spurred on by his keen interest in aviation, sold the entire sheep flock and converted the former horse racetrack into a private aerodrome. Edward established the Macquarie Grove Flying School which was used for aviation teaching as well as for recreation and public displays of flying, gliding and parachuting. At the time, Edward had restored The Groom's Cottage, in which he lived with his wife Winifred, using bricks from the derelict stables and had renamed the property \\"April Cottage\\" after the month they had moved in. However, due to an expanding family, Edward and Winifred \\"swapped\\" residences with Edward's mother Sylvia (widow to Arthur) and moved into Macquarie Grove. Upon settling into her new home, Sylvia renamed the house \\"Hassall Cottage\\". Upon completion of a period of initial training, the Macquarie Grove Flying and Glider School was officially opened by the Commonwealth Minister for Civil Aviation, James Fairbairn, on 30 September 1939. As Edward was enlisted for World War II and was due to leave Macquarie Grove, he decided that, rather than close the aerodrome, he would sign a Gentleman's Agreement with Minister Fairbairn (also a personal friend) in 1939 for the government's occupation and use of the property for the duration of the war. To achieve this, a portion of the neighbouring \\"Wivenhoe\\" property was acquired and the runway extended to a length necessary for use by the Commonwealth Government. In 1940, the Crown acquired 468 acres of Macquarie Grove for the purposes of defence and aviation during wartime for wartime activities. The Macarthur-Onslow family was to retain only 15 acres (including Hassall Collage but not Macquarie Grove which was reused as officers' quarters). In late 1942 when the Macarthur-Onslow family returned to the property, No 13 OBU (Operational Base Unit) was firmly established and, after the unfortunate death of Minister Fairbairn in 1940 due to an air crash, any attempts by the family to re-acquire the Macquarie Grove property were in vain. In a final effort, Edward achieved a five-year lease from 1946 in which he was able to re-open the flying school. The Royal Australian Air Force remained at Macquarie Grove for some time after World War II and the cottages were only able to be re-purchased (on small land parcels) by the Macarthur-Onslow family in 1987. The remainder of the 468-acre Macquarie Grove property remains under the ownership of the Commonwealth Government which has established the Camden Airport on the site.  Description  Additional wing Additional wing Overlooking the Nepean River and towards the township of Camden, Macquarie Grove is a picturesque Victorian Rustic Gothic brick cottage residence. Like many Australian versions of the Rustic Gothic style, Macquarie Grove was constructed of brick and stone on a modest scale but with steeply pitched gable roof and highly decorated bargeboards. In keeping with the picturesque style, the house is sited to take full advantage of the aesthetic values of the surrounding natural environment and cultural scenery. The core of the house is a four-roomed cottage which was extended with balanced wings on either end to create an \\"H\\" plan. The added wings were completed in face brick with plastered window dressings, bay windows, elaborate timber bargeboards with finials, Victorian brick chimneys and a decorative Gothic side porch on the western elevation. The gabled roofs are sheeted with corrugated iron. Macquarie Grove is complemented by outbuildings (a cottage residence/nursery and garage/studio) that enclose the rear garden. The property contains a number of significant cultural plantings including an established white cedar tree (Melia azedarach), Common holly tree (Ilex aquifolium) and mature camphor laurel tree (Cinnamomum camphora). It is estimated that the camphor laurel tree dates from the mid-19th century. = Modifications and dates = *Early 1900s - construction of outbuildings (brick servant's quarters and weatherboard nursery) *1940s - outbuildings modified to accommodated aviation defence use and brick garage constructed  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Macquarie Grove is of state heritage significance as part of the Macquarie Grove property, a very early and substantial land grant from Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1812. The property was one of the first allotments granted in the Cowpastures district and Macquarie Grove was the second residence constructed on the property.Hassall Cottage was the original farmhouse built in 1813 Macquarie Grove was, however, the main homestead for the property. Macquarie Grove also has state heritage significance for its association with a number of prominent people and pastoral families. Originally granted by Governor Macquarie to Rowland Hassall, the property was later owned by Henry Carey Dangar MLC and Arthur Macarthur-Onslow. The Macarthur-Onslow family have been long-standing owners of the property and re-purchased portions of the site from the Commonwealth Government in 1987. Macquarie Grove, and the greater Macquarie Grove property, also has associations with the establishment of the Macquarie Grove Flying and Glider School and the operation of the site by the Commonwealth Government as an air-force base during World War II. Following the war, the site has been developed into the Camden Airport. Macquarie Grove was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Macquarie Grove has state heritage significance as part of the Macquarie Grove property. At a substantial , the allotment was a very early land grant in NSW and one of the first granted by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in the Cowpastures district. Allocated to Rowland Hassall in 1812, Macquarie Grove was the second residence constructed on the property. Macquarie Grove was, however, the main homestead for the property. The establishment of the Macquarie Grove property predates the formation of the Camden township. The construction of Macquarie Grove occurred during the same period of the establishment of the township (s). The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Macquarie Grove has state heritage significance for its association with a number of prominent people and pastoral families. The Macquarie Grove property was originally granted by Governor Lachlan Macquarie to Rowland Hassall (a missionary, sheep breeder and later Superintendent of the Cowpastures) who built Macquarie Grove. The cottage was later owned by Henry Carey Dangar MLC (the prominent pastoralist, land owner and racing enthusiast) and finally by Arthur Macarthur-Onslow (great grandson of the district's pioneer John Macarthur). The Macarthur-Onslow family has had an ongoing association with the Macquarie Grove property since the original purchase of the property by Arthur Macarthur-Onslow in 1916. Although the property has been reduced in size by government acquisition of land, the Macarthur-Onslow family does retain ownership of the original farmhouse and homestead on the property. Macquarie Grove, and the greater Macquarie Grove property, also has associations with the establishment of the Macquarie Grove Flying and Glider School and the operation of the site by the Commonwealth Government as an air- force base during World War II. Following the war, the site has been developed into the Camden Airport. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Purposefully sited overlooking the Nepean River towards the township of Camden, Macquarie Grove is a picturesque Victorian Rustic Gothic brick cottage residence. Like many Australian versions of the Rustic Gothic style, Macquarie Grove is positioned in its landscape to take in the aesthetic values of the surrounding natural environment and cultural scenery. Upon visiting the Macquarie Grove property in 1815, Governor Macquarie referred to it as \\"Mr Hassall's finely appointed and beautiful farm\\". The Macquarie Grove property contains a number of significant cultural plantings including an established White Cedar tree (Melia azedarach), Common Holly tree (Ilex aquifolium) and mature Camphor Laurel tree (Cinnamomum camphora). It is estimated that the Camphor Laurel tree dates from the mid-19th century. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. With a longheld use as a private residence, the social significance of Macquarie Grove is limited. However, Macquarie Grove is widely recognised as an early colonial property and has some social significance for the greater Camden district (once the Cowpastures). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As a very early land grant and mid-19th century construction, there is potential for further investigation into the property to reveal new information about its construction and use. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Macquarie Grove is of state heritage significance as a rare surviving example of an early residential homestead built on one of the first allotments granted by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Granted in 1812, the Macquarie Grove property was one of the first large landholdings of the Cowpastures district. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Macquarie Grove is of state heritage significance as a representative example of an early residential homestead, built on one of the first allotments granted by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1812. This period saw the early development and release of landholdings in the Cowpastures district and the Macquarie Grove property reflect the development of the country estates acquired by the wealthy colonists during this period.

It was built from 1827 to 1855 by James Chisholm. It is also known as Buckingham. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006.  History  Gabriel Louis Marie Huon de Kerilleau left France and fled to England during the French Revolution. He joined the New South Wales Corps and arrived in Sydney \\"in the reduced circumstances of a private soldier\\" under the name Gabriel Louis in the 'Surprise'in October 1794 (Carroll, 1983, 31). He was discharged in 1807 and, because of his knowledge of (fluency in) French, became tutor to John Macarthur's sons.Design 5, 2004, 31 Governor Macquarie granted him the 400 acres (162ha) which became 'Buckingham; as from 1 January 1810, and he called it Buckingham after the Marquis of Buckingham, who had some part in arranging his discharge. Huon de Kerilleau employed convicts to quarry stone on the property and start his building programme. Their first project was the small cottage where they were chained each night. Then they went on to the coach house and the servants' quarters. In 1816 Huon de Kerilleau sold the property to James Chisholm for 250 pounds and moved to a new property at Bungonia, near the future site of Goulburn. His son, Paul Huon, became a pioneer in the Wodonga district. James Chisholm renamed the property \\"Gledswood\\", and it was he who, in about 1827, finished the main homestead. Chisholm had been involved in the rum trade in the early days of the colony. He was friendly with John Macarthur, who farmed nearby at Camden Park. They shared an interest in the wine industry, which flourished in the district.Design 5, 2004, 32 Chisholm's son James planted a vineyard in 1830. Vinedressers Frederick and Anna Worner of Wittenberg (Germany) were imported to work the vineyard in 1847. Chisholm once wrote \\"There is much about the vine that renders it an attractive pursuit.\\" The convict built cellar under the main homestead was capable of holding 20,000 bottles.Everett, 2004. Upon receiving a land grant on Cowpastures rural downs in 1829, James and Elizabeth Chisholm built Gledswood in 1830. A large stuccoed rubble stone house was built in the style of an Indian bungalow with an attached kitchen wing and a nearby barn. The property remained in the Chisholm family for the next 90 years. James Chisholm's son, James II (Jas), planted its vineyard . The Macarthurs of Camden Park were friends of the Chisholms and loaned their six German vine dressers to the Chisholms on occasions until the Chisholms imported two other vine dressers of their own in 1847. Frederick and Anna Worner worked the vineyard with their six children. Jas Chisholm and his new wife Elizabeth quickly had Gledswood performing well. Besides the vineyard, they ran a fine herd of cattle and developed many breeds of sheep. Chisholm's wool brought the highest prices on the market. The estate had its own butcher shop, a great orchard and house cows which produced milk and cream. Gledswood comprised 1000 acres by 1850. Jas once wrote \\"there is much about the vine that renders it an attractive pursuit\\". The convict cellar built under the 90 square meter main house was capable of holding 20,000 bottles. James planted the estate's famous garden and his son James II developed them further.Everett, 2003, 4-6 Gledswood was extensively renovated during the c.1870s and was noted for its outstanding garden which was expanded by Charles Kinghorne Chisholm and described in the Horticultural Magazine (1870) in the same year that Maryland was featured. The garden remained a prominent feature of Gledswood and was romanticised by Hardy Wilson . Much like Camden Park Estate, Gledswood has close association with the historical Camden district and for its involvement in pioneering Australia's wool industry. When the Testoni brothers bought the property in 1971 from Anthony Hordern, a condition of sale was that they would re- establish its winery. This has proven very successful and Gledswood does not produce serious quantities in the new millennium.Everett, 2003, 4 The family established of grapes, mainly classical varieties (Traminer, Trebbiano, Semillon, Barbera, Mataro, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Cabernet Savignon). They also established a small herd of cattle for making cheese.Carroll, 1983, 32 In 1972 an area of was subdivided from Gledswood. In 1973 the estate was subdivided roughly in half. In 1976 an area of was transferred to Camden Council. In 1978 an area of was subdivided from Gledswood for the El Caballo Blanco equestrian enterprise.GML, 2017, 5 Gledswood has been developed by the Testoni family as a tourist farm with a reduced farm curtilage. The site is owned by Caldla Pty Ltd. Gledswood is currently open to the public as a colonial working farm with additional activities such as wine tasting, wedding functions and a country restaurant. The house is currently unoccupied but is used for functions. Through the 1980s various changes occurred at Gledswood and new structures were constructed.  Description  =Farm= Gledswood is set on of pastoral land. The Gledswood estate is located off Camden Valley Way south of Raby Road, Catherine Field, across from Raby homestead.SHR item no. 1694 Its rear (the south) of Gledswood abuts the Upper Canal water supply for Sydney.SHR item no. 1373 Gledswood is the first of such early farming properties visible when travelling from Sydney along Camden Valley Way (the former Hume Highway and former Cow Pasture Road). The estate was developed by James Chisholm on land granted to him in 1829. Located in the centre of the property is a selection of Georgian farm buildings. The homestead was built by James Chisholm on land granted in 1829 and later renovated, probably in the 1870s, to include the Gothic verandas and porches; the kitchen has been separated forming a courtyard. The house has a long stone flagged front veranda on the north side with two gables breaking the eavesline and marking the entrances. Decorative features include bargeboards in a rustic pattern, shuttered french doors and a front door with fanlight and side lights. The walls are rendered brick. The current access drive winds through open cleared paddocks and remnant advanced and regrowth woodland. Old woodland remnants such as a group of broad leaved apple trees (Angophora subvelutina) frame entry views to the homestead and the distant araucarias. Old trees in paddocks are in decline and remnants of original woodland are a prominent feature of its landscape. A group of mature Araucarias/ hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii) distant from the road identify the location of the homestead long before any buildings are in view and are definitive of the 19th century landscape character, occurring in association with other typical plant species found throughout the district. =Outbuildings= The kitchen has been separated from the house and forms the courtyard. The outbuildings within the estate include: large cellars; an administration wing; a fine two storey stable building now used as a restaurant'; machinery shed; and other farm buildings such as the decorative wooden hen house. =Garden= Gledswood contains an outstanding \\"wilderness\\" garden, a large formal garden area and many typical 19th century ornamental plantings. Together these combine to create an interesting and intimate series of spaces with views over the surrounding rural landscape. Gledswood's signature plantings of tall Bunya pines remain a landmark from roads and sites in the area. A highly maintained lawn and formal garden in front and adjacent to the house along with pockets of bushland dominated by vines and shrubs now considered weeds, are common thematic elements of 19th century landscapes. Close to the homestead is a variety of wild hedgerow and the front of the administration building, south of the wilderness is dominated by a grove of pepper trees (Schinus molle var.areira), two of which may possibly date from the mid to late 19th century. This species is also scattered throughout the livestock yard and is around the outbuildings and have the same evocative character as the plantings of Belgenny Farm Homestead at Camden South. Further plantings in this area include an old stunted Moreton Bay Fig (Ficus macrophylla). To the south of the building is a black locust /false acacia tree (Robinia pseudoacacia). The northern front to the homestead is in the shape of an expansive ellipse, bounded by a formal gravel driveway with a remnant planting of a lone large white cedar (Melia azedarach var.australasica) on the edge of the driveway. The eastern garden, set out in the gardenesque style, continues this more formal thematic planting. The trees and shrubs in this area are an eclectic mix of species is typical of late 19th century and early 20th century botanical collections. A rose garden has been established east of the homestead and adjacent to this older formal garden. The eastern lawn contains further planting of jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia) and other associated species. The old stunted macadamia nut tree (Macadamia integrifolia) is located south-east of the homestead and is a rare specimen planting in this district.\\"Early Colonial Homes of the Sydney Region 1788 - 1838\\".\\"Camden Significant Tree and Vegetated Landscape Study\\", Volume 3 of 3Morris, C. & Britton, G., \\"Colonial Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain and Camden NSW\\", Volume 2, 2000. = Condition = As at 29 July 2003, Gledswood has been left largely unaltered in design. It has archaeological potential to reviewal evidence of early European farming practices and an understanding of early gardening practices. Gledswood has been left largely unaltered in design although adaptive re-use of the buildings and new plant material has been introduced. = Modifications and dates = *1810 grant to de Kerilleau (former 'Buckingham'). *1815 to north added (acquired by and granted to James Chisholm). *1816extension of Kerilleau grant land to the east and south (acquired by and granted to James Chisholm). *1818extension of land to the south again (former 'Horatio Park') (acquired by and granted to James Chisholm). *1861two acres set up for erection of a school building (closed 1888) *sMajor modifications /renovations to Gledswood homestead with the addition of Gothic verandas and porches and the expansion of existing gardens under James Kinghorne Chisholm. *1881-8land resumed for construction of The Upper Canal across the estate.

Another 10 ha transferred to Camden Council in 1976. In 1978 land on which Gledswood is situated took its present form when over 400ha were subdivided for the El Caballo Blanco enterprise under the ownership of Andalusia Entertainment Centres P/L (for horse shows, tourist attraction). *1970ssubdivision of eastern section (1972, 3, 6, 8) of sections facing Camden Valley Way in eastern part (non-1959 lots). Other modifications have been the adaptive re-use of buildings such as the two storey stables now used as a restaurant. = Further information = HO held discussions with a number of interested parties in 2001 concerning this site. Some of these involved retirement village style development proposals. The property was placed on the market in 2003 and sold around March 2003. Any development proposals would require a heritage impact statement which focuses on how the heritage significance of Gledswood can be retained and conserved while allowing appropriate changes.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 29 July 2003, Gledswood is an early 19th century farm estate that has close associations with the Camden area which is the birthplace of the Australian wool industry. Built by James Chisholm in , Gledswood remained the Chisholm family residence for 90 years. A prominent feature at Gledswood is an outstanding colonial garden that was expanded in 1870. The garden featured in Horticultural Magazine (1870) and was romanticised by Hardy Wilson in 1920. The intense and continual interest in gardening at Gledswood has made Gledswood a prominent contributor to the art of gardening within NSW. Gledswood has historical significance for its association with the early development of Australia's wine industry. James Chisholm junior planted a vineyard in 1830, and in 1847 vinedressers from Germany were imported to work it. A convict built cellar under the homestead was capable of holding 20,000 bottles of wine. Gledswood was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Gledswood Estate was built by James Chisholm c.1830 on land granted to him in 1829 and was upgraded in 1870 to include planned renovations to the buildings and extensions to the gardens that followed within the style of colonial style design. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Gledswood's outstanding 19th century garden was mentioned in the Hoticultural Magazine and by William Hardy Wilson Gledswood remained in the Chisholm family for 90 years and has a strong association with the Camden district.

Gledswood estate has a strong association with the Camden district, much like Camden Park, Gledswood's unique character is recognised by well maintained colonial gardens and buildings that offer a strong historic rural character. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Gledswood has high potential to yield information on colonial settlement within Cowpastures rural downs, and in a wider sense, Camden and Cumberland County. This information combined with other studies within the area will greatly contribute to a better understanding of our cultural history. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Gledswood is a rare example of an early Australian homestead characterised by mid 19th century gardens and ornamental plantings. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Gledswood is representative of early colonial settlement patterns in the Cowpastures rural downs area. Gledswood's colonial gardens is presentative of traditional European influenced landscapes and of 19th and early 20th century interest in botanical collections.

The Arts Square (, Ploshchad Iskusstv) is an open public square in the center of Saint Petersburg, Russia.  History  Before the construction of the Square, the land was the hunting grounds of the Empress Anna of Russia. Then Russian architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli (1700‚Äì1771) created a garden maze on the site. In the early XIXth century, Russian architect Carlo Rossi (1775‚Äì1849) was commissioned to develop the land between the Field of Mars and the Nevsky Prospect. The Mikhailovsky Palace, which now houses the main building of the Russian Museum, stood out as its most prominent building. Rossi also designed the Square, and the facades of the buildings facing Italianskaya Ulitsa and Mikhailovskaya Ulitsa. His work was completed by other architects with the Mikhailovsky Theatre, the Jaquot House, the Saint Petersburg Philharmonia, and the Mikhailovsky Square Garden at its center. From 1834 to 1918, the square was known as the Mikhailovskaya Square (), and as the Lassalle Square () from 1923 to 1952. In 1902, when the Mikhailovsky Palace was turned into the Russian Museum, the eastern wing became the Russian Museum of Ethnography, a new address on Arts Square. In August 1939, Isaak Brodsky died in his apartment on Arts Square, which then became a national museum. SquareOfArts1737.jpgLocation of territory of future square of Arts on the 1737 year map.

Centered around the town green, the district includes churches, schools and municipal buildings, many from the late 19th or early 20th centuries, as well as a diversity of residential architecture. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The town of Naugatuck was settled in the 17th century, and developed primarily as an area of dispersed industrial activity, with saw and gristmills powered by the Naugatuck River and its tributaries. It was incorporated in 1844. Unlike many New England communities, its town center did not form around a church site, but developed around the green, which was donated to the town by an innkeeper in 1831. Two church congregations then moved their buildings there, and it then developed as a civic and business center. Its built infrastructure is dominated by industrial successes of the late 19th century, predominantly in the manufacture of rubber products by Charles Goodyear, and in malleable iron products manufacted by John Whittemore and Bronson Tuttle. Whittemore in particular made many civic contributions, retaining McKim, Mead & White to design no less than eleven civic and private buildings in the town. The historic district encompasses much of the civic and institutional core of downtown Naugatuck. It extends south from the junction of Church, Water, and Meadow Streets, all of which eventually run south, forming spines of the district. Terrace Avenue and Fairview Avenue form the western side of the district, whose southern boundary is an east-west line roughly at Pleasant View Avenue. A finger extends eastward along Cedar Street to include the town's Spanish Revival railroad station. Prominent buildings in the district include the Whittemore Library, a McKim, Mead & White design, the main post office, like the railroad station in a Spanish Revival style, and the Bronson B. Tuttle House, located at the northernmost end of the district; it is a fine brick Victorian mansion, and the only major industrialist's residence to survive in the city.

The series is produced by Yaoyorozu, and premiered from January 9 to March 27, 2019. It follows the survival journey of three sisters in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by mysterious red fog and akamushi, hostile red robot insects. It was the final production by Yaoyorozu before it was dissolved and merged into 8million in 2020. Characters ; : The middle sister of the six sisters, and the protagonist of the series. Her specialties are strong eyesight, speed, and limb regeneration. She wears a rider suit with a white scarf, and has a distinctive ponytail that sticks up. Following the deaths of older sisters Ryoku, Ryo, and Riku, Rin dedicates herself to leading her remaining sisters to safety, and when necessary, sacrifices her own security to ensure their happiness. She is the quietest and most serious of all six sisters, though Ritsu says she used to have a much more cheerful and energetic personality prior to the death of their older sisters. Initially cautious and distrustful of Wakaba, Rin soon grows to respect him for his kindness and willingness to help the sisters. She is oblivious of her growing romantic feelings for him though, and thinks she is poisoned anytime she blushes around him. Her body is a vessel for the Memory Leaf, which becomes key in discovering the source of the sisters' origins and Wakaba's history with the kemurikusa. There are a few differences in Rin's character between the original ONA and the anime adaptation. She is a bit more talkative in the ONA, though she maintains her stoic personality. She is also shown to have very intense memory replays of her sisters' deaths, but this is only briefly mentioned in the anime. In terms of appearance, her eyes are a very light purple color in the ONA and she also wears a long green scarf with her rider suit. The scarf is changed to a short, white scarf in the anime, and her eyes are changed to a magenta color matching her hair. The ONA also depicts her using the powers of the green kemurikusa like a laser to shoot things. She originally had a power that allowed her to see premonitory visions of her sisters' deaths, but this was removed for the anime. : ; : The second protagonist of the series, Wakaba is a mysterious human who suddenly appeared in front of Rin, Ritsu and Rina one day. He wears a white-green shirt and has messy brown hair. He is a very nervous and anxious person, but is also very humble, brave and resourceful. Wakaba has no memory of where he came from or what happened in his past. The sisters originally suspected him of being an advanced humanoid form of the red bug due to his human red blood, however this was debunked when they realized how weak he was. Wakaba accidentally discovers that his special ability is being able to unlock the powers of all the kemurikusa. This interested the sisters, so they allowed him to join them on their journey, though Rin remained skeptical of him for much of the trip. Despite this, Wakaba greatly admires Rin and does what he can to help the sisters, performing selfless acts on multiple occasions to help them fight the red bugs. It is hinted that he has romantic feelings for Rin, though he is also intimidated by her and is careful about being affectionate or giving compliments. When Wakaba unlocks Rin's Memory Leaf, it is discovered that he was a kemurikusa researcher in the past, which is why he is subconsciously able to utilize the leaves in the present. Wakaba was hired to harvest kemurikusa and create buildings and structures from them. He was friends with the First Person, Riri, who accidentally created the red bugs in an attempt to allow Wakaba to have more free time to play with her. His ONA character design is drastically different from his anime counterpart. In the ONA Wakaba has very short hair and wears an oversized white turtleneck sweater with green and grey striped sleeves. While somewhat clumsy and timid in the anime, the ONA depicts Wakaba as having decent reflexes and not being as easily scared. : ; : The older sister of Rin and Rina, and the leader of the trio of sisters. It is unknown if she is actually older in age, as Rin and the Rinas refer to her as the oldest simply because she gained consciousness before them. Ritsu has magenta cat ears matching her wavy magenta hair and wears a miko outfit. Her specialty powers are sound and being able to control the kemurikusa tree to help with fighting and traveling. Her cat ears are able to detach from her body and travel via the kemurikusa tree roots to hear over very long distances. Ritsu discovered the green kemurikusa plant when she woke up, and nurtured it to grow into the strong tree that provides the sisters with green kemurikusa for fighting and healing. As such, she has a very strong bond with the tree and never leaves its side. The tree is connected to a broken cable car, and the roots work as legs to transport the vehicle whenever the sisters travel. She is a bit weaker than the other sisters, having perpetually tired eyes and occasional bouts of coughing. She also does not walk very often, choosing to either remain in the cable car or use the kemurikusa tree roots to help her move. She fights by controlling the strong tree roots during battle. Regardless of her poor health, Ritsu is optimistic, caring, responsible, and level-headed. She leads the sisters in making rational decisions throughout the journey. She is aware of how much Rin sacrifices her happiness for the sisters' sake, and urges Rin to think of herself from time to time. Ritsu is also the first to guess that Rin and Wakaba care a lot for each other. Her anime character design, personality, and powers are drastically different from the ONA. In the ONA, Ritsu has straight pink hair and skin-tone colored cat ears. Her miko outfit is not present, and she instead wears a white and green striped body suit with a black covering on top. She has no health problems in the ONA, and is capable of anger and violence if she feels her loved ones are threatened. When she controls the green kemurikusa tree to fight, it morphs into a pale demonic version of herself with pink glowing eyes. She was also given levitation powers, which was her main mode of transportation. Her personality was originally more playful and slightly dangerous. She was also a bit more cat-like, ending all of her sentences in \\"nya\\" or \\"nyan.\\" This is toned down in the anime, and she only occasionally ends her sentences in \\"nya.\\" As the original ONA took place in a more tech-advanced world than the anime, Ritsu was also depicted as being the most tech-savvy of the sisters. : ; : The youngest sister, who wears a maid costume. Originally a single person, she divides herself into six smaller selves to avoid being injured during battle, each miniature version with their own names and slightly different personalities (Rinaji, Rinayo, Rinacchi, Rinamu, Rinazo and Rinako). In both the anime and ONA, Rinako is killed by a red bug in the first episode, and Rinazo is presumed dead before the start of the anime, but the other Rinas are not affected by these losses and the series continues with the four remaining Rinas. Rina has a very childlike, curious and playful personality. Her specialty power is taste, with the Rinas always scouring for various types of scrap metal to eat and satisfy their large appetites. Eating scrap metal makes the Rinas very strong despite their small size, and they can also manipulate small balls on the ends of their maid dresses to act as weapons or security scouts. They were both apprehensive and curious about Wakaba when he first appeared, wanting to eat him to see how their bodies would be affected. However they quickly warm up to his polite and equally curious personality, though they continue to make fun of his clumsiness and aloofness throughout the series. The Rinas are also aware that Rin and Wakaba have feelings for each other, but they do not mention this until near the end of the series. The anime Rina is largely the same as her ONA counterpart, with the only differences being her height and outfit design. In the ONA, Rina does not look so much like a child and is actually the same height as Rin, though she maintains her childlike personality. Her outfit in the ONA does not have the detachable parts used in the anime, instead having green electricity-powered designs on the skirt. She also wears green and grey striped socks in the ONA, but these are absent in the anime. : ; : One of the older sisters presumed to be dead prior to the start of the series, however Wakaba finds her alive and well on Island 6. She tells Wakaba that she left the sisters to investigate the world and try to figure out the relation between the kemurikusa and akamushi. Riku wears a hooded black dress, a red scarf, and ties her short magenta hair into pigtails. She was known to be the most clumsy and careless among the six sisters, so much that the sisters use her as a reference for Wakaba's clumsiness. Regardless, she is also very brave and adventurous, excavating new areas for her sisters and being a pro at detecting akamushi. Her specialty power is touch, and she is able to read and acquire much information simply by touching living things. Her fighting style is to use the green kemurikusa to manifest electric powers. Like Wakaba, Riku is very interested in finding and learning about kemurikusa. Most likely due to her power of touch, she was the only sister who figured out how to unlock the powers of the various kemurikusa, and teaches Wakaba many of these tricks when she meets him. Riku's ONA character and design is drastically different from her anime counterpart. In the ONA, she wears a full black bodysuit, pink mary janes, and ties her pink hair in six braided pigtails (three on each side of her head). Her teeth are sharp in the ONA, and she is shown to have slightly aggressive behavior when separated from her sisters. ; : The oldest of the six sisters, presumed to be dead when the series begins. She appears near the end of the series on Island 8 to help fight the red bugs. She has magenta hair tied into a single braid, and wears a black sleeveless qipao with magenta embroidery. Her specialty powers are having a strong sense of smell and exceptional strength, though she claims Rin is actually stronger than her. She battles the red bugs using a pipe with kemurikusa tied to the top. Her personality is very easy-going and laid back, though she loves to fight and gets very excited just by the thought of it. However, she is also a bit of a pacifist, and used to urge the sisters to fight with their own skills rather than relying on the green kemurikusa. She admits to Wakaba that she is actually dying due to some permanent weakness after fighting Nushi, extremely large and hostile versions of the red bugs. Ryo was the original vessel for the Memory Leaf, but later transferred the leaf to Rin to help her get stronger. After this, she began sharing bodies with her sister Ryoku to conserve energy. ; : The youngest sister with glasses and long hair. her hair looks like medusa's snakey head and her forked 4 spoon hair has one eye on them head. She has the ability to share bodies with Ryo. ; A small, benevolent white bug that is loyal to Wakaba and assists the sisters on their journey. ; ; Media =ONA= The series was originally released as a two-part original net animation (ONA) between 2010 and 2012.

Occupied for more than 90 years by the Davies family, the garden has been little altered from its inception until recent times, while the house has organically evolved over time with pavilion additions and enclosed verandas. Long-time custodian of the house and garden, Miss Llewella Davies, OAM was recognised for her services to the Camden community with a key to the town in 1999. Nant Gwylan maintains a visual relationship with the farmland lying opposite, which was associated with the Davies family from 1908 to 2000, and was donated to the town through the will of Miss Davies.Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners, 2004.

Krafft was known for being a pioneer in filming, photographing, and recording volcanoes, often getting within feet of lava flows. She fell in love with volcanoes when she saw pictures of them and redirected her interest in education in geology. Using her love of volcanoes and photography, Krafft established a career as a volcanologist. Her up-close footage and data have been valuable to the study of active volcanoes.  Early career  Katia Conrad attended the University of Strasbourg, France, where she studied geology and met her husband and fellow volcano enthusiast, Maurice Krafft. As an undergraduate, she explored Stromboli, her first erupting volcano, where she collected minerals and gases to gather data. Her career as a volcano observer began soon after. With little money, she saved up for a trip to Stromboli and photographed its near-continuous eruption. Finding that people were interested in this documentation of eruptions, she soon made a career out of filming volcano eruptions, which afforded her the ability to travel the globe. In 1970, she married Maurice Krafft.  Career  Katia started her career by taking gas samples of volcanoes and documenting eruptions by observing them in person. To fund her trips, Katia wrote many books about her findings, pioneering a new area of volcanic coverage. She also made a documentary, \\"The Volcano Watchers\\", for the PBS show \\"Nature\\". On January 23, 1973, Katia was called to Southern Iceland to study an extinct volcano that had suddenly erupted after thousands of years of inactivity. Since volcanoes are unpredictable and dangerous, many scientists were afraid to observe eruptions in person. Katia, however, would go right to the edge of a volcano. Her fearlessness and up-close documentation led to her fame and success as a volcanologist. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Katia continued to document volcanoes through photography while her husband, Maurice, captured them on video. Katia's observations have led to a better understanding of volcanic eruptions. She took measurements, gas readings, and collected mineral samples just feet away from erupting volcanoes and documented how these eruptions affected the ecosystem. She witnessed and documented new volcanoes being formed and the effects of acid rain and dangerous ash clouds. One of her last projects was Understanding Volcanic Hazards and Reducing Volcanic Risks. Katia continued to push the boundaries to get her observations, wearing a special helmet to protect herself from falling rock to and taking a raft into a lake of acid to get proper readings. The Kraffts were often the first to be at an active volcano, and were respected and envied by many volcanologists. Her photography allowed her to work with local governments on safety procedures and helping to develop volcano evacuation procedures. Their footage of the effects of volcanic eruptions was a considerable factor in gaining the cooperation of local authorities who were faced with volcanic threats. One notable example of this was after the onset of activity at Mount Pinatubo in 1991, where their video of the effects of the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia was shown to large numbers of people, including Philippine President Cory Aquino. This video convinced many skeptics that evacuation of the area would be necessary.. In 1969, Katia was awarded the prize of the Vocation Foundation for her first work of volcanology on active sites.  Death by Mount Unzen eruption  In June 1991, while filming eruptions at Mount Unzen (Japan), Katia went closer to the volcano and stayed longer during the eruption. Katia and her husband were caught in a pyroclastic flow which unexpectedly swept out of a channel where previously smaller flows had been following and onto the ridge they were standing on. They died along with 41 other scientists and journalists also covering the eruptions, several firefighters, and fellow volcanologist Harry Glicken.  The Maurice and Katia Krafft Crater  A volcanic crater, M. and K. Krafft Crater, of the volcano Piton de la Fournaise on the island of Reunion, is named after the couple. The crater is located at . Lava erupted from this crater in March 1998.  The Maurice and Katia Krafft Memorial Fund  The Centre for the Study of Active Volcanoes at the University of Hawaii at Hilo has established a fund in memory of the Krafft's (The Maurice and Katia Krafft Memorial Fund). The donations will be directed to educate people in countries of high volcanic risk about the hazards active volcanoes pose.

Scale bar is 10 ¬µm Eduard Eidam first described H√ºlle cells in 1883 where he termed H√ºlle cells as a ‚ÄúBlasenh√ºlle‚Äù or bubble envelope (Eidam 1883). In different species, H√ºlle cell like structures are known such as in Candida albicans which produce at the very end of the hyphae globose blisters named chlamydospores (Navarathna et al., 2016). Eidam suggested that H√ºlle cells originate from the tip of ‚Äúsecondary hyphae‚Äù which in turn emerge from ‚Äúprimary hyphae‚Äù and develop as a consequence of a swelling process. H√ºlle cells and the subtending hyphae are connected via two distinct types of septa. The inner one is a single perforate septum where woronin bodies can be observed and represents a typical ascomycetous septum. The second septum which separates H√ºlle cells from the subtending hyphae is unique and named basal septum. At the basal septum vesicle fusion is observable. Consequently, to this fusion so called lomasome- like accumulations are visible. These lomasome-like structures are membrane- invaginations. In H√ºlle cells several nuclei, mitochondria, lipid bodies and storage products can be observed (Ellis et al., 1973). During initial H√ºlle cell formation, it was shown that several nuclei fuse to form a marcronucleus (Carvalho et al., 2002). Different species of the genus Aspergillus produce H√ºlle cells, including Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus heterothallicus (Bayram and Braus 2012). H√ºlle cells have an average size of 12-20 Œºm, are of globose shape with an unusual thick cell wall and are mainly associated with the sexual developmental program. H√ºlle cells are known for all species in the section Nidulantes. In different species, H√ºlle cells vary in shape between the more elongated such as in Aspergillus ustus and the globose version like in Aspergillus nidulans. In Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus heterothallicus H√ºlle cells associate with the cleistothecia, whereas in Aspergillus protuberus and Aspergillus ustus H√ºlle cells are not in direct contact with the cleistothecia and are formed in masses (Muntanjola-Cvetkovic and Vukic).

When founded in 1923, its name was the Nelson Street Sfardish Synagogue. It has \\"an unassuming exterior and a stunningly beautiful interior\\". History In the early twentieth century, the East End was a new centre of Jewish life in England: in the compact area there was a population of around 250,000 Jews. Mostly they were Yiddish-speaking first-generation immigrants from Eastern Europe, unlike the established Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities in Britain, which in the main had come from the Low Countries. Serving this community were about 150 synagogues. As a consequence of the Second World War, which saw the East End heavily bombed, this population moved on to new Jewish centres in North and Northwest London such as those in Stamford Hill, Golders Green and Hendon, and the congregations of the East End synagogues consolidated. Just three synagogues now remain in the area, the Nelson Street Synagogue the only one purpose-built. About twenty neighbouring synagogues were amalgamated with it over the years, including: Belz, Berditchever, Buross Street, Cannon Street Road, Chevra Shas, Commercial Road Great, Grove Street, Jubilee Street, Mile End, New Road, Philpot Street Great, Philpot Street Sphardish, Rumanian Sidney Street, and Sons of Britchan (B'nai Brichtan). As a consequence of these amalgamations the shul has a large collection of Torah scrolls, some dating back to the 18th century, many of now unknown origin. Architecture In his second volume on London, published in 1951, the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner recorded that the synagogue was built by Lewis Solomon and Son, and described it thus: \\"Discreet brick exterior with two tiers of windows beneath round-headed arches with stone keystones. Fine classical interior. Galleries with iron railings between Ionic columns; coved steps, framed by a Venetian arch on Doric columns. Above the Ark, scrolled pediment with tablets of the law and Lions of Judah. Panelled pews and Bimah\\". Lewis Solomon (1848‚Äì1928) had built several synagogues, and served as both the Federation of Synagogues' Honorary Architect and also the United Synagogue's Architect and Surveyor. By 1923 his practice was being run by his son Digby Lewis Solomon (1884‚Äì1962). Lewis Solomon and Son had, two years earlier, redesigned the premises occupied by the neighbouring Congregation of Jacob synagogue on Commercial Road, which also still survives. Modern existence The shul belongs to the Orthodox Federation of Synagogues. The term \\"Sfardish\\" in the original name indicates that the shul, while Ashkenazi, follows Nusach Sefard, a prayer liturgy influenced by the Rabbi Isaac Luria's attempts to reconcile the Ashkenazi and Sephardi liturgies. The East End now has a very considerable Muslim population, with which the shul actively maintains interfaith relations through the Tower Hamlets Inter Faith Forum, of which the large East London Mosque on Whitechapel Road is also a member. The building is also regularly visited by historical societies and walking tours, and has in the past participated in Open House London. The architect Maxwell Hutchinson has drawn up a plan for adding museum and library space, so that the shul could increase its standing as a tourist destination and allow it to become a historic Jewish centre. Funding for this plan is in the process of being sought. In January 2018 there was a march to the synagogue from Aldgate to commemorate the East End's Jewish heritage, followed by a multi-faith service of remembrance in which the Deputy Mayor of Tower Hamlets took part.

The family received another chance at their own series on We TV with Mama June: From Not to Hot, which chronicled June's weight loss following bariatric surgery, but the fate of that show currently hangs in the balance as June and her longtime partner, Eugene \\"Geno\\" Doak, were arrested in March 2019 for felony drug possession.  The Shannons  = June Shannon = June Edith \\"Mama June\\" Shannon (born August 10, 1979) is the matriarch of the Shannon family, the mother of Anna, Jessica, Lauryn, and Alana. She was born in McIntyre, Georgia to Sandra Hundley and Marvin Shannon, who divorced when she was two. She has three siblings: Joanne \\"Doe Doe\\" Shannon, Joanie Shannon (now McDonald) and James Edward Shannon; and two half-sisters, Michelle Shannon and Nicole Shannon. Due to childhood cataracts that went untreated, June is legally blind. June became pregnant with her first daughter, Anna, at 14 and gave birth just days after her 15th birthday. She dropped out of school when she became pregnant, but she later earned her GED. June pursued relationships with men who would later become convicted sex offenders; her daughters Jessica and Lauryn were fathered by Michael Anthony Ford (b. 1977), who was found guilty of trying to exploit oral sex from a minor female online; and she briefly dated Mark McDaniel, who was convicted of abusing Anna and whom Lauryn believed to be her biological father for some time. Her youngest daughter, Alana, was born in 2005, fathered by Mike Thompson, from whom June split in 2014. She came out as bisexual, alongside Lauryn, in 2015, saying she had been intimate with women but had never been in a relationship with a woman. As an adult, June struggled with being morbidly obese, weighing 460 pounds at her heaviest. She subsequently underwent bariatric surgery, having part of her stomach removed as part of a sleeve gastrectomy, in 2016 and reportedly lost more than 300 pounds thanks to the surgery as well as the help of dieting and personal trainer, Kenya Crooks. In addition to her significant weight loss, she underwent cosmetic surgery, spending a reported $75,000 to further improve her appearance. Her weight loss journey was the basis for the reality TV show, Mama June: From Not to Hot, which aired on We TV on February 24, 2017. A second season premiered on January 5, 2018. She is currently in a relationship with Geno Doak. Doak has a criminal record, having served jail time for burglary, theft, and criminal damage to property and in March 2019, they were both arrested for felony drug possession in Alabama. She currently resides in Hampton, Georgia. = Anna Cardwell = Anna Marie \\"Chickadee\\" Cardwell (nee Shannon; born August 28, 1994) is the eldest of June's four children; her father is David Dunn. Because June was so young when Anna was born, having just turned 15 before she gave birth, she initially considered placing Anna for adoption by her aunt and uncle, Janice and James Shannon, but the paperwork was never finalized and Anna ultimately ended up being raised by her maternal grandmother, Sandra. While in June's custody, Anna was sexually abused by June's then-boyfriend, Mark McDaniel, who was later convicted for his crimes. Like her mother, Anna became pregnant as a teenager and gave birth to her first child, daughter Kaitlyn Elizabeth, in 2012. Kaitlyn has the surname Clark, after Anna's longtime boyfriend Caleb Clark, but Anna has never publicly named Kaitlyn's father; she has only said that they haven't spoken since Kaitlyn was two months old and that he was engaged with two children. She and Clark eventually broke up and Anna went onto marry Michael Cardwell (b. 1992). The two wed on May 25, 2014 and moved to Alabama, where their daughter Kylee Madison was born in 2015. Anna and Michael separated in 2017 and Anna returned to Georgia with her two children. Anna has had a strained relationship with June, as June defended McDaniel in regards to accusations that he sexually assaulted her and reportedly began dating McDaniel again in 2014. Additionally, Anna alleged that June had stolen thousands out of her trust fund, leaving her with less than $18 in her savings account. During the time Anna involved lawyers in an effort to gain access to her accounts, which were managed by June, she took to social media in an effort to make money selling products that claimed to prevent Ebola, in the midst of the Ebola epidemic in the United States, which subjected her to backlash. = Jessica Shannon = Jessica Louise \\"Chubbs\\" Shannon (born October 12, 1996) is June's second daughter; her father is Michael Anthony Ford. She shares a father with her younger sister Lauryn, though Lauryn was raised believing that Mark McDaniel was her biological father. When the family moved from McIntyre, Georgia to Hampton, Georgia, 17-year-old Jessica didn't accompany them, as she had less than three months until her high school graduation. = Lauryn Efird = Lauryn Michelle \\"Pumpkin\\" Efird (nee Shannon; born January 7, 2000) is June's third daughter and her second by Michael Anthony Ford, a convicted sex offender. Lauryn was raised believing her father was Mark McDaniel, a former partner of June's who was convicted for sexually abusing Anna. She has daughter Ella Grace with Joshua Efird. At the age of six, Lauryn was struck by lightning. In 2018, she stated that she wished she'd waited until she was older to have children and that it hadn't been her intention to become a teen mother. Lauryn came out as bisexual, alongside June, in 2015. She married Joshua Efird, the father of her daughter Ella, in April 2018, in Las Vegas, Nevada. = Alana Thompson = Alana Frances \\"Honey Boo Boo\\" Thompson (born August 28, 2005) is the fourth and youngest of June's daughters; her father is June's former longtime partner Mike \\"Sugar Bear\\" Thompson. Alana began to compete in beauty pageants at a young age, which earned her screen time on the popular TLC television show Toddlers & Tiaras that gave viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the world of pageantry. A popular member of the cast, she and her family were given their own show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which was ultimately cancelled due to her mother's association with sex offender Mark McDaniel. Alana currently maintains an Instagram account and appeared on her mother's reality television show, Mama June: From Not to Hot. In October 2018, it was confirmed that Alana would be a contestant on Dancing with the Stars: Juniors, paired with Tristan Ianiero and mentored by Artem Chigvintsev. It's been reported that Alana was paid $50,000 to appear on the show and would earn an additional $80,000 if she remained on the show for the entirety of the season and competed in the finale episode. She was eliminated in the fourth week. As of Fall 2019, Alana was rarely in contact with her mother. After her mother's crack cocaine arrest, Alana now lives with her 20-year old half-sister, Lauryn \\"Pumpkin\\" Shannon who also obtained legal guardianship of Alana. = Kaitlyn Clark = Kaitlyn Elizabeth Clark (born July 26, 2012) is the eldest of Anna's two children, born to Anna when she was 17 years old. She weighed 6 lbs, 2 oz at the time of her birth and her birth was featured on Season 1 of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Though Anna's high school sweetheart, Caleb Clark, whom Anna dated for two years, has said he believes himself to be Kaitlyn's father, Anna and her family expressed doubts as she had been intimately involved with a second man around the time she became pregnant. Neither Caleb nor the other man appear to publicly have a relationship with Kaitlyn and, after Anna wed Michael Cardwell, Kaitlyn reportedly began calling her stepfather \\"Daddy.\\" Her half- sister, Kylee, was born when she was 3 years old. Notably, Kaitlyn was born with polydactyly, sporting a second thumb on her right hand; she later underwent surgery to remove her extra thumb, amidst Anna's concerns that her daughter would be bullied for her condition. After her mother and step-father separated in 2017, Kaitlyn moved with her mother and half-sister from Alabama, where she'd been living since the age of 2, to Georgia. = Kylee Cardwell = Kylee Madison Cardwell (born December 9, 2015) is the youngest of Anna's two children, born to Anna and her then-husband, Michael Cardwell, when Anna was 21 years old. Her middle name, Madison, honors her paternal grandmother. = Ella Efird = Ella Grace Efird (born December 8, 2017) is Lauryn's only child; Lauryn was 17 when she welcomed her with husband Joshua Efird. Her family currently maintains an Instagram account for her, which had 92,600 followers as of May 2020. Her parents wed in 2018, when she was 4 months old.  Associates of the Shannons  = Mike Thompson = Mike \\"Sugar Bear\\" Thompson is the ex-partner of June and father of Alana. He is currently married to Jennifer Thompson (nee Lamb). Mike later revealed he'd been unfaithful to June, having cheated on her with both men and women during the course of their relationship, on an episode of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars. Jennifer expressed she had doubts as to whether Mike was the biological father of Alana and, without Mike's knowledge, submitted his DNA for a paternity test; the results were inconclusive, with the report saying the samples submitted had been corrupted. Mike told the press that after he and June separated, she'd been keeping Alana from seeing him. = Jennifer Thompson = Jennifer Thompson (nee Lamb) is the wife of Mike Thompson. She was previously married to Raymond Lamb, Jr., a former truck driver and convicted sex offender. She wed Lamb in 1994 and in 2014, he was convicted of sexually abusing a minor; he is currently serving a 35-year sentence at Wheeler Correctional Facility. It was reported that Jennifer was considering weight loss surgery, as her obesity was causing her mobility issues, but said that she was hesitant to undergo the surgery for fear her husband would leave her if she did, as Mike prefers larger women. She ultimately lost a substantial amount of weight and in 2019, she and Mike were still together, with Mike proposing to her a second time with a new diamond wedding ring. = Lee Thompson = Lee \\"Uncle Poodle\\" Thompson is Mike's brother, Alana's paternal uncle. He is openly gay and HIV-positive. He suffered from heart trouble in 2015, leading him to incur $150,000 in hospital bills. = Michael Ford = Michael Anthony Ford (born 1977) is the father of Jessica and Lauryn. He was convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor, after attempting to solicit oral sex from an undercover police officer he believed to be a teen girl. His arrest was featured on an episode of To Catch a Predator. Michael is currently incarcerated and ineligible for parole until 2026, after he was found to have violated his probation. = Eugene Doak = Eugene Edward \\"Geno\\" Doak (born October 8, 1975) is June's current romantic partner. The two began dating in 2017. Geno has a criminal history, including felony charges, for which he served time at Coastal State Prison. In 2009, he was admitted to a psychiatric facility following a suicide attempt. After being released from prison, Geno founded his own home improvement company, G&J; Home Improvements, which is based in Griffin, Georgia. Additionally, he is divorced and has children of his own from previous relationships and the two previously dated for a brief time in 2015. He, along with June, was arrested in March 2019 for drug possession in Alabama. = Mark McDaniel = Mark McDaniel is June's ex- partner and possibly the father of her third child, Lauryn. Mark pled guilty to aggravated child molestation in 2003, with June's eldest daughter, Anna, being his victim. June reportedly rekindled her relationship with Mark after his release from prison, resulting in the cancellation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, though June denied any wrongdoing.  TV appearances  = Toddlers & Tiaras = The Shannons were first introduced to U.S. audiences through their appearances on TLC's Toddlers & Tiaras. June and Alana first appeared together in an episode titled Precious Moments Pageant 2011, which originally aired on January 4, 2012, though filming for the episode took place in 2011. The mother-daughter duo became regulars on the show, which gave viewers a behind- the-scenes look at the world of pageantry. Alana's outgoing personality and funny remarks made her a fan favorite and several of her phrases from the show, such as \\"A dollar makes me holler,\\" later became the basis for popular internet memes. Audiences later expressed concern for Alana's health after it was revealed that June would give her daughter, then 6 years old, a mixture of soft drinks and energy drinks to give her enough energy to compete in pageants. =Here Comes Honey Boo Boo= Here Comes Honey Boo Boo premiered on TLC on August 8, 2012, which ran for four seasons, featuring the family and their daily lives. In the middle of filming the fifth season, TLC abruptly cancelled the show after it was confirmed June was dating a registered sex offender. = Dr. Phil = In December 2014, Anna appeared on an episode of Dr. Phil, alongside her grandmother, Sandra, to discuss the disappearance of money from her savings account, which June had access to, and the backlash she received as the result of endorsing products claiming to treat the Ebola virus and cancer.Dr. Phil, The \\"Honey Boo Boo Scandal\\": Chickadee and Grandma Set the Record Straight, Season 13, Episode 68, Aired December 11, 2014 = The Doctors = In 2015, Alana and June appeared on an episode of The Doctors, who urged June to take control of Alana's weight, which had reached 125 pounds, making Alana clinically obese. = Mama June: From Not to Hot = Mama June: From Not to Hot premiered on We TV on February 24, 2017. A second season aired the following year. = Dancing with the Stars: Juniors = Alana is set to appear on Dancing with the Stars: Juniors, a spin-off of Dancing with the Stars that will feature child stars and dancers.  Controversies  = Go-go juice = During their time on Toddlers & Tiaras, June was filmed giving Alana, who was then 6 years old, a drink she referred to as \\"go-go juice.\\" Later on, it was revealed that the go-go juice she had Alana consume before pageants was a mixture of Red Bull, an energy drink, and Mountain Dew, a carbonated beverage high in caffeine, sugar, and calories. Experts estimated that one serving of go-go juice contains as much caffeine as two cups of coffee, a worrisome amount considering that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children under the age of 12 not consume caffeine at all. June defended her decision to give the Red Bull-Mountain Dew mixture to Alana, saying that there were worse things she could give her daughter to drink, such as alcohol, and that she'd tried alternatives, notably Pixy Stix, which are referred to as \\"pageant crack\\" within the pageant community due to the energizing effects the high sugar content has on a child contestant's behavior. = June's relationship with a sex offender = At the height of the family's popularity and in the middle of filming what would be the last season of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, June was rumored by tabloids to have rekindled her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, convicted sex offender Mark McDaniel. To make matters worse, Anna revealed to the media that Mark had sexually abused her and that after police began their investigation into Anna's claims, June didn't believe her. The scandal ultimately resulted in TLC canceling the show. = June's drug addiction = On March 13, 2019, June Shannon and her boyfriend, Geno Doak, were both arrested at a gas station in Alabama, after police were called to the scene following reports of a public dispute. Both June and Geno were arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance, reportedly crack cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia, with a glass pipe found on June and a hypodermic needle found on Geno. Geno also faced an additional charge of domestic violence and harassment in relation to the public altercation with June. The two were indicted on felony charges related to drug possession and Doak with third-degree domestic violence on September 13, 2019, though later reports do not mention a needle being found in Geno's possession, only the pipe, which June reportedly told police belonged to her. The two failed to show for their indictment, but later, in October 2019, entered a plea of not guilty, and face the possibility of prison time, if convicted. June's family reportedly staged an intervention and were able to convince June to enter a drug rehabilitation program in North Carolina several days prior to her arrest in Alabama, though she stayed in the program just twelve hours before checking herself out. Since her arrest, her daughter Lauryn, also known as Pumpkin, has had custody of June's youngest daughter, Alana, also known as Honey Boo Boo, and June has had limited contact with both of them.

He had strong dissenting religious views which sustained his militancy against the Jacobite rebellions. Hoghton Tower, Lancashire - the Hoghton family seat Hoghton was the second, but eldest surviving son of Sir Charles Hoghton, 4th Baronet and his wife Mary Skeffington, daughter of John Skeffington, 2nd Viscount Masserene. The family had a strong non-conformist tradition, to which he adhered and went on to found many dissenting chapels. In 1695 he was admitted at Middle Temple. He succeeded to the baronetcy and estates on the death of his father on 10 June 1710. Hoghton became a Freeman of Preston in 1682 and a burgess of Wigan in 1710. He was Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire and Colonel of the militia. At the 1710 general election he was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Preston, but lost the seat in 1713. He was returned unopposed for Preston at the 1715 general election. During the Jacobite rebellion Hoghton was active in attending to the defence of the county. His house in Preston was occupied by both sides during the conflict. In the aftermath, he was appointed in 1716 as one of the Commissioners for forfeited estates. At the 1722 general election he stood for Lancashire instead of Preston, but was defeated. After an unsuccessful attempt at Kingston-upon-Hull in 1724 he was brought in by the government as MP for East Looe at a by- election on 17 February 1724. He was returned unopposed at Preston at the 1727 general election and again in 1734. In 1734 he was appointed judge-advocate- general by Walpole. He was defeated at Preston at the 1741 general election and resigned his post. At the time of the 45 rebellion he was ready to defend the county but had insufficient resources and took refuge in Yorkshire. As a magistrate after the rebellion he applied the law against Roman Catholics very severely. He was castigated by the government, had his decisions put aside, and threatened with removal from the bench. Hoghton died on 23 February 1768 at the age of 91. He had married three times. Firstly he married Mary Boughton (with ¬£5,000) daughter of Sir William Boughton, 4th Baronet in October 1710. She died in 1720 and he married secondly Lady Elizabeth Russell, widow of Lord.

It is a widely told tale that has been narrated for at least three centuries. These traditions have been widely linked to the Shungwaya origin narrative. However it has been noted that a number of inconsistencies appear in the telling of this narrative.Fadiman, J., When We Began There Were Witchmen, University of California Press, 1994, p.44 online It thus may be, a conflation of two or more peoples origin narratives. Indeed subsequent events in the narrative lead up to the assimilation of two peoples, referred to as Muku-Ngaa and Murutu, both of whom contribute to the present Meru identity. Name The location is commonly referred to as Mbwaa.Fadiman, J., When We Began There Were Witchmen, University of California Press, 1994, p.44 Time period Meru traditions agree that their identity formed on Mbwaa. According to traditions captured by Fadiman (1960's), the last age-set recalled to have lived on Mbwaa were the Ntangi, a period dated to circa 1700. Way of life The way of life practiced on Mbwaa includes practices of both communities. It is presently unclear to whom what pertains. =Trade= In the telling, the people of Mbwaa were traders. They sold ivory to a figure referred to as Mukuna Ruku around whom a body of related folklore has grown. According to certain traditions, this ivory was sourced from a group of people referred to as Nguo Ntuni who lived within small walled villages that were scattered at various points on the mainland and used as trading centers. Mukuna Ruku lived behind a log stockade that the Nguo Ntuni had constructed on the mainland. He had red skin, which he kept covered at all times with cloth, a fact the islanders found odd. Mukuna Ruku is described to have been unique in that he never appeared or spoke to the islanders. Instead, men of Mbwaa left heavy loads of ivory at the narrow gate of the stockade. Then they beat upon a piece of wood that hung nearby (gakuna ruku: to beat a piece of wood) and having drawn attention they withdrew from view. The gate then opened, and Mukuna Ruku took the tusks, leaving prescribed amounts of beads in exchange (\\"placing tucu, marutia , and ngambi (beads) into the horn\\"). He beat the wood once more to attract the islanders' attention, then left. No word was spoken on either side. =Fishing= As told, the economy of the island was based largely on fishing. Men carved small wooden hooks to catch tiny fish along the reefs.Fadiman, J., When We Began There Were Witchmen, University of California Press, 1994, p.20 =Agriculture= Accounts indicate that men of Mbwaa also kept goats, sheep, and short-horned cattle. Through trade they acquired donkeys from a people re- called as Cucu (Somali). The donkeys drew water from shallow wells dug near the island's center. The wells also supported crops of millet and yams, supplemented by sugar cane, bananas, and sap from a palm that was brewed into beer. Conquest & Invasion In all accounts, the people of Mbwaa were conquered by an invading people that appear to have a different way of life. Inconsistencies however are found in the description of the invaders.Fadiman, J., When We Began There Were Witchmen, University of California Press, 1994, p.46 The conquest and invasion traditions contain within them a number of narratives that can and have been tangentially linked to either the Ngaa or Murutu communities. =Ngaa traditions= In some accounts, the invaders arrive in a large sailing vessel that landed on the mainland opposite the islands western shore. Invaders from the ships then crossed the intervening waters on crude wooden rafts. These accounts tend to refer to the invaders as Nguruntune, or red-legs, a term that the Batu speaking peoples used in olden days to refer to non-Africans such as Europeans, Persians and Arabs. Writing on these traditions, Fadiman states... These elements of Fadiman's narrative bear similarity to Os√≥rio's account of The Battle of Brava (1507). This city, present day Barawe in Somalia is located due east/north-east of where the people of Ngaa, who migrated west, would later end up. It is peopled today by the people of Somalia, with whom the people of Ngaa are said to have traded with. Further the general region is Cushitic speaking as the Ngaa (Yaaku) people are thought to have been. All these tangential links would seem to be affirmed by the apparent link between the early Mukunu Ruku narrative and the accounts of the Captaincy of the Malindi coast. Moreover, they are borne out by the remarkable similarity in narratives, set almost two centuries apart. Os√≥rio states that... =Flight= The narratives concerning the flight from Mbwaa, more so those that deal with the immediate escape also bear remarkable similarity to Os√≥rio's account. Fadiman's understanding of the narratives he took lead him to state that in his estimation, \\"...The Nguo Ntuni may originally have come merely to plunder, perhaps attracted by the occasional tusks the islanders brought to trade.\\". here too, the Meru narratives and Fadiman's understanding of them find exceptional congruence in Os√≥rio's narrative; =Murutu traditions= There are narratives that give a picture of an invasion, as opposed to a single instance conflict. In these accounts, the residents did not immediately leave. Rather they refer to invaders who wore a single, red cloth, tied around the waist and at the shoulder, and bound another around their heads. Each carried a short sword of the scimitar type, of which the blade curved backwards and only the outer edge was honed.Fadiman, J., When We Began There Were Witchmen, University of California Press, 1994, p.42-46 These narratives tend to portray a period of submission to the new rulers before which the islanders grew hostile, refusing to herd flocks and till fields as commanded. All these are congruent with present understanding of Shungwaya traditions.

His research focuses on high energy physics, beyond the Standard Model, studying the flavour of elementary particle, charge conjugation parity (CP) symmetry violations, and the Higgs boson. In September 2018, Strumia gave a controversial presentation at CERN's first Workshop on High Energy Theory and Gender, where he claimed that male, not female scientists, were the victims of discrimination on the part of universities.  Education  Strumia obtained his PhD in 1995, at the University of Pisa, where his doctoral advisor was Riccardo Barbieri. His thesis was titled Supersymmetric unification.  Career  Strumia's research specialization is in physics beyond the Standard Model. In 1995, with Riccardo Barbieri and Lawrence J. Hall, he studied flavour and CP violations, present in supersymmetric unified theories even in absence of any flavour or CP violation in the input for the soft-supersymmetry breaking parameters. He is one of the originators of the idea of Minimal Flavor Violation, a proposal to characterize the effects of flavor transitions in new theories of particle physics. In 2004, together with Riccardo Barbieri, Alex Pomarol and Riccardo Rattazzi, Alessandro Strumia laid out a conceptually clear and practically useful framework for the analysis of the combined electroweak precision data of the low- and high-energy phases of the LEP experiments. After the OPERA experiment reported an observation of neutrinos apparently traveling faster than light, Strumia in collaboration with Gian Giudice and Sergey Sibiryakov showed that superluminal neutrinos would imply some anomalies in the velocities of electrons and muons as a result of quantum-mechanical effects. Such anomalies could be already ruled out from existing data on cosmic rays, thus contradicting the OPERA results. After the discovery of the Higgs boson, he computed the probability that the Higgs vacuum undergoes quantum tunnelling, finding that the universe is in a critical state which will eventually end in a cosmic collapse. He joined the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)'s theory division as a fellow in 2000, and as a member of the CMS Collaboration, he was a credited coauthor on the paper which announced the Higgs boson discovery; his primary affiliation was Estonia's National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics. Along with Joseph Lykken and other collaborators, he later proposed the \\"modified naturalness\\" hypothesis for the Higgs boson's mass. While at CERN in June 2018, Strumia and Riccardo Torre worked on a new set of algorithms with which to evaluate the impact of published scientific research. Basing their investigation on PageRank used by Google, they proposed a similar system of ranking scientific papers and authors. Researchers had \\"mixed reaction\\", suggesting that it would be useful for \\"lifetime achievement\\" but possibly subject to \\"transparency issues\\". The \\"simplicity\\" of current methods of evaluation allows for gaming the system. The difference in Strumia and Torres' approach is that they include what they describe as \\"second-generation\\" and later-generation citations in their algorithms. Therefore, not only the original citations of the work are taken into account, but subsequent citations to derivative material also. They named their systems PaperRank and AuthorRank. They also proposed a system called CitationCoin to reduce the effect of groups who \\"inflate\\" each other citation count.  Controversies  = Using pictures of conference slides = Marco Cirelli and Alessandro Strumia were amongst multiple teams that used digital photos from a conference presentation by other authors in 2008 in Stockholm for a subsequent publication. The presentation showed a highly anticipated but yet unpublished measurement of the positron fraction in cosmic rays by the PAMELA collaboration. = Talk on gender discrimination = On 28 September 2018, Strumia gave a presentation at CERN's first Workshop on High Energy Theory and Gender that provoked considerable controversy. Citing an analysis he had performed on data from the InSpire database, he tested the idea that there is a gender bias against women within the academic circles of physics. He claimed that his results suggest that male scientists were victims of discrimination. On 30 September 2018, CERN released a short statement, removed the slides of Strumia's presentation from its conference website and on October 1, suspended him from his \\"invited scientist\\" position, due to a breach of Code of Conduct (naming a CERN employee in the presentation). On 1 October 2018, the University of Pisa released a statement signaling the opening of an ethical investigation. Strumia's talk was condemned in a public letter titled ‚ÄúHigh Energy Physics Community Statement‚Äù on a website called ‚ÄúParticles for Justice‚Äù on 2 October. As of 13 October, it received nearly 4,000 signatures from scientists working in High Energy Physics and related fields, including those of John Ellis, Howard Georgi and David Gross. In response, a rebuttal titled \\"Justice For Strumia\\" was published online along with a petition for reinstatement of Strumia. Subsequently, the petition and the list of \\"2370 signatories from 90 countries\\" were sent to the director general of CERN receiving \\"no response\\". An anonymous commentary on Strumia's talk and the community response was published in Areo magazine. One supporter of Strumia was the former string theorist Lubo≈° Motl. Physicist Sabine Hossenfelder performed an alternative analysis using a different database and found that after accounting for disproportionately higher rates of women leaving the field the sex differences become negligible. On March 7, 2019, CERN confirmed that Strumia's status as guest professor will not be continued. Following this announcement, Strumia uploaded an unofficial recording of the event on a newly started website, where he claimed that his position had been misrepresented in the media. In November 2019, the journal Quantitative Science Studies (QSS) announced it would publish the paper. Despite this acceptance, one member of the QSS editorial board called it \\"methodologically flawed\\" and stated that it \\"fails to meet the standards of the bibliometric community.\\"  See also  * Resistance to diversity efforts in organizations * Variability hypothesis * Women in STEM fields  References   External links    Category:Living people Category:University of Pisa faculty Category:1969 births Category:University of Pisa alumni Category:Italian physicists Category:People associated with CERN ","title":"Alessandro Strumia"},{"id":"58626412","text":"No Love Lost is the seventh studio album by British band The Nightingales.

The film premiered to critical acclaim, and screened in cities and film festivals all over the world, winning numerous awards, including the Special Jury Prize for International Feature at Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. The documentary premiered on PBS stations in USA, on October 15, 2018.  Synopsis  In a vacant New Hampshire farmhouse, a homeless woman's body is found. A diary lies near the body which contains notes of starvation and mental illness. However, this diary also contains beauty, humor, and other positive things along with a spiritual touch. Linda Bishop had been a prisoner of her own mind for about four months, and while waiting for God to save her, she was surviving on apples and rain water, all in the midst of one of the coldest winters on record. The unfolding saga of her story is told from her own perspective, and the perspective of others, describing our systemic failure to protect the homeless and mentally ill.  Production  = Shooting in film: Using historical cameras = The depiction of Linda Bishop's conscious state was shot in film, using 35mm, 16mm, and Super 16mm for different reasons. The filmmakers employed a variety of cameras, including a 1939 Bell & Howell Eyemo (a camera used in WWII war photography) and a 1980s Aaton XTR Prod, each for thematic reasons to underline notions of dreamscapes, personal nostalgia and commercial memory. The filmmakers tried to elevate the visual quality of the film as a way to honor Linda, who was an extremely insightful and visual person. = Shooting in film: Super 16MM = Linda Bishop hid in an attic in the farmhouse, trying to avoid being seen by neighbors, where she found magazines from the 1970s, many of which depicted advertisements for food. Those ads had a certain patina and do not feel like ads from today. The filmmakers tried to echo the nostalgia of the ads and turned to capturing the numerous recipes and food segments in the diary Linda wrote about, shooting those scenes in Super 16mm. When Linda writes about how hungry she is while she is starving and how she is dreaming of a Thanksgiving dinner, the filmmakers wanted to present the imagery of food in both an enticing and dreamy way. They wanted the audience to feel hunger but also feel they were seeing a dream. Many of the food shots were shot in Super 16mm with an Aaton XTR to capture a sense of nostalgia, but also a sense of unease as further enhanced by the graininess of the film. These were images that represented, to a certain extent, a distorted reality of a mentally ill woman yearning for and imagining food, but yearning for food as she imagined it from food commercials she had seen years before when she was more lucid. = Shooting in film: 35MM = When depicting what Linda Bishop may have seen looking outside the window of the farmhouse over the four-month period she was there, or within the room that she died, the filmmakers did not want to use a medium that felt too immediate or hypertransient, so they chose 35mm film, which requires patience and deliberation to compose shots. While in the farmhouse, in a metaphoric sense, Linda lived in a world of film, a world not completely rooted in modernity. There was no electricity or heat, and she spent her time writing in a diary, collecting apples and dreaming, not surfing on the internet. 35mm film image also has an extremely beautiful quality to it, and much of what Linda was looking at outside including rolling fields, a historic barn, lilac branches, a rambling brook, deer and birds, etc. was extremely beautiful. The 1939 Eyemo was used to help map the internal landscapes of the house as well as evoke a sense of memory. One of their Eyemos was also spring-wound which gave the images a sense of uneasiness in its inconsistent exposure uniformity and flicker quality. = Shooting in film: 16MM = When Linda Bishop was released from the state psychiatric hospital, she wandered through various paths in the forest feeling a sense of freedom until she arrived ultimately at the farmhouse. The filmmakers shot these scenes with a 16mm 1966 Bolex and a 16mm 1972 Canon Scoopic. 16mm was ideal to capture the vigor and agitation of her journey from the hospital which was helped by the grain of the film. The filmmakers wanted to free these shoots from any sense of formalism and they openly embraced the streaks of light, soft grainy over-exposed images and lens flares that naturally came with shooting in 16mm. They freed the camera without even looking through the viewfinder. In these 16mm scenes, the viewer does not merely see but actually experiences the act of Linda walking vigorously from the hospital, away out of town and through the forest towards the farmhouse. = Shooting in digital video = The filmmakers conducted many of the interviews in the actual farmhouse where Linda Bishop lived and ultimately died. These interviews were shot in digital video with a Canon C300 to capture the truth of those who came to know Linda over the years and to create a feel of those interviewees being truly present or immediate. They used an Arriflex Alexa in most of the nature shots in the film. Linda lived through one of the worst winters in New Hampshire history. The fall and winter months play a prominent role in the film as Linda struggles through a frozen landscape to attempt to survive longer as she runs out of apples and water. Her desperation in running out of food is mirrored in the desolation of the physical surroundings around her. As she slowly approaches death so does the farmhouse and nature under the weight of winter. The Alexa was stunningly effective in helping us to search for nature's soul in the sun, clouds, snowstorms, icicles hanging from the farmhouse windows and frozen hills throughout this desperate New Hampshire winter. The filmmakers used the Alexa for the eye-of-God shots. = The Technocrane = The filmmakers used a Technocrane with a 60-foot telescopic arm and remote-controlled camera on God Knows Where I Am as well. The extending arm allowed really smooth moves, which helped them evoke both the meditations of a solitary soul and the eye of God moving through the interiors of the farmhouse and landscape with a great sense of precision and composition. Near the end of the film, there is a beam of light in Linda's last room, which reminds viewers of the ‚Äúcamera obscura‚Äù effect when images of memory are pushed or even forced through a tear in the curtain. In addition, the death scene at the end of the film was shot with a Lensbaby. The lens was actually attached to a piece of accordion-like rubber giving the impression of losing consciousness just by moving the optics in and out between one's fingers. =Performance= An early challenge for the filmmakers was how to present Linda's story in her own words. While they had no protagonist to interview, they did have Linda's words, in the form of her diary. Linda's diary was brought vividly to life by actress Lori Singer. Singer spent considerable time with the real diary, even studying how the pen was imprinted onto the actual paper for clues as to what Linda might have been experiencing. Singer created an entire character arc for Linda. The performance helps the viewer enter into the mind of Linda and feel for her, and she serves as the key guide, taking you on what becomes a tragic journey. Singer's performance has been praised by critics across the board. Greg Klymkiw of The Film Corner praised, \\"Singer's performance here is astonishing - she captures the pain, desperation and even small joys in Bishop's life during these sad, lonely days with a sensitivity and grace linked wholly to the \\"character\\" of Bishop.\\"\\" Andrew Parker of Toronto Film Scene said, \\"The actress steps inside Bishop so completely that it‚Äôs impossible not to sit in stunned silence listening to every word of the journals as they‚Äôre delivered.\\" Jessica Kiang of Variety wrote, ‚ÄúA chilling exploration-The diaries are not just read but vocally embodied by Lori Singer in a vivid voiceover performance.‚Äù  Release  The film premiered on April 30, 2016 at the 2016 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. It later opened theatrically in the Spring of 2017 and played in multiple markets around the world. PBS stations will broadcast God Knows Where I Am nationwide on October 15, 2018.  Reception and awards  In 2019, God Knows Where I Am won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lighting Direction and Scenic Design. The film received positive feedback from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 84% based on reviews from 25 critics. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic called the film \\"beautiful, evocative, and ultimately heartbreaking.\\" Andy Webster of The New York Times named God Knows Where I Am a \\"New York Times Critic's Pick.\\" Amy Ellis Nutt of The Washington Post praised the film as \\"remarkably moving.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter said the film was \\"haunting and uncommonly artful.\\" In 2016, God Knows Where I Am won the Special Jury Prize for International Feature at Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. Napa Valley Film Festival awarded the film with the Special Jury Award for Innovative Treatment of a Social Issue in a Documentary Feature. At the Salem Film Fest, God Knows Where I Am won the award for Best Cinematography from American Cinematographer. The film was also named Best Documentary Feature at the Maryland International Film Festival, New Hampshire Film Festival, and American Documentary Film Festival.

From the mythical story of the war of the Pallantidae against Theseus, we learn that the demes of Pallene, Gargettus, and Hagnous were adjacent. When Pallas was marching from Sphettus in the Mesogaea against Athens, he placed a body of his troops in ambush at Gargettus, under the command of his two sons, who were ordered, as soon as he was engaged with the army of Theseus, to march rapidly upon Athens and take the city by surprise, But the stratagem was revealed to Theseus by Leos of Agnus, the herald of Pallas; whereupon Theseus cut to pieces the troops at Gargettus. In consequence of this a lasting enmity followed between the inhabitants of Pallene and Hagnous.Plutarch, Thes. 13; Philochor. ap. Schol. ad Eurip. Hippol. 35. The road from Sphettus to Athens passed through the opening between Mount Pentelicus and Mount Hymettus. A monastery there by the name of Ieraka (or Hieraka) is the site of Gargettus. The proximity of Pallene and Gargettus is indicated by another legend. Pallene was celebrated for its temple of Athena; and we are told that Eurystheus was buried at Gargettus in front of the temple of Athena Pallenis.œÄŒ¨œÅŒøŒπŒ∏Œµ œÄŒ±œÅŒ∏Œ≠ŒΩŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±ŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒØŒ¥ŒøœÇ, Euripides, Heracl. 1031. We know further that Pallene lay on one of the roads from the city to Marathon. Pallene was located near the Byzantine church of St. Stavros. Between the monastery of Ieraka and the small village of Charvati, a celebrated inscription respecting money due to temples was discovered , and which was probably placed in the temple of Athena Pallenis.B√∂ckh, Inscr. n. 76. In Ieraka there was also found the boustrophedon inscription of Aristocles, which probably also came from the same temple.B√∂ckh, n. 23. In one of the churches nearby, George Finlay found the following inscription fragment: ŒûŒïŒüŒ¶ŒëŒùŒóŒ£ Œ†ŒëŒõŒõŒóŒùŒïŒ•Œ£ - XEOPHANES PALLENEUS. This situation, where the roads of the Mesogaea necessarily unite in approaching Athens, is such a point as would be important, and often occupied in military operations; and accordingly, we find that on three occasions in the early history of Athens, Pallene was the scene of action; first, when Eurystheus fought against the Athenians and Heracleidae; again, when Theseus was opposed to the Pallantidae; and a third time when Peisistratus defeated the Alcmaeonidae. The inscription, however, in such a case, is not decisive evidence of location, as material may be moved (see spolia). The neighbouring deme of Hagnous is placed by Ross in the hollow which lies between the extreme northern point of Hymettus and Ieraka. William Martin Leake, on the other hand, fixes it at Markopoulo, in the southern part of the Mesogaea, because Finlay found at this place an inscription, -œÖŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ ·ºàŒ≥ŒΩŒøœçœÉŒπŒøœÇ -ylides of Hagnous.

The history of contacts between the two countries goes back to 1948, the year of the declaration of Burmese independence. Initially, however, Burma under U Nu favored Syngman Rhee's government in the south of Korea. During and after the Korean War, Burma balanced the interest of North and South Korea, taking into consideration the position of China. After the 1975 establishment of diplomatic relations Burma began to shift toward North Korea, which was also nominally socialist and equally wary of Western imperialism. The Rangoon bombing on 9 October 1983 was a turning point in Myanmar‚ÄìNorth Korea relations. Once it found out that North Koreans were behind the attack, Myanmar cut off diplomatic relations and went as far as withdrawing formal recognition of the country. Relations began to recover during the years of the Sunshine Policy when South Korea encouraged the North's rapprochement with Myanmar. Strategic considerations brought Myanmar and North Korea even closer. Myanmar had natural resources that North Korea needed, and North Korea began supplying Myanmar with military technology. Diplomatic relations were restored on 25 April 2007. Military cooperation between North Korea and Myanmar deepened into cooperation with nuclear issues. Myanmar is believed to operate a nuclear weapons program that seeks to emulate the success of North Korea's nuclear weapons capability. The program is supported by North Korean training and equipment. Although the 2011‚Äì2015 Myanmar political reforms have led to the cancellation or downgrading of military ties, reports on suspicious activities have continued . History =Period of good relations= Burma (Myanmar) and North Korea already had some contacts in 1948 when Burma became independent. U Nu's government, however, voted in favor of the motion in the UN that recognized Syngman Rhee's government as the legitimate government over all of Korea. Burma, however, refused to recognize either state and wished to see a peaceful solution to the nascent Korean crisis. After the Korean War broke out, Burma enforced the UN Security Council resolution that labeled North Korea as the aggressor. This perceived \\"anti-communist\\" stance of Burma perplexed many, because Burma was seen as a country with a non-aligned orientation. Burma did, however, not send troops to fight in Korea. When the Korean War escalated and China got involved, Burma with its long border with China, was forced to change its tone. Burma became the only non-communist country along with India not to vote for a motion that recognized China as another aggressor of the Korean War. After the war, Burma began to develop contacts in both Koreas on an unofficial setting. By 1961, there were non- ambassadorial consulates of both Koreas in Burma. Burma established formal diplomatic relations with both Koreas in May 1975, after Ne Win had taken power. During the 1970s and 1980s, North and South Korea were fighting for legitimacy in the international arena. This was also reflected in the countries' relations with Burma when both tried to match each other's outreach efforts. Both would match each other's delegations', friendship groups' and cultural troupes' visits to Burma. For the Burmese, these efforts were seen as a nuisance and a strain on its resources, but it sought to treat both Koreas evenly. Relations with North Korea, however, developed to a more cordial level. Both were nominally socialist states and they shared a suspicion of Western imperialism. Burma and North Korea also cooperated through the Non- Aligned Movement. At the same time, however, North Korea supported Burmese anti-government guerrilla groups, particularly the Communist Party of Burma. It has been alleged that it was personally important for Kim Il-sung to support communist revolutionaries. Alternatively, it has been theorised Kim might have wanted to destabilize the Burmese government to please China for political gain. =Rangoon bombing and aftermath= Ne Win cut off relations with North Korea following the Rangoon bombing in 1983. The Rangoon bombing took place on 9 October 1983 when three North Korean agents placed a bomb in the Martyrs' Mausoleum in Rangoon (Yangon). The bomb killed 21 people, including four cabinet ministers of the President of South Korea, Chun Doo- hwan, who was visiting the country. The president himself narrowly escaped. The authorities of Myanmar hunted down the agents, killing one and capturing two, who were sentenced to death. Ne Win was angered over the embarrassment that faced him and felt personally betrayed by Kim Il-sung. Myanmar expelled North Korean officials, immediately cut off diplomatic relations and formally withdrew its recognition of the North Korean state on 11 November. North Korea conducted another act of state terrorism when its agents planted a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858, which exploded near Myanmar over the Andaman Sea. =Restoration of relations= Relations gradually began improving and during the years of the Sunshine Policy South Korea encouraged their restoration. According to Kanbawza Win: \\"Self-interest has brought the two countries back together[.] North Korea benefited from Burma's natural resources, such as oil, gas and timber while Burma's rulers need access to military equipment, which has been blocked by US and European sanctions.\\" On 25 April 2007, The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) that had risen to power following the 8888 Uprising, finally formally restored the relations. Shwe Mann visited Pyongyang the following year in secret. He is said to have signed a memorandum of understanding about further military cooperation with the two countries. North Korea began to support the SPDC by supplying weapons. These included and small arms ammunition, 130 mm field guns, and ship mounted surface-to-surface missiles. North Korean freighters would frequent the ports of Myanmar and technicians would visit the country, including at the Monkey Point naval facility in Yangon. In Naypyidaw, North Korean military engineers constructed shelters for the Tatmadaw. There were plans to buy a North Korean submarine. These activities caused international alarm. =Cooperation on nuclear issues= Myanmar and North Korea are believed to cooperate on nuclear issues with the goal of a nuclear weapons program of Myanmar. The military of Myanmar was motivated because it \\"couldn't help but notice how North Korea stood up to the US, a harsh critic of the Burmese regime, mainly due to its nuclear program.\\" There is, however, skepticism in the international community regarding the issue because similar accusations concerning Iraq were proven false. In 2003, Myanmar sent 30 officials to North Korea to study reactor technology. Another possibility is that they went to North Korea to train using missiles, which Myanmar wanted to buy from the country but could not afford at that point. The SPDC has contemplated purchasing an entire nuclear reactor from North Korea. In 2006, they started buying from North Korea tools required to construct a reactor. North Korea has bought uranium from Myanmar, which in turn has purchased North Korean equipment for uranium enrichment and plutonium production. North Korean nuclear experts are working in the Tha Beik Kyin area of Myanmar. The North Korean cargo ship MV Bong Hoafan was seen in a port of Myanmar in November 2006. Officially, she was sheltering from a storm, but foreign diplomats were concerned about the ship's presence. Next year, just days after diplomatic relations were restored, another North Korean ship, the Kang Nam 1, arrived at Thilawa Port. She too was said to shelter from a strom, but after two Burmese journalists hired by a Japanese news agency investigated the ship, they were detained. It is possible that the ship was visiting Myanmar in connection to the country's nuclear program. In 2008, the US blocked the flight of an Air Koryo Ilyushin Il-62 from a stopover in Mandalay in Myanmar to Iran, believing it was carrying gyroscopes for missile guidance systems. In January 2009, a weapons specialist from North Korean died in Myanmar while working on a secret project in Meiktila. His remains were quickly repatriated. In June that year, tensions mounted as a US navy ship followed a North Korean vessel near the port of Yangon. Myanmar is relying on North Korea for nuclear cooperation because it is worried about ties with Russia. In the eventuality that its relationship with Russia deteriorates, North Korea will remain an important ally in nuclear matters. China, friendly with both Myanmar and North Korea, has not commented negatively on the possible nuclear cooperation between the two states. With the 2011‚Äì2015 Myanmar political reforms, military ties have been either downgraded or cut. In 2018, however, the UN found that North Korea is selling ballistic and surface-to-air missiles and other weapons to Myanmar through its weapons export arm Korea Mining and Development Trading Corporation. =Myanmar and North Korea in Asia= Condoleezza Rice called both countries \\"outposts of tyranny\\" in 2005. There is a North Korean embassy in Myanmar. Myanmar is one of the top-10 recipients of exports from North Korea. Myanmar‚ÄìNorth Korea relations have affected Myanmar's relations with countries such as the United States and Japan. These countries have supported normalization of relations among themselves and Myanmar so as to deter North Korea from gaining an ally in Southeast Asia. Myanmar and North Korea are often compared to one another. Both neighbor China, both are heavily militarized societies with ongoing conflict, and with isolationist policies. In 2005, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice included both under the term \\"outposts of tyranny\\". Myanmar has, in the words of, Michael Green and Derek Mitchell \\"interest in following the model of North Korea and achieving military autarky by developing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons\\". According to American historian David I. Steinberg, both countries share a trait of nationalism rooter in insecurity and vulnerability. This characteristics explain, for instance, why the two countries, at one point, decide to change their time-zones to deviate from the international norm by half an hour.
