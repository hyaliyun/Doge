The case is a notable precedent because it makes clear that a nominee shareholder is also a legitimate petitioner for unfair prejudice.L Sealy and S Worthington, Sealy's Cases and Materials in Company Law (9th edn OUP 2010) 651; PL Davies, Gower and Davies Principles of Modern Company Law (8th edn Sweet and Maxwell 2008) 683. Facts Brightview Ltd provided internet services. Its shares were in two classes, X and Y shares. Mr Shalson held the majority of X shares through another company called Reedbest Properties Ltd. Atlasview Ltd controlled the majority of Y shares. Brightview's business had faltered after it failed to fulfill an immediate demand to repay a loan of ¬£5.24 million from the X shareholders. An administration order was made. Shortly after, Brightview was sold to another company owned by the X shareholders. Atlasview complained that it (with Y shareholders) had been unfairly prejudiced under Companies Act 1985, section 459 (now s 994 Companies Act 2006). It argued the loan terms left the company so exposed that the X shareholders were able to strip the company's assets for its own benefit and to the exclusion of Y shareholders. Moreover, Atlasview argued that an \\"investment agreement\\" with Mr Shalson was breached when the loan was taken. Mr Shalson and Reedbest argued that Atlasview could not make a claim because it was merely a nominee shareholder and therefore had no economic interest in Brightview, and therefore could not be \\"prejudiced\\". They also argued that Atlasview was attempting to claim losses for the diminution of the Y shares' value, as a result of an alleged breach of director's duty, but they should be barred because this loss was merely reflective of the company's loss. Accordingly, they requested that the claim be struck out as an abuse of process, because Atlasview should have sought redress through opposing the initial administration petition. Judgment Deputy Judge Jonathan Crow held there was no good reason for striking out the petition, except that two of the petitioners who were not members of the company, nor had shares transferred to them by operation of law, should be removed from the petition. He also held that the \\"interests\\" of a nominee shareholder could certainly include the economic and contractual interests of a beneficial owner, and the court had the discretion under s 461 (now s 996) to make an appropriate award. On the reflective loss argument, there was no good reason to prevent a claim for breach of directors' duties, even if they are owed to the company, because the wording of s 994 did not preclude it. Nor did the case law support such a change, since one of the reasons for the unfair prejudice petitition being introduced was to \\"outflank\\" the restrictive procedure for derivative actions. Lastly there was no clear abuse of process, as it may well have been that the administration petition was done too quickly for Atlasview to respond.

He was formerly head of Jaeger and Aquascutum. Until September 2012, Tillman was chair of the British Fashion Council. He is current chair of Common Objective, Fashion Matters, London College of Fashion's fundraising committee and is also a trustee of the V&A.; Early life Tillman was born into a Jewish family and grew up in south London. He was the only child of a Yorkshire-born tailor father who trained at Montague Burton's, and a milliner mother. As his father's business developed, the family moved to Streatham and then Wimbledon, where Tillman went to Balham County Grammar School. Career As his father had been injured in World War II and suffered poor health, Tillman ran the whole family business for extended periods. He left school at 15 to study to be an accountant, before becoming one of the first male students at the London College of Fashion in 1962. Aged 19, on graduation in 1965 he became an apprentice at Lincroft Kilgour in Savile Row, becoming its managing director three years later. Aged 24 he floated Lincroft's on the London Stock Exchange. Tillman developed a business plan based around good design, employing a young Paul Smith; and celebrity, using George Best to promote Lincroft's clothes. Selling out of Lincroft's a multi-millionaire at age 30, he took a tour and brought the concept of the New York City cocktail bar to London, opening Rumours in Covent Garden. Honorbilt Tillman returned to the world of fashion through the purchase of Honorbilt from Austin Reed. With a similar plan to Lincroft's, he floated the organisation on the FTSE. He then used this money to buy two organisations in Hong Kong and California, but the core group was financially unsound, and as Tillman negotiated the expansion the management he left in charge failed to stem the developing crisis. After Honorbilt was refused further bank funding, the board were forced to call in the receiver. The Department of Trade and Industry sent inspectors, who proposed to ban Tillman for life as a director, which he negotiated to a three-year bar: Speaking of the experience, he said: \\"I was virtually wiped out financially. I kept my house by my fingernails. But it taught me a valuable lesson. Now I keep in close touch with everything I do, and if I buy anything I always do due diligence\\". 2000 onwards Tillman rebuilt his fortune through buying and selling UK Yves Saint Laurent distributor Marchpole, then leading the buy out of BMB, a suits wholesaler that supplies Debenhams, Bhs and other retail chains, from William Baird. Tillman returned to prominence with the 2002 majority investment in loss- making Jaeger, which he acquired from Richard Thompson. Tillman teamed up with Belinda Earl. After buying Allders, a large department store in Croydon in 2005, in 2009 the team bought Aquascutum. On 16 April 2012 it was announced that Tillman had sold Jaeger to Jon Moulton's Better Capital for just under ¬£20m with a \\"substantial majority\\" used to settle its debts. Tillman retains 10% of the shares. The following day it was announced that Aquascutum had gone into administration. Tillman retains interests in restaurants, including First Restaurant Group ‚Äì which includes The Waterway and The Clerk & Well ‚Äì created with his son Mitchell Tillman. Tillman was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to the fashion industry in the 2010 Birthday Honours. Charity and community In 2006, Tillman set up a scholarship at LCF, pledging ¬£1 million to sponsor 10 MA students each year. He sits on the board of the Fashion Enterprise Forum, which raises cash for young industry entrepreneurs. Tillman had a five-year spell as chair of the British Fashion Council, a role he took over from Sir Stuart Rose. Tillman is chairman of the Alumni Board for the University of the Arts London.

It was a court of first instance and cases decided here could be appealed to the Frostating Court of Appeal. While the court is named for the neighboring municipality of Inder√∏y, the court was located in the town of Steinkjer. Organization This court had one professional judge (the chief judge) and one deputy judge, plus an administration of five people. In 2006, the court handled 280 criminal cases and 70 civil cases plus summary procedures. History The institution was established in 1635. It is not known where the court met until 1792, when it used the Bj√∏rken Store farm at Sandvollan in Inder√∏y. In 1813 it was moved to the Vika farm at Sakshaug (still in Inder√∏y). In 1856, the court was relocated to Steinkjer, but it is not known where in Steinkjer it was located between 1856 and 1920. In 1920, it moved into offices on Kongensgata on the north side of the town. From 1927 to 1940, it was located in Schiefloeg√•rden on the south side. This was bombed in 1940 during World War II so it was then moved to its official residence on Johan Bojers gate, then again moved to the Langhammer Villa in Tranabakken. Later, it moved into an office at Sannan, where it was until it moved to the Grand Hotel. From 1962 to 1978, the court was located at Ogndalsveien 2, in the offices of Nord-Tr√∏ndelag County Municipality. It was then moved to the head office of Nord-Tr√∏ndelag Elektrisitetsverk until 1988, when it moved to the offices of the County Governor of Nord-Tr√∏ndelag. In 1997, a new, separate building was built for the court, located next door to the County Governor's office. The new courthouse cost . Following the court reform in 2001, it was decided to merge this court with the neighboring Stj√∏r- and Verdal District Court, located in the town of Levanger.

Opened in 1841, it closed in 1965. History Wootton Bassett railway station opened on 30 July 1841, when the Great Western Main Line from London Paddington was extended from Chippenham through the Box Tunnel through to Bristol Temple Meads. It replaced Wootton Bassett Road, about to the east as the station serving Wootton Bassett. The railway was double track with a platform on each side of the line and a small stone building on each. The main offices were on the north side of the line but a goods shed was provided on the south side at the London end of the platform. In 1850, an excursion train collided with a horsebox that had escaped from a siding at the station. Following this accident, the Great Western Railway provided trap points and scotch blocks at all sidings that exited onto running lines. In 1873 a signal box was opened at the west end of the Bristol-bound platform to control trains through the station; until then signals had been worked independently but they were now all able to be interlocked to prevent conflicting moves. A footbridge was provided from 1880 to allow passengers to cross the tracks, but a road bridge was also available at the east end of the station. In June 1874 saw a third rail laid along each track to give a mixed gauge which allowed standard gauge trains to operate through the station, although broad gauge services to Cornwall continued to operate until May 1892. In 1896 an Act of Parliament was passed to allow the GWR to construct a new Bristol and South Wales Direct Railway, which would shorten the distance from London to South Wales by about . t was to commence from a junction a little west of Wootton Bassett station and run to Patchway north of Bristol, from where trains could continue through the Severn Tunnel. The station was rebuilt on the same site, opening on 1 July 1903 to coincide with the opening of the new line, which completed the present day South Wales Main Line. New platforms with brick-built buildings were provided. The main offices and goods yard were in nearly the same places as before. There were now two signal boxes, Wootton Bassett West and Wootton Bassett East, which were brought into use in November 1901 and July 1903 respectively. By the 1930s Wootton Bassett had become a railhead for railway goods traffic to the surrounding district, with the GWR basing a country lorry service here, and a new warehouse was provided to support this. In 1931 a private siding was opened to allow milk trains to service the creamery operated by United Dairies. The Great Western Railway was nationalised to become the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. General goods was withdrawn on 19 May 1964, followed on 4 January 1965 by local passenger services between Swindon and Chippenham. Coal trains continued to serve the goods yard until 4 October 1965. Accidents and incidents On 7 March 2015, a West Coast Railways charter train failed to stop at a signal on the approach to Wootton Bassett Junction, eventually coming to a halt foul of the junction. The train that the signal was protecting had already passed through the junction.Dangerous occurrence at Wootton Bassett junction, Wiltshire Rail Accident Investigation Branch 27 March 2015 Today The station buildings have been demolished but the main approach road on the north side of the line is still clearly visible. A loop line allows up trains (those towards London) from the South Wales Direct line to be moved aside while faster trains overtake them; there is no connection to this loop from the Bristol line. The approach road on the south side gives access to a Foster Yeoman stone distribution depot. The limestone arrives by train from the Mendip Hills and a siding serves the depot, alongside a single- ended siding that lies alongside the main line. The connection for these sidings only link with the line to Chippenham, so the stone trains first pass through the station and continue to {Swindon, where the locomotive runs around to the back of the train and brings it back to Wootton Bassett where it propels it into the siding to discharge its load. Both routes are signalled to allow bi-directional running on each line, although trains keep to left-hand running under normal circumstances. A pair of crossovers between the Bristol lines at Wootton Bassett allows trains to be changed between the left and right hand lines if required. Proposed reopening In February 2011, Wiltshire County Council and Wessex Chamber of Commerce jointly commissioned Network Rail to evaluate construction of a new station at Wootton Bassett to serve the Interface Business Park. The station was to proposed to be built on the site of the previous station and served by First Great Western services from Swindon to Salisbury.New plan to reopen Wootton Bassett rail station Gazette and Herald 28 January 2011Rail issue 664 23 February 2011 page 24 As at September 2019, there had been no further activity.

It is an erect or spreading shrub with densely hairy branches that are more or less square in cross-section, narrow egg-shaped or oblong leaves with the edges rolled under, and deep mauve to purple flowers with maroon dots inside the petal tube. Description Prostanthera galbraithiae is an erect or spreading shrub that typically grows to a height of and has densely hairy branches that are more or less square in cross-section. It has mid-green, narrow egg-shaped or oblong leaves that are aromatic when crushed, long, up to wide and sessile. The flowers are arranged in 8 to 24 leaf axils near the ends of the branchlets, each flower on a pedicel long. The sepals are green on the upper surface, maroon below and form a tube long with two lobes long. The petals are long, deep-mauve to purple with maroon spots in the centre and form a tube long with two lips. The lower lip has three lobes, the central lobe long and wide and the side lobes long and wide. The upper lobe is long and wide. Flowering occurs from September to October. Taxonomy Prostanthera galbraithiae was first formally described by botanist Barry Conn in 1998 in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet is named for Jean Galbraith, a member of the Latrobe Valley Field Naturalists, who co-discovered the species and advocated for its protection. Distribution and habitat Wellington mint-bush occurs on sandy soils over clay on the Gippsland plains in Holey Plains State Park. It is associated with Eucalyptus obliqua woodland with a heathy understorey including species such as Acacia oxycedrus, Epacris impressa, Lepidosperma concavum, Leptospermum myrsinoides and Platylobium obtusangulum. It can become locally common after fire. However, a population at Dutson Downs appears to have become extinct due to overly-frequent fires. Conservation status This species is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to the species include inappropriate fire regimes, firebreak maintenance, herbicide use and competition from bracken fern Pteridium esculentum.

The Cluny is a regular fixture in the top 100 list of World's Best Bars,Top 100 Bars and is currently the only pub in Newcastle upon Tyne to make the list. History The building of 36 Lime Street was completed in 1848, when it was opened as a flax spinning mill. The building was commissioned by Messrs Plummer & Cooke and designed by John Dobson. Lasting just 12 years, it was re-opened in 1860 as a steam-powered flour mill by Henry Proctor & Co. At some point in its history, the building became a Scotch whisky bottling plant called the Cluny, hence the current name. In 1982, Bruvvers Theatre Company purchased the buildingRegeneration and it became an artists‚Äô space.

He is Professor of Pediatrics, Division of Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle. Medical and research career Hans D. Ochs graduated from the University of Freiburg, Germany with a degree and Doctorate in Medicine. He was a resident in Pediatrics at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, at the University of T√ºbingen, Germany and at the University of Washington, Seattle. He received post-graduate training in Biochemistry at the University of T√ºbingen and in clinical Immunology at the University of Washington. He is certified by the American Board of Pediatrics, the American Board of Allergy and Immunology and the German Pediatric Board. Ochs' research focuses on the molecular basis of Primary immunodeficiency diseases with special interest in the genes that have been linked to the Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome, Hyper IgM syndrome, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, IPEX syndrome and autosomal dominante Hyper IgE syndrome. To improve the long- term outcome of these disorders, he has actively participated in clinical trials to develop strategies of immunoglobulin replacement therapies, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and gene therapy. Ochs' clinical interests focus on the use of intravenous and subcutaneous immunoglobulin in patients with antibody deficiencies and the in vivo analysis of antibody production using bacteriophage Phi X 174. He and his collaborators contributed to the identification of several genes associated with Primary immunodeficiency diseases located on the X chromosome, including CD40L, Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome protein, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and FOXP3. Recently, he focused on the gene Uracil-DNA glycosylase, causing a rare form of autosomal recessive Hyper IgM syndrome, and on STAT3, the gene causing autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome if mutated. In 1995, he moved the immunodeficiency clinic from the University to Seattle Children's Hospital, providing diagnostic evaluations and clinical care for both pediatric and adult patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases. He initiated and maintained a successful cooperation with the bone marrow transplant unit of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center since the early 70s and participated in the design of protocols related to stem cell transplantation for patients with SCID, Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, and X-linked hyper-immunoglobulin M syndrome. The Ochs / Torgerson Lab focuses on: * Autoimmunity and immune dysregulation * Regulatory T cells and mutations of FOXP3 * The molecular consequences of heterozygous dominant negative STAT3 mutations and their relationship to autosomal-dominant Hyper IgE syndrome Memberships He serves on committees for the Immune Deficiency Foundation, the Jeffrey Modell Foundation, the US Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET), and the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS).

It is the 4th and 5th episodes in the season's episode count and the 104th and 105th episode of the series overall. The episode was written by executive producer Greg Daniels and Mindy Kaling, and was directed by Paul Feig. It originally aired on October 8, 2009 on NBC in the United States. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The episode revolves around the wedding of Jim and Pam at Niagara Falls. Not all goes smoothly when Jim accidentally reveals Pam's pregnancy to all the guests, including Pam's very old-fashioned grandmother, and Andy injures his scrotum while dancing. Meanwhile, Michael and Dwight both try to hook up with women, with mixed results. The episode was met with positive reviews from critics and fans. Although not all television critics reacted positively to Andy's dancing injury sub-plot, \\"Niagara\\" has nonetheless come to be considered a classic episode of the series. In a poll conducted by OfficeTally at the end of season six, the episode was named the second best episode of the series after the second-season finale, \\"Casino Night.\\" The episode was viewed by 9.42 million households with a 4.8 rating/12% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic making it the second highest viewed episode of the season after \\"The Delivery.\\" Synopsis Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) head up to Niagara Falls for their wedding and the rest of the office follows them. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) seek women to hook up with while Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) pursues Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) meet Pam's sister Penny (Anna Camp), who accidentally offends Oscar by thinking Kevin was his boyfriend Gil. Pam's mother Helene (Linda Purl) is visibly disturbed at the fact that Pam's father and Helene's ex-husband, William (Rick Overton) has come to the wedding with his new girlfriend who is half his own age. Pam's grandmother, \\"Meemaw\\", or \\"Sylvia\\", (played by Peggy Stewart), is a woman of conservative morals, so everyone is told not to mention Pam's pregnancy. At the rehearsal dinner, Jim gives a moving toast to his soon-to-be wife. However, he finishes by saying that everyone but Pam will drink to the toast \\"for obvious reasons\\". Meemaw questions this remark, and after fumbling through several weak excuses Jim finally admits that Pam is pregnant. Michael tries to fix the issue by saying they had \\"lots of consensual sex\\" but ends up embarrassing himself. Meemaw then decides not to attend the wedding out of moral outrage. Michael later visits Meemaw in her hotel room. Despite his indelicate approach to the subject of sex, he establishes an instant rapport with Meemaw and convinces her to attend the wedding. Andy hosts a dance party in his room later that night, with the office staff attending. Andy punctures his scrotum trying to do a split. The guests rouse Pam, the only sober person, to take him to the hospital. Pam reluctantly agrees, but Andy still whines throughout the drive to the hospital. Michael and Dwight try their luck with women at the bar. Dwight, despite embarrassing both of them, is successful in getting Pam's friend Isabel (Kelen Coleman) to spend the night with him. Michael spends the night alone in the ice machine room, having thought the \\"room block\\" at the hotel meant pre-reserved rooms for the wedding guests and not a bulk discounted room rate and thus failed to make a reservation in advance, and couldn't convince anyone else to let him room with them; Dwight, because he failed an honesty test, Stanley, because he brought his mistress and just plain refused, while Toby willingly offered but Michael disgustedly rejected immediately. Prior to the ceremony, Pam accidentally tears her veil and tearfully phones Jim. They meet in private, where Pam expresses shame at her appearance due to being pregnant. Pam is visibly uplifted when Jim cuts his tie in half in an effort to console her, and says she regrets inviting their families and the office staff. They run away from the church together. While everyone in the church wonders where they went, Michael and Helene begin to bond over their failed relationships. Dwight callously rebuffs Isabel's attempts at further contact. The rest of the office staff grow impatient, bickering about their right to take their gifts back. Jim and Pam finally return to the church after an hour with no explanation of their absence, and the ceremony begins. The guests interrupt the ceremony by recreating the dance routines featured in the JK Wedding Entrance Dance. Jim and Pam react with uncharacteristic good humor, having already been married on board the Maid of the Mist IV ferry boat by the ship's captain, below the falls. Jim explains to the camera that he had prepared the ferry marriage in advance after seeing the video, predicting the guests might imitate it. When Kevin leaves his only pair of shoes in the care of hotel staff, the management decides to incinerate them as a health hazard, and he replaces them with Kleenex tissue boxes. The end of the episode shows Kevin soothing his feet in the ice machine. While he speaks to the camera crew, Helene is seen pulling Michael into her hotel room. Production The episode was written by Greg Daniels and Mindy Kaling, who plays Kelly Kapoor on the show, and directed by Paul Feig, his 13th directing credit for the series. The episode was initially assigned to Kaling, but Daniels said he was interested in contributing. The scene in which Jim cuts his tie off took seven takes and was written by Greg Daniels. Cultural references The dance down the church aisle to Chris Brown's \\"Forever\\" is based on the popular 2009 YouTube viral video, \\"JK Wedding Entrance Dance\\",YouTube video of the real wedding Jim and Pam's was based on in which a young couple (JK, standing for \\"Jill and Kevin\\") dance down the aisle to the song along with their wedding party. Pam mentions that the song was specifically put on a \\"Do Not Play List\\", but was choreographed by the wedding guests and office workers regardless.

Background The son of Welsh musician William John Evans, Ivor Leslie Evans received his education at Wycliffe College, Stonehouse before going on to study in France and Germany. While in Germany he was interned in Ruhleben prison for the duration of the First World War. It was here that he learned the Welsh language, and changed his name from Ivor to Ifor. Following the war, and a brief foray into the Swansea coal trade, he went up to St John's College, Cambridge, where he took a first in history and economics. He was subsequently elected the Whewell Scholar of International law. While a Lecturer and Fellow at St John's from 1923 until 1934, he sat on the League of Nations commission reporting on the economic circumstances of Austria, and also served on the staff of The Economist. Principal In 1934, he succeeded Sir Henry Stuart-Jones as Principal of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. During his eighteen years as principal ‚Äì the second longest term to date ‚Äì the College saw many developments. The College debt that he inherited was reduced substantially, and attracted benefactors. It was also during his tenure that plans for building on the Penglais campus were realised: Pantycelyn opened in 1952, and a block in the Penbryn halls is named in his honour.

He can be considered one of the most outstanding Tasmanian batsman of his era, and was unlucky never to be selected to play test cricket for Australia, despite having toured India with an Australian side.http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228743.html Morrisby was the 29th player to captain the Tasmanian first-class team, but was never able to lead them to victory.http://www.tascricket.com.au/site/_content/document/00000019-source.pdf An exciting batsman with a preference for playing off the back foot, he played for South Hobart Cricket Club in the Tasmanian Grade Cricket competition, and still holds many records in that competition, including being the all-time leading run scorer.http://www.tascricket.com.au/site/_content/document/00000058-source.pdf Club career Ronald Morrisby still holds the record for the most runs in a single season in the Tasmanian Grade Cricket competition, having score 1099 runs in the 1950-51 season. His highest season average of 77.71 is also still the highest ever. Morrisby is also the all-time leading run-scorer in that competition, with his career total for South Hobart Cricket Club, a staggering 16,000 runs exactly. His highest score of 197 against Sandy Bay Cricket Club (his own team South Hobart, and Sandy Bay were later to merge) is the second highest score ever made in the Tasmanian grade competition. He also scored 180*, and passed 150 on six occasions, but never managed a double century in his entire career. Morrisby also holds the record for the highest ever first wicket partnership, when he and Jim Atkinson put on an unbeaten stand of 286 against New Town Cricket Club in the 1931-32 season. He was the highest season aggregate run-scorer in an incredible 13 separate seasons. Morrisby helped South Hobart to five premierships during his career, before finally retired from club cricket in 1960 at the age of 45. First-class career Morrisby made his first-class debut against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, unusually on Christmas Day, 25 December 1931. It was eighteen days before his seventeenth birthday. He was disappointingly bowled for 3 by Arthur Liddicut in his first innings, but a fine 67 in the second showed that he was of first- class cricket material. Morrisby took over the Tasmanian captaincy from Sydney Putman during the 1937-38 season, and held on to the post until his retirement in 1952. Putman was in fact the fourth non-permanent holder of the post during the 1930s, and so Morrisby can be considered the first permanent captain of Tasmania since Jim Atkinson stood down in 1934. The Tasmanian team that played the Indians at Hobart in January 1948. Ron Morrisby, the captain, is seated third from the left. Off the back of an excellent season in 1934-35 in the Tasmanian competition, Morrisby was somewhat surprisingly called up for the Australian team's tour on India in 1935-36, led by Frank Tarrant. He had an excellent tour, scoring 2 centuries, and 3 half-centuries, and played in all four unofficial Test matches (only first-class status) against India. His highest ever first-class score of 145 came against Patiala in Punjab. Having been set a competitive 352 to chase, Morrisby top-scored, including sharing a second-wicket partnership of 274 with New South Welshman, Wendell Bill. Including his matches for Tasmania in that year, Morrisby had the best first- class season of his career in 1935-36, scoring 811 runs at 40.55, with 2 centuries and 5 half-centuries. As with most cricketers of his era, Morrisby's first-class career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. He only ever managed to score one additional century after the 1935-36 tour of India, which had proved to be the highlight of his first-class career, and that came in a match against the touring Indians in the 1947-48 season. They stopped in Tasmania to play two tour matches, and in the second at the NTCA Ground on 16 January 1948, Morrisby made 130 in a remarkable Tasmanian total of 458 all out, chasing the Indians first innings score of 7 for 457 declared. The match was rain-affected, and ended in a draw, but is notable in that it was the first-class debut of Emerson Rodwell, who was to become the next great Tasmanian batsman of the following generation. Morrisby continued playing first-class cricket until the 1951-52 season, when he retired at the age of 37. In 51 matches, Morrisby had accumulated 2596 runs at an average of 32.45 including 3 centuries, and 14 half-centuries, with a high score of 145. Ronald Morrisby also umpired in a match between Southern Tasmania Cricket Association and the North-West Tasmania Cricket Association in 1955-56.

He is a reader in nationalism at the London School of Economics (LSE), in the Department of Government. Early life and education Born in Warrenpoint, County Down, Northern Ireland, he graduated with an MA in modern history from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland in 1970; and his PhD in sociology in 1985 from the London School of Economics, where he was supervised by Anthony D. Smith. Career Before joining the LSE in 1999, Hutchinson taught in Australia at the interdisciplinary School of Humanities at Griffith University, from 1974 to 1979, and from 1986 to 1999, where he became associate professor. He is vice-president of the Association for the Study of Ethnicity and Nationalism and deputy editor of Nations and Nationalism. In addition, he sits on the advisory boards of the Institute for the Advancement of the Social Sciences at Boston University and of the Study Platform on Interlocking Nationalisms at the University of Amsterdam. Research Hutchinson is an interdisciplinary scholar whose work has contributed to theories of nationalism, the study of cultural nationalism, notably in Ireland, and more recently, warfare and nationalism. He is a leading scholar of the ethnosymbolist school (established by Smith) that highlights the role of embedded historical memories in the formation of modern nations. His first monograph, The Dynamics of Cultural NationalismThe dynamics of cultural nationalism: the Gaelic revival and the creation of the Irish nation, J Hutchinson ‚Äì 1987 ‚Äì Allen & Unwin Pty. was nominated in 1988 for the Political Studies Association Prize and is widely citedWalker Connor in Ethnic and Racial Studies, 13, 1990,Catherine B. Shannon in American Historical Review, 95 (2), 1990Kosaku Yoshino in Nations and Nationalism, 1 (2), July 1995 by scholars as a pioneering contribution to the field of Irish history and cultural nationalism. Hutchinson rejected earlier scholarship that tended to conflate nationalism and state-seeking movements. He argued that cultural nationalists should be differentiated from political nationalists, in having as their goal the defence of the nation as a community and its historical distinctiveness rather than on the achievement of a state. He explains how cultural nationalists act as moral innovators, emerging at times of crisis, to form movements that offer new maps of identity based on historical myths, that in turn may inspire programmes of socio-political regeneration. Hutchinson argues such movements operate sometimes as complementary to and sometimes as communitarian alternatives to political nationalism, when statist strategies are defunct. He emphasises the dynamic the role of historians and artists, showing how they interact with religious reformists and a discontented modernising intelligentsia to form national identities. His second book, Modern Nationalism (Fontana 1994) applies this cultural approach to the analysis of contemporary politics, notably, the relationship of nationalism to the collapse of communism, the religious revival and contentions in multicultural polities. More recently, his Nations as Zones of Conflict (Sage 2005) has sought to combine the focus of ethnosymbolists on the historical embeddedness of nations with the stress of postmodernists on the multiplicity of identities by exploring nations as heterogeneous entities, characterised by persisting conflicts that derive from historic divisions (e.g., civil wars). Hutchinson argues that the role of contestation in nation-formation has been neglected. Such conflicts serve to \\"fill out\\" national identities and they give rise to alternative cultural and political visions that offer options to populations at times of crisis. This study has provoked praise and controversy.Eric Kaufmann review in British Journal of Sociology, 57 (2) 2006, pp. 319‚Äì20. Eric Kaufmann claims \\"Hutchinson dramatically expands the boundaries of the ethnosymbolist argument to engage not only 'modernist' but postmodernist critiques of the nation.\\"Andreas Wimmer Nations and Nationalism 14 (1) 2008, p.10. See also \\"Debate on John Hutchinson's Nations as Zones of Conflict\\", Nations and Nationalism 14 (1) 2008, 14 (1), pp. 1‚Äì28. Although critical of what he sees as Hutchinson's idealist approach, Andreas Wimmer states: \\"(Hutchinson's) analysis of the layered character of nationalist myths, the internal heterogeneity and conflictual nature of nationalist discourse, as well as the episodic nature of nationalist mobilization represents a considerable step forward towards a more differentiated view of the nature of nationalism.\\" With Smith, Hutchinson co-edited Nationalism (Oxford 1994) and Ethnicity (Oxford 1996) that have become standard teaching texts for courses on nationalism in the English-speaking world, and his works have been translated into several languages, including Chinese, Norwegian and Turkish.

The fissures in the rock produce a howling sound in gales, hence the name. The lighthouse is in height and is constructed from Cornish granite prepared at Penzance, on the mainland of Cornwall. It took eight years, from 1861 to 1869, to build due to the treacherous weather conditions that can occur between Cornwall and Scilly. The light can be seen from Land's End by day and night, and lies about one third of the distance from Land's End to the Isles of Scilly. It has a range of and was automated in 1988. The lighthouse was the first in the world to be fitted with a helipad. Geology Situated between Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, the Wolf Rock is a small plug of phonolitic lava formed during the early part of the Cretaceous period and is unlike any rock exposed on the Cornish mainland. History Engineering drawing showing the structure of Wolf Rock Lighthouse. The Gabrielle of Milford Haven was wrecked on the Wolf Rock in 1394. Her cargo, worth ¬£1000, was washed ashore in Cornwall and collected as wreck. Earlier seamarks In 1790, the Corporation of Trinity House received a patent of the Crown to build a lighthouse on Wolf Rock. The rights were leased to a Lt. Henry Smith; but (such were the technical challenges of the venture) the project was transferred to the less exposed location of the Longships, where construction of a lighthouse proceeded. On Wolf Rock, rather than a lighthouse, Lt. Smith went on to build a high wrought iron daymark, in diameter and supported by six stays. A metal effigy of a wolf was placed on top; but by 1795 the daymark was washed away. In the late 1830s John Thurburn built a beacon, which was completed on 15 July 1840, and in November of that year was wrecked by storms when the pole and globe on its top were washed away and not replaced until 1842 but they were once more washed away in a storm on 9 October 1844. Trinity House engineer James Walker constructed a high cone-shaped beacon, which took five years to build. Made of iron plates and filled with concrete rubble this was completed in 1848, it can still be seen next to the lighthouse. Construction of the lighthouse In April 1860, Trinity House applied to the Board of Trade for funds to build a lighthouse on Wolf Rock. Approval was given and Walker, as engineer-in-chief, drew up designs for a masonry tower, tapering in diameter from at the base to at the top. Details of the design followed closely that of other Walker-built lighthouses: the recently completed Bishop Rock and Hanois lights, and the Smalls (which was then nearing completion). While his designs were inspired by Smeaton's third Eddystone Lighthouse, Walker introduced new innovations, not least the use of vertical as well as horizontal dovetail joints (first achieved at Les Hanois at the suggestion of Nicholas Douglass, and likewise incorporated into the design of Wolf Rock). Nicholas's son James Douglass was appointed as resident engineer, and in July 1861 he arrived (fresh from completing his work as resident engineer for the Smalls lighthouse) and surveyed the rock. The following March work began on excavating the foundations. In October 1862, James Walker died (at the age of 81). James Douglass replaced him as engineer- in-chief to the Trinity House; James's younger brother, William Douglass, then became resident engineer at Wolf Rock. William himself laid the first stone of the new tower on 6 August 1864. Masonry construction was completed on 19 July 1869. The finished tower was topped by a lantern storey manufactured by Chance Brothers of Smethwick to James Douglass's design. The lantern had previously been exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1867 as an example of the latest in lantern technology, using curved rather than flat panes of glass and helical rather than straight glazing bars. Engineering drawing of the 1869 optic and sectional view of it within the lantern, alongside a chart showing location in relation to other lights. James Chance of Chance Brothers had designed a large (first-order) rotating multi-panel optic for installation in the tower, high by diameter. In order to differentiate the light from the nearby St Agnes lighthouse (which displayed a white light) and from Les Hanois Lighthouse (which displayed a red light) it was resolved that the Wolf Rock light should revolve and flash alternately red and white; in order to achieve the required characteristic it was planned to install 'ruby' coloured panes of glass over half the panels on the optic (with the intervening panels left clear). It was known, however, that the intensity of a light was reduced when shone through coloured glass, so Chance conducted experiments to measure the precise difference. It was concluded that the comparative intensity of clear glass to red was 21 to 9 (i.e. more than double); therefore the red-covered panels on the optic were made wider than the others by the same proportion, in order to maintain an even intensity across the colour-change. Operational summary The light first shone in January 1870 and flashed red and white as planned. The completed optic (which together with its pedestal stood high) was described by Douglass as \\"probably the most perfect for the purpose that has yet been constructed\\"; it continued in use for the next hundred years. The optic was rotated by a clockwork drive, that required winding every four hours. A 7-cwt bell, hung from the lantern gallery, was sounded in fog; driven by a separate clockwork mechanism, it rang three times every fifteen seconds. The Wolf Rock was the site of a hake (Merluccius merluccius) fishery in the 1870s, especially by fishermen from St Ives with 400 employed in October 1879. In 1904 a reed fog signal was installed; it remained in use until after the Second World War. (The bell was initially retained for standby use, but was decommissioned in 1906.)[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/27902/page/2441 London Gazette, Issue 27902, Page 2441, 6 April 1906] In 1955 electrification came to Wolf Rock Lighthouse: a 15 kW tungsten filament lamp was installed in place of the oil lamp, within the old optic, and a set of diesel generators were installed (which powered not only the light but also a new diaphone fog signal). Then, in 1972 Wolf Rock became the first lighthouse in the world to be fitted with a helipad (a smaller fourth-order revolving optic having replaced the original in the meantime); this greatly eased the challenge of getting keepers to and from the lighthouse in heavy seas. The last keepers left Wolf Rock in July 1988, when the lighthouse became fully automated; an electric emitter replaced the diaphone fog signal at this time. Fifteen years later the lighthouse was converted to solar power, with photovoltaic cells being installed around the exterior of the helideck support structure. Present day The lighthouse continues in operation; its solar-powered lamp has a range of ; it flashes once every 15 seconds and is remotely monitored from the Trinity House Planning Centre in Harwich, Essex.

This tree is native to much of Africa and parts of the Middle East. There are many common names for this plant. In English the fruit has been called desert date, soap berry tree or bush, Thron tree, Egyptian myrobalan, Egyptian balsam or Zachum oil tree; in Arabic it is known as lalob, hidjihi, inteishit, and heglig (hijlij). In Jieng it is called Thou or thau, in Hausa it is called aduwa, in Tamasheq, the Tuareg language taboraq, in Fulani or Pulaar \\"Murtooki\\", in Swahili mchunju and in Amharic bedena.Yves Guinand and Dechassa Lemessa, \\"Wild-Food Plants in Southern Ethiopia: Reflections on the role of 'famine-foods' at a time of drought\\" UN- OCHA Report, March 2000 (accessed 15 January 2009) Distribution Balanites aegyptiaca is found in Northern Eastern Africa, Egypt, and also the Sahel- Savannah region across Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It can be found in many kinds of habitat, tolerating a wide variety of soil types, from sand to heavy clay, and climatic moisture levels, from arid to subhumid. It is relatively tolerant of flooding, livestock activity, and wildfire. Description The Balanites aegyptiaca tree reaches in height with a generally narrow form. The branches have long, straight green spines arranged in spirals. The dark green compound leaves grow out of the base of the spines and are made up of two leaflets which are variable in size and shape. The fluted trunk has grayish-brown, ragged bark with yellow-green patches where it is shed. The inflorescence consists of bunches of a few flowers which are either sessile or are borne on short stalks. The flower buds are ovoid and covered in a short tomentose pubescence. The individual flowers are greenish- yellow in colour, hermaphroditic with five petals in radial symmetry and are in diameter. The pedicel of the inflorescence is greyish in colour, downy and usually less than in length, although has been recorded in Zambia and Zimbabwe. The ellipsoid fruit is normally less than long and is green when not ripe; it ripens to a brown or pale brown fruit with a crispy skin enclosing a sticky brown or brown-green pulp around a hard stone. The carpenter ant Camponotus sericeus feeds on the nectar exuded by the flowers. The larva of the cabbage tree emperor moth Bunaea alcinoe causes defoliation of the tree. Cultivation Food Fruits of Balanites aegyptiaca from Saqqara. Mastaba of Perneb, 5th dynasty of Egypt. MET. Balanites aegyptiaca has been cultivated in Egypt for more than 4000 years, and stones placed in tombs as votive offerings have been found as far back as the Twelfth Dynasty. The tree was described in 1592 by Prospero Alpini under the name 'agihalid'. Linnaeus regarded it as a species of Ximenia, but Michel Adanson proposed the new genus of Agialid. The genus Balanites was founded in 1813 by Delile. The yellow, single-seeded fruit is edible, but bitter. Many parts of the plant are used as famine foods in Africa; the leaves are eaten raw or cooked, the oily seed is boiled to make it less bitter and eaten mixed with sorghum, and the flowers can be eaten. The tree is considered valuable in arid regions because it produces fruit even in dry times. The fruit can be fermented for alcoholic beverages. The seed cake remaining after the oil is extracted is commonly used as animal fodder in Africa. The seeds of the Balanites aegyptiaca have molluscicide effect on Biomphalaria pfeifferi.Hamidou T. H., Kabore H., Ouattara O., Ou√©draogo S., Guissou I. P. & Sawadogo L. () \\"Efficacy of Balanites aegyptiaca(L.) DEL Balanitaceae as Anthelminthic and Molluscicid Used by Traditional Healers in Burkina Faso\\". International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases 2002. page 37. PDF Where the species coexist, African elephants consume the desert date. Medicinal Desert date fruit is mixed into porridge and eaten by nursing mothers, and the oil is consumed for headache and to improve lactation. Bark extracts and the fruit repel or destroy freshwater snails and copepods, organisms that act as intermediary hosts of parasites including Schistosoma, Bilharzia, and guinea worm. Worm infections are likewise treated with desert date, as are liver and spleen disorders. A decoction of the bark is also used as an abortifacient and an antidote for arrow poison in West African traditional medicine. The seed contains 30-48% fixed (non-volatile) oil, like the leaves, fruit pulp, bark and roots, and contains the sapogenins diosgenin and yamogenin. Saponins likewise occur in the roots, bark wood and fruit. Agroforestry The tree is managed through agroforestry. It is planted along irrigation canals and is used to attract insects for trapping. The pale to brownish yellow wood is used to make furniture and durable items such as tools, and is a low-smoke firewood that makes good charcoal. The smaller trees and branches are used as living or cut fences because they are resilient and thorny. The tree fixes nitrogen. It is grown for its fruit in plantations in several areas. The bark yields fibers, the natural gums from the branches are used as glue, and the seeds have been used to make jewelry and beads. Tattoos Various Sahel tribes use the thorn of the tree to make incisions that result in tattoos. Tapon, Francis \\"The History of Tattoos in Africa\\". Retrieved December 7, 2016.\\"\\" Etymology The generic part of the binomial Balanites derives from the Greek word for an acorn and refers to the fruit, this name was coined by Alire Delile in 1813. in Descr. Egypte, Hist. Nat. 221 1813. The specific name aegyptiaca was applied by Carl Linnaeus as the species was initially described from specimens collected in Egypt. However, according to ICBN Art 62.4: \\"Generic names ending in -anthes, -oides or -odes are treated as feminine and those ending in -ites as masculine, irrespective of the gender assigned to them by the original author.\\" Accordingly, the orthographic variant name that complies with ICBN Art 62.4 for this species is Balanites aegyptiacus.

Broadly, it was a Scottish term for what in England was called the Bloodhound, although it seems that there were slight differences between them. It was also referred to as a 'slough dog', (or 'slewe dogge'), and a 'slow hound', the first word probably representing a mispronunciation of 'slough' rather than a reference to the speed of the hound. The sleuth hound first appears in poems about the Scottish patriots Robert the BruceJohn Barbour The Bruce 1375 and William Wallace.Henry the Minstrel (Blind Harry) The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace 1470 These poems depict their heroes tracked by sleuth hounds. Bruce escapes by crossing water, and Wallace by killing one of his party, whom he suspects of treachery, and leaving the corpse to distract the hound. The poems are romances, not histories, but there is no implausibility about the use of sleuth hounds. John Barbour, who wrote The Bruce, was born before his hero died, and the year in which the Bruce was supposedly pursued was 1307. Thus, the inclusion of the sleuth hound in the story was no anachronism, hence that the dogs existed in Scotland as early as , and that their use as man-trailers was fully established. The earliest description of the sleuth hound is in The history and croniklis of Scotland 1536, a translation by John Bellenden of a Latin text by Hector Boece, Historia Gentis Scotorum (History of the Scottish People), originally published in 1526. The sleuth hound is described as one of three kinds of dog unique to Scotland. It is said to be red or black with small spots. Its special quality is its marvelous scenting power and determination in pursuing thieves (known as Border Reivers). The law of the borders between Scotland and England required that he who denies entry to the sleuth hound when in pursuit of stolen goods is held as an accomplice to the theft. John Caius (translated from Latin by Fleming 1576)John Caius tr Abraham Fleming Of Englisshe Dogges 1576 describes very similar uses of the English bloodhound on the borders, leading us to think that the Bloodhound and sleuth hound were the same animal. In a book published in Switzerland in 1554 the sleuth hound is also called 'bl√ºthund' and 'canis Scoticus furum deprehensor' ('Scottish dog, thief catcher').Conrad Gesner(1554): Historiae Animalium It is confirmed here and in other texts of the time that the two animals were the same, except that the Bloodhound was somewhat larger, and had a greater variety of coat colours than the sleuth hound.Edward Topsell The History of Four Footed Beasts 1607 Generally, references to the sleuth hound appear in a man-trailing context, whereas the Bloodhound may appear either as a man- trailer or as a seeker of beasts in the hunting field. Probably from around 1700, any differences between the two types disappeared. \\"Bloodhound\\" becomes the usual term even in Scottish sources, such as Sir Walter Scott. The Scottish term survives in its metaphorical use from the beginning of the 19th century as a detective, now usually shortened to sleuth.The Oxford English Dictionary Boece's account > OF THE MERUELLUS NATURE OF SYNDRY SCOTTIS DOGGIS > In Scotland ar doggis of meruellous nature, For abone the commoun nature and > condition of doggis, quhilkis ar sene in al partis, ar thre maner of doggis > in Scotland, quhilk ar sene in na vthir partis of the warld....

Whether this is an error by Bellenden, or a deliberate correction, is uncertain.

It was made of 50%-70% alcohol containing camphor, ammonia, chloroform, sassafras, cloves, and turpentine, and was said to be usable both internally and topically. Traveling performance troupes advertised the product in medicine shows across the Midwest, with runs as long as six weeks in a town. They used horse-drawn wagons and dressed in silk top hats, frock coats, pinstriped trousers, and patent leather shoes‚Äîwith spats. They distributed song books at the shows and in pharmacies. Performers included James Whitcomb Riley, singer and composer Paul Dresser from Indiana, and southern gospel music progenitor Charles Davis Tillman. At these gatherings John Austin Hamlin delivered lectures replete with humor borrowed from the writings of Robert Jones Burdette. Grinnell College research points out that the Hamlins claimed efficacy for Wizard Oil on not only human beings but also horses and cattle, one poster displaying an elephant drinking the stuff by lifting the bottle with the trunk.

In 1973, he joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), the ruling party of East Germany in order to study the system from inside. At the same time he published dissident poems and prose. This led to his forceful disenrollment from the university shortly before graduation and his expulsion from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in 1975. Fuchs married his wife Lieselotte in 1974. His daughter Lili was born in 1975 in Jena. In the summer of 1975 the family moved to Berlin where Fuchs became a social worker in a church charity, one of the few work options for a political dissident. Following his protest against the deprivation of East German citizenship of Wolf Biermann, he was arrested November 19, 1976. Fuchs spent 9 months in prison of the East German secret service Stasi in Berlin- Hohensch√∂nhausen (but he was not sentenced until 1982). Following international protests, Fuchs was released from prison and deported to West Berlin together with his family in August 1977. Fuchs was a victim of the Stasi's techniques, which he described as \\"an assault on the human soul\\".Pingel-Schliemann: Zersetzen. S. 188 After his arrival in West Berlin, he published protocols of his detention and he continued to be a target for the Stasi. In the early 1980s, Fuchs became involved in the peace movement.

Legislation on euthanasia in Mexico distinguishes between passive and active euthanasia. Since 7 January 2008 the law allows the terminally ill ‚Äîor closest relatives, if unconscious‚Äî to refuse medication or further medical treatment that may extend life (known as passive euthanasia) in Mexico City, in the state of Aguascalientes (since 6 April 2009) and, since 1 September 2009, in the state of Michoac√°n. While the exact procedure may vary, the regional laws dealing with living wills ‚Äîusually called ‚Äî generally require a notary public to witness the instructions left by the patient. As for active euthanasia, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) have introduced bills to decriminalize it in both the Senate (2007) and the Legislative Assembly of the Federal District (2009), but have failed to change the Article 166 bis 21 of the General Health Law, which still defines euthanasia as mercy homicide. In addition, , 18 out of 31 states have modified their constitution under pressure from the dominant Catholic Church to protect the right to life \\"from the moment of conception until natural death\\", effectively discarding any initiative contemplating active euthanasia within state borders. Practice Official statistics are scarce but bioethicist Horacio Garc√≠a Romero claims that up to 45% of the terminally-ill patients in the country demand some form of passive euthanasia. On October 2010 the secretary of health for Mexico City announced that, since the legalization of passive euthanasia, 497 patients have formalized the process, including at least 41 out-of-state residents and 2 citizens of the United States. Public opinion and political lobbying According to a Parametr√≠a poll conducted in February 2008, 59% of Mexicans think doctors should have the legal right to end the life of a person suffering from an incurable illness upon a request by the patient and his or her relatives, while 35% disagree. Its main opponents, pro-life activists and Christian churches ‚Äîparticularly the dominant Roman Catholic Church‚Äî have strongly lobbied against active euthanasia and promote different bills protecting the right to life \\"from the moment of conception until natural death.\\" However, regional bills supporting passive euthanasia have been endorsed by several Catholic clergymen, including the archbishops of Le√≥n and Morelia. Suicide tourism A drug known as liquid pentobarbital is used by owners to euthanize pets. When given to humans, the drug can give them a painless death in under one hour. The pet shops across Mexico have such drugs. As a result, elderly tourists from across the globe seeking to terminate their own lives were reported to be flying out to Mexico.

Life St John's College Chapel, Cambridge Prys was born in Llanrwst, Denbighshire 1542 or 1543, son of Si√¥n ap Rhys ap Gruffudd ap Rhys and Si√¢n, daughter of Owain ap Llywelyn ab Ieuan. He was a kinsman of the scholar and bible translator William Salesbury who may have been an early influence. On 16 March 1565 he entered St. John's College, Cambridge where he was a contemporary of William Morgan, the bible translator. He graduated B.A. in 1568, in M.A. 1571, and was a Fellow in 1570. On 14 March 1573 he became rector of Festiniog, with its chapelry of Maentwrog. He became Rector of Ludlow in March 1576 and on 5 November 1576 archdeacon of Merioneth. On 16 April 1580 there was added to the livings he already held the rectory of with its chapelry of Llanddwywe, and on 8 October 1602 he was made a canon cursal (a subsidiary canon) of St Asaph Cathedral. He was twice married: first, to Elin, daughter of John ap Lewis of Pengwern, Ffestiniog, by whom he had two sons, John and Robert, and a daughter Jane; secondly, to Gwen, daughter of Morgan ap Lewis of Fronheulog (his first wife's cousin), by whom he had three sons, Ffoulk (Ffowc), Morgan and Edmund. He died in 1623, and was buried in Maentwrog church. There is a memorial to William Morgan and Edmwnd Prys in St John's College Chapel, Cambridge, where they were students.:File:Memorial, St John's College chapel - geograph.org.uk - 630609.jpg Memorial window in St Twrog's Church, Maentwrog. Prys is pictured on the right, with the caption Psalmist of Wales Works Prys composed in the strict Welsh metres, and took an active part in the bardic life of his time. He engaged in duels of satiric verse, crossing swords with his neighbours, Thomas Price (fl. 1586-1632), Si√¥n Phylip,and of Ysbyty Ifan. The last encounter is known for its length (fifty- four poems in total), and the fact that the archdeacon's adversary died while it was proceeding: in view of Prys's advocacy of Renaissance literary fashions it is regarded as a key text of Welsh Renaissance literature.Gruffydd Aled Williams, Ymryson Edmwnd Prys a Wiliam Cynwal (Cardiff, 1986). But Prys's reputation rests on his translation of the psalms into free Welsh verse, suitable for congregational singing. At least nineteen editions of the Salmau C√¢n appeared, chiefly in editions of the Bible. A rendering of the psalms into the strict metres by Captain William Midleton had been issued in 1603, and a freer translation of thirteen by Edward Kyffin had appeared in the same year. In 1621, however, to a new issue of the Welsh version of the Book of Common Prayer was appended Prys's translation of the whole of the psalter. He rejected the bardic metres in order to adapt his work for popular use. His version of Psalm 23 was translated into English, becoming the very popular hymn \\"The King of Love My Shepherd Is\\".http://www.hymnary.org/text/yr_arglwydd_yw_fy_mugail_clau Prys is mentioned by Dr William Morgan as one of three who rendered him assistance in the preparation of his translation of the Bible (1588).

During 2000 she was recruited to work in Kosovo by Germany's Civil Peace Service in the aftermath of the Kosovo War. She subsequently settled in Macedonia (as North Madedonia was known till 12 February 2019). Earlier she came to prominence as a member of the RAF terrorist organisation. She was involved in the kidnapping and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer. On 17 October 1977 it was Silke Maier-Witt who sent a letter to the left-leaning Paris newspaper Lib√©ration announcing that after 43 days [of captivity] the terrorists had \\"ended the miserable and corrupt existence of Hanns-Martin Schleyer\\". \\"Mr. Schmidt\\" (the Federal Chancellor), was invited to collect the body of the former hostage from [the boot/trunk of] a green Audi 100 with a Bad Homburg license plate that had been left parked in the Rue Charles Peguy in Mulhouse. The letter, which she followed up with a telephone call from Frankfurt's main station delivering the same message on 19 October 1977, also hinted strongly at a connection between the Schleyer killing and the \\"massacres in Mogadishu and Stammheim\\". Maier-Witt evaded the West German police till 1980, when she was slipped across to the German Democratic Republic (via Prague) with help from the East German homeland security services (Stasi), and became one of ten former RAF activists who lived hidden across the \\"internal German border\\" under a succession of false identities created for them by the East German Ministry of State Security. However, during the months of change that followed the breaching of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Ministry of State Security was dissolved: suddenly East and West German police services began to work together. During the summer of 1990 the ten RAF fugitives were unmasked. Maier-Witt was arrested on 18 June. In 1991 the high court in Stuttgart sentenced her to ten years' imprisonment, having convicted her on various charges that included participation in the murder of BDA president Hanns Martin Schleyer. She was conditionally released for good behaviour on 16 June 1995, but the \\"terrorist\\" label and accompanying psychological baggage were not so easy to shake off. Life Family background Silke Maier-Witt was born in Nagold in the Black Forest, near Stuttgart, the younger of her parents' two daughters. In 1956, when she was six her mother died of cancer. Her father remarried within a year and took his family north to live in Hamburg, where she lived first with her grandmother and later with an aunt. In 1959 her father took a third wife but her relationship to her latest stepmother was never a relaxed one. Her father had qualified as a shipbuilding engineer. When she was 12 she and her sister investigated the attic where the found a box containing some of her father's mementos: these included clear evidence that the girls' father had belonged to the \\"SS\\" - a paramilitary organisation close to the heart of the Nazi Party. At the time she understood little of what that meant. Four years later, having learned about the Holocaust, she asked her father about the millions of Jews killed in the concentration camps: he reacted aggressively and refused to discuss the matter, so she ignored him for the next two months. Maier-Witt remains haunted by the memory of her father's reaction. It was only several decades later, long after her father had died, that she pieced together the elements she had discovered and completed for herself a deeply disturbing appreciation of what must have been her father's wartime involvements. Education In 1960 she enrolled at the \\"Heilwig Gymnasium\\" (secondary school) in Hamburg. This is where she was later taught about the Holocaust. She moved on to the University of Hamburg in 1969 at a time when the spirit of '68 was still very much alive. \\"Repressive\\" domestic legislation and escalating US involvement in the Vietnam War were feeding a student agenda of political resistance. Maier-Witt studied Medicine and Psychology. Her studies included work on dysfunctional adolescent behaviour. From 1973 she was sharing a Hamburg apartment with Susanne Albrecht and Sigrid Sternebeck. Among their radicalised student comrades they became known at this time as the three \\"Hamburg aunties\\". Outside the lecture halls Maier-Witt joined in demonstrations against the Vietnam war with the others. They also demonstrated in support of better conditions for imprisoned members of the Baader‚ÄìMeinhof Group which had emerged as a militant left-wing faction from the German student movement, and which was by now becoming known as the \\"Red Army Faction\\" (RAF). For Maier-Witt, a turning point was the death in November 1974 of Holger Meins, almost certainly as a result of a hunger strike in pursuit of improved prison conditions. Many of her friends were sympathetic to the RAF and some were members of it; so she was predisposed to react strongly over the death. \\"Meins had risked his life while I was holidaying in Greece. That felt very wrong\\", she told an interviewer much later. She joined the \\"committee against torture\\" and supported the prisoners. \\"I could not think of anything else, and gave up my studies\\". When she was 26 she became pregnant. The father was another left-wing activist. Having a baby was not part of the fight for \\"the cause\\" in which they were all engaged and she had an abortion. Red Army Faction  In a variation of the infamous \\"he who is not for us is against us\\" mantra, Andreas Baader, the RAF founder had issued his \\"human or swine?\\" challenge. Maier-Witt, who much later completed her psychological studies, recalled in 2002 that as a confused student drop-out lacking in self- confidence, she was desperately vulnerable to a slogan offering this type of binary choice. She certainly did not wish to be thought a bourgeois swine from a small-town Black Forest environment. She began to undertake missions for the RAF, travelling across Europe providing \\"courier services\\" for her comrades. What amounted to her formal recruitment took place in an apartment in Amsterdam on 7 April 1977, just a few hours after the killing in Karlsruhe of Public Prosecutor Siegfried Buback. J√ºrgen Boock handed over a Colt pistol to the new recruit. It was both a crossing into illegality and the \\"passport to a new identity\\". Looking back on that moment she resists the temptation to blame anyone else: \\"No one talked me into it, I came across of my own accord. Of course I knew we were criminals ... I could not step back, wanted to belong, there was no alternative. I have always been quicker to say 'yes' than 'no'. ... Till now [in 2002] I still cannot understand that decision\\". Later she would identify a parallel between her own actions in joining the RAF and her father's motives when, aged just 19, he joined the \\"SS\\". The overwhelming urge to be part of something larger than oneself was something that she and her father, at least when young adults, seemed to have shared. Hanns-Martin Schleyer RAF members used cover names, just as members of the (at the time, and again in West Germany after 1953, illegal) German Communist Party had done during (and before) the Hitler years. Silke Maier-Witt chose the cover name \\"Sonja\\", a name popular in the Soviet Union where it also identifies the Dormouse. Although she accepts \\"collective guilt\\" for the murders committed by the group, she asserts that she never personally killed anyone, and indeed after two and a half years, troubled by a conflicted conscience, she handed back her gun. Her contribution was more logistical, as part of a support group. She would rent cars, gather intelligence and scope out locations. She would use the rented cars to take guns across borders or simply to carry messages that were unsuitable for safe transmission through the public telephone or mail services. She was trained in the art of forging passport stamps. As regards the kidnapping and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer, her role is described in various sources as that of a \\"Sp√§herin\\" (loosely, \\"scout\\" or \\"look-out\\"). Also, after the kidnapping it was Maier-Witt who typed up the transcriptions from the lengthy tapes of interrogation sessions that her comrades had conducted with Schleyer. According to one estimate RAF terrorism killed 33 people and injured around 200, but it was the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer that most grabbed the headlines, both at the time and subsequently. A poster showing the faces of 16 \\"urgently sought terrorists\\" was widely distributed. Shortly after the killing she found herself sitting having her hair cut with her face on a \\"wanted\\" poster looking out at her, hanging in front of the hairdresser's mirror. Whether because of her \\"terrorist training\\" or a natural ability to go unnoticed, she nevertheless this time avoided being spotted. In 1978 her father suffered a heart attack and died. Maier-Witt was by now keen to avoid arrest and estranged from her family. She did not re-establish contact with her stepmother and siblings to attend the funeral. Z√ºrich bank raid Funding was a constant preoccupation for the RAF. One solution was bank raids. On 18 November 1979, as a gang of RAF bank robbers fled after a bank robbery in Z√ºrich, three of them, including Christian Klar, opened fire at a pursuing policeman. A ricocheting bullet hit a passer-by looking at the displays in the window of a fashion store. The woman later died. (Maier-Witt would find out only in 1990 that she had been Jewish.) Silke Maier-Witt had been involved in planning the Z√ºrich bank raid. A part of her consciousness that had been closed off since the killing of Hanns-Martin Schleyer suddenly clicked open. The woman had died not because of some high political objective, but simply as part of a funding operation so that the RAF could carry on renting apartments, pay for food and car-hire. It was now that she, and several comrades, handed back their weapons after taking the decision to quit active involvement and to disappear. Wioth several others she took a trip to Paris, and from there they moved on to Prague, out of reach of western law enforcement agencies. Retirement from active RAF participation During the later 1970s the tactics of the RAF became more extreme and the idealism that had motivated its members earlier in the decade was becoming harder to sustain. By the end of 1979 Silke Maier-Witt was one of eight \\"drop out\\" RAF members who no longer wished to participate in the group's violent activities. The police had become more determined to catch them. The \\"wanted\\" posters were harder to avoid and successful bank raids became impossible. Endless discussions took place over what to do about so- called drop-outs, whose recruitment the leaders were now inclined to view as \\"mistakes\\". There seems to have been no willingness from anyone for the drop- outs simply to \\"hand themselves in\\", and no appetite for simply identifying them as security risks and shooting them. The RAF managed to transfer their retirees abroad, however, abeit without credible identity papers, first to Paris and from there to Prague. From Prague there was talk of transferring to safety in \\"Black Africa\\", where several Marxist governments would, it was assumed, view the ex-terrorists with sympathy. Thinking to settle in Angola or Mozambique, Maier-Witt was one of several who started to study Portuguese as they waited in Prague. Resettling eight former terrorist accomplices at the far end of Africa was not a task for which the RAF were equipped. They needed expert assistance. Not for the first time (as it later turned out) they turned to contacts in the East German Ministry for state security (\\"Stasi\\"). Inge Viett, who had joined the RAF as a result of a merger with the 2 June [West German terrorist] Movement, had already conducted exploratory discussions on the possibilities with her contact, Stasi Colonel Harry Dahl. His reaction, when asked for help exporting the retirees to soutern Africa was cautious but positive: \\"Sooo, eight people, that's not so simple. But we shall see. Solidarity [between Marxist comades] is indeed out first duty\\". The next day he came back with a question: \\"Did you not think of delivering the demobilised fighters to us?\\". The Stasi expressed concern that hiding the \\"demobilised fighters\\" in Angola or Mozamboque was impractical on very many levels, including the issues of language and skin colour. There was also a concern that the RAF \\"drop outs\\" might disclose what they knew of links between the East German security services and the West German terrorist groups. Instead, at the start of September 1980, the eight were invited to relocate to East Germany where they were issued with new identities and coached till they had mastered their cover stories, before being distributed across the remoter corners of East Germany and permitted to start new lives, albeit under surveillance, and without being permitted to contact one another. Welcome to the German Democratic Republic In East Germany the Stasi installed their RAF guests in a lakeside \\"summercamp\\" in the Briesen Woods (\\"Forst Brisen\\"). They were the only guests and the compound was fenced off inside a \\"militarily restricted No-go-Area\\". Maier-Witt told her hosts that she had come to the German Democratic Republic because she rejected the \\"imperialist state\\" and wanted to participate in the \\"struggle for peace and the building of socialism\\". She probably meant it: she appears to have found it relatively easy to settle down in East Germany. The new arrivals were issued with new names, new identity documents and meticulously concocted back-stories covering everything from education and work histories to marriage histories that could be used to explain why they were to be living alone and without any living relatives in the area. They received intensive training about how to fit in. You did not visit the \\"Supermarket\\" but the \\"Kaufhalle\\" to buy your groceries. East German language conventions might incorporate a few words of Russian, but recently minted terms from the capitalist west were not widely encountered. In this and other ways the languages of East and West Germany had diverged since the separate states were formally launched in 1949. From the summer camp the westerners were dispersed with new identities and back stories to their new homes. She was allowed to choose her own name. The Stasi helped Silke Maier- Witt relaunch herself as \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" in Hoyerswerda, a small manufacturing town, for most purposes well off the beaten track, south of Cottbus and east of Dresden. It was as \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" that on 1 September 1980 she submitted her application for East German citizenship. Soon afterwards she applied successfully for party membership. 20 Stasi \\"informal co-workers\\" were tasked with looking after the 8 ex-RAF operatives from the west as a full-time assignment in order that the authorities might be confident that their guests were integrating satisfactorily into East German society. Despite the care taken over preparing her for her new life, Silke- Maier Witt herself later recalled one incident early on during her time in the little town which demonstrated that even the Stasi had not thought of everything. She visited a local bank and asked to exchange her West German Deutschmarks for East German Ostmarks at a 1:1 exchange rate. Travel beyond the Inner German border was a rare privilege for East German comrades, and anyone who had somehow ended up with western currency to spare would normally have exchanged it (illegally) on the street rather than putting up with the official exchange rates offered in the banks: the bank workers looked at her as though they had seen a ghost. The episode was one well calculated to encourage the \\"wrong\\" sort of interest among the townsfolk, although after more than two decades of one-party dictatorship most East Germans had learned not to be too outspoken with any questions. At the end of 1983 she had to be withdrawn from Hoyerswerda on account of unspecified \\"security concerns\\". One source indicates that in a small town such as Hoyerswerda she was more likely to get caught up in personal conversation with nosey neighbours which gave rise to a heightened risk of her true identity being inadvertently suspected or discloseded. and \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" from Hoyersweda moved into a newly built apartment near the Moskauer Platz in Erfurt. It was presumably a reflection of Silke Maier-Witt's unfinished medical studies in Hamburg that \\"Angelika Gerlach's\\" back story also included time as a trainee physician who had never qualified. Presumably it reflected a failure to lose her western accent that she was told to explain that she had relocated to the German Democratic Republic from \\"West Germany\\" out of political conviction. She would later recall: \\"Hardly anyone believed me!\\" She became a trainee nurse in a local hospital. The hospital work lasted till 1985 which indicates that the work may not have been full-time, since for some or all of the time between 1980 and 1985 she was also studying. She was positioned well down in the hospital hierarchy, and one of her jobs involved washing the bodies of people who had recently died. She told one interviewer that the task provided her with an \\"almost spiritual atonement\\". After the enforced relocation to Erfurt she was able to study information technology at the nearby Ilmenau Technical College. During this period \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" also studied at the Fachhochschule Walter Kr√§mer in Weimar and successfully completed her nursing exams at the medical faculty in Erfurt. The end of \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" On 20 March 1986 the Ministry for State Security received information from the vast KGB \\"Residentur\\" (establishment) in Berlin-Karlshorst that the \\"authorities in West Germany\\" had received \\"anonymous information according to which the wanted terrorist Silke Maier-Witt appeared to be identical with an East German citizen who had studied at Fachhochschule Walter Kr√§mer in Weimar and completed exams at the medical faculty in Erfurt\\". The \\"red hot tip-off\\" had actually been received nine months earlier by the West German intelligence, probably from an East German escapee. The informant had studied with \\"Ms. Gerlach\\" at the Fachhochschule Walter Kr√§mer in Weimar. He been astonished, on reaching the west, to see his fellow student looking out at him from \\"wanted\\" posters on public noticeboards. It is not immediately clear how the KGB got hold of the information. Researchers at the Stasi Records Agency suggest that the most likely explanation would be that it came from an unidentified Soviet mole working inside German intelligence. Meanwhile, in West Germany the intelligence services had reacted cautiously to the unexpected news of former RAF operatives apparently living under a new identity East Germany. Completely independently of the \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" matter, two other cases of RAF retirees living hidden in East Germany had come to their notice at about the same time. (The East German authorities had hitherto been remarkably successful, for more than a decade, in keeping their contacts with the RAF hidden from their West German counterparts.) Delays in the west seem to have been exacerbated by mutual suspicions and rivalries between the Wiesbaden- based Federal (i.e. national) Police Service (\\"Bundeskriminalamt\\") and the Federal Intelligence Service (\\"Bundesnachrichtendienst\\") (based at that time in Bonn). A series of police enquiries were launched using the informal channels that by the mid 1980s were beginning to exist between officials from West and East Germany. After \\"countless meetings\\" West German officials formed the conclusion that \\"an official application to the East German authorities\\" in respect of the matter was not likely to lead to any helpful outcome. From the Stasi perspective, however, by the middle of 1986 there could no longer be any doubt that \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" would have to disappear. Once that decision had been taken, \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" was hastily moved, initially to Cottbus and then to a Stasi apartment in Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg, where work commenced on a new identity for her. Her sudden disappearance from Erfurt was explained by a slightly vague story that was fed to anyone interested, involving a rather complicated fictitious love affair in Cottbus. Systematically all trace of \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" was crubbed from the records at the college where she had been studying and from the local police residency records. \\"Gerlach\\" herself, working with Gerd Zaumseil, her principal Stasi minder (\\"F√ºhrungsoffizier\\"), cleared the apartment, taking care, once it was empty, to clean every surface thoroughly so that no residual finger prints could ever be found. It was virtually the same procedure that six years earlier she would have undertaken when cleaning out an apartment that RAF terrorists had been using to hide a hostage or to prepare for a bank raid. A few days later she booked a holiday, handed in her notice from her work, and disappeared. Leaving the (still almost new) apartment empty might have opened up avoidable risks, so a trusted \\"informal co-worker\\" was found by the State Security Ministry to take over the tenancy. Faced with the failure of their attempts to pursue the reports they had received of RAF retirees living in East Germany through West Germany's own Intelligence Service, the western police turned to other channels. They asked the CIA for help, but the Americans were - not without good reason - still deeply suspicious of the intelligence environment in West Germany, and they provided the West German police with no useful information. It was beginning to look as though the East German decision to get rid of Angelika Gerlach had been unnecessary or at least over-hasty. But other possibilities were opening up thanks to political and economic developments that went largely unnoticed at the time. East Germany was running out of political capital and it was running out of money. Winds of change blowing across from, of all places, Moscow left the ruling political establishment internationally isolated, while increased investment in heavy engineering industrial capacity by the Soviet government meant that East German trade negotiators in search of trade deals were increasingly encountering Soviet trade negotiators not as comradely partners, but as commercial rivals. Between East and West Germany this formed the background to a quiet growth in political contacts. Elsewhere in the public sector the quality and extent of east‚Äìwest collaboration was also evolving. In December 1987 the West German Police Service (\\"Bundeskriminalamt\\") tried the direct approach. During the run-up to an important state visit by the East German leader Erich Honecker, a senior East German Stasi official, visiting Meckenheim (near Bonn) in order to help with preparations for the visit, was stopped by a senior western police official who took the opportunity to remind his startled eastern interlocutor of the \\"good collaboration involved in preparing and carrying through the official visit of Comrade Honecker to West Germany\\". The westerner then slipped the Stasi man a so-called \\"non-paper\\". This consisted of eleven lines of typescript on a piece of plain paper, unembellished by any header or signature. It summarized what the western police knew about the student career of an ex-terrorist in the German Democratic Reublic identified by the student reference \\"Klasse KR-FE/83\\" and finished with a couple of questions: \\"Where did Mrs. Gerlach come from, and where did she end up [after disappearing from her studies]?\\" In the political and economic context of 1987, the matter could not simply be ignored, as might have been the case ten years earlier. But for the Stasi officials to whom the enquiry was passed on, working out how to reply was not such a simple matter. With east-west relations still at best \\"uncertain\\", the Stasi were keen to ensure that no (further) whisper of Stasi involvement with RAF fugitives hiding in the east should come to the attention of the western authorities. If it did, the Ministry could easily find itself blamed for serious damage to the German-German relationship. Stasi Deputy General Lieutenant Gerhard Neiber personally took responsibility for overseeing the creation of a new destiny for \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" that might take off at the point where she had disappeared. The first idea was that she had taken a trip to Lebanon from which she had never returned. The someone spotted that by the time of \\"Angelika Gerlach's\\" disappearance the Interflug service between East Berlin and Beirut had been withdrawn. In the end they settled on the idea that \\"Gerlach\\" had escaped the country by taking a camping holiday in Hungary, at the end of which she was believed to have made her way to the west rather than returning home. In order to add credibility, the Stasi arranged for one of their \\"informal co-workers\\" to file a missing person report with the police. A file of supporting paperwork was created, including the suggestion that West German police might be requested to help in the search for the missing woman believed/presumed now to be in \\"the west\\". They did not go so far as to follow up on that suggestion, however. Indeed, in March 1988 the typed \\"non-paper\\" that the western police official had passed to the Stasi official in Meckenheim three months earlier had still not been answered. From the western perspective, at least officially, the disappearance in Erfurt of \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" during the early summer of 1986 remained unexplained. Still the westerners did not give up. On 3 March 1988 Reinhard Renger, a senior official from the West German Ministry of Justice attending a diplomatic function at the West German mission in East Berlin sought out an old acquaintance from the East German Ministry of Justice and - still acting \\"unofficially\\" - took his colleague to one side. Renger explained that he knew that the terrorist Silke Maier-Witt was living under the name Gerlach in East Germany and he asked, confidentially, for help in finding her. As Renger pointed out, the situation as he had outlined it obviously could not be acceptable to the German Democratic Republic any more than to the German Federal Republic (\\"Das kann doch auch der DDR nicht genehm sein.\\"). To his astonishment, three months after that informal conversation Reinhard Renger received a brief reply. Headed \\"Verification of the person\\" (\\"√úberpr√ºfung der Person\\"), it stated simply that \\"... she is not staying in the German Democratic Republic\\" (\\"... da√ü sie sich nicht in der DDR aufh√§lt\\"). The reason for his astonishment was that in the past, when the German Democratic Republic found a question from the west inappropriate, they would simply have ignored it. The times really were changing. \\"Sylvia Beyer\\" A new look was mandated, involving a change of hair-style and make-up along with a new set of clothes: the Stasi paid. It was then decided that Silke Maier-Witt's slightly crooked nose might still lead to someone to recognise her, so - slightly unusually at that time - her nose was \\"straightened out\\". The Stasi paid for that too. As a further precaution, intended to make it harder for a future investogator to check out her background, the new identity provided by the Stasi stated that she had been born on 18 October 1948, in Moscow. In October 1986 \\"Sylvia Beyer\\" turned up as the new boss of the documentation and information centre at the VEB-Pharma factory in Neubrandenburg, far to the north of the city of Erfurt from which \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" had disappeared six months earlier. For the second time, Silke Maier-Witt had been prmitted to choose her new name for herself. To the casual listener \\"Sylvia\\" sounded rather like \\"Silke\\" and \\"Beyer\\" sounded rather like \\"Maier\\". On hearing the name she would, she reasoned, not react with a half second pause before recognition cut in, if someone addressed her by a name so similar to the one with which she had started life. She had been badly shaken by the loss of \\"Angelika Gerlach\\": \\"That was one of the worst experiences of my life, when I had to change my identity again [and] had to give up everything I had tried to build up as Angelika. That‚Äôs when I really suffered. If I died, I felt, nobody would care\\". Despite her shock over the loss of \\"Angelika Gerlach\\", she evidently settled to her new identity well enough. Beyer contributed several pro-government \\"Agitprop\\" articles to the staff journal at VEB-Pharma. \\"IM Anja Weber\\" During her time in East Germany Maier-Witt met up regularly with her Stasi confidants. A more significant meeting took place on 24 March 1984 when she took a trip to East Berlin. Her principal interlocutor was G√ºnter J√§ckel, who later became a colonel and deputy head of department within the State Security Ministry. \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" (as she was still known at this point) now became one of approximately 175,000 \\"informal co-workers\\" (\\"informeller Mitarbeiter)\\" / IMs) registered with the Ministry for State Security (\\"Stasi\\"). IMs were at the heart of a surveillance network which the authorities believed fundamental to the security of the state. Every citizen was subject to Stasi surveillance but certain categories of citizen, such as those in the public eye and those identified as potential dissidents and/or active church members were of particular interest. The new recruit took her duties seriously, providing regular reports on her colleagues and social contacts, paying particular attention to \\"political\\" remarks or discussions. IMs were identified in Stasi records by pseudonyms: Silke Maier-Witt's Stasi pseudonym was \\"Anja Weber\\". IMs were normally paid something for their reports, though a few committed idealists refused payment and there were also IMs who did what they did because they had been blackmailed into doing it. Towards the end of 1989, as East Germany moved towards democracy, many Stasi officials hastened to destroy the huge repositories of files on their fellow- citizens that had accumulated over the previous forty years. When this became apparent protestors broke into the Stasi buildings round the country in order to preserve the files as evidence for individuals who suspected they had been disadvantaged as a result of surveillance reports and for other future researchers. During 1989/90 Stasi files on Silke Maier Witt / \\"Angelika Gerlach\\" / \\"Sylvia Beyer\\" were destroyed. Scholars working at the Stasi Records Agency since 1990 have recreated her file, but it is impossible to assess how complete a record this provides of her IM career and contributions. Arrest Even after the denial from the East German authorities received in 1988 Federal Criminal Police (\\"Bundeskriminalamt\\") never closed their file on Silke Maier-Witt alias Angelika Gerlach. From somewhere their terrorism experts still had reason to believe that the lead remained \\"hot\\". As the \\"Peaceful Revolution\\" ran its course, in February 1990 an East German Volkspolizei delegation visited the headquarters of the West German Criminal Police department at Wiesbaden and the westerners took the opportunity to resubmit their request for administrative assistance with the case. Following the political deveopments of the previous half-year the East German police were by now working closely with their West German counterparts, and on 18 June 1990 \\"Sylvia Beyer\\" was arrested at her workplace in Neubrandenburg. It was a Monday afternoon. The head of the documentation and information centre at the VEB-Pharma showed absolutely no surprise when the arresting officer produced his identity card and followed him out of the building without any hesitation or show of resistance. She was the last of ten former RAF operatives to have been sought out and arrested in East Germany over the space of a few days. Trial Maier-Witt was now taken to West Germany. (Slightly less than four months later East Germany and West Germany ceased to exist when they were replaced by one reunified Germany.) On 8 October 1991 the high court in Stuttgart found her guilty of hostage-taking, extortion-based robbery and other charges connected with murder, attempted murder and theft. Three linked cases were cited. Silke Maier-Witt was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. Psychiatry and peace work While in prison she resumed her Psychology studies at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg. Released early in 1995 she was finally able to complete her course, after which she went on to work in the fields of child and adolescent psychiatry, counseling and communication. In 1999, having decided to become a peace worker, she wrote to the Federal (national) prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe to request backing. Despite her qualification as a psychologist-therapist, it was proving hard to find work as a freelancer once people recognised her name and recalled her face on the \\"wanted\\" poster ten and twenty years earlier. Requesting support from the public prosecutor was nevertheless a distinctly bold decision in view of the fact that during the 1970s lawyers from the West German prosecutor's office had repeatedly been targeted by the RAF. Her letter was marked for the attention of Kay Nehm, who at that time was head of the service. She assured him that \\"from me personally there is no threat\\" (\\"von meiner Person keine Bedrohung ausgeht\\"). Then case must have been well made, since the chief prosecutor in Karlsruhe reacted promptly. He confirmed to the applicant that since 1979 she had \\"plausibly distanced herself from the violence based ideology of the RAF\\". He advised the Ministry for Justice that there were \\"no reservations\\" (\\"keine Bedenken\\") over employing Maier-Witt as a peace worker and he personally wished the ex-terrorist \\"every success with her future plans\\" (\\"... viel Erfolg f√ºr Ihr Vorhaben\\"). Armed with Kay Nehm's letter of recommendation she applied successfully to the Cologne-based \\"ForumZVD\\" (\\"Forum Ziviler Friedensdienst \\") for training in peace work. Silke Maier-Witt worked for the \\"ForumZVD\\" (hands-on peace organisation) in Prizren (Kosovo) between 2000 and 2005, attempting to \\"reconcile the irreconcilable, the perpetrators with their victims\\". That was followed by six months in Skopje (Macedonia) trying to draw ethnic Albanians and Macedonians towards peaceful coexistence. It was, she said at the time, her way of delivering something useful from her own past. Others should learn from her mistakes: violence does not change a society. In 2006 the German Committee for Fundamental Rights and Democracy placed her in charge of a holidays project in Ulcinj. This was part of the broader internationally backed Holidays from war project for Albanian and Serbian young people from Kosovo. After Dark In March 2003 Silke Maier-Witt made an extended appearance on the British television programme After Dark, discussing terrorism with Albie Sachs, Mohammad al-Massari, Jim Swire and David Shayler among others. J√∂rg Schleyer In November 2017, slightly more than forty years after the murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer, Silke Maier-Witt met J√∂rg Schleyer, his youngest son, at the Marriott Hotel in her home town of Skopje. Their meeting, set up by reporters working for the tabloid newspaper Bild, lasted for more than seven hours. After the handshake Maier-Witt opened with a request: \\"It sounds so flat. But first I want to ask for forgiveness. It does not help much, but I think that it is something I have always been avoiding\\". Reporting on the meeting, the commentator Jan Feddersen wrote a thoughtful piece in the left-leaning Tageszeitung (daily newspaper). In it he offered his judgment that Silke Maier-Witt had become \\"the first former RAF member who had \\"seriously engaged with matters such as reconciliation, explanations, grief and a request for forgiveness\\". Afterwards J√∂rg Schleyer told reporters that for the first time, after forty years, he now knew, from the mouth of one of the convicted terrorists involved, the identities of the three terrorists who had been with his father when the fatal shots were fired. He expressed the hope that other criminals would follow Maier-Witt's example.  Looking back  Silke Maier-Witt is one of the very few people that were, during the 1970s, participants in the RAF inner circle, who is openly self-critical in respect of her past involvement. In 2011 she was called upon to testify before the Stuttgart-based high court in a re- examination of the fatal attack in 1977 on Siegfried Buback and two companions. The question at issue was whether the RAF member Knut Folkerts had actually pulled the trigger. Maier-Witt believed he had not, but was unable to support this with conclusive evidence, and she did not dispute his involvement regardless of whether or not he had been present at the killing. More broadly, she took the opportunity to make an appeal to former comrades in arms: \\"We are all old people now, and it no longer makes any sense to want to pursue a game of hide and seek\\". There was, besides, a moral duty \\"also towards the son of Mr. Bubeck, who has a right to know who it was [that killed his father]\\". In various interviews since her conviction and release Maier-Witt has drawn a connection between her own membership of a terror group and her father's of the Nazi-paramilitary \\"SS\\". She has never found out what her father actually did as an \\"SS man\\", but it is known that he did volunteer for membership when he was still very young: she senses that he, like she, must have been driven by a powerful urge to \\"belong\\" to a group, to be someone and to represent something larger than himself, even where the price to be paid involved disconnecting a part of his consciousness. And of course both the RAF and the SS had spread terror.

Its dedicated, multi-disciplinary health care team provides individualized and comprehensive care to all of its beneficiaries by using a combination of traditional medical services, alternative therapies, state-of-the-art technologies and modern drug therapy. Residing on the largest military installation on the East coast, the hospital serves approximately 150,000 active duty military personnel, retirees and family members.  History  Out of a 144-acre area of swamp, sand dunes, and snakes grew Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune over sixty-four years ago. With World War II already engulfing Europe, it became evident that facilities at Quantico and Parris Island were inadequate to meet Marine Corps plans for expansion on the east coast. After detailed reconnaissance, the vicinity of New River, North Carolina was determined to be the most suitable area for all elements of a Marine Division. On February 15, 1941 the Navy Department received approval to construct the East Coast Marine Corps Training Center that is now Camp Lejeune. Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune has a three-pronged mission -operational readiness, patient and family-centered care, and professional development. (U.S. Navy photo illustration by Danielle Bolton/Released) The peninsula known as Hadnot Point was selected as the site for the original Naval Hospital. Construction that began on March 13, 1942. By June, the first building was substantially complete and was turned over to Captain T. L. Morrow, MC USN, the Prospective Medical Officer in Command. On March 30, 1942, Chief Pharmacist V. M. Coulter, USN reported aboard and began preparing requisitions for the \\"several hundred thousand dollars\\" of medical equipment and supplies required to outfit the hospital. Captain J. F. Riordan, MC USN reported on May 14, 1942 to assume the duties as command officer. The Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune was commissioned May 1, 1943. Staff assigned to the hospital in May 1943 consisted of 51 Officers, 90 Navy Nurses, 270 Navy Corpsmen and 150 Civilian employees. The hospital reached its highest patient load of 2,087 during WWII. Beds were placed in passageways and double-deck bunks were used extensively. During the Korean War, the peak census was about 1,865, including many Army patients suffering from frostbite injuries. In July 1975 the current site was approved for construction of a new Naval Hospital. The contract for construction of the new hospital was finalized ground breaking took place in May 1979. In a Mast Stepping ceremony on July 21, 1982, silver dollars were placed at the base of the new hospital's flag poles. The placing of the coins, honoring the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Surgeon General, is taken from an ancient Roman custom. The tradition of placing coins at the foot of a ship's mast was said to ensure that the fare of all hands on board was paid for passage across the River Styx. The new hospital was built on a 162-acre site on the Northeast Creek at a cost of $46 million. In contrast to the old Hospital, the new hospital is a compact unit, consisting of a 4-story clinical and support building, with bed capacity at 205, expandable to 236. The surgical suite consisted of 5 operating rooms, and the Obstetrical Suite had 5 labor rooms and 3 delivery rooms. The cost to equip the new hospital was $8,200,000.00. Remarkably the move-in was accomplished in only two days from February 12 to 13, 1983. The dedication ceremony was held on May 12, 1983. The new hospital did not get the benefit of enjoying peaceful times. The bombing of the Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon in October 1983 was the first test of the new hospital's ability to respond to such an emergency. Over 50 wounded marines were received at the hospital over the ensuing weeks. When Iraq invaded the tiny Arab kingdom of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, the Naval Hospital was once again called upon to respond. Two hundred and forty-eight personnel from the Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune were deployed in support of \\"Operation Desert Storm.\\" Reporting on board to backfill and assist with casualty support were 412 Naval Reservists. The hospital received close to 400 Marines and Sailors evacuated from the Southwest Asia theater of operations. Life at Naval Hospital was forever changed on September 11, 2001, with the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In January 2002, Naval Hospital deployed 150 Doctors, Nurses and Corpsmen as Fleet Hospital 20, Joint Task Force 160 to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to establish medical facilities for detainees from the developing war on Iraq and a Global War on Terrorism. The hospital saw more and more deployments in support of \\"Operation Enduring Freedom\\" and \\"Operation Iraqi Freedom.\\" In January 2005, Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune became the primary casualty receiving facility when II MEF became the predominant force in theater in continuing OIF, receiving about 30 casualties of war, a month. Currently, the hospital has deployed staff in Afghanistan, Kuwait, Cuba, and the Horn of Africa, and, the proud staff of Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune consists of approximately 240 Officers, 600 Sailors, over 1000 civilians and contractors, and our many dedicated volunteers.

The area is themed to the Harry Potter media franchise, adapting elements from the film series and novels by J. K. Rowling. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was designed by Universal Creative from an exclusive license with Warner Bros. Entertainment. The first phase was officially announced for Islands of Adventure on May 31, 2007, and after a two-and-a-half-year construction period, the area officially opened to the public on June 18, 2010. The area's flagship ride is Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which exists within a re-creation of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It takes riders on a journey through Harry Potter's wizarding world. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter also contains Flight of the Hippogriff, a family roller coaster, and formerly included Dragon Challenge, a pair of inverted roller coasters, which was replaced in 2019 by a new roller coaster, Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure. The area also features a re-creation of Hogsmeade containing many gift shops and restaurants from the novels including Dervish and Banges, Honeydukes, Ollivanders, Zonko's Joke Shop (though it houses Honeydukes), the Three Broomsticks, and the Hog's Head. The second phase was initially announced on December 6, 2011, as a significant expansion of the existing Wizarding World of Harry Potter. On May 8, 2013, it was officially announced that a substantial portion of phase two would be constructed in the adjacent Universal Studios Florida theme park with a full scale working replica of the Hogwarts Express taking guests between the two lands. This phase's flagship ride is Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, a 3D dark ride/simulator based on Gringotts Bank, the wizarding bank that appears in the book and film series. Its design is similar to Transformers: The Ride and the Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man rides but built on a roller coaster track. The remaining features are themed around London and Diagon Alley. Diagon Alley officially opened on July 8, 2014. Background Previous attempts Rumors of a Harry Potter-themed area at a Universal Studios park or a Disney park started to circulate in 2003. However, the rights to the Harry Potter franchise had been acquired by Warner Bros., who denied all the rumors. In 2001, Time Warner used this license to construct and operate the Harry Potter Movie Magic Experience at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia; it was a small indoor walkthrough featuring many re-creations of locations in the first two movies. After two years of operation, it was removed. The Walt Disney Company and Universal entered bidding negotiations with Warner Bros. and Rowling for the theme park rights to Harry Potter in the United States. In 2004, Rowling signed a letter-of-intent with Disney, with the company intending to develop a Harry Potter section within the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World. Ultimately, Disney pulled out of negotiations, citing that Rowling's creative influence and the terms established by Warner Bros. were too stringent. Rumors and official announcement In January 2007, About.com reported a rumor from a \\"highly credible source\\" that the Lost Continent area within Universal's Islands of Adventure park was to be re-themed \\"to the stories and characters of one of the most popular children's franchises\\". Other sources followed up in the next few days with unofficial confirmation the new area would involve Harry Potter, and was being developed under the name \\"Project Strong Arm\\" in reference to the KUKA robotic arm technology it would utilise. Nikki Finke reported her own confirmation of the Potter park plans in April, followed shortly by a story in The Scotsman; both reports were widely relayed by other media sources. On May 31, 2007, Universal (in partnership with Warner Bros.) officially announced the addition recreating Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest and Hogsmeade, with a planned opening in 2009. Phase 1: Islands of Adventure Themed billboards were located around the Wizarding World during the two-year construction period. Construction of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter began seven months after the official announcement, in January 2008. By July, the Flying Unicorn and Enchanted Oak Tavern were closed. The Flying Unicorn then began an almost two-year refurbishment which transformed it into the Flight of the Hippogriff. The Enchanted Oak Tavern was later demolished. A bridge was built to connect The Lost Continent with Jurassic Park allowing guests to avoid the construction zone that was to become the Wizarding World. Construction progressed with the Hogwarts Castle slowly taking shape. By September 2008, the Dueling Dragons entrance was moved to Jurassic Park to make room for construction of Hogsmeade. One month later, the old entrance was demolished. By September 2009, the top shell of Hogwarts Castle was completed. On September 15, an announcement was made detailing what was going to be included in the Wizarding World. In early 2010, Universal increased its marketing of the area, which included newspaper advertisements, billboards and television commercials. The Dueling Dragons were closed for some maintenance before being transformed into the Dragon Challenge. Construction was completed by June 1, 2010, when the area began soft openings. A soft opening weekend was held for the media and reserved guests, starting on May 28, 2010. The park had two opening ceremonies that took place on June 16 and on June 18, 2010. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter's grand opening ceremony took place on June 16 with book series author J. K. Rowling, and film series actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, James and Oliver Phelps and Bonnie Wright, as well as Universal Orlando Resort officials, and representatives from the media. The ceremony, which was produced by Universal Orlando Events Production in conjunction with Thinkwell Group, concluded with a fireworks display and a performance by the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by original series' composer John Williams. On June 18, the second ceremony took place, which officially opened the Wizarding World of Harry Potter to the public. NBC's Today Show and The Weather Channel broadcast segments live from the park. Phase 2: Universal Studios Florida The opening of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter saw attendance at Islands of Adventure rise by as much as 36% in 2010. According to Jason Garcia of the Orlando Sentinel, this had resort executives pondering \\"when to expand Wizarding World and how to keep business balanced between Islands and Universal Studios Florida\\". In April 2011, Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times mentioned that rapid attendance growth led to speculation that The Wizarding World of Harry Potter would see a significant expansion, which would include Diagon Alley and a Gringotts-themed dark ride possibly replacing the Lost Continent themed area in Islands of Adventure. Demolition of the Jaws ride and the surrounding Amity in March 2012 On December 6, 2011, Universal Parks & Resorts confirmed expansion plans but did not reveal specific details. The announcement was made just four days after Universal revealed plans to permanently close the Jaws attraction. Following its closure the following month, the Los Angeles Times stated that the site of the former Jaws ride in Universal Studios Florida would be used for The Wizarding World of Harry Potter expansion, despite what previous speculation suggested. These rides would be complemented by a replica of the Hogwarts Express to move guests between the two parks. Demolition of the Jaws ride and the Amity area began almost immediately after their closure. After the site was leveled, work began on land reclamation in the area's former lagoon, as well as construction of a series of buildings including a large show building. Further details about the expansion of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter were announced on May 8, 2013. Officials confirmed that the expansion would be set predominantly in the adjacent Universal Studios Florida theme park, and would feature areas themed after Diagon Alley and London. The rumored Hogwarts Express connection between the two parks was also confirmed. Officials stated the expansion should open in 2014. On January 23, 2014, officials announced the name of the flagship roller coaster would be Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts. They also indicated that a two-park pass would be necessary to ride the Hogwarts Express, which was set to connect Universal Studios Florida with the existing Harry Potter area at Universal's Islands of Adventure. The official opening date of the Diagon Alley phase was announced at an exclusive and private press conference on June 17, 2014, for July 8, 2014. On June 18, 2014, the Diagon Alley red carpet premiere took place with Domhnall Gleeson, Bonnie Wright, Evanna Lynch, Matthew Lewis, James and Oliver Phelps, Tom Felton, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis and Helena Bonham Carter attending. New photos of Diagon Alley were later released the same night and the official opening date was announced publicly by Universal Orlando's president, Bill Davis. King's Cross station opened on July 1, 2014, as well as the Hogwarts Express Hogsmeade Station at Islands of Adventure and soft openings of Diagon Alley began on July 3, 2014. Diagon Alley officially opened on July 8, 2014. Attractions The Wizarding World of Harry Potter has four rides. Three rides opened in 2010 as part of phase one, while two additional rides opened in phase two in 2014. Dragon Challenge, one of the rides from the first phase, was closed permanently in 2017. Hogsmeade right Dragon Challenge was an inverted roller coaster featuring two distinct tracks that overlapped and intertwined with each other. The coaster predated the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, having operated under the name Dueling Dragons since the park's 1999 opening. The tracks remained the same, but were renamed in homage to the first task of the Triwizard Tournament where Harry and the other contestants are each to duel with a dragon, depicted in chapter 20 of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The two sides of the coaster were renamed \\"Hungarian Horntail\\" and \\"Chinese Fireball\\", after two of the dragon breeds which appear in the book. It was the only chasing inverted roller coaster in the world. The queue for this ride featured many Harry Potter relics, including the Goblet of Fire and the Triwizard Cup. In addition, the hike to the ride featured Ron Weasley's flying Ford Anglia from in the second film, as well as Hagrid's hut. Dragon Challenge closed on September 4, 2017 to make way for Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, which opened on June 13, 2019. Hogwarts Castle exterior of Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a dark ride inside the replica of Hogwarts Castle, simulating a tour of the castle and its surrounding grounds. Visitors initially walk through the castle, interacting with various characters and props from the Potter series, including a speech from Dumbledore, and directions from Harry, Hermione and Ron, before boarding a \\"magical bench\\" (controlled with a KUKA robotic arm system). Throughout the ride, guests are taken around the outside of the castle, using a combination of simulated flight as well as encountering realistic animatronic versions of the Whomping Willow, a horde of dementors, giant spiders, the Hungarian Horntail Dragon, and a Quidditch match. Flight of the Hippogriff is a steel roller coaster designed for families, located adjacent to Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. The ride opened in 2000 as the Flying Unicorn. Similar to the Dragon Challenge, this ride was re-themed prior to the opening of the Wizarding World. The roller coaster's back-story is that Hogwarts's Care of Magical Creatures professor, Hagrid, is teaching young wizards to fly on a hippogriff (as Harry does in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) by using a wicker replica of the creature. A recreation of Hagrid's Hut is passed on the way for a lesson from Hagrid himself on how to properly approach a hippogriff. Diagon Alley alt=Gringotts Bank, which houses Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts Diagon Alley's flagship ride is Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, a 3-D motion-based steel roller coaster dark ride based around Gringotts Bank, the wizarding bank in Diagon Alley. Riders enter the bank into the queue area where Blordak greets visitors and instructs them to continue past him to travel deep into the vaults of the bank to open an account. Unlike Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, this ride is hosted by Bill Weasley, played by Domhnall Gleeson, reprising his role from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 and Part 2. A completely functioning full- scale replica of the Hogwarts Express was created for the Diagon Alley expansion, connecting King's Cross Station at Universal Studios to the Hogsmeade station at Islands of Adventure, manufactured by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group in the form of a funicular railway people mover. The Hogwarts Express King's Cross Station features a wall between Platforms 9 and 10, where guests can \\"walk through\\" to get to Platform , like in the first film. Dining and shopping alt=Inside Ollivanders wand shop Other than the main rides, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is also home to gift shops and restaurants. Several of these are recreations of locations in the Harry Potter books while others have been created specifically for the park. A recreation of Hogsmeade is housed at Islands of Adventure while a recreation of Diagon Alley is housed at Universal Studios Florida. In the book series, Ollivanders wand shop is located in Diagon Alley, not Hogsmeade; however, installations of the shop are present in both areas of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The Hogsmeade area recreated the shop as \\"Ollivanders\\", portraying it as a branch of the original where Harry purchases his wand in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (known in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone). Unlike other shops in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, visitors are admitted in groups of 20 to experience the premise from the Potter series, that \\"the wand chooses the wizard\\". Similar to the first film, the wand keeper and a selected guest test a variety of wands until the right one is found. Effects include flowers drying out or a thunderstorm erupting inside the shop. Shoppers can then purchase souvenir wands. Hogsmeade Hogwarts Express locomotive greets guests when entering Hogsmeade A recreation of the Hogwarts Express lies at the entry to Hogsmeade. The recreation features \\"billowing steam and an iconic whistle\\" and is accompanied by the conductor of the train. In the Harry Potter series the Hogwarts Express is the train used to transport students from London to Hogwarts. The \\"Owl Post\\" is a working post office (where postcards and letters will be delivered with an authentic Hogsmeade postmark) that also sells stationery, writing implements, stamps, and owl-related gifts. Hogsmeade village as seen from Flight of the Hippogriff, pictured in September 2010. Part of the track of the former Dragon Challenge is seen in the upper left. \\"The Three Broomsticks\\", based on the inn and pub from the Harry Potter series, offers a variety of food and beverage items from the Harry Potter universe, including Butterbeer, pumpkin juice, strawberry-peanut butter ice cream (as seen in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), and chocolate Cauldron Cakes, in addition to a menu composed of traditional British fare (Shepherd's pie, fish and chips, etc.). The pub features many hidden references to the book, namely house elves and ghosts that roam the rafters. Butterbeer, which can be purchased with a souvenir mug, is offered as a non-alcoholic beverage and comes in both regular and frozen forms, found at the beginning of Hogsmeade fresh off the tap from the butterbeer cart. Similarly, The Hog's Head is based on the pub from the Harry Potter series owned by Aberforth Dumbledore. Honeydukes is a sweet shop, based on Honeydukes Sweetshop in the Harry Potter series. The shop sells many items from the Harry Potter universe including Chocolate Frogs, Acid Pops, exploding bonbons, Cauldron Cakes, treacle fudge, Fizzing Whizzbees, Pepper Imps, and Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. Various Harry Potter merchandise items can be purchased from two different gift shops in Hogsmeade. Dervish and Banges is a store selling magical items, as well as Quidditch supplies, Hogwarts clothing, and other merchandise. The store is based on Dervish and Banges in the Harry Potter series. The second shop is Filch's Emporium of Confiscated Goods. It is a general gift shop (named for Hogwarts caretaker Argus Filch) offering Hogwarts souvenirs (such as clothing and stationery), replicas of props from the Harry Potter films, and other toys and souvenirs. The shop is at the exit to Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, and is where guests can obtain photos of their ride experience. Diagon Alley Stairway located between the Magical Menagerie and Gringotts Bank Live events at Diagon Alley include the Knight Bus interactive show at the London waterfront; \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\\" and \\"The Tale of The Three Brothers,\\" which are puppet shows enacting stories from The Tales of Beedle the Bard; and live performances from musical group Celestina Warbeck and the Banshees (mentioned briefly by Molly Weasley in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets). Gringotts Money Exchange is able to exchange American currency for Wizarding bank notes. Diagon Alley features The Leaky Cauldron restaurant, The Hopping Pot, and Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, which specializes in Butterbeer-flavored ice cream. The Fountain of Fair Fortune is also a bar. Ollivander's Wand Shop sells interactive wands that activate features all around Diagon Alley, Quality Quidditch Supplies, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes joke shop, Magical Menagerie, Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, Wiseacre's Wizarding Equipment. Borgin and Burkes is the only shop located in Knockturn Alley. Reception The Wizarding World of Harry Potter has been well received by Harry Potter fans. Matt Blum of Wired stated \\"every detail is finely crafted to enhance the experience\\". An Orlando Sentinel article stated \\"muggles will love their Harry Potter adventure\\" but identifies the need for the park to offer Universal Express Passes due to large crowds. It also stated Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a truly one-of-a-kind experience that cannot easily be described. Leigh Caldwell from Traveling Mamas noted that although The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is ideal for the whole family, it's not designed for anyone under 3 years old.\\" She went on to consolidate others' comments about the area: \\"there is no doubt that fans of the Harry Potter books and movies are going to enjoy the heck out of a visit to the Wizarding World\\". Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, criticized the fact that the park was chosen to be in Orlando, rather than in London, stating that it was \\"utterly mad\\" to leave it to the Americans \\"to make money from a great British invention.\\" See also * The Wizarding World of Harry Potter * The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios Japan) * The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios Hollywood) * Warner Bros.

Through his life, Courtois was in close friendship with fellow student Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret, together with whom he maintained a fashionable studio in Neuilly-sur-Seine from the 1880s. He taught painting at Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, Acad√©mie Colarossi, Paris, where Harriet Campbell Foss, Georges d'Espagnat, Eva Bonnier, Emma Cheves Wilkins, and Dora Hitz were students. Courtois exhibited at the Salon de Paris, receiving a third-place medal in 1878 and a second-place medal in 1880. He was awarded a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle in 1889 and exhibited at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts from 1911 to 1914. He was made a Chevalier in the L√©gion d'Honneur. His paintings can be seen in the art galleries of Besan√ßon, Marseille, Bordeaux, and Luxembourg. He was a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.

The robbers used a stolen Bell 206 Jet Ranger as transport and landed on the rooftop of the G4S building. The police were unable to use their own helicopters to pursue the robbers since decoy bombs had been placed close to them. A 7-million-Swedish-krona reward was announced the following day for anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the robbers and/or the return of the stolen goods. This was the first robbery involving a helicopter in Swedish history. Events of September 23 *A Bell 206 helicopter is stolen from Roslagens helicopter base in Norrt√§lje. *The helicopter arrives at 5:15 (CEST) at the G4S cash service building. Three to four people land on the rooftop and break the reinforced glass window with a sledgehammer. Small bombs go off inside the building, likely to blow security doors open. No people are physically harmed. Bags of money are thereafter loaded into the helicopter. The sum is unknown. *The Swedish police arrive at 05:25 (CEST) but do not intervene, due to reports of the use of submachine guns. *The helicopter takes off from the rooftop at 05:35 (CEST) with all the robbers and the money on board. *Prior to the robbery, caltrops had been placed on the roads around the cash service building to prevent police cars from gaining access and decoy bombs were placed on the police helicopter base at Myttinge on the island of V√§rmd√∂. *The helicopter landed at Kanaanbadet. *The helicopter the robbers used is found at 08:15 (CEST) in the woods just outside a field at Skavl√∂ten in Arninge, twenty kilometers north of Stockholm. *Two JAS 39 Gripen were conducting a drill over the Baltic Sea and the Swedish Air Force offered assistance. It was turned down since the robbery was a civilian matter and not a military one.  Subsequent events  *Swedish police arrest six male suspects in connection with the robbery. They are listed as being aged 21 to 36, but otherwise unidentified in accordance with Swedish privacy law. *Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá claims that former members of the BIA Red Berets took part in the robbery. One month prior to the robbery, the Swedish embassy was allegedly given \\"certain information about a criminal group which was preparing a robbery\\" by Serbian police. One out of seven sentenced men were from Serbia. Arrests Swedish police quickly identified and arrested the suspects. Two days after the robbery, Safa Kadhum flew to Dominican Republic where he was arrested by local law enforcement on Swedish government's request. Swedish police immediately chartered a private plane to bring him back to Sweden. Alexander Eriksson instead flew to the Canary Islands. He was met at the airport by a special operations unit of the Swedish police. The police identified Goran Bojovic as the one who led the robbery. Sentences Seven men were sentenced to prison terms in October 2010 for their participation in the robbery. Three men were cleared of all charges and police suspect that another 10 may have been involved, but their identities are unknown. *Helicopter pilot Alexander Eriksson (Swedish) : 8 years' imprisonment *Robber Safa Kadhum (Iraqi): 8 years' imprisonment *Organizer Charbel Charro (Syrian): 5 years' imprisonment *Organizer Mikael S√∂dergran (Swedish) : 5 years' imprisonment *Organizer Goran Bojovic (Montenegro): 8 years' imprisonment *Falsified alibi provider Marcus Axelsson (Swedish): 2 years' imprisonment *Falsified alibi provider Tomas Broman (Swedish): 1 year's imprisonment In popular culture Swedish public television broadcaster Sveriges Television released a six-part Swedish-language documentary film called Helikopterr√•net.

It is popular for mountain biking, hiking, and hunting. The Rangers Headquarters were located on Gadpouch Road in East Hampton. History Meshomasic State Forest began as , acquired for $105.00 in 1903. It was the first State Forest in Connecticut, and the second in the country (Pennsylvania had the first). The forest was originally purchased to provide private landowners with examples of good Forest management practices. During the Great Depression two Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps were located on the forest.http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2697&Q;=322834 Connecticut Route 2, connecting Hartford and Norwich, was built in the 1950s and 1960s and runs through the state forest from Exit 10 to Exit 12. Ecology and geology The state forest's second-growth forest is typical of the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion. The forest is a mix of deciduous trees and white pine. One stand of white pine, referred to as the ‚Äúbig pines‚Äù, contains pines over 100 years old. The forest floor is scattered with boulders and large rocks from the last ice age, and the topography of the region is mostly shaped from glaciers from the last ice age. Cobalt, quartzite, and feldspar are abundant in the state forest, along with gold discovered by geologists at the University of Connecticut in the 1980s, which was found to be unexploitable.https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/08/science/gold-lures- geologists-to-connecticut.html?&pagewanted;=1 The highest point in the Meshomasic State Forest is Meshomasic Mountain at above sea-level. There are several other hills reaching 800 and . Great Hill, which overlooks Great Hill Pond and the Connecticut River, is part of the Bald Hill Range which runs through the state forest. Kongscut Mountain, known locally as Rattlesnake Mountain, is located in between Goodale Hill Road and Ash Swamp Road on a small section of Meshomasic State Forest land in East Glastonbury. The rocky forested terrain of the Meshomasic State Forest is home to the largest population of timber rattlesnakes in Connecticut. The timber rattlesnake is an endangered species in Connecticut and it is illegal to kill, harass, or collect. Bites are extremely rare in Connecticut and every bite in the Meshomasic State Forest has been treated in time.> Forest management The Meshomasic State forest was originally purchased to provide private landowners with examples of good forest management. The current management goals for the forest include maintaining a quality water supply for the Portland town reservoir (located within the state forest), protecting timber rattlesnake habitats, and keeping the forest as a showplace for proper timber management. Currently, about per year are harvested. This is a sustainable rate of harvest that also increases biodiversity in the forest and makes the forest more resistant to such disasters as uncontrolled wildfire and destructive insect outbreaks. The ‚Äúbig pines‚Äù are left alone and occasionally maintained to give the appearance of a virgin forest. In the late 19th century and again in the 1940s two quarries in the Meshomasic State Forest were quarried for feldspar and mica. The quarries are still open to the public and rock collectors to explore. From the early 1950s to 1970s Nike Missile Site HA-36 was located off of North Mulford Road in the Meshomasic State Forest. It was one of over 300 missile-defense sites around major cities during the Cold War. Nike Ajax anti- aircraft missiles were located at HA-36 to protect Hartford's aircraft industry from Soviet bombers.http://www.meetup.com/Forever- Young/calendar/9396929/ Portland Reservoir, Reeves Lookout State Wildlife Area, Meshomasic State Forest, Portland, CT. Recreation There are eight miles (13 km) of well-maintained dirt roads, originally built by the CCC, open for seasonal driving in the forest. Hunting, mountain biking, off roading, and hiking are also permitted in the forest. A public shooting range operated by the CT DEP is located within the State Forest off of Toll Gate Road in Glastonbury. Camping is not permitted within the state forest. The blue-blazed Shenipsit Trail, maintained by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, runs North-South through Connecticut. It starts in the Shenipsit State Forest just north of Soapstone Mountain and ends in the Meshomasic State Forest on Gadpouch Road. The trail runs along a ridge in the southern part of the forest where there are several vistas overlooking the Connecticut River, nearby Middletown, and the surrounding forest. 12 of the trail's are within the Meshomasic State Forest.

The argument is that these individuals are young and in good health, so they have a low risk of experiencing substantial health issues that would lead to large amounts of spending on health care. Further, this group tends to have a mentality of ‚Äúit won‚Äôt happen to me‚Äù with regards to most causes of injury. Together, these beliefs lead to the young invincibles not purchasing insurance. Insurance market effects There are risks associated with the young invincibles choosing to operate outside of the health insurance market, stemming from the economic phenomenon of adverse selection. Adverse selection is a principle describing the situation where people purchase insurance based on their expected use. People who anticipate using the most medical services purchase the most generous insurance plans, while people who do not expect to use many medical services are inclined not to purchase insurance at all. Due to the risk-spreading design of insurance, the adverse selection associated with the young invincibles leads to higher premiums for people who choose to purchase health insurance. As insurance premiums rise, more healthy people decide that it is not worth the higher prices, and drop out of the market, leading to what is called the \\"adverse selection death spiral.\\" By contrast, if young adults purchase insurance but continue to utilize very little health care services, the money they pay in premiums can go towards support the expenditures of people utilizing many health care services. The Affordable Care Act and young adults This problem of ballooning health insurance premiums has persisted for years, and was important in the debate over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called the Affordable Care Act (ACA). One set of ACA provisions eliminated the insurance industry‚Äôs ability to charge different premiums to people with differing health status and the ability to exclude individuals with pre-existing conditions. Implemented alone, these provisions would greatly increase the risk in the health insurance market, and premiums would increase to cover associated increases in expenditure. Therefore, the ACA includes a number of provisions aimed at incentivizing young invincibles to enter into the health insurance market. Individual mandate. The individual mandate applies to young adults and young adults may be eligible for a premium tax credit, lowering or eliminating the cost of insurance. This is particularly significant for young adults because they disproportionately compose those with incomes between 133-400% of the Federal Poverty Line who are entering the workforce for the first time. It is estimated that approximately nine million young adults ages 18‚Äì34 could be eligible for a subsidy. Dependent coverage. Legislation requires family insurance plans with dependent coverage to extend this coverage until young adults reach the age of 26. Prior to the ACA, most employer-based health insurance plans stopped dependent coverage when the child turned 18 or 19, or had graduated from college. Effective September 23, 2010, young adults can join or remain on their parents‚Äô insurance plans even if they are married, not living with their parents, attending school, financially independent from their parents, or eligible to enroll in an employer‚Äôs insurance plan. The coverage extension applies to both employer-based and private plans. Catastrophic coverage. Adults who are under the age of 30 and have experienced certain hardship may qualify for a cheaper ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù health plan. The catastrophic health plan is meant to protect young adults from very high medical costs. Purchased through the Exchanges, the plan covers three primary care visits per year at no cost to the individual and covers free preventive services. Reasons for exemption vary, such as homelessness or experience of domestic violence, and some require documented proof, such as an eviction or foreclosure notice. However, regardless of income, young adults must pay the standard price for the catastrophic plan (i.e., individuals purchasing these plans are not eligible for lower monthly premiums or lower out-of-pocket costs based on income). Other provisions. Many other ACA provisions are also relevant to young adults and effectively encourage young adults to buy insurance: ¬∑ The expansion of Medicaid, if universally adopted, could cover nearly 7.8 million young adults under the age of 35. As of December 11, 2013, 25 states and the District of Columbia planned to expand their Medicaid programs beginning in 2014. ¬∑ As with other individuals, young adults cannot be denied health coverage due to a pre-existing condition. Challenges to enrollment The White House faces the challenge of proving the value of health insurance to at least 2.7 million young invincibles who have historically been under-represented in the insurance pool. Many studies reporting on this effort conclude that insurance may be too great an expense and provide too little benefit to healthy young adults, making them willing to pay the penalty instead. Analysis suggests that healthy young adults who opt out of insurance could spend an average of five times less on health care than those who sign up for insurance. Another barrier to enrolling young adults is political or ideological opposition to the ACA. As health care reform under the ACA is closely associated with the Obama Administration and the Democratic Party, some young Americans may base their support on political affiliation. Political groups opposed to reform have developed campaigns encouraging young adults to refrain from purchasing insurance in the Marketplaces. One example is Generation Opportunity‚Äôs digital and grassroots ‚ÄúOpt-Out‚Äù initiative. Efforts to enroll young adults were impeded as this subset of the population and people across the United States had great difficulty in accessing and using Healthcare.gov (the site intended to help people enroll in the Federally facilitated Exchange) during the initial enrollment launch in 2013. Outreach and enrollment strategies Campaigns. Leading up to and throughout the first annual enrollment period, health insurance Marketplaces and advocacy groups released social media and other forms of campaigns. Many of these campaigns were aimed at encouraging young adults in particular to sign up for insurance. Examples include Covered California‚Äôs ‚ÄúTell a Friend - Get Covered‚Äù and ‚ÄúGot Insurance,‚Äù a project of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and ProgressNow Colorado. Maryland‚Äôs Maryland Health Connection partnered with 2013 Super Bowl champions, the Baltimore Ravens, to connect with residents on the importance of developing a ‚Äúhealth coverage game plan.‚Äù The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) developed a series of e-cards for parents to send to their children as a reminder to sign up before the enrollment deadline. Celebrity endorsements. Celebrities including pop icon Lady Gaga, singers Adam Levine and John Legend, and actresses Olivia Wilde and Amy Poehler, have shown public support for the ACA and Marketplace enrollment via Twitter and other social media outlets. National Youth Enrollment Day. A National Youth Enrollment Day launched on February 15, 2014. The initiative was led by the non-profits Young Invincibles and Get Covered America. Enrollment figures (2013-2014) ;Federally facilitated exchange. Initial enrollment data from the Department of Health and Human Services show that young adults are signing up for plans in the Federally facilitated Exchange. Numbers from the first quarter of Marketplace activity (October 1, 2013 to December 28, 2013) demonstrated that nearly one-quarter (24%) of the population who had selected a Marketplace plan were between the ages of 18 and 34, reflective of the proportion of young adults making up the same age group in the general population. An eight-fold increase was observed in the cumulative number of 18- to 34-year-olds who signed up for a marketplace plan in the last month of the reported period. At the same time, the Commonwealth Fund‚Äôs Affordable Care Act Tracking Study revealed that 41% of visitors to Marketplaces were between the ages of 19 and 34, suggesting that overall enrollment numbers would continue to increase as the March 31, 2014 deadline approached. ;State Marketplaces. At the state level, initial Marketplace enrollment data for young adults generally reflected that of the Federally facilitated Exchange. Most states reported 21-27% participation by this key age group. States at lower extremes included Arkansas, Arizona and New Mexico, with initial enrollment rates by young adults hovering between 17-18%. Massachusetts and the District of Columbia are among those reporting higher initial rates of enrollment by young adults, at 31% and 43%, respectively.

These pipes divert water downstream while allowing beavers to continue to build their dams to whatever size they choose. This photo shows beaver pipes constructed at Enzo Creek Nature Sanctuary, a private nature sanctuary near Big Rapids, Michigan. Beaver Pipes are a non-destructive flow devices, a way of controlling beaver activity in an ecosystem. The process of building beaver pipes is quite simple, and often serves as a permanent way to prevent beavers from damming water. Enzo Creek Nature Sanctuary Managers of the watershed of the Enzo Creek Nature Sanctuary experienced the all too common problem with beavers: their tenacious desire to dam water. The water level at Enzo Creek Nature Sanctuary had been growing year after year, impacting the fauna in Hunt Marsh, an wetland which serves as both a waterfowl nesting area and refuge. Managers physically removed the dams from Enzo Creek, the only outlet to the watershed; however, beavers would quickly work to rebuild them. Lethal removal of beavers from the marsh was contrary to the mission of the sanctuary, so the non-lethal method of beaver pipes was approved and adopted. Overview The construction of these beaver pipes at Enzo Creek Nature Sanctuary was a two-day project for one person and involved the following steps: # Slowly lower the water level behind the dam. # Insert pipes across the notch. # Allow the beavers complete the project.

Fieldhouse is a critic of the theories of imperialism put forward in the early 20th century by John A. Hobson and Lenin. He argues that they used superficial arguments and weak evidence. Fieldhouse says that the \\"obvious driving force of British expansion since 1870\\" came from explorers, missionaries, engineers, and empire-minded politicians. They had little interest in financial investments. Hobson's approach was to say that faceless financiers manipulated everyone else. \\"The final determination rests with the financial power.\\" Lenin made the argument that capitalism was in its last stages and had been taken over by monopolists. They were no longer dynamic and sought to maintain profits by even more intensive exploitation of protected markets. Fieldhouse rejects these arguments as unfounded speculation.David K.

She lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan with her husband, conductor-cellist David Lockington, music director laureate of the Grand Rapids Symphony. They have four children. Jenson is the sister of Vicky Jenson, an animated film story board artist and director.. Retrieved April 9, 2014. Child prodigy Dylana Jenson was a child prodigy. She studied violin with her mother beginning at age two and ten months. She then studied with the prominent violin teacher Manuel Compinsky, the internationally renowned concert violinist Nathan Milstein and the preeminent violin pedagogue Josef Gingold. She made her debut at age eight, playing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. At age nine, she appeared on a Jack Benny television special, re-enacting Benny's famous duet with Gisele MacKensie. At age eleven, she performed the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. On January 17, 1973 Dylana played David Popper's Concert Polonaise for a nationwide audience on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, preceding a comical violin solo by comedian Jack Benny. By age thirteen, she had performed with many of the leading orchestras in the U.S., including the New York Philharmonic in Avery Fisher Hall (Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts), and the Los Angeles Symphony. She toured Europe, Latin America and the Soviet Union.In 1978, at age seventeen and already a seasoned concert performer, she shared the silver medal in the International Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow. Later career Jenson made her Carnegie Hall concert debut on December 9, 1980, playing the Sibelius Violin Concerto with the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of Eugene Ormandy. The performance was received with great acclaim. In 1981, she recorded the Sibelius Violin Concerto and the Saint-Sa√´ns Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra for RCA Red Seal. That performance is still regarded as one of the finest recordings of the Sibelius Concerto. Music critic Edward Downes characterized her work as \\"unsurpassed since Heifetz.\\" Before her marriage, Jenson had the long-term loan from a wealthy violin collector of a 1743 Guarnerius del Gesu violin, the instrument with which she made the Sibelius recording. When she announced to her benefactor that she was to marry, she was given a short time in which to return the instrument because, he told her, if she was to marry she was not serious about a career as a concert performer. Eventually, however, Yo Yo Ma, the preeminent cellist of his era, referred her to Samuel Zygmuntowicz, a contemporary master violin maker in Brooklyn who has made sound-alike copies of great antique Stradivarius and Guarnerius violins for such violin superstars as Isaac Stern and Joshua Bell., In 1995 Jenson commissioned a violin from Zygmuntowicz based on a Guarnerius del Gesu model. This was the instrument used in the recorded Carnegie Hall concert and the Shostakovitch/Barber CD recording. In 2000, she was named Distinguished Professor of Music at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan. As of 2014, she is no longer listed as a faculty member. In addition to her teaching career, Jenson has continued her performance career, albeit with a less heavy schedule than the most famous concert artists and usually with regional rather than top-ranked orchestras. She often performs with the Grand Rapids Symphony under the direction of her husband. These performances have included, in 2005, a triumphant return to Carnegie Hall. One critic, Harris Goldsmith of the New York Concert Review, said of this performance: \\"In Jenson‚Äôs hands, even lyrical passages had an intense, tremulous quality... a sizzling performance. I can give no higher praise than to say that her excellent performance brought to mind, and was a loving tribute to, the great Nathan Milstein... who was one of Jenson‚Äôs mentors.\\" Jenson has also appeared in the past few years with the Baltimore Symphony, the Santa Barbara Symphony, Indian Hill Orchestra (Littleton, MA), the Louisiana Philharmonic, the New Mexico Symphony, and at the Berkshire, Eastern, and other famous music festivals. She has made tours of Australia and Japan and was made an Honorary Citizen at the age of 12 for her contributions to music in Costa Rica. Jenson plays recitals as well as concerts. Discography Following her 1978 Tchaikovsky Competition medal, a live performance of the Sibelius Violin Concerto was released on the Soviet Melodiya label. Jenson's 1981 recording of the Sibelius Violin Concerto with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra was among the first of RCA Red Seal's first major classical music production recorded in digital sound. This recording received a Grammy nomination in 1982. The album was later reissued on the RCA Victrola label and has been reissued on a customer order basis by Arkivmusic.com as part of its historical reissue series. Jenson in 1982 recorded the Brahms Violin Sonata No. 1 and 3 in with pianist Samuel Sanders for RCA Red Seal. The 2005 Carnegie Hall performance was recorded in its entirety and published by the Grand Rapids Symphony; it includes Jenson performing the Goldmark Violin Concerto No. 1. In 2008 Jenson recorded the Shostakovich 1st Violin Concerto and the Samuel Barber Violin Concerto with the London Symphony Orchestra, played on the Zygmuntowicz violin.

One night, a killer in a blonde wig murders Gloria's friend Kim with a pitchfork outside Gloria's house. Her paraplegic neighbor Mark witnesses it and calls Gloria to alert her, but she finds nothing outside. The killer takes pictures of Kim's body in front of Gloria's modeling shots, send her the photos, which are found by her assistant, Evelyn. When Kim's body is found in a dumpster, copies of Pussycat start selling out because Kim was on the cover. Gloria's brother Tony does a photoshoot for Pussycat with Sabrina. They try to have sex that night but Tony has impotency issues. After he leaves, the killer shows up in a beekeeper suit and releases bees which, attracted to Sabrina's perfume, proceed to sting her to death. The killer takes more pictures, sends them to Gloria, who recognizes the picture of her in the background. She confronts Roberto, the photographer who tells her that the only negatives he had were stolen a while back. Flora, an old acquaintance of Gloria's, attempts to buy Pussycat and Gloria eventually agrees to sell in the hopes that it will bring an end to the murders. Tony introduces Gloria to his new girlfriend Susan, and they scout out her department store for a photoshoot. They become separated and Gloria finds Tony's body on the escalator. The killer taunts her over the PA system. She escapes down the freight elevator, where she finds Susan's body. However, when the police arrive both the bodies have been removed. The killer sends Gloria some more photos, and later Evelyn finds Susan's dead body in her car. The cops show up at Roberto's residence to question him and find the backdrops of Gloria. They call Gloria to warn her right as Roberto shows up at her house. She runs from him, he chases after and gets hit by a car which kills him and then drives off. The cops conclude that he was the killer and consider the case closed. Gloria sells the magazine to Flora and returns home to find out that Evelyn has quit the magazine. She then finds Tony's body floating in her swimming pool, and starts to put together the clues. The killer taunts her again, inside her home.

Preferring more fantastical films like Demons. This led to Bava to explore the notion of the killer's point of view in Delirium, which involved showing the killer's perception of his victims by giving them grotesque visual features. This ranges from one woman having a giant eyeball for a face while another had the appearance of a bee. Bava stated this was one of the few films he had time and budget to get the results he desired for the film. Release Delirium was released in Italy on 3 April 1987.

Soedradjad Djiwandono (EYD: Sudrajad Jiwandono, also written Sudrajad Djiwandono, Soedradjat Djiwandono and Sudrajat Djiwandono; born 7 August 1938) is an Indonesian economist who was Governor of Bank Indonesia, the nation's central bank, from 1993 until his sudden dismissal in 1998. Djiwandono received his bachelor's degree in economics from Gadjah Mada University in 1963 and went on to receive a Ph.D. from Boston University in 1980. Prior to accepting the position as Governor of Bank Indonesia in 1993, Djiwandono had expressed his concern about the high number of bad debts in the banking sector to President Suharto. Career Soedradjad Djiwandono held a wide range of economic positions, both outside of and within government, before becoming Governor of Bank Indonesia in 1993. His main positions included the following: * Professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, a Graduate School of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore * Researcher, Institute of Economics and Social Research, Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) * Lecturer, and later Professor, Department of Economics, University of Indonesia * Bureau Head, National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) * Special Assistant to the Minister of Trade * Assistant Minister, Coordinating Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry * Junior Minister for Trade Asian financial crisis The Asian financial crisis began to affect Indonesia by mid-1997. On 14 August, Bank Indonesia followed Thailand and Malaysia and moved to float the Indonesian rupiah. Under Djiwandono, the bank's \\"market- oriented response\\" to the crisis was praised by investors. However, it was also criticized for allowing Indonesia's banking system to grow too fast with 239 banks in establishment by September 1997. Of these banks, 16 were liquidated in November. Djiwandono later defended the decision not to close more banks citing concerns that \\"had more banks been liquidated, a total collapse [of the banking sector] may have resulted\\". He was dismissed from office by Suharto's 11 February 1998 presidential decree but was not officially informed of the decision until six days later. Although no reason was given, economists believed Djiwandono's opposition to a new fixed exchange rate system for the rupiah contributed to the decision for his dismissal. The decision drew criticism from the International Monetary Fund and United States President Bill Clinton and placed a US$43 billion aid package at risk of being reversed. He was succeeded by Syahril Sabirin in a transfer ceremony on 19 February. Career since leaving office On 7 May 2002, Djiwandono was named a suspect in the investigation of former Bank Indonesia governors. He was charged with abuse of authority by extending Rp19 trillion (US$2.1 billion) in loans to failing banks between 1996 and 1998. Several years earlier, Djiwandono had defended the central bank's policies from allegations by three former finance ministers that it misunderstood the government's policies and improperly used the liquidity assistance program during the financial crisis. He remained free while various investigations of the approach of former Bank Indonesia governors was undertaken. Djiwandono continues to contribute to public policy debate, especially in Indonesia, by writing articles including op-ed pieces about current economic issues, particularly about matters involving monetary policy.J. Soedradjad Djiwandono,'Quantitative easing and Asia: concerns over new monetary easings', The Jakarta Post, 12 October 2012, and J.

Personal life  Soedradjad, a Catholic, is married to Bianti, daughter of Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, one of Indonesia's most well-known economists and policy-makers. He is thus connected by marriage to two of Sumitro's sons: Prabowo Subianto, who ran for the presidency of Indonesia in 2014 and is running in 2019, and Hashim Djojohadikusumo, a prominent business figure in Indonesia. Soedradjad and Bianti have two sons: Thomas Acquinas Muliatna Djiwandono (born 7 May 1972) and G. Budisatrio Djiwandono (born 25 September 1981). He had at least one brother, J. Soedjati Djiwandono.

Stettner is a computer engineer and architect who is most widely known for Unix development and for spearheading the native VAX version of UNIX, Ultrix, during his tenure at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Biography Stettner started working with UNIX while at Bell Labs Murray Hill and later moved to DEC where he worked for Bill Munson and with Fred Canter and Jerry Brenner to start DEC's UNIX Engineering Group. While his focus was kernel development, he also designed and produced the original UNIX \\"Live Free or Die\\" license plate and the original Ultrix poster based on Phil Foglio's UNIX T-shirt as designed by Mike O'Brien. Originally a marketing promotion, Stettner obtained the actual vanity plate from the state of New Hampshire in 1982 after Bill Shannon left to join Sun Microsystems. With Bill Shannon, Stettner was responsible for establishing near-realtime UUCP-based connections between University of California, Berkeley and Duke University through their system known as decvax. Stettner later established near-realtime netnews and email feeds news feeds to Europe, Japan and Australia. At a conference, he relayed the conversation during a budget review with financial department staff of the nearly $250,000 in phone bills attributed to his department's timesharing computer (known as decvax) explaining that these were computers talking. That seemed to satisfy the finance people. Stettner ported UNIX to DEC's symmetric multiprocessing VAX-11/782 hardware system, though based upon Purdue University's asymmetric kernel. The kernel supported symmetric multiprocessing while not being fully multithreaded and based upon pre-Ultrix work by Stettner and earlier work by George H. Goble at Purdue University. There was liberal use of locking and some tasks could only be done by a particular CPUs (e.g. the processing of interrupts). This was not uncommon in other SMP implementations of that time (e.g. SunOS). Stettner proposed and led DEC's VAX UNIX development resulting in Ultrix-32 and was its architect and engineering manager, overseeing the project through its beta trials. Stettner then went to Palo Alto to start DEC's Palo Alto, CA-based workstation engineering group under Steve Bourne. There, he suggested the creation of an early collaborative organization for developing open Unix standards as a response to collaboration between AT&T; and Sun Microsystems. That organization became the Open Software Foundation (OSF). Shortly thereafter, to more effectively compete with Sun Microsystems, Stettner was part of a team of five DEC employees (with James Billmaier, Joe DiNucci, Mario Paglario, and Skip Garvin) who proposed a UNIX-only workstation product line based upon the MIPS architecture. He was one of the original members of the product design team for the MIPS R2000-based RISC-based DECstation 3100 core design team. Armando later designed a real-time Shuttle tracking system using down-linked telemetry for Kennedy Space Center as late part of NASA's Return to Flight program. The system was later implemented by Computer Sciences Corp. Armando Left DEC in 1990. He went on to positions in management consulting, as a technologist at Sun Microsystems, in the office of CTO at Aetna, and other positions. Starting in 2000, Stettner went to Seattle to work as employee #3 for Paul Allen's Digeo. In 2004, Stettner led IPTV development at Digeo and from 2006 through 2011 was director of FiOS Advanced Development at Verizon. He then worked as vice president of engineering for Gigabit Squared. In 2012 he was one of the technology professionals who signed an open letter opposing the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.

The screenplay by Jo Swerling is based on the 1924 play Ladies of the Evening by Milton Herbert Gropper, which ran for 159 performances on Broadway.Ladies of the Evening details, Internet Broadway Database; accessed January 26, 2016. The film is about an artist from a wealthy family who hires a \\"party girl\\" as his model. As they get to know each other, the girl begins to regret her past, and the two fall in love, but they must face his family's strong opposition to their union. Ladies of Leisure received generally positive reviews, and Stanwyck's performance was praised by critics. The success of the film made Stanwyck a star.Osborne, Robert. Outro remarks on the Turner Classic Movies presentation of Ladies of Leisure (December 5, 2012) Plot Aspiring artist, Jerry Strong, the son of a wealthy railroad tycoon, sneaks out of a party he allowed his friend Bill Standish to hold at his New York City penthouse apartment and studio. While out driving in the country, Jerry meets self-described \\"party girl\\" Kay Arnold, who is escaping from another party aboard a yacht, and gives her a ride back to the city. He sees something in her and offers her a job as his model for a painting titled \\"Hope\\". In their first session, Jerry wipes off her makeup to try to bring out her true nature. Perpetual partier and drunkard Standish thinks Kay looks fine just the way she is and invites her on a cruise to Havana. She declines his offer. As they get to know each other better, Kay falls in love with Jerry and comes to rue her tawdry past. This is reflected in her face, and she finally achieves a pose Jerry finds inspiring. He paints so late into the night that he offers to let her sleep on his couch. The next morning, Jerry's father John shows up and demands he dismiss Kay and marry his longtime fianc√©e Claire Collins. John found out all about Kay's checkered background and she does not deny the facts. When Jerry refuses, John cuts off all relations with his stubborn son. Kay decides to quit anyway for Jerry's benefit. This forces him to declare he loves her. She suggests running off to Arizona. Jerry's mother comes to see Kay. Though Kay convinces her that she genuinely loves Jerry, Mrs. Strong still begs her to give him up for his own good. Kay tearfully agrees and makes plans to go to Havana with Bill Standish. Her roommate and good friend, Dot Lamar, races to tell Jerry, but by the time she reaches him, the ship has sailed. Despondent, Kay tries to commit suicide by leaping into the water. When she awakens in the hospital, Jerry is waiting at her bedside.

Cohn assigned the director to adapt Ladies of the Evening, a melodrama David Belasco had produced on Broadway in late 1924, and after Capra completed a first draft screenplay he invited Jo Swerling - a playwright from New York who had been brought to Hollywood by Cohn - to work on the script. Swerling initially declined because he thought it was a \\"putrid piece of gorgonzola\\", \\"inane, vacuous, pompous, unreal, unbelievable ‚Äì and incredibly dull\\", but decided to work on it nonetheless. \\"I went to my hotel, locked myself in my room and for five days pounded out a rewrite story of the plot I'd heard, interrupting the writing only long enough for black coffee, sandwiches and brief snatches of sleep\\", the screenwriter later recalled. \\"I was simply writing a newspaper yarn with a longer deadline than usual.\\"McBride 1992, pp. 212‚Äì20. Despite the fact her three previous films had been critical and commercial failures, Cohn was intent on casting Stanwyck as Kay, but the actress was on the verge of returning to her theatrical roots in New York City. She agreed to meet with Capra, who had another actress in mind, but the interview went badly. Stanwyck's husband, actor Frank Fay, became furious when Stanwyck returned home crying and called Capra to complain. The director was surprised by her reaction, saying she had acted as if she did not want the part. Fay urged him to screen a film test she had made for The Noose at Warner Bros., and Capra was so impressed by it he urged Cohn to sign her immediately. When filming began, Capra quickly learned Stanwyck was unlike any actress he previously had directed. In his autobiography The Name Above the Title, he recalled: Capra previously had worked with cinematographer Joseph Walker on four silent films. The director was impressed not only with Walker's artistic vision, but his various camera-related inventions as well.McBride 1992, p. 189. He not only ground his own lenses, but he used a different one for each of the actresses he photographed. Many of the elements typical of Capra films ‚Äì the backlighting of actresses, the transformation of minimal sets into dreamlike images, the delicate night scenes and erotic rain scenes ‚Äì were suggested to Capra by Walker.McBride 1992, p. 215. The two collaborated on twenty projects between 1928 and 1946.McBride 1992, p. 190. Ladies of Leisure was filmed from December 1929 to January 1930, at Columbia's studios and on location at Malibu Lake. The film should not be confused with Columbia's 1926 silent film of the same name, directed by Tom Buckingham and starring Elaine Hammerstein; however Capra's film was also released in a silent version for theaters not equipped for sound.\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com Both of Capra's silent and sound versions are held by the Library of Congress. The film was remade in 1937 by Columbia as Women of Glamour, starring Virginia Bruce and directed by Gordon Wiles. Critical reception Following the film's premiere on April 5, 1930, Photoplay magazine reported that halfway through the showing, the audience \\"choked up\\" and that \\"something was happening ... a real, beautiful, thrilling wonder had been born.\\" The Photoplay article continued: In his review for The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall praised the film for \\"its amusing dialogue, the restrained performances of nearly all the players and a general lightness of handling that commends the direction of Frank Capra.\\"New York Times review Hall concluded, \\"The picture is sufficiently variegated in drama and more amusing moments to be attractive film fare.\\" The review in Variety was less positive, noting that Stanwyck \\"delivers the only really sympathetic wallop of the footage\\" and \\"saves the particular picture with her ability to convince in heavy emotional scenes.\\" TV Guide rated the film 2¬Ω out of four stars and noted, \\"Capra kept everyone under tight rein and any tendency to emote was admirably stifled under his firm direction.\\"TV Guide review Awards and honors When the film was released, Capra was convinced that it would garner Academy Award nominations for himself and Stanwyck, and possibly even for best film. When it failed to get a single nomination, both he and Columbia studio head Harry Cohn were outraged and sent angry letters to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. As a result, Capra became a member of the Academy, but wanting more, campaigned to be one of the institution's board of governors, and was elected to a three-year term.Madsen, Axel.

Retrieved September 25, 2009 The hotel is named for its founder, William Balser \\"Bill\\" Skirvin, whose daughter, Perle Mesta, became the ambassador to Luxembourg under Harry Truman. The hotel closed in 1988 and sat abandoned for most of the next 19 years, until it was renovated and re- opened as part of the Hilton chain of hotels in 2007. The renovation project restored the original exterior finish, installed historically accurate windows, reconfigured guest rooms and added new guest elevators. The process to return the hotel to life started nearly a decade earlier, however, when, in 1999, Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys appointed a Skirvin Solutions Committee to evaluate whether or not the historic building could be saved. The committee started its work by touring other restored historic hotels, looking at how those projects were paid for, and then recommended in October 2000 that the City of Oklahoma City explore creating a public-private partnership to get the Skirvin re-opened. In May 2002, Oklahoma City acquired the building from its current owners for $2.875 million and issued a request for proposals from potential developers late that same year. Partners in Development, a firm put together by principal John Weeman, made a proposal to renovate the building for $42.1 million and to re-open it as a full-service Hilton operated by Marcus Hotels and Resorts. The Oklahoma City Urban Renewal Authority selected Partners in Development as the developer in January 2004. Weeman bought the building from Oklahoma City in 2005, and, using money he invested plus funds from various other public sources including tax increment financing, grants, Empowerment Zone credits, historic tax credits and New Markets tax credits, completed its renovation for about $51 million.Skirvin, Money & Lackmeyer, p. 121‚Äì139, Haunting Rumors of a haunting in the hotel persist, and have been cited by National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. The most notable examples occurred in 2010, when the New York Knicks famously blamed their loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on the haunting and when the Chicago Bulls reported doors slamming shut on their own and strange sounds outside their rooms.\\"New York Knicks blame loss on 'haunted' hotel\\". Yahoo7 Sport. Retrieved January 13, 2010 The story received national attention again in June 2012, when the Miami Heat were staying in the hotel for the NBA Finals. Most recently, the Baylor Lady Bears, who were the defending National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Women's Division I basketball champions, were put up at the Skirvin. In one of the biggest upsets in tournament history, the Lady Bears unexpectedly lost, 81-82, to Louisville in the regional semifinals of the 2013 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament. As the story goes, the hotel's original owner, W. B. Skirvin, had an affair with a maid named \\"Effie\\", which led to a pregnancy. To protect his reputation and avoid a scandal, Skirvin locked the maid on the 10th floor. The maid became depressed and even after the birth of her child, she was still not let out of her room. She eventually jumped out a window killing herself and the baby, without notice in newspapers. In some versions of the legend, this maid is described as \\"a woman of loose morals\\", and men who have stayed in the hotel have reported being propositioned by a female voice while alone in their rooms.Andrew Knittle, \\"10 Unusual Places in Oklahoma\\", The Oklahoman, October 31, 2008.\\"Oklahoma Legends: Haunted Skirvin Hotel in Oklahoma City\\", Legends of America (accessed June 14, 2012). Others claim to have seen the figure of a naked woman with them while taking a shower. One man claimed he was sexually assaulted by an invisible entity during his stay. Over the years, hotel staff say they have seen objects moving by themselves and have heard strange noises at night.Skirvin Hotel Haunted Hotel Oklahoma City Scary Website According to Steve Lackmeyer (who also co-wrote a book about the hotel) and Jason Kersey (both reporters from The Oklahoman), Skirvin was \\"a notorious womanizer and drinker\\" and the 10th floor was known for various incidents of gambling and other vices, but there is no real-life evidence corresponding to the \\"Effie\\" story: Skirvin's family did believe that he had an employee (his assistant and bookkeeper, Mabel Luty) who was also his mistress, but she outlived him.

He cuts, paints, and assembles the glass - adding found glass objects along the way ‚Äì to create three-dimensional sculptures. Many of these works are large in scale. Statom is known for his site-specific installations in which his glass structures dwarf the visitor. Sound and projected digital imagery are also features of the environmental works. Early life and education The son of a physician, Therman Statom was born in Winter Haven, Florida in 1953 and raised in Washington, DC. There he developed a friendship with Cady Noland, the daughter of abstract painter Kenneth Noland. In childhood Statom is reported to have told the elder Noland (who was working on his target series at the time), ‚ÄúI can paint like that too.‚ÄùChrysler Museum of Art website, ‚ÄúArt of Glass About the Artists: Therman Statom,‚Äù Accessed 8/31/2005 Statom attributes his early desire to be an artist to Kenneth Noland. He began his study of glass as an art medium at Pilchuck Glass School in Stanwood, Washington in 1971, going on to study sculpture at Rhode Island School of Design. He received the Bachelor of Arts from that institution in 1974 and the Master of Arts from Pratt Institute School of Art and Design in 1978.Therman Statom resume found at Accessed 9/25/09 At Pratt he made his first works with sheet glass (which, in the glass industry, is called float glass) because the school was not equipped for hot glass working.

After the publications of Hierarchia Catholica by Konrad Eubel (1st edition in 1898) and of the dissertation of Brixius (1910, printed in 1912), it is generally accepted that for 12th and 13th centuries the cardinals listed in the older literature (e.g. A.

A freeboard is a specialist skateboard designed to closely simulate the behaviour of a snowboard. Freeboards were developed to allow snowboarders to transition to skateboarding (as non-winter transport) without the need to adapt to a smaller deck and narrower wheel-base. History Steen Strand conceived the idea for a freeboard as part of his master's thesis in product design at Stanford University, which he expanded into the freeboard style skateboard in 1996. After releasing an Alpha series featuring kicktails and longer decks (100‚Äì112cm) than his more recent versions,Freebord: About Strand began retailing his freeboards under the brand name Freebord in the late 1990s. By the mid-2000s other freeboard styles and brands had emerged and were developing strong retail track-records in mainstream sporting goods stores.Snowboard's new terrain: Asphalt; Pivoting 'oddity' gains momentum by Marco R. della Cava (USA TODAY, 10 March 2004)  Freebord brand  After developing the freeboard in 1996, Strand released two models under the Freebord brand in 1998; the FB-112 and the FB-110.S.F. entrepreneur has created a skateboard that works like a snowboard by Vanessa Hua (San Francisco Chronicle, 13 October 1999) The company patented designs relating to the Freebord brand freeboards. Though other companies have since developed their own freeboards and marketed them under alternate brand names, Freebord remains one of the largest producers of freeboards in the world. By 2000, the company had sold 4000 boards.Wheeler-Dealer by Kelly Barron (Forbes, 1 May 2000) In 2005, the company signed deals to have their product distributed to snowboarding enthusiasts in EuropeThe New Instant Companies by Michael V. Copeland (CNNMoney.com, 1 June 2005) The company continues to produce and market freeboards under the Freebord trademark. Features and technique A freeboard typically has 6 wheels: four normal longboard-style wheels at each corner and two spring-locked center wheels. The wheels on the central axis are able to turn freely in all directions, allowing the board to \\"slide\\" laterally provided none of the four corner wheels are touching the ground. This mimics the traditional \\"side-to-side\\" motion of snowboard riding. By exerting pressure on the corner wheels, the rider is able to control the board.Who Needs Snow? by Anita Hamilton (Time Magazine, 4 March 2002) Decks are usually constructed with seven-ply cross-laminated Canadian maple, although now there are Bamboo models available as well. Modern decks vary in size, but most are 7.5 to 9 inches wide and between 29 and 36 inches long. Snowboard-style bindings are used to provide more control over the board and allow the rider to exert more pressure on the corner wheels and edges. As on a snowboard, the rider is able to perform both carve and slide turns (skidded turns). \\"Freeride\\" and \\"freestyle\\" both refer to the way in which a freeboard is used. The term \\"freeride\\" refers to plain riding with little or no tricks, usually consisting of carving and sliding. Another name for freeride can be \\"Downhill\\". A bigger board is used for downhill freeboarding or freeriding as this gives you better balance allowing you to go faster. The term \\"freestyle\\" as used in other boardsports such as skateboarding means doing tricks like skating off ramps, grinding rails, jumping, etc. Smaller boards are usually used for freestyle as not only will they be lighter making them easier to jump with, but the rider can more easily push his feet outwards so as to make sure that his feet stay in the bindings.

Life He was born at Fronfraith in the parish of Llandyssil in Montgomeryshire, the third son of Richard Morgan, gent., M.P. for Montgomery Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency) in 1592-3, and of his wife, Margaret, daughter of Thomas Lloyd of Gwernbuarth. He was educated near Bronfraith, under the father of Simon Lloyd, archdeacon of Merioneth, and proceeded to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he entered 6 July 1624, and graduated B.A. in 1628, M.A. in 1631. He was appointed chaplain to David Dolben on his election to the bishopric of Bangor, and was nominated to the vicarage of Llanwnol in Montgomeryshire, 16 September 1632, and afterwards to the rectory of Llangynhafal and Dyffryn Clwyd. On Dolben's death in 1633 he returned to Cambridge, where on 25 June 1634 he was transferred to St. John's College. With the appointment of William Roberts to the bishopric of Bangor in 1637, he returned to Wales as his chaplain, and received from him the vicarage of Llanfair in the deanery of Dyffryn Clwyd, 1637, and the rectory of Efenechtyd in 1638. He proceeded B.D. that year. On 1 July 1642 he was collated prebendary of Chester on the resignation of David Lloyd, but he does not appear to have retained it in the civil war. Having resigned Llangynhafal, he was instituted to Trefdraeth in Anglesey on 16 July 1642. In the same year he resigned Llanfair, and was inducted to Llandyvnan (19 November 1642), also in Anglesey. At his own expense he bought from the Bulkeleys of Baron Hill, Anglesey the unexpired term of a ninety-nine years' lease of the tithes of Llandyvnan; his title to the living was not questioned during the wars, although he was ejected from his other preferments. By leaving this lease to the church he raised its annual value from ¬£38 to ¬£200. During the Commonwealth he resided chiefly at Henblas in the parish of Llangristiolus in Anglesey. In 1657, on the death of Robert White, he was nominated to the prebend of Penmynyd (Bangor diocese), but was not installed till after the Restoration, and relinquished it before April 1661. At the Restoration he recovered his living of Trefdraeth, received the degree of D.D. (1661), became archdeacon of Merioneth, 24 July 1660, and in the same month 'comportioner' of Llandinam. On the death of Dr. Robert Price he was elected bishop of Bangor (8 June 1666), and consecrated 1 July at Lambeth. He held the archdeaconry of Merioneth in commendam from July 1660 to 1666, when (23 Oct.) he was succeeded by John Lloyd. The definite union of the archdeaconry with the bishopric was accomplished by Morgan's successor. He was long engaged in litigation with Thomas Jones, who held the living of Llandyrnog, which had usually been held by the bishops of Bangor in commendam because of its convenience for residence. Jones brought a charge against the bishop and two others early in 1669 in the court of arches. Morgan died 1 September 1673, and was buried on 6 September in the grave of Bishop Nicholas Robinson, on the south side of the altar. (for two different inscriptions see Lansdowne MS. 986, fol. 168). He had made restorations in Bangor Cathedral, and gave an organ; he was a preacher in English and Welsh. Family Morgan married Anne, daughter and heiress of William Lloyd, rector of Llaneilian, Anglesey, and left four sons: (1) Richard, died young; (2) Owen, of Jesus College and Gray's Inn (1676), and attendant on Sir Leoline Jenkins at the treaty of Nimeguen, died 11 April 1679; (3) William (b. 1664), LL.B. of Jesus College, Oxford (1685), later chancellor of the diocese of Bangor; (4) Robert D.D. (b. 1665), of Christ Church, Oxford, canon of Hereford 1702, and rector of Ross, Herefordshire. Of four daughters: (1) Margaret was wife of Edward Wynne; (2) Anna, wife of Thomas Lloyd of Kefn, registrar of St. Asaph; (3) Elizabetha, married Humphrey Humphreys, dean of Bangor; and (4) Katherine, who died unmarried, was buried with her father.

Through play children can develop social and cognitive skills, mature emotionally, and gain the self-confidence required to engage in new experiences and environments.Human growth and the development of personality, Jack Kahn, S usan Elinor Wright, Pergamon Press, Key ways that young children learn include playing, being with other people, being active, exploring and new experiences, talking to themselves, communication with others, meeting physical and mental challenges, being shown how to do new things, practicing and repeating skills and having fun.Learning, playing and interacting. Good practice in early years foundation stages . Page 9  Definitions of work and play  According to proponents of the concept, play enables children to make sense of their world. Children possess a natural curiosity to explore and play acts as a medium to do so. In the book Einstein Never Used Flash Cards, five elements of children's play are listed:Einstein Never Used Flash Cards, Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, Roberta Michnick Golinkoff, Rodale Inc., *Play must be pleasurable and enjoyable. *Play must have no extrinsic goals; there is no prescribed learning that must occur. *Play is spontaneous and voluntary. *Play involves active engagement on the part of the player. *Play involves an element of make-believe. Definitions of play *Creativity Role play and pretend play involves creativity, such as: making props to use or finding objects to be used as props. Play can also be creative when the player constructs building blocks, uses paint or uses different materials to build an object. Creativity is not about the end product, but the process of the play scenario. *Imagination Imagination is used during play when the person involved creates images in their minds to do with their feelings, thoughts and ideas. The person then uses these images in their play.Bruce, T. (2011). Learning Through Play: For Babies, Toddlers and Young Children (2nd ed). London: Hodder Education. Seven common characteristics of play are listed in Playing and Learning, by Beverlie Dietze and Diane Kashin: Play is active, child- initiated, process oriented, intrinsic, episodic, rule-governed, and symbolic.Playing and Learning, Beverlie Dietze, Diane Kashin, page 46,Pearson Prentice Hall, Work There are critical differences between play and work. Play is mostly a self-chosen activity by the child, rather than prescribed by a parent or teacher; it is a process, rather than a predicted outcome or product. Work, on the other hand, has a definite intent and a prescribed outcome.Wiltz & Fein, 2006 as cited in Playing and Learning, Beverlie Dietze, Diane Kashin,2011, page 3,Pearson Prentice Hall, According to Dietze and Kashin: > In order for an activity to be considered play, the experience must include > a measure of inner control, ability to bend or invent reality, and a strong > internally based motivation for playing. If parents and educators try to > label experiences as play, but in reality have specific requirements for the > activity, then it becomes work not play. For example, it is really > impossible to play with flash cards whose purpose is to have a child > memorize something on each card. This is not playing and children quickly > differentiate between pure play and work being disguised as play.Bergen, > 2009 as cited in Playing and Learning, Beverlie Dietze, Diane Kashin,2011, > page 5,Pearson Prentice Hall, Play is not wasted time, but rather time spent building new knowledge from previous experience.Isenberg and Quisenberry,2002 as sited in Thinking It Through: Teaching and Learingng in the Kindergarten Classroom Playing is Learning, page 12, Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario, 2010 However, long term developmental qualities of play are difficult to research. There are various ways in which researchers may choose to look at the differences between work and play. Researchers may choose definitions of play or work based on: # Primary Activities: Even if a culture considers a child's action is play, a researcher may choose to define the child's action as work because it does add ‚Äú immediate worth to the family unit.‚Äù # The Parent's Concept: Parents from different cultures define children's actions of work and play differently. For example, a Mayan mother whose daughter sets up her own fruit stand may consider this action as play. However, many westerners would consider this work if the child is actually successful at selling items from the fruit stand. A child in the United States who sets up a lemonade stand is considered to be working for money. # The Child's Concept: Children have different ideas of what play and work are in comparison to adults.  Classical, modern and contemporary perspectives  There are three main groups of play theories: #Classical theories focus on play from the aspects of burning off excess energy; recreation and relaxation; replenishing energy after hard work; practicing future roles, and recapitulation theory (passing through successive stages by ancestors). Herbert Spencer suggests that play is a mechanism that allows humans to expend excess energy not required for survival; this can be achieved by children through play. #Modern theories examine play from the perspective of how it impacts a child's development. According to Dietze and Kashin, ‚ÄúThe learner is no longer regarded as a passive receiver of knowledge, but as an active constructor of meaning‚Äù.Katzeff, 2003 as cited in Playing and Learning, Beverlie Dietze, Diane Kashin,2011, page 36,Pearson Prentice Hall, This perspective is emphasized within the constructionist theory through experiential learning. Theorist John Dewey suggests that children learn best by both physical and intellectual activity; in other words, children need to take an active role in play. #Contemporary theories focus on the relationship of play to diversity and social justice in daily living and knowledge. Children learn social and cultural contexts through their daily living experiences. The Zone of Proximal Development concept, developed by Lev Vygotsky, suggests that children require activities that support past learning and encourage new learning at a slightly-more-difficult level. Vygotsky believed that social engagement and collaboration with others are powerful forces which transform children's thinking. Urie Bronfenbrenner states that a child's development is influenced by both the person and the environment (which includes family, community, culture and the broader society). Vygotsky explained that early childhood is the period in which the lower mental functions become reconstructed for the first time in their lives into cultural tools used to transform their cognitive processes such as perception, attention, memory, and thinking (Khuluqo, 2016) . This is similary done in social-emotional transitions, allowing children to become ‚Äúmasters of their own behavior‚Äù instead of being ‚Äúslaves to their environment.‚Äù (Bodrova & Leong 2015) Cultural values of the Yucatec Maya The way that children learn through play is culturally specific \\"as result of differences in childrearing beliefs, values, and practices.\\" Play both influences and reflects the way children from different cultures learn. Most western cultures would agree with the previously described definition of play where play is enjoyable, have no extrinsic goals, no prescribed learning that must occur, is spontaneous and voluntary, involves active engagement on the part of the player, involves an element of make- believe. However, that is not so for most others. For example, the Yucatec Maya do not have emotional aspects in make-believe play, and most of their play is reality based. Yucatec Maya commonly learn through \\"Intent Community Participation,\\" an approach different from that commonly found among middle class European American families. This approach stresses observation that intertwines individuals in community action. Unlike children from the U.S., Yucatec Maya children seldom engage in pretend play. Pretend play is considered a form of lying because children are not representing something that actually happens. For example, a Mayan mother told an ethnographer that she would \\"tolerate\\" her child pretending that the leaves in the bowl was a form of food. Instead of having imaginary circumstances and friends, they play through various real life situations that reflect everyday life of the Yucatec. For example, children go through the steps of making tortillas, weaving, and cleaning clothing. This relates to not having Age Segregation. Unlike children of the industrialized middle-class who play mainly with children of the same age, The Yucatec Mayan children engage with all ages, exploring activities of daily life. Different cultures and communities encourage children to play in different ways. For instance, some cultures may prevent parents from joining in play, prohibit children from receiving toys, or may expect children to play in mixed age groups away from adults. They may be expected to grow out of play by 5 or in middle childhood.Bruce, T. (2001). Helping Young Children Through Play: Babies, Toddlers and the Foundation Years. London: Hodder Education Different age groups have different cognitive capabilities. For example, when older Yucatec children pretend to discipline (modeling parental structures and exploring emotions), children who are younger may react negatively because they do not understand that the discipline is a game. Their culture also emphasizes learning through observation. Children are active participators by observing and modeling activities that are useful to the community. \\" It is inherently integrated into the daily activities of the compound.\\" Their repeated realistic representations of the adult world are represented through their play. In the first half of the twentieth century, Susan Isaacs introduced the study of play. This came from the understanding of child development that came from Western Europe and the USA. However, experts such as Gunilla Dahlberg et al. (1999) suggest that Western ways of looking at play cannot be applied cross culturally. Fleer's (1995) work with Australian aboriginal children challenges Western experts as to whether it is ideal to encourage play. She suggests that, \\"the children she studied did not play, and that it is not necessary for them to do so\\".Bruce, T (2001) Learning through play:Babies, Toddlers and the Foundation Years. London: Hodder Education. p7.  Importance  Play is sufficiently important to the United Nations that it has recognized it as a specific right for all children.‚ÄúFact Sheet: A Summary of the Rights Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child‚Äù, Article 31, http://www.unicef.org/crc/files/Rights_overview.pdf, accessed February 11, 2010 Children need the freedom to explore and play. Play also contributes to brain development. Play enables developmental in the prefrontal cortex of mammals, including humans. Evidence from neuroscience shows that the early years of a child's development (from birth to age six) set the basis for learning, behavior and health throughout life. A child's neural pathways are influenced in their development through the exploration, thinking, problem- solving and language expression which occur during play episodes.Playing and Learning, Beverlie Dietze, Diane Kashin,2011,Pearson Prentice Hall, According to the Canadian Council on Learning, \\"Play nourishes every aspect of children‚Äôs development ‚Äì it forms the foundation of intellectual, social, physical, and emotional skills necessary for success in school and in life. Play 'paves the way for learning'‚Äù.Canadian Council on Learning (Early Childhood Learning Knowledge Centre), ‚ÄúLet the Children Play: Nature‚Äôs Answer to Early Learning‚Äù, Lessons in Learning (Ottawa: CCL, 2006), p. 2 Learning occurs when children play with blocks, paint a picture or play make-believe. During play children try new things, solve problems, invent, create, test ideas and explore. Children need unstructured, creative playtime; in other words, children need time to learn through their play. The level of emotional arousal enacted during play is ideal for consolidation and integration of neural pathways. Allowing the child to direct the play means allowing the child to find the place most comfortable, allowing the promotion of neuroplasticity. Within the playroom where there are endless opportunities for children to engage in self-directed play and create their own schemas allowing the integration of affect and cognition. Play also promotes neuroplasticity development by allowing children to co-construct wordless narratives of self- awareness and transformation. (Stewart, Field, Echterling, 2016) According to Pascel, \\"Play is serious business for the development of young learners. This is such an important understanding. A deliberate and effective play-based approach supports young children‚Äôs cognitive development. When well designed, such an approach taps into children‚Äôs individual interests, draws out their emerging capacities, and responds to their sense of inquiry and exploration of the world around them. It generates highly motivated children enjoying an environment where the learning outcomes of a curriculum are more likely to be achieved‚Äù.  In childhood  Children in alt=Young boy and girl filling a pail in a sandbox It has been acknowledged that there is a strong link between play and learning for young children, especially in the areas of problem solving, language acquisition, literacy, numeracy and social, physical, and emotional skills. Young children actively explore their environment and the world around them through learning-based play. Play is a vital part of a child's optimal social, cognitive, physical and emotional development.Playing and Learning, Beverlie Dietze, Diane Kashin,2011,Pearson Prentice Hall, Researchers agree that play provides a strong foundation for intellectual growth, creativity, problem-solving and basic academic knowledge.Fisher, K., Hirsh-Pasek, K., Golinkoff, R.M., Berk, L., & Singer, D. (2010). Playing around in school: Implications for learning and educational policy. In A. Pellegrini (Ed), Handbook of the Development of Play (pp. 341-362). New York, NY: Oxford Press.Fisher, K. & Hirsh-Pasek, K. (2012). Fostering mathematical thinking through playful learning. In S. Saggate & E. Reese (Eds.), Contemporary Debates on Child Development and Education. According to Dorothy Singer, ‚ÄúThrough make-believe games children can be anyone they wish and go anywhere they want. When they engage in sociodramatic play, they learn how to cope with feelings, how to bring the large, confusing world into a small, manageable size; and how to become socially adept as they share, take turns and cooperate with each other. When children play, they are learning new words, how to problem solve, and how to be flexible‚Äù.Dorothy Singer, as cited in Einstein Never Used Flash Cards, Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, Roberta Michnick Golinkoff, page 213 Rodale Inc. As children learn through purposeful, quality play experience, they build critical basic skills for cognitive development and academic achievement. These include verbalization, language comprehension, vocabulary, imagination, questioning, problem-solving, observation, empathy, co-operation skills and the perspectives of others.Thinking It Through: Teaching and Learingng in the Kindergarten Classroom Playing is Learning, page 28, Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario, 2010 Through play, children learn a set of skills: social skills, creativity, hand-eye coordination, problem solving and imagination. It is argued that these skills are better learned through play than through flashcards or academic drills. Additionally, Slovak researchers Gmitrova and Gmitrov have found evidence clarifying the importance of pretend play as a medium through which children can progress in areas beyond the educational curriculum.Gmitrova, V. and Gmitrov, G. The impact of teacher-directed and child-directed pretend play on cognitive competence in kindergarten children. Early Childhood Education Journal (2003) Vol. 30, No. 4, pp. 241-246 Social play will allow a child to grow confident when experimenting with new activities, and become successful at manipulating different symbol systems in a creative and more adept way. The benefits of play are so extensive that it has been deemed an evolutionary and developmentally important activity, allowing children the space to engage in socially appropriate interactions and behaviors that will serve them far into adulthood.  Beliefs about the play-learning relationship  According to Linda Longley and colleagues, experts and parents have different beliefs about the relationship between play activities and learning. While parents ascribe more learning value to structured play activities (e.g., educational videos), experts identify structured activities as \\"non-play\\" and associate less learning value with these activities compared to unstructured activities (make-believe, or pretend, play). Play in the classroom fosters improvements in skills needed to succeed in the transitions from preschool to kindergarten and every opportunity for play is an opportunity for growth in knowledge on subjects such as early literacy, socio-emotional skills, language, mathematics, and it does this for children from both low- and higher-income socioeconomic status. However, in spite of the recognized benefits of play in terms of academics, studies show a stead decrease in kindergartens classes allowance of play-based activities. As public school teachers face pressure to shift their classes towards more academically focused curriculum. (Lynch, 2015)  Play-based learning  Play develops children's content knowledge and provides children the opportunity to develop social skills, competences and disposition to learn.Wood, E. and J. Attfield. (2005). Play, learning and the early childhood curriculum. 2nd ed. London: Paul Chapman Play-based learning is based on a Vygotskian model of scaffolding where the teacher pays attention on specific elements of the play activity and provides encouragement and feedback on children's learning. When children engage in real-life and imaginary activities, play can be challenging in children's thinking. To extend the learning process, sensitive intervention can be provided with adult support when necessary during play-based learning. Play-based learning can also be defined as: > \\"‚Ä¶ children being active and involved in their learning. Children learn best > through first-hand experiences‚Ä¶ the purpose of play-active learning is that > it motivates, stimulates and supports children in their development of > skills, concepts, language acquisitions/communication skills and > concentration. It also provides opportunities for children to develop > positive attitudes and to demonstrate awareness/use of recent learning, > skills and competencies, and to consolidate learning.\\"Welsh Assembly > Government. 2008.

This guidance goes on to state: > \\"Practitioners cannot plan children's play, because this would work against > the choice and control that are central features of play. Practitioners can > and should plan for children's play, however, by creating high quality > learning environments, and ensuring uninterrupted periods for children to > develop their play\\" Moyles, J (2010) The Excellence of play 3rd > Edition.Berkshire:Open University Press.p4‚âà According to researchers Kathy Hirsh-Pasek and Roberta Michnick Golinkoff, ‚ÄúThe level of children‚Äôs play rises when adults play with them. The variety of play children engage in also increases when adults join in. The joining in is different from controlling. Controlling makes children follow their parents' agenda and does not lead to as much cognitive development as when parents follow their children's lead‚Äù. Play is the language and currency of children.Apple to Zebra. 2018. Play-based Learning: What is It and Why It Matters. Retrieved August 23rd, 2018, from: https://www.appletozebra.com/blogs/stories/play-based-learning There are several ways educators/parents/guardians can facilitate children's learning during play:Burton, R. (2011). It‚Äôs time to stop defending play. Exchange (01648527), May/June 2011, Issue 199, p. 68-71. #Adults can role-model positive attitudes towards play, encouraging it and providing a balance of indoor and outdoor play throughout the year. When adults join in they should guide shape, engage in and extend it, rather than dictating or dominating the play. #Orchestrate an environment by deciding what toys, materials, and equipment to be included in that environment. It is important to offer a variety of materials and experiences at varying levels of difficulty. The choice of materials is important, because it provides the motivation for children's exploration and discovery. Both indoor and outdoor experiences should provide exploratory centres and space. The play environment should allow children to make choices, and to explore play possibilities. The play environment should reflect the child's daily living experiences. #Observe carefully as children begin to use the toys, materials and equipment. Observation is an ongoing process, providing information about the child's interests, abilities and strengths and opportunities for further learning and development. Observation helps identify ways adults can build on and guide the learning. #Insinuate oneself carefully into the play activity #Listen, repeat, extend and ask questions at the right time #Extend children's natural observation by providing the language necessary to help children articulate what they see happening. Adults can promote play and opportunities for expansive discoveries; they can enhance (or facilitate) play by encouraging children to bring their interests and experiences into the play. The adults can ask questions, to expand and enhance play. #Help children recognize the concepts that emerge as they grapple with the environment, make hypotheses, recognize similarities and differences, and solve problems #Provide social knowledge while allowing children the opportunity to learn the physical and logico-mathematical knowledge that helps them understand the world around them  Criticism of play-based learning   Knowledge acquisition  Forty years of research has shown positive correlation between play and children's learning.Lillard, A. S., Lerner, M.D., Hopkins, E.J., Dore, R.A., Smith, E.D. & Palmquist, C.M. (2012). The Impact of Pretend Play on Children‚Äôs Development: A Review of the Evidence. Psychological Bulletin. Advance online publication. doi: 10.1037/a0029321 This has led many to conclude that play is beneficial for all learning. However, many such findings may be reflective of procedural knowledge rather than declarative knowledge.Pinkham, A. M., Kaefer, T. & Neuman, S. B. (2012). Knowledge Development in Early Childhood: Source of learning and classroom Implications. New York, NY: Guilford Press. It is not certain whether correlational research can prove or know what degree play is responsible for these advantages . The assumptions that children can learn declarative information, such as words or facts, simply based on evidence that children acquire skills in play can not be made. The true value of play is not that it can teach children facts, but that it can help them acquire important procedural knowledge, which is beneficial in acquiring declarative knowledge. In play based learning environments, the classroom is where there are endless opportunities for children to engage in self-directed play and create their own schemas allowing the integration of affect and cognition. Play also promotes neuroplasticity development by allowing children to co-constructing wordless narratives of self-awareness and transformation.  Pretend play: creativity, intelligence and problem solving  Regarding creativity, meta- analysis has shown unconvincing evidence of pretend play enhancing creativity. Correlation studies have been inconsistent, with some showing relationships only to social pretend play, pretend play, or constructional play, and other studies failing to show relationships to those same constructs. In terms of intelligence, the research has claimed it is not certain whether play promotes intelligence or intelligence promotes play and other adult interventions are no different in promoting intelligence in children. For problem solving, the form of construction play is correlated with solving problems that involve construction (puzzle toys). Further research should examine if such ‚Äúplay‚Äù helps problem solving generally. Pretend play, also known as \\"make-believe play\\" involves acting out ideas and emotions. Children act out stories that contain different perspectives and ideas. Although some studies show that this type of play does not enhance child development, others have found that it has a large impact on children's language usage and awareness of the perspectives of others. Pretend play can also help with a child's self-regulation in the areas of civility, delayed gratification, empathy, and reduced aggression. It can also improve social skills such as empathy, problem solving, and communication.Kaufman, Scott B., Dr., Jerome L. Singer, Dr., and Dorothy G.

Play based learning experiences also provide caregivers an opportunity to assess behavioral output and intervene if a child is showing signs of developmental delay or trauma and are able to then recommend services based on those observations made during play.  Play-based learning programs  Play-based learning programs include: *High/Scope is an example of a cognitive approach. The philosophy is that children should be involved actively in their own learning. High/Scope provides 58 Key experiences. In learning center time, they use a plan, do, review approach. This approach allows them to transcend the egocentric now while taking responsibility for directing their own learning. Adults working with the children see themselves more as involved facilitators of play rather than managing the play itself. *Creative Curriculum is an early childhood teaching approach that focuses on social/emotions development and focuses on project-based investigations as a way for children to apply skills and addresses the four areas on development: social/emotional, physical, cognitive, and language. Centered around following 11 interest areas: blocks, dramatic play, toys and games, art, library, discovery, sand and water, music and movement, cooking, computers, and the outdoors as reported by the what works clearinghouse and the US department of education. *The Montessori Method emphasizes self-directed activity on the part of the child and clinical observation on the part of the teacher. The objective is to adapt the child's learning environment to his or her development level. This broad approach encourages children to learn through play. *Ontario Full Day Early Learning Kindergarten Program, for 4- and 5-year-olds, is a school program consisting of exploration, investigation, guided and explicit instruction. *Ontario Early Years Centres is a parent-child interactive program with a focus on play-based learning. Parents and caregivers stay with the child, and can obtain information about programs and services available for young children and their families. *The Reggio Emilia approach, which is based upon the project approach, has a vision of the child as a competent learner, and has produced a child-directed curriculum model. The curriculum has purposeful progression, and is based on emergent curriculum, but no defined teacher-directed sequence. Teachers follow the children's interests, and provide focused instruction in reading and writing within the parameters of the project that the children select. The Reggio approach believes that children learn through interaction with others (including parents, staff and peers) in a friendly learning environment. *Project Approach for preschoolers involves children in studies of things nearby that are interests them are worth knowing more about, is more teacher instructed, but based on the children's interest and works to introduce new vocabulary and allow informal conversation opportunity (Dfuss, 2019) See also * Educational entertainment References Bodrova, E., & Leong, D.

Their performance of \\"I've Got a Funny Feeling for Ophelia\\" on the summer TV series Dean Martin Presents, starring The Golddiggers, Joey Heatherton, and Frank Sinatra, Jr., is part of the collection of the Museum of TV & Radio in New York and The Paley Center in Beverly Hills. The beginning In early 1964, Michel Choquette, a singer- guitarist-performer from Canada, found himself stranded in Vancouver, when the owner of the coffeehouse he was to play there went bust. Among the other performers in town was Peter Elbling, a 20-year-old British folk singer who Choquette had met in Calgary several months previously. Their mutual interest in 1920s music and vaudeville and music-hall led to the creation of a comic musical act called The Times Square Two. Elbling became \\"Mycroft Partner\\" and Choquette \\"Andrew i.\\" (This allowed them, if asked their names, to reply, \\"My Partner and i.\\" \\"Mycroft\\" sported a goatee, claimed to have been born of a Malayan princess on a rubber plantation and radiated a dominant, pompous Oliver Hardy persona. \\"Andrew,\\" who affected slicked-flat hair, large rimless glasses and a nasal, high-pitched voice (in which he asserted he had once hoped to play football for Notre Dame), became his flightier, subservient Stan Laurel. (They told interviewers they had met while sitting out an avalanche in an Alpine hut with a goatherd and some lusty peasant girls.) They created an imaginary world of entertainment that hovered between 1880 and 1930. They came to inhabit this world in dress, conversation and manner so completely whether on stage or off, that they acquired a liveried chauffeur, who drove them about in a 1930 Model A. Their act opened with both men dressed in 1920s blue pinstriped suits sitting on straight-back chairs, staring fixedly ahead while holding guitars parallel to the ground. They would begin a song like \\"Just a Gigolo\\" or \\"I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate,\\" rise like syncopated toys, and kick like demented Rockettes. They would juggle fruit, read minds, perform acrobatics, hypnosis, a botched escape bit and achieve climax by dancing together while playing \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" on opposite ends of the same guitar, never losing the beat or missing a note. After perfecting their act in Vancouver, they journeyed to Los Angeles and San Francisco, where they performed at The Committee Theater and then shared the bill at the hungry i with Woody Allen, Noel Harrison, and Dick Cavett. In 1966, a Newsweek reporter caught the show at Chicago's Mother Blues. His story ran the same week they made their debut on national television on The Merv Griffin Show. A surge in bookings followed. For the next three years they performed in coffee houses, nightclubs, and concert halls appearing with such luminaries as Sarah Vaughan, Paul Butterfield, James Cotton, Stan Getz, The Chambers Brothers, Morgana King, and Jos√© Feliciano. They appeared on numerous TV shows including those of Steve Allen, Johnny Carson, Mike Douglas, David Frost, Dean Martin, the Kraft Music Hall and the Smothers Brothers. They had a three-week run off- Broadway and toured the United Kingdom with Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention. The Times Square Two usually appeared as a specialty act on television and initially did not speak to the audience, assuming a deadpan delivery and launching into deliberately dated songs like \\"Okay, Toots!\\" and \\"Hello, Hawaii, How Are You?\\" In later appearances, \\"Mycroft\\" would introduce each song in florid speech, while making dismissive remarks about the stoic \\"Andrew\\" (\\"I am Mycroft Partner, and this... is who he has always been\\"). In this respect their stage personalities were very much like the British musical-revue team of Flanders and Swann, with \\"Mycroft\\" dominating the dialogue as Michael Flanders did, and accompanist \\"Andrew\\" suffering in silence like the bespectacled Donald Swann did. The end Peter Elbling describes the end of their association thus: > \\"I quit the Times Square Two because we weren't coming up with new material > and hadn't in a long time. Without realizing it, we had boxed ourselves into > a corner by confining ourselves to material from the first two decades of > the 1900s.\\" Life after T.S.T. Choquette went on to work for The National Lampoon and on editing a vast and ambitious comic book project with material from numerous internationally-known cartoonists and media figures. The book was entitled \\"Someday Funnies\\" and was completed and published through Abrams ComicArts in 2011. Choquette teaches screen-writing and comedy writing at McGill University and Concordia University in Montreal. Elbling was later a member of The Committee, acted on many televisions shows (including Taxi and WKRP) and films (including Phantom of the Paradise) during the 1970s and 80s, created the 1979 satirical NY Times Best Seller The 80s: A Look Back at the Tumultuous Decade 1980‚Äì1989, has written children's books as well as the international best selling novel The Food Taster. He is now creating films for Harold A. Vinegar.

Based on a novel by J√≥zef Hen, the film achieved cult status in the history of Polish cinema. The film is set in 1945, immediately after the end of World War II. It tells a story of Andrzej Kenig (portrayed by Gustaw Holoubek), a former fighter of the Polish resistance and survivor of a German concentration camp. He is sent with a small group of men as government representatives to a small fictional town of Siwowo/Graustadt in the so-called Recovered Territories, the new Western Territories of Poland. Their task is to secure the property left there by the retreating Germans. The small town is mostly abandoned and the only remaining inhabitants are four women and a drunken waiter in the hotel. Upon reaching the town, Kenig discovers that the other members of the government delegation are not who they claim to be and that their only task is to loot as much of the property as they can for themselves. Kenig decides to fight against the gang of bandits alone. There is a shootout on the roofs and in the streets of the deserted town. The motive of a lone hero fighting against a group of villains resulted in the film being often described as a \\"Polish western\\". The film is also well-remembered because of the original score written by Krzysztof Komeda, and especially the highly-popular title song Nim wstanie dzie≈Ñ (Before the day breaks) with music by Komeda, lyrics written by Agnieszka Osiecka and performed by Edmund Fetting.

Her grandfather was the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales. Marriages and children She married three times: *Firstly, when aged 11, she married Sir John Phelip (c. 1380 ‚Äì 2 October 1415).Archer, Rowena E. \\"Chaucer [married names Phelip, Montagu, de la Pole, Alice, duchess of Suffolk\\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 19 May 2011.

Sir John, also titled Lord Donnington, had married Maud, the widow of Walter Cookesey of Caldwall Castle, Kidderminster in the County of Worcestershire. Sir John lived at Caldwall Castle during his marriage to Maud and upon her death married Alice Chaucer. Sir John, a close personal friend of Henry V, died of dysentery after the successful 22 September 1415 capture of the fortress of Harfleur in Normandy. Sir John is buried at St Mary's Church in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. *Secondly, after 1421, Alice married Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury (1388‚Äì1428),Curry, Anne. \\"Montagu, Thomas [Thomas de Montacute, fourth earl of Salisbury\\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 03 January 2008. Accessed 5 February 2019. one of the most important English commanders during the Hundred Years' War, who died at the Siege of Orl√©ans. *Thirdly, in 1430, she married William de la Pole (1396‚Äì1450), whose father Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk had also died at Harfleur along with Sir John Phelip. William was Steward of the Household to King Henry VI, and from 1447 to 1450 was the dominant force in the Council and Chief Minister to the king; as such he was particularly associated with the unpopular royal policies whose failures culminated in the anti-court protest and political violence of Cade's Revolt in 1450. He was Constable of Wallingford Castle in 1434. By William de la Pole she had a son: **John de la Pole (1442‚Äì1492) who married Elizabeth of York, making him the brother-in-law of two kings, Edward IV and Richard III. John became 2nd Duke of Suffolk in 1463. Career Alice was a lady-in-waiting to Margaret of Anjou in 1445, and a patron of the arts. Patron of art She ordered the making of a series of tapestries depicting the life of St Anne, which were displayed in the room in her house at Ewelme where she greeted visitors. She outlived her husband for a number of years and dwelled at Ewelme as the mistress of the house for a decade (during which times the tapestries were commissioned). She is a rare and important example of an autonomous woman patronising art works depicting empowered historical female characters. St Anne, mother of Virgin Mary and grandmother of Jesus, was a saint who was enjoying increasing popularity amongst female worshippers and was of particular pertinence to Alice as Anne, like Alice, also had had three marriages and was pregnant later in her life. Images of St Anne teaching the Virgin Mary to read were a popular image of Anne at this time, implying perhaps a contemporary reverence for literacy and education for women, though Alice is frequently overlooked as an historical figure of significance because of patriarchal assumptions about the subservience of women in history. Alice was a woman of intelligence and her life reveals information about the late medieval experience of women. She possessed a large library. Widowhood Alice could be both ruthless and acquisitive in pursuit of the inheritance of her son, John de la Pole. In 1437, the Duke constructed the God's House at Ewelme, a reminder of their Catholic devotions. But after her husband's execution she took back many of the Norfolk manors of her friend Margaret Paston, with dubious title deeds. The Paston family grew to loathe this Yorkist family, notorious for their corruption. In 1450, William de la Pole was impeached by the House of Commons in Parliament, but Henry VI intervened to exile his favourite rather than have him tried by the House of Lords. On his way across the English Channel his vessel was intercepted by The Nicholas of the Tower whose crew subjected him to a mock trial, after which he was beheaded and his body thrown overboard. William's remains were recovered from the beach at Dover, and Alice had her husband buried at the Kingston Charterhouse, founded in 1377 by his grandfather, Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk. After William was killed, his properties, including Wallingford Castle and the Honour of Wallingford and St Valery, passed to Alice. She lent the Crown 3,500 Marks whereupon the king spared the family from attainder of title. She survived many challenges to her position, including a state trial in 1451. Whilst she had benefited from Lancastrian connections, she switched to supporting the House of York during the Wars of the Roses. In 1455 she was custodian of the Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter at Wallingford Castle. She was officially castellan at Wallingford until at least 1471 and possibly until her death in 1475. In 1472 Alice became custodian of Margaret of Anjou, her former friend and patron. A wealthy landowner, Alice de la Pole held land in 22 counties, and was a patron of the poet John Lydgate. Death and burial Monument (north side) to Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk, St Mary's Church, Ewelme She died in 1475 and was buried in St Mary's Church, Ewelme, where survives her elaborate cadaver tomb monument. The alabaster monument, almost undamaged by time, consists of a chest tomb on top of which is the recumbent effigy of the Duchess, with a canopy of panelled stone above.

His credits include several singles for Garth Brooks (including Brooks' first number one hit, \\"If Tomorrow Never Comes\\"), as well as singles by Gary Morris, Diamond Rio, Patty Loveless and Chris Young. Blazy has a total of seven number one hits to his credit. Biography Kent Blazy was raised in Lexington, Kentucky. At an early age, he played rhythm guitar and sang in various local bands, citing The Byrds, Rodney Crowell and Joe Ely as influences. He later played for Canadian singer Ian Tyson. Later on, Blazy met former Exile member Mark Gray, who suggested that Blazy move to Nashville, Tennessee. Eventually, he signed to a publishing contract, but the publishing company closed; despite the loss of contract, Gary Morris sent Blazy's \\"Headed for a Heartache\\" into top 5 on the country charts. By the late 1980s, Blazy met with a then-unknown Garth Brooks, who gave him the idea for a song entitled \\"If Tomorrow Never Comes.\\" He and Brooks co-wrote the song, which went on to become Brooks' first number one hit. Brooks continued to record Blazy's material throughout the 1990s, including the singles \\"Ain't Goin' Down ('Til the Sun Comes Up),\\" \\"It's Midnight Cinderella\\", \\"She's Gonna Make It,\\" \\"Somewhere Other Than the Night\\" and the George Jones duet \\"Beer Run (B Double E Double Are You In?)\\". He also co-wrote \\"That's What I Get for Lovin' You\\" by Diamond Rio and \\"Can't Get Enough\\" by Patty Loveless in the late 1990s. Blazy, along with songwriters Pat Alger, Tony Arata and Kim Williams, recorded an album entitled A Songwriters' Tribute to Garth Brooks, which included their renditions of songs that they had written for Brooks. This album was released in 2001 via VFR Records.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has adopted a long term economic strategy that shifts its focus to develop a knowledge-based economy. King Saud University (KSU) is seeking to play a full part in this strategy through the development of a substantial science and technology park, ‚ÄúRiyadh Techno Valley - King Saud University (RTV-KSU)‚Äù, on its Riyadh campus. Through this project, KSU aims to satisfy the demands of the knowledge-based industries, and to commercialize its research outcomes, in addition to enhancing the research environment and encouraging researchers and graduates to participate in the incubation program and to establish spin-off knowledge- based companies.  Vision  To be a leading university technology park that promotes the culture of innovation and competence for its associated knowledge-based institutions and business partners.  Mission  Providing a stimulating and attractive environment for R&D;, which will contribute to achieving sustainability in development, as well as enhancing competitiveness of the national economy.  Objectives  ‚Ä¢ Transferring and developing technology to serve the national economy and achieve sustainable development. ‚Ä¢ Promoting the university‚Äôs cooperation with research and developing centers locally and internationally. ‚Ä¢ Creating a stimulating and attractive environment for local and global investment by establishing specialized firms in research and development. ‚Ä¢ Discovering, attracting and adopting innovators from within and outside the Kingdom. ‚Ä¢ Enhancing the utilization of knowledge and skills of all university students to achieve harmony between the output of education and the demands of industry. ‚Ä¢ Generating distinguished job opportunities in knowledge industry arenas.  History  On 19 October 1426 Hijri The Council of Ministers approved the 8th Development Plan of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which included the call for the \\"establishment of science parks at universities and research centers\\", and to direct \\"more attention to the promotion of co-financing and joint research programs between industry and public sector institutions, and the establishment of business incubators in order to transform research results into industrial and commercial applications.\\" Thus, on 20 November 1429 Hijri the King Saud University Council passed a resolution approving the creation of the Riyadh Techno Valley.  Value of King Saud University  Many factors distinguish King Saud University as a unique scientific and educational institution including: ‚Ä¢ Located uniquely in the capital of the Kingdom. ‚Ä¢ Having the King Abdullah Institute for Nanotechnology & Prince Sultan Institute for Advanced Technology on its premises, along with laboratories and research centers in America, China, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. ‚Ä¢ Ranking as number one in the Arab world for patents registered. ‚Ä¢ Enjoying infrastructure valued over 70 billion Saudi Riyal, ($ 18.7 billion). ‚Ä¢ Benefiting from a global network of alliances with top universities and research centers in more than 12 developed countries. ‚Ä¢ Signing service contracts with 14 Nobel Prize winners in various scientific specialties.  Main Research Areas of RTV  Three areas of research and technology have been proposed for the Valley as a result of feasibility studies based on the needs of the local and global market and the overall trend of the strategic plans of the Saudi Arabia, while keeping in mind the research areas that characterize the university. The feasibility studies were conducted by firms of international experience specialized in science parks. ‚Ä¢ Chemicals Technologies and Materials. ‚Ä¢ Biological, Agricultural, and Environmental technologies. ‚Ä¢ Information and Communications Technologies.  Chemical Technology and Materials  This research area has been selected for its importance of chemical and petroleum research and its subsidiary specialties for the Kingdom and because King Saud University is characterized by distinct possibilities for research in this field. The four sub-areas of research are: ‚Ä¢ Petrochemicals technologies ‚Ä¢ Chemicals technologies ‚Ä¢ Materials technologies ‚Ä¢ Renewable Energy  Biological, Agricultural, and Environmental Technologies  This unique area links the strategic needs of the Kingdom in the areas of health and food to the progress of research at the university in these technologies. It is compatible with the results of local and international industry market analysis, as well as the trends and mergers in the international biological, environmental and agricultural technologies sector. The three sub-areas of research are: ‚Ä¢ Pharmaceutical technologies. ‚Ä¢ Environmental technologies. ‚Ä¢ Food science and agricultural technologies.  Information and Communications Technologies (ICT)  This area of research and development has been selected in view of the remarkable expansion and competition in the market of information and communications technology in the Middle East with the growing demand for various telecommunications services and high speed internet, as evident in surveys conducted by King Abdullah Institute for Research and Consulting Studies. This area of research also supports other research areas in the Valley. The sub-areas of research include: * ICT * Information security * Electronic Services * Software Engineering  Support and Recreational Zones of RTV  Two zones dedicated to support services, housing, and recreation are also important parts of RTV. These are:  Scientific Village  The residential, recreational, and educational zone of the project.  Central Core  The pulsating heart of the science park, which contains the Incubation Center, the Center for Entrepreneurs, Technology Transfer Office, in addition to the Office of Support Services and Operations, and the laboratories to serve the local market, as well as governmental centers for research and development.

The initial report shows that the rate of HIV infection among volunteers who received the experimental vaccine was 31% lower than the rate of HIV infection in volunteers who received the placebo. However, the reduction was not great enough for the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand to support approving the vaccine; it was reported in 2019 that it would have licensed it if the reduction had been 50% or more. The trial collaborators have stated that results of this trial give the first supporting evidence of any vaccine being effective in lowering the risk of contracting HIV. On October 20, 2009, the organizers released full results of the study through publishing in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented them at the AIDS Vaccine Conference in Paris. Protocol A total of 16,402 Thai volunteers aged 18‚Äì30 were recruited to participate in Chon Buri and Rayong Provinces in Thailand. These volunteers were randomized into double-blind study groups, with those in the experimental group receiving a phase III prime-boost HIV vaccine. Eligibility criteria for participation in the study required that all volunteers be HIV negative prior to enrollment in the study and be willing to participate in educational counseling intended to teach ways to reduce risk behavior associated with contracting HIV. After being vaccinated, volunteers were asked to receive HIV testing every six months for three years, as well as receive additional risk-behavior counseling at every testing visit. Of note, before this vaccine trial was initiated, an opinion letter from 22 established HIV researchers was published in the journal Science calling into question the rationale for this study of combining two vaccines that each failed in prior human trials to generate immune responses that they were designed to elicit. This letter stated that spending $119 million when \\"the overall approval process lacked input from independent immunologists and virologists who could have judged whether the trial was scientifically meritorious\\" was an ill- advised use of precious resources. Results During the study, 125 of the 16,402 participants contracted HIV through behavior unrelated to their study participation. Of those 125, 74 infected persons had received placebo and 51 had received the vaccine, or 31.2% reduction. By one of the three pre-decided statistical tests for analysis of the trial there was a statistically significant lower rate of infection in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group, with p=0.04 for the \\"modified intent to treat\\" analysis that excluded persons who were found to have HIV infection after enrollment but before the first vaccination. However, by the other two methods of analysis, there was no statistical significance in infection rates between the vaccine and placebo groups, with p=0.08 for the \\"intent to treat analysis\\" including all persons originally enrolled in the trial, and p=0.16 for the \\"per protocol analysis\\" including only persons from the modified intent to treat group who completed all three vaccinations and subsequent screening Additionally, the vaccine regimen had no effect on the amount of virus in the blood of volunteers who became HIV-infected during the study. Immediately after release of the results, there was controversy and dispute over the significance of these results raised by several researchers, who also questioned the unusual strategy of pre-releasing the conclusion of vaccine efficacy to the press before publication of the actual data in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and lack of explanation regarding the three different statistical evaluations of which two did not yield significant results; Dr. Anthony Fauci defended this by stating that explaining these nuances in the press release \\"would have confused everybody\\". In May 2011, a new analysis initiated at Duke University showed that there is a 29% chance that the vaccine is not effective (although it must be noted that this posterior probability is very different conceptually from a p-value, and cannot be directly compared to the p=.04 from the original analysis). Cautious optimism In a study in September 2011, researchers involved with the trial at Mahidol University in Bangkok and the United States Military HIV Research Program in Washington DC tested the blood of trial subjects for different immune indicators between those who received the vaccine and contracted HIV (41 subjects) and those who did not become infected (205 subjects). Their work is not complete, but those in the study who produced IgG antibodies that recognise the V2 loop in the HIV envelope protein gp120 were 43% less likely to become infected. Those who produced envelope specific IgA were 54% more likely to become infected, but no more susceptible than trial subjects receiving the placebo. However, these studies all emphasize that such post-hoc analyses are subject to inherent bias and must be interpreted with caution. The immune responses of uninfected patients could point the way to more fruitful research. Nelson Michael, director of the U.S. Military HIV Research Program who ran the trial, says that results lend \\"biological credence to the initial clinical study results\\". Conclusion The vaccine was found to be safe, well tolerated, and suitable for large-scale further research. Vaccine composition Over six months, volunteers received a prime-boost vaccination including six injections, four injections of a vaccine called ALVAC HIV (vCP1521) with the last two being at the same time as two injections of another vaccine called AIDSVAX B/E (gp120). ALVAC‚ÄêHIV (vCP1521) consists of a viral vector containing genetically engineered versions of three HIV genes (env, gag and pol). The ALVAC vector is an inert form of canarypox, which is a bird virus which cannot cause disease or replicate in humans. AIDSVAX B/E is composed of genetically engineered gp120, a protein on the surface of HIV. Sponsors RV 144 is sponsored by the Surgeon General of the United States Army and conducted by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health with support from the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. Supported in part by an Interagency Agreement (Y1-AI-2642-12) between the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and by a cooperative agreement (W81XWH-07-2-0067) between the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine and the U.S. Department of Defense. Sanofi Pasteur provided the ALVAC-HIV vaccine, and Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases (VaxGen) provided the reagents for the immunogenicity assays. ALVAC‚ÄêHIV (vCP1521) was manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. AIDSVAX B/E was manufactured by Genentech under a license and supply agreement with VaxGen, which itself is a spin-off company of Genentech founded for the purpose of developing AIDSVAX. Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases, a nonprofit organization co‚Äêfounded by former VaxGen executives, has ownership of certain intellectual and manufacturing rights of AIDSVAX.

Author Neal Gabler focuses on the psychological motivations of these film moguls, arguing that their background as Jewish immigrants shaped their careers and influenced the movies they made. Themes Gabler's main thesis is that these producers (whom Gabler terms \\"Hollywood Jews\\") generally came from poor, fatherless backgrounds, and felt like outsiders in America because of their Jewishness. In Hollywood, these producers were able to run their own industry, assimilate into the American mainstream, and produce movies that fulfilled their vision of the American Dream. Gabler asserts that the nature of their business and their movies can often be traced back to their feelings of alienation as immigrants. The book also explains that the business background of the Hollywood Jews in theatre- ownership, retail distribution, and the garment industry shaped the approach these studio owners took to crafting movies for a popular audience, one similar to the marketing of films as commodities as well as works of art. The title of the book is a reference to F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel The Last Tycoon, in which Fitzgerald describes his protagonist, Monroe Stahr (a character inspired by the producer Irving Thalberg) as \\"coming home to an empire of his own‚Äîan empire he has made.\\"Charles Champlin, \\"The Founding Fathers of Hollywood\\", Los Angeles Times September 25, 1988.

Formed in 1993 by Janet Wygal (lead vocals, guitar), Tricia Wygal (lead vocals, bass), Delissa Santos (drums), Cindy Brolsma (cello), and Jennifer Richardson (violin), the band released one studio album, 1995's In the Grass, before disbanding in 2002. The band is best known for performing \\"You're Standing on My Neck\\", which was featured as the opening theme to the MTV animated series Daria. Splendora also performed \\"Turn the Sun Down\\" and \\"College Try\\" for the Daria television films Is It Fall Yet? and Is It College Yet?, respectively. History Formation and In the Grass: 1993‚Äì1996 After the break up of her power pop band The Wygals, Janet Wygal began recreationally composing music with her sister Tricia Wygal. By 1993, these music sessions expanded to include friends of the two sisters, namely Delissa Santos, Cindy Brolsma, and Jennifer Richardson. In an interview with Billboard, Tricia Wygal described the formation of the band to be a \\"labor of love\\", recalling that \\"[Splendora] rehearsed all the time. It was just fun\\". Splendora's debut studio album In the Grass was released on September 9, 1995 by Koch Records. Produced collaboratively between Splendora and Gene Holder, the title of the record is a spin on the 1961 teen melodrama Splendor in the Grass. In the Grass received little promotion and failed to achieve any considerable commercial success, with the album now being out of print and unavailable on music streaming services. Janet Wygal attributes the album's lukewarm commercial reception to a lack of support from Koch Records, explaining: \\"[Splendora] didn‚Äôt have a booking agent, the tour that we did, I booked, I think‚Ä¶ I remember going in there and calling radio stations myself, and asking if they‚Äôd received our CD\\". Daria theme songs and breakup: 1997‚Äì2002 In 1997, Cindy Brolsma acted as a producer of the then-upcoming adult animated sitcom Daria. Brolsma shared a copy of Splendora's debut studio album, In the Grass, with fellow Daria producer Susie Lewis, who ultimately chose Splendora to compose the theme song for the show. Splendora recorded a four-track demo for the show, building these songs around certain phrases that producers asked them to include in their lyrics. \\"You're Standing on My Neck\\" was chosen as the show's theme, with elements of the song also acting as incidental music in the show. The full song was also featured in the 2000 puzzle adventure video game Daria's Inferno. Splendora produced two further original themes for the Daria television movies Is It Fall Yet? and Is It College Yet?, being \\"Turn the Sun Down\\" and \\"College Try\\" respectively. Following the release of \\"College Try\\" in 2002, the band announced their decision to break up. With the exit of Delissa Santos and as other members began getting married and having children, there was a general lack of enthusiasm among band members. Tricia Wygal explained that these events had left the group feeling dissatisfied, stating, \\"It wasn‚Äôt quite the same band. It felt a little different\\". Post-breakup In 2013, lead vocalists Janet and Tricia Wygal briefly reunited for a performance of \\"You're Standing on My Neck\\" at the tavern and music venue Maxwell's. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of Daria, Andrew Unterberger of Billboard interviewed Janet and Tricia Wygal, in which they discussed Splendora's history and the group's three Daria theme songs. Musical style and influences Splendora drew inspiration from a variety of genres, including CBGB, sunshine pop, and grunge. Late-'60s and '70s bands such as Ramones, Television, Talking Heads, and The Free Design were formative influences on the band. Janet Wygal explained that the musical style of Splendora was meant to display \\"this aggressive-sounding bed, with pretty vocals floating over it\\".

Klemperer (October 6, 1927 ‚Äì November 5, 2017) was an American chemist who was one of the most influential chemical physicists and molecular spectroscopists in the second half of the 20th century. Klemperer is most widely known for introducing molecular beam methods into chemical physics research, greatly increasing the understanding of nonbonding interactions between atoms and molecules through development of the microwave spectroscopy of van der Waals molecules formed in supersonic expansions, pioneering astrochemistry, including developing the first gas phase chemical models of cold molecular clouds that predicted an abundance of the molecular HCO+ ion that was later confirmed by radio astronomy. Biography Bill Klemperer was born in New York City in 1927 and was raised there and in New Rochelle. His parents were both Physicians. He graduated from New Rochelle High school in 1944 and then enlisted in the U.S. Navy Air Corps, where he trained as a tail gunner. He obtained an A.B. from Harvard University in 1950, majoring in Chemistry, and then headed to the University of California, Berkeley, where in early 1954 he obtained a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry under the direction of George C. Pimentel. After one semester as instructor at Berkeley, Bill returned to Harvard in July 1954. Klemperer's initial appointment was an instructor of analytical chemistry, but he quickly rose through the ranks and was appointed full professor in 1965. He has remained associated with Harvard Chemistry throughout his long career. He spent 1968-69 on sabbatical with the Astronomers at Cambridge University and 1979-81 as Assistant Director for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the U.S. National Science Foundation. He was a visiting scientist at Bell Laboratories during a time when it was the premier industrial laboratory. Klemperer became an emeritus professor in 2002 but remained active in both research and teaching. Science Klemperer's early work concentrated on the infrared spectroscopy of small molecules that are only stable in the gas phase at high temperatures. Among these are the alkali halides, for many of which he obtained the first vibrational spectra. The work provided basic structural data for many oxides and fluorides, and gave remarkable insight into the details of the bonding. It also led Klemperer to recognize the immense potential of molecular beams in spectroscopy, and in particular the use of the electric resonance technique to address fundamental problems in structural chemistry. An important result was his benchmark measurement of the electric dipole moment of LiH,W. Klemperer (1955).\\"Infrared Spectrum of LiH\\", Journal of Chemical Physics 23, 2452. at a date when this was the largest molecule for which quantum chemical calculations had any hope of getting useful results in a sensible length of time. Klemperer has always been enthusiastic about molecular beams; he writes: \\"Molecular beams are fun for a chemist. They give one a sense of power.\\"W. Klemperer (1995). \\"Some Spectroscopic Reminiscences\\" , Annual Reviews in Physical Chemistry 46, 1 An example of this is the use that Klemperer and his students made of electric deflection methods to determine the polarities of a number of high temperature species; the results were unexpected, and to everyone's surprise it turned out that half the alkaline earth dihalides are polar,A. Buchler, J.L. Stauffer and W. Klemperer (1964). \\"The Determination of the Geometry of High Temperature Species by Electric Deflection and Mass Spectrometric Detection\\", Journal of the American Chemical Society 86, 4544. meaning they cannot be symmetric linear molecules, contrary to the simple and widely taught models of ionic bonding. Klemperer also provided precise dipole moments of excited electronic states both by using the Stark effect in electronic spectraD.E. Freeman and W. Klemperer (1964). \\"Dipole Moments of Excited Electronics States of Molecules: The 1A2 State of Formaldehyde\\", Journal of Chemical Physics 40 604 (1964). and by using electric resonance spectroscopy of metastable states of molecules.R.C. Stern, R.H. Gammon, M.E. Lesk, R.S. Freund and W. Klemperer (1970). \\"Fine Structure and Dipole Moment of Metastable a3Œ† Carbon Monoxide\\", Journal of Chemical Physics 52, 3467. Klemperer introduced the technique of supersonic cooling as a spectroscopic tool,S.E. Novick, P.B. Davies, T.R. Dyke and W. Klemperer (1973). \\"Polarity of van der Waals Molecules\\",Journal of the American Chemical Society 95 8547. which has dramatically increased the intensity of molecular beams and also greatly simplified the spectra. This innovation has been second only to the invention of the laser in its impact on high-resolution spectroscopy. Klemperer helped to found the field of interstellar chemistry. In interstellar space, densities and temperatures are extremely low, and all chemical reactions must be exothermic, with no activation barriers. The chemistry is driven by ion-molecule reactions, and Klemperer's modelingE. Herbst and W. Klemperer (1973). \\"The Formation and Depletion of Molecules in Dense Interstellar Clouds\\", The Astrophysical Journal 185, 505. of those that occur in molecular clouds has led to a remarkably detailed understanding of their rich highly non-equilibrium chemistry. Klemperer assigned HCO+ as the carrier of the mysterious but universal \\"X-ogen\\" radio-astronomical line at 89.6 GHz,W. Klemperer (1970). \\"Carrier of the Interstellar 89.190 GHz Line\\", Nature 227, 1230. which had been reported by D. Buhl and L.E. Snyder.D. Buhl and L.E. Snyder (1970). \\"Unidentified Interstellar Microwave Line\\", Nature 228, 267. Klemperer arrived at this prediction by taking the data seriously. The radio telescope data showed an isolated transition with no hyperfine splitting; thus there were no nuclei in the carrier of the signal with spin of one or greater nor was it a free radical with a magnetic moment. HCN is an extremely stable molecule and thus its isoelectronic analog, HCO+, whose structure and spectra could be well predicted by analogy, would also be stable, linear, and have a strong but sparse spectrum. Further, the chemical models he was developing predicted that HCO+ would be one of the most abundant molecular species. Laboratory spectra of HCO+ (taken later by Claude Woods et al.,R.C. Woods, T.A. Dixon, R.J. Saykally, and P.G. Szanto (1975). \\"Laboratory Microwave Spectrum of HCO+\\", Physical Review Letters 35, 1269.) proved him right and thereby demonstrated that Herbst and Klemperer's models provided a predictive framework for our understanding of interstellar chemistry. The greatest impact of Klemperer's work has been in the study of intermolecular forces, a field of fundamental importance for all of molecular- and nano-science. Before Klemperer introduced spectroscopy with supersonic beams, the spectra of weakly bound species were almost unknown, having been restricted to dimers of a few very light systems. Scattering measurements provided precise intermolecular potentials for atom‚Äìatom systems, but provided at best only limited information on the anisotropy of atom‚Äìmolecule potentials. He foresaw that he could synthesize dimers of almost any pair of molecules he could dilute in his beam and study their minimum energy structure in exquisite detail by rotational spectroscopy. This was later extended to other spectral regions by Klemperer and many others, and has qualitatively changed the questions that could be asked. Nowadays it is routine for microwave and infrared spectroscopists to follow his \\"two step synthesis\\" to obtain the spectrum of a weakly bound complex: \\"Buy the components and expand.\\" Klemperer quite literally changed the study of the intermolecular forces between molecules from a qualitative to a quantitative science. The dimer of hydrogen fluoride was the first hydrogen bonded complex to be studied by these new techniques,T.R. Dyke, B.J. Howard and W. Klemperer (1972). \\"Radio Frequency and Microwave Spectrum of the Hydrogen Fluoride Dimer: A Nonrigid Molecule\\", Journal of Chemical Physics 56, 2442. and it was a puzzle. Instead of the simple rigid-rotor spectrum, which would have produced a 1 ‚Äì 0 transition at 12 GHz, the lowest frequency transition was observed at 19 GHz. Arguing by analogy to the well known tunneling-inversion spectrum of ammonia, Klemperer recognized that the key to understanding the spectrum was to recognize that HF ‚Äì HF was undergoing quantum tunnelling to FH ‚Äì FH, interchanging the roles of proton donor and acceptor. Each rotational level was split into two tunneling states, with an energy separation equal to the tunneling rate divided by Planck's constant. The observed microwave transitions all involved a simultaneous change in rotational and tunneling energy. The tunneling frequency is extremely sensitive to the height and shape of the inter-conversion barrier, and thus samples the potential in the classically forbidden regions. Resolved tunneling splittings proved to be common in the spectra of weakly bound molecular dimers.

This includes all official main and side trails. The main line trails are marked using the solid light blue rectangular vertical paint blaze. A recent change in blaze design to official CFPA connector, side and alternate trails is now in use. The new design standard for blaze markings for these trails is the same light blue blaze as the main trails with the designated color square painted below and abutting to the blue blaze. The Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails are sometimes referred to by the acronym 'BBHTs'. The Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails and other trail systems listed in the Connecticut Walk Books by the Connecticut Forest & Park Association are also known as the 'Connecticut 400' for their total length in miles in the early 1970s. List of trails The list of Blue-Blazed (maintained by the CFPA) and other trails listed in the current Connecticut Walk Books and/or CFPA website are: Blue Trail \\"Blazing\\", Signage and other Markers File:CFPAHousatonicRangeTrailBlueTrailSign2.jpg|An example of several different trail markers in use: wooden sign, blue diamond sign, light blue paint blazes.

While the light blue paint blazes are usually vertical rectangles painted on trees to mark the trail, there is often a bit of variety in terms of both paint blazes and signage found on a Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail. Usually direction is indicated with one blaze to indicate 'go straight ahead', two blazes with the top blaze to the left indicating a left turn, two blazes with the top blaze to the right indicating a right turn, and two blazes directly on top of each other indicating the end of a trail (two parallel horizontal rectangles is the new preferred form). Three blazes indicates that the trail is forking in two different directions (as in a loop). But directional arrows are also often painted on rocks, trees and other stationary objects, particularly when they can provide better information (such as 'Up!' on a rock climb). Occasionally sticks or poles places in the ground are used instead of trees (especially in open fields) with a blue blaze or the top painted blue. Blue blazes are painted on telephone poles, road guard rails, buildings (rarely) and other signs (rarely). Sometimes wooden tags or wooden arrows are nailed to trees (or sticks stuck in the ground) though this is much more common on non-Blue-Blazed trails. Some trail sections are marked using blue plastic diamond signs or metallic disks nailed in trees rather than painted blazes. Signs indicating the terminus, parking area, intersection of side trails or other points of interest may vary also, from painted or carved/engraved/routed handmade wooden signs on trees or posts to framed glass official CFPA professionally printed white background signs to pieces of paper in plastic protectors (either handwritten or computer printed or copied). The terminus points for major Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails and some side trails on the side of a paved road is usually marked with the signature professional blue oval sign indicating the name of the trail. These are mounted on metal posts driven deep into the ground. File:BlueBlazeTrailStraightBlaze.jpg|Blue Blaze signaling to proceed straight at the intersection.

History On December 27, 1929 at the Graduate Club in New Haven the Reverend Edgar Heermance (Connecticut Forest & Park Association's Secretary) met with several companions and described his idea for the Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail System. The group embraced the concept and formed the first CFPA \\"Trails Committee\\". The Quinnipiac Trail was the first Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail created, followed by the Metacomet Trail and Mattabesett Trail in 1931‚Äì1932. During the Depression the size of the Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail system expanded both in total length and the number of trails. In many cases unemployed workers were used to help build the trails as well as other projects in Connecticut's parks and forests as a part of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and similar (e.g. state and municipal) work camps and programs. After rapid growth in the 1930s persisting into the mid-1940s, the post-\\"World War 2\\" housing boom began to encroach upon sections of the Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails, particularly in heavily populated areas affected by the move from urban cities to suburban developments. This trend continued in the latter half of the twentieth century, accelerating in some cases, and even expanding in the new millennium following a new trend of prosperous residents moving to large expensive houses on multi-acre lots in rural exurbs far from population centers (often derisively nicknamed \\"McMansions\\"). Residential housing and follow-on commercial development caused hiking trails to be re-routed or disappear altogether if a suitable detour could not be found. The route of the original (much longer) Naugatuck Trail and several other CFPA trails blazed in the 1930s can be seen in the Connecticut Forest & Park Association's 1940 Connecticut Walk Book map of major trails. On the same map you can see that at one point in time almost all of the major Blue-Blazed Trails west of the Connecticut River were interconnected (the Appalachian, Mattatuck, Tunxis, Quinnipiac, Mattabesett, Metacomet, Naugatuck, Pomeraug and Paugusett). Several trails were truncated or were broken into pieces with gaps (e.g. the Tunxis and Mattatuck trails). References to lost or vestigial portions of Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails can still be found in the land use planning documents of local municipalities such as recommendations to purchase for open space several tracts of land over which the Naugatuck Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail once traveled (e.g. April 1998 Town of Bethany Conservation Commission's 'Open Space Plan'http://www.bethany- ct.com/docs/ConservationCommission/OpenSpacePlan.pdf). The number of Blue- Blazed Hiking Trails and their total mileage have continued to increase in recent years. The Saugatuck and Aspetuck Valley Blue-Blazed hiking trails in Fairfield County were added in 2005 and 2006 respectively as a result of agreements reached between the CFPA, Nature Conservancy, the State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Aquarion Water Company (previously the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company). In 2014, the two trails were joined to create over 18 miles on continuous trail is the heart of Fairfield County. Recognition / Inspiration Programs The Connecticut Forest & Park Association (CFPA) offers the Blue Trails Challenge. Hike any of the trails in the Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail System, log your miles, and earn prizes. There are three categories (200, 400, and 800 miles). In 1974 the Connecticut 400 Club award was established by the Connecticut Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) to recognize those who have hiked the entire length of all of the trails (Blue-Blazed and not, main line, connector and others) listed in the Connecticut Walk Books. The Connecticut Walk Book West (2006, 19th ed.) includes a Connecticut 400 Club hiking log and instructions on submitting the log for the award. The State of Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) Forestry Division provides two awards for locating and visiting \\"letterboxes\\" (similar to geocaches) in Connecticut's State Forests. The commemorative 'State Forest Centennial Patch' is available to those who complete five sponsored \\"letterbox\\" hikes (in each separate state forest you must hike the described route, find the \\"letterbox/cache\\" and record your visit in the \\"letterbox\\" book). The State Forest Centennial campaign dates to 2003 (the centennial of the first official state forest in Connecticut). A walking stick is available for those who complete the letterbox hike of all thirty-two (32) of the state forests. Many of the Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails in Connecticut travel through or near one or more of the State Forests, often very close to the sponsored (DEEP) letterbox. On Video In 2012, the CFPA created a series of videos highlighting 10 of the Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails. The series, \\"Tales From The Trails\\", was funded by the state Office of Culture & Tourism, and promoted via their YouTube channel.

He argued for the continued relevance and importance of the tradition of literary humanism championed by Matthew Arnold and later, Irving Babbitt and Paul Elmer Moore. At the same time he opposed many of the dominant trends in Academia regarding literary criticism and the teaching of literature, such as the Cultural Studies model instituted by Herbert Marcuse and the general emphasis away from the study of literary works themselves in favor of a focus on critical theory. Biography James Seaton was born in Iowa, received B. A. from the University of Illinois at Urbana, and earned a Ph.D. in English and Comparative Literature with a major in Greek and Latin from the University of Iowa. He was a professor in the Department of English at Michigan State University, where he taught from 1971 until his passing. Seaton was married to playwright Sandra Seaton. James Seaton wrote or edited five books. He was a regular contributor to The Weekly Standard, and his essays and reviews have also appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The Hudson Review, The American Scholar (magazine), Yale Journal of Law and Humanities, First Things, Modern Age, The University Bookman, The Review of Metaphysics and The Journal of the History of Ideashttp://jhi.pennpress.org/strands/jhi/home.htm;jsessionid=E730937D722B2C9FA5B49B6D7C6DCD2C and many other academic and non-academic publications. Literary criticism Among Seaton's central contentions were that literary criticism and instruction should prioritize literature over theory, a position he had opportunity to express during C-Span's Teaching Literature conference marking the 10th anniversary of Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind, held at the University of Chicago. In his closing statements of that address, Dr. Seaton predicted that the Humanistic Tradition would survive so long as \\"novels, plays, poems and even intellectual biographies such as The Closing of the American Mind continue to exert their hold on us, through the postmodern era and beyond\\" because \\"its only necessary ground is the authority and significance of literature.\\" In his 2014 book, Literary Criticism from Plato to Postmodernism: The Humanistic Alternative, he presented the notion that the history of literary criticism could be broadly conceived of as a conversation between three distinct but at times overlapping traditions, the Platonic tradition which judged literature by the extent to which it conveyed the proper political messages, the Neoplatonic which romanticized literature as a gateway to transcendent knowledge and the Humanistic tradition, which valued literature for its potential to offer insight into the human experience. In his favorable review of the book for the Wall Street Journal, Barton Swaim referred to the book as an \\"eloquent complaint.\\" Publications  Books written or edited by Seaton  *Literary Criticism from Plato to Postmodernism: The Humanistic Alternative by James Seaton.

He is a layman, in the sense of not being ordained as a deacon or priest, and usually lives in a religious community and works in a ministry appropriate to his capabilities. A brother might practice any secular occupation. The term \\"brother\\" is used as he is expected to be as a brother to others. Brothers are members of a variety of religious communities, which may be contemplative, monastic, or apostolic in character. Some religious institutes are composed only of brothers; others are so-called \\"mixed\\" communities that are made up of brothers and clerics (priests or ministers, and seminarians). It is also common in many Christian groups to refer to other members as \\"brother\\" or \\"sister\\". In particular, the Christian Shakers use the title for all male adult members. History As monasticism developed in the early days of Christianity, most monks remained laymen, as ordination to ministry was seen as a hindrance to the monks' vocation to a contemplative life. Guided by the Rule of St. Benedict, the main lifestyle they followed was either agricultural or that of a desert hermit. Various forces and trends through the Middle Ages led to the situation where monks were no longer following this manner of living. Instead, they were focusing primarily on the religious obligations of intercessory prayer, especially for donors to the monasteries. This was encouraged by a spiritual reliance among the general membership of the Catholic Church upon the prayers of monastics to achieve salvation. One practical consequence of this situation was that the bulk of the physical work which needed to be done for the simple survival of the monastic community came to be done by men who volunteered their services on a full-time basis, and who followed a less severe regimen of prayer. Called donates or oblati, they were not considered to be monks, but they were nonetheless gradually accepted as members of the monastic community. A church, a monk with lay brother & a praying man (from an illustrated medieval manuscript) In other communities, a separate labor force of \\"lay brothers\\" or conversi was cultivated in order to handle the temporal business of the abbey. These men were professed members of the community but were restricted to ancillary roles of manual labor. A rigid class system emerged from this arrangement in which the clerics (priests and seminarians) exercised complete control over the lay brothers. In some cases, lay brothers received little or no formal education, could neither hold office nor vote within their communities, and were forbidden from passing from the lay to the clerical state. In its worst form, this class system resulted in a master-slave relationship between clerics and lay brothers. This inequality between two groups of vowed religious men was not addressed by the institutional leadership of the Catholic Church until the Second Vatican Council. In the 17th century, education of the poorer classes began to be seen as a means of providing charity, which had always been a mandate of Christianity. A leading figure of this approach was St. Jean Baptiste de la Salle, a canon of Reims cathedral, who began to help the poor children of the city. As he was gradually drawn into education as a means for this purpose, he established a new congregation of men for this work, who were called the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. De la Salle had initially intended the Institute to be composed of both ordained and lay members, but the death of the candidates he sent to Rome for ordination while en route convinced him to keep the Institute composed only of laymen. Thus the establishment of a recognized status of \\"brother\\" as other than an agricultural laborer came to emerge in the Church. The social devastations of the 18th and 19th centuries saw the gradual emergence of other similar congregations of men, dedicated primarily to education. Other examples of such congregations are the Marist Brothers, the Brothers of Holy Cross, the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (also known as the De La Salle Brothers), Brothers of Christian Instruction of St Gabriel (Gabrielites) and the Congregation of Christian Brothers. Anglicanism In the Anglican Communion, the term \\"brother\\" is also used to refer to non-ordained members of a religious order, such as the Little Brothers of Francis. Catholicism Religious brothers today The establishment of congregation of brothers started to boom during the 17th century such as the De La Salle Brothers. Since the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) many brothers have moved toward professional and academic occupations, especially in the areas of nursing, education, peace, and justice. Brothers in communities with priests and seminarians often undertake advanced studies and enjoy equal standing with ordained members. Today, most brothers such as in the United States serve in some type of professional, technical, or academic ministry. Many serve as chaplains or teachers/faculty members at schools and universities run by their respective orders. In addition, most brothers undertake some studies in spirituality, religious studies, and theology. Today there are more opportunities than ever for brothers in the Church. Brothers can be members of congregations that are made up only of brothers or they may belong to so- called \\"mixed\\" communities that include seminarians and priests. These congregations may be primarily contemplative or apostolic in nature; many try to balance both aspects of religious life. Brothers in the United States and elsewhere have access to an advanced education that is suited to their interests and talents. In mixed communities, brothers may collaborate with seminarians and priests or may minister independently of them. Brothers share equal status and rights with seminarians and priests in their communities with the exception that canon law currently requires that mixed communities elect an ordained minister as provincial; however, some dispensations to this rule have been granted. Brothers may be elected to provincial councils and other leadership positions. The most acceptable term currently for the brother's vocation is \\"religious brother\\", and the vocational title is \\"Brother,\\" sometimes abbreviated as \\"Bro.\\" or \\"Br.\\" The generic use of the term \\"brother\\" to describe fraternal or spiritual relationships between men in communities can sometimes lead to confusion about what it means to be a \\"brother\\" (religious). According to canon law, brothers are neither \\"lay nor clerical\\" but instead belong to the religious state of life. Hence, the vocational title \\"brother\\" is generally not used by seminarians (other than in monastic or mendicant Orders) in order to avoid the impression that being a brother is a developmental phase of clerical formation. However, as equal members of the same community, both priests and brothers would consider themselves brothers in the fraternal, communal sense of the term. The term \\"lay brother\\" is considered offensive by some brothers since the word \\"lay\\" was once interpreted in this context to mean \\"illiterate\\" or \\"uneducated\\". However, in canon law it simply means \\"not clerical\\" or \\"not ordained\\".

The week comprises a number of exhibitions, workshops and networking sessions focused on key issues within the energy industry. The first event was held in 2008 (when it was called the International Energy Week). The event is organised by Singapore's Energy Market Authority (EMA). Events 2008: \\"Powering Cities of the Future\\" The inaugural International Energy Week took place from 3‚Äì7 November 2008 at the Raffles City Convention Centre, Singapore, and was attended by 2500 people. Program topics featured a range of industry topics addressing energy investment, energy efficiency, traditional, renewable and alternative energies, climate change, and green architecture. Program highlights included the delivery of the inaugural Singapore Energy Lecture by Lee Kuan Yew, former Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore to an audience of 500 people, and presentations by industry leaders and multi- national energy companies. During the event, the Government of Singapore announced the establishment of a 25 million Singapore dollars (16.8 million U.S. dollars) Energy Research and Development Fund to support the proliferation of new energy technologies in Singapore. Also during the event, Vestas Wind Systems, an official partner of Singapore International Energy in 2008, opened its largest research facility outside of its home country of Denmark. 2009: \\"Clean Energy: Sustainable Solutions for Urban Cities\\" Singapore International Energy Week 2009 took place from 16‚Äì20 November at the Shangri-la Hotel in Singapore. Over 1,800 companies and 5,000 participants registered for events during the week. On the opening day, the second annual Singapore Energy Lecture was delivered by Daniel Yergin, the Chairman & co- founder of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. In his speech, Yergin discussed the development of unconventional shale gas, calling it \\"one of the most important innovations of this decade\\" \\\\- and that the use of natural gas is expected to grow substantially in Asia, especially in Liquefied natural gas (LNG) form. He also said that oil supply will be supplied by the use of technological innovations, as only about a fifth of the oil reserves that could be recovered had been extracted. Also on the first day, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair shared his views about balancing climate change and global energy needs, in a video message shown on the first day. The Clean Energy Expo Asia (CEEA) - a trade fair and conference- took place during the event. The Expo featured five pavilions, showcasing clean energy solutions from Australia, Brazil, Europe, Japan and Singapore. The EMA's Deputy Chief Executive, David Tan, delivered an address at the Expo. During the event, the EMA hosted the inaugural Singapore Electric Vehicle Roundtable where the \\"challenges and solutions in EV implementation\\" were discussed. The EMA also announced a project to power Pulau Ubin (one of Singapore's islands) completely with renewable energy. At the time of the announcement, the island had no power grid. The EMA also announced a 'smart' electrical grid project to be implemented at the Nanyang Technological University and the Jalan Bahar Cleantech Park. This was announced at the opening address to the Smart Grids Conference by Lawrence Wong (Chief Executive of the EMA). The Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (headed by Joachim Luther) was officially opened, with the stated aim of \\"investing $130 million into the industry in the next five years.\\" Other events included the launch of World Energy Outlook 2009 by the International Energy Agency's Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka, the Singapore Electricity Roundtable and the Platts 4th Annual Top 250 Global Energy Companies Awards and Leadership Dinner (part of a three-year partnership between Platts and EMA). A number of energy industry experts including Alan Bryden (Ing√©nieur G√©n√©ral of the High Council for Industry, Energy and Technologies, France), Nobuo Tanaka (Executive Director of the International Energy Agency), Bill Hogan (Research Director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group) and David Hone (Royal Dutch Shell's senior adviser on climate change) spoke during the week. 2010: \\"Fueling the Smart Energy Economy\\" The third Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) took place from 27 October to 4 November 2010. For the first time, Panasonic acted as a main sponsor for the event. Approximately 14,000 people were involved with the event, including government officials, business leaders, academics, investors, as well as representatives from energy-resource and environmental companies from 60 countries. On 1 November, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delivered the Singapore Energy Lecture, where he discussed Singapore's energy plans in an uncertain time with regard to future prices and climate change. He also discussed the possibility of a nuclear power plant on Singapore \\"possibly during my life time... we cannot afford to dismiss the option of nuclear power altogether\\". The Lecture was followed by the inaugural Singapore Energy Summit, where efficient energy use, investment in technology, exploration of renewable and alternative energy sources and the smarter use of fossil fuels were discussed. On 2 November, at the Power-GEN Asia Conference, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Education, S. Iswaran announced Singapore's plans to build a third liquefied natural gas (LNG) tank. Other events held during SIEW 2010 included Carbon Forum Asia, Clean Energy Expo Asia, IPEC (International Power and Energy Conference) 2010, Platts Top 250 Awards Dinner, Singapore Electricity Roundtable, Bloomberg New Energy Finance Dinner and Downstream Asia. 2011: \\"Securing our Energy Future\\" The fourth Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) took place from 31 October to 4 November 2011. 20,000 people and 550 exhibitors participated in the event, including government officials, business leaders, academics, investors, as well as representatives from energy-resource and environmental companies from 60 countries. On 31 October, former executive director of the International Energy Agency Nobuo Tanaka delivered the Singapore Energy Lecture, where he shared his \\"21st century energy security\\" vision and called for Asia's emerging economies to engage in more active collaborations for the future. He noted that one country cannot enhance its energy security by risking the energy security of others, and thus the need for a new framework on energy security. The Lecture was followed by the Singapore Energy Summit, where global energy leaders took the stage to discuss pertinent energy issues. Sharing the stage for the first time were the CEOs of Royal Dutch Shell and Petrobras, Peter Voser and Jos√© Gabrielli respectively, as they discuss the future of the global energy industry. According to Peter Voser, Shell expects Asia to be a key growth region in the long term. However, energy leaders at the Singapore Energy Summit also stated that Asia faces a rocky road ahead in securing energy needs. Giving their perspectives on energy security concerns and new trends in the power industry at the Singapore Energy Summit, Singapore's Second Minister S. Iswaran, Malaysia's Dato' Sri Idris Jala, and the Philippines' Secretary of Energy Jose Rene Almendras unanimously agreed that a connected Asean power grid was a crucial step for energy security in the region. Such a grid, to be done in phases, would integrate Asean's energy markets, and would require investments into trans-Asean gas pipelines and expanding connections between member countries. Minister S. Iswaran also stated that such plans needed clear political direction at the regional and national levels, adding that an Asean energy grid would serve individual national interests as well as the region as a whole. The annual energy gathering also hosted three new major events, PV Asia Pacific Expo, Asia Smart Grid and the EMART Asia, covering a range of issues including energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy trading. Returning to SIEW this year were Clean Energy Expo Asia, Carbon Forum Asia, Downstream Asia, Singapore Electricity Roundtable, and the Platts Top 250 Global Energy Companies Asia Awards Dinner. 2012: \\"Shaping a New Energy Landscape\\" SIEW 2012 took place from 22 to 25 October at the Sands Expo & Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands Singapore. With the theme of \\"Shaping a New Energy Landscape\\", Singapore's Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Home Affairs & Trade and Industry, S. Iswaran, made several announcements with regard to Singapore's energy security. This included the city-state's plans to build a fourth liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage tank at the LNG terminal on Jurong Island, which would open up opportunities in global LNG markets. The Opening Keynote Address was presented by International Energy Agency Director Maria van der Hoeven with the theme of \\"Asia and the Global Energy Economy\\". She shared that Singapore was well-placed to be an Asian gas hub \\"faster than anyone else in the region\\". Ms van der Hoeven also underscored that natural gas will be vital to powering Asia's massive electrification in the years ahead. Other energy leaders spoke as well, including Malaysia's Minister of Energy Peter Chin Fah Kui, Lao's Minister of Energy and Mines Soulivong Daravong, the Director General of the International Renewable Energy Agency Dr Adnan Z Amin, and the President of Carbon War Room (an independent non-profit organisation focused on the global transition to a low carbon economy) and former President of Costa Rica Jose Maria Figueres. They discussed topics ranging from options for a future energy mix to financing the energy needs of tomorrow, from climate change and connecting the dots for the energy-water- food nexus. The event hosted two new events: # Gas Asia Summit (GAS), presenting the first dedicated Asian gas and LNG conference to respond to the region's natural gas and LNG demand and energy supply security. # Asia Future Energy Forum (AFEF):, the Asia debut of the World Future Energy Forum on leading-edge sustainable energy governance, business, investment, finance, and technology that enable smart delivery of clean energy solutions.

It highlights the need to transform our energy ambitions into actionable solutions, as the energy landscape continues to experience major shifts. Global energy demand is expanding, and this is especially pronounced in Asia. The growth in energy demand will be driven by the electrification of transportation, industries and buildings. This demand has been supported by increased supply of oil and gas, lowered cost of renewables and technological advancements in energy storage. However, there remain concerns over meeting climate change commitments, even as renewable energy investments hit record highs. Against this backdrop, SIEW will provide a platform for global energy stakeholders to deliberate on and accelerate the transformation toward a more sustainable energy future. \\\\---- References External links  Energy Market Authority * Asia Clean Energy Summit * Asian Downstream Summit Category:Conferences ","title":"Singapore International Energy Week"},{"id":"24471021","text":"Yevgeni Andreyev may refer to: * Yevgeni Nikolayevich Andreyev (1926-2000), Air Force Colonel, parachute tester, Hero of the Soviet Union (1962). * Yevgeni Andreyev (volleyball), Kazakhstani volleyball player who participated in the 2006 FIVB Men's World Championship * Yevgeni Stepanovich Andreyev (born 1988), Russian footballer ","title":"Yevgeni Andreyev"},{"id":"24471025","text":"In gridiron football, a player who steps onto the sidelines during play is considered to be out of bounds In sports, out of bounds (or out-of-bounds) refers to being outside the playing boundaries of the field. Due to the chaotic nature of play, it is normal in many sports for players and/or the ball to go out of bounds frequently during a game. The legality of going out of bounds (intentionally or not), and the ease of prevention, vary by sport. In some cases, players may intentionally go or send the ball out of bounds when it is to their advantage. Baseball In baseball, there are two ways for a batted ball to be out-of-bounds. One is to exit the field of play between the foul lines. If this is achieved without touching the ground first, it is a home run, and the batter and teammates who are on base run to home plate and score a point for their team. If the ball bounced off the ground before exiting play, it is a ground rule double, and the batter and all runners not on third advance exactly two bases; runners only score if they were on second or third base. If the ball is hit outside the foul lines (such as to the side or behind the batter), it is a foul ball, and is equivalent to a strike, unless the batter has two strikes (in that instance, the strike count remains at two). The foul ball bounds do not apply to fielders, who are allowed to try to catch a foul ball, which would put the batter out. While the rules of baseball define the angle of the foul lines, there are no set rules as to how large a field should be, and it varies from baseball field to baseball field. Whether fielders can attempt to catch balls in dugouts or the stands varies. In major league baseball, it is possible in baseball for a dugout to be a factor in play. MLB rule 6.05(a) states that a fielder may reach into a dugout to catch a fly ball as long as one or both feet is on or over the playing field, and does not have a foot on the ground in the dugout when making the catch. MLB universal ground rules state that the player may subsequently enter the dugout after making the catch if his momentum is carrying him that way, but if he falls in the dugout as a result, the catch is allowed but baserunners advance in accordance with Rule 7.04(c).[3] A live ball entering a dugout becomes dead and the batter-runner and any baserunners advance in accordance with Rule 7.04(c). However, a live ball bouncing off a dugout railing, if present, is still in play (unless a foul ball). Due to the dugouts' location in foul territory, live balls entering dugouts usually only occur after an errant throw by the defensive team. Individual leagues at levels below MLB are free to set their own rules governing the dugouts as is appropriate for their league's ballparks and playing level. For example, the rule governing reaching into dugouts to catch fly balls would not apply in leagues where the dugouts are separated from the field by a chain-link fence that is taller than the players. Basketball When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the court and played by the first person touching it. In case of dispute, the referee shall throw it straight into the court. The thrower-in is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the referee shall call a foul on that side. Football Australian rules In Australian rules football, the ball is considered out of bounds when the whole of the ball is outside the plane of boundary line; or, if any part of the ball touches the behind post. Under most circumstances, play is restarted by means of a boundary throw-in after it has gone out of bounds: the boundary umpire throws the ball high in the air and backwards over his head to a neutral contest 15-20m in from the line. Under the following circumstances, a free kick awarded against the team who put the ball out of bounds: *If the ball goes out of bounds on the full (without touching anything else first) from a kick *If the ball is forced deliberately out of bounds (decided at the discretion of the field umpire) Gridiron code In gridiron football, a play is considered to be dead if a ball or the player carrying the ball goes out of bounds. A forward pass thrown to a player who has one (in the NCAA) or both (in most other codes including the NFL) feet on the ground out of bounds is considered an incomplete pass regardless of whether it was caught or not. In the NFL, the clock stops whenever a player carrying the ball steps out of bounds or fumbles the ball out of bounds. Within the last 2 minutes of the first half, the last 5 minutes of the game, or after a change of possession, the clock remains stopped until the next snap; at all other times, the clock restarts when the referee signals indicating that the ball has been placed for the next down. In arena football, the field is walled so that play can almost never go out of bounds. At all other times, the clock keeps ticking. In college football, the clock stops when the ballcarrier goes out of bounds. If there are more than two minutes left in either half, the clock resumes when the umpire marks the ball as ready for the next play. If there are less than two minutes left in the half, the clock resumes upon the next play. If the player with the ball goes out of bounds in his own end zone, in most cases, it is considered to be a safety in favor of the other team. A ball kicked out of bounds through the end zone is a touchback; in Canadian football, this situation usually is awarded a single point. A kickoff that goes out of bounds is a penalty. Up through 1986, this required the kicking team to rekick the ball from five yards behind the spot of the original kickoff, unless the penalty was declined by the receiving team. In 1987, the NFL instituted a new rule, where the ball would be awarded to the receiving team five yards ahead of the spot where it went out of bounds. In Canadian football, if a fumble goes out of bounds, the team of the last player to touch it gets possession. Association code (Soccer) In association football, the ball becomes out of play when it has entirely crossed a goal line or touch line. Play is restarted by a throw-in, goal kick or corner kick. Ice hockey In ice hockey, if the puck gets knocked out of play (such as into the player's benches, over the glass, or into the netting), a face-off shall be conducted at the nearest face-off dot to where the puck had gone out of play. However, if the puck is directly shot out of bounds over the glass deliberately by a player such as a goaltender or any defensive player within their own defensive zone, a delay of game minor penalty shall be assessed on the offending player. Golf In golf, \\"Out of Bounds\\" is beyond the boundaries of the golf course or any part of the course so marked by the committee in charge of the competition or the golf course. If a ball is out of bounds, the player must play a ball, under penalty of one stroke, as nearly as possible at the spot from which the original ball was last played. Reference: Rules of Golf 2012-2015, Rule 27-1 b. Ball Out of Bounds, published by the R&A; \\\\- and approved by the United States Golf Association (USGA). A golf ball is out of bounds when all of it lies out of bounds. A player may stand out of bounds to play a ball lying within bounds. Reference: Rules of Golf 2012-2015, Section II Definitions. Skiing In skiing, an out of bounds area is considered one that is outside of the area owned/serviced by a ski resort. Out of bounds areas can either be accessed by ducking under a rope or fence, or through marked gates. Usually, if one is caught 'cutting a rope', one will lose skiing privileges at the ski resort; depending on where one does so, they may also be arrested for trespassing. Out of bounds areas are not serviced by any type of lift, thus one must usually hike out of the area. Also, out of bounds areas are not serviced by a resorts ski patrol and are not checked for avalanche potential, thus one must be properly equipped for avalanche rescue and understand that a rescue may be incredibly costly.

Geography Gayville centers upon the intersection of County Route 23, County Route 23A, and Grannis Road. Within Gayville Potter Creek joins Scriba Creek, which flows southward to empty into Oneida Lake. History Before the American Revolution, the eastern portion of what is now Oswego County was part of the territory of the Oneida Nation. Although there were no known settlements in the region, the Oneidas used the land for hunting and fishing. Oneida Lake provided their principal means of transportation. To reach Lake Ontario, approximately north of Oneida Lake, they would canoe up Scriba Creek. About north, where Scriba Creek bears eastward, they began an portage, traveling overland to Little Salmon Creek, which took them to Lake Ontario. This route was preferable to continuing to the end of Oneida Lake, down the Onondaga River (now known as the Oneida River), and down the Oswego River. The Oswego River route was about longer, and it passed the rapids at Oswego Falls (now known as Fulton) and ended at the military fortifications of Fort Ontario and Fort Oswego. After the Revolution, the government of New York acquired vast inland territories from the Oneida Nation and sold the land to speculators. George Scriba, born in Germany and a naturalized citizen of New York, purchased of land in what is still known as Scriba's Patent.Simpson, Elizabeth M. Mexico, Mother of Towns, 1949. He established two villages that were to serve as ports: on Oneida Lake, at the mouth of Scriba Creek, he built Rotterdam, now known as Constantia. On Lake Ontario, at the mouth of Little Salmon Creek, he built Vera Cruz, near the present-day hamlet of Texas. He had a road cut through the forests between the two settlements. This road paralleled Scriba Creek, followed the route of the Oneida Nation portage, and paralleled Little Salmon Creek. Although it was never accomplished, he also envisioned creating a canal along the Oneida Nation portage between the two creeks.Young, Charles D. A Scriba Anthology, Volume 1, 1996 Among the many hamlets of farming families that developed along the route of the Rotterdam-Vera Cruz road was Gayville. Its name came from early landowners Erastus and Charlotte Gay, who purchased all of Lot 14 in Section 11 (the town of Constantia) in 1831. Lot 14 was about a quarter of the land in the area that came to be known as Gayville. In 1854 they lost the land in a mortgage foreclosure, and they left the area, leaving their name in common usage. The road from Constantia was called the Gayville Road, and when the sixth school district was established in the town of Constantia it was called the Gayville District. The district operated until 1952, when the New York State Education Department consolidated small rural district schools into central districts, and Gayville became part of the Central Square Central Schools.Mexico Independent, Thursday, August 21, 1952 The Gayville Post Office was established in 1880.Buffalo Courier, Monday Morning, June 28, 1880 Between 1900 and 1910 the Rural Free Delivery system was established, and the Gayville Post Office closed.Grace Lynch: The Way It Used to Be Once more the residents of Gayville received their mail from the Post Office in Constantia Village. At one time Gayville had a hotel with a ballroom and bar, several sawmills, and a Methodist Protestant congregation that met in the schoolhouse. Present community Gayville today is a residential community. A number of original farmhouses and a few barns remain, but most of the homes are contemporary. No trace can be seen of the schoolhouse, hotel, or mills.

In 2018, he wrote an article related to his interview with Pope Francis stating that the pontiff made claims that hell did not exist. Early life Scalfari was born in Civitavecchia (Rome) on April 6, 1924. Scalfari began secondary studies at the Mamiani High School in Rome. Scalfari's family, of Calabrian origin, later moved to Sanremo (where his father was artistic director of the Casino) and he completed his high school studies there, at the G.D. Cassini school, where Italo Calvino was a classmate.Sull'amicizia tra Scalfari e Calvino leggiamo: \\"Caro Eugenio, le tue lettere sono come manate sulla schiena e io ne ho bisogno di manate sulla schiena, specie di questi tempi.\\"(...) Mi viene l'acquolina in bocca pensando alle ghiotte discussioni che faremo quando ci ritroveremo insieme\\", cfr. Angelo Cannat√† \\"Eugenio Scalfari e il suo tempo\\", Mimesis, 2010, p. 105. In 1950 Scalfari married Simonetta, daughter of the journalist Giulio De Benedetti; she died in 2006. From the end of the seventies Scalfari was romantically linked to Serena Rossetti, former editorial secretary of L'Espresso (and later of La Repubblica), whom he married after the death of his wife Simonetta.Paolo Guzzanti, Guzzanti vs De Benedetti. Faccia a faccia fra un gran editore e un giornalista scomodo, Aliberti editore, 2010 Career A law graduate with an interest in journalism and politics, Scalfari worked for the influential postwar magazines Il Mondo and L'Europeo. In 1955 he was among the founders of the Radical Party.Encyclopedia of contemporary Italian culture, CRC Press, 2000, p. 747 In October 1955, jointly with Arrigo Benedetti he co-founded one of Italy's foremost newsmagazines L'Espresso with capital from the progressive industrialist Adriano Olivetti, manufacturer of Olivetti typewriters. The experienced Benedetti, who had directed the newsmagazine L'Europeo (1945‚Äì54), was the first editor-in-chief until 1963, when he handed over to Scalfari. In January 1976 the Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso also launched the centre-left daily newspaper La Repubblica in a joint venture with Arnoldo Mondadori Editore. Scalfari became the editor-in-chief and remained so until 1996. Few believed such a venture could succeed in the already crowded Italian newspaper market, but under Scalfari‚Äôs skilful editorship La Repubblica prospered to the point of rivaling the prestigious Corriere della Sera in both sales and status as a national daily. He remains active in both La Repubblica and L'Espresso. He has also published a number of books including l‚ÄôAutunno della Repubblica (Autumn of the Republic) (1969) and the novel Il Labirinto (The Labyrinth) (1998). Notable reporting As a journalist, he was especially active in investigative reporting, uncovering illegal right-wing activities and major government cover-ups. With Lino Jannuzzi he uncovered the attempted 1964 coup d'√©tat by General Giovanni Di Lorenzo in May 1967. In July 2014, he reported, in an interview, Pope Francis's controversial statement that approximately 2% of the Catholic Church's total number of priests, including bishops and cardinals, were pedophiles. In 2018, Scalfari wrote an article related to his interview with Pope Francis stating that the pontiff made claims that hell did not exist. Scalfari later admitted that some words attributed to the pontiff \\"were not shared by Pope Francis\\" himself. Later in 2019, he wrote a further article related to Pope Francis, claiming that the pope \\"rejects the godly nature of Jesus Christ\\". This was denied by the Holy See, which said that \\"as already stated on other occasions, the words that Dr. Eugenio Scalfari attributes in quotation marks to the Holy Father during talks with him cannot be considered a faithful account of what was actually said but represent a personal and free interpretation of what he heard, as appears completely evident from what is written today regarding the divinity of Jesus Christ\\". Politics Eugenio Scalfari in 2011. Initially, like many Italians of the time, Scalfari was a committed fascist, and described himself as \\"Young, happy and fascist\\". After the Second World War, Scalfari was close to the Italian Liberal Party, but in 1956 he participated in the split from the party of the \\"Radicals\\" (leftist liberals), such as Marco Pannella and Ernesto Rossi, that formed the Radical Party. In 1968, Scalfari was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies (1968‚Äì1972) as an independent aligned with the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and handed over his post as editor to Gianni Corbi. Political positions Scalfari described himself as libertarian, but also \\"liberal of social mold\\". He was pro-choice in the referendums of 1981. Personal He is an atheist. In 2013, he received a personal and detailed explanation from Pope Francis about atheism and forgiveness.

Haven drew its influences from bands such as, Queensr√øche, Metallica, King Diamond, and Dream Theater. Haven split shortly after the completion of the \\"Age of Darkness\\" release. History Origins In the mid-1980s, Andrew Bruner met Tim Benton at church youth group. The two decided to form a band, with then bass player Steve Forenza. The trio then acquired a friend of Steve Forenza, Craig Carlson for vocals. Because of problems with Steve Forenza, Ed Bruner was then brought on to play bass for the band. It was at this point that Haven recorded a 4-song demo at a local recording studio in Cinnaminson New Jersey. Lineup Changes Andrew Bruner, Tim Benton, and Ed Bruner, all highly devoted Christians decided to take a more overtly Christian direction with Haven and had to release Craig Carlson from the band. In an effort to fill the need for a vocalist, the remaining members posted flyers at local Christian bookstores for a singer. Kevin Ayers and demo In 1988, Kevin Ayers responded to the advertisement and was accepted as the new singer. Kevin's newly rededicated faith and musical experience brought a fresh new inspiration and direction to Haven. In 1989, Haven began to perform at local clubs and explore record deals with a home-made 4 song demo with added guitarist Chad McKee. Signing to R.E.X. Records In 1989, Haven was invited to Sacrament's signing party, through a friend of former bandmate Craig Carlson. Not long after this event Haven was signed to R.E.X. Records and in 1990 recorded their first record \\"Your Dying Day\\" at Morning Star Studio's in Philadelphia PA. Because of differences, Chad McKee was replaced as the second guitarist with John Farrell. Age Of Darkness The addition of John Farrell brought a new musical influence and heavy guitar harmonies to Haven. In 1992, Haven recorded \\"Age of Darkness\\" at Catamount Studios in Iowa, with Believer's Kurt Bachman as producer. This record took on the opposition to Occultism as a lyrical theme. The track \\"Divination\\" enjoyed a few weeks as No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Breakup In 1992, most of Haven was now in their early 20s. It was at this time that Tim Benton left the band and moved to Atlanta. Tim's leaving had significant impact on the band. However, eager to continue, Haven found a new Drummer, Ed Phelan. Haven continued to prepare the third record for R.E.X. By 1992 it became clear that there would be no third recording, due to the impending demise of R.E.X. Records. It was at this time, that Andrew announced his intention to leave Haven. After the loss of Tim and Andrew, it was commonly believed that Haven was finished. Controversy There have been a few recordings done after the split of Haven that purports to be from the band Haven. These recordings should be viewed mostly as the work of Kevin Ayers and not of Haven. Haven only recorded two records and they were both on R.E.X. Records. Discography * Your Dying Day (1990, R.E.X.

She became a member of the opera chorus there in 1821, made her formal debut in 1823 and progressed to a soloist in 1824. On 1 July 1826, she abruptly resigned to marry sea captain, writer, and impresario Anders Lindeberg, who was then an influential person in Swedish culture life. Her sudden early retirement was seen as surprising because of her successful debut. In 1830, she divorced her husband, officially because of indifference but according to the registers because of adultery on her part, which was illustrated by the fact that her husband was granted custody of their children. After her divorce, she took the name and title of Mrs Enbom. On 1 October 1830, she was given a contract at the Royal Opera. During the 1830s, she was a popular singer at the Royal Opera with many assignments, and successful both as an alto and a soprano in roles such as the Queen of the Night in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Magic Flute, Donna Anna as well as Elvira in Don Juan by Mozart, and Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro.Christina Wilhelmina Enbom (g. Lindeberg), urn:sbl:16076, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Birgitta Lager.), h√§mtad 2018-06-18. Among her most noted parts where the alto Breeches role Malcolm in La Donna del Lago and the title role of Tancredi, both by Gioacchino Rossini and the later of which was staged at the Royal Opera specifically so that she could perform in it (1832). Christina Enbom was described as an artist capable of creating illusion by complying force in both voice and acting, but in lack of the training which could have developed what was a great natural ability: :\\"Her voice with its metallic sound was strong and with great range. It reached almost over tree octaves but was most beautiful as an alto. With her resources :she could have gone far with schooling. She was never given such a thing but she was given a number of main soprano- and alto parts during the 1830s\\". Her lack of training often exposed her to criticism of being uneven in her performances. After the breakthrough of Jenny Lind in 1838, the contrast between a trained and an untrained voice heavily damaged the career and position of Enbom at the Royal Opera. Additionally, she caused a couple of scandals because of her temperament. During a performance of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro in the 1838‚Äì39 season, where she played Countess Almaviva opposite Henriette Widerberg as Susanna, Widerberg entered the stage too soon, which caused Enbom to lose the applause for her aria. Enraged, Enbom spoke her line harshly instead of friendly when she said: \\"Bring my chair!\\", upon which Widerberg answered: \\"Do it yourself, you -\\" after which their lines, as was reported, \\"was given a few extra words, which caused both merriness as well as annoyance\\". Her voice, damaged because it had not been managed properly, also deteriorated during these years of rivalry with Jenny Lind, in which she was supported by her former husband, described as her greatest admirer, but when she was discharged from the Royal Opera in 1841, Orvar Odd remarked that only her former husband still praised \\"the former Mrs Lindeberg's former voice.\\" Orvar Odd in the publication \\"Grupper och personager\\" (1861) wrote of her: :\\"Mrs Enbom was with no doubt, and had with even lesser doubt been, a useful singer: she filled her part, whatever she :was given, but she did so with no particular grace, and she performed it less than she hammered through it. Her performance had always something of a drummer :about it and when she hammered her way through a scene, one was always somewhat worried that she would drop one of her drummer pins on the floor\\". Later life After having discontinued her operatic career, Christina Enbom was active as an actress. In 1843-50, she was active at the Mindre teatern, which was at that time owned by her ex-husband, and in the theater company of Charlotta Djurstr√∂m. In 1850‚Äì56, she was again active at the RSO, but only as a member of chorus. She lived under strained financial circumstances, being supported by her son and a small pension as well as an occasional theater performance to her benefit. She died in Stockholm.  References  * J.

Dating to the 5th‚Äì6th century AD, it lies northeast of Pirdop and from Anton, on the right bank of the Elenska River (–ï–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∞, Elenska reka). The initially domeless basilica, which features thick walls and defensive towers, had a dome added in the mid-6th century, during the reign of Justinian I. The church was ruined in the early 18th century, during the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria. Architecture Bird's eye view of the complex Archaeologists have clearly distinguished two separate building periods based on the basilica's ruins. The Elenska Basilica's middle and western sections are older and constructed out of brick and crushed stones, whereas the more recent eastern section was built out of homogeneous bricks with thick grouts joined using red mortar. Analysis of the church's ruins, which are up to in height, has established that it was a three-naved basilica. The church's dimensions were . It featured a large apse in the centre, flanked by two smaller apses. The middle nave was divided into two squares by four identical columns. The narthex, which lay in the church's western section, accommodated a diaconicon and a prothesis. A baptisterium was located in the church's southern section. A wide defensive wall surrounded the church. Four rectangular defensive towers were located in each corner of the wall. The towers were almost identical in size and measured around . The defensive wall is thought to have been tall. History The Elensko area where the church is located (and which was the basis for its name) was known to have been inhabited in antiquity by a Thracian tribe, who around the 6th‚Äì5th century BC joined the Bessi state. Thracologist Alexander Fol links the area's name (which he derives from the Bulgarian word –µ–ª–µ–Ω elen, \\"deer\\") to an ancient legend about a deer who would descend from the Balkan Mountains on the same day every year to be ritually sacrificed by the natives. Indeed, plenty of deer remains have been unearthed in the vicinity of the basilica. Another theory derives the name of the area from the Bulgarianized name of the Greeks, –µ–ª–∏–Ω–∏ elini (\\"Hellenes\\"), explained by the church's construction in the early Byzantine period. The Elenska Basilica was in active use during the Second Bulgarian Empire (11th‚Äì14th century) as a literary centre and an Eastern Orthodox monastery. A 13th-century literary work in Middle Bulgarian, the Pirdop Acts of the Apostles, may have been authored there, as a legend says it was discovered in the church's ruins in the 19th century. It remained in use until around 1700, when the local Ottoman forces under Yahya Pasha are thought to have purposefully destroyed it during a military campaign. The Ottomans reportedly bombarded the church with cannons and set it ablaze because they regarded the monks as rebellious. The earliest archaeological research on the Elenska Basilica dates to the 1890s, when local teachers explored the ruins. Archaeologist Petar Mutafchiev conducted excavations in 1913 and published his findings in the article The Elenska Basilica in the vicinity of Pirdop. The church has only been slightly reconstructed since then. The basilica's ruins are in a satisfactory and stable condition, though the surrounding defensive wall has been mostly destroyed.

Denominator data are independent of any specific disease or condition. This name is given because in mathematical models of disease, disease-specific data such as the incidence of disease in a population, the susceptibility of the population to a specific condition, the disease resistance, etc. disease- specific variables are expressed as their proportion of some attribute of the general population, and hence appear as the numerator of the fraction or percentage being calculated, general data about the population typically appearing in the denominator; hence the term \\"denominator data.\\" In an epidemiological compartment model, for example, variables are often scaled to total population. The susceptible fraction of a population is obtained by taking the ratio of the number of people susceptible to the total population. Susceptibility to a disease may depend on other factors such as age or sex. Data about a population including age distribution, male/female ratios, and other demographic factors may be relevant as denominator data.

The proposed state was to be called the State of Sequoyah. The convention drafted a constitution, drew up a plan of organization for the government, put together a map showing the counties to be established, and elected delegates to go to the United States Congress to petition for statehood. The convention's proposals were put to a referendum in Indian Territory, and received overwhelming endorsement by voters. However, the delegation received a cool reception in Washington, D.C., due to party politics, and failed to secure its goals. Although unsuccessful, the convention paved the way for the creation of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Background The Five Civilized Tribes and other tribes in Indian territory were generally opposed to local and national efforts for statehood. As mandated by the 1898 Curtis Act, however, United States recognition of tribal governments were to end March 4, 1906, as part of a federal push toward assimilation of Native Americans.Mize, Richard, \\"Sequoyah Convention ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (accessed May 30, 2010) James A. Norman (Cherokee) promoted a constitutional convention to organize an American Indian state. In a 1904 pamphlet he suggested naming the state \\"Sequoyah\\" to honor the Cherokee who had developed the Cherokee syllabary, the first independently created written form of an indigenous language in North America. In July 1905, William Charles Rogers, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, and Green McCurtain, principal chief of the Choctaw Nation issued a call for a convention. The call was amended in late July to add the names of Pleasant Porter and principal chief of the Creek Nation, John Brown principal chief of the Seminoles. Douglas Johnston, Governor of the Chickasaw Nation, opposed calling the convention, so his nation was represented by William H. Murray. Convention The convention met in the Hinton Theater in Muskogee, on August 21, 1905. The convention drafted a constitution, drew up a plan of organization for the government, put together a map showing the counties to be established, and elected delegates to go to the United States Congress to petition for statehood. The convention's proposals were put to a referendum in Indian Territory, and received overwhelming endorsement by voters. The delegation received a cool reception in Washington, D.C., due to party politics. Indian Territory was bordered by two southern Democratic states. The U.S. President, Theodore Roosevelt, was a Republican, and the Republican- controlled Congress wanted joint statehood of the two territories to eliminate the possibility of the territory joining the Union as a Democratic state. On June 16, 1906, President Roosevelt signed the Oklahoma Enabling Act, which ruled that the Indian and Oklahoma territories would be granted statehood only as a combined state.Wilson, Linda D., \\"Statehood Movement,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (accessed May 30, 2010) The convention succeeded in winning approval of a 35,000 word document that would govern the proposed state. It captured a Populist distrust of elected officials. It also assured that several residents of Indian Territory would serve in prominent positions both in the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention and in the forthcoming state that would ensue. The work of the Sequoyah State Constitutional Convention was not entirely lost. When representatives from Indian Territory joined the Oklahoma State Constitutional Convention in Guthrie the next year, they brought their experience with them. The Sequoyah Constitution served in large part as the basis for the constitution of the State of Oklahoma, which came into being with the merger of the two territories in 1907. General Pleasant Porter, Principal Chief of the Muscogee Creek Nation, was selected as president of the convention. The elected delegates decided to appoint the executive officers of the Five Civilized Tribes as vice-presidents of the convention: William Charles Rogers, Principal Chief of the Cherokees; William H. Murray, appointed by Chickasaw Governor Douglas H. Johnston to represent the Chickasaws; Chief Green McCurtain of the Choctaws; Chief John Brown of the Seminoles; and Charles N.

He served with great distinction during the latter, where he commanded the 1st Parachute Brigade in North Africa and the 6th Airlanding Brigade in Normandy, before becoming Deputy Chief of Staff HQ First Allied Airborne Army. Family Background Flavell was born on 22 February 1898 at 15 Stansfield Road, Stockwell, London.The Daily Telegraph obituary, dated 22 December 1993, and most other sources, gives the place of birth as Cookham, Berks. The place of birth is verified from the birth certificate. He was educated at King's College School in Wimbledon, London. Flavell died on 29 November 1993 aged 95. Some sources give 8 November or 1 December 1993 as the date of death. He was the son of Edwin George Flavell and Emily Eliza Flavell (n√©e Conquest) born 1870 and 1874 respectively.

Both of Edwin's sons served during World War II: Edwin James George Flavell (1922‚Äì2014) was a Squadron leader in the Royal Air Force and James Sydney Channel Flavell (1924‚Äì2008) served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 2nd Parachute Battalion ‚Äì Middlesex Regiment. Both brothers were at the ill-fated Battle of Arnhem in 1944 where unfortunately, James Sydney Channell Flavell was captured by Germans and remained a prisoner of war until 1945.http://unithistories.com/units_index/default.asp?file=../officers/1AirbDiv_officersA.htm Edwin married a second time in 1971 to Kathleen Emily Fenton an accomplished concert pianist. In the Ickenham Lodge No. 5770 (Middlesex) Members' Record Book, at the Consecration of the Lodge on 27 February 1939, it is noted that his occupation was \\"company director\\", then living at his Hampstead address. First World War In 1914, during World War I, at the age of 17, Edwin William Conquest Flavell enlisted in the East Surrey Regiment and was commissioned as a second lieutenant five months later. In 1916 he transferred to the newly formed Machine Gun Corps, and in 1917 he was believed to be the youngest major serving in the Flanders area at the age of 20. He was wounded during the Battle of Cambrai in the same year, and by the end of the conflict had been awarded the Military Cross a total of three times (referred to as the Military Cross and two Bars). The first was awarded for taking command of an infantry company that had lost all of its officers; by his leadership the unit was able to continue advancing. The second (his first bar) was for conducting several personal reconnaissances of enemy positions. In mid-March 1918, Flavell was transferred from the 19th (Western) Division to the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, where he took command of the 126th Machine Gun Company; one of the officers in the company was his future commanding officer, Lieutenant (later general) Richard Nelson Gale.Gale, p. 39 On 21 March the Germans launched Operation Michael, a major offensive against the British Army, and the 42nd Division moved into the frontline near Bapaume, replacing the 46th (North Midland) Division who had taken heavy casualties.Gale, pp. 40‚Äì41 The offensive was repulsed, and by the end of August the division had advanced towards the Hindenburg Line.Gale, pp. 46‚Äì47 Forming a part of the British Third Army, the division then made rapid advances towards Bapaume and by the end of September had reached the Hindenburg Line; on 27 September Flavell's brigade, the 126th (East Lancashire), was tasked with capturing Highland Ridge, near Havrincourt Wood.Gale, pp. 48‚Äì49 The next day, after the brigade had reached the top of the ridge, Gale's machine gun section sighted in on two German field guns moving parallel to their position; they sighted in on the horses leading the guns, but just before they could open fire, Flavell arrived. According to Gale, \\"Flavell could not resist and, firing one of the guns himself, he brought down the leading horses;\\" the crews fled and the section was able to capture the two guns.Gale, pp. 50‚Äì51 This action resulted in Flavell being awarded his third Military Cross (second bar). Second World War During the interwar period Flavell remained on the active list of the East Surrey Regiment, but became involved in the shipping industry with a business partner from the United States. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, Flavell was recalled to the British Army and subsequently given command of the 2/7th Middlesex Regiment. He saw service during the Battle of France in 1940, and was then given the task of raising the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion. On 22 June 1940, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, created the British airborne establishment when he directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p. 21 In 1941 the 1st Parachute Brigade was formed, with Brigadier Richard N. Gale, Flavell's former commanding officer, as its commander.Gale, p. 115 Gale selected Flavell, now a colonel,Frost, p. 23 to raise and then command the 2nd Parachute Battalion which would form part of the brigade. His adjutant was Captain John D. Frost, who would later become famous for commanding the battalion during the Battle of Arnhem; both men qualified as parachutists in October 1941.Frost, pp. 30‚Äì31 In January 1942 Flavell gave Frost command over Operation Biting, a raid on a radar station on the French coast near Bruneval; the raid, which took place in February, was successful and brought back vital technology. In the spring of 1942 Gale was promoted to Deputy Director of Staff Duties at the War Office,Dover, p. 105 and he passed command of the brigade over to Flavell.Gale, p. 122 Flavell, promoted to brigadier, transferred command of 2nd Parachute Battalion to Major Gofton-Salmond,Saunders, p. 72 and in the beginning of November the brigade was sent to North Africa as part of Operation Torch.Otway, p. 62 Because of a shortage of aircraft, the 3rd Parachute Battalion was forced to travel separately from the brigade, arriving on 11 November;Thompson, p. 57 the rest of the brigade, including Flavell, arrived the next day.Otway, p. 75 He commanded the brigade for the whole of the period that it fought in North Africa, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order at the end of the brigade's service in the theatre; the citation stated that Flavell and the brigade had \\"fought magnificently and set a standard to the 1st Army difficult to emulate.\\" Under his command the brigade had sustained 1,700 casualties and taken more than 3,500 Axis prisoners,Thompson, p. 90 as well as winning eight Distinguished Service Orders, fifteen Military Crosses, nine Distinguished Conduct Medals and twenty-two Military Medals. Flavell had a difficult time commanding the brigade while it was in North Africa. He was hampered by the fact that there were no senior officers who knew how to use airborne forces properly and efficiently, meaning that the airborne missions that were given to the brigade were often unsuitable to its abilities.Frost, p. 171Otway, p. 81 The same problems occurred when it was used in a ground role, for which it was considered to be unsuited, and Flavell found it difficult to prevent this occurring.Otway, pp. 88‚Äì89 The brigade ended its operations in North Africa in mid-April 1943, and Flavell left for England in June to take up a new command. He was replaced as commander of 1st Parachute Brigade by Brigadier Gerald W. Lathbury.Otway, pp. 87‚Äì88 He became commander, Airborne Establishments, which was tasked with promoting closer cooperation with the Royal Air Force as well as providing reinforcements for the 1st Airborne Division and aiding in the creation of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Then on 12 June 1944, he was given command of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, part of the 6th Airborne Division, commanded by Major-General Richard N. Gale. On the night of 5 June the division conducted Operation Tonga, the British airborne portion of the Allied invasion of Normandy. As an airlanding brigade equipped with gliders, the brigade was the last unit belonging to the division to arrive, landing at 21:00 on 6 June in landing zone 'W' after it had been secured by the rest of the division.Otway, pp. 181‚Äì182 Flavell continued to command the 6th Airlanding Brigade throughout the period that 6th Airborne Division fought in Normandy, as well as when the division fought in the Ardennes forest during the German offensive there in December 1944. He was involved with \\"Operation Market Garden\\" at Arnhem where his son, James, also fought and another son was involved towing the gliders for troop landings. He was then appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff HQ in First Allied Airborne Army, and subsequently made an Officer of the American Legion of Merit. Postwar career In the 1945 general election, Flavell stood as the Conservative candidate for North-West Hendon in London, but was defeated by a slim margin. After this, he became involved in property development and also managing his own company. In 1948 he was appointed as Deputy Lieutenant for Middlesex, and some time later became the chairman of the County of Middlesex Territorial Army Association.

The larger bone is the cleithrum. The cleithrum is a membrane bone which first appears as part of the skeleton in primitive bony fish, where it runs vertically along the scapula. Its name is derived from Greek Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπŒ∏œÅŒøŒΩ = \\"key (lock)\\", by analogy with \\"clavicle\\" from Latin clavicula = \\"little key\\". In modern fishes, the cleithrum is a large bone that extends upwards from the base of the pectoral fin and anchors to the cranium above the gills, forming the posterior edge of the gill chamber. The bone has scientific use as a means to determine the age of fishes. The lobe-finned fishes share this arrangement.

Claudius and Andrew of the Burgundians (, ) is a Roman Catholic church dedicated to Saint Claudius of Besan√ßon and the apostle Saint Andrew. It is one of the national churches in Rome dedicated to France (Free County of Burgundy). Built from 1728 to 1730, the church was designed by French architect Antoine D√©rizet.  History  Burgundians, mostly bankers and merchants, were present in Rome since the 15th century. Following the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) and the annexation by the Kingdom of France of the Free County of Burgundy (previously ruled by the Holy Roman Empire and today's Franche-Comt√©), the community grew up to twelve thousand people. In 1652 founded a national brotherhood and bought an oratory near the present Place of San Silvestro. In 1662, a hospice for pilgrims was opened near the church. Pope Innocent XI proclaimed the oratory national church of the Burgundians. In 1726 the old church was demolished. In June 1728 started the construction of the new building designed by Antoine D√©rizet. The church was consecrated in 1731 and dedicated to Saint Claudius of Besan√ßon and Saint Andrew the Apostle. Since 1866, the fathers of Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament officiate in the Church, holding the perpetual adoration of the Eucharist.  Interior  The plan of the church is a Greek cross, with a hemispherical dome; pendentives are decorated with stuccoes of the Four Evangelists, while the four arches supporting the dome are decorated with stuccoes of angels and allegories of the Passion, Hope and Faith. Above the main altar, a fresco of Antonio Bicchi depicts the Lord blessing. On the left side chapel is the polychrome marble urn, work of Corrado Mezzana, containing the relics of Peter Julian Eymard, founder of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. The altar is decorated with a painting by Placido Costanzi which depicts a vision of St. Charles Borromeo (1731). The side chapel on the right is dedicated to St. Joseph and is decorated with modern works of Cleto Luzi (1949), \\"Dream of St. Joseph\\" and \\"the Flight into Egypt\\". On the altar stands a sculpture representing St. Joseph between two angels made by Guido Francisci.  Exterior  The fa√ßade is decorated with two large statues of Saint Andrew by Luc Breton and Saint Claudius of Besan√ßon by Guillaume Antoine Grandjacquet, made in 1771.

Life and career B P Radhakrishna was born on 30 April 1918 at Bangalore, as the third son of Sri Bangalore Puttaiya, a well-known public figure of Mysore State. BPR graduated from the Central College, Bangalore in the year 1937 obtaining BSc (Hons) degree in geology in First Class and securing a gold medal. Soon after graduation, he joined the Mysore Geological Department (MGD) as a field assistant at the young age of 19. BPR served the Department for 37 years and retired from service in 1974. His tenure of office as Director of the Department saw a great expansion in activities, especially in mineral resource development and the utilisation of groundwater resources of the State. BPR will be remembered for his service to the cause of geology in India. Besides being a core member of the group that conceived the idea of forming the Geological Society of India in 1958 for \\"improvement in the standard of geological research, by providing a forum for free exchange of ideas and media for quick publications of results and wide dissemination of knowledge\\", he served as the first Secretary for fifteen years and later as the Editor between 1974‚Äì92. The Society under his fostering care has developed and continues to flourish. The Journal which was issued once a year became a monthly. Apart from maintaining high standards for the Journal, a series of other publications, Memoirs, Lecture Notes, Field Guide Books, Mineral Resource Series and Text Books of Geology and Mineral Resources of individual States have been brought out. BPR always paid attention to the organisation of Symposia, Group Discussions and Field Workshops. For the past few years the Annual Meetings of the society are being held at different centres in the country to emphasise the national character of the Society and also to spot promising young talent and encourage its development. The publications of the Society have exercised a beneficial influence on the growth of Earth Science Studies in India. The Society has grown in stature and has nearly 2000 members on its roll. BPR's deep involvement and selfless service are central to the Society. BPR always encouraged multi-disciplinary efforts to study geological problems. The distinguishing character of his approach was his remarkable independence, he was reluctant to seek governmental support for the Society. On the contrary, he firmly believed in personal commitment involving the intellectual labour of its fellows rather than financial contributions.

Douglas; Elies, Mark. Pok√©mon Trainer's Guide. Sandwich Islands Publishing, 1999. . (pg 192‚Äì195) Its Japanese name, Fushigidane (fu-SHI-gi-DON-e), is a combination of the Japanese words for and . In translating the game for English speaking audiences, Nintendo gave the Pok√©mon \\"cleverly descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children; thus Bulbasaur, relating to both its dinosaur appearance (saur) and the large garlic-shaped bulb on its back (bulb or bulba). The idea to feature Bulbasaur and the other Red and Blue starters in a significant role in Pok√©mon X and Y came about a year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pok√©mon's final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these Pok√©mon from Professor Sycamore, the games professor, to see their Mega Evolved form. Characteristics Despite their English names, Ken Sugimori confirmed that the design of Bulbasaur and its evolutions is based on onions and frogs, albeit identified more with a smaller Dicynodont. In the Pok√©mon franchise, Bulbasaur are small, squat amphibian and plant Pok√©mon that move on all four legs, and have light blue-green bodies with darker blue-green spots. As a Bulbasaur undergoes evolution into Ivysaur and then later into Venusaur, the bulb on its back blossoms into a large flower. The seed on a Bulbasaur's back is planted at birth and then sprouts and grows larger as the Bulbasaur grows. The bulb absorbs sunlight which allows it grow. For this reason, Bulbasaur enjoy soaking up the sun's rays, and can survive for days without eating because the bulb stores energy. The distinctive differences of Bulbasaur from other Pok√©mon such as Diglett are well understood by children and so motivate their play and trading of the creature. Appearances In the video games Pok√©mon Red against a rival Charmander Bulbasaur made its video game debut on February 27, 1996, in the Japanese-language games Pocket Monsters Red and Green. Along with Charmander and Squirtle, Bulbasaur is a starter Pok√©mon the player can choose from at the beginning of the games. Bulbasaur's dual typing of Grass and Poison type is in contrast to Charmander's Fire type and Squirtle's Water type. Bulbasaur is the only starter in Red, Blue, and Green that has a dual typing. Bulbasaur and the other starters from Red and Blue are replaced by Pikachu in Pok√©mon Yellow, the only starter available in it. Instead, they are obtained throughout the game from several trainers. In Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen, remakes of Red and Blue, Bulbasaur is selectable as a starter Pok√©mon once again, along with Charmander and Squirtle. In Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, after obtaining all sixteen badges and defeating Red, the player can choose to obtain either Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle. In Pok√©mon X and Y, players can also choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle near the start of the game shortly after having chosen the games' new starter Pok√©mon. The Nintendo 64 spin-off Pok√©mon Stadium, and other spin-offs such as Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon, give the player a choice of a Bulbasaur (among fifteen other Pok√©mon), and in Pok√©mon Snap, Bulbasaur are one of the Pok√©mon that the player can photograph.

Written for children 10 and up, it portrays Tituba as a black West Indian woman who tells stories about life in Barbados to the village girls. These stories are mingled with existing superstitions and half-remembered pagan beliefs on the part of Puritans, and the witchcraft hysteria is partly attributed to a sort of cabin fever during a particularly bitter winter.

The poem is divided into twelve \\"books\\" with irregular stanza structures and unrhymed lines of poetry. The story describes how a group of sorcerers work to destroy the Hodeirah family in an attempt to prevent a prophecy of their future doom from coming true. However, a young child named Thalaba is able to escape from the slaughter. After one of the sorcerers hunts down Thalaba to kill him, the sorcerer is defeated by a great storm and his powerful magical ring comes into Thalaba's possession. With the ring, Thalaba travels across the Middle East to find a way to defeat the evil sorcerers. In the end, Thalaba is able to stay true to Allah and is guided by the prophet Mohammad in destroying the sorcerers. Southey uses the poem to describe various superstitions and myths, with a heavy reliance on repetition of various themes that link the myths together. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the strong morality within the work or the quality of the poetry. However, other critics felt that the lack of a strong lyrical structure and the use of Middle Eastern myths detracted from the poem. Background The basis for Southey wishing to write long poems came from his private reading of literature while attending Westminster School as a boy. In Summer 1799, Southey completed writing Madoc and began working on Thalaba. He started to work with Coleridge, and both Coleridge's \\"Kubla Khan\\" and Thalaba shared many sources. He then travelled to Burton where he continued to write the poem, which he called a romance at the time.Spech 2006 pp. 17, 79‚Äì80 He soon after travelled to Portugal in April 1800 where he planned to finish Thalaba and send it back to England for publication. By July, he was able to complete the poem and in October the poem was edited and ready for publication. John Rickman served as Southey's agent in selling the book. Although finished, Southey continued to work on fixing the end of the poem until January 1801 after receiving suggestions from his friends. After Portugal went to war with France and Spain, Southey left the country and he returned to England in June 1801.Spech 2006 pp. 83‚Äì84, 86 The poem was published in 1801 by Longman with 1,000 copies, but only sold half by 1804. A revised edition was published in 1809.Madden 1972 p. 63 Poem The poem is a twelve-book work with irregular stanzas and lines that are not rhymed. The poem deals with Harun al-Rashid and a group of sorcerers at Domdaniel that live under the sea. It was foretold that Thalaba, a Muslim, would be God's champion and conquer the sorcerers. To pre-empt the prophecy, the sorcerers kill the Hodeirah family. Unknown to them, Thalaba was able to escape from harm with his mother Zeinab. They flee through the desert and arrive at Irem, a ruined city. After Zeinab dies, Thalaba is raised by a leader of Irem named Moath. The sorcerers find out that Thalaba is still alive, and Abdaldar, one of their members, goes to find out Thalaba's location. When Abdaldar arrives, he is stopped a simoom, a sand storm, and his magic ring is lost. Thalaba finds the ring, which grants him great power.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 85‚Äì86 A demon comes to steal the ring from Thalaba, but he is stopped by the young boy. This allows Thalaba to demand information about the sorcerers and why his family was killed. Time passes and Thalaba settles into a pastoral life at Irem and plans to marry Moath's daughter, Oneiza. However, Thalaba decides that his duty prohibits him from such actions, and he leaves to fulfill his destiny. However, the sorcerer Lobaba tricks Thalaba and tries to steal the ring. After many failed attempts, Lobaba tries to convince Thalaba to harness the ring's magic power, which would bring Thalaba harm. Instead, Thalaba argues against the use of magic in general and realises that Lobaba is evil. Although Thalaba attempts to kill Lobaba and fails by the sorcerer's magic, a storm comes and destroys the sorcerer.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 86‚Äì87 Thalaba travels past Baghdad onto the ruins of Babylon to find Haruth and Maruth, two angels that know about magic. While searching for them, he runs across Mohareb, an evil warrior. Mohareb offers to take Thalaba through the city and they travel through the cave of Zohak. Zohak, an individual punished to have snakes constantly eat at his brain, tries to stop them before Mohareb distracts him. The two continue to travel into the dwelling of Haruth and Maruth and, when Mohareb finds out that Thalaba is not evil, attacks him. However, the ring protects Thalaba. After Mohareb claims that magic was the only reason why Thalaba lives, Thalaba decides to get rid of the ring into a pit before the two resume fighting. Soon after, Mohareb is also thrown into the pit and Thalaba is able to ask the angels what he needs to defeat his enemies. He is simply told \\"faith\\".Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 87‚Äì88 Thalaba travels to the land of Aloadin, who owns a great garden paradise, and he is invited to feast with the people, but he is unwilling to imbibe alcohol or be taken in by the dancing women that seek to entice him. The temptations overwhelm him to the point where he can no longer tolerate them and he flees. Shortly after leaving, he discovers one of the women being attacked by a man wanting to have his way with her. It is revealed that the woman was Oneiza, who was captured, and that Aloadin was a sorcerer. After saving Oneiza, Thalaba is determined to stop the sorcerer and he ends up killing him. Following this, they are praised by a Sultan that Aloadin wanted to kill, and Thalaba decides to marry Oneiza. Before they can finish their marriage, she dies and Thalaba is left to mourn over her grave. While mourning, a spirit that appears to be Oneiza begins to haunt Thalaba and claim that God disapproves of the young warrior. However, Moath comes and is able to recognise the spirit as a vampire. After killing the vampire, the real Oneiza comes to guide Thalaba onwards.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 87‚Äì89 Thalaba travels to look for Simorg, the Bird of Ages, on the mountain Kaf. While wandering, he meets an old woman, Maimuna, who is a sorceress. She casts a spell upon him and he is sent to the land of Mohareb, by now an evil Sultan. However, Maimuna's sister, Khawla, knows that if Thalaba is killed that Mohareb would also be killed and she seeks to kill Thalaba to remove Mohareb. Finding this out, Mohareb joins with Thalaba and returns the ring. After telling Thalaba to turn to the darker powers, Thalaba leaves. Khawla attempts to user her magic to kill Thalaba, but the ring protects him. When Maimuna tries to user her own magic against Thalaba, she witnesses the goodness of the universe and represents her evil ways. She repays him by using her magic to bring him back to the mountain, and Thalaba is able to return to his search for Simorg. After wandering through snow, Thalaba comes across the Font of Fire with the sleeping Laila trapped inside. It turns out she was placed there by her father, the sorcerer Okba and one of the murderers of Thalaba's family.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 89‚Äì90 Okba, old and worn out, comes and asks Thalaba to simply kill him and end his misery. However, Thalaba denies the request. The angel of death, Azrael, tells Thalaba that either Okba or Laila must die. Okba uses this chance to try and stab Thalaba, but Laila steps in between them and is killed. Okba curses God for his fate but Thalaba can only feel pity over the scene. After leaving, he is able to come to Simorg's valley. Simorg directs Thalaba to take a sled to continue on his way while the spirit of Laila asks Thalaba to end Okba's misery. However, Thalaba refuses to commit vengeance and he travels onwards until he arrives at a small boat waiting for him. He is taken down a river to the sea where Thalaba tosses away his magic ring. He is then taken to a cave that would lead him to the domain of the sorcerers.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 90‚Äì91 Thalaba travels down into the cave and meets the warrior Othatha chained to rocks. Thalaba frees Othatha before travelling further until he meets an Efreet that guards a gate to the Domdaniel. After shooting an arrow into an eye of the Efreet, he is able to proceed forward where he meets Khawla and Mohareb. He is able to knock them away from him and quickly moves forward to find the powerful sword of his father. The sword of flames covers Thalaba in flames which causes the area to be filled with light. This scares the sorcerers who then try to attack him. After Thalaba defeats Mohareb and the sorcerers, the voice of Mohammad asks Thalaba what he wishes. Thalaba simply gives his will up to the Prophet before destroying an evil idol, which destroys the cave.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 91 Themes The story depicts how suffering is essential to completing one's destiny. Southey's purpose in Thalaba, however, is to describe as many of the various myths and superstitions that he can, and this interferes with the resolving of moral problems within the story. Instead, the moral lessons are formulaic and the events focus on awards given to those who are obedient. Southey's emphasis on the actual mythic incidents over the moral events are backed up with more than 80 pages of his own notes that describe the various references to traditional myths or mythic creatures that are incorporated into the story. In terms of structure, the unilateral plot keeps Thalaba does not allow for an easy flow into various mythic incidents. Instances of the plot being supplanted by the myths can be found during the descriptions of the story of Irem, Haruth and Maruth, or others.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 89‚Äì92 There is reliance on repetition of themes within the plot of Thalaba. Three times he attained a paradise that turns out to be false, and this is followed by the death of a woman who are gone until the very end when Thalaba is awarded entrance into a true paradise. The seeking out of mythic figures to guide him onto the next part of the tale is equally repetitive and has little result for the plot. Various instances of the sorcerers and sorceresses are added to the story to emphasise the evil of magic along with tempting Thalaba with power. However, the emphasis on magic hides the moral within Thalaba's temptations. Although Thalaba does achieve his goal through moral submission, many of the quests and actions are arbitrary and repetitive. As such, they take away from any Islamic truth that could be found within the actions.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 92‚Äì93 Other images, such as Thalaba reclaiming his father's magic sword, are symbols that effectively reinforce Southey's moral themes. However, these events represent the minority of the plot and are rarely relied on early in the story. To the contrary, the heavily represented magic ring is used to protect Thalaba with little explanation as to how it works and there is no moral statements tied to its use. As a whole, the poem is able to portray scenery and events in strongly descriptive manners, but the manner in doing this takes away from their meaning and effect. In terms of the divine there is a dual entity: Allah representing preservation and Eblis representing destruction. However, evil, though an opposite to good, is never explained but merely used to further the plot.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 93‚Äì94 Critical response Cardinal Newman, supporter of Thalaba Ernest Bernhard-Kabisch pointed out that \\"Few readers have been as enthusiastic about it as Cardinal Newman who considered it the most 'morally sublime' of English poems. But the young Shelley reckoned it his favorite poem, and both he and Keats followed its lead in some of their verse narratives.\\"Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 84‚Äì85 An anonymous review in the September 1801 British Critic claimed, \\"A more complete monument of vile and depraved taste no man ever raised [...] He has, therefore, given a rhapsody of Twelve Books in a sort of irregular lyric, so unlike verse or sense, that if it were worth while to present our readers with a tissue of so coarse a texture, we could fill whole pages with specimens of its absurdity. We will have mercy, and give only a single example, which may be taken at random, for no part seems to be better than the rest.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 63 This was followed by an October 1801 anonymous review in the Monthly Mirror that argued, \\"It is a matter to be lamented, that, in times like the present, a work of letters can rarely be reviewed upon the ground of its own proper merits ... In the consideration of this romance, the judicious critic cannot but feel that one rule of good writing has been studiously observed. His work will not incur the censure passed by the late Mr. Collins upon his Persian Eclogues, namely, that, from erroneous manners, they were 'Irish.'\\"Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 64‚Äì65 The review continued, \\"He tells us it is metrical ... He will excuse our ears, but we cannot agree with him. Among the sins of our youth, we, like him, have traded in desultory versification, but have long been brought back to lyrical rhyme, and heroic blank verse. The reasons are obvious ... We recommend his beauties to the esteem, and his faults to the forgetfulness, of every reader. Upon the whole, he has our thanks for much amusement, and some information.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 65‚Äì66 An anonymous review in the January 1802 Monthly Magazine stated, \\"The fable or story of Thalaba is perhaps too marvellous: every incident is a miracle; every utensil, an amulet; every speech, a spell; every personage, a god; or rather a talismanic statue; of which destiny and magic overrule the movements, not human hopes and fears‚Äînot human desires and passions, which always must excite the vivid sympathy of men. It offers, however, scope beyond other metrical romances, for a splendid variety of description\\".Madden 1972 qtd. p. 67 The review continued, \\"Whatever loss of interest this poem may sustain, as a whole, by an apparent driftlessness of the events and characters, is compensated by the busy variety, the picturesque imagery, and striking originality of the parts.\\" British Romantic poets as a whole Later in 1802, Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, submitted a review on Thalaba. In the October 1802 edition, he claimed that Southey \\"belongs to a sect of poets, that has established itself in this country within these ten or twelve years, and is looked upon, we believe, as one of its chief champions and apostles ... As Mr Southey is the first author, of this persuasion, that has yet been brought before us for judgment, we cannot discharge our inquisitorial office conscientiously, without premising a few words upon the nature and tendency of the tenets he has helped to promulgate. The disciples of this school boast much of its originality.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 68‚Äì69 This led to a discussion of Southey's flaws: \\"Originality, however, we are persuaded, is rarer than mere alteration ... That our new poets have abandoned the old models, may certainly be admitted; but we have not been able to discover that they have yet created any models of their own.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 69 He continued to discuss the flaws of the British Romantic poets before returning to Thalaba when he argued, \\"The subject of this poem is almost as ill chosen as the diction; and the conduct of the fable as disorderly as the versification ... From this little sketch of the story, our readers will easily perceive, that it consists altogether of the most wild and extravagant fictions, and openly sets nature and probability at defiance. In its action it is not an imitation of anything; and excludes all rational criticism, as to the choice and succession of its incidents.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 80‚Äì81 This was followed by a December 1803 review in The Critical Review by William Taylor that said, > Perhaps no work of art so imperfect ever announced such power in the > artist‚Äîperhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a > production‚Äîas Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might have > called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by > implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive > pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive ... but the personages, like the > figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they > appear as the episodical or accessory objects.Madden 1972 qtd. p. 91 The review continued, \\"The style of Thalaba has a plasticity and variety, of which epic poetry offers no other example. The favourite formulas of every school of diction have been acquired, and are employed ... This stunning impression of the style gives pain, we believe, especially to mere English scholars, and to those whose comparison of art is narrow and confined, but falls within the limits of pleasure, and is even a cause of luxurious stimulation, to readers of a wider range and a more tolerant taste.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 94 In 1977, Bernhardt-Kabisch claimed that the poem was \\"probably the most influential and historically the most important of Southey's long poems\\" and \\"What made Thalaba distinctive as well as provocative was above all its flamboyant exoticism.\\"Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 84, 85 However, he pointed out that \\"The chief weakness is the diffuse and tortuous plot which eddies and meanders without any firm principle of progression as the hero posts from stage to mysterious stage.\\"Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 92 Sir Granville Bantock authored \\"Thalaba the Destroyer ‚Äì Symphonic Poem\\" (1899) based on the poem.Granville Bantock ‚Äì Thalaba the Destroyer (1/2)Granville Bantock ‚Äì Thalaba the Destroyer (2/2) Notes References * Bernhardt- Kabisch, Ernest.

Smith where he met engineer Oliver Weldon who gave him details of the location of coal deposits in the Cross Roads area of Indian Territory (now the McAlester area of Oklahoma). In 1866 he went to the Choctaw Nation and worked as a trader to the Indians. On August 22, 1872, he married Rebecca Burney (born 1841 in Mississippi - died May 5, 1919, in Oklahoma) a member of the Chickasaw Nation. This made it possible for him to gain citizenship in and the right to own property in both the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations. Using the knowledge he had gotten from Weldon, he was able to make many lucrative coal claims in the area and to establish what eventually became McAlester Coal Mining Co. His trading company, J. J.

Jean de La For√™t, also Jean de La Forest or Jehan de la Forest (died 1537) was the first official French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, serving from 1534 to 1537.Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453-1923 by Charles A. Frazee p.27 Antonio Rincon had preceded him as an envoy to the Ottoman Empire from 1530 to 1533. When Jean de La For√™t died in Constantinople in 1537, he was succeeded by Antonio Rincon as official Ambassador. 1534 embassy to the Ottoman Empire Jean de La For√™t negotiated with Hayreddin Barbarossa in 1534. Jean de La For√™t departed together with the returning Ottoman embassy to France. On his way to Constantinople, Jean de La For√™t first landed in north Africa, where he offered Hayreddin Barbarossa fifty ships and supplies in exchange for help against Genoa.Francis I R. J. Knecht p.274 He also asked Hayreddin to raid the coasts of Spain \\"with all manner of war\\". Jean de La For√™t arrived in the Ottoman capital in May 1534, accompanied by his cousin Charles de Marillac and the scholar Guillaume Postel,Garnier, p.91 and endeavored to exert French influence on Ottoman affairs. He accompanied Suleiman to Azerbaijan in the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War against Persia, until they finally returned together to Constantinople in early 1536.Suleiman the Magnificent 1520-1566 by Roger Bigelow Merriman p.142 Jean de La For√™t was directed to seek trading privileges, as well as religious arrangements and military agreements between France and the Ottoman Empire. De La For√™t had also been instructed by Francis I to obtain \\"a million of gold, which will be no inconvenience to the Grand Signior\\".Suleiman the Magnificent ‚Äî Sultan of the East by Harold Lamb p.180 In exchange, Francis I proposed in his instructions to La For√™t: an ambassador, a perpetual treaty of alliance, trade and a promise \\"to hold all Christianity quiet, without war undertaken against him... in a universal peace\\", by weakening Charles V \\"until he can no more resist\\". Jean de la Foret also had secret military instructions to organize a combined offensive on Italy in 1535:Garnier, p.92 Through the negotiations of de La For√™t with the vizir Ibrahim Pasha it was agreed that combined military operations against Italy would take place, in which France would attack Lombardy while the Ottoman Empire would attack from Naples.Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453-1923 by Charles A. Frazee p.28 1536 Franco-Turkish treaty Letter of Suleiman to Francis I in 1536, informing Francis I of the successful campaign of Iraq, and acknowledging the permanent French embassy of Jean de La Forest at the Ottoman court. In February 1536, de la For√™t obtained the signature of a commercial treaty called Capitulations (of which only a draft has been recovered), which was the foundation for French influence in the Ottoman Empire and the Levant until the 19th century.Renaissance diplomacy Garrett Mattingly p.154 Suleiman seemingly had some doubts about French commitment, expressing: \\"How can I have trust in him? He has always promised more than he can carry out\\", referring to the lack of French commitment in 1534‚Äì35, when Tunis was finally recaptured by Charles V, but he nevertheless agreed to the alliance upon Francis I's invasion of Piedmont in early 1536.Suleiman the Magnificent ‚Äî Sultan of the East by Harold Lamb p.182 The 1536 Franco-Turkish treaty allowed the French in the Ottoman Empire to be judged by their own laws, in a French Consular court (a status the Venetians had already been granted), exemption from the usual taxes and dues levied upon non-Muslim foreigners, and trading concessions. This treaty offered guaranties (especially extraterritoriality) that would become the model for future \\"unequal treaties\\" between European and Asian powers.Renaissance diplomacy by Garrett Mattingly p.155 By this agreement, French law courts, churches and valuables would all remain extraterritorial in the Ottoman Empire. In a sense, French possessions in the Ottoman Empire would become the first foreign possessions of the French Crown, effectively a Crown Colony of France. The French protectorate also extended to the Holy Places of Jerusalem.Suleiman the Magnificent ‚Äî Sultan of the East by Harold Lamb p.183 By 1620, one third of France's foreign trade was done with the Ottoman Empire.Who owns antiquity?: museums and the battle over our ancient heritage James B. Cuno p.70 The commercial treaty actually was something of a fa√ßade for Jean de La For√™t, whose main role was actually to coordinate military collaboration between France and the Ottoman Empire. The commercial treaty however would become prominent from the second half of the 16th century. Once the treaty with the Turks was secured, Francis I invaded Savoy in 1536, starting the Italian War of 1536‚Äì1538. A Franco-Turkish fleet was stationed in Marseille by the end of 1536, threatening Genoa.The Cambridge Modern History Sir Adolphus William Ward p.72 In 1537 Hayreddin Barbarossa raided the Italian coast and laid siege to Corfu, although this provided only limited assistance to the French. With Charles V unsuccessful in battle and squeezed between the French invaders and the Ottomans, Francis I and Charles V ultimately made peace at the Truce of Nice, 18 June 1538.The Cambridge modern history Sir Adolphus William Ward p.73 La For√™t died at Constantinople in the following year. Charles V would turn his efforts against the Ottomans, only to lose the Battle of Preveza on 28 September 1538. The vizier died soon after the treaty was made in 1536, and there is doubt whether the treaty was formally ratified at this point, since only an archived draft has been found. The treaty of alliance between France and the Ottoman Empire would eventually be ratified later in 1569 through ambassador Claude du Bourg.The Cambridge History of Turkey: the later Ottoman Empire, 1603-1839 Suraiya Faroqhi p.290 Suleiman nevertheless respected the content of the agreement, and launched his armies, awaiting for the French offensive. Scientific mission Jean de La For√™t was accompanied on his embassy by the French linguist and writer Guillaume Postel,Gender, Kabbalah, and the Reformation by Yvonne Petry p.31 who led the scientific research of the mission, and made an extremely positive account of the Ottoman civilization and its educational, judicial and welfare systems in his De Orbis terrae concordia libri quattuor.Socinianism and Arminianism by Martin Mulsow,Jan Rohls p.154 See also *Franco-Ottoman alliance *France-Asia relations References Sources  Garnier, Edith L'Alliance Impie Editions du Felin, 2008, Paris Interview Category:Ambassadors of France to the Ottoman Empire Category:1537 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:16th-century French diplomats Category:16th-century French people Category:1536 in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Jean de La For√™t"},{"id":"24471753","text":"Hana Mandl√≠kov√° was the defending champion but did not compete that year.

Proksch enrolled in the Kaiser Infantry Regiment No. 1 of the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1910 and then the Railway Academy in Linz in 1912 before taking a job with the government railways. He returned to the army in 1914 with the Infantry Regiment No. 91 and saw action during the First World War in Poland and Russia.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 305 He first became involved in politics in 1912 when he joined the German Workers' Party and worked on behalf of the party in Silesia and Moravia. After his war service Proksch settled in the now much smaller Austria and returned to politics by rejoining the renamed Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 306 Proksch met Adolf Hitler as early as 1919 and became a loyal follower of the German from then on. Proksch launched the Nazis in Linz in Upper Austria the same year. He also founded both the party newspaper Linzer Volksstimme (1923) and the NSP-Verlag publishing house (1926). In 1922, Proksch began to team up with the Passau National Socialists to fight against leftists in Linz. Later, he was a featured speaker in Passau and other towns in Lower Bavaria.Anna Rosmus: Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 38f He also served on the Linz City Council as the chairman of the Nazi faction from July 1923 to January 1932. On 29 August 1926 Hitler appointed Proksch Gauleiter for Upper Austria, and he served in this post until June 1927. In 1928 he was made Deputy Landesleiter (State Leader) for all of Austria. Then on 6 June 1931 he was promoted to Landesleiter and held the post until 23 June 1933, although most power rested with Hitler's personal representative, the German Theodor Habicht. However, Proksch did have strong influence over finances and he was credited with eliminating the 30,000 schillings of debt that the party found itself in.F. Parkinson, Conquering the past: Austrian Nazism yesterday & today, Wayne State University Press, 1989, p. 37 He fled to Germany on 24 June 1933 following the banning of the Nazi Party in Austria. He settled in Munich where he was made Deputy to Habicht who continued to be responsible for Austrian policy. Proksch returned to Austria in time to take part in the coup attempt that resulted in the killing of Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934. In July 1934 he was granted the title of Honorary Gauleiter. Returning to Germany, he acquired German citizenship in 1935. In March 1936, he was elected to the Reichstag for electoral constituency 34, Hamburg, and in April 1938 he switched to representing district 8, Liegnitz. Given Proksch's position as a Hitler loyalist, his profile was raised following the Anschluss. Joining the Sturmabteilung (SA) as an SA- Gruppenf√ºhrer in June 1938, he was promoted to SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer on 20 April 1943. In 1940 he was made the Reich Trustee of Labor for Vienna and Lower Austria. He then served as President of the Labor Office in Vienna from 1943 to 1945.

Though their roots can be traced back to the earliest appearances of the Star Sapphire queens, they have entered into a significant plot role as part of the 2009‚Äì2010 Blackest Night crossover event.Green Lantern vol. 4 #25 (December 2007) First formed by the Zamarons at the conclusion of the Mystery of the Star Sapphire storyline running in Green Lantern vol. 4, issues #18‚Äì20 (May‚ÄìJuly 2007), their abilities come from violet power rings which wield the power of love. At present, members of the Star Sapphires have only been depicted as being females. During the Blackest Night panel at Comic Con International 2009, Geoff Johns explained that: \\"anyone can join, but most men are not worthy.\\"CCI LIVE: Green Lantern Blackest Night Panel, Comic Book Resources, July 26, 2009 Group history The Star Sapphires are first mentioned in the context of a group during a conversation between Carol Ferris and Hal Jordan immediately after Ferris has just recovered from having been possessed by the Star Sapphire stone during Mystery of the Star Sapphire. Ferris explains that while under the possession of the stone, she learned a number of things about its history and capabilities. She says that it told her that billions of years ago, when the Guardians of the Universe decided to form the Green Lantern Corps, a tribe of women left Oa because they did not agree with the Guardians' belief in living a life without emotion. They said they would continue on their own existence living with emotions, starting with love. They searched the universe for billions of years for the thing the Guardians feared, and eventually found it on a planet called Zamaron. They learned of love from the first Star Sapphire gem, which was discovered locked between the embrace of two crystallized skeletons inside a cave. She explains to him that despite the fact that he had been able to defeat the various incarnations of the Star Sapphire he'd encountered up until then, other Green Lanterns had not been as fortunate. She describes another Star Sapphire falling in love with a Green Lantern and encasing his world in violet crystal so that the two could be together forever. She also mentions that the Star Sapphire gem is like the green power rings used by Green Lanterns and the yellow power rings used by Sinestro Corps members.Green Lantern vol. 4 #19 (June 2007) After this exchange, Jillian \\"Cowgirl\\" Pearlman (being possessed by the Star Sapphire) attacks the two. Jordan uses his ring to grant Ferris enhanced abilities needed to help fight Cowgirl. The two fight with the Star Sapphire and she is defeated by their combined efforts. An energy vortex opens in the room and a voice is shown as saying that \\"a new Corps is rising and so must ours.\\" Four Zamarons step out of the portal, and one announces that both Cowgirl and Ferris will become the first two members of their Corps. Jordan tells Ferris to attempt to remove the Star Sapphire from Cowgirl while he confronts the Zamarons. Though she is able to do so, the stone immobilizes the two Earth women while the Zamarons gain the upper hand over Jordan. The stone asks Jordan which of the two women he desires most, and that the woman he chooses will be able to be with him forever. In response, Jordan kisses one of the Zamarons, convincing the stone to release its hostages (Cowgirl and Carol Ferris), and possess her instead. The stone reacts with its new host violently, prompting the Zamarons to retreat with her to their home planet to remove the star from their ally and discuss the gem's future.Green Lantern vol. 4 #20 (July 2007) At the end of the final issue in the storyline, the Zamarons are shown to have removed the Star Sapphire from their sister-in-arms at the cost of her life. The Zamarons agree that Jordan was right in showing how the Star Sapphire's power is too overwhelming to one host. The farther from the center of the emotional spectrum, the greater the influence a powered light has over its bearer (a plot element which would again become significant at the opposite end of the spectrum with the Red Lanterns). The Zamarons claim they could rectify the problem by taking a page from the Book of Oa. They are shown transforming the Star Sapphire into a violet power ring which they place on a pedestal along with a violet power battery. In discussion, they also describe how they'd been focused on love so long that they were almost like the emotionless Guardians. Depicted in the same room as the violet ring and battery, are a green and yellow set of powers rings and power batteries. Upon revealing this to the reader, the Zamarons comment that they \\"must collect them all.\\" Sins of the Star Sapphire Sins of the Star Sapphire, running in Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, issues #29‚Äì32 (December 2008 ‚Äì March 2009), is the story arc in which the formation of the Star Sapphires is shown. It both introduces important members of the new corps and reveals distinguishing features which set them apart from their peers. At the beginning of the arc, the Zamarons have crafted their own main power battery. Inside of their main battery are the crystallized \\"Adam and Eve\\" skeletons and Star Sapphire gem found when they first arrived on Zamaron. While experimenting with their new means of controlling the violet light of love, the Zamarons (perhaps intentionally) attracted the attention of the Guardians on Oa. Perceiving their visible power fluctuations as a threat, Guardian Scar decides to act on the display rather than wait and \\"hope for the best.\\" In response, she requests a diplomatic audience with Zamaron's Queen Aga'po. Two other Guardians accompany her, while Lanterns Guy Gardner, Arisia, and Sodam Yat serve as escorts.Green Lantern Corps (vol.2) #29 (December 2008) While on Zamaron, the delegates from Oa find that the Zamarons are in possession of a number of yellow power rings that were left unclaimed after the Sinestro Corps War plotline. The rings are shown being drained of their power (which Arisia interprets as a deliberate display of how the same could be done to green power rings). More importantly, the delegates also discover that a number of female Sinestro Corps members have also been collected after the war and are imprisoned in violet crystals. Queen Aga'po explains that the women imprisoned in the crystals (Fatality, Karu-Sil, and Kiriazis are specifically named, though other filled crystals are shown in Green Lantern vol. 4 #36) are being rehabilitated. The yellow light of fear is being drained from their rings and replaced with the violet light of love. Queen Aga'po also claims that violet light is filling an emptiness in their hearts and replacing their capacity for creating fear. The delegate meeting ends poorly for the Oans, as the Zamarons refuse to stop their pursuit of the violet light. Perhaps in response, the Guardians unanimously vote that love between Green Lanterns is forbidden within the Corps.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #31 (February 2009) A sub plot is also shown to the reader in Sins of the Star Sapphire which introduces a key member of the new Corps. In the secondary story, Mongul frees himself of Mother Mercy's vines after being imprisoned in Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, issue #26 (September 2008).Green Lantern Corps (vol.2) #27 (October 2008) Ravenous after his imprisonment, he destroys a space craft belonging to newlyweds Kered and Miri Riam (on their way to their honeymoon) in order to ransack it for food. Kered approaches Mongul to ask him to spare their jet packs and enough food for them to find help. In response, Mongul cracks the face plate of Kered's pressure suit, killing him. After Mongul leaves, Miri drifts in space alone for two days before deciding to kill herself out of grief. Before she is able to complete her suicide, a violet power ring finds her and offers to fill the hole in her heart with violet light. Miri accepts and becomes the first new recruit to the Star Sapphires. Miri quickly finds herself fighting for love as she assists a group of Green Lanterns attempting to apprehend Sinestro Corps member: Kryb. Through their temporary partnership they are able to defeat the yellow ring wielder. Though an argument ensues between Miri and Kyle Rayner (one of the Green Lanterns involved in the incident) over whether Kryb should be sent to Oa or Zamaron for detainment, it's agreed that Miri will escort Kryb back to Zamaron for reconditioning and re-education.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #32 (March 2009) Blackest Night In the issues of Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps serving as preludes to the Blackest Night event, the Star Sapphires continue to make preparations for the predicted conflict. After undergoing treatment within a violet conversion crystal, Fatality emerges as a newly transformed Star Sapphire. Her first thoughts upon being released are to seek out John Stewart (a Green Lantern she'd been trying to kill for causing the destruction of her home planet). Upon finding him, however, she saves him from Agent Orange's attacking Orange Lantern constructs, demonstrating that they are unable to absorb constructs made from violet light. She admits that revenge is no longer her goal, and that she has other plans.Green Lantern vol. 4 #41 (June 2009) In the following issue, she reveals that she's attracted to Stewart, may have always been, and the Star Sapphire has given her the ability to finally absolve herself of her survivor's guilt. After Fatality's successful conversion, Miri and Queen Aga'po observe that Kryb appears to be crying inside of her crystal (seemingly distraught over being separated from the children she kept imprisoned on her back). Queen Aga'po remarks that it is a sign the treatment is working.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #34 (May 2009) Carol Ferris once again gains the attention of the Zamarons as well. After a divorce and giving up the chance at being with Hal Jordan, he is no longer in her life and a hole in her heart has formed. While flying his former plane, the Zamarons send her one of their new violet power rings to fill it.Green Lantern vol. 4 #38 (March 2009) Ferris' reunion with the violet light is not fully shown until Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2 (July 2009). In Tales of the Star Sapphires: Lost Love, Ferris initially expects to be possessed by her violet power ring as had been the case with the Star Sapphire gem. The ring explains to her that the Zamarons have changed service to the Star Sapphires: it must be voluntary and now extends to an entire violet Corps. The ring reveals that Ferris has the potential of becoming the most powerful Star Sapphire, and also has the ability of leading the Star Sapphires into war alongside the Green Lantern Corps. At the end of the story, the power ring keeps its word and does not recruit Ferris until she gives it permission. She is, however, manipulated by being told that her love (Hal Jordan) may die depending upon the outcome of the War of Light. By joining the Star Sapphires, Ferris may be able to prevent that from happening.Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2 (July 2009) After his run-in with the Red Lanterns and Blue Lantern Corps during the Rage of the Red Lanterns plotline, Sinestro's attention turns from Oa to Zamaron. Before attempting to defeat a splinter cell of yellow ring wielders led by Mongul, he decides it's necessary to rescue the captured members of his Corps that are being converted into Star Sapphires. Glimpses of a planned Sinestro Corps attack are first shown coming to fruition in Blackest Night #1 (July 2009). Carol Ferris is depicted confronting the Sinestro Corps robot, Tekik, as conflict between the two Corps rages in the background.Blackest Night (vol. 1) #1 (July 2009) The passage taken from The Book of the Black at the end of Blackest Night #2 states that love will be the first emotion to fall in the Black Lantern Corps' crusade against the colored lights.Blackest Night #2 (August 2009) Green Lantern vol. 4 #45 and 46 depicts the battle between the Sinestro Corps and the Star Sapphires. During the conflict, the conversion crystals are compromised and the Sinestro Corps members inside are released. Kryb immediately abandons the battle to see to her children; she is followed by Sapphire Miri Riam and the two eventually reach Kryb's planet to find her children are gone. Kryb begs Miri to help her find her children promising to return to Zamaron of her own free will if Miri helps her. Miri senses that Kryb's love for her children is genuine and, despite the fact that Miri is repulsed by Kryb, agrees to help her. Back on Zamaron the battle takes an unexpected turn when deceased Sinestro Corps members resurrected as Black Lantern arrive. Carol Ferris and Sinestro are forced to work together until Hal Jordan and the Indigo Tribe arrive. The battle rages on until two black rings head for the violet Central Power Battery, bonding to the two crystallized lovers inside (who are Prince Khufu and his consort Chay-ara; the original forms of Hawkman and Hawkgirl). The two are transformed into Black Lanterns and their escape causes the battery to explode, causing widespread devastation to the planet and freeing the Predator. The damage is so great that the Sapphires are forced to abandon the planet to the Black Lanterns, fulfilling the Book of the Black's prophecy. Carol joins with Hal, Sinestro, and Indigo-1 to face Mongul on Korugar. The loss of the Central Power Battery does not appear to have affected Carol's powers.Green Lantern #46 (September 2009) Carol travels with the rest of the group to Okaara to recruit Larfleeze and Atrocitus. Then they head to Ryut to determine the status of the Black Central Power Battery.Green Lantern vol. 4 #48 (January 2010) Finding that it has been moved, they head to Earth with the intention of destroying the battery with the combined white light of creation. Ultimately though, the white light they produce fails to destroy the battery, and appears to feed Nekron's power.Blackest Night #5 (January 2010) When Ganthet duplicates the seven colored rings to deputize partners for each of the bearers, the violet ring chooses Wonder Woman as Carol's partner, deciding that she has great love in her heart, has love for all the creation and no one loves the light more than her on the planet. Wonder Woman was under the control of a black ring (from being one of numerous resurrected superheroes), but she and the violet ring's power are enough to break the black ring's hold, turning Wonder Woman into a Star Sapphire.Blackest Night #6 (February 2010)Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #3 Brightest Day In the aftermath of the Blackest Night, the Zamarons rebuilt the Central Power Battery and Queen Aga'po began using her life-force to power the battery until they could capture the Predator and reseal the entity into the Violet Power Battery in order to recharge it. For that mission the Zamarons contacted Carol Ferris on Earth, and reveal to her that the Predator was on the planet. While searching for the violet emotional entity, Carol travels to Las Vegas where she locates the Predator, now inhabiting the body of a man who is infatuated with a woman who does not even know who he is, and defeats it alongside Larfleeze and Hal who also had come searching for the love entity. The three then take the Predator back to Zamaron, however when Carol discovers the intentions of the Zamarons, she argues that the Guardians' technology that the Zamarons-based the battery on can be powered by the ambient love in the universe and refused to deliver the Predator. Upon hearing Carol's words, the Zamaron Queen Aga'po used the last of her life force to charge the Central Power Battery, leaving her title of Queen of the Star Sapphires to Carol.Green Lantern vol. 4 #57 (September 2010) Not much later, Zamaron is invaded by Queen Shriek of Hawkworld and her Hawk- Men. Carol and the Predator with the help from Hawkman and Hawkgirl tried to stop the Queen from taking the power of the Battery for herself, until the Predator bonded with the Queen. The Hawks eventually separate the Queen from the entity, as the skeletons from the Hawks past incarnations come alive due to the power of the Violet Battery and take Queen Shriek to the inside of the battery where she's sealed away with all the skeletons. New 52 The Zamarons are the first to acknowledge, after learning of Larfleeze's role in banishing the Orrery of Archangel Invictus into another dimension, that the events like Sinestro becoming a Green Lantern once again, the fall of the Sinestro Corps, the Red Lanterns' Central Battery being poisoned, the return of Invictus and the Reach invasion in Odym are no coincidence,Green Lantern: New Guardians #09 a fact that was currently revealed to be the Guardians of the Universe doing as they try to bring about the rise of the Third Army. Prominent members Leadership *Queen Aga'po (of Sector 1416): The queen of the Zamarons, who was asked by the Guardians if she will discontinue the Zamarons' pursuit of the violet light, but refuses.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #30 (November 2008) She is notified of the approach of the Sinestro Corps upon the Zamaron planet, and responds: \\"Yes. Let them come. For love will conquer all.\\" She sacrifices her life to power the Star Sapphire battery during Brightest Day, naming Carol the new queen. *Carol Ferris (of Sector 2814): The vice president of Ferris Aircraft, former love interest of Hal Jordan, and previous bearer of the position: Star Sapphire. After employing Jordan for a time as a pilot with Ferris Aircraft, he claims he cannot be near her without being with her. As she does not date employees, he left to resume his career in the United States Air Force.Green Lantern vol. 4 #32 (August 2008) Due to her heartache over Jordan's absence, a violet power ring was sent to tell her she has the potential to be the most powerful member of Star Sapphire Corps. The ring also tells her that, by leading the violet Corps, she will be in a position to protect Jordan during the War of Light; hearing this, she accepts the invitation. After the death of Queen Aga'po, she is named the Star Sapphires' new queen and is stated to be the most powerful Star Sapphire in the universe. Ring-bearers *Dela Pharon (of Sector 1416): The lover of the now deceased Green Lantern of space sector 1416 from the planet Xanador, whose extreme interpretation of \\"love\\" caused her to kill her lover and encase their world in a violet crystal so that they could \\"be together forever\\".Green Lantern vol. 4 #19 (June 2008) *Fatality (of Sector 1313): A princess from the planet Xanshi and former member of the Sinestro Corps, who was captured by the Zamarons after the Sinestro Corps War and sealed in a violet crystal meant to rehabilitate her yellow power ring. Fatality eventually emerges as a converted Star Sapphire, and immediately decides to locate John Stewart.Green Lantern vol. 4 #36 (January 2009) Formerly her adversary, her hatred for him has been transformed into romantic interest. *Miri Riam (of Sector 1852): A newly-wed from the planet Lartnec who was heading for her honeymoon when she and her new husband Kered were attacked by the space tyrant Mongul. Mongul destroyed their ship, murdered Kered, and leaves Miri to drift in space alone. Planning to follow her husband into death, her suicide is interrupted by the arrival of a violet power ring that offers to fill the hole of [her] broken heart with the light of the Star Sapphire and Miri accepts. *Miss Bloss (of Sector 1416): A Zamaron member of the Star Sapphire Corps who is first featured in Blackest Night promotional imagery. *Race: A female alien with yellow skin that is first featured in Blackest Night promotional imagery. *The Lost Sapphire: First featured and named in promotional imagery for the Blackest Night event, her appearance and identity are presently unknown.Blackest Night #0 (April 2009) Former members *Guy Gardner (of Sector 2814): The third male to belong to the Star Sapphire Corps, Guy used Carol Farris's Star Sapphire ring along with the Red Lantern Ring during the War of the Green Lanterns in order to remove Parallax from the Central Power Battery, powering the ring with his love for his role in the Corps; he is the first male shown to wield a Star Sapphire ring. *Abraham Pointe (of Sector 2814): The second male to belong to the Star Sapphires, who did not possess a violet ring, but was chosen to be the host of the Predator. The entity was eventually purged from Abraham's body which returned him to his human form. *Khea Taramka (of Sector 2814): The Queen of Hawkworld, while not possessing a ring, as the current host of the Predator, she does not need one.Brightest Day #17 The entity was eventually purged from Khea's body which returned her to normal. *Krona (of Sector 0): Krona temporarily became a member of the Star Sapphires when he put on Carol Ferris's power ring during the War of the Green Lanterns story-line. After he is killed, Carol's ring returns to Carol. The fourth male to belong to the Star Sapphires. *Superman-Prime (of Sector 2813): Superman-Prime temporarily became a member of the Star Sapphires during the Blackest Night storyline when a black power ring temporarily transforms him into a Star Sapphire. Also the first male to become a member of the Star Sapphires. *Wonder Woman (of Sector 2814): An Amazonian warrior and princess chosen to be a deputy member of the Corps. A duplicate of Carol's ring is able to free her from the influence of a black power ring by using the intense feelings of love in her heart, her love for the creation and her love for the light.Blackest Night #6 (December 2009) After her subconscious mind interacted with the ‚Äòdeceased‚Äô Batman (Bruce Wayne), Diana finally freed herself from the black ring‚Äôs influence. Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, is depicted as aiding Diana in accepting the ring.Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #2 Wonder Woman is later discharged from the Star Sapphires, following her final battle.Blackest Night #8 (March 2010) Conversion crystals A distinguishing feature that marks the Star Sapphires as unique among their peers, in Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps, is their use of conversion crystals. While other Corps exclusively recruit their members by sending out their rings in search of sentient beings, the Star Sapphires are also shown as being able to convert other Corps members into Star Sapphires. By encasing the members of other Corps within violet rehabilitation crystals on Zamaron, the light of their rings is slowly transformed into violet, whereupon they emerge as newly formed Star Sapphires, such as Yrra Cynril (Fatality). Similarly, violet power rings also momentarily encase new members to the Corps in crystal before granting them their Star Sapphire abilities and uniform. Those imprisoned within the crystals can be freed by an outside force, or free themselves if sufficiently motivated, interrupting the transformation process before it's complete.Green Lantern vol. 4 #45 (October 2009) The silhouettes of numerous Sinestro Corps members are shown within conversion crystals, but they are all released before their conversions are complete. The following characters have been depicted as escaping their crystals before becoming Star Sapphires: *Karu-Sil (of Sector 2815): Captured after the Sinestro Corps War. *Kiriazis (of Sector 1771): Captured after the Sinestro Corps War. Queen Aga'po mentions that Kiriazis is a good candidate for conversion. *Kryb (of Sector 3599): After being defeated by Miri Riam and a group of Green Lanterns, Miri took her back to Zamaron for rehabilitation. Miri later escorts Kryb back to the world where her \\"children\\" are kept. *Sinestro (of Sector 1417): While trying to free the others, Sinestro faces Carol Ferris. She briefly encases him inside of a conversion crystal, but after being shown a memory of his former paramour, Arin Sur, Sinestro is enraged and breaks free by himself. Lobo was placed in a crystal by Carol Ferris during his battle with her, Hal Jordan, Sinestro, Atrocitous, and Dex Starr. We never see what he does, but Lobo breaks out thanking her \\"for the peep show.\\" He then whispers to her what he really wants, causing Carol to smack him with a giant hand created by her ring.Green Lantern(vol.4) #55 It was originally believed that this process simply awakened the love each of these people already had inside them, allowing them to love without being inhibited by other emotions. Statements by Fatality after her ring is destroyed seem to indicate that the conversion process instead forces the convert to feel love regardless of their actual feelings, placing them essentially under mind control.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #34 (August 2014) Entity Originally believed to be one of the subconscious identities developed by Carol Ferris, which acted as a masculine animus to the feminine anima of Star Sapphire, the Predator repeatedly appeared as a mysterious figure, protecting Carol's beloved company from the threats of Eclipso, the Demolition Team, and Jason Bloch. He also established the company Intercontinental Petroleum (Con-Trol) to let her regain control of Ferris Aircraft. Finally, the Predator started to court Carol (who did not know that the Predator was a part of herself) and battled Hal Jordan for her love.Green Lantern vol. 2 #192 (September 1985). The Predator was later assumed to have been killed by Nekron. During the Blackest Night, it was revealed through the Guardian known as \\"Scar\\" that the Predator is actually the sentient embodiment of Love: 'love with nothing to temper it'; and one of seven Embodiments of the Emotional Spectrum resembling a reptilian creature,Green Lantern (vol.4) #43 (July 2009) which had been held captive by the Zamarons within a crystal chamber; the length of this containment is unknown. The entity emphasizes the aggressive nature in one's being, making the subject paranoid and highly obsessive. The Predator imbues its host with the power to latch onto and manipulate people's minds, and is able to change and affect them at the host's will. Queen Aga'po mentions to one of her attendants that Carol Ferris would be an ideal candidate for taming the Predator.Green Lantern vol. 4 #45 When the planet Zamaron was attacked by Black Lanterns who succeeded in destroying the Star Sapphire Central Power Battery, the Predator was able to escape its crystalline containment and return to the universe at large. The Predator, like all the other emotional entities, was attracted to Earth by the Entity and is now being hunted by Krona. The white entity intones for Hal, Carol, and Sinestro to find them before it is too late. According to Atrocitus' divining ritual, the emotional entities had come to Earth and the Predator should be located somewhere in the southwestern United States.Green Lantern #54 (July 2010) After battling an Ophidian-possessed Hector Hammond, Hal and Larfleeze traveled to Las Vegas, where Carol Ferris was already hunting the love entity. There the Predator possessed a man named Abraham Pointe, who was obsessed with a woman named Lisa. After attempting to have its host meet the target of his affection, the Predator became corrupted by the man's infatuation with the woman, as Abraham did not know what true love was. Discovered by Carol, Hal, and Larfleeze, the four battled within a casino as the Predator-possessed Abraham attempted to reach Lisa. Knowing the only way to win was to allow Abraham to feel love, Carol kissed the man and severed his connection to the Predator. With the entity subdued, Carol, Hal, and Larfleeze were teleported to Zamaron with the Predator. Carol successfully defended the Predator from having the Zamarrons imprisoning it back within the Star Sapphire Central Power Battery and, in doing so, became the new Queen of the Star Sapphires.Green Lantern vol. 4 #57 Zamaron was soon after attacked by forces from Hawkworld. The Predator was ridden into combat by Carol, until it sensed the complete lack of love in the heart of Hawkworld's leader, Queen Shrike (mother of Shiera Hall). The Predator then proceeded to bond with the evil queen,Brightest Day #17 however the entity was soon drawn out of its host by the love felt between Hawkman and Hawkgirl.Brightest Day #18 Later it is revealed through Carol that the Predator was captured by Krona.Green Lanter #63 The Predator was later seen with Krona on Oa where it possessed one of the remaining six Guardians of the Universe.Green Lantern vol. 4 #64 (May 2011) Predator was eventually free from Krona's control when the rogue Guardian was killed by Hal Jordan and is once again at large in the universe.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #67 (July 2011) Oath Just as the Green Lanterns and other Lantern Corps recharge their own rings, the following is the oath used by Star Sapphires to recharge their violet power rings: Powers and abilities Violet power ring Corp members of the Star Sapphires use violet power rings, fueled by the emotion of love. They allow the wearer to fly, generate a protective aura, and create violet light constructs. Violet rings have several unique abilities. They can create crystals which can be used to imprison members of other Lantern Corps on Zamaron. Over time, the rings of the prisoners trapped in stasis within the crystals are infected with violet energy. After spending enough time inside, the prisoner will emerge as a Star Sapphire. The rings can also detect when a love is in jeopardy, locate it, and then create a connection to the embattled heart that can be used as a tether. Sapphires are also shown as being able to show others their greatest love. Unlike constructs created by Green Lanterns, Orange Lanterns cannot absorb those made by Star Sapphires. Star Sapphires appear to be able to teleport in order to escape attackers, while their energy constructs release a disorienting dust when destroyed. These two abilities can be combined effectively to avoid being pursued.Green Lantern vol. 4 #42 (June 2009) Violet power rings have the ability to restore the recently deceased to life by drawing power from the heart of one that loves them.Green Lantern Corps (Vol.2)#43 Though Star Sapphires do not have a weakness to other Corps (they are immune to the energy stealing properties of an Orange Power Ring), they are more susceptible to being controlled by their own power. Love is one of the two emotions on the far ends of the emotional spectrum, and has a much stronger influence over its users. Unlike the Star Sapphire gem, which could force itself on a user, violet power rings must be accepted by the wearer. In other media Television * The Star Sapphires appear in Green Lantern: The Animated Series. Debuting in the episode \\"In Love and War\\", Queen Aga'po is their leader. This version starts out as a villain group, as their conception of love involves trapping men in crystalline stasis chambers, putting them in a permanent euphoric state to ensure nothing bad will happen to them. They rely on their charms to convince men to be trapped willingly, or, if those men already have true loves, attempt to recruit said true loves. Carol Ferris is briefly recruited in an attempt to seduce Hal Jordan, but the ring's effect causes her to turn crazy and attack Hal. He is finally able to bring her back to her senses through a kiss, and she decides to reject the Star Sapphire ring, stating that the Zamarons' methods are not love, but selfishness. One of the Star Sapphire's novices is struck by her speech, and helps Hal and the others to escape, planning to teach her comrades the true meaning of love. In the episode \\"Homecoming\\", it is shown that they have stopped being fanatical. They help Hal and Razer by transporting them to Earth and Oa, respectively. In the episode \\"Love is a Battlefield\\", the Star Sapphires are attacked by Aya and the Manhunters for the spreading the message of love. As a result, they call back Carol to explain love to Aya. To help prove her case she had to fight Atrocitus. At the end of the episode, she decides to keep the ring this time just in case.

It asks whether there is a positive integer M such that every sequence of M or more integer squares, whose second difference is constant and equal to 2, is necessarily a sequence of squares of the form (x + i)2, i = 1, 2, ..., M,... for some integer x. In 1983, Douglas Hensley observed that B√ºchi's problem is equivalent to the following: Does there exist a positive integer M such that, for all integers x and a, the quantity (x + n)2 + a cannot be a square for more than M consecutive values of n, unless a = 0? Statement of B√ºchi's problem B√ºchi's problem can be stated in the following way: Does there exist a positive integer M such that the system of equations : \\\\begin{cases} x_2^2-2x_1^2+x_0^2=2\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_3^2-2x_2^2+x_1^2=2\\\\\\\\\\\\ {}\\\\quad\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_{M-1}^2-2x_{M-2}^2+x_{M-3}^2=2 \\\\end{cases} has only solutions satisfying x_n^2=(x_0+n)^2. Since the first difference of the sequence \\\\sigma=(x_n^2)_{n=0,\\\\dots,M-1} is the sequence \\\\Delta^{(1)}(\\\\sigma)=(x_{n+1}^2-x_n^2)_{n=0,\\\\dots,M-2}, the second difference of \\\\sigma is : \\\\Delta^{(2)}(\\\\sigma)=((x_{n+2}^2-x_{n+1}^2)-(x_{n+1}^2-x_n^2))_{n=0,\\\\dots,M-3}=(x_{n+2}^2-2x_{n+1}^2+x_n^2)_{n=0,\\\\dots,M-3}. Therefore, the above system of equations is equivalent to the single equation : \\\\Delta^{(2)}(\\\\sigma)=(2)_{n=0,\\\\dots,M-3} where the unknown is the sequence \\\\sigma. Examples Observe that for any integer x we have : (\\\\star)\\\\qquad(x+2)^2-2(x+1)^2+x^2=2. Hence the equation x_2^2-2x_1^2+x_0^2=2 has solutions, called trivial B√ºchi sequences of length three, such that x_2^2=(x_0+2)^2 and x_1^2=(x_0+1)^2. For example, the sequences (2, 3, 4) and (2, ‚àí3, 4) are trivial B√ºchi sequences. A nontrivial B√ºchi sequence of length three is given for example by the sequence (0, 7, 10), as it satisfies 102 ‚àí 2¬∑72 + 02 = 2, while 02, 72 and 102 are not consecutive squares. Replacing x by x + 1 in equation (\\\\star), we obtain (x+3)^2-2(x+2)^2+(x+1)^2=2. Hence the system of equations : \\\\begin{cases} x_2^2-2x_1^2+x_0^2=2\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_3^2-2x_2^2+x_1^2=2 \\\\end{cases} has trivial B√ºchi solutions of length 4, namely the one satisfying x_n^2=(x_0+n)^2 for n = 0, 1, 2, 3\\\\. In 1983, D. Hensley showed that there are infinitely many nontrivial B√ºchi sequences of length four. It is not known whether there exist any non-trivial B√ºchi sequence of length five (Indeed, B√ºchi asked originally the question only for M = 5.). Original motivation A positive answer to B√ºchi's problem would imply, using the negative answer to Hilbert's Tenth Problem by Yuri Matiyasevich, that there is no algorithm to decide whether a system of diagonal quadratic forms with integer coefficients represents an integer tuple. Indeed, B√ºchi observed that squaring, therefore multiplication, would be existentially definable in the integers over the first-order language having two symbols of constant for 0 and 1, a symbol of function for the sum, and a symbol of relation P to express that an integer is a square. Some results Paul Vojta proved in 1999 that a positive answer to B√ºchi's Problem would follow from a positive answer to a weak version of the Bombieri‚ÄìLang conjecture. In the same article, he proves that the analogue of B√ºchi's Problem for the field of meromorphic functions over the complex numbers has a positive answer. Positive answers to analogues of B√ºchi's Problem in various other rings of functions have been obtained since then (in the case of rings of functions, one adds the hypothesis that not all xn are constant).

Its Director- General is a serving two-star general officer of the Pakistan Army, and is located at Chaklala cantonment. However, as an inter-services organisation it is overseen by the Joint Services Headquarters, and works closely with the Strategic Plans Division (SPD). Created in 1963 in the Ministry of Defence, DESTO's clandestine work included in reverse engineering of the foreign technology and to avoid technological surprise from India. A limited amount knowledge of DESTO's project is available and much of its work is kept under secrecy. Among its various responsibilities it is Pakistan's national centre of expertise in chemical and biological defence.http://www.ndma.gov.pk/plans/National%20Contingency%20Plan%20to%20Manage%20Industrial_Technical%20Disasters2010.pdf  History  The DESTO was established in 1963 by the Ministry of Defence on the recommendation adopted from the National Science Commission. The DESTO was established in a view of avoiding any technological surprise from India. Since its foundation, scientists at DESTO reportedly started studying the Wind tunnel and the applications of the fluid dynamics; its contribution in the field of research and development is significant. During this time, DESTO began its secret programme on developing the rocket propelled 120-mm caliber high explosive mortar ammunition, variable time fuze, and free flight rockets. Its further programmes included the evaluation and reverse engineering of the foreign technology for the use of by the military. DESTO conducts research and development on weapon systems, military technologies, and renders technical advice on weapons‚Äìrelated technological issues to the government. DESTO retains its expertise on variety of disciplines such as aerodynamics, propulsion, electronics, computer systems, engineering, explosives, metallurgy, chemical and biological defence. Since 2001, DESTO's multi- disciplinary infrastructure base is now available to public sector industry under commercial arrangements. Projects and research work at DESTO remains under strict secrecy and very few details of the projects are known to the public.  Involvement in nuclear weapons  By the early 1970s, DESTO maintained its classified projects towards the Wind tunnels and successfully reverse engineered its own version of the wind tunnel in 1974 roughly based on Dutch firm, the Stork-Werkspoor. Following the surprise nuclear test, Smiling Buddha, by India in 1974, PAEC chair Munir Ahmad Khan and Abdus Salam chaired a meeting with the officials of DESTO over the technological surprise of India. Zaman Sheikh‚Äîa chemical engineer from DESTO‚Äîwas tasked to developed chemical explosive lenses, tampers, and triggering mechanized system, necessary in the technology of the fission weapon together with Hafeez Qureshi‚Äîa mechanical engineer. The codename for this project was Wah Group Scientists (WGS), and the work was done in the Metallurgical Laboratory at the Wah Cantonment in 1978. Later, it was renamed as Directorate for Technical Development (DTD), and was charged with the design testings of the weapons. After Pakistan conducted nuclear tests‚Äîcodename: Chagai-I and Chagai-II‚Äîin May 1998, the United States Government identified and sanctioned DESTO for involvement in Pakistan's nuclear and missile programmes.\\"India and Pakistan Sanctions and Other Measures,\\" 63 Federal Register 223 (19 November 1998), pp. 64322-64342. The exact details of the work and contribution to missile systems remains under strict secrecy.Presidential Determination No. 2001-28 22 September 2001: Waiver of Nuclear-Related Sanctions on India and Pakistan, Memorandum for the Secretary of State,\\" 66 Federal Register 191 (2 October 2001), p. 50095; \\"India and Pakistan: Lifting of Sanctions, Removal of Indian and Pakistani Entities, and Revision in License Review Policy,\\" 66 Federal Register 190 (1 October 2001), p. 50090, and Dianne E. Rennack, India and Pakistan: U.S. Economic Sanctions, CRS Report to Congress RS20995 (Washington, DC: The Library of Congress, 3 February 2003). However, after Pakistan's heavy contribution on war on terror, the American government uplifted the sanctions on DESTO. Extended programme In 2000, it was reported that DESTO had achieved a major breakthrough in ammunition technology by developing ammunition for 120 mm mortar. DESTO's programme had ingeniously developed and manufactured ammunition for 120 mm mortar which has almost doubled the range of conventional ammunition with very less cost effect. Further tests were carried out by DESTO to check the technology and it enhanced the range of all artillery ammunition up to 30%.

Early life and education John Brown was born into the Tiger Clan of his Seminole mother, Lucy Nancy Greybeard, on October 23, 1842, near Fort Gibson, Oklahoma. He was of mixed race and was the eldest child of seven; their father was Dr. John Frippo Brown, Sr., a physician from Scotland.

They were raised in both their parents' cultures but lived among and identified as Seminole. Brown served in the Confederate Army as an officer under the Seminole chief John Jumper. He represented the Seminole Nation in postwar negotiations as a Southern Treaty Commission Delegate and signed the Reconstruction Treaty of 1866. In 1867, Brown's parents died in a cholera epidemic. His 15-year-old sister Alice moved from their home near Fort Gibson to Wewoka, Oklahoma to live with him. Chief of the Seminole Nation After the Seminole Nation agreed to the Reconstruction Treaty of 1866, there was a period of friction due to the U.S. government's recognition of Big John Chupco as the Chief of the Seminole. However, the majority of the tribe followed the leadership of John Jumper. The tribe soon elected its own chief and chose Jumper, who resigned soon afterward. Brown, who was a member of the Tiger Clan and Jumper's son-in-law, was next elected chief.\\"Seminole History\\" , The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes. Accessed 25 Sept 2009.

Following Micco's death in 1905, Brown was re-elected and served until tribal government was abolished in 1906 in preparation for admitting the Indian and Oklahoma territories as the state of Oklahoma. Brown negotiated the Seminole agreement with the Dawes Commission in 1897, which preceded the division of communal land into plots for separate households, as part of a plan for assimilation to majority culture. He served as a delegate to the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention in 1905, the effort by Native Americans in Indian Territory to write a constitution for an all-Indian-controlled state, to be admitted separately from the eastern section of present-day Oklahoma. They were unsuccessful in gaining US Congressional approval for such an action. As chief of the tribe, Brown traveled to Washington, D.C., frequently to meet with national leaders.

Antonio Rincon was employed by France on several missions to Poland and Hungary between 1522 and 1525. At that time, following the 1522 Battle of Bicoque, Francis I was attempting to ally with king Sigismund I the Old of Poland.The Papacy and the Levant (1204-1571) by Kenneth M. Setton As Sigismond was not forthcoming, Francis I instead chose to support Janos Zapolya in Hungary. A Franco-Hungarian alliance would be concluded in 1528 through a treaty. Antonio Rincon was sent by King Francis I of France to the Ottoman court in July 1530 seemingly to negotiate a military agreement against Emperor Charles V.Francis I by R. J. Knecht p.224 He also attempted to negotiate an Ottoman loan to the French crown, but was denied it on the ground that a Muslim could not lend money to Christians. Rincon was again sent to the Ottoman court in March 1532. He told one of his friends (count Guido Rangone, a Modenese soldier whose expertise as a military engineer had been demonstrated in the remodelling of the defenses at Pinerolo) that the king of France had given him various secret commissions, none of which he could reveal, as he had been expressly commanded by the king not to say a word about them \\"either to the Grand Master or to the Admiral of France, both of whom were opposed to his warlike plans... \\" La politique orientale de Fran√ßois Ier, ('15-'47) by Ion Ursu, p 56 In fact, he was to try to obtain an Ottoman offensive against Italy, rather than the offensive against Hungary that the Ottomans were planning.Francis I by R.

Rincon in turn became an official French Ambassador to the Ottoman court from 1538 to 1541. In January 1541 Rincon and his party arrived from Constantinople at Venice, ill and weary from stormy travel. There he met Lorenzo Gritti, a surviving son of the Venetian doge (his adventurous brother Lodovico Gritti was dead), and a Genoan named Cesare Fregoso. In their company, he made the hazardous journey that \\"in those times of jealousy and division\\" separated Venice from Paris.

It is estimated that more than 300 million tons of cyclic salt is deposited on the Earth's surface each year, and it is considered to be a significant factor in the chlorine content of the Earth's river water.Kostock, Dennis. The Material Flow of Salt. (U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Information Circular 9343, 1990), pg. 4.Bulletin - United States Geological Survey, Issue 330. (Harvard: The Survey, 1908), 48. In general, cyclic salt deposits are lower at sites further inland and are most abundant along the shoreline, although this pattern varies depending on the given environmental conditions.Clarke, Frank Wigglesworth. \\"The data of geochemistry,\\" in Issue 491 of U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin. (Government Printing Office, 1911), 138-139. Use of the term \\"cyclic\\" refers to the cycle in which the salt moves from sea to land and is then washed by rainwater back to the sea. The salt (and other solid matter) cannot evaporate as water does. Instead it leaves the ocean surface in fine droplets of drop impacts or bubble bursts. Wave-crests and other turbulence form foam. When drops splash or bubbles burst, fine droplets of solute are ejected from the water or bubble surface into the air. Some of the droplets are small enough to allow the water to evaporate before it falls back into the sea, leaving in the air a mote of the solid residue light enough to stay suspended by Brownian motion and be carried away on the wind.

It focuses on northern German prehistory and early history as well as the history of the former city of Harburg. The museum is also home to the cultural heritage landmarks commission of the city of Hamburg and the adjacent district of Harburg in Lower-Saxony and thus supervises all archaeological undertakings in the region. The museum has two major exhibition spaces. The future City Museum of Harburg, temporary exhibitions, the library, offices and small storage facilities are located in the main building, which is shared with the Harburger Theater at . The permanent archaeological exhibition and education facilities are located nearby, at . In addition, the Museum maintains as external branches the exhibition area of the 12th-century (Bishop's Tower) in Hamburg's old town, the archaeological trail at and the 8th-century hillfort of Hollenstedt.  Exhibition  Archaeological exhibitions building With more than 2.5 million objects, the museum holds the largest collection of prehistoric finds. On exhibit are mostly local examples of the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras, the Bronze and Iron Ages, the Migration Period and the Early Middle Ages in northern Germany. In 2009, the newly designed permanent archaeological exhibition opened. It is structured in the following subject areas: materials, food, violence, death, innovation and mobility. In more than 160 glass display cases, models and large exhibit items represent all aspects of human cultural development over the last 40,000 years. In addition, installations on cultural heritage landmarks, the archaeology of Hamburg, and methods of collection and preservation provide information about the work of the museum and archaeologists. Some of the notable exhibits are the Duvensee paddle (one of the oldest surviving paddles), the Metzendorf-Woxdorf head burial, the Bronze Age Daensen folding chair, the Ovelg√∂nne Bread Roll, the Saxon Wulfsen horse burial, the Tangendorf disc brooch, a section of the Wittmoor Bog Trackway and the Maschen disc brooch. A second permanent exhibition on the local history of the Harburg borough is due to be opened in the near future.  History  The museum's foundation was initiated in 1898 by the Hamburg Senator August Helms, who was joined by other public figures in a museum association. Their aim was to create a museum for the then independent Prussian city of Harburg (Elbe) and their county. In 1925, the founder's sons deeded the museum a prestigious villa in to use as an exhibition hall, and the museum was renamed Helms- Museum. By that time, the collection already had more than 50,000 catalogued objects. In 1937, the Helms-Museum became a public institution. In 1955, the Museum left the villa, which had been damaged by a bomb in World War II, and moved to a new main building next to the Harburger Theater. In 1953, Director Willi Wegewitz initiated the open-air . In 1972, the Helms-Museum became Hamburg's only archaeological museum, and all archaeological holdings at other Hamburg museums were transferred to it. Since 1987, the museum has been entrusted with the preservation of cultural heritage landmarks. For space reasons, the archaeological permanent exhibition was moved to its present location at . A third exhibition area was maintained from 1990 to 1999 at the old Harburg Fire Station. On 1 January 2008, the ownership of the Helms-Museum transferred to the (Foundation of Hamburg Historical Museums), and it was renamed '. On 14 May 2009 the newly designed permanent archaeological exhibition was opened.  Visitors  The museum participates in the Long Night of Museums of Hamburg, and offers a variety of educational programs for children and school classes. Since the Museum has provided an interactive electronic museum guide as an iTunes mobile app, also available for Android operating systems.https://plus.google.com/112946114730381657998/posts?hl=en  See also  * List of museums and cultural institutions in Hamburg  Literature  *  References   External links  * Official website * AMH-Guide - Arch√§ologisches Museum Hamburg Electronic museums guide as App for iTunes Category:Museums established in 1898 Category:Museums in Hamburg Category:Buildings and structures in Harburg, Hamburg Category:Archaeological museums in Germany Category:1898 establishments in Germany ","title":"Arch√§ologisches Museum Hamburg"},{"id":"24472253","text":"The logo of the Festival ITEF - The Istanbul Tanpƒ±nar Literature Festival, named after the famous modernist Turkish poet, novelist, essayist, and critic Ahmet Hamdi Tanpƒ±nar, is an international literary event held in the city of Istanbul to focus on a variety of genres, and to bring together writers, publishers, literary translators, critics and journalists for a series of inspirational encounters.

Along with Joseph Unger he is considered to be one of the founders of modern Austrian jurisprudence. He joined the Auersperg cabinet as Minister of Justice in 1871. Upon resigning this office in 1879, he was appointed attorney-general at the Vienna Court of Cassation, a position he held until his death. Glaser was a prominent representative of Austrian High Liberalism, with a particular emphasis on the cultural and political preeminence of the German part of the Empire. He was responsible for several liberal penal law reforms, most notably the 1873 Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure, and he advocated the abolition of the death penalty. Life Born in Postelberg, Bohemia to a family of Jewish traders of humble means, Glaser later converted to Christianity. In 1849, at the age of 18, he attained his doctorate of philosophy at the University of Z√ºrich and gained a reputation as a criminalist thanks to a monograph on English and Scottish criminal procedure (Das englisch-schottische Strafverfahren, Vienna, 1850). In 1854, after also obtaining a doctorate of law in Vienna, he achieved habilitation as Privatdozent for Austrian criminal law at the University of Vienna. In 1856 he was appointed associate professor of criminal law, and in 1860, ordinary (tenured) professor. In 1871 he entered the Auersperg cabinet as Minister of Justice. Resigning this office in 1879, he was appointed Attorney-General at the Vienna Court of Cassation, which position he held until his death. From 1871 to 1879 he represented Vienna in the House of Representatives as a member of the Liberal party, and later became a member of the House of Lords. A prominent representative of Austrian High Liberalism, he particularly emphasized the cultural and political preeminence of the German part of the Empire. He died in 1885 of pneumonia, leaving behind a widow, Wilhelmine (n√©e L√∂wenthal), a son and two daughters. They obtained the hereditary title of Freiherr to which Glaser's decorations had entitled him. Legacy Glaser in 1872 Described as a \\"liberal reformer of Austrian penal law\\", along with Joseph Unger he is considered to be one of the founders of modern Austrian jurisprudence. Glaser's principal legislative accomplishment was the 1873 Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure, the first Austrian code to introduce the principles of immediacy and publicity, trial by jury, and trial based on specific charges (Anklageprinzip). As a scholar, he is best remembered for his Handbook of Criminal Procedure (1883/85), a systematic overview of German criminal procedure with wide-ranging comparative and historical notes. He advocated introducing jury courts and opposed the death penalty. Among other decorations, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold and made a Knight of the Order of the Iron Crown.

Biography The son of an Imperial German Navy officer, Koch was born in Benevento.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 212 Koch served as a lieutenant in the Grenadiers where he was unpopular with his fellow soldiers and was dismissed from the army in 1939 for insulting a superior officer. Recalled on the eve of the war, he saw continuous service until the armistice of September 1943, after which he moved to Florence. Settling in the Social Republic in the north of Italy, Koch joined the Special Service of Republican Police led by Tullio Tamburini. In January 1944, he established the Banda Koch as a special task force charged with hunting down partisans and rounding up deportees for the Germans. Koch came under the protection of Herbert Kappler, SD chief in Koch's base of Rome, and as such had a free hand to employ whatever tactics he saw fit with Banda Koch, which soon became a by-word for cruelty and violence. Koch was given his own prisons and torture chambers and continued his activity in Florence and then Milan following the fall of Rome to the Allies. Along with police chief Pietro Caruso, who was independently involved in the killing of partisans, Koch was behind hundreds of deaths; the Social Republic government even ordered an amnesty for political prisoners not charged with murder out of fear that Koch would have them killed.Nicholas Farrell, Mussolini A New Life, Phoenix, 2004, pp. 449-450 Feared even by Benito Mussolini for his violent extremism, Il Duce eventually had his close ally Renzo Montagna arrest Koch for his excesses in October 1944. He soon fell into Allied hands, was tried by an Italian tribunal and was convicted of six charges at the High Court. He was executed at Rome's Forte Bravetta aged 26.

He operated a hotel in Sherbrooke, North Dakota and served as county judge from 1894 to 1905. Early life Washington I. Warrey was born in Columbia County, New York, August 25, 1855. He and his younger sister were the only two children born to Robert and Hannah (Carver) Warrey. His father had three children from a previous marriage as did his mother, for a total of eight children. When Warrey was a child, the family moved to Binghamton, New York, where his father worked at contracting and building. Robert Warrey was an architect and designer, and also worked as a carpenter. During the U.S. Civil War, his father was in charge of a force of pontoon and bridge builders. College Robert died when Washington was nine years old, and Washington then went to live on a farm for two years. When his mother died in 1867, he moved in with an uncle, who was appointed his guardian. At the age of 17, he became an apprentice mason, but eventual sought a more liberal education. At age 19, he enrolled in the Delaware Literary Institute at Franklin, New York, where he studied for four years. He studies are frequently interrupted by several terms where he taught school in the village and countryside. Education was a part of his family history, as a number of his mother's relatives had been leading professors in Amherst College and other universities in the east. Mr. Warrey eventually wanted to pursue law practice. In 1880 he moved to Wyandotte County in Kansas where he worked as a carpenter and as a member of the local police force, and studied law in his spare time. This added strain caused his health to deteriorate, so he began carpentry work full-time and later became foreman of a crew for the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railway Company. Warrey was a member of the Masons, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Modern Woodmen of America. North Dakota Washington I. Warrey's health never did improve, so in August 1884 he moved to Fargo, then part of Dakota Territory. He taught school for several winters in Steele and Cass Counties. He married Rose L. Wallace, a resident of Page, in 1888. They had four children, Victor I., Edward R., Lillian E., and Washington I. In the spring of 1895, he filed a land claim in Broadlawn Township in Steele County.

Built in 1909, it was one of the first reinforced steel, concrete and brick buildings in the area and was advertised as being completely fireproof. The building is historically associated with the country's only Union-owned daily newspaper, The Seattle Union Record and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Butterworth Building, another National Register property, neighbors it to the north. History The Alaska Trade Building was built by contractor James Steele in 1909 replacing a two-story wooden building known as the 'Rose Block' that pre-dated the Great Seattle fire.Seattle, Washington Territory (Fire Insurance Map).(1st ed.). New York: Sanborn Map and Publishing Company, 1888 It was designed by Seattle architect J.C. Taft in a very utilitarian style with almost no ornamentation. Original plans for the building published in the Seattle Times called for an eight-story building trimmed in Granite and Terra cotta that would cost $135,000 to build but only the first four floors were ever built.\\"Steele Building for First Avenue\\" Seattle Times 7 Mar. 1909. In late 1910, the unfinished building was purchased from Steele by Portland, Oregon developers J.O. Storey and Thomas Lavake.\\"Portland Man Buys More Property Here\\" Seattle Times 12 Dec. 1910. The building was purchased by the Central Labor Council and the local Trade Union in 1915. The Seattle Union Record was established as a weekly paper in 1910 by the Central Labor Council. The council's secretary, E.B. \\"Harry\\" Ault, became editor in 1912 and would expand the paper to a daily in 1918. Under Ault's leadership, the paper grew from a circulation of 3,000 to 50,000 to over 112,000 in 1919. Seeking larger quarters, the paper was moved into the Alaska Trade Building in 1921. When Dave Beck took control of the Central Labor Council, he sold the paper to Ault in 1924.

He was the third of his brothers to be elected as chief. (His older brothers Jackson Frazier McCurtain and Edmund McCurtain had previously been elected as chief, serving a total of three terms.) He was a Progressive Republican in the late 19th century, leaning toward allotment and assimilation when the nation was under pressure by the United States government, as he believed the Choctaw needed to negotiate to secure their best outcome prior to annexation. After 1906 and dissolution of tribal governments under the Dawes Act prior to Oklahoma achieving statehood, and the annexation of the Choctaw Republic by the United States, McCurtain was appointed as chief by the United States government. He served in that capacity until 1910 and his death in office. He was the last freely-elected Chief of the Choctaws until 1971. Green McCurtain represented his tribe as a delegate at the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention. This was an effort by American Indian nations in Indian Territory to create an Indian-controlled state in what is now Oklahoma. They were not successful in getting Congressional support for this proposal. European Americans, who had established considerable presence in the Oklahoma Territory, had lobbied strongly for the entire area to be admitted as a regular state. Personal life Greenwood \\"Green\\" McCurtain was born on November 28, 1848 in Skullyville, Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory, the third son of Cornelius McCurtain, born in Mississippi, and Mayhiya \\"Amy\\" Blevins, both Choctaw. He was named after leader Greenwood LeFlore. Blevins's grandmother was Sho-Ma-Ka, a captive from a neighboring tribe who was adopted and assimilated into the Choctaw. McCurtain's paternal ancestry was of Irish origin. His Irish immigrant ancestor was Cornelius McCurtain, nephew of Cornelius Curtain, from County Cork, who settled in Spanish Florida in the 18th century with a land grant from the Spanish crown. He became a trader and married into the Choctaw tribe.https://www.genealogy.com/ftm/b/o/w/Charles-Bowman-Fl/GENE2-0012.html In 1833 McCurtain's parents and older brother Jackson had moved with numerous other Choctaw to Indian Territory as part of Indian Removal and the Choctaw Trail of Tears. His family became prominent as leaders of the tribe. His older brothers were Jackson Frazier McCurtain, born in Mississippi (1830-1885); Edmund Aaron McCurtain, (1842-1890); and David Cornelius McCurtain (1846-1874). They also had a younger brother Robert McCurtain (1853-1874), who was fatally shot at age 20 by a cousin. Green's older brother Jackson Frazier McCurtain became a leader and served as president of the Choctaw senate before succeeding Isaac Garvin as president. Jackson served 1880-1884; he was succeeded by his brother Edmund, who served 1884-1886, a total of three two- year terms by the two of them.\\"Choctaw Nation Elected Chiefs.\\" RootsWeb.Ancestry.com. Retrieved 25 Sept 2009. Marriage and family McCurtain was a Baptist, at a time when numerous Choctaw had become Protestants, influenced by missionaries.Thoburn 2164 He married Martha Ainsworth, a European-American woman, and together they had a son, D.C. McCurtain. He later lived in Spiro, Oklahoma. The senior McCurtain later married his second wife, Kate 'Kittie' Spring. They had a son and four daughters together: Alice, Lena, Bertha and Cora. Political career McCurtain was an imposing man, described as six foot two. He had a variety of positions locally and in the tribe before becoming principal chief after his brothers. In 1872 he served as sheriff of Skullyville County. By the late nineteenth century, he represented the Tuskahoma, or Progressive party of his tribe, also known as the \\"Eagles\\", who began to favor negotiation with the United States over proposals for allotment and statehood of the Choctaw communal lands. Originally opposed to this, McCurtain came to believe he needed to negotiate to try to achieve the best outcome for the Choctaw. The nation was violently torn by the prospect of losing their sovereign governance and lands: the day after the 1884 elections, Nationalist Charles Wilson was brutally killed. While more than one Progressive was implicated in the assassination, several Choctaw were acquitted and only Jackson Crow, an African American, was convicted and executed for the crime. In the 1890s, Silan Lewis, a committed Nationalist, killed five Progressives in related retaliatory political assassinations. He was convicted and executed by the Choctaw in 1894. McCurtain continued to gain power in this period. He served as Choctaw National Treasurer for two terms and oversaw the distribution of $2 million in treaty settlements. Twice he served as the Choctaw Delegate to the U.S. federal government in Washington, DC. He served as a member of his district's board of education within the tribe. In addition, he served as district attorney. In 1896 and 1898, McCurtain was elected as Principal Chief of the Choctaw Nation. Term limits prevented him from a third successive term. In 1902, he was eligible to run again and won the election. He won a fourth term in 1904. Before Oklahoma was admitted as a state, McCurtain represented the Choctaw Nation and served as a vice president at the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention in 1905. Attendees discussed proposals for Indian Territory to be admitted as a separate state, under Native American control. It is thought to have laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Constitution.Mize, Richard, Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Sequoyah Convention,\\" Accessed October 6, 2013. Under the Dawes Act, in 1906 the U.S. government broke up tribal governments and institutions. The Bureau of Indian Affairs appointed McCurtain as chief. He acted under BIA supervision until his death in office in 1910. Although originally a member of the Democratic Party, which represented a solid block in the states of the former Confederacy, McCurtain came to believe their Congressional delegation was hostile to his people. He shifted his affiliation to the Republican Party, and many of his tribesmen did the same. In those years, the Democrats had established the Solid South, a block they controlled because of having disenfranchised most blacks, Natives and other minorities at the turn of the century, and retaining full control of the region's congressionally apportioned seats, based on the total population (until 2003, the only Natives elected to the U.S. Congress were all Democrats with the backing of the party - six in total). Even if McCurtain influenced many Choctaws to become Republicans, they remained both racial and political minorities in the new Southern state of Oklahoma, and as such they were cast aside by the ruling White Democratic establishment.

In the short term, an FHM company helps an indebted consumer leave debt by using an established debt relief method. In the long-term, an FHM company provides resources to help its clients change their financial behavior and maintain their ‚Äúfinancial health‚Äù in the years after they leave debt. To reach this goal, a company provides resources, usually online, that can help both past and present clients better manage their finances. These resources might include savings tips, online budgeting tools or educational articles about credit and debt. These items are offered to encourage positive financial habits and help people avoid returning to debt in the future. History Financial health management evolved as part of the growing number of debt relief options that gained ground after federal bankruptcy laws were changed in 2005, making it more difficult for consumers to claim bankruptcy protection. Combined with a contemporaneous rise in debt levels, these trends led to the spread and development of other debt relief options, such as credit counseling, debt consolidation, and debt settlement. While these debt relief options were used by consumers to handle their immediate debt problems, a hole still existed once that debt was resolved. Debtors could fall back into the same patterns of behavior that placed them in debt in the first place. Financial health management originated in 2009 as a way to help consumer change these patterns and thereby stop falling back into debt. How it works Financial health management first aims to help people get out of immediate debt with an established debt relief method. In the case of FHM using debt settlement, a client makes monthly savings to an account until the balance rises high enough to reach a settlement with a creditor. The financial health management company would then negotiate a settlement deal with the creditor. The debt is then paid off from the saved funds. As a person goes through and finishes this process, he or she has access to resources provided by the company that can help them stay out of debt in the future. These resources, often online, include financial calculators, savings tips, and educational articles about credit and debt. Other articles can include topics such as psychology or health as it pertains to people going through the stress of debt. The client uses these resources to develop better spending and financial habits. Drawbacks A financial health management company uses established debt relief methods to handle each of its clients‚Äô debt, such as debt consolidation, debt settlement, and credit counseling. Each form of debt relief has its own possible setbacks. In the case of debt settlement, enrollment in a program does not stop creditors from taking legal action. In addition, a completed debt settlement program can cause a ding on a credit history.

Death   Battle with Sigurd the Mighty  Little is known of M√°el Brigte's life, but the story of his death is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga. According to this text, M√°el Brigte was challenged by Sigurd to a 40-man-a-side battle to \\"settle their differences\\". Treacherously, Sigurd brought 80 men to the fight, and M√°el Brigte knew he had been betrayed when he saw that each of Sigurd's horses had two men's legs on its flanks. M√°el Brigte exhorted his men to \\"kill at least one man before we die ourselves\\" and although a fierce fight ensued, M√°el Brigte was quickly defeated and killed.

The leg became inflamed and infected, and as a result Sigurd died.P√°lsson and Edwards (1981) \\"A poisoned tooth\\". pp. 27-28.  Legacy  The site of the battle is unknown. However the saga states that Earl Sigurd built a stronghold in the south of Moray, then a much larger province than todayPrior to 1130 the name \\"Moray\\" described a polity, far larger than the later county or district of the same name, (based at Elgin) which at its largest extended from Drumochter in the south to the Scandinavian held lands of Caithness and Sutherland in the north.

M√°el Brigte's power centre was probably in or near modern Inverness. In the 13th century a farm near Dornoch, now called Cyderhall is recorded as \\"Syvardhoch\\", meaning \\"Sigurd's mound\\". It is therefore possible that the battle was staged in Easter Ross somewhere between these two places. The landscape of Easter Ross The Orkneyinga Saga records few specific dates and was not written down until circa 1200, some three centuries after the events it recorded about M√°el Brigte and Sigurd took place. However it is thought that Sigurd Eysteinsson (aka \\"the Mighty\\"), ruled from about 875‚Äì92Ashley, pp. 440‚Äì441. so M√°el Brigte's death may have taken place in the last quarter of the 9th century.Some scholars believe that the Orkneyinga Saga reports of Harald I of Norway's expeditions are apocryphal and based on the later voyages of Magnus Barelegs. This would call into question the related tales of the early jarls of Orkney such as Sigurd Eysteinsson. See Thomson (2008) p. 24-27. There is no other record of M√°el Brigte's life. Although another of this name is described in the mid 11th century as being the father of the Mormaer M√°el Coluim of Moray.Thomson (2008) p. 77. Notes References *Ashley, Mike (1998).

The battleships would have been armed with ten guns and bring Japan closer to its goal of an \\"Eight-four\\" fleet (eight battleships and four battlecruisers). However, after the Washington Naval Conference and the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty, all work on the ship was halted. With the vessel required to be destroyed in accordance with the terms of the treaty, the incomplete Tosa was then subjected to various tests to gauge the effect of Japanese weaponry before being scuttled on 9 February 1925.

Tosa and her sister ship were intended to be the second set of high-speed battleships (after the ) under the plan, and were approved for construction in the Diet's 14 July 1917 warship-building authorization. Engineering blueprints for the two ships were completed by Japanese naval engineers in 1919. Based on Japanese studies of the British experience at the Battle of Jutland, the ships were to include new features over previous designs, including higher steaming speed despite increased tonnage, flush decks, and inclined armor.Watts, The Imperial Japanese Navy, 62Evans and Peattie, Kaigun, 171Lacroix, Japanese Cruisers, 14 Tosa was laid down on 16 February 1920 by Mitsubishi in Nagasaki.Friedman, \\"Japan\\", 232Garzke and Dulin, Battleships, 213Breyer, Battleships and battle cruisers, 350 She utilized the same slipway where, two decades later, the would be built.Breyer, Battleships of the World, 229 Tosa was originally scheduled to be launched in October 1921, but multiple strikes delayed it until November.Hall, \\"Professional Notes\\", 111 Ultimately, the battleship was not launched until 18 December 1921, two months behind schedule. Fitting-out commenced soon after with a projected completion date of July 1922.Watts, The Imperial Japanese Navy, 63 However, work on Tosa was halted on 5 February 1922, one day before Japan signed the Washington Naval Treaty. Under the terms of the treaty, construction of Tosa and Kaga was formally canceled on 5 May 1922.Evans and Peattie, Kaigun, 246Lacroix, Japanese Cruisers, 17 Career alt=A large and obviously unfinished ship surrounded by small tugboats belching smoke. In August 1922, Tosa was moved to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty thousand people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats.Yoshimura, Battleship Musashi, 11 The barbettes for the 406 mm (16 inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so the holes in the main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it contained only two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so heat could be supplied within the ship. Her guns were turned over to the Imperial Japanese Army for use as coastal artillery; one of her main gun turrets was installed near Busan, Korea, in 1930 and another on Tsushima Island in 1933.Gibbs, \\"Question 28/43,\\" 217 The rest of her guns were placed in reserve and ultimately scrapped in 1943.Gibbs and Tamura, \\"Question 58/80,\\" 192, 194 Tosa remained in Kure until mid-1924. Stricken on 1 April 1924, the ship‚Äîwith her hull virtually finished‚Äîwas designated for use in testing the effectiveness of shells and torpedoes against its armor arrangements.Garzke and Dulin, Battleships, 214 As a result, in June 1924 the navy's gunnery school took possession of the hull and prepared it for testing. Test target During 6‚Äì13 June, Tosa was subjected to five explosions. The first involved a Mk. I mine placed on the starboard side of the ship, below the waterline at frame 57. The resultant explosion ruptured about of hull, while dishing in another of plating. Flooding took 23 compartments within the ship, 17 quickly and five slowly; a total of of water entered the ship, increasing the ship's list to starboard by about ¬∞ 54'.Garzke and Dulin, Battleships, 214‚Äì216 The second and fifth test charges (8 and 13 June) were both placed near the fore main battery magazines. Involving larger charges than the first‚Äîabout (a 6th year type torpedo) and (a 9th year type mine)‚Äîthey were both placed at frame 87: the second to port and below the waterline, the fifth to starboard and below. Both broached the side protection system‚Äîallowing 1,008 and 726 long tons (1,024 and 738 t) of water, respectively, to enter the ship‚Äîshowing that the usual three-compartment, all- void system used in most Japanese battleships was an insufficient defense against modern torpedoes. The list incurred during test two was a ¬∞ 16' change, resulting in a port list of ¬∞ 36'; for test five these numbers were ¬∞ 38' and a starboard list of ¬∞ 48'. Similar to two and five, tests three and four were conducted at the same frame (192) but on opposite sides. Frame 192 was in the middle of the ship, where the ship's protection system was designed to be the strongest. Test three (9 June) was a 8th year type torpedo on the starboard side at a depth of under the ship's waterline; four (12 June) was a torpedo to port, below the waterline. The tests ruptured 15 and 26 m2 (160 and 280 sq ft), dished in 160 and 110 m2 (1,700 and 1,200 sq ft) of plating, and allowed 1,203 and 1,160 long tons (1,222 and 1,180 t) of water to enter the ship. Test three allowed in the most water of all the tests and, as a result, the list was altered from a previous port-side ¬∞ 51' to a starboard-side ¬∞ 22'‚Äîa change of ¬∞ 13'. Test four went from a starboard ¬∞ 0' to a port ¬∞ 20'. Further tests included the explosion of several Type 8 torpedoes filled with 300‚Äì346 kg (660‚Äì760 lbs) of picric acid within Tosas designed magazine for them, which was located forward of the first turret and had been considered a weak point in previous battleship designs. This caused \\"extreme structural damage above the waterline\\" to Tosa, and confirmed that any problem in that part of the ship could seriously harm it. Possible solutions included the installation of additional armor over the room or the use of walls on one side of the magazine that would be blown out and away from the ship in the event of any serious explosion inside. This would have the effect of focusing the explosion outside, minimizing structural damage to the ship itself. Another test involved the explosion of of TNT away from the side of the ship.Garzke and Dulin, Battleships, 214, 217Lacroix, Japanese Cruisers, 64 Another test conducted around this time involved a gun firing a shell at Tosa. It fell about short of the ship, but continued through the water and struck the ship near frame 228, below the designed waterline. The result was disturbing, as the shell was able to pass through the armor and explode in the port engine room. As a result, of water was let in, and Tosas list was increased from ¬∞ 53' to ¬∞ 06'.Lacroix and Wells, Japanese Cruisers of the Pacific War, 758‚Äì759 Results of the tests on Tosa were subsequently used in the refitting and reconstruction of existing warships. Lessons learned were also incorporated into the designs of the two super-battleships ten years later. In the latter, this meant that the side belt armor was continued below the waterline and beneath the torpedo bulge so that the class would have a defense against underwater shells.

Sinking Tosa being prepared for scuttling in Kure, January 31, 1925. For the next few months, Tosa was given to the Hiroshima gunnery school for use as a target.Garzke and Dulin, Battleships, 215 On 14 January 1925, the Navy Ministry of Japan ordered Tosa to be scuttled within one month's time. To ensure this, the Commander in Chief of the Kure Naval District directed that preparations for scuttling the ship be completed by 1 February. It was planned that Tosa would be scuttled on or before 10 February after being towed by the former battleship to a location south of the Mizunokojima Lighthouse and west of Okinoshima Island (located southwest of the present-day K≈çchi Prefecture).Lengerer, \\"Battleships of the Kaga Class\\", 89 Later that month, the United States Office of Naval Intelligence reported that \\"work on the dismantling of [Tosa] has been going on at the Kure Navy Yard and everything possible has been removed. The intention is to fill her hull with sand and gravel, tow her out to deep water near the entrance to Kure, open her sea cocks, and send her to the bottom.\\"Office of Naval Intelligence, \\"Monthly Information Bulletin\\" Tosa sinking stern-first, February 9, 1925. Tosa was brought from Kure on 3 February to Saiki Bay in the Bungo Channel.Jentschura, Warships, 35Lengerer, \\"Battleships of the Kaga Class\\", 89‚Äì90 She was then towed from the bay on the 6th with the intention of bringing the battleship to the designated sinking spot, but were thwarted by a strong storm and returned. A second attempt was made at 10:00 on the 8th. Explosive \\"mines\\" were embarked: two shells were placed inside Tosas double bottom, and two containers with of Shimose powder in each were put into the engine room on the port side. They would be detonated using electrical fuses, though time fuses were also fitted for use if the sea was calm. The explosives were triggered on the 8th, but they failed, so a contingent was sent aboard Tosa on the 9th; they opened six Kingston valves in the engine room at about 01:25. Soon after, Tosa slowly began to sink by the stern and to starboard. By 03:50, the rate increased, and the ship slipped beneath the waves by 07:00. Tosa was the tenth and final Japanese capital ship sunk or scrapped to comply with the naval treaty's stipulations.Fleischer, \\"Says Japan's Navy\\" See also * Hashima Island, also known as Gunkanjima (\\"Battleship Island\\"), received its nickname from an apparent resemblance to Tosa Notes References Bibliography   * Friedman, Norman. \\"Japan\\" in * \\"Appendix A; The Tosa Experiments\\" in    (contact the editor at lars.ahlberghalmstad.mail.postnet.se for subscription information)  * Category:Tosa-class battleships Category:Ships built in Japan Category:1921 ships Category:Ships sunk as targets Category:Shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean Category:Maritime incidents in 1925 ","title":"Japanese battleship Tosa"},{"id":"24472566","text":"Billon may refer to: * Billon (alloy), a metal alloy containing mostly copper or bronze with small quantity of silver. * Billon (company), a fintech company People *Nicolas Billon *Pierre Billon *Yves Billon *Jonathan Le Billon *Philippe Le Billon See also * Billion (disambiguation) ","title":"Billon"},{"id":"24472567","text":"The 1988 New South Wales Open was a tennis tournament played on grass courts at the NSW Tennis Centre in Sydney in Australia that was part of the 1988 Nabisco Grand Prix and of Tier IV of the 1988 WTA Tour.

It was based in the yard of the Boar's Head Inn. During its lifetime as a playhouse, it was home to the Earl of Derby's Men (summer 1599-summer 1601, summer 1602-March 1603), the Earl of Worcester's Men (summer 1601-summer 1602, April 1604‚Äì1605 or 1606), and Prince Charles's Men (summer 1609-March 1616); the historian Herbert Berry suggests that many other unidentified companies may have played there, as well.Berry, 106-131.  Location  The Boar's Head was located on the north side of Whitechapel High Street. Berry notes that \\"it became a playhouse partly because of where it was ‚Äî just outside the City of London ‚Ä¶ a few feet beyond the ordinary jurisdiction of the lord mayor and his aldermen\\". Until the end of the nineteenth century Boars Head Yard, named after the original inn, was a small alley running between Middlesex Street and Gulston Street, parallel to Whitechapel High Street and just to the northwest of Aldgate East station; Sisson, too, notes that this alley was just beyond the boundary of Portsoken Ward, and thus outwith the jurisdiction of the City.Sisson, pp.22‚Äì24Berry, 107  History  As Alexander Leggatt notes, the Boar's Head was originally an inn, which was built in the 1530s. Prior to 1598, the Boar's Head was simply an inn and did not include any formal playing space. However, it was being used as an extempore venue for plays at least as early as 1557, when an injunction from the Privy Council ordered the Lord Mayor of London to send officers to the Boar's Head to prevent the performance of \\"a lewd play called a Sack full of News\\", arrest the performers and confiscate the play-book. The Lord Mayor complied, but in a further letter on the following day the Privy Council ordered the prisoners' release. It underwent two renovations for use as a playhouse: first, in 1598, when a simple stage was erected, and a second, more elaborate renovation in 1599.Leggatt, 14-16. In 1616, the lease of the space to Oliver Woodliffe, one of the men responsible for expanding the theatre, expired, and Charles Sisson surmises that this marked the end of the Boar's Head's days as a theatre space.Sisson, 77. On 28 November 1594, Jane and Henry Poley, who owned the inn, entered a lease agreement with Oliver and Susan Woodliffe. The agreement began on 25 March 1595 and ended on 24 March 1616 and included a promise to spend ¬£100 during the following seven years to build, among other things, a tiring house and a stage.Sisson, 27. In 1598, a primitive stage was built in the middle of the yard, measuring by . The audience stood mostly in the yard, as the galleries were not big enough to accommodate a large audience. In 1599, Woodliffe and Richard Samwell (who had leased the inn in 1598 from Woodliffe; Woodliffe remained landlord of the theatre) took down the primitive stage setup and built a new playhouse apparently meant to compete with Shakespeare's Globe, which had just opened on the other side of the Thames. As Leggatt states, \\"the stage ‚Äî essentially the same stage ‚Äî was moved to the west wall so that actors could enter directly on to it from the tiring house, a roof was built over the stage, and the galleries were considerably expanded and roofed with tiles.\\"Leggatt, 14. Berry lists a number of plays that can be associated with the Boar's Head during its heyday, although he is careful to note that \\"we cannot show that any surviving plays were unquestionably written for performance at the Boar's Head.\\" He lists \\"two plays that may well have been written for performance at the Boar's Head\\": *A Pleasant conceited Comedie Wherein is shewed how a man may chuse a good Wife from a bad (London, 1602), sundry times Acted by the Earle of Worcesters Seruants.\\" *The History of the tryall of the Cheualry (London, 1605 twice), \\"lately acted by the right Honourable the Earle of Darby his seruants.\\" Also listed are six plays that are less likely to have been written specifically for performance at the Boar's Head but that were published as having belonged to the Queen's men and Prince Charles's men at the time of their respective stints at the Boar's Head: *Thomas Heywood, If you know not me, You know no bodie (London, 1605) *Heywood, The Second Part of, If you know now me, you know no bodie (London, 1606) *No-body and Some-body (London, n.d.), \\"acted by the Queens Maiesties Seruants\\" *Thomas Dekker and John Webster, The Famous History of Sir Thomas Wyat (London, 1607), \\"As it was plaied by the Queens Maiesties Seruants.\\" *The Fayre Mayed of the Exchange (London, 1607); often attributed to Heywood. *William Rowley and Thomas Middleton, A Faire Quarrell (London, 1617), \\"As it was Acted before the King and diuers times publikely by the Prince his Highnes Seruants.\\"Berry, pp. 124-125. In 1616, the lease agreement between the Woodliffes and the Poleys (now controlled by Mrs. Poley's heir, Sir John Poley) expired. By this time, the Prince's Men had merged with Lady Elizabeth's Men and had entered into an agreement to play in the Hope Theatre on Bankside. Sisson suggests that Poley \\"found it more profitable to develop the buildings and site of the Boar's head, or to dispose of it to a speculator, for other purposes than those of an inn and a theatre, in the rapid growth of this residential and industrial suburb of London.\\".Sisson, 77.Berry has since found more evidence to corroborate Sisson's suggestion, and discusses at length the disposal of the property at the hands of Sir John Poley (pp. 76-83).  Layout  As Berry explains, the Boar's Head differed from many other playhouses of the time in that it \\"was not a single free-standing building, like the Globe, Fortune, and others, but, except for the stage, mostly a scheme of additions and alterations to existing buildings originally meant for very different uses.\\"Berry, 95. These other sections included various lodgings, stables, gardens, barns, and, thankfully for its customers, a privy.Berry, 107; 139-155. The Boar's Head featured a covered, square playing area in an age of polygonal playhouses (such as the Globe, the Swan and the Rose) and was surrounded on all sides by the audience. Even after its expansion, the Boar's Head remained a comparatively small theatre for its time, with only two levels of galleries on the east side, and one each on the north and south sides.

Life and career Vasily Pronin was born into a peasant family in the village of Pavlovo in Ryazan guberniya. As a young man, he earned his living by working as a farm laborer, repairman at the Nizhny Novgorod Railway, switcher at the Moscow Railway, and factory turner. In 1925, Pronin joined the ranks of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and engaged himself in Komsomol and party activities. Later on he graduated from the Institute of Red Professors and moved to Tuva on a party assignment. In 1938, Vasily Pronin was appointed secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party and then became chairman of the Executive Committee of the Moscow City Council in April 1939. Vasily Pronin contributed significantly to the fulfillment of the General Plan for the Reconstruction of Moscow. In 1939-1940, they rid the capital of seasonality in housing development, introduced the method of rapid-flow construction, and commenced large-scale multi-storey housing development throughout the city. By 1941, they had constructed 13 massive bridges and 45 km of granite embankments and doubled the capacity of water-supply network. Under Pronin's supervision, they strengthened the capital's anti-aircraft defense, built and reinforced bomb shelters, adjusted the Moscow metro for the needs of sheltering of population in case of air raids, and conducted civil defense drills around the city. In the summer of 1940, Vasily Pronin was awarded the Order of Lenin for his success in constant developing and improvement of the municipal services of Moscow. From the first days of the Great Patriotic War, Moscow City Council and its Executive Committee aimed all of its efforts at the mobilization, reserve training for the Red Army, and translation of the State Defense Committee‚Äôs decisions into production of ammunition, weapons, and military outfit. They rebuilt the defense industry in Moscow after the evacuation of several factories inland. By the early December 1940, 654 factories out of 670 in direct subordination to the Moscow City Council had already been producing ammunition and weapons. Vasily Pronin personally participated in coordination of work of 50 factories, producing components for the Katyusha multiple rocket launchers and ammunition. In August 1941, they completed the government contract in record short time and sent the first sets of the Katyushas to the front. Also, Pronin took part in organizing militias and other volunteer formations, evacuating equipment and people, constructing a fortified belt along the distant approaches and outskirts of Moscow, and improving the anti- aircraft defense. Vasily Pronin was also in charge of the mining of Moscow, most of which would have been blown up in case of German occupation. As a member of the Military Council of the Moscow Military District and Moscow Zone of Defense, Vasily Pronin together with the first secretary of the Moscow City Council and Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party Alexander Shcherbakov rendered great assistance to the State Defense Committee and Western Front command in organizing the defense of the capital in the fall and winter of 1941. In late 1944, Pronin was appointed first deputy chairman of the Council of the People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR. Later in his life, he held different posts, such as deputy minister and minister of several all-union and republican ministries. Vasily Pronin was elected deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and RSFSR and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. In 1957, Vasily Pronin was forced to retire at the age of 52 as a result of Nikita Khrushchev's campaign to purge the party of Joseph Stalin's associates. He died in 1993 in Moscow.

In between she was instrumental in the seizure of the Danish island of Anholt, captured prizes in the Channel during the Napoleonic Wars, sailed to the East Indies and South America, participated in the suppression of the slave trade, and served as a prison hulk in Gibraltar before she was sold in 1884. Active duty Captain William Selby, late of , took command of Owen Glendower in January 1809. 1803 plan of an Apollo-class frigate The Gunboat War Early in May 1809, Vice-admiral Sir James Saumarez, the British commander-in-chief in the Baltic, sent a squadron, consisting of the 64-gun third rate , Owen Glendower, three sloops (, , and ), and the gun-brig . The commander of the squadron was Captain Aiskew Paffard Hollis, captain of Standard. Their objective was to capture the Danish island of Anholt. Anholt was small and essentially barren; its significance rested in the lighthouse that stood on its easternmost point. The Danes had extinguished it at the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Denmark; the point of capturing the island was to restore the lighthouse to its function to assist British men-of-war and merchantmen in the Kattegat.James (1827) Vol. 5, 130. The task force landed a party of seamen and marines, under the command of Selby, assisted by Captain Edward Nicolls of the Standard's Royal Marines. The Danes put up a short, ineffective resistance that killed one British marine and wounded two. Still, on 18 May the Danish garrison of 170 men surrendered, giving the British immediate possession of the island. The Channel From late 1809 Owen Glendower operated in the Channel. On 10 March 1810, she came upon a French privateer lugger while her crew was boarding a schooner. Selby chased the lugger for one and half hours. The lugger resisted until she was half full of water and had had two men killed and three wounded out of her crew of 58. She turned out to be Camille, armed with only six of the fourteen guns she carried, having stored eight in her hold. She had sailed from Cherbourg only six hours earlier and had already captured the English schooner Fame, of London, William Proper, master, which had been sailing from Lisbon to London with a cargo of fruit. later recaptured Fame. On 26 March Owen Glendower sailed with a convoy for Quebec. On 27 September she sailed with a convoy for the Cape of Good Hope. Then on 1 October Owen Glendower, with in company, was escorting a convoy off The Lizard in thick fog. A master and crew from Roden, one of the vessels in the convoy, came aboard and advised Selby that a French privateer cutter had taken his vessel. When the fog lifted, it turned out that the cutter was only a short distance away. The cutter did not surrender until a short cannonade wounded several of her crew. She turned out to be the 16 or 20-gun Indomptable, out of Roscoff, with a crew of 120 or 130 men.The Gentleman's Magazine (November 1810), Vol. 80 Part 2, p.466. She had formerly been the Revenue Cutter Swan, out of Cowes.Lloyd's List,‚Ññ4499. Selby also retook Roden. Selby died aboard Owen Glendower on 28 March 1811 whilst at the Cape of Good Hope .The gentleman's magazine, and historical chronicle, Volume 81, Part 1, p.596. Edward Henry A'Court, newly promoted to Post-captain on 29 March, took temporary command of Owen Glendower. He then sailed her back to Britain. Captain Bryan Hodgson replaced him as captain in July. East Indies Owen Glendowers next cruise was to the East Indies. She was due to leave Portsmouth on 25 September 1811, but adverse winds detained her. She sailed five days later, only to be driven back to Falmouth. Finally, she sailed for India on 20 October. In 1812 she served as flagship for Vice Admiral Sir Samuel Hood in the East Indies. In May 1814 off the Nicobar Islands, Owen Glendower captured a U.S. privateer, the 12 or 16-gun vessel Hyder Ally, which had a crew of 30.Niless Weekly Register, 15 February 1815, 400. Hyder Ally was out of Portland, Maine and under the command of Captain Israel Thorndike. She carried sixteen cannons: twelve 18-pounder carronades, two 18-pounder guns, and two 9-pounder guns. Apparently some of her armament came from . Hyder Ally had already taken two prizes, which she had sent back to the US. (The British later intercepted both and retook them. The British privateer Tom captured the first at Cape Elizabeth, Maine. A British naval vessel took the other at Mount Desert Island.) Earlier, Hyder Ally had escaped after being chased for three days by . Owen Glendower cruised the East Indies, stopping at such places as the Malacca Roads (21 August), Madras (29 August 1815), Penang and China, Trincomalee, and the like. She returned to England in the spring of 1816 and was laid up in May at Chatham. Post-war Between March 1817 and May 1819, Owen Glendower underwent major repairs at Chatham. She then was fitted for sea between June and October. South America Captain the Honorable Robert Cavendish Spencer took command of Owen Glendower in August 1819. He brought with him nearly all the officers and 18 young gentlemen from his previous command, . Owen Glendower was nominally ready for sea, but Spencer found the reality less compelling. He therefore spent two and a half months re-rigging and re-fitting. He also discharged about a fifth of his crew and lost about the same proportion to sickness and desertion.Phillips, Michael ‚Äì Owen Glendower Owen Glendower sailed for South America on 16 November. She arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 19 December after a record 33-day voyage that included a 24-hour stop in Funchal, Madeira. She then sailed for Montevideo and Buenos Aires where Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy was waiting to make her his flagship. She stayed in Buenos Aires for some time, but then sailed to St Helena on a fact-finding mission to report on the conditions under which Napoleon was living while in captivity. Contemporary accounts stress that Spencer's political affiliations were such that he would have been ready to find fault; instead, his report affirmed that Napoleon was well treated, though Napoleon chose not to grant Spencer an audience. While Owen Glendower was away on this mission, Hardy transferred his flag to . Owen Glendower rounded Cape Horn despite bad weather and arrived in Valparaiso on 22 January 1821. Spencer was under orders to find Captain William Henry Shirreff of Andromache, who was a close friend of Lord Cochrane. (Cochrane was commander of the insurgent Chilean Navy in the fight for Chile's independence form Spain). Shirreff had ignored three previous recall messages and Spencer's orders were to arrest Shirreff if he continue to prove recalcitrant. The reason behind the recall was that Spain had complained that Shirreff had not maintained a strict neutrality.Vale (2001), p.22. Hardy, in Creole, joined Spencer at Valparaiso. Spencer found Andromache off Peru and Shirreff agreed, without a fuss, to return to Britain. Owen Glendower then spent three months off Spanish Peru, during which she visited the Galapagos Islands. One of her midshipmen was Robert FitzRoy, who, as captain of , would take Charles Darwin there in 1834.Gribbin and Gribbin (2003), pp.24&30. While Owen Glendower was at Callao, the Chilean fleet attacked the port. However, Cochrane's forces were not strong enough and he was forced to retire. During the attack, Spencer moved Owen Glendower to expose a Chilean vessel that had tried to take cover behind her. Blockade succeeded where force had not, and Spain entered into negotiations with the rebels. The negotiations took place on Owen Glendower. These negotiations continued after Spencer's recall and were completed on board ; the negotiations resulted in the formation of the Republic of Peru. Owen Glendower sailed for home with freight worth about ¬£400,000. Off the Azores they encountered an American ship from Smyrna that had exhausted its food and water. Spencer provided some and told them that they were only a few hours away from Flores. Owen Glendower arrived at Spithead on 19 January 1822. The Eastern Atlantic Owen Glendower underwent a refit that included rebuilding the stern that Sir Robert Sepping had given her. Spencer then sailed her, with his father, Earl Spencer, to Copenhagen to invest the Danish King with the Order of the Garter. Two or three weeks later she was at Falmouth to determine its longitude. She then sailed to Madeira to determine Funchal‚Äôs longitude. Owen Glendower then was paid off at Chatham. Another midshipman on Owen Glendower at about this time who later came to be of note was Richard Brydges Beechey. He would go on to reach the rank of Rear Admiral. He was also a painter, and son and brother of painters. Fighting the slave trade Cape Coast Castle Portrait of Cheesman Henry Binstead, 1826, from the Royal Naval Museum In October 1821, the Admiralty appointed Captain Sir Robert Mends to the West Africa Squadron as Commodore and Senior Officer on the west coast of Africa, to be employed in the suppression of the slave trade. He commissioned Owen Glendower in November 1822. On 16 June 1823, Owen Glendower seized the Spanish slave schooner Concheta. Returning to Africa following an outbreak of yellow fever, Mends defended the Cape Coast against the threatened attack by the Ashanti. It was during this operation that he fell ill with cholera. He died three days later on 4 September. On 5 September the boats of the Owen Glendower seized the Spanish slave schooner Fabiana. Lieutenant Pringle Stokes temporarily took command of the ship. Hearing of the death of Sir Robert Mends, Commander John Filmore, who had recently arrived on the African Station, appointed himself to command the station and transferred to the Owen Glendower. On 8 February 1824 marines from Owen Glendower defended Cape Coast Castle following the Ashanti defeat of government forces: two marines and a Krooman were killed and two marines and five seamen from the ship wounded.Also Krouman or Kruman. This was the term for an ex-slave, rescued from West Africa and locally recruited into the Royal Navy. The Navy used it as a title, such as \\"Krooman Jim Freeman\\", or \\"Head Krouman Jim Freeman\\". Thereafter the vessel visited ports along the coast where the Ashanti might have been taking refuge. A letter dated 16 March 1824 from Major J. Chisholm, administrator of the colonial government and commander of the British troops on the Gold Coast, praised Owen Glendower and Captain Woolcombe for her role in suppressing unrest and possible insurrection at Elmina. On 19 May 1824 Owen Glendower, under Captain Prickett, who also commanded the Naval Squadron, landed seamen and marines to occupy the forts on the coast while the army moved against the Ashanti. One of the officers on Owen Glendower during her time with the West Africa Squadron was Cheesman Henry Binstead. He served as an Admiralty Midshipman and later as an acting Lieutenant. He is most noted for the diaries that he kept, which detail life on the squadron. They record frustrations, slave ships chased and captured, fears of attack and imprisonment, impressions of the indigenous African people, and effects of ill-health and fever on the ship's men. When Owen Glendower finally returned to England, Binstead was one of the few of her original crew to have survived. From October 1824 to February 1825, Owen Glendower was back at Chatham, undergoing refitting. There Captain Hood Hanway Christian commissioned her for the Africa station, where he would serve as Commodore. Cape of Good Hope From early 1825 to early 1827, Owen Glendower was based at the Cape of Good Hope. On 10 March 1826, 19 sailors from Owen Glendower drowned in a boating accident at Simon's Bay when her pinnace swamped.Roth et al. (1906), p.257. After another trip to England via St Helena, she was paid off at Chatham in July. Between December 1828 and December 1829, Owen Glendower was at Chatham, again undergoing repairs. Gibraltar In March 1842 Owen Glendower was in Chatham, being fitted as a prison hulk to be based at Gibraltar. > She then sailed from Chatham for Gibraltar in October with 200 convicts for work on the development of the Dockyard and the construction of a new breakwater there. Among the convicts were some who had run afoul of the restrictive political laws of the time, such as the Tolpuddle Martyrs. Once in Gibraltar, Owen Glendower then served for decades as a convict hulk. Fate In 1876 Gibraltar abolished the Convict Establishment and Owen Glendower, which had been operating as the convicts‚Äô hospital, became a receiving ship. In 1884 she was sold to F. Danino at Gibraltar,Colledge, p. 254. for ¬£1036. Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References  *Ellis, James H. (2009) A Ruinous and Unhappy War: New England and the War of 1812.

He joined the fascio in Florence in 1922 and was appointed consul in the local militia the following year. From early on he was associated with the intransigenti tendency within fascism, favouring the violence of the squadrons as a means to achieve fascism.Nicholas Farrell, Mussolini: A New Life, Phoenix, 2004, p. 154 As a squadron leader he garnered a reputation for extreme violence and in October 1925 he was dismissed and sent to Tripolitania for this reason. At the time Florence had become a by-word for the excesses of fascist violence and as a result Mussolini removed a number of leading party men in the city as he sought to normalize Italy under his control.Farrell, Mussolini, p. 171 He was brought back in September 1926 as part of a delegation to the League of Nations before being given command of the Milizia Nazionale Forestale, an arm of the Blackshirts devoted to forestry. Back in favour, Tamburini was given the role of prefetto of Avellino in 1936, switching to the same position in Ancona in 1939, then Trieste in 1941. Following the establishment of the Italian Social Republic Tamburini was appointed chief of police on 1 October 1943.

Tamburini soon became a figure of suspicion for the Germans, who believed him to be in secret contact with the Allies, and in February he was sent to Dachau concentration camp by General Karl Wolff. In the end Tamburini was only briefly in Dachau and soon returned to Italy, although he was then sent to prison in his homeland for his involvement in the fascist regime.

Burnet said of him, \\"The keenest blade on the field of San Jacinto is broken.\\" He died a bachelor on December 17, 1838, while serving as a member of the Texas Congress. His nephew, John A. Wharton, who would go on to be a Confederate Army general, was named for him.  Early life  John Austin Wharton was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in April 1806. He became an orphan in 1816 and was raised, along with his four siblings by his uncle Jesse Wharton who ensured that he received a classical education. His older brother, William H. Wharton, preceded him in immigrating to colonial Texas in 1827. John Austin Wharton arrived in Texas between 1829 and 1833.Handbook of Texas OnlineSouthwestern Historical Quarterly Online, Volume 19, No.3  In Texas  Upon arrival in Texas, Wharton became an agitator for Texas Independence from Mexico. He participated in conventions and consultations which led to Texas declaring independence from Mexico on March 2, 1836. He also formed one of the first Freemason lodges in Texas.  Hero of San Jacinto  Previously, in December 1835, Sam Houston had appointed Wharton as Texas's agent in New Orleans to procure supplies for the coming conflict; and was responsible for bringing the cannons known as the \\"Twin Sisters\\" to the Texian army. Wharton was later appointed Adjutant General on Houston's staff. Wharton fought bravely during the Battle of San Jacinto, where Mexican strongman Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana was captured. Wharton was recognized by Texas' Secretary of War Thomas Rusk for his service. Wharton also served as Secretary of War of the nascent Republic of Texas in 1836.  After Texas' independence  Wharton was elected to the Texas Congress, which was meeting in Houston in 1836 and served until 1837, chairing the Education Committee.

Gilbert in about 1878 The Ne'er-do-Weel is a three-act drama written by the English dramatist W. S. Gilbert. It is the second of three plays that he wrote at the request of the actor Edward Sothern. The story concerns Jeffery Rollestone, a gentleman who becomes a vagabond after Maud, the girl he loves, leaves him. He meets Gerard, an old school chum who arranges for him to have a good post. Jeffery returns the favour by sacrificing to try to help Gerard marry Maud (Gerard needs the marriage for financial reasons), even though Jeffery and Maud still love each other. The play opened at London's Olympic Theatre on 25 February 1878. The play was poorly received, and Gilbert withdrew it after six performances. Critics felt that the play inappropriately combined sentimental scenes with comedy. Gilbert rewrote and restaged the piece three weeks later and renamed it The Vagabond. Although these changes brought a better reception, the play was not a success and closed within a month. Soon afterwards, however, Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore opened, followed by a decade of extraordinarily successful Savoy operas. Background By the time he wrote The Ne'er-do-Weel, W. S. Gilbert had produced 50 previous works for the theatre and was one of England's leading playwrights.Knight, p. 206 Successes the previous year had included a comedy, Engaged, and a comic opera with composer Arthur Sullivan, The Sorcerer. Comic actor Edward Sothern had asked Gilbert, in 1875, to write a play for him. Gilbert was unable to complete that play on time, but Sothern asked Gilbert to be ready with a play by October 1876 that would feature him in a serious role with comic scenes.Ainger, pp. 117‚Äì20Stedman, p. 140 Gilbert wrote the play, Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith, but when the play opened at the Haymarket Theatre in September 1876, Hermann Vezin took the title role instead of Sothern, in a cast featuring the young actor Johnston Forbes-Robertson and the 19-year-old Marion Terry, sister of the famous actress Ellen Terry.Ainger, p. 123 Genesis Meanwhile, Gilbert had already been working on another play for Sothern, The Ne'er-do-Weel, presumably to be produced at the Haymarket.Stedman, pp. 137‚Äì38 and 140Head, p. 66 Gilbert wanted to use a pseudonym because he would not personally direct the play, but Sothern thought that the piece would do better with Gilbert's name attached.Ainger, p. 124 Sothern corresponded frequently with Gilbert and had many requirements and suggestions for the piece in terms of length, setting and number of characters, among other things, that \\"the seriousness should be brightened up with comedy\\" and that an important part of the plot should be a \\"story of a man making some great sacrifice for the girl he madly loves\\".Head, pp. 65‚Äì66 Sothern's conflicting requests for dramatic and comic situations made it difficult for Gilbert to write an internally consistent play. Henry Neville's programme note withdrawing The Ne'er-do-Weel at Gilbert's request In July 1876, Gilbert sent an outline of the plot to Sothern. Gilbert noted that it would be difficult to put much comedy into the play. In August, Sothern replied, partly approving the plot sketch, but worrying about how the love story would play out.Head, pp. 66‚Äì67 Sothern also became concerned that, because Gilbert had made the play's heroine a widow rather than a virgin, audiences would not be sympathetic to her. Sothern requested that the husband die of a heart attack immediately after their wedding, so that she might remain in a state of innocence.The Ne'er-do-Weel, Precious Nonsense ‚Äì the newsletter of the Midwestern Gilbert & Sullivan Society, Issue 42 (May 1995), online at The Gilbert and Sullivan ArchiveHead, p. 67 Gilbert resisted this suggestion, and when he sent a draft of the script in January 1877, Sothern was not pleased with the work and offered to forfeit his rights in it, letting Gilbert keep 500 pounds as the forfeiture fee. He had already paid Gilbert 2,000 guineas for the play, and Gilbert was unable immediately to pay him back, having just purchased a new house. After further discussions, in March 1877 Sothern asked Gilbert to revise the piece, renewing his request that the widow be a maiden.Head, p. 68 Despite various rewrites, Sothern continued to be dissatisfied with the piece, and in July 1877, he asked Gilbert to take it back, now offering him a forfeiture fee of 1,000 guineas. Gilbert felt bad about holding Sothern to this bargain, and in August 1877, he suggested that he have someone else produce the play and pay Sothern back from any profits up to the full 2,000 guineas. Sothern agreed.Ainger, p. 134 Gilbert arranged for Henry Neville, lessee of London's Olympic Theatre, to produce The Ne'er-do- Weel, and rehearsals began in January 1878.Ainger, p. 148 Neville played the role written for Sothern, and the cast again featured Johnston Forbes- Robertson as well as Gilbert's protege, Marion Terry.Stedman, pp. 155‚Äì57 Programme for The Vagabond for 30 March 1878 The Ne'er-do-Weel opened at the Olympic Theatre on 25 February 1878. It was poorly received, and the critics found fault with Gilbert's combination of melodrama and comedy in the same play.Knight, p. 207 For example, The Times review lamented that Gilbert introduced into passages of \\"real human passion and ... real human feeling, some grotesque turn of thought, or extravagance of whim painfully at variance with the spirit of the scene, and which ... is unable to provoke laughter for its own sake\\".Head, p. 63 For example, in one scene Richard Quilt, the villain of the piece, is tied hand and foot by the hero, whom he threatens. Then he hops off the stage, still bound. Gilbert withdrew the play after only six performances, and Neville printed a note (pictured above) in the programme of the next production at the Olympic acknowledging the poor reception of the second half of the piece, promising to offer a rewritten piece \\"with the least delay possible\\" and begging the excuse that writing \\"an entirely original play\\" in English was a difficult task.Moss, Simon. Sir William Schwenck Gilbert archive at Gilbert & Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia The Vagabond and aftermath After some delay due to an attack of the gout and Gilbert's busy schedule, he rewrote the piece (particularly the third act), mostly to remove some of the comic episodes and to take out the character of Richard Quilt.Ainger, pp. 151‚Äì52Head, p. 70 It reopened at the Olympic as The Vagabond on 25 March 1878 and received a kinder reception by both audiences and critics.Stedman, p. 157 One critic wrote that, although the piece was now more successful, it was hardly worthwhile to revise the piece: \\"It can never hope ... to occupy a place with its author's best work having neither the strength nor the shapeliness of the plays by which Mr Gilbert is known and judged.\\"Knight, p. 213 Other reviews criticised Gilbert for his \\"failure... to acknowledge the public verdict\\".\\"English Plays and Actors: Lessons in Perseverance. Ups and Downs of Dramatists\\", The New York Times, 15 April 1878, p. 5 The play ran for about 23 performances, until 18 April 1878.Moss, Simon. \\"The Ne'er-do-Weel\\" at Gilbert & Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia, c20th.com, accessed 16 November 2009See theatre programme from The Vagabond, Olympic Theatre, 17 April, and theatre programme dated 22 April 1878 for Jealousy by Charles Reade at the Olympic. See also, Ainger, p. 155. Although the piece was disappointing, Gilbert was soon to score the biggest triumph of his career, with H.M.S. Pinafore, which opened exactly three months after The Ne'er-do-Weel.Stedman, p. 160 After the play failed, there were no profits with which Gilbert could pay Sothern back at least the 1,000 guineas above the forfeiture fee. He offered to pay it back in instalments over three years, and Sothern graciously accepted. Gilbert also licensed Sothern to mount American productions of Gilbert's 1877 comic success, Engaged, and he also eventually wrote a new play for Sothern, Foggerty's Fairy.Ainger, pp. 134‚Äì35 and 166 The next year, in 1879, Neville produced another Gilbert drama at the Olympic, Gretchen, but that, too, was a failure.Stedman, p. 165 Afterwards, Gilbert concentrated on the highly profitable Savoy operas, writing only a few more plays during the rest of his life.List of Gilbert's Plays at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive Characters and original cast * Jeffery Rollestone, a vagabond ‚Äì Henry Neville * Mr. Seton, of Drumferry ‚Äì Mr. Flockton * Gerard Seton, Lieutenant, R.N, his son ‚Äì Johnston Forbes-Robertson * Maud Callendar, Gerard Seton's wealthy cousin ‚Äì Marion Terry * Richard Quilt, Mr. Seton's ex-secretary ‚Äì Robert Pateman * Captain O'Hara, a retired merchant-sailor ‚Äì George W.

Substantial changes were made before the play was revived as The Vagabond. ;Act I Richard Quilt is romantically interested in Jessie O'Hara. But Jessie, in turn, is in love with Gerard Seton and rejects Richard's advances. Richard has recently been discharged as secretary to Gerard's father because of dishonesty in his accounts. Gerard is fond of Jessie, but his family situation requires that he must marry a wealthy woman, and so he plans to marry his cousin, a wealthy young widow, Maud Callendar. Maud is staying with the Seton family in their ancestral home, Drumferry. Gerard tries to hire a passing vagabond to pose as a model for a sketch he is working on. The vagabond, Jeffery Rollestone, turns out to be Gerard's old school chum. The well-born and talented Jeffery sank into a life of \\"poverty and wretchedness\\" after the girl he loved deserted him, at her family's request, to marry another man. Gerard offers Jeffery a post as his father's secretary, since that position is now available, and Jeffery repents of his misdeeds. Gerard approaches Maud to propose, but she regards him as a brother. Maud is the woman who had broken Jeffery's heart, and the two suppress their emotions. ;Act II Six weeks later, Jeffery is enjoying working for pleasant Mr. Seton. The Setons are deep in debt, however, and without an advantageous marriage for Gerard, they will lose Drumferry. Mr. Seton asks Jeffery to try to help Gerard persuade Maud to marry him. Jeffery, though in love with Maud, approaches her to speak for Gerard. Maud is hurt that he, who once loved her, could urge her to marry another man. She declares that she still loves him, and he returns the declaration; they renew their engagement. When Mr. Seton finds out what has happened, he furiously fires Jeffery. Before Jeffery can leave, Richard Quilt sneaks into the Seton home to steal some love letters from Jessie to Gerard, planning blackmail. Jeffery takes the letters from him, except for one, which Richard manages to hide. He ties Richard up and questions him, but lets him go (hopping away still bound), planning to give the letters to Gerard. Richard, however, is stopped by a porter, and the hidden letter from Jessie, addressed to \\"My dear, dear friend\\", is found. Jessie's uncle, Captain O'Hara, assumes that Jessie wrote the letter to Gerard. Maud has returned and says that, if Jessie wrote the letter to Gerard, she will never speak to Gerard again. To Maud's horror, however, Jeffery, who wants to help Gerard because of his kindnesses to him) declares that the letter is meant for him. Mr. Seton is grateful. ;Act III The bumbling Captain O'Hara, who has recently become a magistrate, must question Richard about the accusation of burglary. His prisoner must assist O'Hara in following the applicable legal terms and procedures, which is helpful to Richard in his defence. O'Hara attacks Jeffery for supposedly romancing his niece. Jeffery takes all the blame and says that the niece is faultless. He agrees to marry Jessie, although he does not know her name. Maud wants to forgive Jeffery, but he says nothing in his own defence. Jessie has travelled to London with Gerard, but now Gerard returns and is angry with Jeffery for having proposed to Maud. But Jeffery explains that he only claimed to be the addressee of Jessie's letter to help Gerard marry Maud. Unfortunately, Gerard has now married Jessie. Fortunately, however, Mr. Seton's wealthy cousin has just died suddenly, and he now has financial security. Jeffery and Gerard reconcile, and Jessie reconciles with her uncle. Maud returns, having found out what is going on, and she and Jeffery happily pair off. See also * List of W. S. Gilbert dramatic works Notes References * Ainger, Michael.

It is found in Asia, the Caribbean, North America and Europe. The fruit bodies, or mushrooms, of the fungus grow on dead twigs and other woody debris of forest floors, especially along streams and other wet places. They have small orange-red caps, up to in diameter, held by slender yellowish stems up to long. The gills are pale yellow with a whitish edge. Several other Mycena species look similar, but may be distinguished by differences in size and/or microscopic characteristics. M. acicula is considered inedible because of its small size. Taxonomy First named Agaricus acicula by the German scientist Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer in 1774, the species was also referred to as Agaricus miniatus by another German, naturalist August Batsch. It was given its current name in 1871 by Paul Kummer. Rolf Singer transferred the species to the genera Hemimycena and Marasmiellus, but the binomials resulting from these transfers are now considered synonyms. The fungus is classified in the section Aciculae of the genus Mycena. The specific epithet acicula is derived from the Latin word meaning \\"small needle\\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"orange bonnet\\", or the \\"coral spring Mycena\\". Description Close-up of pruinose (powdery) cap surface The cap is initially convex, but as it matures, it expands to a bell-shape, typically reaching in diameter. The cap sometimes has a small abrupt umbo (a central bump), and the cap margin is pressed closely against the stem when young, often flaring or curving slightly inward. As the cap expands, a narrow sterile (i.e., without any reproductive cells typical of the hymenium) band which frequently becomes lobed or irregularly-jagged often forms at the extreme margin. The cap surface is smooth, faintly translucent- striate when moist, at first pruinose but soon naked. The color is red when young, soon becoming yellowish toward the margin, and slowly fading to bright orange-yellow. The flesh is thin, brittle, yellow, and has no distinctive odor or taste. The gills are adnate (with gills broadly attached to the stem, slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem) or slightly rounded next to the stem. The individual gills are close to subdistant, with between 10‚Äì14 reaching the stem, and two or three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem). The gills are moderately broad, pale orange to whitish, often yellowish at the base and whitish along the edges. The stem is long, and up to 1 mm thick; flexuous (winding from side to side), brittle, with the base covered with sharp, straight, and stiff white hairs. The surface is densely white-pruinose initially, but soon becomes naked with a subsequent color shift to orange-yellow or lemon yellow. This species has been described as \\"a delight to behold\\", but \\"one usually has to get down on hands and knees to find it!\\" The fruit bodies of Mycena acicula are considered inedible, as they are too small and insubstantial to be considered for consumption. Microscopic characteristics The spores are roughly spindle-shaped (i.e., tapering at each end), with dimensions of 9‚Äì11 by 3.5‚Äì4.5 ¬µm. They are nonamyloid, meaning they do not take up iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club- shaped, four-spored and measure 20‚Äì22 by 5‚Äì6 ¬µm. The cheilocystidium and pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the edge and face, respectively, of a gill) are similar, club-shaped to spindle-shaped or egg-shaped, and have apices that are often covered with a resinous secretion.Smith, p.119‚Äì21. The hyphae that comprise the cap cuticle are up to 3.5 ¬µm wide, clamped, and covered with cylindrical excrescences that measure 2‚Äì9 by 1‚Äì3 ¬µm. The hyphae of the cortical layer of the stem are up to 4.5 ¬µm wide, clamped, and densely covered with simple to somewhat branched, cylindrical to inflated excrescences that are up to 20 by 5 ¬µm. These latter excrescences are embedded in gelatinous matter. Similar species Mycena adonis, , and are larger species of the section Adonidae in the genus Mycena. In that section, among other differences, the hyphae of the cortical layer (the outer layer of tissue) of the stem are smooth. is similar in appearance to M. acicula, but the cap is yellower, the gills are broadly adnate or decurrent with a short tooth, the gill edge is orange to bright yellow, and the stem is dry, not sticky. The hyphae of the cortical layer of the stem are smooth and not embedded in gelatinous matter, and in European collections the basidia are two-spored and do not have clamps. , a North American and European species, looks similar with its orange cap, but may be distinguished microscopically by the cheilocystidia which are densely covered by excrescences; it also has a larger cap, up to . can be distinguished by the reddish-orange cap which tends to become paler at the margin. Mycena specialist Alexander H. Smith further noted of M. acicula that it could readily be mistaken for a Hygrophorus. Habitat and distribution Typical growth habit The fruit bodies of Mycena acicula grow singly, in groups, or somewhat clustered on debris in wet places, especially along streams or the borders of swamps. The appearance of the fruit bodies is not significantly influenced by the effect of rainfall, perhaps because \\"such minute fungi are largely determined by the microenvironment prevailing under dense vegetation, etc., which is no doubt less affected by recent rain than more exposed situations.\\" The fungus is widely distributed throughout the eastern United States and Canada and occurs in Washington, Oregon, and California along the Pacific Coast. It has also been reported from Trinidad, Britain, Norway, Spain, Korea, and the Ussuri River Valley in the northeast of China.

Found in Asia, Europe, and North America, it produces small orangish to reddish inedible mushrooms with caps up to in diameter, held by thin pinkish-white stems reaching long. The fungus prefers to grow in conifer woods and peat bogs, suggesting a preference for acidic environments. The appearance of several atypical fruitings of Mycena adonis on deciduous wood in the Netherlands in the late 1970s was attributed to increases in atmospheric pollution that raised the acidity of the wood substrate. Mushrooms resembling M. adonis include M. acicula, M. aurantiidisca, and M. rosella. Taxonomy The species was first named Agaricus adonis in 1792 by Jean Baptiste Fran√ßois Pierre Bulliard, and placed in Mycena by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821. Rolf Singer successively moved it to Hemimycena (1943), then Marasmiellus (1951). Singer later changed his mind about these placements, and his 1986 Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, he considered the species a Mycena; the binomials resulting from the prior generic transfers are synonyms. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"scarlet bonnet\\". Samuel Frederick Gray called it the \\"Adonis high-stool\\" in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British Plants, while Mordecai Cubitt Cooke named it the \\"delicate Mycena\\". Description The gills are interspersed with two or three tiers of short gills. The cap initially has a sharply conic shape, but expands to a narrow bell-shape or a broad cone in maturity, typically reaching in diameter. The cap margin, which is initially pressed against the stem, is opaque or nearly so at first. It is scarlet red when fresh and moist, becoming orange or yellowish orange before losing moisture. The mushroom is hygrophanous, and fades to an orange buff color when dry. The flesh is thin, the same color as the cap, fragile, and without any distinctive taste or odor. The gills are ascending-adnate (the gills attach at much less than a right angle, appearing to curve upward toward stem) or attached by a tooth, subdistant to close, with 14‚Äì16 gills reaching the stem. Additionally, there are two or three tiers of lamellulae‚Äîshort gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem. The gills are narrow, and yellowish or with a reddish tinge at first; the margins are paler and the same color as the faces. The stem is long and thick, and roughly equal in width throughout. It is tubular, fragile, initially pruinose (covered with a fine powder), polished and smooth with age, pale yellow, becoming whitish, with the base often dirty yellow or brownish. Mycena adonis mushrooms are inedible. Microscopic characteristics The spores are narrowly ellipsoid, nonamyloid, and measure 6‚Äì7 by 3‚Äì3.5 Œºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 20‚Äì22 by 6‚Äì7 Œºm. The cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the edges and faces, respectively, of the gills) are abundant and similar in shape and markings, 40‚Äì58 by 10‚Äì15 Œºm, tapering somewhat on either end and usually with a long needle-shaped neck (which is branched in some). The cystidia are generally smooth, but when dried material is mounted in potassium hydroxide for observation under light microscopy, an amorphous substance apparently holds spores and debris around the neck or apex, making them appear encrusted. The flesh of the gill is very faintly vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The cap flesh has a thin, poorly differentiated pellicle with a region of slightly enlarged cells beneath it; the remainder is filamentous, and the filamentous portion stains vinaceous-brown in iodine.Smith, pp. 177‚Äì78.

There are several other mycenas with which Mycena adonis could be confused. is typically a smaller mushroom with a deep orange-red cap rather than the typical bright salmon-pink color of M. adonis. Since the colors and sizes of M. acicula and M. adonis are similar, a microscope is needed to reliably distinguish between them, with spore size and shape being different. can be distinguished from M. adonis by its orange cap and amyloid spores. can be distinguished from M. adonis by it lack of scarlet to pinkish tones in the cap and lack of gelatinized cortical hyphae. Mycena oregonensis is differentiated from M. adonis by its orange to yellow cap and lack of scarlet to pinkish tones. M. roseipallens has a smaller fruit body, wider spores, a less intensely colored and less conical cap, and grows on the decaying wood of elm, ash, and alder. Ecology, habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of Mycena adonis grow solitarily or in groups in conifer forests, and appear in the spring and autumn. The fruit bodies grow in groups or scattered on needle beds under spruce and hemlock in the wet coastal conifer forests, or in the higher mountains, where it is not uncommon in the spring and autumn months. In one instance, fruit bodies were found growing on the deciduous trees Spanish Maple (Acer granatense) and willow (Salix alba) near Amsterdam, Holland. It was hypothesized that the bark of these trees had become more acid in recent years because of increasing atmospheric pollution (specifically, increases in the levels of sulfuric and nitric acid from industrial smoke), providing a more suitable substrate for the fungus. The fungus is found in western North America, and in 2007, it was reported from the valley of the Ussuri River in the northeast of China. It is also found in Europe (Britain, Germany, Holland Scotland) and the Canary Islands. Mycena specialist Alexander H. Smith has found the species in Washington, Oregon, and California.

The fungus produces small white fruit bodies (mushrooms) with caps up to in diameter that appear to be dusted with sugar- like granules. Caps are supported by thin, hollow stems up to long, which are set on a disc-like base. It is distributed in the United States, where it has been found from Washington to California, Europe, and Turkey. The fruit bodies grow on fallen twigs and other woody debris on the forest floor, including fallen hazel nuts. The variety carpophila is known from Japan. There are several small white Mycena species that are similar in appearance to M. adscendens, some of which can be reliably distinguished only by examining microscopic characteristics. Taxonomy The species, originally named Agaricus adscendens by Wilhelm Gottfried Lasch in 1829, was first collected in the Province of Brandenburg, in what was then the Kingdom of Prussia (now Germany). It was Dutch mycologist Maas Geesteranus who assigned the species its current name in a 1981 publication. According to Maas Geesteranus, Miles Berkeley's 1836 Agaricus tenerrimus is the same species as Mycena adscendens, as well as all later synonyms based on this basionym: Mycena tenerrima, published by Lucien Qu√©let in 1872; Prunulus tenerrimus by William Alphonso Murrill in 1916; and Karel Cejp's 1930 Pseudomycena tenerrima. Although Index Fungorum agrees with Maas Geesteranus's synonymy, other authorities treat the species as independent. An additional synonym is Agaricus (Mycena) farinellus, described by Johann Feltgen from Luxembourg in 1906. The variety M. adscendens var. carpophila, published by Dennis Desjardin in 1995, was originally proposed as M. tenerrima var. carpophila by Jakob Emanuel Lange in 1914. Mycena adscendens is the type species of section Sacchariferae of the genus Mycena, which contains white species with floccose caps (covered with tufts of soft woolly hairs). Other members of this section include M. floccifera, M. discopus, and M. nucicola. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"frosty bonnet\\". The specific epithet adscendens, derived from the Latin, means \\"ascending\\" or \\"curving up from a prostrate base\\". Tenerrima derives from the Latin tener, meaning \\"tender\\" or \\"delicate\\". Description Gills are distantly spaced The cap is white and small, with a diameter typically ranging from . Initially convex to cucullate (hood-shaped), it flattens during maturity, developing visible surface grooves that correspond to the gills underneath the cap; the surface may also be covered with glistening particles, remnants of the partial veil. The cap is pallid gray with a whitish margin when young, but soon becomes white overall. The flesh is membranous, fragile, and thin (less than 0.5 mm). The gills are free from attachment or narrowly attached (adnexed) to the stem. They are up to 0.5 mm broad, distantly-spaced (usually numbering between 7 and 12), and sometimes adhering to each other to form a slight collar (a pseudocollarium) around the stem. They are translucent-white throughout their development, with a fringed, white edge. The hollow stem is long, and usually curved and threadlike. The bottom of the stem is enlarged into a slight bulb, which is initially nearly spherical.Smith (1947), pp. 45‚Äì7. At the very base of the stem is a small, white, and hairy disk-like base that attaches to the substrate. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown, but like many small Mycenas, they are insubstantial and not likely to be considered for the table. The variety carpophila is characterized by its tiny white cap up to 1 mm in diameter, and narrowly conical caulocystidia (cystidia found on the stem). Microscopic characteristics Mycena adscendens produces a white spore print. The spores are broadly ellipsoid, amyloid, and have dimensions of 8‚Äì10 by 5‚Äì6.5 ¬µm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are two-spored, club-shaped, and measure 14‚Äì17 by 7‚Äì9 ¬µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) may be present or absent. If present, they are similar to the cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges). The cheilocystidia are abundant, measuring 28‚Äì44 by 8‚Äì12 ¬µm. They are variable in shape, often fusoid-ventricose (fuse-shaped with a swollen center) or with 2‚Äì3 needle-like projections arising from the apex; the projections are sometimes forked. The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or warts. The flesh of the gills is vinaceous- brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25‚Äì40 by about 20 ¬µm. Their walls are finely verrucose (covered with small warts), and all but the verrucose cells are vinaceous- brown in iodine. Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae. Similar species Mycena stylobates is a robust lookalike of M. adscendens. Other Mycenas that resemble M. adscendens include M. alphitophora and M. stylobates. The former is distinguished from M. adscendens by a stem base that is not swollen or disc-like, the latter by its larger and sturdier fruit body and lack of granules on the cap. A poorly known Japanese species, M. cryptomeriicola, is similar to M. adscendens, but has non-amyloid spores and lacks clamps. M. nucicola is most reliably distinguished from M. adscendens by microscopic characteristics: M. nucicola has four-spored basidia, clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of the gill tissue, and the spores are less broad (typically 4.2‚Äì5 ¬µm). The Finnish species M. occulta grows on the decaying needles of Norway spruce and Scots pine. It differs from M. adscendens in that its gills do not form a pseudocollarium, it lacks clamps in the hyphae and cells of the hymenium, and the terminal cells in its cap cuticle are densely covered with protuberances. Habitat and distribution Fruit bodies of Mycena adscendens are found scattered to grouped together in twos or threes on fallen twigs, bark, and woody debris of hardwoods during the spring and autumn; it fruits less frequently on the wood of conifers. Fruitings are most common after periods of wet weather. They are also found growing on hazel nuts that have fallen to the ground; two other Mycenas known to grow on this substrate include M. discopus and M. nucicola. In the United States, it is known from Washington to California. It is also found in Europe, and has been collected in Amasya Province, Turkey. The variety carpophila, originally described from Denmark, was reported from Japan in 2003.

It is found in Europe and the United States, where it grows in groups on fallen leaves and needles under pine and Douglas fir. The small grayish mushrooms have caps that are up to wide atop stipes that are long and thick. Its gills are grayish-white and adnate, with a \\"tooth\\" that runs slightly down the stipe. The fungus has both two- and four- spored basidia. As its common name suggests, it smells mealy. Taxonomy First called Agaricus cinerellus by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1879, he transferred it to the genus Mycena that same year. In his 1936 Flora Agaricina Danica (Agaric flora of Denmark) Jakob Emanuel Lange referred it to the genus Omphalia; Omphalia cinerea (P. Karst.) J.E. Lange is now a synonym. Mycena cineroides was named and described as a new species distinct from M. cinerella by Hintikka in 1963, who thought it to be unique due to its narrowly acute cap that lacked brownish or yellowish tones, decurrent gills, and two- spored basidia. However, intermediate forms of it have been found, and some authorities, like Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus, believe it should be treated as a synonym of M. cinerella. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"mealy bonnet\\". The specific epithet cinerella means \\"somewhat ashy color\\". Description There are 2‚Äì3 tiers of lamellulae interspersed between the gills. The cap of M. cinerella is white and small, with a diameter typically ranging from . Initially hemispherical, obtusely conic, and then convex, it expands during maturity, developing visible grooves on the surface that correspond to the gills underneath the cap. The cap has a broad, flattened umbo. The cap surface is smooth and moist, with a slimy margin that is initially pressed against the stipe; with age the margin becomes notched and sometimes scalloped, turning translucent. The cap color is dark gray to pale gray, somewhat hygrophanous, fading to ashy white or brown when dry. The flesh is thin, gray, cartilaginous and tough, with a strongly farinaceous (mealy, similar to raw potatoes) odor and taste if crushed or chewed. The whitish to grayish gills are moderately broad (2‚Äì3 mm) with a spacing that is close to subdistant, and 18‚Äì26 reach the stipe, interspersed with two or three tiers of lamellae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stipe). The stipe attachment is adnate or arcuate, but later develops a pronounced decurrent tooth. The decurrent tooth occasionally separates from the stipe and forms a collar around it. The stipe is long, thick, equal in width throughout, hollow, cartilaginous, and brittle. The stipe surface is smooth or polished, with the apex initially faintly pruinose (as if covered with a fine whitish powder). The base of the stipe is sparsely covered with sharp, straight, stiff hairs, and is the same color as the cap or paler.Smith, pp. 366‚Äì68. The mushroom is inedible. Microscopic characteristics The spores are 7‚Äì9 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm, ellipsoid, smooth, amyloid (reaction very weak in some collections). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, or occasionally a combination of two- and four-spored. The four-spored forms have clamp connections that are absent in the two-spored forms. The pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the face of the gills) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the edges of the gills) are embedded in the hymenium and inconspicuous, measuring 22‚Äì36 by 5‚Äì11 Œºm. They are roughly filiform (like thin filaments), with numerous contorted branches or protuberances, and club-shaped with finger-like prolongations. The flesh of the gills is homogenous, and turns vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a well-differentiated pellicle, with a differentiated but not very well-developed hypoderm, and hyphae that are 10‚Äì20 Œºm wide. Habitat and distribution Mycena cinerella is a saprobic fungus, and derives nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fruit bodies grow in groups on needles under pine and Douglas fir, typically in the late summer and autumn. In the United States, it has been collected from Michigan, Washington, Oregon, and California. In Europe, it has also been collected from the Great Britain, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.

The cap is initially conical in shape, before becoming convex and then flattening out; it may reach dimensions of up to across. The cap color is ivory-white to yellowish white, sometimes more yellowish at the center. The tubular stems are up to long and thick, and have long, coarse white hairs at their bases. The mushroom is found in Europe, the Middle East, and North America, where it grows scattered or in dense groups under conifers and on humus in oak woods. Taxonomy, classification, and naming First described as Agaricus flavoalbus by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838, it was assigned its current name in 1872 by Lucien Qu√©let. American mycologist Rolf Singer transferred the species to the genera Hemimycena and Marasmiellus in 1938 and 1951, respectively. Singer later changed his mind about these placements, and his 1986 Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, he considered the species a Mycena. The binomials resulting from these transfers are considered synonyms; another synonym is Mycena luteoalba (Bolton) Gray. Mycena flavoalba is placed in the section Adonideae of the genus Mycena, alongside species such as and . The specific epithet flavoalba (\\"yellow-white\\") is a compound of the Latin adjectives flavus (\\"yellow) and alba (\\"white\\"). The mushroom's common name is the \\"ivory bonnet\\". Description The whitish to creamy white gills are waxy in appearance and consistency. The cap of M. flavoalba is in diameter, conical when young, becoming somewhat bell-shaped, broadly conic or at times nearly convex. It may develop a papilla (a nipple-like structure) in its center. The cap margin is initially pressed against the stem, but in maturity either flares out or curves inward slightly. The cap surface is smooth, moist, and partially translucent, so that the outline of the gills underneath the cap may be seen. The mushroom is hygrophanous (changing color as it loses or gains moisture), being cream-buff to yellowish initially, with a paler (almost white) margin, and fading to buff in the center and yellowish-white along the margin when dry. The flesh is yellowish to white, thick under the disc but otherwise thin, moderately fragile, and without any distinctive odor and taste. The gills are ascending and somewhat hooked or toothed, narrow at first but becoming rather broad (2.5 mm and becoming 3‚Äì4 mm). They are nearly equal in width throughout or slightly ventricose in age, with a spacing that is close to subdistant. About 18‚Äì24 gills reach the stem, with two tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) that may develop veins running between them. The gills are white to creamy-white with edges that are even and whitish, and waxy in appearance and consistency. The stem is long, thick, equal, tubular, somewhat elastic, cartilaginous, and not particularly fragile. The base of the stem is either strigose (covered with sharp, straight, stiff white hairs) or surrounded with a matted white mycelium. Above the base, the stem is smooth, and pruinose toward the apex. When moist it is translucent with slight ripples running transversely, and white to pale yellow in color. Mycena flavoalba is considered inedible. Microscopic characteristics The spores are 7‚Äì9 by 3‚Äì4.5 Œºm, ellipsoid, and nonamyloid. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the face and edge of a gill, respectively) are similar in structure and abundant, ventricose with long, rather narrow necks, and measure 46‚Äì62 by 9‚Äì14 Œºm. The neck is often encrusted with a mucilaginous substance, but it is otherwise smooth and hyaline. The flesh of the gill is homogenous, and stains pale yellow in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a thin, poorly differentiated pellicle (a thin membrane), a somewhat differentiated hypoderm (that is most pronounced in old caps) and the remainder is made up of somewhat enlarged cells that stain pale yellow in iodine.Smith, p.166‚Äì68. Similar species Mycena flavoalba bears resemblance to some members of the genus Hemimycena, such as H. lactea and H. delectabilis. It can be distinguished from these species by its white to yellowish cap, and differences in the shape of both its spores and caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem). H. conidiogena, a Spanish species newly described from in 2005, is also similar in appearance, but differs in the distribution of pigment in the cap, and the differential staining in response to the dye cresyl blue‚ÄîM. flavoalba is positive, while H. conidiogena is negative. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of Mycena flavoalba grow scattered to densely gregarious on needle beds under conifers, and on humus in oak woods during the autumns months. Although generally rare, the species sometimes occurs in large quantities in certain localities. In the United States, it has been collected from Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Florida, and Kansas. It is also found in Europe, and Israel.

The doubtfully edible mushroom has a reddish-brown bell-shaped cap up to in diameter. The thin stem is up to tall, whitish to yellow-brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish-brown towards the base in maturity, where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The gills are pale brown to pinkish, and the spore print is white. It is a widespread saprobic fungus, and has been found in Europe, North Africa, Asia, Australasia, and North America, where it grows in small groups or tufts on fallen logs and stumps, especially of oak. British mycologist E.J.H. Corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from Borneo. Lookalike species with which M. inclinata may be confused include M. galericulata and M. maculata. Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming First described as Agaricus inclinatus by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838, it was assigned its current name in 1872 by Lucien Qu√©let. Mycena galericulata var. calopus (named by Karsten in 1879), and its basionym Agaricus galericulatus var. calopus (named by Fries in 1873), are synonyms. In a molecular study of the large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the orchid Gastrodia confusa, M. inclinata was found to be closely related to M. aurantiomarginata, M. crocata, and M. leaiana. The specific epithet inclinata means \\"bent in\\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"clustered bonnet\\" or the \\"oak-stump bonnet cap\\". Description The stems gradually become deep brown near the base. The cap is light reddish-brown, with a diameter typically ranging from . Initially conic to bell-shaped to convex, it flattens during maturity, developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap. The margin of the cap has minute but distinct scallops. The surface is moist and smooth, and hygrophanous. The cap frequently develops splits in the margin, or cracks in the disc (the central part of the cap). The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere, grayish to whitish, fragile, and with a slightly mealy odor and taste. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stem (that is, running down the length of the stem) and are a pale brownish color with tinges of red. They are broad (between 3 and 6 mm), and have a close to subdistant spacing, with about 26‚Äì35 gills reaching the stem. The fragile stem is long by thick and yellow to yellow-brown, becoming reddish-brown to orange-brown in the bottom half in maturity. The lower portion of young stems is covered with white flecks. Roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom, the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The edibility of the mushroom is \\"doubtful\\" and consumption \\"best avoided\\". Microscopic characteristics The spores are 7‚Äì9 by 5‚Äì6.5 Œºm, broadly ellipsoid, smooth, and strongly amyloid (it turns black when treated with Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club-shaped, 26‚Äì36 by 5‚Äì10 Œºm, and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick. The flesh of the gills is homogeneous, and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a distinct pellicle, a well-differentiated hypoderm (a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle), and a filamentous tramal body (gill tissue); it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain.Smith, pp. 338‚Äì40. Varieties E.J.H. Corner defined the varieties M. inclinata var. kinabaluensis and var. subglobospora in his 1994 publication on Agaric mushrooms of Malesia, a biogeographical region straddling the boundary of the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. The variety kinabaluensis (named after its type locality, Kinabalu) has a cap margin that is not scalloped, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the dead wood of Lithocarpus havilandii, a stone oak tree in the beech family. Variety subglobospora, found in Sabah, has spores that are almost spherical. Similar species M. galericulata is a lookalike species. Mycena maculata bears some resemblance to M. inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and is found in eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M. inclinata. M. inclinata is often confused with the edible M. galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M. galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M. polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray. Habitat and distribution Mycena inclinata is a saprobic fungus, deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The fruit bodies of Mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps (especially oak and chestnut) during the spring and autumn. The fungus forms a white, woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves. Occasionally, it can be found growing on a living tree. In eastern North America, it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Missouri, North Carolina, and New York. It has been found in Oregon, but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast. The range of the fungus also includes Europe, the Canary Islands, North Africa, East Siberia, Japan, Malesia, Turkey, and New Zealand. Chemistry In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in Ordu (Turkey), M. inclinata was found to have comparatively high levels of iron (628 mg per kg) and nickel (21.6 mg/kg), measured on a dry weight basis. Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum. The fungus has been investigated for its ability to decolorize synthetic dyes that are used in the textile, plastics, biomedical and foodstuff industries. The dyes are not readily biodegradable, and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic.

The mushrooms have conical grayish caps that reach up to in diameter, and thin fragile stems up to long. The gills are gray and distantly spaced. The spores are elliptical, typically measure 7‚Äì10 by 4‚Äì6 Œºm, and are white in deposit. When viewed under a light microscope, the gills have abundant spindle-shaped cystidia on the gill edges, but few on the gill faces. The mushroom is found in North America, Asia, and Europe where it grows singly or in groups on conifer needles, cones and sticks on the forest floor. It has a distinctive odor of bleach; the edibility is unknown. Similar species include Mycena alcalina, M. austera, and M. brevipes. Taxonomy The species was first called Agaricus leptocephalus by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1800, and was transferred to the genus Mycena in 1876 by French mycologist Claude- Casimir Gillet. Synonyms include Agaricus alcalinus var. leptocephalus (Fries, 1821), Mycena alcaline var. chlorinella (J.E. Lange, 1914), and Mycena chlorinella (Singer, 1936). The latter was reduced to synonym in a 1980 publication by Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. Mycena leptocephala is classified in the section Fragilipedes of the genus Mycena, along with other similar-looking mushrooms, such as M. aetites, M. austera, M. parca, and M. aronsenii. Some of these have a nitrous smell similar to M. leptocephala. The specific epithet leptocephala is derived from the Greek ŒªŒµœÄœÑŒøœÇ leptos, \\"thin\\" and Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒ∑ kephale, \\"head\\", and refers to the delicate cap. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"nitrous bonnet\\". Description The distantly-spaced, pallid gills have an ascending-adnate attachment to the stem, and one or two tiers of interspersed lamellulae. The cap of M. leptocephala is in diameter, and initially a fat conical shape with the margin pressed close to the stem. As the cap expands, it becomes broadly conic to convex, sometimes broadly bell-shaped, and sometimes convex with a flaring margin. The cap surface has a whitish sheen because of its pruinose coating. The coating gradually sloughs off, leaving the surface smooth and moist. The cap shows radial grooves that outline the position of the gills underneath. Its color is initially dusky brownish-gray to blackish (after the pruinose coating has sloughed off), soon fading from dark to light gray and finally ashy-gray. The flesh is thin and fragile, grayish, and has a slightly sour (acidulous) taste, and a weakly alkaline odor that strengthens in intensity if the flesh is crushed. The gills are narrow, equal in width throughout, ascending-adnate (the gills attach at much less than a right angle, appearing to curve upward toward stem) and toothed. They are subdistantly spaced, with 18‚Äì27 gills reaching the stem, and one or two tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) interspersed between them. The color of the gills is pallid or cinereous, with pallid and even edges. The stem is long, 1‚Äì2 mm thick, equal in width throughout, hollow, and very fragile. It is usually bluish-black initially (darker than the cap) but gradually turns sordid brownish-gray, and finally fades to pallid or cinereous. The surface is densely white-pruinose overall, but soon polished and translucent when the pruinose coating wears off. The stem base is nearly smooth to rather densely white-strigose.Smith, pp. 241‚Äì44. The species has a distinctive bleach-like odor. Its edibility is currently unknown. Microscopic characteristics The spores are broadly ellipsoid. The spores are broadly ellipsoid, amyloid (meaning they will adsorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7‚Äì10 by 4‚Äì6 Œºm. The basidia (the spore- bearing cells) are usually four-spored, although two- and three-spored forms have been found on which the spores measure 11‚Äì14 by 6‚Äì6.5 Œºm or 8‚Äì10 by 3.5‚Äì4.5 Œºm, respectively. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of a gill) are scattered, rare or absent, 30‚Äì44 by 9‚Äì13 Œºm, variable in shape, fusoid- ventricose to club-shaped, with some having a forked apex. The pleurocystidia that are club-shaped occasionally have two or three finger-like prolongations. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are numerous, and similar in morphology to the pleurocystidia. The flesh of the gill is homogenous, composed of enlarged hyphae that stain vinaceous-brown in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a well-differentiated pellicle, the cells of which bear numerous rodlike prolongations. The hypoderm (a layer of tissue immediately below the pellicle) is well-formed, while the remaining tissue is floccose; all but the pellicle are vinaceous-brown in iodine stain. Similar species M. alcalina is a lookalike species. The \\"stump fairy helmet\\" Mycena alcalina is a common species that is similar in appearance and odor to M. leptocephala. However, it grows on conifer wood and rarely on the ground. Microscopically, it has numerous cystidia on the gill edges. Although M. leptocephala usually has a weaker alkaline odor and a more fragile stem, the strength of the odor of M. alcalina is also quite variable, so differences in odor cannot be used as the sole distinguishing characteristic. M. austera, described from southern Norway in 1994, differs from M. leptocephala by the lack of a nitrous odor, and differently shaped cheilocystidia and terminal cells of the cortical layer of the stem. Alexander H. Smith considers M. brevipes close to M. leptocephala, but the former mushroom has a short stem up to long, typically grows singly, and lacks an odor. Habitat and distribution Mycena leptocephala is a saprobic species, meaning it derives nutrients from the breakdown of organic matter. Fruit bodies are found growing scattered to gregarious on fallen sticks and on needle carpets under conifers, and are rather common during early summer and again in the autumn. Fruit bodies may be infected by the bonnet mold Spinellus fusiger. In North America, the fungus is found in Canada (British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia), to Washington and south to California and North Carolina. In South America, the mushroom has been collected in Venezuela. It also grows in the Archipelago of the Recherche, off the southern coast of Western Australia. In Europe, it is known from Britain, Finland, The Netherlands, Norway, and Spain It has also been found in various locations in Asia: the Vindhya Range of India; the Gwangneung Forest Museum in the Korea National Arboretum; and the alpine zone of Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, Jilin Province, China. The fungus is also known from Arctic and Alpine regions such as Iceland, Greenland, and the Murmansk region.

They are found in small troops on stumps and branches of deciduous and occasionally coniferous trees. The mushroom is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it is typically found on twigs or buried wood, carrying out its role in the forest ecosystem by decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and forming humus in the soil. M. polygramma contains two uncommon hydroxy fatty acids and is also a bioluminescent fungus whose intensity of light emission follows a diurnal pattern. Taxonomy First called Agaricus polygrammus by French mycologist Jean Bulliard in 1789, the species was later sanctioned under that name by Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum. It was soon after transferred into the genus Mycena in 1821 by Samuel Frederick Gray, who raised many of Fries' sub-generic divisions to the genus level. Agaricus chloroticus, described by Friedrich Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn in 1830, is the only known taxonomic synonym. The specific epithet is derived from the Greek œÄŒøŒªœçœÇ meaning \\"many\\" and Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒÆ, or \\"line\\". It is commonly known as the \\"grooved bonnet\\". Description The gills are squarely attached to the stem, and flushed with pink in maturity. The cap of the M. polygramma fruit body is in diameter, and initially egg- to cone-shaped, but expands to become conic to bell-shaped or nearly convex with an abrupt small umbo, or at times plane with a conic umbo. On young fruit bodies, the cap margin is slightly curved inward, and frequently has scalloped edges; in maturity the margin flares out, or is recurved and wavy. The surface of the cap is initially covered with short, fine whitish or grayish hairs that often persist until near maturity. With age, the cap surface becomes smooth, the color dark brownish-gray to black beneath the bloom, fading slowly to a pale gray, and nearly pinkish-buff at times. The cap margin is opaque and frequently has narrow, deep furrows or grooves, with the surface often more or less uneven and appearing as if streaked with glistening lines. The flesh is very hard and cartilaginous, watery grayish to white, rather thin, and with no distinctive odor and a mild taste. The gills are narrowly adnate (attached squarely to the stem) or have a short decurrent tooth, and are packed close together, with 30‚Äì38 gills reaching the stem. They are broad anteriorly (4‚Äì7 mm), white or whitish, in age flushed with pink, often with sordid-brownish stains, and with edges pallid and even. The stem is long, thick, very brittle and cartilaginous, equal, and tubular. It sometimes has a well-developed pseudorrhiza that resembles white cotton, and the base is covered with stiff white hairs, and often it stains reddish brown. The surface has fine straight or sometimes twisted longitudinal striations. The surface is ashy-gray or paler grayish- brown beneath the silvery covering, at times nearly smooth, with the apex pallid and faintly powdered. Various images of M. polygramma from Bulliard's Herbier de la France, 1789 Mycena polygramma is a bioluminescent mushroom, although the extent of luminescence can vary considerably. The mushroom is inedible, and has a mild to slightly acrid taste and a \\"pleasant\\" odor. Microscopic features Collected in deposit, such as in a spore print, the spores appear white. Viewed with a light microscope, the spores are broadly ellipsoid in shape, smooth, amyloid, with dimensions of 7.5‚Äì10 by 5‚Äì6 ¬µm. Occasionally the spores contain oil droplets. The basidia (pore-bearing cells) are four-spored, 26‚Äì30 by 7‚Äì8 ¬µm. The cheilocystidia are scattered to abundant, aciculate or with the midportion somewhat enlarged and the apex forked or branched, and give rise to two or several contorted finger-like projections. Pleurocystidia are not differentiated. Similar species Tall and slender forms of Mycena polygramma somewhat resemble M. pullata or M. praelonga. The former species is distinguished by its color, and the latter by its relationship to M. alcalina and its habitat on sphagnum. Ecology, habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of M. polygramma grow in groups or sub-clusters under hardwoods, particularly deciduous trees such as oak, maple, and basswood. In North America, it has been collected from North Carolina, Massachusetts, New York, and Michigan, where it fruits from June to October. The fruit bodies are susceptible to attack by the parasitic fungi Spinellus fusiger and S. macrocarpus. Typically found on twigs or buried wood, the fungus is known to be a vigorous decomposer of lignin and cellulose in leaf litter. Mycena polygramma is a saprobic fungus, and is one of many fungi that contribute to plant litter decomposition in forest ecosystems through nutrient recycling and humus formation in soil. It is a lignocellulose decomposer of larch litter, and can break down both lignin and carbohydrates, although it has a preference for carbohydrates. In an experiment testing the ability of several litter-decomposing fungi to remove lignin from leaves of the perennial grass Miscanthus sinensis, under pure culture conditions, M. polygramma showed limited ability to cause the mass loss of lignin. Rare in North America, the fungus is common in Europe, including Great Britain. They have been collected on the Falkland Islands, and Japan. Chemistry and bioluminescence Mycena polygramma contains the unusual hydroxy fatty acids 7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethyl-9-hexadecenoic acid (0.05% of the total fatty acids) and 7-hydroxy-8,16-dimethyl-9-octadecenoic acid (0.01%). The fungus is one of several dozen Mycena species that are bioluminescent. Unlike most luminescent organisms, M. polygramma has a diurnal rhythm of luminescence intensity, and has rises and falls of light intensity as high as 35 percent. However, this light emission is not typically noticed, as it can not be detected visually by the dark-adapted eye; sensitive photomultipliers or long exposure times are required to measure the phenomenon. The wavelength of spectral emissions from the fungus grown in pure culture is in the range 470‚Äì640 mŒº.

It is found in Europe and North America, where it grows on the ground among leaves in damp places, especially under alder. The small pale gray to whitish fruit bodies are usually attached to small sticks buried in the leaves and detritus. They are distinguished by their long, slender stems that root into the ground, and by the grooved cap that reaches diameters of up to . The grayish-white gills on the underside of the cap are distantly spaced, and adnately attached to the stem. M. vitilis contains strobilurin B, a fungicidal compound with potential use in agriculture. Taxonomy and naming First described as Agaricus vitilis by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838, it was assigned to Mycena vitilis in 1872 by Lucien Qu√©let. The white-bodied variant Mycena vitilis var. corsica has been described from Italy, and differs from the main species by its white fruit bodies and differing measurements for several microscopic characters. Carleton Rea named another variety amsegetes (meaning \\"field by the roadside\\"), which differs from the type variety by its \\"obsoletely umbonate\\" cap, its shorter and thicker stem, and its typical habitat of meadows and roadsides. The name \\"Mycena filopes\\" has also been confusingly applied to this species by some authors, although M. filopes (Bull.) P. Kumm. is a species that is recognized as being distinct from M. vitilis\\". The specific epithet vitilis is derived from the Latin word for \\"good for tying or binding with\\", or \\"plaited\\". The mushroom's common name is the \\"snapping bonnet\\". In his 1871 Handbook of British Fungi, Mordecai Cubitt Cooke called it the \\"flexile Mycena\\". Description The whitish gills are narrowly adnate. The cap of M. vitilis is initially conic or bell-shaped, but flattens out in maturity, and typically reaches dimensions of up to . When young, the cap margin is pressed against the stem, but as the cap expands it becomes bell-shaped or somewhat umbonate, and the margin flattens out or curves inward. The cap surface is initially hoary but soon becomes polished and slimy when moist, or shiny when dry. The cap margin is even, and has slight grooves that mark the position of the gills underneath. The cap color is beige (sometimes with a grayish tinge) with paler margins, fading to pale gray or nearly white in age. Occasionally, the mushroom cap has a strong brownish tint when fresh. Moist mushrooms have a slightly sticky surface. The flesh is thin but pliant, grayish or pallid, cartilaginous, and lacks any distinctive odor and taste. substrate is covered with white hairs. The gills are attached by a tooth and are narrowly adnate, close to subdistant, narrow, equal, white or grayish, and with edges concolorous and often slightly eroded. Berkeley noted that the gills \\"vary a good deal in colour, and are sometimes very dark\\". The stem is long, thick, equal in width throughout, cartilaginous and tough. The stem color is brown with a tinge of pink, and the color lightens towards the top. It is usually straight but often curved toward the base, and roots into in the debris, or is attached to sticks. Smith has noted that in optimal weather conditions, \\"robust\\" forms may be found that are \\"strict and rigid in their appearance.\\" The buried portion of the stem is covered with thick, stiff whitish hairs, and is surrounded with a thin subgelatinous layer, which causes it to be slimy to the touch. Its color is initially bluish-black, soon gray, nearly the same color as the cap, with the apex somewhat fibrous- striate.Smith, pp. 288‚Äì90. The mushroom is inedible. Microscopic characteristics The spores are ellipsoid, hyaline, amyloid, and measure 9‚Äì11 by 5‚Äì6 Œºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated or are occasionally present near the gill edge and similar to cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge). The cheilocystidia, which measure 32‚Äì46 by 8‚Äì14 Œºm, are tapered on either end and can have two to several obtuse fingerlike projections arising from the apex. The gill flesh stains vinaceous-brown in iodine. The subhymenium (the tissue layer directly underneath the hymenium) is made of narrow, interwoven hyphae, with the central portion composed of long, cylindrical, and moderately broad cells. The flesh of the cap has a fairly thick subgelatinous pellicle, a well-differentiated hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body. All except the pellicle stain vinaceous-brown in iodine. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of Mycena vitilis are found growing scattered or in groups on debris in hardwood or mixed conifer and hardwood forests. Along the Pacific Coast it is sometimes abundant in Red alder slashes. In eastern North America it is quite commonly found growing in the autumn months of October and November with M. semivestipes and M. pullata. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe (for example, Britain, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal). Chemistry Strobilurin B The fruit bodies of Mycena vitilis contain the chlorinated compound strobilurin B. Strobilurins are aromatic compounds produced by some fungi that help them secure resources by giving them an advantage against other competing fungi. They have been investigated for potential use as lead compounds for agricultural fungicides.

It is a common and widely distributed species, and has been found in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus produces reddish-brown to reddish-purple fruit bodies with conic to bell- shaped caps up to wide held by slender stipes up to high. When fresh, the fruit bodies will \\"bleed\\" a dark reddish-purple sap. The similar Mycena haematopus is larger, and grows on decaying wood, usually in clumps. M. sanguinolenta contains alkaloid pigments that are unique to the species, may produce an antifungal compound, and is bioluminescent. The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined. Taxonomy First called Agaricus sanguinolentus by Johannes Baptista von Albertini, the species was transferred to the genus Mycena in 1871 by German Paul Kummer, when he raised many of Fries' \\"tribes\\" to the rank of genus. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word sanguinolentus and means \\"bloody\\". It is commonly known as the \\"bleeding bonnet\\" the \\"smaller bleeding Mycena\\", or the \\"terrestrial bleeding Mycena\\". The fungus is classified in the section Lactipedes along with other latex-producing species.Smith 1947, pp. 132‚Äì33. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of several dozen European Mycena species suggests that M. sanguinolenta is closely related to . Other phylogenically related species include and . Description The cap of M. sanguinolenta is either convex or conic when young, with its margin pressed against the stipe. As it expands, it becomes broadly convex or bell-shaped, ultimately reaching a diameter of . The surface is initially covered with a dense whitish-grayish coating or powder that is produced by delicate microscopic cells, but these cells soon collapse and disappear, leaving the surface naked and smooth. The surface is moist with an opaque margin that soon developing furrows. The cap color is variable but always some shade of bright or dull reddish brown with a dull grayish-brown margin. The flesh is thin, not very fragile, sordid reddish, and exudes a reddish latex when cut. The odor and taste are not distinctive. The gills are adnate or slightly toothed, and well-spaced. They are narrow to moderately broad, sordid reddish to grayish, with even edges that are dark reddish brown. The stipe is long, 1‚Äì1.5 mm thick, equal in width throughout, and fragile. The base of the stipe is covered with coarse, stiff white hairs, while the remainder is covered with a drab powder that soon sloughs off to leave the stipe polished, and more or less the same color as the cap. It also exudes a bright or dull-red juice when cut or broken.Smith 1947, pp. 146‚Äì49. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown‚Äîbut it is considered too insubstantial to be of culinary interest. The spores are 8‚Äì10 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm, roughly ellipsoid, and only weakly amyloid. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) four-spored (occasionally two- or three-spored). The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of a gill) are rare to scattered or sometimes quite abundant, narrowly to broadly ventricose, measuring 36‚Äì54 by 8‚Äì13 Œºm. They are filled with a sordid- reddish substance. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are similar to the pleurocystidia or shorter and more obese, and very abundant. The flesh if the gill is made of broad hyphae the cells of which are often vesiculose (covered with vesicles) in age, and stain pale reddish brown in iodine. The flesh of the cap is covered with a thin pellicle, and the hypoderm (the layer of cells immediately underneath the pellicle) is moderately well- differentiated. The remainder of the cap flesh is floccose and filamentous, and all except the pellicle stain pale vinaceous-brown in iodine. Lactiferous (latex-producing) hyphae are abundant. Similar species The similar species M. haematopus typically grows in clusters on rotting wood. The other \\"bleeding Mycena\\" () is readily distinguished from M. sanguinolenta by its larger size, different color, growth on rotting wood, and presence of a sterile band of tissue on the margin of the cap. Further, M. sanguinolenta consistently has red-edged gills, while the gill edges of M. haematopus are more variable. The similarly named has red to orange juice, is slightly yellower, and does not have pleurocystidia. has a similar furrowed cap, but also has a tough stipe and does not ooze liquid when injured. Mycena specialist Alexander H. Smith has noted a \\"striking\\" resemblance to , but this species has different colors (pale vinaceous brown or sordid brown when faded), produces uncolored latex, and does not have differently-colored gill edges. Distribution and habitat Mycena sanguinolenta is common and widely distributed. It has been found from Maine to Washington and south to North Carolina and California in the United States, and from Nova Scotia to British Columbia in Canada. In Jamaica, it has been collected at an elevation of . The distribution includes Europe (Britain, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, Romania and Sweden) and Australia. In Asia, it has been collected from the alpine zone of the Changbai Mountains in Jilin Province, China, and from the provinces of ≈åmi and Yamashiro in Japan. The fruit bodies grow in groups on leaf mold, moss beds, or needle carpets during the spring and fall. It is common in forests of fir and beech, and prefers to grow in soil of high acidity. Chemistry The fruit bodies of Mycena sanguinolenta contain the blue alkaloid pigments, sanguinones A and B, unique to this species. It also has the red-colored alkaloid sanguinolentaquinone. The sanguinones are structurally related to mycenarubin A, made by M. rosea, and the discorhabins, a series of compounds produced by marine sponges. Although the function of the sanguinones is not known, it has been suggested that they may have \\"an ecological role ... beyond their contribution to the color of the fruiting bodies, ... since predators rarely feed on fruiting bodies\\". When grown in pure culture in the laboratory, the fungus produces the antifungal compound hydroxystrobilurin-D. M. sanguinolenta is one of over 30 Mycena species that is bioluminous.

A royalist, he suffered deprivation of his benefices after the First English Civil War. Life According to local tradition he was born at Plas Bennett, in the parish of Llandyrnog, Denbighshire, and belonged to the Roberts family that long resided there. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow, and in 1619 he held the office of proctor of the university. In 1629 he was appointed to the sub-deanery of Wells, which he resigned on his promotion, through the interest of William Laud, to the see of Bangor. His consecration took place in September 1637. He held, in commendam with his bishopric, the rectory of Llandyrnog and the sinecure rectory of Llanrhaiadr in Cimmerch (both of which continued to be so held by his successors until 1859), together with the archdeaconries of Bangor and Anglesea (which were held by occupants of the see between 1574 and 1685). He is said to have suffered much for his adherence to the king during the civil war. In 1649 his temporal estates were sequestrated, and the manor of Gogarth was sold on 18 July 1650. He is mentioned in a list of those whose estates were declared forfeited for treason by an act of 18 October 1652; but all his property was restored to him in 1660. In the following year he recommenced services in the cathedral and settled the orders of preaching. He died on 12 August 1665 at the rectory, Llandyrnog, near Denbigh, and was buried in the chancel of that church.

Founded one year after the establishment of the Romanian state, by an 1860 decree of Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza, under whom the former Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ was converted to a university, the University of Ia»ôi, as it was named at first, is the oldest university of Romania, and one of its advanced research and education institutions.Institutii de invatamant superior clasificate ca universitati de cercetare avansata si educatie It is one of the five members of the Universitaria Consortium (the group of elite Romanian universities).Consor»õiul Universitaria s-a √Æntrunit la Tulcea The Alexandru Ioan Cuza University offers study programmes in Romanian, English, and French. In 2008, for the third year in a row, it was placed first in the national research ranking compiled on the basis of Shanghai criteria. In the 2012 QS World University Rankings, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University was included in the Top 700 universities of the world, on the position 601+ , together with three other Romanian universities. The University is a member of some of the most important university networks and associations: the Coimbra Group (CG), Utrecht Network, European University Association (EUA), International Association of Universities (IAU), University Agency of Francophony (AUF), and the Network of Francophone Universities (RUFAC). History Portrait of Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza Ia»ôi has a long tradition in higher education, the first institute that functioned on the territory of Romania was Academia VasilianƒÉ founded in 1640 by the Moldavian Prince Vasile Lupu, followed, in 1707, by Princely Academy of Ia»ôi. The Princely Academy (renamed, in 1812, The Academy of Filology and Science) matched up to the standards of the other European Academies of the time and the Romanian language gained importance over the Greek language. The foundation, in 1835, of the Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ is considered a landmark in the history of Romanian higher education. The Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ was created under the auspices of Prince Mihail Sturdza (hence its name), striving for progress and for \\"meeting the standards of the enlightened Europe\\". Three faculties were set up: the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Philosophy and the Faculty of Theology and the curriculum resembled to a great extent that of Austrian and German academies. After the Unification of the Romanian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia by the Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza, the inauguration, at 26 October 1860, of the University of Ia»ôi, the first Romanian modern university, was to be a stepping stone to modern higher education in Romania. By 1879, the University of Ia»ôi had four faculties: Law, Letters and Philosophy, Sciences, and Medicine. In 1892, the Faculty of Sciences added the Department of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry, followed by the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, in 1906, and the School of the Industrial Electricity, in 1910. In March 1937, the technical higher education departments were transferred to the newly established Gheorghe Asachi Polytechnic School, and in 1948, the Faculty of Agriculture became the Ia»ôi Agronomic Institute, while the Medical School became the Institute of Medicine and Pharmacy of Ia»ôi.A short history of the University of Ia»ôi Blazon Its coat of arms with the Y shaped heraldic pall symbolizes the three initiatives which led to the foundation of the University: the Academia VasilianƒÉ, the Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ, the University of Ia»ôi.

The three shiny stars stand for the three faculties of the University at its foundation moment, Philosophy, Law and Theology, on blue and argent background, the same colors used on the Cuza family shield. Grounds The University Square The university grounds lie on Copou Hill in the northern part of the city. The main university building, known as the University Palace, was erected between 1893 and 1897, and extended in 1933‚Äì1937, on the site of the first Ia»ôi National Theatre which had burned down in 1888. The Hall of the University, known as The Hall of the Lost Footsteps, served as a parliamentary debating chamber between 1917 and 1918 when, during the Great War, Ia»ôi was the capital of Romania. In 1968‚Äì1978, the painter Sabin BƒÉla≈üa created a series of strongly romanticized frescoes for the arcades. The University Palace is shared with the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University.

Background Farida Mzamber Waziri was born on 7 July 1949 and raised in Gboko, Benue State. She obtained a law degree from the University of Lagos and obtained a master's degree in Law from the Lagos State University. In 1996, she gained a master's degree in Strategic Studies from the University of Ibadan. She is the author of Advance Fee Fraud, National Security and the Law. Police career Farida Waziri enlisted in the Nigeria Police Force in 1965 and rose to the position of Assistant Inspector General of Police. She held the positions of Assistant Commissioner of Police (Operations), screening and selection, Assistant/Deputy Commissioner of Police Force C.I.D Alagbon, Lagos, Commissioner of Police, General Investigation and Commissioner of Police in charge of X-Squad. In this last position she was responsible for handling cases of bribery and corruption within the police force. She also served as Commissioner of Police (special fraud unit) in which role she recorded the first conviction for Advance Fee Fraud in Nigeria. She led the West African delegation on Advance Fee Fraud to Lyons, France in 1996. She led the Nigeria delegation to Dallas, Texas for a seminar organised by the United States Secret Service in 1998. Personal life She was married to Senator Ajuji Waziri, a former Ambassador to Turkey who passed on in 2017. EFCC chairman When being screened for the EFCC job by the Senate committee on anti- corruption, she denied that she had stood as surety for the former Benue State governor, Senator George Akume when he was charged with corruption. She was confirmed by President Umaru Yar'Adua as EFCC chairman in May 2008, but refused to accept the position until she had also been confirmed by the Senate. The appointment to this sensitive position was controversial. Shortly after her appointment, Waziri inspected the EFCC detention facilities to ascertain the conditions of suspects. In September 2008 Waziri said that allegations of corruption by former president Olusegun Obasanjo and some former state governors could not be supported because the files did not exist or they had disappeared. In August 2008, the EFCC arrested former National Deputy Chairman of the PDP Bode George in Lagos and arraigned him and four others on a 163 count-charge of conspiracy, disobedience to lawful order, abuse of office and alleged illegal award of contracts worth N84 billion while he was chairman of the NPA. In October 2009, Bode George was found guilty and sentenced to jail for 30 months. In April 2009 Waziri said that the EFCC was making arrangements to extradite former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory Mallam Nasir El-Rufai from the US to face charges. She also said the President had approved the return to the Nigeria Police Force of insurance benefits that were part of the N17 billion recovered from the former Inspector General of Police Mustafa Adebayo Balogun, although Alhaji Tafa Balogun was seeking the return of these assets. She said were 200 pending cases for corruption, money laundering, fraud, illegal oil bunkering and pipeline vandalism. In June 2009, speaking at a press conference to mark her first year in office, Farida Waziri said the EFCC was continuing its efforts to prosecute former governors including Dr. Peter Odili of Rivers State, Senator Bola Tinubu of Lagos State, Ayo Fayose of Ekiti State, Joshua Dariye of Plateau State, Saminu Turaki of Jigawa State, Jolly Nyame of Taraba State and Michael Botmang of Plateau State. Other high-level suspects being pursued included Senator Nicholas Ugbane and the former FCT Minister Nasir El-Rufai. She expressed frustration at court delays in these cases. She also said she would start to crack down on property ownership cases in Abuja. In May 2009 there were reports of a power struggle with EFCC Director of Operations, Mr. Tunde Ogunshaki, who had been sacked by Waziri, apparently involving James Ibori, the Nigerian Attorney General, Mike Aondoakaa and the Inspector General of Police Mike Mbama Okiro. Also in May, the EFCC took into custody in connection with the N6 billion rural electrification contract scam Senate Committee chairman on Power, Senator Nicholas Ugbane, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Power, Alhaji Abdullahi Aliyu and others. Later that year, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission gave a list to the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress of 56 prominent Nigerians who allegedly had between them defrauded the nation of N243 billion. Dismissal and later career Waziri was removed from her position by President Goodluck Jonathan on 23 November 2011 and on 28 November 2011 was replaced by Ibrahim Lamorde as acting chairman Her dismissal may have been related to accusations that the EFCC had been selective in its investigations, or to her falling out with the Attorney- General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bello Adoke over the prosecution of cases that were brought before the court. It was also alleged that Waziri might have compromised the investigation into financial misappropriation against the former governor of Bayelsa state, Timipreye Sylva In some cases, as with a case against former Edo State governor Lucky Igbinedion, the court imposed negligible penalties. However, the EFCC may have opened the door by agreeing to accept a plea bargain. After leaving office, there were reports that Waziri was considering writing a book about her experience at the EFCC.

After training in Antwerp, he spent time in Rome where he had important patrons. After his return to Flanders he worked for a while in Brussels likely painting flower still lifes for Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the Austrian governor of the Spanish Netherlands, before returning to work in Antwerp.Jan van den Hecke (I) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Jan van den Hecke was born in Kwaremont near Ronse, about 10 km from Oudenaarde, East Flanders. He was registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as an apprentice in 1636. He was a pupil of Abraham Hack, who also taught his contemporary, the flower painter Hieronymus Galle.Hieronymus Galle (I) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He became a master in the Antwerp Guild in the year 1641‚Äì1642. Portrait of a young man in a flower garland He travelled to Italy where he resided in Rome but the exact dates of his trip are unclear. Alternative dates proposed are from 1644 to 1659 and 1653 to 1658.Jan van den Hecke I (Biographical details) at the British Museum In Rome he enjoyed the patronage of Paolo Giordano II Orsini, the duke of Bracciano. He may also have travelled in France during the 1650s. Jan van den Hecke spent time in Brussels in the mid 1650s. During his stay in Brussels in the mid 1650s he may have worked for Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the Austrian governor of the Spanish Netherlands. who resided in Brussels and was an avid art collector. A number of van den Hecke's still life paintings found their way into the Archduke's collection and from there into the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Archduke Leopold Wilhelm must have particularly liked his flower pieces as all of van den Hecke's paintings which he collected were pictures of flowers in vases and baskets and garland paintings.Huguette Vanagt, Dani√´l Seghers - Guirlande met de Heilige Theresia van Avila at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen Van den Hecke returned to Antwerp around 1657. Flowers in a vase with the siege of Gravelingen In 1660 he married Maria Adriana Heyens with whom he had three children. His son, known as Jan van den Hecke the Younger, was born in 1661 and became a popular painter of flowers, other types of still life as well as of landscapes.Jan van den Hecke (II) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His two known pupils were Peeter vander Elstraeten (1657‚Äì60) and Peeter de Clerc (1672‚Äì73). He died in Antwerp in 1684. Work General Jan van den Hecke was a versatile artist working in many genres and techniques. He made still lifes of flowers, fruit and game, paintings of animals, landscapes, genre scenes, military scenes and allegorical paintings. Still lifes He was a gifted flower painter. As in the work of other Antwerp painters of his generation such as Jan Brueghel the Younger and Philips de Marlier, some of the flower paintings of van den Hecke were dedicated to the presentation of a single variety of flowers: tulips and wallflowers.The Zoographia at Old Master Prints Some of his flower still lifes, such as the Flowers in a Vase with the Siege of Gravelingen (Kunsthistorisches Museum), include a view onto a landscape or a battle scene, two genres in which van den Hecke was skilled.Jan van den Hecke, Flowers in a Vase with the Siege of Gravelingen at the Kunsthistorisches Museum Sumptuous still life Jan van den Hecke made a number of works in a distinctively Flemish genre, which is referred to as 'garland painting'. Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in early 17th century Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder at the instigation of the Italian cardinal Federico Borromeo.David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150. Other artists involved in the early development of the genre included Hendrick van Balen, Andries Daniels, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth- Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement. It was further inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally. Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image, portrait or other religious symbol (such as the host). Shepherds and travellers by a triumphal arch in the Roman Campagna Garland paintings were typically collaborations between a still life specialist and a figure painter. As van den Hecke was a gifted figure painter he may have painted both the still life elements as the figures in some of his garland paintings. This may have been the case in his Rosary Madonna in a Garland (circa 1671, Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ Archdiocesan Museum, Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, Czech Republic).Jan van den Hecke, Rosary Madonna in a Garland at the Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ Archdiocesan Museum A collaboration with the figure painter Jan Lievens is the Portrait of a Young Man in Flower Garland (c. 1642‚Äì1644, Kunsthistorisches Museum).Jan Lievens and Jan van den Hecke, Portrait of a Young Man in Flower Garland at the Kunsthistorisches Museum Van den Hecke also painted still lifes of game with dogs in the style of Jan Fyt and pronkstillevens with ostentatious objects, a genre invented in Antwerp.Jan van den Hecke the Elder, Still Life with a Gilt Goblet, Fruit and Oysters, 1643, on artnet He was particularly skilled at painting gold, silver, crystal and porcelain. Landscapes and military scenes His landscapes often include battle or military scenes with many figures.Joannes van Heck biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 His landscapes are in an Italianate style. One of his paintings representing a Market in the Roman Campagna was formerly attributed to the Flemish Italianate painter Anton Goubau.Jan van den Hecke (I), Market in the Roman Campagna at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Other of his landscapes tend towards the genre scenes painted by the group of Flemish and Dutch painters in Rome known as the Bamboccianti.Jan van den Hecke (I), Hunting Party at a Tavern The Bamboccianti comprised mostly Dutch and Flemish artists who had brought existing traditions of depicting peasant subjects from sixteenth-century Netherlandish art with them to Italy,Levine, David A.

The aftermath of the battle Prints In the mid 1650s he made a number of etchings depicting various animals and battle scenes. He collaborated with other printmakers on publishing projects. In 1654 he made the designs for a series of 10 plates which were engraved by the Dutch engraver Theodor van Kessel and were entitled Alcune Animali (Some animals). This series depicted various animals.Title-page of the series Alcune Animali at the British Museum He created another series of 11 prints plus a title page referred to as the Zoographia (Description of Animals), which also depicted different animals and was printed in 1656.

The plantation's surviving structures-- which include the plantation house, a storage shed, and smokehouse-- have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The plantation house has been called \\"the best example of a Federal-style building remaining in Sevier County.\\" Wheatlands, named after its large annual wheat crop, was established as a family farm by Revolutionary War veteran Timothy Chandler in 1791. Chandler's son, John Chandler (1786-1875), inherited Wheatlands in 1819, and under his direction the plantation grew to become one of Sevier County's largest farms, covering by 1850.Jones, p. 24, 29. Chandler's freed slaves inherited part of Wheatlands in 1875, and formed the Chandler Gap community in the hills south of the plantation.Jones, p. 42. Location Wheatlands is located at the corner of State Highway 338 (Boyds Creek Highway, sometimes called Old Knoxville Highway) and Cedar Springs Valley Road in the Boyd's Creek community, about halfway between Sevierville and Seymour. The plantation was situated along the banks of Boyd's Creek, which empties into the French Broad River at the Brabson's Ferry Plantation about a mile to the east. This gave Wheatlands access to the nation's interior waterways, allowing this shipment of its \\"Wheat Whiskey\\" to New Orleans. History View of the west end of the house, showing the rear kitchen/dining room wing State Highway 338 roughly follows what was once a section of the 18th-century Native American trail known as the Great Indian Warpath. In 1780, John Sevier followed the path across the French Broad River to engage and defeat a Cherokee force at the Battle of Boyd's Creek, which took place at the future site of Wheatlands.David Templin, The Lesser Franklin. Retrieved: 2009-09-25. Early settlers also followed the trail into the Boyd's Creek area, among them Timothy Chandler, a Revolutionary War veteran from Virginia, who moved his family to Boyd's Creek in 1791. After Timothy Chandler died in 1819, his son, John Chandler, inherited the family's Boyd's Creek farm. The original Chandler farmhouse burned in 1823, and John Chandler built the present plantation house at the site to replace it. By 1850, Wheatlands had become one of the largest farms in Sevier County, covering some worth $7,000 (US$ in present terms), and included fifteen horses, ten mules, forty cattle, fifty sheep, and three hundred hogs. Chandler and fourteen slaves produced 3,000 bushels of corn, 400 bushels of oats, 200 bushels of sweet potatoes, 12 bushels of buckwheat, 10 tons of hay, 150 pounds of wool, 200 pounds of butter, and 200 gallons of honey. The plantation's distillery produced 6,000 gallons of whiskey, worth $4,500.(US$ in present terms). Wheatlands was used as Winter Quarters for the Union by Tenth Regiment Cavalry out of Michigan and the 8th division from Western Pennsylvania. They ran raids into Sevierville, Gatlinburg and Newport. They sent troops to the Brabson Plantation and took over their Ferry and occupied Bartley Chandler's home in Sevierville as a prison. Two cannons were sent to \\"Battle of Fair Garden\\" and shot over the Rose Glen Plantation. When Southern slaves were emancipated during the American Civil War (1861-1865), Chandler started paying his freed slaves to remain at Wheatlands. Upon his death in 1875, Chandler left his former slaves a portion of land along the south side of Wheatlands known as Chandler Gap. The Chandler Gap community remained a predominantly African-American community well into the 20th century. In 2011, three Pigeon Forge businessmen purchased Wheatlands, and announced plans to restore the house, and possibly re-establish a distillery on the property.Joan Brock, \\"Developers Plan Renovation of Sevier's Historic Wheatlands,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, 27 July 2011.

Historical structures Smokehouse at Wheatlands Original structures at Wheatlands include the mansion house (rebuilt around 1825 after a fire), a smokehouse, the summer kitchen with dining hall, and loom house. A second storage shed and barn have been added more recently. The distillery burned in the late 1930s. The original house, made of clapboard with a large front porch, burned in 1824, and was rebuilt in 1825. Wheatlands is a 2-story, 5-bay brick house with a 1.5-story kitchen and dining room wing attached to the rear to form an \\"L\\" shape. The house is designed in the Federal style, although a Queen Anne-style front porch was added as well as Queen Anne Windows in 1889. The brickwork on the house's front facade uses a Flemish bond, and the brickwork on the sides and rear uses common bond. A brick cornice encircles the house. The interior of the house retains most of its original design elements, which include hand-planed railings and windows. The mantel designs were based on Adamesque models in patternbooks, and include hand-carved details and entablatures. The house is based on a central floor plan, rather than a parlor hall floor plan which was more typical of the period. A frame storage shed built sometime around 1825 still stands a few feet behind the house. The shed, which has beaded weatherboarding, may have once housed a distillery, an ice house, or a loom house. The smokehouse at Wheatlands dates to the first half of the 19th century, and is constructed of hewn logs with a board and batten door.Jones, p. 311.

It is located about east of the main peak of Shuksan and rises to about . It is located in North Cascades National Park and is part of the North Cascades range. Connected to the main peak by the roughly -high Jagged Ridge, Seahpo Peak stands to the north at the headwaters of a headstream of Sulphide Creek, a tributary of the Baker River. Several waterfalls tumble off its flanks, including Seahpo Peak Falls and Cloudcap Falls. (Seahpo Peak is sometimes referred to as Cloudcap Peak.) The mountain is also on the south side of the Nooksack Cirque, which forms the headwaters of the Nooksack River. It is bordered by the East Nooksack Glacier to the north and a few smaller unnamed glaciers to the south. It is also connected to Icy Peak by another unnamed ridge. The mountain derives its name from a French word, chapeau, meaning \\"hat\\". Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Seapho from Ruth Mountain Seahpo Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

Dise√±o del Rancho Johnson History In 1844, Pablo Guti√©rrez (died 1845), a Mexican who had worked for John Sutter since Sante Fe, was awarded the five square league land grant. As required, Guti√©rrez built an adobe house (at the place afterwards called Johnson's Crossing). Guti√©rrez was killed in 1845, and his property sold at auction by Sutter, as magistrate of the region, to William Johnson and his partner Sebastian Keyser (Kayser). Johnson took the east half of the grant, and Keyser the west. In 1846, they built an adobe house a short distance below Johnson's Crossing. Johnson‚Äôs Rancho, as it came to be called, was the last stop on the California Trail to Sutter's Fort. Seven members of the ill-fated Donner Party staggered into this ranch in 1847, seeking help for those left in the snowbound Sierra Nevada Mountains. William Johnson (d.1863) was an English sailor out of Boston who for several years previous to this purchase, had traded between Hawaii and San Francisco. William Johnson The Donner Party:Rescuers and Others In 1847, Johnson married Mary Murphy (1831‚Äì1867), a survivor of the Donner Party, but they were soon divorced. In 1848 Mary married Charles Covillaud, owner of nearby Rancho Honcut, who named Marysville for her. Meriam Marjory Murphy In 1849 Johnson sold his share in the ranch to James Kyle, Jonathan B.

Location Location of the ruins of Burg Marmels Location of the castle terrace Burg Marmels from a sketch from 1893 The ruins of the Grottenburg (a castle built into a naturally occurring cave) Marmels are located on two rocky points high above the embankment dam that formed the Lai da Marmorera near the municipality of Marmorera. The entrance to the ruins is along a path that starts near the dam and then climbs steeply through the woods. The path may require an experienced climber and in wet weather may be inaccessible. Site On the lowest level, there are portions of two sections of the curtain wall which follow the edge of the cliff. Additionally, traces of an overhanging platform and the outer gatehouse can still be seen. The three- story, square keep is located on the southern terrace and rested against the surrounding rock, as can be seen in the sketch from 1893. Only the foundation of the towers of the keep are still visible. The keep had a door and half- round tower on the ground floor as well as another entrance on the next level. These entrances are no longer visible in the foundation. The type and shape of the roof is not known. In the southern wall there was a door that led to a fourth story arbor. A steep path along the rear wall of the grotto leads to the upper level of the castle site. It is clear that there were additional buildings, however, the exact nature or size is not known. The two story chapel is still standing. The lighter plaster that it was covered with, makes it stand out against the rock wall. The half-round apse is built into the eastern wall. The plaster is still in good condition. Both levels of the chapel can be reached from the west side. It is unclear how the inhabitants of the castle would have provided drinking water, as there is no well in the castle site. On a small plateau, north of the chapel, are the ruins of a later building. This structure might have served as housing for the priest. On a small outcrop below the castle, the ruins of a small building have been discovered. This building, located between the castle and the village, may have been a small trading post which allowed local farmers to sell food to the inhabitants of the castle. History It is unknown exactly when the castle was built. The design of the chapel entered R√§tien by the end of the Carolingian era (9th Century) and remained in use until the early 12th Century. Based on the construction of the chapel, the foundation of the castle was likely about 1100. The knights of Marmels were first mentioned as ministerialis, or unfree knights, in the service of the Freiherren (or Baron) of Tarasp in 1160. The castle is first mentioned in 1193. Andreas von Tarasp granted Andreas von Marmels, who already held a fiefdom over half of Tarasp Castle, a position as a ministerialis to the Bishop of Chur. In service to the Bishop, the family was able to expand their land and power. They grew to be one of the foremost minor noble families in R√§tien. In addition to their castle at Marmels, they held Burg Spliatsch as a V√∂gte (or reeve) and the village of Riom. Burg Marmels was first mentioned in 1193 when Andreas von Marmels (or his son with the same name) captured the Cardinal Legate Cintius for the Emperor and held him at the castle. The most important member of the line was Conradin von Marmels (‚Ä† 1517/18) who held titles to Haldenstein and Rh√§z√ºns. During the Swabian War of 1499, he commanded the troops of the Three Leagues against the Habsburgs. However, due to his pro-Habsburg stance he was quickly overthrown and imprisoned. His oldest son, Johannes inherited Rh√§z√ºns and later Neu-Aspermont Castle. His younger son, Rudolf, received Burg Haldenstein, was mayor of Chur and later the primary Landeshauptmann in Veltlin. The castle remained in the possession of the family von Marmels throughout its history, which is quite unusual. The last mention of the castle is in 1550. Conradin's son Rudolf sold the castle, along with the tower of Tinizong and the Burg Spliatsch to his nephew Hans. Hans promptly went in arrears on the debt that he ran up to purchase the castle, and Rudolf bought the castle back from him. At that time the castle was in livable condition. By the 16th Century it was abandoned and in the early 17th Century it had fallen into ruin. An earthquake partly destroyed it in 1905. Unlike most R√§tien nobles, the House of Marmels did not die out. The descendants of the von Marmels now have the last name of Demarmels.

It is bound by the Snake Range and the Deep Creek Mountains to the west and the Confusion Range to the east. The valley is the gateway to Great Basin National Park and Lehman Caves, which is located in the western part of the valley and on the southern Snake Range. People Though it is relatively isolated from civilization today, the human presence in Snake Valley goes back 12,000 years. The oldest accessible evidence of this is the Baker Archeological Site, a Fremont culture habitat maintained by the BLM. Current communities in the valley include Baker in Nevada and Garrison, Burbank, Eskdale, Callao, Partoun, Trout Creek, Gandy, and Border in Utah. Today, the main industries in the valley are farming and ranching, especially sheep ranching. Water Snowpack in the high mountains west of Snake Valley contribute to the (relatively) large amount of groundwater available in the area Snake Valley is noted for a water project involving the Las Vegas Valley,Utah, Nevada agree to split the aquifer, American Water Works Association, Streamlines, September 1, 2009 Volume 1, Number 18 that would target the underlying Basin and Range Carbonate Aquifer, an aquifer that supplies local agriculture and is a relatively large source of water for this region. Though Snake Valley and the surrounding area is arid and part of the Great Basin Desert, the (relatively) high ranges like the Snake Range, Deep Creek Mountains, and the Schell Creek Range allow a large snowpack that recharges the regional aquifer. This 'additional' water manifests itself in the many springs, wetlands, and lakes that make Snake Valley surprisingly lush. Thus, Snake Valley has long been a target of wildlife and farmers, with at least one farm (Dearden Ranch in Burbank, Utah) in continual operation since the 1880s. The most prominent body of water in Snake Valley, Pruess Lake The water development project is proposed by the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA), the water authority that services the Las Vegas area. In the proposal, a pipeline would be built from Snake Valley (and Spring Valley) to supply pumped groundwater to be used as municipal water for the Clark County, Nevada region, with amounts ranging up to per year. Local ranchers and environmentalists have objected to this removal of water from local aquifers, comparing the situation to Owens Valley, California and noting local drawdowns and springs drying up allegedly, but indeterminably, from local agricultural pumping, like at Needle Point Springs. Enhanced demand on the water from locals and enhanced hydrogeologic monitoring have occurred as a result of this proposal, including the USGS's BARCASS study and the Utah Geological Survey's Snake Valley Groundwater Monitoring Program. Both studies have generally concluded that precipitation in the high mountains of the area are the source of the far away but anomalously large springs at Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge. Others support the system, noting the importance to the growth and sustainability of the Las Vegas Valley. The largest advocate for the pipeline has been SNWA General Manager Patricia Mulroy. Mulroy has continuously claimed that this water source must be tapped to keep Las Vegas running. Others agree, and have used New York City as an example of proper water management. New York has relied on water from the Catskills and Hudson Valley region for more than a century, and due to proper management these eco systems continue to flourish, despite the allocation of the water in the Catskills and Hudson Valley.

The spring is not an artesian source, but comes from the Logan River. Ricks Spring is the most well known of several springs in an underground water network of the area. History The first automobile to travel the road to Ricks Spring, circa 1910. Thomas E. Ricks settled in the nearby Cache Valley in 1859. Logan Canyon was an area rich with timber and other resources for nearby settlements. Ricks explorations of The Canyon were some of the first documentations of the area. In 1899 (Brigham Young died in 1877, so the 1899 recommendation would be difficult), at the recommendation of Brigham Young, Ricks and others in the community began constructing a road to Bear Lake Valley. The road to Ricks Spring was the first section to be completed before winter. Within a decade, the area became a popular excursion point for camping and automobiling. The road is now part of the Logan Canyon Scenic Byway, part of US Route 89. Hydrology Since its discovery, people visiting the spring often drank from it, bringing home jugs and barrels of the \\"fresh spring water\\" under the assumption it came from a deep aquifer. They often became sick with giardia indicating the water was not from an artesian source. In the 1950s hydrogeologists noticed a pattern between the flows of the Logan River and theorized a connection between them. In 1972, a severe winter froze the river, jamming it in some locations causing water to fill upstream. Ricks Spring began to flow early that year, and then subsided when the river level dropped again confirming the link between the river and the spring. Later that summer dye tracing was used in the Logan River and the dye was found in Ricks Spring, confirming the water source of the spring. Further dye tracing found that the Logan River is not the only source for Ricks Spring. Several minor streams, located as far as five miles away, and up to 2600 feet higher in elevation, also feed into the underground network that feeds Ricks Spring. Water from Tony Grove Lake also contributes to Ricks Spring. Ricks Spring is only the most well known of several springs in the Logan Canyon area. The other springs, Dewitt Spring, Wood Camp Hollow Spring, Logan Cave Spring, and Benchmark Spring, all have water sources that overlap with at least one of the other springs. Dewitt Spring is a water source for the city of Logan, the other springs, including Ricks Spring all recharge the Logan River. Geology The local rock is made up of sedimentary layers. Pressure and earthquakes have caused the rock to fold and fracture exposing weak points. Over time water flowing through these points eroded through the limestone creating a path from the river and other inflows at high elevation to flow and emit from the spring. There are two caves at Ricks Spring. An above water cave extends into the rock about 25 feet. The second cave is an extensive network of both wet and dry passages that is only accessible by cave diving. , it has been explored to about 2200 feet.

Owned by O2's owners Telef√≥nica, Giffgaff was launched on 25 November 2009.  Products and services  At launch, the first product was a prepaid SIM card providing all standard 2G and 3G mobile phone services, charged on a pay as you use basis. After launch, bundles of minutes, texts and data, called \\"goodybags\\", were introduced. The idea for bundles emerged from the community forums. In June 2012 it was announced that customers would be able to set goodybags to renew automatically once a debit or credit card and subsequently when a PayPal account was saved on their platform payment profile. Voucher payments are accepted for manually purchased goodybags. In 2011, Giffgaff added data-only tethering plans called gigabags to their lineup of product plans. Giffgaff have since retired gigabags, as their goodybag plans now allow members to tether to other devices, within their data allowances without tethering restriction. In March 2014 Giffgaff announced that it would add a line of 4G LTE goodybags available for purchase from April 2014. All 2020 goodybags now include unlimited minutes and texts to standard UK numbers. Full speed data allowances, range from 500MB to 80GB+. Prices listed are between ¬£6 - ¬£25 per month and are reviewed periodically. In August 2020 the Company launched their 9GB Golden Goodybag, to compete directly with its own 6GB Goodybag product, both priced at ¬£10. To be eligible for purchase the member must register a bank payment method and agree to recur their purchase each monthly anniversary. There is no ongoing commitment and the recur can be switched off or cancelled at will. In May 2014 Giffgaff announced that they were now an official Apple carrier, which was closely followed by another announcement that they would soon be stocking iPhones in their online shop ‚Äì this would unlock options on iPhones that would have normally been locked for users, including tethering and voicemail options. iPhone devices went on sale from 4 June 2014, to accompany a wide range of manufacturers including Samsung handsets. Refurbished devices have become a purchase option, with a giffgaff 12 month warranty included. Ratesetter, the peer to peer lenders, have teamed up to offer phone purchase loans to eligible giffgaff members.  Customer service  Giffgaff has no customer service phone lines. Non-account specific problems are raised via an online community system and are answered by other Giffgaff members in exchange for \\"payback points\\" (a virtual currency). Account-specific queries are directed to \\"agents\\", who are contracted by Giffgaff Ltd. to administer account matters. If neither of these avenues resolve the issues, there is a dedicated complaint team, who respond to complaints by email and a dedicated voicemail phone number, written replies can take up to five working days to receive.  Payback  Giffgaff offer payback points to members who recruit other members, suggest ideas on their crowdsourcing platform (giffgaff Labs), as well as those who provide customer service on the giffgaff community. Payback points can be exchanged for real money, airtime credit, or donated to five charities (new 2020) nominated by members and paid out biannually in June and December. Giffgaff promise to match their members charitable donations, pound for pound. Giffgaff is an old Scottish word for 'mutual giving' and the company maintains that ethos, as much as possible.  Super Recruiters  When Giffgaff members recruit 15 new members to join the network, they are promoted to super recruiter status permanently, earning potentially larger rewards depending on their recruit's 2nd and subsequent payments to Giffgaff and ongoing sim retention. Super recruiters are also eligible to receive other benefits, such as dedicated email support, marketing materials, phone calls with employees, and visits to Giffgaff's HQ.  Network service and infrastructure   4G  As of September 2015, all of giffgaff's 'goodybags' come with 4G data included at no extra cost. If the user doesn't have a 4G ready device or is not in a 4G area, the device will connect to O2's 3G or 2G network instead.  5G  Giffgaff are looking to implement a member trial shortly to prepare for their 5G rollout. Existing 4G-compatible Giffgaff SIMs will work in their 5G rollout. O2 rolled out their 5G network access to customers in October 2019, however Giffgaff have stated that they won't have 5G until much later.  Awards  In November 2010, Giffgaff won the Forrester Groundswell Award and was later nominated for the 'Marketing Society's Brand of the Year', losing to the department store John Lewis In December 2010, Giffgaff won the 'Most Innovative Community Award' at the Social CRM Customer Excellence Awards. In June 2012 Giffgaff was named the Best MVNO at the Mobile Industry Awards. In 2014 and 2015 Giffgaff won the Which? best telecom services provider award. In 2018, Giffgaff were a runner-up in the Best Utilities Provider of the Year. In 2019, Giffgaff rated the best network by mobile network customers. Since 2016, Giffgaff has won the uSwitch Network of the Year, for 4 consecutive years. They also won three other uSwitch awards in 2019 for: Best SIM Only Network, Best Network for Data, and Best PAYG Network.  Controversies   Unlimited internet  After goodybags with unlimited internet allowance were introduced, complaints were made to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) from customers who were refused further sale of unlimited plans. The reason given by Giffgaff for their disconnection was a clause in the terms and conditions stating \\"[We may disconnect you] if you do anything ... which we reasonably think adversely impacts the service to other Giffgaff customers or may adversely affect the Network\\". The complaint was not upheld by the ASA who concluded that unlimited internet was advertised correctly. Giffgaff noted that their customer service agents had used the clause above incorrectly and promised to rectify this. Giffgaff have since removed the goodybags in question and replaced their unlimited internet allowance with an \\"Always On\\" data allowance. This means that users will get 80 GB of full speed data usage but after these 80 GB, will be speed-limited to 385 kbps between 8 am and midnight every day.  Advertising campaigns  In May 2013 Giffgaff ran an online and television advertising campaign with the strapline \\"Don't be scared\\" which featured zombies converging on a village. Although the television advert appeared after the 9pm watershed, the ASA received 105 complaints. The ASA did not uphold the complaints, stating that it was not in breach of any BCAP rules. In October 2013 Giffgaff ran two adverts in an online campaign with the strapline \\"Different takes guts\\". The advert featured a crowd of people dressed in white in an empty swimming pool throwing guts at each other. The ASA upheld the complaints that the content was in violation of BCAP rules for harm and offence and also BCAP rule 5.2 because the advert was not suitably age rated. It was recommended that the advert not appear again in its current form. In August 2014, Giffgaff ran three adverts in an online campaign with the strapline \\"At home with your parents you're not the boss\\" which featured siblings being subjected to awkward situations with their parents, one of which was reported to the ASA and featured an adult son walking in on his parents as they were engaged in sexual intercourse. The ASA upheld the complaint that the content was in violation of BCAP rule 4.1 for harm and offence and recommended that the advert not appear again in its current form.

Description and history  Named for its builder and first owner, the colorful J. J. McAlester, for whom McAlester was named, it began in 1870 as a four-room log house. At the time, it was located in Tobucksy County, Choctaw Nation, in the Indian Territory.John W. Morris, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, Plate 38. J. J. McAlester later surrounded the log structure with a single-story house and also built a much larger two-story Queen Anne style house joined by a breezeway to the smaller structure. Its furnishings, many of which remain to this day, reflected the prosperity and position that the McAlester family enjoyed in the community. The building was renovated in 1960 by J. L.

Amtrak ordered the cars to supplement their existing fleet of Amfleet I single-level cars used on shorter distance corridor trains. The design was based on the Comet railcar, a railcar for commuter railroads, but with modifications to make them more suitable for intercity service. Bombardier Transportation built 104 cars from 1988 to 1990 in two basic types: coaches and food service (caf√©) cars. The first Horizon cars entered revenue service in April 1989. The majority of the fleet is currently assigned to the short-haul (300 miles or less) intercity routes out of Chicago that operate under the Amtrak Midwest brand. History In 1988, Amtrak and Bombardier signed a contract for 104 Horizon cars, based on the Comet railcar, built for use on commuter railroads. The Horizon cars allowed Amtrak to add capacity to its fleet quickly since it was adapted from a proven design, and Bombardier Transportation was already in full production of Comet II railcars. Amtrak was also able to finance the Horizon cars privately, making them the first railcars the railroad was able to purchase without securing federal funding. Bombardier delivered the cars between 1989 and spring 1990, from its Barre, Vermont assembly plant in two basic types: 86 coaches and 18 food service cars. The first Horizon cars entered revenue service in April 1989. In 1994, Amtrak considered ordering a further 23 Horizon cars to replace the troublesome gas-turbine Turboliner trainsets used on New York's Empire Corridor service, but the order was never placed.  Design  The design of the Horizon cars was adapted from the Comet I, a single-level commuter coach originally designed and built by Pullman- Standard in 1970‚Äì1973 for the Erie Lackawanna Railroad and New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). Bombardier acquired the rights to the design of the Comet car from Pullman and in 1982 built the second generation Comet II cars for New Jersey Transit. Bombardier made several modifications to make them more suitable for intercity service. They are designed with a maximum speed of and ride on General Steel Industries GSI-G70 outboard bearing trucks, also found on the Superliner II (which were also built later by Bombardier).  Coaches  The 72 standard coaches could seat between 76 and 82 passengers depending on the seating configuration and 14 accessible coaches could seat 72 and included space for a wheelchair. The entire coach fleet was later rebuilt to be accessible, with cars now seating between 68 and 72 passengers depending on the seating configuration.  Food service cars  The 18 food service cars were configured in either a caf√©/club (table seating on one end of the car and business class seating on the other) and dinette (all table seating) configurations.} Both configurations have a food service counter in the middle of the car. The 8 cars in the caf√©/club configuration could seat up to 32 people around dining tables and 19 people in business class seating. The 10 cars in the dinette configuration could seat up to 48 people around dining tables. Routes served International in 1989 , the Horizon coach cars primarily are used on trains based out of Amtrak's Chicago division including the Illinois Service (Carl Sandburg, Illini, Illinois Zephyr, Lincoln Service & Saluki), Michigan Services (Blue Water & Wolverine), Hiawatha, Hoosier State and Missouri River Runner. Additionally, several Horizon cars are assigned to Amtrak's Los Angeles division for use on the Pacific Surfliner route. The California Department of Transportation has also paid to lease and refurbish 3 dinette cars (all table seating) for use as caf√© cars on the San Joaquin route where they are paired with refurbished Comet cars owned by the state. These cars are assigned to Amtrak's Oakland division. Horizon cars are also temporarily assigned to the Amtrak Cascades while the Washington State Department of Transportation and Amtrak prepare to purchase new equipment for the route. These cars are assigned to Amtrak's Seattle division. See also * Shoreliner - Similar cars operated by Metro- North Railroad.

He toured around the Mediterranean taking 1,700 early pictures including Egypt, Greece, the Holy Land and Mount Etna erupting. His last parish was in Gloucestershire.

George Wilson Bridges, 1814, accessed September 2009 Jamaica Mandeville Church was the church of Bridges' second parish He left for Jamaica in 1816 at the invitation of the Governor of Jamaica where he was reportedly paid very well. For most of 1817 he was Rector of St Dorothy. From late November 1817 he was rector of St Mark's church in Mandeville where he was meant to oversee the Jamaican parish of Manchester from 1817 to 1823. Mandeville was a new settlement with a church that was founded in 1816 and the very first official building that they built was the rector's house. Bridges, with the approval of the vestry - one member dissenting - let this house out as a tavern, and was allowed to retain ¬£240 currency of the ¬£300 annual rent.The experience of return migration: Caribbean perspectives, Robert B. Potter, Dennis Conway, Joan Phillips, p. 209, accessed September 2009 In 1823 Bridges became responsible for the neighbouring parish of St Ann. Bridges had arrived in Jamaica with no money at all and by 1823 he was earning over ¬£1000 a year. ¬£400 of this was his salary but the majority came from fees he charged for conducting funerals, marriages and baptisms. He performed thousands of baptisms for money that he obtained from slaves. He was the rector of this parish until 1837. Lecesne in England after the libel case Bridges worked in Jamaica where his books and publications caused difficulties. His annals, volume 2 was the subject of a libel case thousands of miles away in England. The case revolved around two men, Louis Celeste Lecesne and his brother-in-law John Escoffery, who were thrown off the island using powers under an Aliens Act.Full text of \\"Report of the trial of Mr. John Murray : in the Court of King's Bench, at Westminster-Hall, the 19th December, 1829, on an indictment for a libel of Messrs.

The case resulted in the publisher having to withdraw the second volume of the book.Monthly Comments, Jamaica , Ansell Hart, Volume 5. (August 1962 ‚Äì July 1964), accessed September 2009 With the publisher's assistance the volume was amended and reissued. This was not the last time that Bridges' behaviour would be discussed in London. Bridges spoke out against the abolition of slavery and he was an enemy of Methodist missionaries. There was a parliamentary enquiry into a flogging that Bridges had given to a slave as punishment for attending a Methodist meeting.Parliamentary enquiry, concerning a punishment of a slave, accessed September 2009 The case was raised in 1830 in the British House of Commons by Henry Brougham who reported that a girl had been hit by Bridges, flogged by two men at Thomas(sic) Wilson Bridges' instruction. The punishment was for failing to carry out an order. She had complained but the local committee had decided by fourteen to four to take no further action.Henry Lord Brougham, Speeches on Social and Political Subjects, Vol. 2, 1857, p. 204. Bridges later founded a group who tried to throw the missionaries out of Jamaica. In 1834 Bridges' wife left him, taking their son, Henry, for company. Elizabeth left for Britain leaving Bridges with four children to parent. At the time of this estrangement, they had six children. The last child was in England. After some months Bridges returned to England to find his wife and his missing son and daughter. He did not return to Jamaica for over twelve months and he spent some time with Somerset Lowry-Corry who was Earl Belmore and Jamaica's former governor. In February 1836 he received ¬£87 9s 4d as compensation for the financial loss of three Jamaican slaves. This was as a result of the abolition of slavery in the British empire. In 1837 he met the leading British abolitionist Joseph Sturge and it was noted that there was no hostility despite Bridges earlier position.Jamaica St Ann 567, Legacies of British Slave-ownership, UCL, Retrieved 8 January 2016 Canada Bridge's church in Maisemore. In 1837 the separated couple were to face a disaster when a boat accident resulted in the loss of all four of their daughters. Some small consolation was that their son was saved. Bridges and his son turned their backs on England and on Jamaica and set out for Canada. Bridges and his son were there for a number of years and they had an octagonal house built at Lake Rice.Glossary and Explanatory Notes, Catherine Parr Trail notes, Canada Library, accessed September 2009 In 1842, William Bridges was ill so they returned to England. William Fox Talbot Bridges took a new job as rector of St Giles Church in Maisemore in Gloucestershire. where William attended school. It was through a friend of William that Bridges became acquainted with the Talbot family after admiring one of William Fox Talbot's publications. This was the first book printed with photographs and it was made possible by Fox Talbot's invention of the calotype. Bridges became intrigued by the calotype process and persuaded Talbot to support him with photographic paper for a major project. Moreover Talbot allowed Bridges to be instructed in its use even though an American patent was some years away. In 1846 Bridges lent his wooden house at Rice Lake in Ontario called Wolf Tower to Catharine Parr Traill.Catherine Parr Strickland, Canadian Dictionary of Biography, accessed September 2009 This may have been because he had little need for this house as for the next seven years he was to wander through Europe and north Africa taking photographs using the novel calotype technique. In 1847 it was recorded that the Jamaican government would give thirty pounds annually to a Mr Stewart towards the upkeep of the infant son of the Reverend George Wilson Bridges. No explanation is offered. However the government also awarded sixty pounds per year to Bridges himself for 25 years service and because he left because of a \\"calamitous situation\\".The Acts of Jamaica in the year 1847, pp. 81-2, 1848. These monies must have benefited Bridges on his travels. Bridges first stop was Paris where he had a state of the art camera made for himself by an optician named Charles Chevalier. It was there that he met Richard Haight, an American, who used his camera to take pictures in England. In Malta, Bridges met a fellow clergyman Rev. Calvert R. Jones and an entrepreneur cousin of William Fox Talbot's, Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot, who was touring the Mediterranean in his yacht, Galatea. Both of these had been asked to assist Bridges by Fox Talbot. This was not entirely altruistic as Bridges was sending one copy of each exposure back to Fox Talbot so that he could develop the pictures. In return Bridges received more prepared paper. In 1851 he was in Egypt but during his travels he also visited Italy, Sicily, Greece, Turkey, the Holy Land and the rest of North Africa.Egypt, field testing of the first photographic techniques, in French, accessed September 2009 Some of the earliest successful photographs in these countries were taken by Bridges. The negatives from these pictures can achieve several thousand pounds each at auction. Later publications Bridges church in Beachley Bridges became secretary to the Bishop of Bristol, James Monk in 1852 until Monk gave him the position at the village and ferry port of Beachley. In return for forty pounds each year Bridges took care of the Gloucestershire parish and St John's church. Bridges published a number of publications based on the 1,700 negatives that he had gathered. He had tried to sell many whilst in Malta, but there was little profit. When his estranged wife Elizabeth died in 1862 he published a book entitled, Outlines and Notes of Twenty-Nine Years. The 29 years refers to the time from when they parted until her death. Bridges died on 20 September 1863, while still at Beachley parish.

Biography  Rosina's father was the Carinthian noble Ernst von Graben (d. 1513), son of Andreas von Graben (d. 1463), who ruled as burgrave at Sommeregg since 1507. Her ancestors of the House of Graben, a cadet branch of the princely Meinhardiner dynasty, had held large possessions in the Inner Austrian lands of Carinthia and Gorizia (G√∂rz). Andreas had been an official of the Counts of Celje; after their extinction in 1456, his son Ernst had received the Sommeregg estates in Upper Carinthia as a fief from the hands of the Habsburg king Maximilian I. Ernst's brother Virgil von Graben, Rosina's uncle, was a very powerful Austrian noble, Habsburg stattholder in the County of Gorizia and Maximilan's councillor. Sammeregg, engraving by Johann Weikhard Valvasor, 1680 Rosina was born at her father's residence Sommeregg Castle (near present-day Seeboden) in Carinthia. Upon Ernst's death in 1513, she followed him up as burgravine (a sort of Viscountess) of the Sommeregg estates. She became also Lady of Doberd√≤ within the comital lands of Gorizia. Rosina was married twice: first to the ministerialis Georg Goldacher, her second husband was Haymeran of Rain, a member of the Bavarian nobility who was elevated to the rank of a Freiherr zu Sommeregg by Emperor Charles V in 1530. The couple sold Doberd√≤ to the Counts of Attems in 1522 and concentrated on consolidating their Carinthian possessions. However, their eldest son Hans Joachim von Rain returned to Bavaria and in 1550 sold the castle and the lordship of Sommeregg to Christoph Khevenh√ºller, castellan of nearby Ortenburg Castle. Rosina's and her husband Haymeran's tomb chapel is to be found of at the St Michael's Church in Lienz.

Counties with a majority of \\"yes\\" votes in green and counties with a majority of \\"no\\" votes in red. Cannabis in California has been legal for medical use since 1996, and for recreational use since late 2016. The state of California has been at the forefront of efforts to liberalize cannabis laws in the United States, beginning in 1972 with the nation's first ballot initiative attempting to legalize cannabis (Proposition 19). Although it was unsuccessful, California would later become the first state to legalize medical cannabis with the passage of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 (Proposition 215). In November 2016, California voters approved the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (Proposition 64) to legalize the recreational use of cannabis. As a result of recreational legalization, local governments (city and county) may not prohibit adults from growing, using, or transporting marijuana for personal use. Commercial activities can be regulated or prohibited by local governments although deliveries cannot be prohibited. Following recreational legalization, existing growers and suppliers of medical cannabis were required to register, comply with regulations, and apply for permits. Over half of the nonprofit dispensaries legally providing medical marijuana closed. Local agencies have been slow to approve retail stores selling cannabis for recreational purposes with most cities and counties banning retail with a wait and see approach. Many existing growers have been slow to apply for permits as it has been estimated that 60 percent or more of all cannabis consumed in the United States comes from northern California. The export of marijuana to other states remains illegal since the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration considers it a Schedule 1 drug. Reducing illegal activity is considered essential for the success of legal operations who pay the considerable taxes assessed by state and local authorities. Many people do not have nearby retail stores selling cannabis and continue to buy from unlicensed sellers. Illegal growing continues in remote rural areas. Raids and confiscation by law enforcement of illegal retail and grow operations has continued and in some cases stepped up after legalization. California's main regulatory agencies are the Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC), Department of Food and Agriculture, and Department of Public Health. Current state and local regulation Companies must be licensed by the local agency to grow, test, or sell cannabis within each jurisdiction. Cities and counties (unincorporated areas) may license none or only some of these activities. Deliveries by state-licensed firms cannot be prohibited by local jurisdictions as of January 2019 per BCC Regulation 5416. Unlicensed sales were not reduced as fast as many expected. Due to the continued operation of much illegal activity, heavy taxation is an important issue for licensed operators. They are concerned about the perceived lack of sufficient enforcement against illegal activities. The legal market includes the cost of mandatory testing. Authorities warn that the illegal market may contain pesticide or other chemical residues and mold. Other products sold illegally that have not been tested include edible products and vaping pens. Since there are many communities where no stores have been allowed, state legislators have introduced bills that would force many local jurisdictions to allow some retail establishments especially if a majority in the area voted in favor of legalizing cannabis for recreational purposes. Local governments have been critical of the proposal and were joined by a May 2019 editorial in the Los Angeles Times that was critical of this type of legislation. State legislators argue that the lack of access to legal establishments is one reason the illegal sales continue. Besides being licensed by each local agency, the industry is under three different state regulatory agencies. Retailers, distributors and testing labs are regulated by the Bureau of Cannabis Control. Cultivators are under the Department of Food and Agriculture. The Department of Public Health deals with product manufacturers. The California Bureau of Cannabis Control has prohibited the export of marijuana to other states since with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration considers it a Schedule 1 drug. California grows up to five times more than its residents consume by some accounts. Others have estimated that 80% of the crop is shipped out of state. Exported cannabis not only escapes taxation or regulation by California but users in other states will pay a much higher price. Possession Local governments may not prohibit adults from growing, using or transporting marijuana for personal use. An appeals court ruled that inmates who possess small amounts of marijuana in prison are not guilty of a felony crime. Attorney General Xavier Becerra's office had argued that possessing small amounts of marijuana is legally banned in prison which can result in significantly increasing a prisoner's sentence. Cultivation Cannabis is estimated to be the largest cash crop in California with a valued of more than $11 billion. The state provided most of the cannabis consumed in the United States prior to legalization which was intended to provide a transition to legal, licensed growing. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a detailed analysis of the environmental impact of growers operations. Statewide, 208 growers had obtained regular, annual licenses by July 2019. At this point of some 18 months into legalization, 1,532 growers were still operating on provisional permits as they went through the CEQA process that requires extensive paperwork. Smaller farms were given five years to become established under legalization before larger growers were allowed to enter the market. Under the regulations set to expire in 2023, growers can have only one medium licence but there is no limit on the number of small licenses an individual grower can have. This loophole has allowed larger growers to operate. Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties have long been known as Northern California's Emerald Triangle as it is estimated that 60 percent or more of all cannabis consumed in the United States is grown there. Registering and applying for permits has not been an easy decision for many long time growers in these three counties. In Santa Barbara County, cannabis growing has taken over greenhouses that formerly grew flowers. In the first four months of legalization, the county had almost 800 permits issued for cultivators, the most of any county in the state. Calaveras County registered more than seven hundred cultivators after county voters approved a tax in 2016. Trespass grows Unlicensed growing continues in remote rural areas and has expanded according to some law enforcement reports. Raids and confiscation of illegal grow operations by law enforcement has continued and in some cases stepped up after legalization. On-site consumption In July 2019, the West Hollywood approved a cannabis consumption license for Lowell Herb Co, \\"the first of its kind in the nation\\". Lowell Farms: A Cannabis Cafe opened in September 2019 with a menu of cannabis for consumption, THC-infused drinks and meals for cannabis-enhanced sense of taste and smell. It includes the expertise of cannabis sommeliers, known as \\"budtenders\\" on site. A retail establishment, being licensed in Lompoc for on site consumption in December 2019, claims to be the first between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Retail and delivery Stores selling cannabis for recreational purposes have been banned from 80% of the 482 municipalities in California. In September 2019, 873 cannabis sellers had been licensed by the state while the United Cannabis Business Assn. conducted an audit that estimated there are approximately 2,835 unlicensed dispensaries and delivery services based on advertising. Legal retailers say the illegal market is larger than the they are due to the high costs they pay in start-up permit costs and on-going taxes. They complain about the lack of effective enforcement against unlicensed shops. Prior to 2018, about 2,000 nonprofit dispensaries legally provided medical marijuana. Legalization introduced regulations that increased the cost of operation and more than 65% of dispensaries shut their doors. In January, 2018, Los Angeles had no licensed retailers; the closest cities with licensed retail sales were Santa Ana on January 1 and West Hollywood on January 2. Recreational marijuana shops began to open in January 2018, with many districts beginning recreational sales on the first or fifth of January 2018. , 187 dispensaries have temporary city approval in Los Angeles. Los Angeles adopted an ordinance in 2018 to restrict some storefront and billboard advertising after research showed that young adults who lived near dispensaries that had storefront signage used marijuana more frequently than their peers and have more positive views about the drug. Many dispensaries and delivery companies continued to operate under the stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic. With an executive order on March 22, Governor Gavin Newsom declared cannabis one of the enterprises to be an essential business. Special events Organizers of cannabis festivals are required to get permission from state and local agencies. Under the permits, they can let anyone 21 and older buy and smoke weed at the festival. In 2019, Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival in San Francisco became the first major music festival to offer legal cannabis for sale on site. The area was known as \\"Grass Lands\\" and sold more than $1 million in cannabis products such as edibles, vaping cartridges and joints over the three-day event. History Industrial hemp Cannabis was cultivated for fiber and rope as early as 1795 in California, when cultivation began at Mission San Jose under the governorship of Diego de Borica. Cannabis was grown in several regions of Southern California, with two-thirds of it being grown on the missions. California produced 13,000 pounds of hemp in 1807, and 220,000 pounds in 1810. However, in 1810 Mexico began to rebel against the Spanish crown, and the subsidies for growing hemp were cut, leading to a near-disappearance of the crop. A few missions continued to grow it for local use, and the Russian colonists grew hemp at Fort Ross until the station was abandoned in 1841. Psychoactive cannabis Among the early cultivators of cannabis for recreational use in California were Arabs, Armenians, and Turks who grew cannabis as early as 1895 to make hashish for local consumption. Unlike in other states where fears of black or Hispanic use of cannabis drove new restrictions, California was an exception for its focus on South Asian immigrants. A California delegate to the Hague Convention wrote in 1911: Within the last year we in California have been getting a large influx of Hindoos and they have in turn started quite a demand for cannabis indica; they are a very undesirable lot and the habit is growing in California very fast. Criminalization The Poison Act was passed in California in 1907, and in 1913 an amendment(Stats. 1913 , Ch. 342, p. 697) was made to make possession of \\"extracts, tinctures, or other narcotic preparations of hemp, or loco-weed, their preparations and compounds\\" a misdemeanor. There is no evidence that the law was ever used or intended to restrict pharmaceutical cannabis; instead it was a legislative mistake, and in 1915 another amendment(Stats. 1915 , Ch. 604, pp. 1067‚Äì1068) forbade the sale or possession of \\"flowering tops and leaves, extracts, tinctures and other narcotic preparations of hemp or loco weed (Cannabis sativa), Indian hemp\\" except with a prescription. Both bills were drafted and supported by the California State Board of Pharmacy. In 1914, one of the first cannabis drug raids in the nation occurred in the Mexican-American neighborhood of Sonoratown in Los Angeles, where police raided two \\"dream gardens\\" and confiscated a wagonload of cannabis. In 1925, possession, which had previously been treated the same as distribution, became punishable by up to 6 years in prison, and black market sale, which had initially been a misdemeanor punishable by a $100‚Äì$400 fine and/or 50‚Äì180 days in jail for first offenders, became punishable by 6 months‚Äì6 years. In 1927, the laws designed to target opium usage were finally extended to Indian hemp. In 1929, second offenses for possession became punishable by sentences of 6 months‚Äì10 years. In 1937, cannabis cultivation became a separate offense. By 1932, 60% of narcotics arrests in Los Angeles involved cannabis, which was considered \\"much less serious than the morphine cases.\\" In 1954, penalties for marijuana possession were hiked to a minimum 1‚Äì10 years in prison, and sale was made punishable by 5‚Äì15 years with a mandatory 3 years before eligibility for parole; two prior felonies raised the maximum sentences for both offenses to life imprisonment. Popularization In the 1950s and 1960s, the beatnik and later hippie cultures experimented with cannabis, driving increased interest in the drug. In 1964, the first cannabis legalization group was formed in the U.S. when Lowell Eggemeier of San Francisco was arrested, and his attorney established LEMAR (LEgalize MARijuana) shortly afterwards. By the mid-1960s, the Saturday Evening Post was publishing articles estimating that half the college population of California had tried cannabis. One writer commented that usage was: so widespread that pot must be considered an integral part of the generation's life experience. Illicit cultivation In the 1960s‚Äì1970s, people in California had developed the sinsemilla (\\"without seeds\\") method of producing cannabis, uprooting the male plants before they could pollinate the females, resulting a seedless and more potent cannabis. Around 1975, this technique arrived in Humboldt County, which was to become one of the nation's most famous centers of cannabis production. California growers received an unintentional advantage from the US government, which in the 1970s began spraying cannabis fields in Mexico with the herbicide paraquat. Fears of contamination led to a drop in demand for cheaper Mexican cannabis, and a corresponding increase in demand for California-grown cannabis. By 1979, 35% of cannabis consumed in California was grown in-state. By 2010, 79% of cannabis nationwide came from California. Decriminalization Moscone Act (1975) Decriminalization of cannabis ‚Äì which treats possession of small amounts as a civil (rather than a criminal) offense ‚Äì was established in July 1975 when the state legislature passed Senate Bill 95, the Moscone Act. SB 95 made possession of one ounce (28.5 grams) of marijuana a misdemeanor punishable by a $100 fine, with higher punishments for amounts greater than one ounce, for possession on school grounds, or for cultivation. \\"Smoke a joint, lose your license\\" expires (1999) In 1999, a state law was allowed to expire that mandated a six month driver's license suspension for possession of cannabis or other illegal drugs. The law was enacted in 1994 at the urging of Governor Pete Wilson, who argued that the policy kept unsafe drivers off the road and helped prevent illegal drug use. Critics argued that the punishment was excessive and often had nothing to do with the offense committed. The law resulted in as many as 100,000 license suspensions per year according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Proposition 36 (2000) Proposition 36 (also known as the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000) was approved by 61% of voters, requiring that \\"first and second offense drug violators be sent to drug treatment programs instead of facing trial and possible incarceration.\\" Senate Bill 1449 (2010) On September 30, 2010, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law CA State Senate Bill 1449, which further reduced the charge of possession of one ounce of cannabis or less, from a misdemeanor to an infraction, similar to a traffic violation‚Äîa maximum of a $100 fine and no mandatory court appearance or criminal record. The law became effective January 1, 2011. Medical cannabis legalization Early reform efforts (pre-1996) The movement to legalize medical cannabis in the U.S. sprang out of San Francisco in the early 1990s, with efforts soon spreading statewide and eventually across the nation. Proposition P was approved by 79% of San Francisco voters in November 1991, calling on state lawmakers to pass legislation allowing the medical use of cannabis. The city board of supervisors additionally passed a resolution in August 1992 urging the police commission and district attorney to \\"make lowest priority the arrest or prosecution of those involved in the possession or cultivation of [cannabis] for medicinal purposes\\" and to \\"allow a letter from a treating physician to be used as prima facia evidence that marijuana can alleviate the pain and suffering of that patient's medical condition\\". The resolution enabled the open sale of cannabis to AIDS patients and others within the city, most notably through the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club which was operated by medical cannabis activist Dennis Peron (who spearheaded Proposition P and later the statewide Proposition 215). Similar clubs appeared outside San Francisco in the ensuing years as other cities passed legislation to support the medical use of cannabis. The Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana was founded in 1993 after 75% of Santa Cruz voters approved Measure A in November 1992. And the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative was founded in 1995 shortly before the city council passed multiple medical cannabis resolutions. Following the lead of San Francisco and other cities in California, state lawmakers passed Senate Joint Resolution 8 in 1993, a non-binding measure calling on the federal government to enact legislation allowing physicians to prescribe cannabis. In 1994, Senate Bill 1364 was approved by state legislators, to reclassify cannabis as a Schedule II drug at the state level. And Assembly Bill 1529 was approved in 1995, to create a medical necessity defense for patients using cannabis with a physician's recommendation, for treatment of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, or multiple sclerosis. Both SB 1364 and AB 1529 were vetoed by Governor Pete Wilson, however, paving the way for the passage of Proposition 215 in 1996. Proposition 215 (1996) Frustrated by vetoes of medical cannabis bills in successive years, medical cannabis advocates in California took the issue directly to the voters, collecting 775,000 signatures for qualification of a statewide ballot initiative in 1996. Proposition 215 ‚Äì the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 ‚Äì was subsequently approved with 56% of the vote, legalizing the use, possession, and cultivation of cannabis by patients with a physician's recommendation, for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or \\"any other illness for which marijuana provides relief\\". The law also allowed patient caregivers to cultivate cannabis, and urged lawmakers to facilitate the \\"safe and affordable distribution of marijuana\\". Senate Bill 420 (2003) Marin County Vague wording became a major criticism of Proposition 215, though the law has since been clarified through state Supreme Court rulings and the passage of subsequent laws. The first such legislative solution came in January 2003 with the passage of Senate Bill 420 (colloquially known as the Medical Marijuana Program Act). Senate Bill 420 established an identification card system for medical cannabis patients, and allowed the formation of non-profit collectives for provision of cannabis to patients. In 2006 San Diego County filed a lawsuit over its required participation in the state ID card program, but the challenge was later struck down and the city was forced to comply. In January 2010 the California Supreme Court ruled in People v. Kelly that SB 420 did not limit the quantity of cannabis that a patient can possess. All possession limits were therefore lifted.  Implementation and criticism  California was the first state to establish a medical cannabis program, enacted by Proposition 215 in 1996 and Senate Bill 420 in 2003. Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act, allows people the right to obtain and use cannabis for any illness if they obtain a recommendation from a doctor. The Supreme Court of California has ruled there are no specified limits as to what a patient may possess in their private residence if the cannabis is strictly for the patient's own use. Medical cannabis identification cards are issued through the California Department of Public Health's Medical Marijuana Program (MMP). The program began in three counties in May 2005, and expanded statewide in August of the same year. 37,236 cards have been issued throughout 55 counties as of December 2009. However, cannabis dispensaries within the state accept recommendations, with an embossed license, from a doctor who has given the patient an examination and believes cannabis would be beneficial for their ailment. Cannabis evaluations in Venice Beach Critics of California's medical cannabis program argued that the program essentially gave cannabis quasi-legality, as \\"anyone can obtain a recommendation for medical marijuana at any time for practically any ailment\\". Acknowledging that there were instances in which the system was abused and that laws could be improved, Stephen Gutwillig of the Drug Policy Alliance insisted that what Proposition 215 had accomplished was \\"nothing short of incredible\\". Gutwillig argued that because of the law, 200,000 patients in the state had safe and affordable access to medical cannabis to relieve pain and treat medical conditions, without having to risk arrest or buy off the black market. Conflict with federal law Although Proposition 215 legalized medical cannabis in California, at the federal level it remained a Schedule I prohibited drug. Seeking to enforce this prohibition, the Justice Department conducted numerous raids and prosecutions of medical cannabis providers throughout the state in subsequent years. Who grows marijuana and where it comes from were lightly regulated. Federal authorities claimed that these medical marijuana businesses were fronts for the black market. Also rather than growing medical marijuana in small batches for patients, they claimed the cannabis was coming from Mexico or large hidden grows in California. Some state and local officials strongly supported these enforcement efforts, in particular Attorney General Dan Lungren who was a vocal opponent of Proposition 215 leading up to its passage. Other officials, such as San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan, condemned the actions as a gross intrusion into the state's affairs. The raids and prosecutions increased in frequency throughout the Bush and Obama years, until finally in December 2014 the Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment was enacted at the federal level. One of the raids that occurred was at the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana in Santa Cruz in September 2002. WAMM was a non-profit collective set up to provide cannabis to seriously ill patients, and was working closely with local authorities to follow all applicable state and local laws. On the morning of September 5, DEA agents equipped with paramilitary gear and semiautomatic weapons stormed the premises, destroyed all the cannabis plants, and arrested the property owners Mike and Valerie Corral. This prompted an angry response from nearby medical cannabis patients ‚Äì some in wheelchairs ‚Äì who gathered at the site to block federal agents from leaving, until finally after three hours later the Corrals were released. The raid triggered a strong backlash from Santa Cruz city officials as well, who sanctioned an event two weeks later where cannabis was handed out to patients on the steps of city hall, attracting widespread media attention. The DEA was \\"appalled\\" by the event, but took no further action. Further pushback against federal enforcement efforts occurred in June 2003 following the jury trial conviction of Ed Rosenthal, who had been raided by the DEA in 2002 for growing more than 100 cannabis plants in an Oakland warehouse. Because cannabis remained a prohibited substance under federal law, jurors could not be informed that Rosenthal had been deputized by the city of Oakland to grow the cannabis, or even that the cannabis was being used for medical purposes only. Rosenthal was easily convicted as a result; however, immediately following the trial, when jurors found out the true circumstances of the case, they publicly renounced the verdict they had just handed down and demanded a retrial. Judge Charles Breyer, in part influenced by the extraordinary action of the jurors, sentenced Rosenthal to just one day in jail, of which he had already served. In July 2007, a new tactic was adopted by the DEA of threatening landlords renting to medical cannabis providers. Letters were sent to a number of property owners in the Los Angeles area, informing them that they faced up to 20 years in prison for violating the \\"crack house statute\\" of the Controlled Substances Act, in addition to seizure of their properties. This tactic subsequently spread to other areas of California, while DEA raids continued to increase as well in the following years. In October 2011 an extensive and coordinated crackdown on California's cannabis dispensaries was announced by the chief prosecutors of the state's four federal districts. Three major court cases originated in California that attempted to challenge the federal government's ability to enforce federal law in states that have legalized medical cannabis. Conant v. McCaffrey was brought forth in response to various threats made by the federal government against doctors who recommend cannabis to patients. Decided in 2000, it upheld the right of physicians to recommend but not prescribe cannabis. In United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative (decided in 2001), it was argued that medical use of cannabis should be permitted as constituted by a \\"medical necessity\\" ‚Äì but this argument was unsuccessful. In Gonzales v. Raich (decided in 2005), the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act was challenged based on the idea that cannabis grown and consumed in California does not qualify as interstate commerce ‚Äì but this argument was also found to be without merit. Recreational cannabis legalization Proposition 19 (1972) In 1972, California became the first state to vote on a ballot measure seeking to legalize cannabis. Proposition 19 ‚Äì the California Marijuana Initiative ‚Äì sought to legalize the use, possession, and cultivation of cannabis, but did not allow for commercial sales. The initiative was spearheaded by the group Amorphia, which was founded in 1969 (by Blair Newman) and financed its activities through the sale of hemp rolling papers. It was ultimately defeated by a wide margin (33‚Äì67%), but supporters were encouraged by the results, which provided momentum to other reform efforts in California in subsequent years. In 1974, Amorphia ran into financial difficulties and became the California chapter of NORML. Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act (2009) In February 2009, Tom Ammiano introduced the Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act, which would remove penalties under state law for the cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for persons the age of 21 or older. When the Assembly Public Safety Committee approved the bill on a 4 to 3 vote in January 2010, this marked the first time in United States history that a bill legalizing marijuana passed a legislative committee. While the legislation failed to reach the Assembly floor, Ammiano stated his plans to reintroduce the bill later in the year, depending on the success of Proposition 19, the Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act. According to Time, California tax collectors estimated the bill would have raised about $1.3 billion a year in revenue. Critics such as John Lovell, lobbyist for the California Peace Officers' Association, argued that too many people already struggle with alcohol and drug abuse, and legalizing another mind-altering substance would lead to a surge of use, making problems worse. Apart from helping the state's budget by enforcing a tax on the sale of cannabis, proponents of the bill argued that legalization would reduce the amount of criminal activity associated with the drug. Proposition 19 (2010) In November 2010, California voters rejected Proposition 19 (by a vote of 53.5% to 46.5%), an initiative that would have legalized the use, possession, and cultivation of cannabis for adults age 21 and over, and regulated its sale similar to alcohol. The initiative faced stiff opposition from numerous police organizations in the state, while many growers in the Emerald Triangle were strongly opposed due to fears that corporate megafarms would put them out of business. The initiative was also undercut by the passage of Senate Bill 1449 a month before the election. Proposition 19 was spearheaded by Richard Lee, founder of Oaksterdam University. Proposition 64 (2016) Berkeley City Council adopt a resolution to declare the City of Berkeley a \\"sanctuary city\\" for cannabis customers, providers, and landlords On November 8, 2016, Proposition 64, also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, passed by a vote of 57% to 43%, legalizing the sale and distribution of cannabis in both a dry and concentrated form. Adults are allowed to possess up to one ounce of cannabis for recreational use and can grow up to six live plants individually or more commercially with a license. Recreational usage of marijuana became legal under Proposition 64. Immediately upon certification of the November 2016 ballot results, adults age 21 or older were allowed to: * Possess, transport, process, purchase, obtain, or give away, without any compensation whatsoever, no more than one ounce of dry cannabis or eight grams concentrated cannabis to adults the age of 21 or older. * Possess, plant, cultivate, harvest, dry, or process no more than six live plants and the produce of those plants in a private residence, in a locked area not seen from normal view, in compliance with all local ordinances. * Smoke or ingest cannabis. * Possess, transport, purchase, obtain, use, manufacture, or give away marijuana paraphernalia to peoples the age of 21 or older. Users may not: * Smoke it where tobacco is prohibited. * Possess, ingest or smoke within 1,000 feet of a day care, school, or youth center while children are present (except within a private residence and if said smoke is not detectable to said children). * Manufacture concentrated cannabis using a volatile solvent without a license under Chapter 3.5 of Division 8 or Division 10 of the Business and Professions Code. * Possess an open container or marijuana paraphernalia while in the driver or passenger seat of a vehicle used for transportation. * Smoke or ingest marijuana while operating a vehicle used for transportation. * Smoke or ingest marijuana while riding in the passenger seat or compartment of a vehicle.\\"Adult Use of Marijuana Act\\", Retrieved on 12 March 2017. Licenses were issued to allow cultivation and business establishment beginning in 2018. Legal sales for non-medical use were allowed by law beginning January 1, 2018, following formulation of new regulations on retail market by the state's Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation (to be renamed Bureau of Marijuana Control). Proposition 64 is not meant in any way to affect, amend, or restrict the statutes provided for medical cannabis in California under Proposition 215. In 2016, in response to Proposition 64, State Treasurer John Chiang set up a working group to explore access to financial services for legal marijuana-related businesses operating in California, as access to banking services has been a problem due to the additional burdens mandated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on financial institutions to assure that any marijuana related business clients are in compliance with all state laws.

It was described in 2009 from a partial skull found in 1998 from the Dashankou locality of the Xidagou Formation, outcropping in the Qilian Mountains of Gansu, China. The genus is the most basal known member of the clade Therapsida, to which the later Mammalia belong. Description Restoration of the head Raranimus shares a number of features with later therapsids and ancestral Sphenacodontia. The skull consists of a well preserved rostrum. The teeth suggest a carnivorous lifestyle for Raranimus, as the incisors are recurved and the second canines are serrated on their posterior edges. The incisors are morphologically similar to those seen in more derived theriodonts. The presence of two linguo‚àílabially compressed canines is a diagnostic feature of Raranimus. The presence of two functional canines is characteristic of sphenacodontids, and this condition is seen in no other therapsid other than Rananimus. However, the slender, compressed shape of these canines is a derived characteristic of therapsids, with the canines of similarly sized sphenacodontids being more massively built. The precanines are small and anteriorly serrated, similar to what is seen in the synapsids Dimetrodon and Tetraceratops. In the palate region of the skull, the anterior process of the vomer ventrally overlies the premaxilla at the anterior margin of the choana. This overlap is also seen in dinocephalians. However, unlike any other therapsid, the choanae are short and extend only from the level of the fourth incisor back to the first canine. Phylogenetics According to a phylogenetic analysis conducted along with its initial description, Raranimus is considered to be the basalmost therapsid. There has been some controversy as to whether Tetraceratops is a therapsid or a more basal pelycosaur. If Tetraceratops is a therapsid, as has recently been proposed, it would be the oldest and most basal one known, surpassing Raranimus in age by several million years. However, later studies have questioned the placement of Tetraceratops within Therapsida, and the 2009 phylogenetic analysis using Raranimus places the genus outside of the clade. Raranimus occurs in strata that were deposited during the early Roadian stage of the Middle Permian.The hypothesized age for this locality is supported by the presence of the dissorophoid temnospondyl Anakamacops, the bolosaurid Belebey, and the basal therapsids Biseridens, Sinophoneus, and Stenocybus. The sphenacodontids were most diverse before the Roadian in the Early Permian, yet therapsids did not appear as a diverse group until near the Roadian-Wordian boundary. This has left a morphological and temporal gap in the fossil record during which the origin of therapsids must have occurred called Olson‚Äôs Extinction. With the general absence of therapsid remains from Olson's Extinction, different hypotheses have developed in order to explain the group's origins and initial diversification. One theory suggests that therapsids diversified quickly through rapid apomorphy accumulation sometime during the gap, while the other proposes that therapsids evolved gradually over the course of up to 35 Ma. Only recently have remains of basal therapsids such as Raranimus been found from China that occur during Olson's Extinction. Other therapsids that are known to have existed during the gap include Sinophoneus and Stenocybus.

According to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, \\"[by] the spring of 1869 he had induced the Ontario government to build a lock on the Indian River at Port Carling and a canal at Port Sandfield, to allow steamers to extend their runs to lakes Rosseau and Joseph.\\" Cockburn also played a role in passing legislation to have rail service extended to Gravenhurst, one of the other ports served by the Muskoka steamships. Wenonah was abandoned in 1886, in favor of newer vessels. In 2002 a modern excursion vessel, the Wenonah II, was constructed to give passengers the look and feel of a traditional Muskoka Steamship. She was named in honour of the original Wenonah, although her appearance more closely matches vessels like her berthmate, the heritage vessel RMS Segwun, built a few decades later.

Owen ‚ÄúPencilneck‚Äù Garratt (born 1968) is an artist and musician born in Saskatchewan, Canada.  Personal life  Owen Garratt was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, the only child of Gary and Susan Garratt. Gary and Susan divorced in 1971 and Owen lived with his mother until her death in a plane crash in January, 1982. He then moved to Wawota, Saskatchewan to live with his father, who farmed and worked on oil rigs. His father's involvement in the oil drilling industry established the ties that would lead to Owen being persuaded to draw oilfield-related pictures later in his career. Owen attended high school in Wawota until his graduation in 1986. Upon graduation from high school, Garratt returned to Regina to attend the local university. After a year he left university to study music at a nearby vocational music school for two years. He then moved to Calgary, Alberta, drumming with various musical groups throughout his twenties In between musical gigs, he took a sales job selling artwork and met his future wife, Karla Elder. Garratt returned to Regina in 1995 ‚Äì marrying Karla Elder in 2000. His wife became pregnant with the couple's first child, Jackson, in 2001 and they relocated to Spruce Grove, Alberta, 11 kilometres to the east of Edmonton ‚Äì Alberta‚Äôs capital city. They produced two more sons, Hudson Garratt in 2002 and Harding Garratt in 2005. Jackson Garratt died due to choking in 2003. Owen was a contestant on season two of \\"Canada's Greatest Know-it-All\\" on Discovery in 2013, and placed third in the season finale.  Music career  Owen Garratt began drumming at high-school in Wawota. At 15 he began a two-week European tour with a combined U.S. ‚Äì Canadian concert band, and at age 18 was awarded a scholarship to attend a music camp in Evje, Norway. After attending college he went on to play with various bands throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. Although Garratt is now a full-time artist, he still devotes some of his time to playing music. He has recently been involved in co-writing and recording the music for a reality TV show, centred on his own life. Garratt is also the Drum Sergeant for the Spruce Grove Fire-fighter's Pipe and Drum Band.  Artistic career  Due to partial color-blindness , Garratt creates black and white drawings using graphite, chalk and charcoal. His subjects are largely taken from North American culture ‚Äì featuring the oil and gas industries, agricultural scenes, and wild life. He is entirely self-taught, beginning his professional career as an artist after the drawing he produced for his grandmother ‚Äì as a Christmas present ‚Äì was criticised by his then-girlfriend. Garratt believes that ‚ÄúThe world wants its artists to climb above the tree- line, slay the dragon, and come back to tell the tale.‚Äù In 2007, Garratt won a $10,000 first prize at the Los Angeles TV festival with test footage based on a tentative reality TV show called ‚ÄúThe Tales of The Pencilneck ‚Äù, which features Owen engaging in various adventures and creating a piece of art based on the experiences.

Secret was launched as the first female deodorant in 1956, after more than 10 years of research that began in 1945. Secret is the only female brand antiperspirant/deodorant in Procter & Gamble's portfolio of products, which includes male brands Gillette and Old Spice. There are currently more than 55 different antiperspirant/deodorant products sold under the Secret brand. Products are produced by company plants in Greensboro, NC and in Mexico City, Mexico, which are then distributed to retailers. Secret products are sold in a variety of channels, including supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchandisers. They are also available through various online retailers. History Procter & Gamble began research on the product that would be Secret's first in 1945. In 1956, Secret was introduced as a cream that was applied with fingers to the underarm area for underarm odor control. It was the first antiperspirant/deodorant product made for, and marketed to, women. In 1958, Secret introduced a roll-on product, with a spray following in 1964. The solid round stick version was launched in 1978. Early product innovations were driven by the principle that men and women may have different needs when it comes to odor protection, but women should never have to compromise on efficacy. The slogan ‚ÄúStrong Enough for a Man, Made for a Woman‚Äù was developed in the early 1970s and grew to become one of Secret's most famous advertising tag lines. (Reference: P&G; Corporate Archives) The 1980s During the 1980s, Secret adapted the solid antiperspirant/deodorant from a round stick to a wide stick in order to better fit under a woman's arm. Secret also introduced three new scents: Powder Fresh, Spring Breeze and Sporty Clean, to meet growing consumer demand for a variety of scents. By the end of the 1980s, Secret was the leading women's deodorant brand in dollar sales. The 1990s The 1990s brought more innovations with the launch of Ultra Dry and Sheer Dry. These products were proven to provide more strength and protection [than previous versions]. In 1999, Secret introduced Platinum Soft Solid, the strongest over- the-counter form of antiperspirant/deodorant protection available at the time. The 2000s Secret continued product line expansion in the new millennium. Starting in 2001, three new scents were added: Ambitious, Genuine and Optimism. This was followed by the 2002 launches of Secret Platinum Clear Gel and Secret Invisible Solid, with a micronized formula that goes on clear. In 2007, Procter & Gamble introduced Secret Clinical Strength, the first product from Secret promising clinical strength wetness protection without a prescription. In 2008, Secret's scientists developed Secret Flawless, a wetness improvement over the formula featured in their Platinum line. Secret Flawless features proprietary scent renewing technology and movement-activated protection. In 2009, Scent Expressions was launched and featured 11 unique scents. This line of Secret products was designed to meet growing consumer interest in scent-based deodorants. Also launched was the brand's first waterproof deodorant, Secret Clinical Strength Waterproof. In 2010, Secret was one of several brands featured in Procter & Gamble's sponsorship of the 2010 Winter Olympics. The ‚ÄúThank you Mom‚Äù campaign featured athletes and their mothers. Secret worked with Tanith Belbin, Allison Baver and Allison Baver's mother. Secret launched an online campaign, ‚ÄúLet Her Jump,‚Äù which promoted making women's ski jumping an official Olympic sport. 2010 marked Secret's first time working directly with its Facebook fans to name a future product in the Scent Expressions line. In August, Secret launched 3 body splashes within the Scent Expressions line and 2 body mists within Fresh Effects, the brand's first foray into the non-aerosol body spray form. In 2019, Secret launched a new collection, Secret with Essential Oils. Media presence In 2009, Facebook and Nielsen collaborated to provide opt-in polls on Facebook's homepage for brands to collect consumer attitudes and purchasing intent.

Course The Tahuya River originates at Tahuya Lake, west of Green Mountain and northwest of Gold Mountain. Tahuya Lake is fed by two principal streams, Tin Mine Creek and Gold Creek. From the lake the Tahuya River flows south and slightly west. Panther Creek, flowing from Panther Lake, joins the river. Numerous small streams and wetlands drain into the river. Near Hood Canal the river flows becomes braided as it flows through a wetland-dominated valley.

Biography  Alexanr Kharchikov was born on December 21, 1949, in the village of Kensha, in Penza Oblast. He attended primary school in Saransk before enlisting in the Navy. During his naval service he participated in 1968 in the Sinai war between Israel and Egypt, on the Egyptian side, and claims to have been wounded. He graduated in 1974 from the Mordovian state University as an electronic engineer. Kharchikov, now a Saint Petersburg resident, is a leader of the March 17 movement proclaiming the \\"implementation of the March 17, 1991, referendum on future of the USSR\\" as its goal.  Career  Kharchikov achieved notoriety in the 1990s after his participation in a TV broadcast of the program \\"600 seconds\\", after which his cassette tapes and later CDs achieved wide circulation. He has a repertoire of nearly 300 songs, of which those with extreme chauvinist, nationalistic, Stalinist, antisemitic and anti-Ukrainian content became the best known part of his oeuvre, notably the \\"Aryan march\\" (aka \\"White Race\\") (\\"–ê—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –º–∞—Ä—à\\" (\\"–ë–µ–ª–∞—è —Ä–∞—Å–∞\\")), \\"Epistle to the Khokhly\\" (\\"–•–æ—Ö–ª–∞–º\\"), \\"Our Stalin ‚Äì the father, Our Motherland, the mother\\" (\\"–ù–∞–º –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω ‚Äì –æ—Ç–µ—Ü, –Ω–∞–º –†–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞ ‚Äì –º–∞—Ç—å!\\"), \\"Smite the kikes, smite the dandruffed ones!\\" (\\"–ë–µ–π –∂–∏–¥–æ–≤! –ë–µ–π –ø–∞—Ä—Ö–∞—Ç—ã—Ö!\\"), \\"Kikes rule over Russia\\" (\\"–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–µ–π –ø—Ä–∞–≤—è—Ç –∂–∏–¥—ã\\"), \\"Heart's Sorrow\\" (\\"To kikes\\") (\\"–ù–∞ —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ —Ç–æ—Å–∫–∞\\" (\\"–ñ–∏–¥–∞–º\\")), \\"Kill an American!\\" (\\"–£–±–µ–π –∞–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Ü–∞\\"), \\"Finish off that Asian!\\" (\\"–î–æ–±–µ–π –∞–±—Ä–µ–∫–∞\\"), \\"Do you think a Black one would spare you?\\" (\\"–î—É–º–∞–µ—à—å, —á–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π —Ç–µ–±—è –ø–æ—â–∞–¥–∏—Ç?\\").http://ghetto.in.ua/article.php?ID=8&AID;=66 Kharchikov's aficionados, though, regard him as the modern Russia's great Songs of struggle bard. According to V. Vinogradov, he \\"accumulates in himself the energy of resistance and devotes his whole life to the one superior goal: that of fighting for Russia\\". Kharchikov sings in a hoarse voice styled after the Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky, self-accompanied on guitar, or occasionally a synthesizer. Kharchikov's own songs contain explicit exhortations to violence and are described as defined by \\"zoological antisemitism\\". His songs have been used as soundtrack to numerous videos produced by Russian Neonazi groups. Many of these are available on YouTube. Although some see Kharchikov's songs as meeting the prosecutable criteria of Russia's criminal code (such as the articles that cover fomenting interethnic strife), up until January 2010–§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Å–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–æ–≤ –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —é—Å—Ç–∏—Ü–∏–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ he has never been faced with legal action.

The dance, which gained popularity after videos of people practicing the dance were uploaded to popular Internet video sharing websites, such as YouTube, is mainly danced to electronic music, and involves moving the arms and legs loosely while the correct footwork makes the dancer seem to slide on the floor. When dancing Rebolation, several steps are used, and the main move is to \\"walk\\" putting a foot forward and using the heel as a pivot point to turn the back foot backwards, while the front foot is turned inwards around the heel. The reverse movement is used when walking backwards. This, when properly performed, gives the impression that the dancer is somewhat sliding on the floor, and the loose movements of the hands create the impression that the dancer is not totally in control of the direction of movement. This step dance is considered by many dancers as the Brazilian version of Melbourne Shuffle and Hard Style. It is unknown which came first, but a similar type of dance that originated from Johannesburg, South Africa called \\"Stepping\\" or \\"Skitting\\" began in 2006. Unlike 'Rebolation', it did not originate through video sharing websites, such as YouTube, although some dancers have posted videos on the website.

The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) owns the finished painting (G-317), and the oil sketch (G-318). The Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) owns a slightly smaller unfinished version (G-319). All three works depict a pair of nearly naked men engaged in a wrestling match. The setting for the finished painting is the Quaker City Barge Club (defunct), which once stood on Philadelphia's Boathouse Row.Lee Silverberg, A Very Brief History of the Fairmount Rowing Association (Fairmount Rowing Association, 2008). History Eakins painted a series of works depicting scullers on the Schuylkill River in the 1870s.Helen A. Cooper, Thomas Eakins: The Rowing Pictures (Yale University Art Gallery, 1998). In the late 1890s, he painted three major works depicting boxers--Taking the Count (1898), Yale University Art Gallery; Salutat (1898), Addison Gallery of American Art; Between Rounds (1899), Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Oil sketch for Wrestlers (1899). 16 1/16 x 20 1/16 in. (40.8 x 50.96 cm). Los Angeles County Museum of Art On May 22, 1899, Eakins had two wrestlers pose in his 4th-floor studio at 1729 Mount Vernon Street, Philadelphia. Three days earlier, he had written to his friend, sportswriter Clarence Cranmer: \\"I am going to start the wrestling picture on Monday at half past two. I wish you could find it convenient to be at the studio and help us with advice as to positions and so forth.\\"TE to Cranmer, May 19, 1899; cited in an August 29, 1931 letter from Cranmer to Fiske Kimball in the PMA Archives. Siegl, p. 149. The artist's prot√©g√© Samuel Murray may have been present; he modeled a small sculpture of the wrestlers that is also dated 1899. Eakins painted the works from the live models and from a nearly identical photograph, that may have been taken that day. The photograph shows the wrestler on top holding the other in a half nelson and crotch hold.Gordon Hendricks, The Photographs of Thomas Eakins (Grossman Publishers, 1972), plate 229. PMA's unfinished version (G-319) was painted before the finished painting (G-317), and is thought to be an abandoned composition rather than a study.Theodor Siegl, The Thomas Eakins Collection: The Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA, 1978), pp. 149‚Äì50. LACMA's finished painting (G-317) is larger, and features a well-defined setting with additional figures in the background. LACMA's oil sketch (G-318) varies from the other paintings in the position of the head and shoulders of the wrestler on top. Author Allen Guttmann has compared Eakins' Wrestlers to George Luks' The Wrestlers (1905) and Max Slevogt's Wrestling School (1893), writing that all three paintings depict pairs of nude wrestling men lying on the ground in grappling holds.Allen Guttmann, The Erotic in Sports (Columbia University Press, 1996), p. 64. Provenances G-317 Eakins painted the work for the National Academy Museum in New York in 1902 as his so-called diploma painting when he was inducted into membership. 70 years later, the academy sold it to the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio. In 2005, Columbus sold it to Adelson Galleries in New York. In 2006 LACMA acquired it as the gift of Cecile C. Bartman, at one time a museum docent, and the Cecile and Fred Bartman Foundation.Christopher Knight, \\"Eakins' 'Wrestlers' takes a winding road to LACMA.\\" Los Angeles Times, Dec. 25, 2008. http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/25/entertainment/et-wrestlers25, G-319 Eakins died in 1916, and a collection of his unsold paintings was exhibited at the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia. PMA Director Fiske Kimball saw the abandoned version of Wrestlers at the world's fair, and inquired about buying it. According to Kimball, Cranmer (who was acting as the dealer for Eakins's widow) said the abandoned version had been valued low, and had not been included in the Eakins memorial exhibitions of a decade earlier. \\"He [Cranmer] said he would find out the price. It was $400. I bought it and by Christmas 1926 it was hanging in the library at Lemon Hill.\\" Letters from Cranmer to Kimball in the PMA Archives identify the wrestler on top as Joseph McCann, but do not identify the man on the bottom. Kimball died in 1955, and made the abandoned version a bequest to his museum. G-318 William Preston Harrison bought the oil sketch for Wrestlers in 1927, from a touring exhibition of Eakins works.Christopher Knight, \\"Art review: 'Manly Pursuits: The Sporting Images of Thomas Eakins' @ LACMA,\\" The Los Angeles Times, July 26, 2010.

Its purpose was to shorten the laborious and error-prone computations of tide- prediction. Such machines usually provided predictions valid from hour to hour and day to day for a year or more ahead. The first tide-predicting machine, designed and built in 1872-3, and followed by two larger machines on similar principles in 1876 and 1879, was conceived by Sir William Thomson (who later became Lord Kelvin). Thomson had introduced the method of harmonic analysis of tidal patterns in the 1860s and the first machine was designed by Thomson with the collaboration of Edward Roberts (assistant at the UK HM Nautical Almanac Office), and of Alexander L√©g√©, who constructed it.The Proceedings of the Inst.C.E. (1881) contains minutes of a somewhat disputatious discussion that took place in 1881 over who had contributed what details. Thomson acknowledged previous work of the 1840s relating to the general mechanical solution of equations, plus a specific suggestion he had from Beauchamp Tower to use a device of pulleys and a chain once used by Wheatstone; Thomson also credited Roberts with calculating the astronomical ratios embodied in the machine, and L√©g√© with design of the drive gear details; Roberts claimed further credit for selecting other parts of the mechanical design. In the US, another tide- predicting machine on a different pattern was designed by William Ferrel and built in 1881-2.Ferrel (1883). Developments and improvements continued in the UK, US and Germany through the first half of the 20th century. The machines became widely used for constructing official tidal predictions for general marine navigation. They came to be regarded as of military strategic importance during World War I,During World War I, Germany built its first tide-predicting machine in 1915-16 when it could no longer obtain British hydrographic data (see Deutsches Museum exhibit, online), and when it specially needed accurate and independently-sourced tide data for conducting the U-boat campaign (see German Maritime Museum exhibit, online). and again during the Second World War, when the US No.2 Tide Predicting Machine, described below, was classified, along with the data that it produced, and used to predict tides for the D-day Normandy landings and all the island landings in the Pacific war.See Ehret (2008) at page 44). Military interest in such machines continued even for some time afterwards.During the 'cold war', East Germany built its own tide-predicting machine in 1953-5 \\"at unbelievable expense\\", see German Maritime Museum (online exhibit). They were made obsolete by digital electronic computers that can be programmed to carry out similar computations, but the tide-predicting machines continued in use until the 1960s and 1970s.The US No.2 machine was retired in the 1960s, see Ehret (2008); the machine used in Norway continued in use until the 1970s (see Norway online exhibit). Several examples of tide-predicting machines remain on display as museum pieces, occasionally put into operation for demonstration purposes, monuments to the mathematical and mechanical ingenuity of their creators. Background William Ferrel's tide-predicting machine of 1881-2, now at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History Modern scientific study of tides dates back to Isaac Newton's Principia of 1687, in which he applied the theory of gravitation to make a first approximation of the effects of the Moon and Sun on the Earth's tidal waters. The approximation developed by Newton and his successors of the next 90 years is known as the 'equilibrium theory' of tides. Beginning in the 1770s, Pierre-Simon Laplace made a fundamental advance on the equilibrium approximation by bringing into consideration non-equilibrium dynamical aspects of the motion of tidal waters that occurs in response to the tide-generating forces due to the Moon and Sun. Laplace's improvements in theory were substantial, but they still left prediction in an approximate state. This position changed in the 1860s when the local circumstances of tidal phenomena were more fully brought into account by William Thomson's application of Fourier analysis to the tidal motions. Thomson's work in this field was then further developed and extended by George Darwin, the second son of Charles Darwin: George Darwin's work was based on the lunar theory current in his time. His symbols for the tidal harmonic constituents are still used. Darwin's harmonic developments of the tide-generating forces were later brought by A. T. Doodson up to date and extended in light of the new and more accurate lunar theory of E. W. Brown that remained current through most of the twentieth century. The state to which the science of tide-prediction had arrived by the 1870s can be summarized: Astronomical theories of the Moon and Sun had identified the frequencies and strengths of different components of the tide-generating force. But effective prediction at any given place called for measurement of an adequate sample of local tidal observations, to show the local tidal response at those different frequencies, in amplitude and phase. Those observations had then to be analyzed, to derive the coefficients and phase angles. Then, for purposes of prediction, those local tidal constants had to be recombined, each with a different component of the tide-generating forces to which it applied, and at each of a sequence of future dates and times, and then the different elements finally collected together to obtain their aggregate effects. In the age when calculations were done by hand and brain, with pencil and paper and tables, this was recognized as an immensely laborious and error-prone undertaking. Thomson recognized that what was needed was a convenient and preferably automated way to evaluate repeatedly the sum of tidal terms such as: :A_1 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\phi_1)+A_2 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_2 t+\\\\phi_2)+A_3 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_3 t+\\\\phi_3)+\\\\ldots containing 10, 20 or even more trigonometrical terms, so that the computation could conveniently be repeated in full for each of a very large number of different chosen values of the date/time t. This was the core of the problem solved by the tide-predicting machines. Principle Thomson conceived his aim as to construct a mechanism that would evaluate this trigonometrical sum physically, e.g. as the vertical position of a pen that could then plot a curve on a moving band of paper. mechanism for generating sinusoidal motion component There were several mechanisms available to him for converting rotary motion into sinusoidal motion. One of them is shown in the schematic (right). A rotating drive-wheel is fitted with an off-center peg. A shaft with a horizontally-slotted section is free to move vertically up and down. The wheel's off-center peg is located in the slot. As a result, when the peg moves around with the wheel, it can make the shaft move up and down within limits. This arrangement shows that when the drive-wheel rotates uniformly, say clockwise, the shaft moves sinusoidally up and down. The vertical position of the center of the slot, at any time t, can then be expressed as A_1 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\phi_1), where A_1 is the radial distance from the wheel's center to the peg, \\\\omega_1 is the rate at which the wheel turns (in radians per unit of time), and \\\\phi_1 is the starting phase angle of the peg, measured in radians from the 12 o'clock position to the angular position where the peg was at time zero. This arrangement makes a physical analog of just one trigonometrical term. Thomson needed to construct a physical sum of many such terms. At first he inclined to use gears. Then he discussed the problem with engineer Beauchamp Tower before the British Association meeting in 1872, and Tower suggested the use of a device that (as he remembered) was once used by Wheatstone. It was a chain running alternately over and under a sequence of pulleys on movable shafts. The chain was fixed at one end, and the other (free) end was weighted to keep it taut. As each shaft moved up or down it would take up or release a corresponding length of the chain. The movements in position of the free (movable) end of the chain represented the sum of the movements of the different shafts. The movable end was kept taut, and fitted with a pen and a moving band of paper on which the pen plotted a tidal curve. In some designs, the movable end of the line was connected instead to a dial and scale from which tidal heights could be read off. Thomson's design for the third tide- predicting machine, 1879-81 One of Thomson's designs for the calculating part of a tide-predicting machine is shown in the figure (right), closely similar to the third machine of 1879-81. A long cord, with one end held fixed, passed vertically upwards and over a first upper pulley, then vertically downwards and under the next, and so on. These pulleys were all moved up and down by cranks, and each pulley took in or let out cord according to the direction in which it moved. These cranks were all moved by trains of wheels gearing into the wheels fixed on a drive shaft. The greatest number of teeth on any wheel was 802 engaging with another of 423. All the other wheels had comparatively small numbers of teeth. A flywheel of great inertia enabled the operator to turn the machine fast, without jerking the pulleys, and so to run off a year's curve in about twenty-five minutes. The machine shown in the figure was arranged for fifteen constituents in all. Thomson acknowledged that the use of an over-and-under arrangement of the flexible line that summed the motion components was suggested to him in August 1872 by engineer Beauchamp Tower.Beauchamp Tower was initially referred to in Thomson's acknowledgements only as 'Mr Tower', but he was more fully identified in discussion between Thomson and E Roberts at the Institution of Civil Engineers (reported in the ICE minutes in the Proceedings, 1881). History The first tide predicting machine, designed in 1872 and of which a model was exhibited at the British Association meeting in 1873See Proceedings of the Inst.C.E. (1881), at page 31. (for computing 8 tidal components), followed in 1875-6 by a machine on a slightly larger scale (for computing 10 tidal components), was designed by Sir William Thomson (who later became Lord Kelvin).see W Thomson (1881), a paper of Thomson's presented to the Institution of Civil Engineers in January 1881. Subsequent discussion at the same meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers covered questions of history and priority about aspects of the design since 1872, see Proceedings for January 1881 especially pages 30-31. The design had been described at the British Association Meeting of 1872 and a model for an 8-component prototype shown at the British Association meeting of 1873. The 10-component machine and results obtained from it were shown at the Paris Exhibition in 1878. An enlarged and improved version of the machine, for computing 20 tidal components, was built for the Government of India in 1879, and then modified in 1881 to extend it to compute 24 harmonic components.The 20-component instrument was described by E Roberts (1879). In these machines, the prediction was delivered in the form of a continuous graphical pen-plot of tidal height against time. The plot was marked with hour- and noon-marks, and was made by the machine on a moving band of paper as the mechanism was turned. A year's tidal predictions for a given place, usually a chosen seaport, could be plotted by the 1876 and 1879 machines in about four hours (but the drives had to be rewound during that time). In 1881-2, another tide predicting machine, operating quite differently, was designed by William Ferrel and built in Washington under Ferrel's direction by E. G. Fischer (who later designed the successor machine described below, which was in operation at the US Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1912 until the 1960s).W Ferrel (1883); also E G Fischer (1912), at pages 273-275; also Science (1884). Ferrel's machine delivered predictions by telling the times and heights of successive high and low waters, shown by pointer-readings on dials and scales. These were read by an operator who copied the readings on to forms, to be sent to the printer of the US tide-tables. These machines had to be set with local tidal constants special to the place for which predictions were to be made. Such numbers express the local tidal response to individual components of the global tide- generating potential, at different frequencies. This local response, shown in the timing and the height of tidal contributions at different frequencies, is a result of local and regional features of the coasts and sea-bed. The tidal constants are usually evaluated from local histories of tide-gauge observations, by harmonic analysis based on the principal tide-generating frequencies as shown by the global theory of tides and the underlying lunar theory. Thomson was also responsible for originating the method of harmonic tidal analysis, and for devising a harmonic analyzer machine, which partly mechanized the evaluation of the constants from the gauge readings. Development and improvement based on the experience of these early machines continued through the first half of the 20th century. British Tide Predictor No.2, after initial use to generate data for Indian ports, was used for tide prediction for the British empire beyond India, and transferred to the National Physical Laboratory in 1903. British Tide Predictor No.3 was sold to the French Government in 1900 and used to generate French tide tables. Tide- Predicting Machine No. 2 (\\"Old Brass Brains\\"). The operator powered the machine by turning the crank at the left. The machine stopped when the simulation reached high and low tides, at which time the operator recorded the tide height and the day and time from the dials on the machine's face. The tide curve drawn on the paper above the dials was retained in case questions were raised later about the calculations. US Tide Predicting Machine No. 2 (\\"Old Brass Brains\\")See Ehret, 2008 for its later history, and for its construction E G Fischer, and (1915) Description of the US Tide Predicting Machine No 2, see also NOAA. was designed in the 1890s, completed and brought into service in 1912, used for several decades including during the second World War, and retired in the 1960s. Tide-predicting machines were built in Germany during World War I, and again in the period 1935-8.See German Maritime Museum online exhibit, and Deutsches Museum online exhibit. Three of the last to be built were: * a TPM built in 1947 for the Norwegian Hydrographic Service by Chadburn of Liverpool, and designed to compute 30 tidal harmonic constituents; used until 1975 to compute official Norwegian Tide Tables, before being superseded by digital computing.Norwegian Hydrographic Service - history. * the Doodson-L√©g√© TPM built in 1949, * an East German TPM built 1953-5.See German Maritime Museum (online exhibit). Excluding small portable machines, a total of 33 tide-predicting machines are known to have been built, of which 2 have been destroyed and 4 are presently lost.See P. L. Woodworth (2016): An inventory of tide prediction machines. National Oceanography Centre Research and Consultancy Report No. 56. Display and demonstration They can be seen in London,The first complete tide-predicting machine, from 1872-3, by Thomson with contributions from Tower, Roberts, and L√©g√©, is at the Science Museum, South Kensington, London. Washington,The first US tide-predicting machine by Ferrel, 1881-2, is exhibited at The Smithsonian National Museum of American History; and the second US tide-predicting machine, which gained the nickname \\"Old Brass Brains\\" (see Ehret, 2008), is exhibited at the NOAA offices in Silver Spring, MD (NOAA is the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration). Liverpool,The Roberts-L√©g√© and Doodson-L√©g√© machines are exhibited in the Tide and Time exhibition at the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, UK. and elsewhere, including the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Online An online demonstration is available to show the principle of operation of a 7-component version of a tide- predicting machine otherwise like Thomson's (Kelvin's) original design.See American Mathematical Society/Bill Casselman (2009), animated JAVA simulation based on Kelvin's Tide Predicting Machine (the animation shows computing 7 harmonic components). The animation shows part of the operation of the machine: the motions of several pulleys can be seen, each moving up and down to simulate one of the tidal frequencies; and the animation also shows how these sinusoidal motions were generated by wheel rotations and how they were combined to form the resulting tidal curve. Not shown in the animation is the way in which the individual motions were generated in the machine at the correct relative frequencies, by gearing in the correct ratios, or how the amplitudes and starting phase angles for each motion were set in an adjustable way. These amplitudes and starting phase angles represented the local tidal constants, separately reset, and different for each place for which predictions were to be made. Also, in the real Thomson machines, to save on motion and wear of the other parts, the shaft and pulley with the largest expected motion (for the M2 tide component at twice per lunar day) was mounted nearest to the pen, and the shaft and pulley representing the smallest component was at the other end, nearest to the point of fixing of the flexible cord or chain, to minimize unnecessary motion in the most part of the flexible cord.

The most famous IM is the so-called Shannon-entropy (1948), which determines how much additional information the observer still requires in order to have all the available knowledge regarding a given system S, when all he/she has is a probability density function (PD) defined on appropriate elements of such system. This is then a \\"missing\\" information measure. The IM is a function of the PD only. If the observer does not have such a PD, but only a finite set of empirically determined mean values of the system, then a fundamental scientific principle called the Maximum Entropy one (MaxEnt) asserts that the \\"best\\" PD is the one that, reproducing the known expectation values, maximizes otherwise Shannon's IM.  Fisher's information measure  Fisher's information (FIM), named after Ronald Fisher, (1925) is another kind of measure, in two respects, namely, 1) it reflects the amount of (positive) information of the observer, 2) it depends not only on the PD but also on its first derivatives, a property that makes it a local quantity (Shannon's is instead a global one). The corresponding counterpart of MaxEnt is now the FIM-minimization, since Fisher's measure grows when Shannon's diminishes, and vice versa. The minimization here referred to (MFI) is an important theoretical tool in a manifold of disciplines, beginning with physics. In a sense it is clearly superior to MaxEnt because the later procedure yields always as the solution an exponential PD, while the MFI solution is a differential equation for the PD, which allows for greater flexibility and versatility.  Applications of the MFI   Thermodynamics  Much effort has been devoted to Fisher's information measure, shedding much light upon the manifold physical applications.B. R. Frieden, in Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics, edited by P. W. Hawkes, Academic, New York, 1994, Vol. 90, pp. 123204.R. N. Silver, in E. T. Jaynes: Physics and Probability, edited by W. T. Grandy, Jr. and P. W. Milonni, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, 1992. As a small sample, it can be shown that the whole field of thermodynamics (both equilibrium and non-equilibrium) can be derived from the MFI approach. Here FIM is specialized to the particular but important case of translation families, i.e., distribution functions whose form does not change under translational transformations. In this case, Fisher measure becomes shift- invariant. Such minimizing of Fisher's measure leads to a Schr√∂dinger-like equation for the probability amplitude, where the ground state describes equilibrium physics and the excited states account for non-equilibrium situations.  Scale-invariant phenomena  More recently, Zipf's law has been shown to arise as the variational solution of the MFI when scale invariance is introduced in the measure, leading for the first time an explanation of this regularity from first principles. It has been also shown that MFI can be used to formulate a thermodynamics based on scale invariance instead of translational invariance, allowing the definition of the Scale-Free Ideal Gas, the scale invariant equivalent of the Ideal Gas.

They are widely distributed and commonly found on decaying wood. The plasmodium often appears as white frost-like growth or thin watery layers on wood. Pillar or wall-like sporangia bud from the plasmodium and develop spores that undergo multiple divisions before they release flagellated zoospores. The zoospores will then pair off, undergo plasmogamy, and form zygotes that will later form new plasmodia. The genus currently contains 4 species. The most notable member is Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa, a slime mould found in most parts of the world. Other known species of Ceratiomyxa are mostly found in the tropics.  Etymology  Ceratiomyxa comes from the Latin word ceratus meaning \\"waxed\\" and the ancient Greek word myxa meaning \\"mucus\\".  History of Knowledge  Ceratiomyxa was first described under the name Puccinia ramose (later revised to Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa) in 1729 by Pier Antonio Micheli, a pioneer of mycology. In 1805, Albertini and Schweinitz described 2 more species in the genus, C. hydnoides and C. porioides. However, because Ceratiomyxa species can take a variety of different forms, many forms first described as species are later considered synonyms. This includes C. hydnoideum and C. porioides which are now often considered synonyms of C.fruticulosa.1,2 Ceratiomyxa was first placed in the subclass Ceratiomyxomycetidae of the class Myxomycetes by Martin and Alexopoulos in 1969, but was later moved to subclass Protostelia of the class Eumycetozoa by Olive in 1970.1,2  Habitat and Ecology  Ceratiomyxa is commonly found on rotting wood. Large logs and stumps are cited as ideal substrates for growth, although smaller colonies can also be found a tree branches. The Ceratiomyxa collection of Henry C. Gilbert has specimen growing on various evergreen coniferous trees (Pseudotsuga), elm (Ulmus), maple (Acer), oak (Quercus), Tilia, and willows (Salix). A specimen collected by F. O. Grover was found growing on a burlap sack.1 Species of Ceratiomyxa can be found world-wide. C. fruticulosa is the most common species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. C. morchella and C.sphaerasperma have only been recorded in the tropics.3  Morphology  Plasmodium: Net-like or thin layer enveloped in mucous. Often translucent or white in colour but can also be tinted slightly yellow, pink, or blue-green. The protoplasm within the plasmodium can be seen flowing, resting, and resuming flow in the opposite direction. This occurs in intervals of approximately 40 seconds. Protoplasmic flow slows as the sporangia develop and halt completely during mitosis.1 Sporangia: Can be found in many different forms. Common forms include: * Simple pillar: Pillar-like projections. In some species, pillars expand at the base and fuse to form a layer of plasmodium * Fruticulus: Clusters of finger- like projections that are usually undivided1 * Arbuscula: Branched resembling small trees. Spores develop on branch surfaces * Filiforme: Long and slender pillars * Porioides: Net-like formations of walls. Spores develop on sides and edges of wall Spores: The spores are round or oval globules individually attached to stalks sprouting from sporangia. Spores vary in size (8-13 ¬µ in diameter). The spore walls are thin and transparent. Spores appear grainy and may have some vacuoles which are often near the perimeter or surrounding the nucleus. The nucleus within the spore is about 3 ¬µ in diameter.1 Swarmcells: Oblong with either one long flagellum, one long and one short flagellum, or 2 long flagella. The flagella may occur together or at opposite ends of the cell. Upon emergence, the swarmcells are 6-8 ¬µ in length and can develop to around 12 ¬µ in older cells.1  Life Cycle  Ceratiomyxa plasmodia is diploid and can often be found emerging from rotting wood and spreading into a thin layer. The plasmodium then fruits to form sporangia: erect pillar or wall-like structures. The sporangia mature in about six hours. Many small stalks emerge from the sporangia to form protospores. Meiosis then begins in the protospores. Synapsis of the chromosomes in prophase is achieved at this stage. After the stalks have fully elongated, a thin transparent wall is secreted around the protospores to become spores. Spores take approximately 24 hours to mature. The first meiotic division is then completed in the spores followed by a second meiotic division which leaves the spore with 4 nuclei. After dispersal, these four-nucleate spores germinate and naked protoplasts emerge. The protoplasts take in water upon emergence and enlarge to about 3 times the size of the spore from which they emerged. The protoplasts then form short thread-like filaments that later retract back into round globules. In some cases, the protoplast skips the thread phase and remains isodiametric. The nuclei then migrate to four points of a tetrahedron and the protoplast cleaves into a tetrad of lobes. Soon after, the tetrad undergoes mitosis and splits again into an octette of haploid cells. Each cell releases a swarmcell with either one long flagellum, 2 unequal flagella, or 2 long flagella. The flagella are apical and whiplash type. The swarmcells may then lose their flagella and become asexual myxamoebae or undergo syngamy in pairs to produce a diploid zygote.1,2  List of Species  Genus Ceratiomyxa currently includes 4 species: * Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa Micheli, 1729 * Ceratiomyxa sphaerosperma Boedijn, 1927 * Ceratiomyxa morchella Weldon, 1954 * Ceratiomyxa hemisphaerica Olive and Stoianovitch, 1979  References  1 Gilbert, H., C. 1935: Critical events in the life history of Ceratiomyxa.

The Thaayorre language region includes the landscape within Pormpuraaw Community Council and the Cook Shire Council. The area originally was set up as the Edward River Mission in 1938. Aboriginal people from the region were gradually drawn from their traditional lands into the mission settlement. In 1967 the Anglican church were no longer able to sustain their activities in the area as a Church Mission. The Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, a government department, under the Act continued running the affairs of the community. On 28 July 1987, under the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984, a Deed of Grant in Trust was given to the Pormpuraaw community. Like other DOGIT communities of the time, Pormpuraaw had a town Council elected by Aboriginal people living in the community. The newly formed Pormpuraaw Council assumed responsibility for implementing certain conditions of the DOGIT. Four elected Aboriginal residents plus a mayor hold four year terms of office. Responsibilities As the Shire is not operated under the Local Government Act and operates the land on behalf of the community, the Shire Council's responsibilities are quite different from a typical local government body. This includes responsibility for fisheries, alcohol management and even operation of some commercial enterprises. The Pormpuraaw Shire Council operates an Indigenous Knowledge Centre at Pormpuraaw.

The name Mapledurwell means 'maple tree spring.' History Recorded in the Domesday Book, the land was held by Anschill for Edward the Confessor. From 1086 it became the sole Hampshire estate of Hugh de Port, covering the parishes of Newnham, Up Nately and Andwell. Forfeited by Adam de Port in 1172, after the King gave the manor to Alan Basset, it was transferred to Hugh de Despenser in 1306, who was hanged by Queen Isabel in 1326. Returned to the Despenser family in 1337, it remained in their possession for two centuries. In 1528 William Frost of Avington granted the manor to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, which remained the major land owner until 1839. This later long period of ownership resulted in the continuation of small tenant farm holdings, and hence the relatively late enclosure of the farmlands, and retention of an open land setting and older \\"twisty\\" road layout. The present area of allotment land was awarded to the village under and Enclosure act of June 1863. The opening of the Basingstoke Canal from 1778, which ran through the northern half of Up Nateley, and the expansion of the nearby brickworks brought many industrial jobs to the area. Governance The village of Mapledurwell is part of the civil parish of Mapledurwell and Up Nately and is part of the Basing ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council.

Its species are aquatic, feeding on algae and appearing in waters of a wide range of temperatures and salinities, and are 15-50 micrometers long. They can interchange between flagellated and amoeboid forms, and are notable for being covered in both spiny and flattened siliceous scales.  Etymology  The genus was named by Robert Lauterborn in 1899. Thauma in Greek can mean ‚Äòmiracle,‚Äô ‚Äòwonder,‚Äô or ‚Äòmarvel,‚Äô while mastix is a suffix (also Greek-derived) that can be used to mean ‚Äòscourge‚Äô or ‚Äòwhip,‚Äô which may refer to the organism‚Äôs flagella.  History of knowledge  The genus was first identified in 1899 by Robert Lauterborn, a German protozoologist. Since then several new species have been discovered within the genus. However, analyses of ribosomal DNA have indicated that Thaumatomastix may in fact be a paraphyletic group, and have resulted in seven species (T. formosa, T. fragilis, T. fusiformis, T. groenlandika, T. igloolica, T. spinosa, and T. splendida) being reclassified under the genus Reckertia in 2011. It has also been recently suggested that the genus be split into three separate genera, with the others being Ovaloplaca and Thaumatospina.  Habitat and ecology  Thaumatomastix is found in marine and freshwater environments, over a wide range of salinities and temperatures. Though organisms may be found amidst plankton, they most often occur in sediments. Comparison of their ribosomal DNA sequences with cloned partial sequences has indicated that they can survive in suboxic or even anoxic environments. Thaumatomastix are phagotrophs, with some known to feed on algae. Many species have been primarily observed via whole mounts rather than living samples, and much about their behavior in their natural environment remains unknown. In culture, they have been noted to thrive in samples where suspended sediment particles are allowed to settle.  Description  A typical organism of the genus Thaumatomastix is single-celled and heterotrophic, with a 15-50 micrometer body covered in siliceous scales and spines. The body scales can be triangular or elliptical plates, while the spines vary in length between species and are even bifurcated in the case of T. bipartita. The elliptical plates consist of two fused disks with a varying number of perforations, while the spines have three ridges and a collar-like structure near the proximal plate. Scales are produced by silica deposition vesicles, which remain invaginated in or close to the cell‚Äôs mitochondria during their development. Once a scale is fully formed, its vesicle will move to the cell membrane to deposit it there. Thaumatomastix are biflagellate, with one flagellum being longer than the cell itself, and move around by swimming or gliding. The two flagella emerge from a short furrow at the anterior end of the cell; the shorter one is armored by scales while the longer one is not. Though present in most species, flagella have not been observed in T. tauryanini as of 2012. In addition to a large anterior nucleus, Thaumatomastix possess one or more vacuoles. Cylindrical structures similar to ejectosomes, contained within vesicles just below the plasma membrane, have also been observed in some species. Thaumatomastix can produce pseudopodia from the ventral surface of their body in order to feed and will sometimes change from flagellated cells to amoeboid cells and back. As amoeboids, they possess branching pseudopodia which they can use to move across a substrate. Many of these characteristics are shared by the closely related genus Thaumatomonas. However, Thaumatomastix differs in that it has flagellar scales and a longer anterior flagellum. Genetic analysis suggests that Thaumatomastix is paraphyletic and may need to be divided into multiple genera. Those with oval-shaped plate scales (Ovoplaca) are closely related to another newly discovered genus, Scutellomonas, which also has oval-shaped scales but does not have spines. This does not hold true for Thaumatomastix with triangular scales, and as a result there is currently some uncertainty as to which species still belong in the genus. Based on the new proposed phylogeny, Thaumatomastix itself would be reduced to contain only the three freshwater species with triangular scales, which are distinguished by a thicker cell boundary layer than their marine relatives.  List of species  Nine species are currently recognized in the genus Thaumatomastix as of 2012. *Thaumatomastix bipartita Beech & Moestrup, 1986 *Thaumatomastix dybsoeana Thomsen, H√§llfors, H√§llfors & Ik√§valko, 1993 *Thaumatomastix patelliformis (Takahashi & Hara) Beech & Moestrup, 1986 *Thaumatomastix punctata Thomsen ex V√∏rs *Thaumatomastix sagittifera (Conrad) Beech & Moestrup, 1986 *Thaumatomastix salina (Birch-Andersen) Beech & Moestrup, 1986 *Thaumatomastix setifera (Lauterborn) Lemmermann, 1908 *Thaumatomastix thomseni Tong, 1997 *Thaumatomastix tripus (Takahashi & Hara) Beech & Moestrup, 1986 References Category:Cercozoa genera ","title":"Thaumatomastix"},{"id":"24474832","text":"Ebria is a genus of rhizaria.

Lt. Harry C. Crist, USNR, in command. The interim group of 12 LSM(R)s transited the Panama Canal and via San Diego, Honolulu, and the Philippines, headed for battle against Japan in March 1945. Unaware of their destination, the crews were nonetheless well equipped and trained. In a preliminary assault on 26 March 1945, they laid down a rocket barrage at dawn on Kerama Retta, a small cluster of islands off the southwestern shore of Okinawa, to allow US Marines to land and secure the islands and the harbor for protection of the hospital, supply and communication ships, and floating drydocks. The early dawn assault surprised the Japanese; the marines took control with a minimum of casualties and established this haven for damaged ships. Service History (Turner) During World War II LSM(R) 188 was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific theater. At that time the fleet was under the command of Admiral Spruance and named the Fifth fleet. Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner was Commander of Amphibious Forces Pacific and was to be in charge of operations until the beachhead was established. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats attacked the but were promptly destroyed. The northern half of the six- mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 53, under the command of Rear Admiral Lawrence F. Reifsnider. The LSMR's involved in the invasion on 1 April 1945 as part of the Northern Tractor Flotilla included , , , , , and . The southern half of the six-mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 55, commanded by Rear Admiral John Leslie Hall, Jr. The assault troops were under Major General John R. Hodge. The southern support craft included , , , , and . On 3 May 1945 the Japanese launched their fifth kikusui attack. Picket station 10 was the hardest hit. Shortly before dusk, the destroyer was hit by a series of six kamikazes, suffering 45 killed or missing and 49 wounded. The ship survived, but was later decommissioned because it wasn't worth repairing. About the same time, approximately 20 planes attacked destroyer . She was crashed by four of them and sank within 12 minutes of the first hit. She lost 30 dead or missing and 79 wounded. LSM(R)-195 was also on Picket Station 10 and while rushing to the aid of the Aaron Ward and the Little was likewise crashed by a kamikaze. The crash started her rockets exploding and knocked out the fire main and auxiliary pumps. LSM-195 had to be abandoned and, after being ripped by heavy explosions, sank. On 4 May LSM(R)-190 was patrolling at Picket Station 12. Not long after sunrise the anticipated kamikazes arrived and were met by American combat air patrol. Several of the Japanese planes managed to get through and attack the ships on this station. Three kamikazes crashed LSM(R)-190. The ship that had seen so much previous action and had been credited with rescuing 180 survivors of other stricken ships was herself sunk. In the same attack the destroyer was sunk, carrying 126 of her 312 officers and men with her. At the same time as LSM(R)-190 was fighting her final battle, LSM(R)-194 was facing the same fate at Picket Station 1. This was the most critical station on the picket line. The capture of the Kerama Islands did not come without a price. On the night of 28 March, Japanese planes from Okinawa airfields made a special attack on the small patrol craft assembled between the islands and Okinawa. About a dozen were shot down, but one crashed into LSM(R)-188. There were 15 men killed and another 32 wounded. The badly damaged ship survived, but she was sent back to Pearl Harbor and saw no further combat. The Okinawa Radar Picket Line ( C.T.G. 52.21) The American plan for defense against the kamikazes was to have fighters intercept the Japanese as early as possible. Sixteen radar picket stations were established around the island, in some cases almost 100 miles out, to give early warning of the Japanese planes which might be coming from any direction. Each station was manned around the clock by a handful of ships ranging from destroyers down to minesweepers. Their job was to sound the alarm and vector fighters to intercept before the Japanese could attack the fleet anchored off Okinawa and the Allied forces and supply dumps ashore. Unfortunately, some of the eager-to-die Japanese wanted to attack the first American ships they saw: the pickets. Dennis L. Francis LSM Commander, Flotilla Nine for the period 2‚Äì20 April, Action Report indicated that . . .\\"these ships are not particularly suited for picket duty. Since their primary function is to deliver rockets during invasion operations, it seems feasible that subjecting them to continual enemy air attack will allow this secondary duty to seriously affect their ability to perform their primary function due to damage. They have no great value in combating enemy air craft due to the absence of air search radar, adequate director control for the 5\\"/38 main battery, and director control for the 40mm single guns. The fact that they carry a considerable quantity of explosive rockets in their magazines presents another hazard. In general, it is believed that assigning them to picket duty should be avoided since it means risking the operation of a limited number of specialized ships which could be performed by any number of other landing craft whose primary function is more closely coincident with screening operations.\\" Before these recommendations were implemented the LSM(R)-195 was sunk on 3 May 1945 with 9 killed and 16 wounded, LSM(R)-190 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 18 wounded, the LSM(R)-194 was sunk on 4 May 1945 with 13 killed and 23 wounded. The victory at Okinawa cost 17 crewman of LSM(R)-188 part of the 4,907 killed or missing and 4,824 wounded.

On the way, they help a small village in its fight against bandits.

Yamatoya is best known for his own noir crime-thriller-cum pink film Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands (1967). The plot of Naked Seven is an obvious take-off on Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), which it satirizes. American arthouse audiences could appreciate the parody of Kurosawa, but to Japanese audiences the film also served as a reference to director Yasuharu Hasebe's own popular Alleycat Rock series (1970‚Äì71) from the pre-Roman Porno era. This series featured actress Meiko Kaji in stories about a female motorcycle gang.Weisser, pp. 40-41, 284-285. Having been a director at Nikkatsu since before the Roman Porno days, Hasebe was uncomfortable with the pink film genre, and mixed his first two Roman Pornos with other genres to create interest. Besides the historical-adventure style of Naked Seven, he departed from standard pink style with his next film, Sukeban Deka: Dirty Mary (1974), a tribute to the Dirty Harry films.Weisser, p. 422. Naked Seven was successful at the time of its release, and, in their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films (1998), the Weissers give the film three points out of four.Weisser, pp. 284-285. Because Naked Seven and Dirty Mary, Hasebe's first two films in the Roman Porno series, had both departed from standard pink themes, Hasebe did not consider them to be Pink Films.Hasebe, Yasuharu. (1998). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser in Tokyo, 1999, in Asian Cult Cinema, #25, 4th Quarter, 1999, p.39. After departing Nikkatsu for television, he returned to the studio to direct controversial rape-themed films in the \\"Violent Pink\\" genre. Hasebe considered the first of these films, Rape! (1976), to be his first true sex film. Through the \\"violent pink\\" genre, Hasebe had the creative freedom from the strict sex formula, and created such controversial films as Assault! Jack the Ripper (1976) and Rape! 13th Hour (1977). Though Hasebe's films in this genre are generally considered his best work, they remain controversial.Weisser, pp. 327-328. Naked Seven was a showcase for Nikkatsu's top starlets of the time. Mari Tanaka, as leader of the gang, had made news headlines through her association with the controversial and persecuted Love Hunter (1972) and its sequel, and was an idol of the anti-establishment. Gensh≈´ Hanayagi was a classical ballerina who came to Nikkatsu's attention through appearance in a television commercial. Her major role in director Noboru Tanaka's later Nikkatsu Roman Porno Secret Chronicles: She-Beast Market (1974) created news in Japan. Availability Naked Seven was released theatrically in Japan on December 27, 1972, and played in U.S. arthouse theaters in the 1970s. It was released on DVD in Japan on December 21, 2007, as part of Geneon's tenth wave of Nikkatsu Roman porno series.

Collectively, a group of slides may be known as a slide deck. A slide show is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. Before the advent of the personal computer, a presentation slide could be a 35 mm slide viewed with a slide projector or a transparency viewed with an overhead projector. In the digital age, a slide most commonly refers to a single page developed using a presentation program such as Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, Apache OpenOffice or LibreOffice. It is also possible to create them with a document markup language, for instance with the LaTeX class Beamer. Lecture notes in slide format are referred to as lecture slides, frequently downloadable by students in .ppt or .pdf format.  Slide producing software  Presentation slides can be created in many pieces of software such as Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, LibreOffice Impress, Prezi, ClearSlide, Powtoon, GoAnimate, Snagit, Camtasia, CamStudio, SlideShare, and Reallusion. Some software, like competitors PowToon and GoAnimate, produces slides with more animation. Others like CamStudio can be used to record the screen activity. The most popular pieces of slide producing software are Microsoft PowerPoint, Prezi, Apple Keynote, Google Slides and ClearSlide. * PowerPoint is currently the most popular slides presentation program. LibreOffice Impress is a FOSS alternative. * Prezi was developed in 2009 by Peter Arvai, Peter Hal√°csy and √Åd√°m Somlai-Fischer in Budapest and San Francisco. Today, Prezi has 40 million users internationally. * Apple Keynote, updated for OS X El Capitan, works on Macs and some other Apple devices. * ClearSlide is commonly used in marketing and sales organizations for presentations to customers. * Google Slides was developed by Google at the same time as Google Docs and Sheets, in 2007. The tool allows live collaboration.  Templates  Typically in a set of slides (a \\"deck\\"), all the slides will have a similar layout template, controlling such factors as margins and headings.  Slide sharing websites  Some websites offer facilities to share slide presentations online.  Selection of slide sharing websites  SlideShare allows the user to share presentations publicly or privately. Slides can be uploaded in various ways, via email and through social media are the most common ways of sharing the slides. AuthorSTREAM only allows the user to upload PowerPoint presentation slides.

He conducted the popular \\"Gleanings for ATMs\\" (Amateur Telescope Makers) column in Sky and Telescope magazine for 21 years. Career Cox worked briefly at Perkin Elmer in 1939. Shortly thereafter he was inducted into the Army Air Corps and served for two years in the South Pacific as a weather specialist. After the war, Cox accepted part-time positions as photographic technician at Harvard Observatory and as staff member at Sky and Telescope. He also became associate editor of Weatherwise magazine. In 1949, Cox became science curator at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center in Connecticut, operating its Spitz planetarium projector and developing science activities for the public. In 1953 he began work at Boston University's Optical Research Laboratories, making the prototype optics for military aerial cameras designed by James G. Baker. In 1957, Cox returned to making commercial optics at the A. D. Jones Optical Works. In 1960, Cox joined the McDonnell Aircraft Co. (now McDonnell-Douglas) in St. Louis, Missouri. His optical shop produced prototypes in connection with flight testing of Voodoo and Phantom fighter planes, as well as for the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft. Optics from his shop flew on all American manned space missions up through Gemini 8. Cox retired from McDonnell-Douglas in 1982 with the rank of senior engineer. Amateur telescope making Cox built his first telescope, a 6-inch reflector, at age 16 and four years later had completed a 10-inch reflector as well. With Lou Lojas, Ed Hanna and Carl Groswendt, he founded the Amateur Telescope Makers of New York which became the Optical Division of the New York Amateur Astronomers Association in 1937. The Optical Division conducted evening telescope making classes in the basement of New York's Hayden Planetarium. Cox became a member of the office staff; while there, he started reading proof for planetarium director Clyde Fisher's new astronomy magazine The Sky beginning with its November 1937 issue. During the solar eclipse of April 7, 1940, which was partial in New York City, Cox assisted in the first public use of television to cover an astronomical event. When Earle Brown stepped down as conductor of Sky and Telescope's \\"Gleanings for ATMs\\" column in 1956, Cox took over the department, which he ran until December 1977, for a total of 254 installments. The columns contained practical telescope making ideas, shop techniques, and wisdom drawn from his professional career as an optical engineer. Some of the early columns were later collected into a book, Gleanings Bulletin C. Through the early Stellafane meetings, Cox came to know Russell W. Porter and Albert G. Ingalls. Cox has been described as their \\"undisputed heir\\". Like Ingalls, Cox consistently advocated the highest standards for amateur telescope makers. In a 1956 review of the 12th printing of Ingalls' Amateur Telescope Making, Cox wrote: > It is generally conceded that anyone who mounts a mirror or lens as a > telescope for viewing celestial objects has become a telescope \\"nut\\" > regardless of how the optics were obtained. There is only one important > requirement - that the optics be of first quality, capable of giving > satisfactory views of the moon, the sun, double stars, cluster, nebulae, and > the planets. Cox maintained a voluminous correspondence with both amateurs and professionals throughout his life. He was a frequent and sought-after speaker at meetings of amateur astronomers. Death Cox died of emphysema, contracted apparently from frequent on-the-job exposure to extremely fine glass particles produced by high-speed shaping machines with diamond- impregnated cutting tools.
