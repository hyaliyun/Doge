It serves as the capital of the Kef Governorate. El Kef is situated to the west of Tunis and some east of the border between Algeria and Tunisia. It has a population of (2004 census). The old town is built on the cliff face of the table-top Jebel Dyr mountain. El Kef was the provisional capital of Tunisia during World War II. It was the command centre of the Front de Lib√©ration Nationale during the Algerian War of Independence against the French in the 1950s. The Sidi Bou Makhlouf Mausoleum entombs the patron saint of the city.

Kasbah of Le Kef (17th and 18th century). Kasbah of Le Kef and surroundings. = Etymology = First known by the name of Sicca during the Carthaginian era, then later Sicca Veneria during the rise of Roman domination, the city has carried numerous names throughout its history: Colonia Julia Cirta, Cirta Nova, Sikka Beneria, Shaqbanariya and finally El Kef since the 16th century. =Ancient times= El Kef has since ancient times been the principal city of the High-Tell Mountains and of the Tunisian northwest of which it constituted, until recently, the political center, the most important religious center, and the dominant stronghold. In the early 5th century Apiarius of Sicca was a priest here, and instigated a dispute between the churches of Carthage and Rome concerning the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Africa when he appealed to the church of Rome against his excommunication by the church of Carthage. Around 439, invading Vandals conquered the African Romans near the coast. Eventually, El Kef became part of a Berber Kingdom. =Umayyad conquest= In 688 AD, the city was raided during the Umayyad conquest of North Africa. In the 17th century, a Kasbah of Le Kef was built to house a permanent garrison (ujaq); the construction was completed by the addition of fortified ramparts in 1740. This did not however prevent the taking and pillaging of the city by the Algerians in 1756, nor the occupation by the French military from 1881, following the partial collapse of the Ottoman Empire. On July 8, 1884, the authorities of the new French Protectorate declared El Kef a municipality, one of the first in the country.Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb, Johannes Hendrik Kramers, Bernard Lewis, Charles Pellat et Joseph Schacht, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, vol. IV, √©d. Brill, Leyde, 1954, p. 403 =Contemporary= In 1973, there was a summit meeting here between the Tunisian president Habib Bourguiba and the Algerian president Houari Boum√©di√®ne. The latter proposed a constitution for a Tunisian-Algerian union which Bourguiba declined in favor of the development of economic cooperation between the two countries.  Climate The climate is usually unstable, ranging from summer heat waves to winter snow blizzards.  Main sights  Domes of the Sidi Bou Makhlouf Mausoleum. El Kef contains a certain number of Islamic religious edifices, in its role as the center of a Sufic movement. The Sidi Bou Makhlouf Mausoleum holds the tomb of the founder of the Aissawa brotherhood in Tunisia, Sidi Bou Makhlouf. The El Qadriya mosque is also important to Sufism. A legacy of the old local Jewish community, the synagogue of the Ghriba is the object of veneration by Jews of the region, who come in pilgrimage each year during the week marked by the festival of Sukkot. In the city is the mausoleum of Ali Tukie, the father of Al-Husayn I ibn Ali at-Turki, founder of the Husainid dynasty which ruled Tunisia from 1705 to 1957. The vestiges, well preserved, of a three-naved Roman basilica dating from the beginning of the 5th century named Dar El Kous, dedicated to Saint Peter, have been discovered.Fran√ßois Baratte, F√©thi B√©jaoui et Ze√Øneb Ben Abdallah, Recherches arch√©ologiques √† Ha√Ødra : miscellanea, 2, √©d. √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, Rome, 1999, p. 73Charles Diehl, L'Afrique byzantine : histoire de la domination byzantine en Afrique. 533-709, √©d.

The latter takes its name from the singer Saliha who hails from the region. = Performing arts = It is the seat of the National Center for the Dramatic and Scenic Arts of El Kef. The city also organizes the festival of \\"24 hours of non-stop theatre\\". = Cuisine = The cuisine of El Kef has two recipes specific to the region. First, a typical regional bread, mjamaa or khobz el aid, is prepared at festival times, covered with an egg and decorated with pastry. Second, borzgane is a type of couscous lightly sweetened by alternating layers of dry fruits, dates, and lamb meat. The Festival of Mayou, also known as the Festival of Borzgane, brings the traditional Keffish couscous up to contemporary taste.  Government  The city council is composed of 22 members, including a president, vice president, borough chief, six assistants and thirteen counselors.  Education  Schools, institutes, and faculties include the El Kef Higher Institute of Applied Studies in the Humanities, El Kef Higher Institute of Music and Theatre, El Kef Higher Institute of Information Technology, El Kef Higher Institute of Physical Education, El Kef Graduate School of Agriculture, and El Kef Higher Institute of Nursing Science.  Media  Radio Le Kef, the regional radio service founded November 7, 1991, covers the northwest of the country.  Transportation  The transportation company of El Kef is the only company offering a public transit service by bus. The city is linked with surrounding cities by a network of taxis called louage, and with the capital, Tunis, by a regional railway line passing through Dahmani.  Sports  In sports, the Olympique du Kef, city soccer club founded in 1922 won the 2009-2010 League II Championship. The El Kef Higher Institute of Sport and Physical Education runs the annual Tunisian Women's Soccer Championship.

One of the major applications of UV filters is their use as sunscreens to protect skin from sunburn and other sun/UV related damage. After the invention of digital cameras changed the field of photography, UV filters have been used to coat glass discs fitted to camera lenses to protect hardware that is sensitive to UV light. Background Earlier types of photographic film were quite sensitive to UV light, which used to cause haziness or fogginess, and a bluish hue in color film. UV filters were used to filter out shorter ultraviolet wavelengths while remaining transparent to visible light. However, the modern- day photographic film and digital cameras are less sensitive to UV wavelengths. UV filters are sometimes referred to as L37 or L39 filters, depending on the wavelengths of light they filter out. For example, an L37 filter removes ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 370 nanometers (nm), whereas an L39 filter eliminates light with wavelengths shorter than 390 nm. Applications in printing and photography UV filters span the color spectrum and are used for a wide variety of applications. So-called Ortho Red and Deep Ortho Red lights are commonly used in diffusion transfer, in typesetting film or paper, and other applications dealing with orthochromatic materials. Yellow Gold, Yellow, Lithostar Yellow, and Fuji Yellow filters or safelights provide safe workspaces for contact proofing applications like screen printing and plate making. Pan Green, Infrared Green, and Dark Green filters or safelights are commonly used in scanning applications, work with panchromatic film, papers, and x-rays. Many photographers and cinematographers still use UV filters to protect their lenses' glass and coating. However, UV filters, as with any optical filter, may introduce lens flare and harm contrast and sharpness. Hoods can counteract this, as they offer some protection against impact and shade optical elements, thus preventing lens flare. Also, quality UV filters offer some protection against lens contamination while minimizing the inherent additional distortion. In photography, the term \\"UV filter\\" can also be misused as a filter that passes UV light while blocking other wavelengths in the light spectrum, in the same way, the term \\"IR filter\\" is used for filtering the entire spectrum. The correct name for such filters are \\"UV pass filter\\" and \\"IR pass filter\\" respectively, and they are only used in very specialized photography. Applications in personal care products Since excessive UV radiation can cause sunburn, photoaging, and skin cancer, care products such as sunscreen usually include a classification for the specific wavelengths they filter. UV classifications include UVA (320-400 nm), UVB (290-320 nm) and UVC (200-280 nm). UV-absorbing compounds are used not only in sunscreen, but also in other personal care products, such as lipstick, shampoo, hair spray, body wash, toilet soap, and insect repellent. Chemical filters protect against UV radiation by absorbing, reflecting, or scattering it. Reflection and scattering are accomplished by inorganic physical UV filters, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO). Absorption, mainly of UVB, is done by organic UV filters, which are known as chemical UV filters. The levels of UV filters in sunscreens typically vary from 0.5% to 10%, although they sometimes reach 25%. =Examples of organic UV filters= Many different organic compounds can serve as UV filters. They fall into several structural classes: Environmental aspects The use of UV filters has increased recently due to growing concern about UV radiation and skin cancer, especially as a result of ozone depletion, which in turn has caused concern for its environmental impact. The filter material can enter the environment either directly, through industrial wastewater discharge, or indirectly, through domestic water discharge during showering, bathing, urine excretion or through wastewater treatment. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are not very effective at removing these contaminants. Several UV filters have been detected at ppb or ppt levels in surface water and wastewater, with maximum concentrations in the summertime. Because most UV filters are lipophilic, they tend to bioaccumulate in aquatic environments and food chains originating from them. Confirming bioaccumulation, several studies have shown the presence of UV filters in aquatic organisms. The 4-methyl-benzylidene camphor was detected in the muscle tissue of trout in Swiss and German waters, while traces of Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate and octocrylene were found in shellfish in the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of France. Furthermore, eighteen organic sunscreens were found in sediments of Japanese rivers and lakes, at concentrations ranging from 2 to about 3000 ng/g. The accumulation of organic UV filters in living organisms is of major concern because some of them (and their metabolites) can act as endocrine disruptors both in vitro and in vivo. Also, Goks√∏yr et al. (2009) reported concentrations of organic UV-filters in open waters of the Pacific Ocean, providing evidence of the persistence and wide dispersion of these components in the marine environment. Because UV-filters are not always stable under environmental conditions, it is common for them to transform into other compounds. Water in natural reservoirs, for example, is subjected to sun irradiation, while swimming-pool water is often disinfected by chlorination, bromination, ozonation, or UV irradiation. These byproducts can often be more toxic than the original UV filter. For example, avobenzone transforms in the presence of chlorinated disinfection products and UV radiation, producing substituted chlorinated phenols and acetophenones, which are known for their toxicity. Some organic UV filters under UV radiation can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) (OH, H2O2) (e.g. BP-3, octocrylene (OCR), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), phenyl benzimidazole sulphonic acid (PBS, PABA, etc.). Some studies have recorded increased hydrogen peroxide or H2O2 levels in beaches directly attributable to UV filter transformation. H2O2 is responsible for damaging lipids, proteins and DNA, and generating high-stress levels in marine organisms. Inorganic UV-filters (i.e. TiO2) can also generate ROS, another compound toxic for marine phytoplankton. =Coral bleaching= Dipsastraea pallida (hard coral) with signs of bleaching or crown-of-thorns starfish damage UV filters have shown severe effects on coral reefs due to the bleaching of corals at very low concentrations. As a result, small quantities of sunscreens result in the production of large amounts of coral mucous within 18-48 hrs and bleaching of hard corals within 96 hrs. Among the UV filters that result in coral bleaching according to studies are Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, benzophenone-3, and 4-methyl benzylidene camphor, even in very low concentrations. Bleaching was favored by higher temperatures which act as synergistic factors. Experiments showed that the coral bleaching was not dose-dependent, so it can occur upon exposure to very small amounts. According to the rough estimate of 78 million tourists per year in coral reef areas, the estimated amount of sunscreen used annually in tropical countries ranges between 16,000 and 25,000 tons. 25% of this amount is washed off during bathing activities, leading to a release of 4,000-6,000 tons/year in the reef areas. This results in threatening 10% of the world reefs by sunscreen induced coral bleaching alone. Sunscreens can significantly enhance viral production in seawater. Mechanisms of transformation Photolysis of Benzophenone-3 in presence of Benzotriazole =Photolysis= Photolysis is the main abiotic route for the transformation of UV filters. Photolysis dissociates organic filters into free radicals. Photolysis can be direct or indirect. The direct way occurs when the chromophore of the organic filter absorbs sunlight at certain wavelengths. The indirect pathway occurs in the presence of a photo- sensitizer. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters acts as a photo- sensitizer and produces reactive Photo-oxidation such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen. The photolysis of sunscreen products is more complicated than the behavior of individual UV filters, as shown by this example. In the presence of other UV filters, Benzotriazole, and humic acids, Benzophenone -3 degradation was observed through the loss of hydroxyl and benzoyl functional groups resulting in the formation of 2,4 dimethyl anisole. Photoisomerism =Photoisomerization= Photoisomerization can result in products that absorb less UV light than their parent compound. This is evidenced by cinnamates, salicylates, benzylidine camphor, and dibenzoylmethane derivatives. Octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) can undergo photoisomerization, photodegradation, and photodimerization to obtain several dimers and cyclodimers isomers. Most commercial products are trans isomers but exist in the environment as a mixture of trans and cis isomers upon exposure to UV radiation due to the presence of the C=C double bond adjacent to the aromatic rings. The isomers may have identical physicochemical properties, but they may differ in biological behavior and effects. =Disinfection by- product= Swimming pool water is usually disinfected by chlorination, bromination, ozonation or UV radiation. Upon the presence of some UV filters such as Avobenzone in swimming pools, these can break down and create disinfection by-products, including toxic products, as a result of the interaction between Avobenzone and the active chlorine and UV radiation. Fate of some Organic UV filters =Benzophenones= Metabolic pathway of Benzophenone-3 Benzophenones (BPs) are widely used in UV filters, fragrance enhancers, and plastic additives. The major sources of BP-3 are reported to be human recreational activities and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The anionic forms of both BP-3 and 4-OH-BP3 can undergo direct photodegradation. The photolytic rates of both compounds in natural waters are faster than those in pure water. Radical scavenging experiments revealed that triplet-excited dissolved organic matter (3DOM*) was responsible for the indirect photodegradation of BP-3 and 4-OH-BP3 in seawater, whereas, in freshwater, the indirect photodegradation of these two compounds was attributed to Dissolved Organic Matter and OH radical. =P-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)= Indirect photolysis of p-aminobenzoic acid UV filter in water P-amino benzoic acid was one of the earliest UV filters used in sunscreens (1943). It was used in concentrations up to 5%. It was discovered by 1982 that PABA increases the formation of a particular DNA defect in human cells. The photochemical fate of PABA may be impacted by water constituents, e.g., NO3‚àí, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and HCO3‚àí. PABA undergoes both direct and indirect photolysis in the solution with the presence of NO3. Direct photolysis accounts for 25% of the degradation of PABA and is considered a secondary pathway. On the other hand, indirect photolysis was the dominant pathway. Zhou and Mopper showed that nitrate enhanced the photodegradation of PABA by a factor of 2. However, in the presence of free radical scavengers such as carbonate forms and natural organic matter (NOM), the photodegradation of PABA decreased. It was proposed that the indirect photolysis of PABA was mainly due to the NO3 photolysis product ‚Ä¢OH. The Bicarbonate anion is abundant in water. Bicarbonate caused 10% of ‚Ä¢OH scavenging. The reaction between bicarbonate and the ‚Ä¢OH yields carbonate radical (‚Ä¢CO3), which is less reactive than ‚Ä¢OH. In natural waters, ‚Ä¢CO3 can reach a higher steady-state concentration than ‚Ä¢OH because of its lower reactivity. The enhancement of PABA photolysis by bicarbonate is due to carbonate radicals. Water-soluble NOM is composed of organic acids. These organic acids are mainly humic substances, which can be categorized into a fulvic and humic acid fraction. NOM favors the indirect photolysis of PABA by absorbing the sunlight and weakening its intensity. Two reactions can take place during the degradation of PABA in the presence of nitrate in water as shown in the figure. Three of the four products contain phenolic groups and may thus be estrogenic. So the hazardous byproducts generated during the PABA photoreaction should be concerned for its estrogenicity. =4-tert-butyl-4‚Äô-methoxydibenzoylmethane (avobenzone)= Avobenzone tautomeric forms 4-tert-Butyl-4‚Äô-methoxydibenzoylmethane, known as avobenzone, belongs to dibenzoylmethanes. It is one of the most common UVA (400-320 nm) filters used in sunscreens formulations. It is sold under the trade names Parsol 1789 or Eusolex 9020. Avobenzone exists in two tautomeric forms: enol and keto. In sunscreen formulations, avobenzone exists predominantly in the enol form, which has a maximum absorption at wavelengths ranging from 350 to 365 nm depending on the solvent used. The double bond of the enolic form was shown to be more reactive in conditions of aquatic chlorination than the aromatic ring. In a chlorinated aquatic environment, Avobenzone transforms to two corresponding aldehydes and acids, as shown in the figure. Both aldehydes are formed as a result of the CO-CH2 bond. They are less stable in the oxidative conditions and easily transform into the corresponding acids. Chlorinated acetophenone derivatives are also formed due to the cleavage of the same CO-CH2 bond. Chlorinated acetophenone derivatives are tear gases, trigger dermatitis, and some other health problems. It was reported that chlorination of the original avobenzone into the aromatic ring position is less possible. The cleavage of the CO-Ar bond results in the formation of 4-chloroanisole. Avobenzone transformation products in chlorinated aquatic systems =Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC)= Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC) is one of the most common UVB filters used worldwide. It is known as Eusolex 2292 and Uvinul MC80. It is included in the High Production Volume Chemicals (HPVC) list, which includes chemicals produced or imported in the EU at a rate of more than 1000 tons per year. The lifetime of the EHMC was predicted to be from hours to a few days. EHMC is well tolerated by the skin. However, it has some side effects, including its ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and penetrate the human skin after exposure to UV light. EHMC has also been found in shellfish, fish, and cormorants at ng/g levels, which suggests that it can be accumulated in the food chain. EHMC was proved to be responsible for coral bleaching by promoting viral infections. From the toxicological point of view, EHMC has estrogenic properties both in vitro and in vivo. For instance, exposure to this compound caused the increase of the uterus' weight for rats. Prenatal exposure to EHMC can affect both the reproductive and neurological development in the offspring of rats, which can be a cause for concern because humans are routinely exposed to this compound through the use of sunscreens and other cosmetics. The main transformation pathway for EHMC is photolysis. Direct photolysis represents the dominant transformation pathway. On the other hand, the indirect photolysis due to OH is negligible and, due to dissolved organic matter, will be a secondary route. Four transformation products were detected for EHMC upon exposure to UV radiation. 4-methoxy benzaldehyde (MOBA) and 4-methoxy cinnamic acid are two transformation products of EHMC via dealkylation. The intermediate MOBA is more toxic than EHMC towards the bacteria.

In his book, Roper mentions that he was a particularly difficult slave for traders to sell because of his almost-white complexion and reminisced that his fair skin tone could have been the cause of the terribly severe torture he endured from his masters. Because he had only worked as a domestic servant, Roper struggled tremendously when he was put to work in the fields and forests of the South‚Äîreceiving harsher treatment for his inefficiency from his overseers and masters. Roper was passed from one master to another and led throughout the Southern states by slave traders‚Äîchanging hands 17 or more times. Throughout his time in slavery, he attempted escape on at least 16 occasions, most of them while under his cruelest master, Mr. Gooch. The merciless master made certain to punish Roper with increasing ferocity each time he was recaptured, as illustrated in the book: > My master gave me a hearty dinner, the best he ever did give me; but it was > to keep me from dying before he had given me all the flogging he intended. > After dinner he took me to a log-house, stripped me quite naked, fastened a > rail up very high, tied my hands to the rail, fastened my feet together, put > a rail between my feet, and stood on one end of it to hold me down; the two > sons then gave me fifty lashes each, the son-in-law another fifty, and Mr. > Gooch himself fifty more. Roper goes on to say, > This may appear incredible, but the marks which they left at present remain > on my body, a standing testimony to the truth of this statement of his > severity. Other punishments Roper recounts receiving from his various masters (though mostly Mr. Gooch) include lashings and beatings where he was forced to wear 40-plus pound shackles and chains afterwards‚Äîfurther impeding him from performing his set tasks in the fields, having his feet and fingers crushed and fingernails pulled out, being chained to slower-working slaves, and having tar poured onto his head and face and then set on fire. In west Florida in 1834, Roper made his final escape from a particularly unkind master, Mr. Register, and carefully made his way to New York as a fugitive. To ensure that he was not captured along the way, he obtained a passport which claimed he was a freed slave. He accomplished this by telling a false tale of his past to a few sympathetic farmers in Georgia. > I pretended to show her my passport, feeling for it everywhere about my coat > and hat, and not finding it, I went back a little way, pretending to look > for it, but came back, saying, I was very sorry, but I did not know where it > was ... [the farmers offered to help and their] lad sat down and wrote what > I told him, nearly filling a large sheet of paper for the passport, and > another with recommendations. After having little luck searching for employment in and around New York, Roper decided in 1835 to sail to England, where slavery had been abolished two years prior. Freedom Moses became quite famous in England because of his grand escape from American slavery, and the book he later wrote about his life as a slave, in which he included explicit examples of the torture methods used by slave holders. Roper's patronage in England was carefully planned; he carried letters of introduction to Rev. Dr. Fletcher, Rev. Dr. Morison and Rev. Dr. Raffles, through whom he met other sympathetic patrons, notably Rev. Dr. T. Price and Rev. F. Cox, and leading abolitionists such as Thomas Fowell Buxton. Roper acquired an education at schools in Hackney, Wallingford in Oxfordshire, followed by university in London, so he could write his own account as well as any English author. > At Hackney I remained half a year, going through the rudiments of an English > education. At this time I attended the ministry of Dr Cox, which I enjoyed > very much ... never, I trust, will be efaced from my memory, the parental > care of the Rev. Dr Morison, from whom I can say, I received the greatest > kindness. His patrons then assisted him in his object of touring the country's chapels to spread knowledge of American slavery; and subscribed to, and helped promote his autobiography. Roper toured the length and breadth of Britain, as well as several places in Ireland and Scotland, making the case for the abolition of slavery in America. In London, his two most influential speeches were during May 1836. The first at the Rev. Thomas Price's Baptist Chapel, Devonshire Square, and the second at the independent Finsbury Chapel of Rev. Dr Alexander Fletcher. Each attracted large crowds and were extensively reported, being of great influence. In England, Roper also published the first and second version of the narrative of his escape from slavery, A Narrative of the Adventures and Escape of Moses Roper, from American Slavery (Philadelphia: Merrihew & Gunn, 1838). According to Martha J. Cutter, the 1838 edition, which contained five illustrations, is one of the first illustrated slave narratives published by a U.S.-born slave.Cutter, Martha J. \\"Revising Torture: Moses Roper and the Visual Rhetoric of the Slave's Body in the Transatlantic Abolition Movement\\". ESQ: A Journal of the American Renaissance 60.3 (2014) (No. 236 O.S.): 372. Cutter also contends that Roper's narrative \\"depicts forms of agency and subjectivity that move beyond the master's system of representation,\\" layering \\"patterns of Christian symbolism that invoke martyrdom and even crucifixion onto and over a resistant and active enslaved body.\\" The text therefore \\"performs a mode of Christian salvation that involves putting one's fate in the hands of God but one's feet in the position of running (away from, or out of, slavery).\\" The text's illustrations also refigure formations of enslaved abasement common in abolitionist discourse through a type of liberation theology.Cutter, 373. Final years Roper married Ann Stephen Price in Bristol, England, on December 21, 1839. He had four daughters: one born on the Atlantic Ocean on the way to Canada in about 1844, two born in Quebec and the youngest born in Nova Scotia between 1850 and 1857. He thrice returned to the British Isles: first in 1846 to \\"settle private matters\\" (possibly to arrange a new edition of his Narrative); then in 1854 and sometime before 1861, to lecture. The final time, he brought his wife and daughters back, and the 1861 British Census finds them living with his father-in-law (William Price) in Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorgan, Wales, while Moses is in Cambridge, England, staying in a boarding house.\\"A Chronology of Moses Roper's Life\\". Some time after 1861, Moses Roper returned to the United States, where he lived the life of an itinerant lecturer, travelling from place to place discoursing on various subjects, including \\"Africa and the African People\\", \\"Causes of the Colors of the Races\\" and on the \\"Holy Land.\\"\\"Mother Was A Slave; Death of Moses Roper in the City HospitalWas Suffering from Skin Disease and a Kidney Complaint\\", Boston Globe, April 16, 1891, p. 1.

Skillings in Franklin County, Maine, near the town of Strong when \\"his strength gave out\\" in April 1891. Roper, in very poor physical condition with a little more than a hundred dollars in his pocket and accompanied only by a dog named Pete (described as \\"his faithful companion\\") was placed on a train to Boston, Massachusetts.\\"Maine MelangeFranklin\\", Bangor (Me.) Daily Whig and Courier, April 15, 1891, p. 1. Roper and his dog made it to Boston, but he was found unconscious in a railroad station and taken to the Boston City Hospital. When he was found, it was noted that he was \\"well protected from the cold, wearing four shirts, two overcoats and three pair of pantaloons.\\" It was also found that he was suffering from \\"a complication of diseases of the heart and kidneys and also from eczema\\" which caused his death on April 15, 1891.

Research studies The increased performance benefit associated with muscle contractions that take place during SSCs has been the focus of much research in order to determine the true nature of this enhancement. At present, there is some debate as to where and how this performance enhancement takes place. It has been postulated that elastic structures in series with the contractile component can store energy like a spring after being forcibly stretched. Since the length of the tendon increases due to the active stretch phase, if the series elastic component acts as a spring, it would therefore be storing more potential energy. This energy would be released as the tendon shortened. Thus, the recoil of the tendon during the shortening phase of the movement would result in a more efficient movement than one in which no energy had been stored. This research is further supported by Roberts et al. However, other studies have found that removing portions of these series-elastic components (by way of tendon length reduction) had little effect on muscle performance. Studies on turkeys have, nevertheless, shown that during SSC, a performance enhancement associated with elastic energy storage still takes place but it is thought that the aponeurosis could be a major source of energy storage (Roleveld et al., 1994). The contractile component itself has also been associated with the ability to increase contractile performance through muscle potentiation while other studies have found that this ability is quite limited and unable to account for such enhancements (Lensel and Goubel, 1987, Lensel-Corbeil and Goubel, 1990; Ettema and Huijing, 1989). Community agreement The results of these often contradictory studies have been associated with improved efficiencies for human or animal movements such as counter-movement jumps and running (Asmussen and Bonde-Peterson, 1974b; Giovanni Cavagna, 1977; Komi, 1984b). However it is still not established why and how this enhancement takes place. It is one of the underlying mechanisms of plyometric training.

It reinterprets the Godzilla film series from the perspective of the daikaiju‚Äînot a fictional creature depicted on-screen via suitmation, but an irradiated varanid-turned B-movie star named Gojiro (an homage to Gojira, the original native proper name in Japanese for Godzilla). Gojiro, a freak mutation with a cynical worldview, suffers the pain of solitude as well as several maladies experienced by entertainers, including drug abuse and suicidal tendencies. The story revolves around his adventures with human friend Komodo, a scientific genius scarred as a child by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as they attempt to fulfill their \\"Triple Ring Promise\\" to bring about world peace. The odyssey takes them from their home on Radioactive Island‚Äîalso home to several children, called Atoms, suffering from radiation sickness‚Äîto several locations in Hollywood and the Trinity site in New Mexico. The novel is often compared to John Gardner's earlier novel Grendel, a retelling of the Beowulf epic through the eyes of the monster. Plot summary The earliest event is the striking of a comet into the earth 65 million years ago, at the Encrucijada Valley site as the first nuclear test later occurs. A small lizard witnesses and survives this event, and carries on his line. This lizard is revered as the heroic Varanidid by Gojiro's lizard homeland, though they forget what exactly he did. He is also the precursor of the reptilian creator-beast revered by the dying Monongae clan that lived in the same location before the nuclear tests occurred. The remains of the dead dinosaurs form fossil fuels which pool under the valley. Much later, in the 19th century, Joseph Prometheus Brooks is born to a large middle American family, his father a severe and religious man. Joseph's mother recognizes his genius and manages to have him sent away at a very young age to the university of G√∂ttingen in Germany, where he meets his future collaborator in nuclear physics, Victor Stiller. When he returns home on holiday, he finds that his father has burned the entire rest of the family to death, along with their home, believing that existence is an affront to God. Some time later, the last few members of the Monongae clan send supplications of help to the beast who lives inside the Earth to help them, and charge the youngest member, Nelson Monongae with reawakening him. That same night, he encounters Joseph Brooks' future wife Leona, who soon has visions of past and future events, including the striking of the comet, and an incomplete vision of an adult Joseph Brooks holding an object and looking at something. She travels to Germany, where she finds Joseph playing clarinet in and underground jazz club, having become disaffected by the university. They marry and travel to the United States, along with Victor Stiller, when WWII breaks out, Joseph and Victor becoming the premier nuclear scientists of the American war effort. Leona becomes pregnant nine months before the first nuclear test, a couple of years before 1945. Joseph intends the nuclear test to cause such vast destruction that it calls the attention of the creator of the world to Earth. Leona and Joseph's daughter, Sheila Brooks, is born on the day of the test, and Leona dies, having come too close to the blastwave in an attempt to witness God's manifestation. A couple years later, another site for a second test is chosen, the homeland of the lizard Gojiro. He is a young lizard uninitiated into adulthood and the mysteries of lizard philosophy, which involves bodily immersion in a pool of oil (the Black Spot) that bubbles to the surface. Immediately before he feels the compulsion to go to the black spot, he witnesses Victor, Joseph and a general surveying the spot and arguing, as well as the young Sheila in the window of the plane they arrived on. Gojiro is held captive by Joseph's baleful gaze at the same moment he feels the compulsion to go the Black Spot, and goes to it when Joseph breaks the staredown. Gojiro dawdles before the Spot, and just as he makes the resolution to jump, he is hit by the full force of the nuclear explosion test, preventing his immersion into full lizard-hood, and leading into his mutation into a 500 foot tall intelligent lizard, with the ability to breathe radioactive energy beams, incredible regenerative ability, and to involuntarily receive psychic messages and transport his consciousness into other bodies, due to his super-advanced \\"Quadcameral\\" brain, an advancement on the human three layer brain. He somehow floats to Radioactive Island, an unmapped island covered by a permanent dome of thick cloud, to which other lost souls affected by nuclear radiation will eventually float as well, along with entire pieces of land and the cultural/technological \\"flotjet\\" of the modern era. Around the same time as the nuclear tests were occurring, a Japanese scientist in Hiroshima was attempting to invent a radio with which the thoughts of animals could be heard. One year exactly before the nuclear bombing, his son, Yukio Komodo, is born. On Komodo's first birthday, the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima occurs. Two versions of this event are related. In the first version told at the opening of the novel, Komodo has a premonition of the incoming attack, and his parents die in the blast. Wandering through the blasted cityscape, he sends a supplication to Gojiro, who appears before him. In the other, his father has the premonition, and forces Komodo and the radio deep into a hole. The heat of the blast causes the radio to burn three concentric rings into his chest above his heart, which Komodo later takes to be the emblem of his bond with Gojiro. Mostly unharmed by the blast, he is nonetheless stunned into a catatonic state in which he is aware of the outside world but does not move. He becomes a celebrity after the war, meeting many famous people, including Victor Stiller. He is diligently nursed by a black soldier, Walter Crenshaw, who also keeps safe the radio he was found with. When Komodo is 10 years old, he receives a psychic supplication from Gojiro on Radioactive Island, and offers to be his friend. This awakens him from his coma, and Walter helps Komodo to escape on a fishing boat. Walter tries and fails to give the radio to Komodo as he escapes, but he keeps it safe from American authorities, entrusting it to his wife, never revealing it or Komodo's location. Komodo's death is then faked. At around the same time, Joseph Brooks drives around America with his daughter Sheila on the lam, eventually being captured, his death also being faked, and he is taken back to the Encrucijada, where he lives unknown to Sheila, and daily assumes the pose his wife had painted of him. Komodo arrives on Radioactive island, where he quickly becomes friends with Gojiro. Gojiro remembers this time as the highlight of his life, and they pledge to be together forever. Gojiro begins to expound philosophic dialogues, inspired by a muse he names \\"Budd Hazard\\", which act as an extension and elaboration of the philosophy of the lizards, centred around the processes of change, identity and evolution. Gojiro's obsessive interest in this philosophy leads him to force Komodo to alter their promise, to re-centre it around the creation of a new \\"Beam and Bunch\\", Hazard's conceptual analogue of a species/nation. The failure of this new promise is one of the contributing factors to Gojiro's later regret and depression. After this new promise is made, two new people arrive on the island, the child Shig and the teenage Kishi, both Japanese, the first of the \\"atoms\\", people affected by nuclear radiation, to arrive on the island. Komodo falls in love with Kishi, impregnating her and driving a wedge between him and Gojiro. When Komodo and Kishi attempt to leave the island, Gojiro enters a hallucinatory state of mad rage, and inadvertently kills Kishi when his thrashing causes her to fall from the boat and drown, her daughter Ebi being born at that exact instant. This event leads Shig to hate Gojiro, and causes Gojiro to become suicidally hateful of himself, but Komodo forgives his Gojiro. Other atoms begin arriving, and Komodo assumes a fatherly role toward them. Unlike Gojiro and Komodo's hopes of forming a new Beam with the atoms, the atoms are stupid, unruly and destructive, with the except of Shig and Ebi. Various attempts to form a bond between them and Gojiro end in failure, including a series of monster movies starring Gojiro in which the atoms appear as extras. Shig steals these recordings and releases them as feature films, to Gojiro's dismay when he finds them playing on TV. Gojiro's extreme popularity causes his fans to form a cult-like attachment to him, further fed by Shig feeding the outside world a bastardized version of Budd's philosophy. This culminates when Shig steals the design of a crystal radio Komodo has made in his lab (having become a mad scientist in the meantime), and sells them to Gojiro's fans, imploring them to use them to send constant supplications to Gojiro, begging for \\"the 90 series (the capstone of Hazard's philosophy) and the PA (Gojiro's personal appearance before his fans). Through the crystal radios, Gojiro psychically receives every one of these supplications from across the world, and his mind is transported into their bodies, often experiencing great physical and psychic pain, as many of his fans are destitute and desperate. Komodo builds a radio tower to receive the supplications instead of Gojiro, the supplications killing the ground around the tower. Gojiro wanders near the tower and accidentally touches it, receiving the supplication of Billy Snickman, a feral American child who ardently watches Gojiro's movies from outside drive-in theatres. Billy merely asks Gojiro who he is, to which he inexplicably responds \\"Bridger of Gaps, Linker of Lines, Nexus of Beam and Bunch, Defender of the Evoloo\\". After this, Gojiro begs Komodo to sever whatever neural link in his brain allows the supplications to enter, which Komodo reluctantly does. They discover the Quadcameral brain does not possess Gojiro's regenerative powers, and the removal of the link is permanent. The vulnerability of his brain forms the basis of Gojiro's future suicide attempts. His final attempt, which he nearly succeeds at, causes Komodo to threaten double suicide if Gojiro succeeds, stopping Gojiro. He and Komodo agree to a final amendment to the Triple Ring Promise: if they fail to fulfill the promise in one year, Gojiro must be allowed to kill himself and Komodo to respect that and continue living. Around the same timespan, Sheila is tormented by visions centring around her father on the Encrucijada. Due to her extreme psychotherapy, she is not directly aware of this, and instead her visions are transmuted into apocalyptic nightmares that her husband Billy Zeber has turned into award- winning movies, making Sheila rich and famous. He is unable to alleviate her psychic pain however, and at a crisis point sends a letter of supplication to Radioactive Island, begging Gojiro to come to America and make a movie, Gojira and Joseph Brooks in the Valley of Decision, addressing Gojiro by the titles he responded to Billy's question. Gojiro and Komodo secretly make their way to America, Komodo shrinking Gojiro to the size of a normal lizard using a technology variously described as a shrinking pill, ray, injection or potion. Komodo meets Sheila and immediately feels a deep connection to her, but she refuses to acknowledge the plea she sent. Komodo finds that Shig got wind of their departure and managed to transport the atoms and the hyper-fertile biome of Radioactive Island to a peculiar mansion in California. Shig acts as Komodo and Gojiro's combined chauffeur, bodyguard, lawyer and spokesman, directing their activities from behind the scenes. Komodo meets figures in Hollywood, including the aged Victor Stiller. He also tries to meet Walter Crenshaw, but finds that he is dead, and his family suspect him of being an agent of the American government. Komodo convinces Gojiro to travel to the Encrucijada valley, hoping to find the source of Sheila's visions. Along the way, Gojiro encounters Billy and shies away from him, consumed by self-loathing. Komodo and Gojiro make it to the Valley, where Shig houses them in a vast underground chamber bored out by nuclear test explosions. On TV screens they see the image of Joseph Brooks that his wife had painted, but on live-feed TV screens. Komodo attempts to communicate with him but fails, and returns to Sheila to tell her her father is still alive. Gojiro remains behind, where he inexplicably begins to have a series of visions reminiscent of the 90 series supplications, where he experiences past events from the perspective of the Varanidid, and his own birth. He investigates the shack Joseph lives in, and finds a stack of paintings depicting the visions he just received, as well as the blackboard containing the equation Joseph solved to create the atomic bomb, and receives a vision of Nelson and Leona's meeting. During his spying, Victor and the general visit Joseph, attempting to communicate him, and both are briefly subject to the vision that keeps Joseph glued to the Encrucijada. Joseph says that the nuclear bomb was a failure, as it was unable to call God's attention. At the same time, Komodo experiences a whirlwind of events as he attempts to take Sheila to the Encrucijada, but is waylaid by Victors government goons. Shig saves Komodo and Sheila by luring the paparazzi to them, then Komodo returns to the mansion to bury Ebi, who died soon after telling Sheila she wished that Sheila were her mother. Komodo then has a clandestine meeting with Billy Zeber, Sheila's husband, who charges Komodo with protecting her, disappearing into the night. Komodo is again captured by Victor, but is saved again by Shig and the atoms, as well as Walter Crenshaw's son. Gojiro, still spying on Victor, has a vision of Victor's childhood, and witnesses Victor pick up the small comic book explaining Gojiro's true origin that Komodo had attempted to give to Victor, which inspires him to make a new equation on the blackboard. Gojiro returns to the cave and scrawls it on the wall, then sees on TV that the mansion has been ransacked. Komodo arrives and attempts to complete Joseph's work, arriving at a method to compress and disperse into nothingness anything at all, which Joseph hopes will be enough to draw God' attention, and Komodo and Gojiro fear will cause an \\"All- Inclusive Crisis of the Evoloo\\", a moment of such great chaos and change that the universe will be unable to surmount it and continue. Shig delivers the box Walter had been keeping secret, containing the Komodo's father's radio. Komodo and Gojiro simultaneously experience Komodo's lost childhood memories, as well as his and Gojiro's moments of birth. Komodo completes Victor's work, demonstrating it by annihilating some of his beloved pet birds. Gojiro is enraged at Komodo, and cannot understand Komodo's optimism at the situation. Sheila arrives and Komodo goes out to her. Gojiro takes a golden arsenic pill, but is sucked inside of it in accordance with Komodo's completed equation, where his consciousness disperses. Komodo and Leona meet the now centenarian Nelson Monongae, dressed as the Varanidid, who gives them a small capsule of oil. Komodo and Sheila return to the cave, where Komodo realises Gojiro has been sucked into the pill, and using devices capable of reading Gojiro's Quadcameral brainwaves, determines that whatever Beamic force had sent Gojiro's consciousness into the past was now sustaining only the single neural connection that once received the 90 series supplications, barely keeping him alive. They see Victor Stiller on TV tapping the oil under the Encrucijada, which they discern is the lifeblood of the Beam keeping Gojiro alive. The atoms blow up the derrick, and Sheila and Komodo immerse the pill in the capsule of oil, completing Gojiro's thwarted initiation into full lizardhood. Komodo links Sheila, himself (realising he is also Quadcameral) and the pill, so that Sheila's supplication can recall him from nothingness. Gojiro's dispersed consciousness experiences Sheila's birth (and witnesses Leona's death), and Sheila and Komodo's psychic union, then hears her supplication. He finds the will to live and reassembles his body, reappearing before Victor, who has an orb which is the completion of his plan to destroy all of creation. Victor tosses the orb, which Gojiro catches in his third eye, the window to the Quadcameral. The entire earth is sucked inside of Gojiro's brain, leaving him alone in space. He exhorts the world to reform itself, which it does, nobody on earth being aware of what has happened. Gojiro, Sheila and Komodo return to Radioactive Island, where Gojiro asks Komodo permission to die despite the fulfilment of the Triple Ring Promise, thinking that he is dying as he loses his regenerative powers. As they prepare Gojiro's funeral raft, they see Gojiro's long-lost homeland arrive on Radioactive Island, and rather than dying, he instead becomes the fully initiated adult lizard he failed to become as a child. Fourteen years later, Komodo leave a letter at Gojiro's homeland, telling him of his and Sheila's happy life together, and reminiscing about the time he and Gojiro spent together.

It states that in a cluster of two or more obstruents (stops or the sibilant ), any one of which is a voiced aspirated stop anywhere in the sequence, the whole cluster becomes voiced and aspirated. Thus to the PIE root \\"learn, become aware of\\" the participle \\"enlightened\\" loses the aspiration of the first stop (Grassmann's law) and with the application of Bartholomae's law and regular vowel changes gives Sanskrit buddha \\"enlightened\\". Further developments In both the Indic and the Iranian subgroups, further developments partially obscured the operation of the law: Thanks to the falling together of plain voiced and voiced aspirated stops in Iranian, Bartholomae's law appears synchronically as progressive voicing assimilation after roots that originally ended in voiced aspirates, for example Old Avestan aogda \\"he said\\" from PIE . This is not true for roots with plain voiced stops, for example Old Avestan yuxta \\"yoked\\" from , where Bartholomae's law does not apply. In Indic, voiced *z as resulting from Bartholomae's law was devoiced to s, although there is some evidence from the Rigvedic language that a voiced aspirate *z once existed in Indic as well: This is shown by forms like gdha \\"he swallowed\\" and duduk·π£a- \\"want to give milk\\" (see below). Interpretation A written form such as -ddh- (a literal rendition of the devanƒÅgarƒ´ representation) presents problems of interpretation. The choice is between a long voiced stop with a specific release feature, aspiration, symbolized in transliteration by -h-, or else a long stop (or stop cluster) with a different phonational state, \\"murmur\\", whereby the breathy release is an artifact of the phonational state. The latter interpretation is rather favored by such phenomena as the Rigvedic form gdha \\"he swallowed,\\" which is morphologically a middle aorist (more exactly \\"injunctive\\") to the root ghas- \\"swallow\\", as follows: ghs-t-a > *gzdha, whence gdha by the regular loss of a sibilant between stops in Indic. While the idea of voicing affecting the whole cluster with the release feature conventionally called aspiration penetrating all the way to the end of the sequence is not entirely unthinkable, the alternative ‚Äì the spread of a phonational state (but murmur rather than voice) through the whole sequence ‚Äì involves one less step and therefore via Occam's razor counts as the better interpretation. Bartholomae's law intersects with another Indic development, namely what looks like the deaspiration of aspirated stops in clusters with s: descriptively, Proto-Indo-European \\"you lick\\" becomes *leyksi, whence Sanskrit lek·π£i. However, Grassmann's law, whereby an aspirated stop becomes non-aspirated before another aspirated stop (as in the example of buddha, above), suggests something else. In late Vedic and later forms of Sanskrit, all forms behave as though aspiration was simply lost in clusters with s, so such forms to the root dugh- \\"give milk\\" (etymologically *-) show the expected devoicing and deaspiration in, say, the desiderative formation du-dhuk·π£-ati (with the root-initial dh- intact, that is, undissimilated). But the earliest passages of the Rigveda show something different: desiderative duduk·π£ati, aorist duk·π£ata (for later dhuk·π£ata) and so on. Thus it is apparent that what went into Grassmann's law were forms like *dhugzhata, dhudhugzha- and so on, with aspiration in the sibilant clusters intact. The deaspiration and devoicing of the sibilant clusters were later and entirely separate phenomena (and connected with yet another suite of specifically Indic sound laws, namely a \\"rule conspiracy\\" to eliminate all voiced ‚Äì and murmured ‚Äì sibilants). Indeed, even the example \\"swallowed\\" given above contradicts the usual interpretation of devoicing and deaspiration: by such a sequence, *ghs-to gave, first, *ksto (if the process was already Indo- European) or *ksta (if Indo-Iranian in date), whence Sanskrit *kta, not gdha. Relative chronology There is no evidence that Bartholomae's law predated Indo-Iranian, that is, that it was a feature of Proto-Indo-European. The Latin form lectus \\"couch\\" and Ancient Greek l√©ktron \\"bed\\" are differently formed but both continue the root \\"lie\\" (the English word being from the same root). But because the Latin would otherwise have resulted in a forbidden cluster (gt), it may well just be a case of voicing assimilation. In similar combinations arising within Greek, the pattern is for the whole cluster to become aspirated, thus l√©khthron. It obviously does not in this formation, which for other reasons as well is likely to be very old. This may be because the consonant cluster is more complex. In the case of Latin lectus, it is significant that the root does not otherwise survive in Latin at all, so that there can be no history of analogical remodeling or other disturbances. It is not completely clear what the result of a sequence would have been in Latin, but other evidence suggests lengthening of the vowel plus simplification, so lƒìgus (cf. co-ƒÅgulum \\"rennet\\" < , tƒìgula \\"roofing tile\\" < ).

They are winged or wingless ectoparasites of bats, and often have long legs. They appear to be host-specific, with different species of bat flies occurring only on particular species of bat hosts, sometimes with multiple species of flies sharing a host bat. Systematics The 237 or so species are divided among roughly 33 genera and five subfamilies. The monophyly of this family has not been supported. The streblid subfamily Trichobiinae may be more closely related to the Nycteriboscinae and other lineages in the Nycteribiidae. Several authors favor splitting the family into an Old World lineage consisting of the Ascodipterinae and Nycteriboscinae and a New World lineage containing all other subfamilies. The former would be named Ascodipterinae and the latter would retain the name Streblidae. Alternatively, the Streblidae and Nycteribiidae might be united as a monophyletic family containing all bat flies. Subfamilies are here listed in presumed order of most ancient to most recently evolved. Selected genera are also given, sorted alphabetically, as too little is known about their interrelationships.

A Casco-class, light-draft monitor, she was intended for service in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy. These warships sacrificed armor plate for a shallow draft and were fitted with a ballast compartment designed to lower them in the water during battle. Though the original designs for the Casco-class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban B. Simers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York, NY, Ericsson and Simers had a poor relationship and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair John Lenthall had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Simers had failed to compensate for the armor his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only 3 inches. Simers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by 22 inches to make them seaworthy. The entire class was considered a disappointment, and Etlah was laid up at one or another location until sold 12 September 1874.

The first was founded by Prince Francis Xavier Drucki-Lubecki in 1828 in the Kingdom of Congress Poland and functioned until 1885, when it was absorbed by the State Bank of the Russian Empire. The second was founded in 1924 in the Second Polish Republic by Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski and was liquidated in 1952.

History  Prince Francis Xavier Drucki-Lubecki, founder of Poland's first bank The first Bank of Poland was founded in Warsaw in 1828 by Prince Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki. An institution of the government of the Kingdom of Poland, it was entitled with issuance of the Polish currency as well as control over the credit rates. It was also entitled with a concession to operate foreign currencies and buy off credits issued by foreign companies and banks. Throughout its existence, the Bank of Poland was allowed to issue banknotes and coins up to the amount of its stock (initially 30,000,000 z≈Çotych, 42 million in 1834 and 53 million in 1841). As a legal entity, the bank also financed a number of important enterprises in Russian-held Poland. Between 1829 and 1837 it spent a large part of its income on road construction, until 1842 it was also the main sponsor of the coal mining development in the region of Zag≈Çƒôbie and the Old Polish Industrial Area around Skar≈ºysko-Kamienna. Seriously crippled by administrative measures after the November Uprising, after the January Uprising it was made subordinate directly to the Russian Imperial Ministry of Treasury. During the period of liquidation of Polish institutions following the failed uprising, in 1870 it was deprived of the rights of a currency issuing organ and banned from giving long-term credits. 5-z≈Çoty coin issued during the November 1830 Uprising. On January 1, 1886 it was officially closed down and by 1894 its assets were swallowed by the State Bank of Russia.

Its stock was soon raised from the initial 100,000,000 z≈Çotych to 150 million, split onto 1.5 million shares. The bank was independent of the government of Poland, though it carried out its monetary policies. As the main shareholder, the President of Poland had the right to name the chairman and deputy chairman of the bank's board of trustees.

(Abstract; full article requires fee or subscription) He held another comics convention at that hotel the following year, (Abstract; full article requires fee or subscription) launching the New York Comic Art Convention series. On March 11, 1973, Seuling was arrested at the Second Sunday monthly comic book show for allegedly \\"selling indecent material to a minor\\". Seuling wrote a guest editorial in Warren Publishing's black-and-white horror-comics magazine Vampirella #25 detailing his experience and denying the claim he had sold an underground comic book to someone under 18. = Other activities = Seuling performed as a voice actor in Ralph Bakshi's 1972 Fritz the Cat movie, doing voices for two characters. In 1974, at the Brooklyn Museum's Community Gallery, he staged the exhibit \\"Brooklyn's Comic Book Artists\\", featuring artwork by 13 comics artists who were born or lived in Brooklyn. Identified by neighborhood on the poster for the show, these included Neal Adams, then living in the Coney Island neighborhood; Will Eisner; Carmine Infantino, of Greenpoint; Joe Kubert; Harvey Kurtzman, who lived along Eastern Parkway; and Gray Morrow, formerly of East Flatbush. = Sea Gate Distributors = In 1972, Seuling founded Sea Gate Distributors, named after the Brooklyn community Sea Gate, where he lived as an adult. Seuling cut deals with Archie, DC, Marvel, and Warren to ship their comic books from a new distribution center in Sparta, Illinois, thereby developing the concept of the direct market distribution system for getting comics directly into comic book specialty shops, bypassing the then established newspaper/magazine distributor method. The move from newsstand distribution to the direct market (nonreturnable, heavily discounted, direct purchasing of comics from publishers) went hand-in-hand with the growth of specialty comics shops that catered to collectors who could then buy back issues months after a newsstand issue had disappeared. Comics historian Mark Evanier, noting the significance, wrote that Seuling ran Sea Gate with his then-girlfriend Jonni Levas.Rozanski, \\"Evolution, Part IV\\", Comics Buyer's Guide #98 via MileHighComics.com. \\"Joni Levas, Phil's girlfriend of the time and partner in Seagate [sic] Distributing.\\" . A key element of Sea Gate's new distribution system was a prepay requirement for customers, which, given the low margins of comics retailing at the time (and the fact that many books shipped late), was onerous for many of the stores. By the late 1970s, however, thanks to Seuling's changes to distribution ‚Äî and the merchandizing success of such comic-book-styled films as Star Wars and Superman ‚Äî comics were selling well: in the six years between 1974 and 1980, U.S. \\"comic or fantasy-related specialty shops\\" rose from 200 or 300 to around 1500. In late 1977 or early 1978, Sea Gate set up regional sub-distributors who were buying product at a 50% discount. This reduced Seuling's paperwork and enabled the sub-distributors to sell smaller orders than Sea Gate's minimum of five copies of each comic book title. Seuling maintained a virtual monopoly on comics distribution, until a lawsuit brought by New Media/Irjax in 1978.\\"Direct Distribution\\" in Duin, Steve and Richardson, Mike (ed.s). Comics Between the Panels (Dark Horse Publishing, 1998), pp. 126-130. Irjax sued DC, Marvel, Archie, and Warren for their anti-competitive arrangement with Seagate. As a result of the suit, Irjax eventually acquired \\"a sizable chunk of the direct-distribution market,\\" and many of Seulings's sub-distributors left Sea Gate to become independent distributors. = Death = Seuling died of a rare liver diseaseSchelly, p. 108 on August 21, 1984.\\"Phil Seuling, father of the direct-sales Market, dies at age of 50,\\" The Comics Journal #93 (September 1984), pp. 13-14. The following year, Sea Gate closed down.\\"Newswatch: Pioneering direct-sales distributor Sea Gate files for bankruptcy,\\" The Comics Journal #101 (August 1985), pp. 17-18. Distribution competitors Bud Plant, Inc., and Capital City Distribution opened \\"an expanded facility in Sea Gate's old space in Sparta, alongside the [defunct publisher Pacific Comics'] printing plant.\\"  Personal life  By 1957, Seuling was married to Carole Seuling, with whom he had two daughters, Gwenn and Heather. Carole Seuling would do a small amount of writing for comics, including co- creating, with artist George Tuska, Marvel Comics' jungle-girl heroine Shanna the She-Devil in 1972.  Awards  Seuling was presented with an Inkpot Award at the 1974 San Diego Comic-Con. In 1985, he was posthumously named as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great.

Born in Tehran, Ghiyas Beg belonged to a family of poets and high officials. Nevertheless, his fortunes fell into disfavor after the death of his father in 1576. Along with his pregnant wife Asmat Begum, and his three children, they immigrated to India. There he was received by the Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605), and was enrolled into his service. During the latters reign, Ghiyas Beg was appointed treasurer for the province of Kabul. His fortunes further increased during the reign of Akbar's son and successor Jahangir (r. 1605-1627), who in 1611 married his daughter Nur Jahan and appointed Ghiyas Beg as his Prime minister. By 1615, Ghiyas Beg had risen to further prominence, when he was given the status of 6,000 men and was given a standard and drums, a prestige normally restricted for distinguished princes. Family Ghiyas Beg was a native of Tehran, and was the youngest son of Khvajeh Mohammad-Sharif, a poet and vizier of Mohammad Khan Tekkelu and his son Tatar Soltan, who was the governor of the Safavid province of Khorasan. Mohammad-Sharif was later listed under the service of Shah Tahmasp I (r. 1524‚Äì1576), where he in the start served as the vizier of Yazd, Abarkuh, and Biabanak for seven years. Thereafter he was appointed as the vizier of Isfahan, and died there in 1576. Ghiyas Beg's elder brother, Mohammad-Taher Wasli, was a learned man who composed poetry under the pen name of Wasli. Immigration to India After the death of Ghiyas' father, his family fell into disgrace. Hoping to improve his family‚Äôs fortunes, Ghiyas Beg chose to relocate to India where the Emperor Akbar's court was said to be at the centre of the growing trade industry and cultural scene. Half way along their route the family was attacked by robbers who took from them the remaining meager possessions they had. Left with only two mules, Ghiyas Beg, his pregnant wife, and their three children (Mohammad- Sharif, Asaf Khan and a daughter Sahlia) were forced to take turns riding on the backs of the animals for the rest of their journey. When the family arrived in Kandahar, Asmat Begam gave birth to their second daughter. The family was so impoverished, they feared they would be unable to take care of the newborn baby. Fortunately, the family was taken in by a caravan led by the merchant noble Malik Masud, who would later assist Ghiyas Beg in finding a job in the service of Emperor Akbar. Believing that the child had signaled a change in the family‚Äôs fate, she was named Mehrunnisa, meaning \\"sun among women\\". Ghiyas Beg was not the first member of his family to move to India‚Äîhis cousin Asaf Khan Jafar Beg and the uncle of Asmat Begum, Mirza Ghiyasuddin Ali Asaf Khan, had been enrolled into the provincial assignments of Akbar. Service under the Mughal Empire Ghiyas was later appointed diwan (treasurer) for the province of Kabul. Due to his astute skills at conducting business he quickly rose through the ranks of the high administrative officials. For his excellent work he was awarded the title of ‚Äò‚ÄòItimad-ud- Daula‚Äò‚Äò (‚ÄòPillar of the State‚Äô) by the emperor. As a result of his work and promotions, Ghiyas Beg was able to ensure that Mehrunnisa (the future Nur Jahan) would have the best possible education. She became well versed in Arabic and Persian. She also became well versed in art, literature, music and dance. Mirza Ghiyas Beg's tomb in Agra Ghiyas' daughter, Mehrunissa (Nur Jahan) married Akbar's son Jahangir in 1611, and his son Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan served as a general to Jahangir. Ghiyas was also the grandfather of Mumtaz Mahal (originally named Arjumand Bano, daughter of Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan), the wife of the emperor Shah Jahan, responsible for the building of the Taj Mahal. Jahangir was succeeded by his son Shah Jahan, and Abdul Hasan served as one of Shah Jahan's closest advisors. Shah Jahan married Abdul Hasan's daughter Arjumand Banu Begum, MumtƒÅz Mahal, who was the mother of his four sons, including his successor Aurangzeb. Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal to serve as Mumtaz Mahal's tomb.  Death and burial  Ghiyas Beg died near Kangra in 1622 while the Mughal camp was moving towards its summer residence in Kashmir. His body was carried back to Agra, where he was buried on the right bank of the Yamuna river. His burial place still stands till this day, and is known as Tomb of I'timad-ud-Daulah.

The core brand is Blumarine, which they started in 1977, followed by Miss Blumarine (1987, 8- to 14-year-old girls), Blugirl (1995, for teenagers) and Anna Molinari (1995), which is being repositioned as their luxury brand. History Anna Molinari in 2010 A Blumarine blouse Blumarine was established by Anna Molinari and Gianpaolo Tarabini in 1977, in the town of Carpi in the province of Modena. The name was inspired by the couple's favourite colour and their love of the sea. In 1980 they made their first appearance at Modit in Milan, where Blumarine was named Designer of the Year, which led to their first show at Milan Fashion Week the following year. The 1986 Milan Fashion Week saw the first collection wholly designed by Anna Molinari. As the brand took off and they started to license it to other companies, Blufin was set up in 1988 to act as a holding company. By 2006 royalties accounted for ‚Ç¨5.5m of their income. The first Blumarine boutique was opened in the Via della Spiga, Milan in 1990; the company now sells at more than 1000 retail outlets, of which 55 are own-brand boutiques. In July 2011 the company collection was presented at the catwalk of The Brandery fashion show in Barcelona.The Brandery, Catwalk, TV Fashion Runway Show Brands The core brand is Blumarine, which has also been licensed to other companies in the fields of lingerie, accessories, wristwatches, homeware and so on; the perfume licence is held by ICR-ITF. In 2007, the company announced that it would be bringing bags and small leather accessories in-house, with a dedicated display area in the Milan shop at Via Montenapoleone 20. A major international expansion of Blumarine boutiques was then also planned, particularly in the Middle East and Asia. The same is true of the Blugirl brand for young women, launched in 1995 and shown in the Milan international fashion shows since 2002. Dedicated boutiques have been opened in Rome, Milan, Naples, Paris, Kiev, Kyoto, Nagoya, Taipei, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, and Seoul. Blugirl Folies is a brand launched in the market in 2007, aimed at younger teenage girls, integrating the Blugirl line. In February 2015, the company launched a male fashion line, Blu Sport, at Milan Fashion Week. Family Anna Molinari has received many awards, of which the most notable are perhaps the Isimbardi Fashion Award in 2001, and a La Kore Fashion Oscar ion 2003. She has also been involved with many charities, such as the Italian Osteoporosis League and the rehabilitation of prisoners. As mentioned above, the couple's daughter Rossella is a designer for the company. Her brother Gianguido Tarabini joined the company in 1992, became Director of Licensing in 2004, and since the death of his father in 2006 has been the CEO in charge of all the company's commercial affairs and responsible for the Hotel Touring owned directly by his mother, separately from Blufin.

The municipality of Sud Mennucci, S√£o Paulo has been named in his honor. Mennucci was born in Piracicaba, state of S√£o Paulo. In 1910 he started his career as a teacher in a rural school. In 1913 he moved to Bel√©m, in the state of Par√°, invited to reorganize the Escolas de Aprendizes de Marinheiros de Bel√©m do Par√° until 1914. Back to S√£o Paulo, he continued to work as a teacher in the cities of Porto Ferreira and S√£o Paulo City. In 1920, he was the coordinator of the school census of the state, which led the reorganization of the state secretary of education into 15 regional offices. Briefly after that, he was appointed as the director of the regional office of Campinas. Mennucci's career as a journalist started in 1925. Until 1931, he worked as an editor and literary critic at the O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper. In that year, he was promoted to the general directorship of the state secretary of education of the state of S√£o Paulo.

The governor-captain general was also president of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala, the superior court.  Antecedents  Colonization of the area that became the Captaincy General began in 1524. In the north, the brothers Gonzalo and Pedro de Alvarado, Hern√°n Cort√©s and others headed various expeditions into Guatemala and Honduras. In the south Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, acting under the auspices of Pedro Arias D√°vila in Panama, moved into what is today Nicaragua. = Moving of the capital = The colonial coat of arms of Antigua Guatemala and Guatemala City. The capital of Guatemala has moved many times over the centuries. On 27 July 1524, Pedro de Alvarado declared the Kaqchikel city Iximche the first regional capital, styled Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (\\"St. James of the Knights of Guatemala\\").Schele & Mathews 1999, p.297. Recinos 1998, p.101. Guillem√≠n 1965, p.10. However, hostilities between the Spaniards and the Kaqchikel soon made the city uninhabitable. In 1526 the Spanish founded a new capital at Tecp√°n Guatemala. Tecp√°n is the Nahuatl word for \\"palace\\".Schele & Mathews 1999, p.299. Tecp√°n is sometimes called the \\"first\\" capital because it was the first permanent Spanish military center, but the Spaniards soon abandoned it due to Kaqchikel attacks that made defense of the city untenable. In 1527, the capital was moved to the Almolonga Valley to the east, on the site of today's San Miguel Escobar district of Ciudad Vieja, near Antigua Guatemala.Lutz 1997, pp.10, 258. Ortiz Flores 2008. This settlement was destroyed by a catastrophic lahar from Volcan de Agua in 1541, and the survivors abandoned the site. In 1543, the capital was again refounded several kilometres away at Antigua Guatemala. Over the next two centuries, this city would become one of the richest of the New World capitals. However, it too was destroyed, this time by a devastating series of earthquakes, and the city was ordered abandoned in 1776. The final and current capital is the modern-day Guatemala City. = Role of the church = The Church played an important role in the administration of the overseas possessions of the Spanish crown. The first dioceses were established in Le√≥n, Nicaragua and Guatemala in 1534. Another diocese was created in Chiapas in 1539. The dioceses of Guatemala and Chiapas were suffragan to the Archdiocese of Seville, until 1546 when they were placed under the Archdiocese of Mexico. The Diocese of Le√≥n was made suffragan to Archdiocese of Lima in 1546. Another short-lived diocese was set up in Verapaz, Guatemala in 1559. Along the Caribbean coast, there were several attempts to establish a diocese in Honduras‚Äîwhich finally succeeded in 1561 with the Diocese of Comayagua‚Äîwhich was placed under the Archdiocese of Santo Domingo. In 1543 the territory of the kingdom was defined with the establishment of the Audiencia of Guatemala, which took most of Central America as its jurisdiction. This audiencia, along with the one in Lima, took over the territory of the first Audiencia of Panama. It was the first institution to define Central America (with the exception of Panama) as a region within the Spanish Empire. Establishment The Fort of San Fernando Omoa. Built by the Spaniards to defend against pirates. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general, when the governor and Audiencia president was also granted the title of captain general to deal with foreign threats to the area from the Caribbean, granting the area autonomy in administrative and military matters. Around the same time Habsburg Spain created other captaincies general in Puerto Rico (1580), Cuba (1607) and Yucat√°n (1617). In the 17th century, a process of uniting the church hierarchy of Central America also began. The dioceses of Comayagua and Le√≥n became suffragan to the Archdiocese of Mexico in 1620 and 1647, respectively. Finally, in the 18th century, Guatemala was raised to an archdiocese in 1743 and the dioceses of Le√≥n, Chiapas and Comayagua were made suffragan to it, giving the region unity and autonomy in religious matters. As part of the Bourbon Reforms in 1786 the crown established a series of intendancies in the area, which replaced most of the older corregimientos. The intendants were granted broad fiscal powers and charged with promoting the local economy. The new intendancies were San Salvador (El Salvador), Ciudad Real (Chiapas), Comayagua (Honduras), and Le√≥n (Nicaragua). The governor-captain general- president of Guatemala became the superintendente general of the territory and functioned as the de facto intendant of Guatemala proper. The agricultural, southern region of Costa Rica remained under a civil and military governor with fiscal oversight only over military expenses; the expenses of the civil government were handled by the intendant of Le√≥n. These intendancies helped shape local political identity and provided the basis of the future nations of Central America. Independence With the removal of Ferdinand VII during the Peninsular War, independence movements broke out in the intendancies of San Salvador and Le√≥n in 1811, which were quickly suppressed. In 1812 the Cortes of C√°diz divided the region into two provinces: Guatemala (consisting of Guatemala, Belize, Chiapas, Honduras and El Salvador) and Nicaragua y Costa Rica. These provinces existed from 1812 to 1814 and once again from 1820 to 1821, the period during which the Spanish Constitution of 1812 was in effect. The two provinces elected seven deputies to the Cortes during the first period.Rieu-Millan, Marie Laure. Los diputados americanos en las Cortes de C√°diz: Igualdad o independencia . Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas, 1990. 43. The jefe pol√≠tico superior (governor) of Guatemala remained the Captain General of Central America and Chiapas. The Captaincy General ended in 1821 with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America, after which the regional elite supported the Plan of Iguala and joined the First Mexican Empire by annexation. With the exception of Chiapas, the region peacefully seceded from Mexico in July 1823, establishing the United Provinces of Central America. While the region remained politically cohesive for a short time, centrifugal forces soon pulled the individual provinces apart by 1842.

The SAS series has sold a reported 120 million copies worldwide, which would make it one of the top-selling series in history, on a par with Ian Fleming's James Bond books. SAS may be the longest-running fiction series ever written by a single author.\\" De Villiers' books are well known in French-speaking countries for their in-depth insider knowledge of such subjects as espionage, geopolitics, and terrorist threats, as well as their hard-core sex scenes. Vintage Books worked with his estate to publish his books in English translations posthumously, beginning in 2014 with The Madmen of Benghazi and Chaos in Kabul, Revenge of the Kremlin in 2015, and Lord of the Swallows in February 2016. Surface to Air was published in June 2016. All were translated by veteran literary translator William Rodarmor and bought de Villiers and his hero Malko Linge to English-speaking readers. Life Born in Paris in 1929, Villiers was the son of playwright Jacques Adam de Villiers (known by his stage name of Jacques Deval) and his wife. His father was both prolific and a spendthrift. The younger Villiers attended high school and graduated from Sciences Po university in Paris. He also obtained a degree from the √âcole sup√©rieure de journalisme de Paris. He began writing in the 1950s for France Soir, a French daily, and became a foreign correspondent. He found \\"the blend of risk and cold calculation\\" in intelligence work to be \\"seductive\\". In 1964 Villiers began to write and publish spy novels. He continued to cultivate his connections among the military and intelligence services. He is the author of the spy novel series SAS, publishing his first volume in 1965. It tells the adventures of the Austrian prince and CIA agent Malko Linge, referred to in the first title as SAS. This is a play on initials and acronyms: Firstly, Son Altesse s√©r√©nissime (SAS) is the French version of \\"His Serene Highness\\" (HSH). Secondly, the British Special Air Service (SAS) is the principal special forces unit of the British Army. Thirdly, the SAS series has always included product (airlines and spirits) placement from varying sponsors over the years. One of the first sponsors was Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), which flew the hero around in the beginning, although he later set his heart (and the author's wallet) on Air France. Villiers wrote 200 novels in this franchise,Publisher's web site, accessed 2 November 2013 selling more than 120 million books. In addition to France, they were translated and popular in Germany, Russia, Turkey, and Japan; and, since some have been published in English since 2014, in the United States and other English-speaking countries. They are said to be studied by various intelligence services and enjoyed by successive French heads of state. Villiers published four titles per year between 1966 and 2005, increasing his production to five per year between 2006 and his death in 2013. Usually the locale of the story is featured in the title (as in, Les amazones de Pyongyang' [The Amazons of Pyongyang] or Putsch √† Ouagadougou [Coup in Ouagadougou]). Villiers was well known for writing novels that incorporated contemporary events, such as wars or terrorist threats. He frequently visited theaters of operation, doing research and interviews to ground his stories with accurate facts.Hugh Schofield, \\"Get out of Afghanistan: France's million-selling spy writer\\", Sunday Times Online, Sri Lanka, 7 October 2007, accessed 4 July 2011 He typically researched each book by 15 days on location and then wrote it in another six weeks. His sales were at a peak in the 1980s, but in the early 21st century, Villiers was still earning \\"between 800,000 and a million euros a year (roughly $1 million to $1.3 million)\\" for his books.Robert F. Worth, \\"The Spy Novelist Who Knows Too Much\\", New York Times, 03 February 2013; accessed 14 November 2018 This enabled him to keep a villa in St. Tropez and a \\"grand house\\" on Avenue Foch in Paris. Villiers's mastery of international politics sometimes resulted in his publishing books that seem \\"prophetic\\". His Le Chemin de Damas (2012) was set in the middle of Syria's 21st-century civil war, and it described an attack on a government command center near the presidential palace, a month before such an attack took place. In an earlier book, he portrayed the assassinations of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat before the fact. Due to tips from spies, he was nearly finished writing SAS: The Hunt for Carlos when the freelance assassin known as Carlos the Jackal was captured.Alan Riding, \\"France's James Bond Gets the Scoop on the Hunt for Carlos\\", New York Times, 18 September 1994, accessed 4 July 2011 English translations In the mid-1970s, Pinnacle Books published a dozen of the early SAS novels in English, which are now out of print. They include The Belfast Connection (, Furie √† Belfast) in 1976.

For the footballer, please see Dan Harding. Daniel Harding (2011) Daniel Harding (born 31 August 1975) is a British conductor. Biography Harding was born in Oxford. He studied trumpet at Chetham's School of Music and was a member of the National Youth Orchestra at age 13. At age 17, Harding assembled a group of musicians to perform Pierrot Lunaire of Arnold Schoenberg, and sent a tape of the performance to Simon Rattle in Birmingham. After listening to this tape, Rattle hired Harding as an assistant to him at the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra for a year, from 1993 to 1994. Harding then attended the University of Cambridge, but after his first year at university, Claudio Abbado named him his assistant with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Harding first conducted the Berlin Philharmonic at age 21. At the time of his first conducting appearance at The Proms in 1996, he was then the youngest-ever conductor to appear there. Harding has stated that he has never had formal conducting lessons. He is a former Seiji Ozawa Fellow in conducting at Tanglewood Music Center. In 1997, Harding was the Music Director of the Ojai Music Festival alongside pianist Emanuel Ax. Harding has been music director of the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra (1997‚Äì2000), the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (1999‚Äì2003) and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra (2003‚Äì2008). Harding now has the title of conductor laureate with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. He conducted the 2005 opening night at La Scala, Milan in Idomeneo, as a substitute after the resignation of Riccardo Muti earlier in 2005. In 2004, Harding was appointed principal guest conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), as of 2006. One of his new projects with the LSO involved the Sound Adventures program for new compositions. With the LSO, he has conducted a commercial recording of the opera Billy Budd for EMI Classics. He became the Principal Conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in 2007. In September 2009, he extended his contract as the orchestra's principal conductor through 2012. In April 2013, the orchestra further announced the extension of Harding's contract to 2015. With the orchestra, he has recorded commercially for the Sony Classical label. In June 2015, the Orchestre de Paris announced the appointment of Harding as its 9th principal conductor, effective September 2016. Harding concluded his tenure in the Orchestre de Paris post following the close of the 2018-2019 season. In October 2018, the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra announced the extension of Harding's contract as principal conductor through 2023, along with granting him the new title of konstn√§rlig ledare (artistic leader). Outside of Europe, in September 2010, Harding took the title of music partner of the New Japan Philharmonic. In April 2012, Harding became artistic director of the Ohga Hall in Karuizawa, Japan. Harding has two children, Adele and George, from his past marriage to B√©atrice Muthelet, a violist and co-principal violist of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. The marriage ended in divorce. Harding is a particular fan of the football club Manchester United. Harding is a licensed airline pilot, and in 2019 had announced his intention in 2020 to take a sabbatical from conducting to be a commercial pilot with Air France, plans now delayed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

They are flattened, spiderlike flies without eyes or wings, and are seldom encountered by general collectors, as they almost never leave the bodies of their hosts. Both males and females take blood meals, thus they qualify as real parasites. Most species are highly host-specific.

The painting depicts four young girls, the daughters of Edward Darley Boit, in their family's Paris apartment. It was painted in 1882 and is now exhibited in the new Art of the Americas Wing of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The painting hangs between the two tall blue-and-white Japanese vases depicted in the work; they were donated by the heirs of the Boit family.\\"Vase with decoration of birds and flowers\\" Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Retrieved on 1 May 2010. It has been described as \\"Arguably the most psychologically compelling painting of Sargent's career\\".Gallati, p. 81 Though the painting's unusual composition was noted from its earliest viewings, initially its subject was interpreted simply as that of girls at play, but it has subsequently been viewed in more abstract terms, reflecting Freudian analysis and a greater interest in the ambiguities of adolescence.Gallati, p. 157 Edward Boit was the son-in-law of John Perkins Cushing and a friend of Sargent's. Boit was an \\"American cosmopolite\\" and a minor painter.Gallati, p. 81 His wife and the mother of his five children was Mary Louisa Cushing, known as \\"Isa\\". Their four daughters were Florence, Jane, Mary Louisa and Julia. Composition It is not certain whether The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit was commissioned by Boit or painted at Sargent's suggestion.Killmurray, Ormond, p. 98 Set in what is thought to be the foyer of Boit's Paris apartment,Gallati, p. 81 its dark interior space is reminiscent of those Sargent had recently painted in Venice. The composition was unusual for a group portrait, both for the varying degrees of prominence given to the figures‚Äîconventional group portraiture called for an arrangement in which the subjects were portrayed as equally important‚Äîand for the square shape of the canvas. The dimensions may owe something to the influence of Diego Vel√°zquez's Las Meninas, which Sargent had copied, and which presages the geometric format and broad, deep spaces of Sargent's painting.Prettejohn, p. 23 When the painting was first exhibited, contemporary critics, including Henry James, wrote of Sargent's debt to Vel√°zquez.Gallati, pp. 81-84 The work of Diego Vel√°zquez in general, and Las Meninas in particular, influenced Sargent's composition.Prettejohn, p. 23Tinterow, Lacambre, p.533 Art historian Barbara Gallati notes that the English translation of Las Meninas, \\"Maids-in-Waiting\\", is an apt description for the activity of the Boit children.Gallati, p. 83 Carolus-Duran, Sargent's teacher, had encouraged his students to study the work of Vel√°zquez. The relationship between the works is considered so significant that the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston) loaned The Daughters to the Museo del Prado in 2010, so that the paintings could be exhibited together for the first time.Brown, Mark. \\"Gallery deal brings masterpieces of childhood together at last\\". The Guardian, 3 December 2009. Retrieved on May 1, 2010. The brushwork of several passages has been seen as deriving from Frans Hals, and nearly contemporaneous works that have been cited for their similarities are Madame Georges Charpentier and Her Children by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and, especially for its psychological complexity, The Bellelli Family by Edgar Degas.Tinterow, Lacambre, p.534 Dressed in white pinafores, the children are arranged so that the youngest, four-year-old Julia, sits on the floor, eight- year-old Mary Louisa stands at left, and the two oldest, Jane, aged twelve, and Florence, fourteen, stand in the background, partially obscured by shadow. In very nearly hiding one of the girl's faces and subjugating the characterization of individuals to more formal compositional considerations, The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit is as much about the subject of childhood as it is an example of portraiture.Prettejohn, p. 22 Interpretation When the painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1882 and 1883, critics were struck by the oddness of the composition and \\"wooden forms\\" of the figures.Prettejohn, p. 23 In 1887, Henry James described the painting as representing a \\"happy play-world ... of charming children\\"; his uncomplicated reading went largely unquestioned for nearly a century. Modern criticism has acknowledged the painting's unsettling qualities, that it is a picture both beautifully painted and psychologically unnerving, in which the girls appear to be seen at successive phases of childhood, retreating into alienation and a loss of innocence as they grow older.Prettejohn, p. 23 The sense of autonomy among the girls (and the vitality of Sargent's paint) has often made viewers feel as if by looking at the portrait, they have interrupted the children, who glance up in response. While today's audiences have sometimes assumed that the girls are engaged in some sort of clandestine activity, in Sargent's day the most frequent notion was that they had simply been playing. The pinafores were certainly appropriate garments for girls at play, and the majority of writers who discussed the painting when it was first displayed characterized it as an image of children participating in or having just finished a game.Hirshler, Erica E. (2009). p. 91. Sargent‚Äôs Daughters, MFA Publications, Boston. . Gallati has suggested that the placement of the two oldest girls, at the edge of a darkened and ambiguous entryway, is symbolic of their maturation into an unknown future.Gallati, p. 83 Several art historians have interpreted the painting as revealing Sargent's psychosexual thoughts.Gallati, p. 82. David Lubin finds sexual connotations in the name \\"Boit\\" (bo√Æte is French for \\"box\\"), the boxy shape of the canvas, and the womblike interior space the girls inhabit. In the succeeding years, none of the girls would marry, and the two oldest suffered emotional disturbances in maturity. In 1919, the four sisters gave the painting to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in memory of their father. Author Bill Brown has noted the \\"uncanny qualities\\" of the depiction of the girls and the vases, which he asserts promote \\"an indeterminate ontology [because of] the inability to distinguish between the animate and the inanimate\\". Brown claims that the painting offers a portrait of vases and a still life of the girls, and that this \\"discloses a dialectic of person and thing\\".Brown, Bill.A Sense of Things: The Object Matter of American Literature, Chicago University Press, p.260 Notes References * Brown, Bill.

He was also the first husband of Nur Jahan (Mehrunissa), who later married Jahangir after Ali Quli Khan's death and became Empress of India. He was given the title Sher Afgan Khan (\\"tiger grappler\\"), by Prince Salim, Jahangir, after his meritorious actions, during a war with the Rana of Mewar. Ali Quli Khan Istajlu, was educated under the instructions of Shah Ismail II of Safavid dynasty in Iran.From the Memoirs of the W√°z√≠rs, Iqbalnama The History of India, Sir H. M. Elliot, London, 1867‚Äì1877, Volume 6, chpt. 148. Like his wife, Sher Afgan was also an immigrant from Persia, who fled from Iran, to Kandahar, then in India. He was the father of a daughter called Mihr-un-nissa Begum, after she married Prince Shahryar, the fifth and youngest son of Jahangir and rival to Shah Jahan.Ali Q (Beg, Istajlu, Sher Afgan Khan) Ain-i- Akbari, by Abul Fazl, tr.

Istajlu (Ustajlu), a Turkmen tribe surname Biography =Life= Ali Quli Khan Istajlu was a member of the Turkoman Ustajlu tribe, and was the safarchi (table-attendant) of Ismail II, the third Safavid king (shah) of Persia (1576‚Äì78). After the Shah's death, Ali Quli came to Kandahar, and at Multan he met Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana who made him a royal employee while in the field. Later, on Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana's recommendation, Ali Quli received a mansab, Thatta (in present-day Pakistan). During the following years he rendered distinguished services to Akbar, and moved to the royal courts at Lahore.History of Begum Nur Jahan, by Sugam Anand, 1992, Radha Publications, Queens. . Page 34-36. Soon after his arrival at the royal courts in 1594, Ain-e-Akbari suggests, Akbar ordered his marriage to the seventeen-year-old Mehrunissa (the future Empress Nur Jahan), daughter of Mirza Ghias Beg.Nur Jahan Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals Part ‚Äì II, by Satish Chandra, 2000, Har Anand Publications. . Page 237. Ghias‚Äôs wife had access to the royal harem, and on her visits there she was often accompanied by Mehrunissa. There Prince Salim reportedly saw her and fell in love with her, and to avoid scandal, Akbar quickly married her to Ali Quli. Some historians suggest that when Prince Salim saw her, she was already engaged to be married to Ali Quli, and thus the prince couldn't marry her on that account. When Prince Salim revolted against Akbar, Ali Quli sided with Akbar against the prince, but when Salim finally ascended to the Mughal throne in 1605 and took the name Jahangir, he pardoned Ali Quli along with all those who favoured Akbar instead of him. Ali Quli was made a jagirdar and received the region of Bardhaman in West Bengal as his domain. =Death= Tomb of Sher Afgan Khan and Qutbuddin in Bahram Saqqa mosque complex Shaikh Khubu, Qutbuddin Khan Koka, (Khan-i-Chishti), was the foster-brother of Jahangir, as his mother was a daughter of Shaikh Salim. When Jahangir ascended the throne of Mughal Empire in 1605, Qutbuddin was made the subedar (Governor) of Bengal, by replacing Raja Man Singh. Meanwhile, Sher Afgan Ali Quli Istajlu was tahvildar of Bardhaman, also in the province of Bengal. Numerous Mansabs and titles were bestowed on his son Sheikh Farid who eventually became the Governor of Budaun. His descendants still live in a fort (now in ruins) in Sheikhupur, Budaun. In 1607, Qutbuddin Khan Koka was instructed to send Sher Afgan Khan to the court as he was accused of negligence and siding with Afghan rebels and transferred. Sher Afgan Khan refused to obey. Seeing this, Qutbuddin started off for Bardhaman, while he sent Ghiasa, the son of his sister, in advance to pacify Sher Afgan and bring him to the court. So upon his arrival on 30 May 1607, Sher Afgan duly went to meet him, accompanied by two men. At that moment Qutb signalled his men to arrest Sher Afgan, who stepped forward in alarm and attacked Qutbuddin sensing treachery. Qutbuddin was fatally wounded, and seeing this, his men surrounded Sher Afgan and killed him instantly.Shaikh Khubu, Qutbuddin Khan i Chishti of Fatehpur Sikri Ain-i- Akbari, by Abul Fazl, tr. H. Blochmann, The Asiatic Society of Bengal., Calcutta, 1873. Volume I, chapt. 299. Qutbuddin, who was fatally wounded, died later in the night. This caused much grief to Jahangir as he mentions in his memoirs, Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, where he also mentions his elation at the death of Ali Quli and hopes that \\"the blackfaced wretch will forever remain in hell\\".Ali Quli Istajlu Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, The Memoirs of Jahangir (Rogers), Volume 1, chapt. 27. The claim that Ali Quli was killed because the emperor coveted his wife has been discounted by many later historians, who cite the fact that if Jahangir had had any such intentions, he wouldn't have bestowed upon Ali Quli the title Sher Afgan, or pardoned him after he ascended the throne, or given him Bardhaman.Ali Quli Istajlu The Mughal Empire: From Babar to Aurangzeb, by S. M. Jaffar, London, 1936, p. 195-196, marriage and thereafter. P. 197-198, death controversy. Another historical writer, Khafi Khan, mentions another tale about Ali Quli's death, which is said to have been related by Nur Jahan's mother. According to her, Sher Aghan did not die immediately when he was attacked by Qutbuddin's men, but wounded as he was, he managed to get to the door of his house with the intention of killing his wife, whom he did not wish to fall into the emperor's hands. But her mother would not let him enter, and told him to mind his wounds, especially as Mehrunissa had committed suicide by throwing herself into a well. \\"Having heard the sad news, Sher Afgan went to the heavenly mansions.\\" Historians do not credit this tale, however. His tomb is situated within the shrine complex of the poet Bahram Saqqa, in the present day city of Bardhaman in West Bengal, next to the tomb of Qutbuddin.The Journal of the United Service Institution of India, by United Service Institution of India, 1872, Page 171. \\"..the unusual story behind the adjacent tombs of Sher Afgan and Qutb-ud-din at Bardhaman ...\\" Nur Jahan's remarriage After Ali Quli's death, his wife Mehrunissa, was sent to the royal harem, where she spent next four years as lady-in- waiting to Ruqaiya Sultan Begum. As the story progresses, in March 1611, during the New Year Day Nauroz celebrations, Prince Salim happened to see Mehrunissa at Meena Bazar Agra and immediately proposed her for marriage but actually their connection was even before the marriage of Nurjahan and Ali Quli. Mehrunissa and Prince Salim were married two months later, on 25 May 1611, which made her Jahangir's twentieth wife as Nur Mahal, 'Light of the castle', and in 1616, she was given the title Nur Jahan, 'the Light of the World'.The Marriage of Jah√°ng√≠r with N√∫r Jah√°n The History of India, Volume 6, chpt. 151. Ali Quli's daughter, Mihr-un-nissa Begum, was married to Prince Shahryar, Jahangir's fifth son in 1620. Shahryar went on to briefly occupy the Mughal throne at Lahore, under the manoeuvring of Nur Jahan, after the death of Jahangir on 27 October 1627. He was later captured by Mughal forces led by Asaf Khan, and ‚àí first blinded by the orders of Prince Dawar ‚àí was later executed by Asaf Khan, at the order of Shah Jahan, who finally ascended the Mughal throne after executing all his remaining brothers. After Qutubuddin's death, the next subedar of Bengal was Murshid Quli Khan (1607‚Äì1608) and when he died, Islam Khan (June 1608‚Äìdied August 1613).Bengal under Mughals References Sources  External links * Nur Jahan * History Mughal nobility 1607 deaths History of Bengal Year of birth unknown Ethnic Turkmen people ","title":"Sher Afgan Khan"},{"id":"3821552","text":"Benny Moten (November 30, 1916 - March 27, 1977) was an American jazz bassist.

Oil was discovered there in 1956 and the town's prominence has grown rapidly since then; it is considered as the First Energy town in Algeria where all the big oil and gas companies have offices and bases. It is an oil refinery town named after the first oil well. A water well, dug in 1917, can be found on the airport side of town. Today there are over 800 wells within a radius of the town.  History  The Historical Hassi Messaoud Well The Name Hassi Messaoud means \\"the well of Messaoud\\" in Arabic, named after Messaoud Rouabeh, a well-digger in the region. Before the discovery of oil in the region, Hassi Messaoud was not very populated. After discovering oil in the region in the 1950s the French built two petroleum bases. After the nationalization of oil and gas in the early 70s, the bases became property of Sonatrach (the national oil and gas company). In 1984, and after a new administrative zoning, Hassi Messaoud became a municipality (a local district) with a local assembly. After that date people started populating the town independently. Sonatrach has imported ready-built houses, approximately 2000 units. Now Hassi Messaoud is a town with more than 60,000 inhabitants (non official source), without counting those living in the oil and gas company bases. The town contains several bases for the oil and gas companies, where Algerian and foreign people are working and living. As of 2008, Hassi Messaoud has an oil field with estimated reserves of 8 billion barrels, and the Hassi R ÃìMel gasfield has estimated reserves of 50 trillion cubic feet of gas and 2 billion barrels of crude oil. =Attacks against women= In 2010 Amnesty International reported that mob attacks against single women accused of being prostitutes were taking place in Hassi Messaoud. According to Amnesty International there are reports that \\"some women have been sexually abused\\" and were targeted \\"not just because they are women, but because they are living alone and are economically independent.\\"  Climate  Hassi Messaoud has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh) with long, extremely hot summers and short, warm winters and little rainfall throughout the year. Averages high temperatures are consistently over during 4 months (June, July, August and September) to reach a maximum of over in July but temperatures have been known to sometimes soar to or even above. Temperatures in January range from at night to . The annual average high temperature is and the average low temperature is . Average annual rainfall is about . The absolute highest temperature ever recorded is but the absolute lowest temperature ever recorded is . Sand storms are common before summer time (from March to June), lasting from 6 hours to 4 days. These storms vary in their intensity but in general they prevent any outdoors activity and driving becomes very hazardous.  Transportation  The town has a coach and taxi station which serves all major cities in the country. It is served by the Oued Irara Airport, located 8.5 km southeast of the city centre. It features domestic scheduled passenger service. Hassi Messaoud lies on the N3 national highway between Touggourt and Biskra to the north and Illizi and Djanet to the south. To the north of the town, the N49 branches off the N3 to the west, connecting to Ouargla.

The Captaincy General encompassed the Spanish East Indies, which included among others the Philippine Islands and the Caroline Islands. It was founded in 1565 with the first permanent Spanish settlements. For centuries, all the political and economic aspects of the Captaincy General were administered in Mexico City by the Viceroyalty of New Spain, while the administrative issues had to be consulted with the Spanish Crown or the Council of the Indies through the Royal Audience of Manila. However, in 1821, following the independence of Mexico, all control was transferred to Madrid. It was succeeded by the short- lived First Philippine Republic following its independence through the Philippine Revolution. History =Early explorations= Manila Galleon by the Chamorro in the Ladrones Islands, ca. 1590 Boxer Codex After a long, tolling voyage across the Pacific Ocean, Ferdinand Magellan reached the island of Guam on March 6, 1521 and anchored the three ships that were left of his fleet in Umatac Bay, before proceeding to the Philippines, where he met his death during the Battle of Mactan. Antonio Pigafetta, the expedition's chronicler and one of only 18 original crew members to survive Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe, recorded all details of the voyage. Magellan landing site in Umatac Bay Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi arrived in Umatac in 1565 and claimed the island of Guam for Spain, before proceeding to the Philippines, where, in a short period of time, they successfully incorporated into Spain's empire Cebu, Samar, Mazaua, Leyte, and Bohol, before conquering Manila. Later (in 1569), Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi transferred the Spanish headquarters from Cebu to Panay, where they found allies, who were never conquered by Spain but were accomplished as vassals by means of pacts, peace treaties, and reciprocal alliances.Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 4. Also cf. Antonio Morga, Sucessos de las Islas Filipinas, 2nd ed., Paris: 1890, p. xxxiii. On 5 June 1569, Guido de Lavezaris, the royal treasurer in the archipelago, wrote to Philip II reporting about the Portuguese attack on Cebu in the preceding autumn. A letter from another official, Andres de Mirandaola (dated three days later, on 8 June), also described briefly this encounter with the Portuguese. The danger of another attack led the Spaniards to remove their camp from Cebu to Panay, which they considered a safer place. Legazpi himself, in his report to the Viceroy in New Spain (dated 1 July 1569), mentioned the same reason for the relocation of Spaniards to Panay.Cf.

Two of Lepazpi's lieutenant-commanders, Mart√≠n de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo, conquered Luzon's northern region. Several Pacific islands were claimed by Spain during the 16th century, including the Caroline Islands by Toribio Alonso de Salazar in 1526, Palau by Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos in 1543, Bonin Islands by Bernardo de la Torre in 1543, New Guinea by Y√±igo Ortiz de Retez in 1545, Solomon Islands by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa in 1568, New Hebrides by Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s in 1606, and Marquesas Islands by √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira in 1595, although Spain did not make any serious attempt to establish permanent settlements in them until the 18th century.

In 1584, the Real Audiencia of Manila was established by King Felipe II, who appointed as its President the same governor of the Captaincy General of the Philippines. The Captaincy General had its capital in Cebu from 1565 to 1595, and in Manila from 1595 until 1898. As part of the extensive governmental reforms during the early Bourbon period throughout the overseas possessions, an Intendencia was established in Manila by Royal Decree of July 17, 1784 that handled issues regarding the government finances and to promote the economy. Ciriaco Gonz√°lez Carbajal was appointed as Oidor of the Audiencia of Manila and was instructed to abide by the Royal Ordinance of Mayors of 1782, that had been enacted in Rio de la Plata. Carbajal proposed the establishment of more Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo and Cebu, and although they were created on November 24, 1786, they were later abolished by the Royal Decree of November 20, 1787.Enciclopedia GER A month earlier, on October 23, the Intendencia of Manila had been attached to the Captaincy General of the Philippines.Biblioteca de legislaci√≥n ultramarina en forma de diccionario alfab√©tico.

It is a small essential piece of a job that serves as a means to differentiate various components of a project. A task can be broken down into assignments which should also have a defined start and end date or a deadline for completion. One or more assignments on a task puts the task under execution. Completion of all assignments on a specific task normally renders the task completed. Tasks can be linked together to create dependencies. Tasks completion generally requires the coordination of others. Coordinated human interaction takes on the role of combining the integration of time, energy, effort, ability, and resources of multiple individuals to meet a common goal. Coordination can also be thought of as the critical mechanism that links or ties together the efforts on the singular level to that of the larger task being completed by multiple members. Coordination allows for the successful completion of the otherwise larger tasks that one might encounter. In most projects, tasks may suffer one of two major drawbacks: * Task dependency: Which is normal as most tasks rely on others to get done. However, this can lead to the stagnation of a project when many tasks cannot get started unless others are finished. * Unclear understanding of the term complete: For example, if a task is 90% complete, does this mean that it will take only 1/9 of the time already spent on this task to finish it?

It was released as an arcade game in 2006, and was ported with the Guncon 3 light gun peripheral for PlayStation 3 in 2007. It features a new first-person shooter mode. It was later re-released as part of Time Crisis: Razing Storm with support for the PlayStation Move controller but without the first-person shooter mode. Plot The game opens in California, where intelligence officials from both the United States Armed Forces and the paramilitary V.S.S.E. organization learn about a top secret weapon targeted for terrorists' smuggling and their plot. William Rush infiltrates a pier to gather information, and learns that the enemy acquired the insect-like weapons called Terror Bite. After being told by Elizabeth Conway about an information leak incident at the airport, Rush goes to the airport to help VSSE agents Giorgio Bruno and Evan Bernard, who are assigned to stop the weapons trade. After leaving the airport, they defeat Marcus Black at the city. They discover U.S. Army dog tags on each enemy, meaning they are not just terrorists, but rogue American soldiers. The terrorist faction is then revealed to be the Biological Weapons Special Operations Unit (AKA the Hamlin Battalion). Rush, Giorgio and Evan fly to Wyoming's secluded bio-weapons research facility, but are too late to stop the supply of Terror Bites from being stolen. After defeating Jack Mathers, they soon learn that the Hamlin Battalion is attacking Buckley Air Force Base near Aurora, Colorado, prompting the men to invade the base. As Rush, Giorgio and Evan arrive, a number of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) depart the base without warning. Rush leads the Colorado National Guard toward an entrance, while Giorgio and Evan try to take care of the UCAVs. They also encounter V.S.S.E.'s old enemy Wild Dog in the base who, in addition to his standard hand gun, gatling gun and RPG, is now armed with a grappling hook and tractor beam device. After a long battle, Giorgio and Evan defeat him, ending with Wild Dog detonating himself once again. Meanwhile, Rush defeats Wild Fang (Wild Dog's younger partner from the previous game), sending him into the path of a UCAV as it lifts off. It is revealed that the Terror Bites' creator, Colonel Gregory Barrows hijacked the nuclear-armed UCAVs to destroy the United States in retaliation for the poor treatment he received from the military. After Giorgio and Evan defeat Barrows near the control center, Rush and his unit form a human pyramid to lift Giorgio and Evan into it to stop the missiles, where the agents press a big red button on the control computers to self-destruct all nuclear missiles that the UCAVs have already launched. Development The game was first shown at E3 2006 prior to its recent final revision arcade release. One major change is the addition of the multi-screen or multi-hiding system, introduced in Time Crisis: Project Titan. Unlike Project Titan, which players went on the offensive, players are placed on the defensive. In Project Titan, players had to hide and shoot arrows to switch screens. Screen switching has been refined to allow the player to merely point the gun outside the screen to move around. The game also utilizes a new light gun control with infrared emitters. Prior to this, all Namco light gun games used gun controllers that relied on cathode ray timing. Because Namco's light guns with cathode ray timing utilized memory chip-to-lens pointing, the arcade cabinet designers had to ensure that the infrared-emitting light gun controllers would provide the same accuracy as their cathode ray timing-based gun provided in the past. This delayed the game's release given past accuracy issues with IR light guns. The player can choose to customize gun calibration, and turn the blowback on or off with a pre-game code explained in the cabinet. The game, like its predecessors is available either in a 29\\" standard twin cabinet or a 52\\" deluxe twin. It also includes the multiple weapon system introduced in Time Crisis 3, with the pistol, machine gun, shotgun and grenade launcher, and also features new vehicle sections with similar gameplay mechanics to the Sega Arcade/Nintendo Wii shooters Gunblade NY and LA Machineguns. On several occasions, the player is equipped with a machine gun with infinite ammo or a sniper rifle used to shoot the tires on a marauding truck. Several other functions exclusive to the game includes a scene where the player must pull himself from quicksand, several scenes where a certain position must be defended, with the penalty of one life if the position is lost. On multiple occasions, Rush appears onscreen, whether caught in a trap or attacking an enemy as a diversion and care must be taken to avoid shooting him. It also features a voice navigation system that guides players through different situations. Given the voice navigation system, it can be voiced either in Japanese or English. Prior to the game, it was voiced exclusively in English. =PlayStation 3 release= The game was released for PlayStation 3 bundled with the GunCon 3 light gun peripheral,Antoine Morcos. \\"Time Crisis 4 sur PlayStation 3\\". Jeuxfrance.com. June 13, 2007. the edition features 480p (4:3) and 720p (16:9 widescreen) support and a specially-programmed first-person shooter mode, which players engage combat similar to a typical FPS game, but with manual gun pointing, aiming and firing in addition to arcade mode.Remo, Chris, Time Crisis 4 Review , Shack News, Nov 21st 2007, Accessed Mar 29, 2008 Players control William Rush for 5 levels, and as VSSE agents Giorgio Bruno or Evan Bernard for 10 levels through the game's \\"complete mission\\", complete with arcade footages when playing them. Much like its predecessors, it featured the Crisis Missions that has some backstories, starring star of Time Crisis characters from previous installments. The game was re-released for PlayStation 3 as part of Time Crisis: Razing Storm, released in October 2010, with support of the PlayStation Move controllers. Reception The game received mixed reviews, with an average GameRankings score of 60.70%, and a Metacritic score of 60 out of 100. GameSpot gave the game a 5.5 out of 10, while Jeff Haynes of IGN gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that it is \\"a fun game for any shooting fan looking to blast away with their PS3.\\" Matt Miller of Game Informer, however, was more critical of the game, giving it a score of 4.25 out of 10, criticizing its first-person shooter mode, \\"ludicrous plot\\", and shooting mechanic. GamePro rated Time Crisis 4 a positive score of 4 out of 5, saying the games plays just like the arcade, but replayability is an issue. X-Play also gave the game a score of 4 out of 5. One of the main key areas was the Guncon 3 controller included with the game. Chris Remo of Shacknews stated that it uses \\"two analog sticks for full movement and camera control, with pointer-based aiming on top\\" and that once \\"you get accustomed to it, this control actually works just fine, and feels like it could be the basis for its own game. \\" According to Miller, however, the controller \\"feels cheap,\\" with analog sticks that are \\"chintzy and hard to use\\"; referring to the left-hand subgrip which forces the main shooting handgrip to be held with the right hand, Miller claims that the Guncon 3 \\"hardly accommodates left-handed players.\\" Ryan Davis of GameSpot expressed that the complexity of the control scheme seems to contradict the pick-up-and-play mentality of the light gun genre.

The ballad tells the story of a person who visits a Gypsy fortune teller and is reassured that their partner is faithful. Though they both know it to be untrue, the narrator resolves to return, \\"'Cause I want to believe the Gypsy\\".  History  \\"The Gypsy\\" was originally introduced in the United Kingdom by Reid's orchestra and vocalist Dorothy Squires. In the United States, the song was recorded by Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, Dinah Shore, and Sammy Kaye's orchestra, and was a hit for all three. *The recording by The Ink Spots featuring Bill Kenny was released by Decca Records as catalog number 18817. It first reached the Billboard chart on May 2, 1946 and lasted 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at #1, and was also number one on the R&B; charts for three non-consecutive weeks. *The song was also recorded by Guy Lombardo featuring the female cabaret star Hildegarde singing. It was released by Decca Records as catalog number 23511 in March, 1946. This version was yet regarded as a musical flop. *The recording by Dinah Shore was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 36964. It first reached the Billboard charts on May 2, 1946 and lasted 15 weeks on the chart, peaking at #2. This recording was a two- sided hit, with the flip side, \\"Laughing on the Outside (Crying on the Inside),\\" reaching #3 the same year. *The recording by Sammy Kaye was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-1844. It first reached the Billboard chart on May 9, 1946 and lasted 10 weeks on the chart, peaking at #4.  Other recordings  The Gypsy was also recorded by Charlie Parker on July 29, 1946, during the famous \\"Lover Man\\" session after which he was committed to the Camarillo State Mental Hospital in California. Louis Armstrong recorded the song with the Commanders in October, 1953 and it was released on Decca Records as catalog number 28995. The song appears on Sonny Stitt Sits in with the Oscar Peterson Trio which was released in 1957. Sam Cooke recorded the song on his 1958 sophomore album Encore. Cooke was strongly influenced by The Ink Spots, and this was one of several songs previously performed by the group that he later covered. Quincy Jones recorded the song on his 1959 album The Birth of a Band!. Frank Sinatra recorded the song on his 1962 album Sinatra Sings Great Songs from Great Britain. A more recent version, by Memphis record producer and performer Jim Dickinson, was included in his 1997 release A Thousand Footsteps in the Sand, actually recorded in 1992. The Ink Spots' recording of the song appears on the soundtrack of the 2008 film Revolutionary Road.

It was begun in 1863 as an entry for a choral competition announced in Aachen. He chose as his text the dramatic poem of the same name by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, which presents an episode from the epic Jerusalem Delivered by Torquato Tasso in the form of a series of dialogues between the knight Rinaldo, who has been enchanted by the witch Armida, and his fellow knights, who are calling him back to the path of duty. The part of Armida is not sung as she makes only a silent appearance. Although the work was four-fifths completed in 1863, Brahms laid it aside and only finished it in 1868 after the success of his A German Requiem. The work is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, tenor solo, four-part men's chorus, and strings. A typical performance lasts between 36 and 40 minutes. The premiere took place in Vienna on 28 February 1869 at a concert of the Akademischer Gesangverein. The composer conducted, with the tenor Gustav Walter, a student chorus numbering 300, and the Court Opera orchestra. Rinaldo was subsequently published as Brahms‚Äô Op. 50. It has never been popular, but is interesting on a number of counts, not least because it may give the closest idea of what an opera by Brahms would have sounded like.

For example, the internal structure of an NPN bipolar transistor resembles two PN junction diodes connected together by a common anode. In normal operation the base-emitter junction does indeed form a diode, but in most cases it is undesirable for the base-collector junction to behave as a diode. If a sufficient forward bias is placed on this junction it will form a parasitic diode structure, and current will flow from base to collector. A common parasitic structure is that of an SCR. Once triggered, an SCR conducts for as long as there is a current, necessitating a complete power-down to reset the behavior of the device. This condition is known as latchup.

Gustav Uwe Jenner (3 December 1865 - 29 August 1920) was a German composer, conductor and musical scholar. He was the only formal composition pupil of Johannes Brahms. Jenner was born in Keitum on the island of Sylt. His father, a doctor, came from a Scottish family: he claimed descent from Edward Jenner, the discoverer of smallpox vaccine, and was related to the family who built the eponymous Art-Nouveau style department store which is one of the landmarks of Edinburgh's Princes Street. While at school in Kiel, Jenner started to teach himself to write music but, after his father committed suicide in 1884 (he had been accused of abusing female patients), he was befriended and assisted by the poet Klaus Groth, who arranged for him to study with Brahms's old teacher Eduard Marxsen in Hamburg. Marxsen in his turn handed Jenner over to Brahms, with whom he studied in Vienna from February 1888 to 1895, also receiving instruction from Eusebius Mandyczewski. Though Brahms was a merciless critic of Jenner's compositional attempts, he took great care over his welfare. He had him appointed Secretary of the Vienna Tonk√ºnstlerverein and in 1895 arranged for him to become Musical Director and conductor at the University of Marburg, where he spent the rest of his career despite invitations to assume more prestigious posts in Breslau and Berlin. It was in Marburg that he died. As a composer Jenner concentrated on chamber music (three string quartets, a piano quartet, a trio for clarinet, horn and piano, three violin sonatas, a cello sonata and other works), choral pieces and songs. Though his music is highly conservative for his time and shows a strong Brahmsian imprint, he was capable of individual expression and his works are always finely wrought. Other than his works for voice, few of these works were published in his lifetime. His String Quartet No. 3 in F major has been published by Schott Music and his Piano Quartet in F major has been published by Edition Silvertrust. There is also a Serenade in A major for orchestra (1911‚Äì12), Jenner‚Äôs only orchestral work. Jenner published two volumes of recollections of Brahms, Brahms als Mensch, Lehrer und K√ºnstler' ' (Brahms as Man, Teacher and Artist) (Marburg, 1905) which, viewing Brahms from a unique vantage point, are a valuable biographical source.

Khanewal is named after the earliest settlers here who belonged to the caste ‚ÄòDaha‚Äô (A Sub-Caste of Panwar Rajput) and used ‚ÄòKhan‚Äô in their names. That is how the city came to be known as ‚Äòkhan-e-wal‚Äô. History Khanewal is home to a sizable Christian minority Khanewal has a rich and vibrant history which can be traced back to the early 1900s. Khanewal is famous for its cotton growing industry. Dahas are regarded as the initial settlers and founders of Khanewal. Khagga, Haraj, Daha, Bodla, Siyal are the largest castes of Khanewal. Historically Khanewal is an old city having its earliest foundations laid by the British Empire owing to its importance as a railway junction. The city was a junction of the Wazirabad-Khanewal railway line and provided a connection to the city of Karachi via Lahore. Its straight roads show that it is a well planned town by the British people. The land where Khanewal is currently situated was barren originally and was called Gunji Bar or Kabirwala Bar. Bar is a geographical term used to describe elevated land on sides of rivers. Initially this area used to be Southern shore of river Ravi. At that time Ravi used to flow from East to West of Multan city. With the passage of time, the river kept changing its flow, the river soil turned this piece of land into a vegetated land. With ample trees in the area, a tribe called the Khan Daha tribe moved to this place in 1700s. This area was populated by Khan Zayadat Khan Daha, the forefather of Daha family. It is said that he was originally from Darwar State Central India but then migrated to Bahawalpur. After trying his luck in Bahawalpur, he moved to Pak-Pattan. Then in 1820s, he moved to this region after getting employment under Dewan Sawan Mall. As an employee, he was made responsible for collection and payments from Tulamba, Tiba Sultan Pur, Kot Kamalia and Luddan. He got famous in the region as Khan and thus this area was named Khan-e-wala. Singhar Khan Daha was the 34th descendant of Tikkey Khan Daha, the first Muslim in Daha family and accepted Islam on the hands of Hazrat Bahauddin Zakariya (R.A). Singhar Khan Daha is said to have moved to Khanewal from Pak-Pattan in 1700. It is said that he built a castle in the area. The family lived here for long and Hassan Khan Daha, 37th descendent of Tikkey Khan Daha, became one of the most prominent businessmen of the region. Hassan Khan Daha was awarded Sanad from Pathan Governments in 1768. Till now Dahas are the rulers of Khanewal and till now are a part of Local, Provincial and National Governments.

Kurds are the largest ethnic minority in Syria, constituting around 10 per cent of the population - around 2 million of the pre-conflict population of around 22 million. Various proportions are predicted for Kurds. For example McDowall[8] and O‚Äôshea[9] predict 8%, Bruinessen predicts 8.5%,[10] Chailand predicts 10%[11]. Vanly, Kurdish writer, stated that Kurds must be at least 7% of Syrian population In 2019, the New York Times estimated the proportion of Kurds in Syria between 5 and 10%.

Human rights organizations have accused the Syrian government of routinely discriminating and harassing Syrian Kurds. Many Kurds seek political autonomy for what they regard as Western Kurdistan, similar to the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq, or outright independence as part of Kurdistan. In the context of the Syrian Civil War, Kurds established the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.

The majority of Syrian Kurds speak Kurmanji, a Kurdish dialect spoken in Turkey and northeastern Iraq and Iran. The distribution of Syria's Kurds has been estimated at 40% in the Jazira Region, 30% in the Afrin District, 10% in the Euphrates Region, 10% in Aleppo City (thus 40% of Syrian Kurds live in Aleppo Governorate, which includes Aleppo and Afrin), and 10% for the rest of Syria, mostly in Damascus.http://sahipkiran.org/2014/08/05/kurdish-population-in-syria/ It is estimated that at the beginning of the 20th century around 12,000 Kurds lived in Damascus; an unknown number of Kurds lived in the Kurd-Dagh region; 16,000 Kurds lived in the Jarabulus region; and an unknown number lived in the Jazira province, where they were likely the majority. In the 1920s after the failed Kurdish rebellions in Kemalist Turkey, there was a large migration of Kurds to Syria's Jazira province. It is estimated that 25,000 Kurds fled at this time to Syria. According to Stefan Sperl, these Kurdish newcomers constituted no more than 10% of the Kurdish population of Jazira at the time. All were granted citizenship by the French mandate authorities, who recognized their agricultural skills. However, the French official reports show the existence of at most 45 Kurdish villages in Jazira prior to 1927. A new wave of refugees arrived in 1929. The mandatory authorities continued to encourage Kurdish immigration into Syria, and by 1939, the villages numbered between 700 and 800. Sperl's estimation contradicts the estimates of the French geographers Fevret and Gibert, who estimated that in 1953 out of the total 146,000 inhabitants of Jazira, agriculturalist Kurds made up 60,000 (41%), nomad Arabs 50,000 (34%), and a quarter of the population were Christians. Even though Kurds have a long history in Syria, the government has used the fact that many Kurds fled to Syria during the 1920s to claim that Kurds are not indigenous to the country and to justify its discriminatory policies against them. Many Arabic-speaking Kurds are classified as Arabs by the Arab nationalist Syrian government.https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/rojavas- sustainability-and-the-pkks-regional-strategy Geography Many Kurds live in the large cities and metropolitan areas of the country, for example, in the neighborhood of Rukn al-Din in Damascus which was formerly known as Hayy al Akrad (Kurdish Quarter), and the Aleppo neighbourhood of Sheikh Maqsood.modersmal.skolutveckling.se History =Early settlements= The Crusader fortress of 225px Kurdish settlement in Syria goes back to before the Crusades of the 11th century. Kurdish military and feudal settlements from before this period have been found in the Alawite and north Lebanese mountains and around Hama and its surroundings. The Crusader fortress of Krak des Chevaliers, known in Arabic as Hisn al-Akrad (Castle of the Kurds), was originally a Kurdish military settlement before it was enlarged by French Crusaders. Similarly, the Kurd-Dagh has been inhabited by Kurds for more than a millennium. =Ayyubid period= In the 12th century, Kurdish and other Muslim regiments accompanied Saladin, who was a Kurd from Tikrit, on his conquest of the Middle East and establishment of the Ayyubid dynasty (1171‚Äì1341), which was administered from Damascus. The Kurdish regiments that accompanied Salidin established self-ruled areas in and around Damascus. These settlements evolved into the Kurdish sections of Damascus of Hayy al-Akrad (the Kurdish quarter) and the Salhiyya districts located in the north-east of Damasacus on Mount Qasioun. The Kurdish community's role in the military continued under the Ottomans. Kurdish soldiers and policeman from the city were tasked with both maintaining order and protecting the pilgrims‚Äô route toward Mecca. Many Kurds from Syria's rural hinterland joined the local Janissary corp in Damascus. Later, Kurdish migrants from diverse areas, such as Diyarbakir, Mosul and Kirkuk, also joined these military units which caused an expansion of the Kurdish community in the city. =Ottoman period= Sabat Islambooly (Kurdish Jew from Syria) ‚Äì October 10, 1885 During the Ottoman period (1516‚Äì1922), some large Kurdish tribal groups both settled in and were deported to areas of northern Syria from Anatolia. The largest of these tribal groups was the Reshwan confederation, which was initially based in the Adiyaman region but eventually also settled throughout Anatolia. The Milli confederation, which was documented in Ottoman sources from the year 1518 onward, was the most powerful tribal group and dominated the entire northern Syrian steppe in the second half of the 18th century. The Kurdish dynasty of Janbulads ruled the region of Aleppo as governors for the Ottomans from 1591 to 1607 and its most notable member, Ali Janbulad, allied with the Medici of Tuscany. At the beginning of the 17th century, districts of Jarabulus and Seruj on the left bank of the Euphrates were settled by Kurds. In the mid-18th century, Ottomans recognized Milli tribal leaders as iskan ba≈üi or chief of sedentarization in Raqqa area. They were given taxing authority and controlling other tribes in the region. In 1758, Milli chief and iskan ba≈üi Mahmud bin Kalash entered Khabur valley, subjugated the local tribes and brought the area under control of Milli confederation and attempted to set up an independent principality. In 1800, the Ottoman government appointed the Milli chief Timur as governor of Raqqa (1800‚Äì1803). The Danish writer Carsten Niebuhr, who traveled to Jazira in 1764, recorded five nomadic Kurdish tribes (Dukurie, Kikie, Schechchanie, Mullie and Aschetie) and six Arab tribes (Tay, Kaab, Baggara, Geheish, Diabat and Sherabeh). According to Niebuhr, the Kurdish tribes were settled near Mardin in Turkey, and paid the governor of that city for the right of grazing their herds in the Syrian Jazira. These Kurdish tribes gradually settled in villages and cities and are still present in Jazira (modern Syria's Hasakah Governorate). The demographics of this area underwent a huge shift in the early part of the 20th century. Ottoman authorities with the cooperation of Kurdish troops (and to a lesser degree, Circassian and Chechen tribes) persecuted Armenian and Assyrian Christians in Upper Mesopotamia and were granted their victims' land as a reward. Kurds were responsible for most of the atrocities against Assyrians, and Kurdish expansion happened at the expense of Assyrians (due to factors like proximity). Kurdish as well as Circassian and Chechen tribes cooperated with the Ottoman (Turkish) authorities in the massacres of Armenian and Assyrian Christians in Upper Mesopotamia, between 1914 and 1920, with further attacks on unarmed fleeing civilians conducted by local Arab militias.Travis, Hannibal.

The town was destroyed and the Christian population, about 300 families, fled to the towns of Qamishli and Hasakah.John Joseph, Muslim-Christian Relations and Inter-Christian Rivalries in the Middle East, p. 107. In other parts of the country during this period, Kurds became local chiefs and tax farmers in Akkar (Lebanon) and the Qusayr highlands between Antioch and Latakia in northwestern Syria. The Afrin Plateau northwest of Aleppo, just inside what is today Syria, was officially known as the \\"Sancak of the Kurds\\" in Ottoman documents. The Millis revolted against the Ottoman government after the death of their leader Ibrahim Pasa and some of them eventually settled for the most part on the Syrian side of the newly drawn Turkish-Syrian border of 1922. The immigration of some Kurds to Syria began in 1926 following the failure of the rebellion of Saed Ali Naqshbandi against the Turkish authorities.Abu Fakhr, Saqr, 2013.

Displacement and Dispossession in the Modern Middle East. Cambridge University Press. pp. 230-232. During the great war, Kurdish tribes attacked and sacked and villages in Albaq District immediately to the north of Hakkari mountains. According to Lieutenant Ronald Sempill Stafford, large numbers of Assyrians and Armenians were killed. =French Mandate= Following World War I, the victorious Allied powers and the defeated Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of S√®vres of 10 August 1920. The treaty stipulated that Ottoman Kurdistan, which included Kurdish inhabited areas in present Syria, was to be given autonomy within the new Turkish Republic, with the choice for full independence within a year. The Kemalist victory in Turkey and subsequent territorial gains during the Turkish War of Independence led to the renegotiated Treaty of Lausanne of 24 July 1923, which made no mention of a future Kurdish state. The majority of Ottoman Kurdish territory was given to Turkey and the rest was divided between the newly established French Mandate of Syria and British Mandate of Iraq. Provisions of the Treaty of S√®vres for an independent Kurdistan (in 1920). Provisions of the Treaty of S√®vres Kurdish immigration waves to Syria's Jazira province started in the 1920s, especially following the failure of the Sheikh Said rebellion against the Turkish authorities and in subsequent years. The number of Kurds settled in the Jazira province during the 1920s was estimated at 20,000 people. Sir John Hope Simpson has reported that the Jazira province had 100,000 inhabitants, among which 20,000 were Kurds. Under the French Mandate of Syria, newly-arriving Kurds were granted citizenship by French Mandate authorities and enjoyed considerable rights as the French Mandate authority encouraged minority autonomy as part of a divide and rule strategy and recruited heavily from the Kurds and other minority groups, such as Alawite and Druze, for its local armed forces. Early demands for a Kurdish autonomy came from the Kurdish deputy Nuri Kandy of Kurd Dagh, who asked the authorities of the French mandate to grant an administrative autonomy to all the areas with a Kurdish majority in 1924. Also the Kurdish tribes of the Barazi Confederation demanded autonomy for the Kurdish regions within the French Mandate.Tejel, pp.27‚Äì28 But their requests were not fulfilled by the French at the time.Tejel, p.28 Between December 1931 and January 1932, the first elections under the new Syrian constitution were held.The 1930 Constitution is integrally reproduced in: Among the deputies there were three members of the Syrian Kurdish nationalist Xoyb√ªn (Khoyboun) party from the three different Kurdish enclaves in Syria: Khalil bey Ibn Ibrahim Pacha (Jazira province), Mustafa bey Ibn Shahin (Jarabulus) and Hassan Aouni (Kurd Dagh). In the mid-1930s, there arose a new autonomist movement in the Jazira province among Kurds and Christians. The Kurdish leaders Hajo Agha, Kaddur Bey, and Khalil Bey Ibrahim Pasha. Hajo Agha was the Kurdish chief of the Heverkan tribal confederation and one of the leaders of the Kurdish nationalist party Xoyb√ªn (Khoyboun). He established himself as the representative of the Kurds in Jazira maintaining the coalition with the Christian notables, who were represented by the Syriac Catholic Patriarch Ignatius Gabriel I Tappouni and Michel D√¥me the Armenian Catholic president of the Qamishli municipality. The Kurdish-Christian Coalition wanted French troops to stay in the province in case of Syrian independence, as they feared the nationalist Damascus government would replace minority officials by Muslim Arabs from the capital. The French authorities, although some in their ranks had earlier encouraged this anti-Damascus movement, refused to consider any new status of autonomy inside Syria and even annexed the Alawite State and the Jabal Druze State to the Syrian Republic.Jordi Tejel Gorgas, \\"Les territoires de marge de la Syrie mandataire : le mouvement autonomiste de la Haute Jaz√Æra, paradoxes et ambigu√Øt√©s d‚Äôune int√©gration\\" nationale\\" inachev√©e (1936-1939)\\" (The territory margins of the Mandatory Syria : the autonomist movement in Upper Jaz√Æra, paradoxs and ambiguities of an uncompleted \\"national\\" integration, 1936-39), Revue des mondes musulmans et de la M√©diterran√©e, 126, November 2009, p. 205-222 In 1936, there French forces Bombarded Amuda. On 13 August 1937, in a revenge attack, Kurdish tribes sided with Damascus and about 500 men from the Dakkuri, Milan, and Kiki tribes led by the Kurdish tribal leader Sa'ed Agha al-Dakkuri attacked the then predominantly Christian Amuda and burned the town. The town was destroyed and the Christian population, about 300 families, fled to the towns of Qamishli and Hasakah. = Syrian independence = Osman Sabri and Hamza Diweran along with some Kurdish politicians, founded the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria (KDPS) in 1957. The objectives of KDPS were promotion of Kurdish cultural rights, economic progress and democratic change. Following their demands for the recognition of the Kurdish cultural rights, the Party got suppressed by the United Arab Republic and the possession of Kurdish publications or music was enough to be sent to be detained. KDPS was never legally recognized by the Syrian state and remains an underground organization, especially after a crackdown in 1960 during which several of its leaders were arrested, charged with separatism and imprisoned. After the failure of Syrian political union with Egypt in 1961, Syria was declared an Arab Republic in the interim constitution. = Syrian Arab Republic =  Jazira census  On 23 August 1962, the government conducted a special population census only for the province of Jazira, which was predominantly Kurdish. As a result, around 120,000 Kurds in Jazira (20% of Syrian Kurds) were stripped of their Syrian citizenship even though they were in possession of Syrian identity cards. The inhabitants who had Syrian identity cards were told to hand them over to the administration for renewal. However, many of those Kurds who submitted their cards received nothing in return. Many were arbitrarily categorized as ajanib ('foreigners'), while others who did not participate in the census were categorized as maktumin ('unregistered'), an even lower status than the ajanib; for all intents and purposes, these unregistered Kurds did not exist in the eyes of the state. They could not get jobs, become educated, own property, participate in politics, or even get married. In some cases, classifications varied even within Kurdish families: parents had citizenship but not their children, a child could be a citizen but not his or her brothers and sisters. Those Kurds who lost their citizenship were often dispossessed of their lands, which were given by the state to Arab and Assyrian settlers.Tejel, p. 51 A media campaign was launched against the Kurds with slogans such as Save Arabism in Jazira! and Fight the Kurdish Menace!.Tejel, p. 52 These policies in the Jazira region coincided with the beginning of Barzani's uprising in Iraqi Kurdistan and discovery of oilfields in the Kurdish inhabited areas of Syria. In June 1963, Syria took part in the Iraqi military campaign against the Kurds by providing aircraft, armoured vehicles and a force of 6,000 soldiers. Syrian troops crossed the Iraqi border and moved into Kurdish town of Zakho in pursuit of Barzani's fightersI. C.

Sperl, Chapter 8, Routledge, 1992, , pp.151‚Äì52  Arab cordon  Syrian policies in the 1970s led to Arabs resettling in majority Kurdish areas. In 1965, the Syrian government decided to create an Arab cordon (Hizam Arabi) in the Jazira region along the Turkish border. The cordon was along the Turkish-Syrian border and 10‚Äì15 kilometers wide, stretched from the Iraqi border in the east to Ras Al- Ain in the west. The implementation of the Arab cordon plan began in 1973 and Bedouin Arabs were brought in and resettled in Kurdish areas. The toponymy of the area such as village names were Arabized. According to the original plan, some 140,000 Kurds had to be deported to the southern desert near Al-Raad. Although Kurdish farmers were dispossessed of their lands, they refused to move and give up their houses. Among these Kurdish villagers, those who were designated as alien were not allowed to own property, to repair a crumbling house or to build a new one.I. C.

Sperl, Chapter 8, Routledge, 1992, , pp.157, 158, 161 In 1976 the further implementation of the arabization policy along the Turkish border was officially dropped by Hafez al Assad. The achieved demographic changes were not reverted, and in 1977 a ban on non-arabic place names was issued.  Newroz protests  In March 1986, a few thousand Kurds wearing Kurdish costume gathered in the Kurdish part of Damascus to celebrate the spring festival of Newroz. Police warned them that Kurdish dress was prohibited and they fired on the crowd leaving one person dead. Around 40,000 Kurds took part in his funeral in Qamishli. Also in Afrin, three Kurds were killed during the Newroz demonstrations.I. C. Vanly, The Kurds in Syria and Lebanon, In The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview, Edited by P.G. Kreyenbroek, S. Sperl, Chapter 8, Routledge, 1992, , pp.163-164 After the protests, the Syrian government prohibited the Newroz festivities and established a new holiday on the same day, honoring the mothers.  Qamishli riots  The flag of Kurdistan is banned in Syria, but it has begun to be flown during the Syrian uprising and civil war. After an incident in a football stadium in Qamishli, 65 people were killed and more than 160 were injured in days of clashes starting from 12 March. Kurdish sources indicated that Syrian security forces used live ammunition against civilians after clashes broke out at a football match between Kurdish fans of the local team and Arab supporters of a visiting team from the city of Deir al-Zor. The international press reported that nine people were killed on 12 March. According to Amnesty International hundreds of people, mostly Kurds, were arrested after the riots. Kurdish detainees were reportedly tortured and ill-treated. Some Kurdish students were expelled from their universities, reportedly for participating in peaceful protests.Syria: Address Grievances Underlying Kurdish Unrest, HRW, 19 March 2004.  KNAS (Kurdnas) formation  The Kurdistan National Assembly of Syria was formed to represent Syrian Kurds based on two major conferences, one at the US Senate in March 2006 and the other at the EU parliament in Brussels in 2006. The Kurdistan National Assembly of Syria (KNAS) seeks democracy for Syria and supports granting equal rights to Kurds and other Syrian minorities. They seek to transform Syria into a federal state, with a democratic system and structure for the federal government and provincial governments. = Syrian Civil War = Ser√™ Kaniy√™ (Ra's al-'Ayn) pictured above and a series of other towns in the Kurdish inhabited northeast of Syria were captured by the People's Protection Units (YPG). Following the Tunisian Revolution and the Egyptian Revolution, 4 February 2011 was declared a Day of Rage in Syria by activists through Facebook. Few turned out to protest, but among the few were Kurdish demonstrators in the northeast of the country. On 7 October 2011, Kurdish leader Mashaal Tammo was gunned down in his apartment by masked men widely believed to be government agents.

Kurdish rebellion  YPG's female units were fighting against ISIS in Syria Protests in the Kurdish inhabited areas of Syria evolved into armed clashes after the opposition Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and Kurdish National Council (KNC) signed a cooperation agreement on 12 July 2012 that created the Kurdish Supreme Committee as the governing body of all Kurdish controlled areas. Under the administration of the Kurdish Supreme Committee, the People's Protection Units (YPG) were created to control the Kurdish inhabited areas in Syria. On 19 July, the YPG captured the city of Koban√™, and the next day captured Am√ªd√™ and Efr√Æn. The KNC and PYD afterwards formed a joint leadership council to run the captured cities.

The Kurds often speak the Kurdish language in public, unless all those present do not. According to the Human Rights Watch, Kurds in Syria are not allowed to officially use the Kurdish language, are not allowed to register children with Kurdish names, are prohibited to start businesses that do not have Arabic names, are not permitted to build Kurdish private schools and are prohibited from publishing books and other materials written in Kurdish. In 1988 it was prohibited also to sing in non-arabic language at weddings or festivities. But this is no longer enforced due to the civil war. There are also some \\"nawar people\\" (gypsies) who speak Kurdish and call themselves Kurds in some regions.  Decree 768  The decree 768 of the year 2000, prohibited shops to sell cassettes or videos in Kurdish language. The decree also encouraged to implement older restrictions of the Kurdish language. = Citizenship = In 1962, 20 percent of Syria's Kurdish population were stripped of their Syrian citizenship following a very highly controversial census raising concerns among human rights groups. According to the Syrian government, the reason for this enactment was due to groups of Kurds infiltrating the Al-Hasakah Governorate in 1945. The Syrian government claims that the Kurds came from neighboring countries, especially Turkey, and crossed the Syrian border illegally. The government claims that these Kurds settled down, gradually, in the region in cities like Amuda and Qamishli until they accounted for the majority in some of these cities. The government also claims that many Kurds were capable of registering themselves illegally in the Syrian civil registers. The government further speculated that Kurds intended to settle down and acquire property, especially after the issue of the agricultural reform law, in order to benefit from land redistribution. However, according to Human Rights Watch, the Syrian government falsely claimed that many of the Kurds who were the original inhabitants of the land were foreigners, and in turn, violated their human rights by stripping them of their Syrian citizenship. The flag of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria As a result of government claims of an increase in illegal immigration, the Syrian government decided to conduct a general census on 5 October 1962 in the governorate with claims that its sole purpose was to purify registers and eliminate the alien infiltrators. As a result, the verified registrations of the citizens of Syria were included in the new civil registers. The remaining, which included 100,000 Kurds, were registered as foreigners (or \\"ajanib\\") in special registers. Many others did not participate in the census through choice or other circumstances; they are known as \\"maktoumeen\\", meaning \\"unrecorded\\". Since then, the number of stateless Kurds has grown to more than 200,000.voanews.com According to Refugees International, there are about 300,000 Kurdish non-citizens in Syria; however, Kurds dispute this number and estimate about 500,000. An independent report has confirmed that there are at least 300,000 non-citizen Kurds living in Syria. According to the Human Rights Watch, by many accounts, the special census was carried out in an arbitrary manner separating members of the same families and classifying them differently. HRW claims that some Kurds in the same family became citizens while others became foreigners suggesting an inaccuracy in the Syrian government's process; HRW also alleges that some of the Kurds who had served in the Syrian army lost citizenship while those who bribed officials kept theirs. Stateless Kurds also do not have the option of legally relocating to another country because they lack passports or other internationally recognized travel documents. In Syria, other than in the governorate of Al- Hasakah, foreigners cannot be employed at government agencies and state-owned enterprises; they may not legally marry Syrian citizens. Kurds with foreigner status do not have the right to vote in elections or run for public office, and when they attend universities they are often persecuted and cannot be awarded with university degrees. non-citizens Kurds living in Syria are not awarded school certificates and are often unable to travel outside of their provinces. In April 2011, the President signed Decree 49 which provides citizenship for Kurds who were registered as foreigners in Hasaka.Legislative Decree on Granting Syrian Nationality to People Registered in Registers of Hasaka Foreigners , SANA, 8 April 2011 However, a recent independent report has suggested that the actual number of non-citizens Kurds who obtained their national ID cards following the decree does not exceed 6,000, leaving the remainder of 300,000 non-citizens Kurds living in Syria in a state of uncertainty. One newly nationalized Kurd has been reported as saying: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm pleased to have my ID card .... But not until the process is completed will I truly trust the intentions of this action. Before my card is activated, I must have an interview, no doubt full of interrogation and intimidation, with State Security. Citizenship should not be a privilege.

He was tall. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Meszaros was a television and film actor, and he also appeared opposite pop singer Michael Jackson in a Pepsi commercial. His last appearance was in 2015's Death to Cupid. For the first season of the ALF television series, Meszaros donned a costume whenever a full-body shot was needed for scenes of the alien walking, running, or standing. For the most part, however, upper-body shots of a mechanical puppet were used instead, since the full-body costume was extremely hot and uncomfortable for the actor to wear for long periods of time under bright studio lights. The ALF puppet and costume can be distinguished on first view because the head proportions are slightly different. Biography Meszaros also was a member of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus as the former \\"smallest man in the world\\". As a youngster, he attended a state-run school of circus arts, becoming well versed in such performing skills as juggling, acrobatics and pantomime. For many years, American circus producers Irvin Feld and Kenneth Feld had heard of the existence, somewhere in Hungary, of a man almost too small to believe. The producers finally located him in 1973; astonished at his size and talents, they made immediate arrangements to bring Meszaros from the small Hungarian circus to the United States. As a circus performer, he trained and presented white standard poodles for his act. Standing on their hind legs, the dogs appeared much taller than their diminutive but commanding trainer. Circus audiences nationwide cheered his dignified though slightly comedic role, in which he was billed as the \\"Smallest Man in the World\\". In the so-called Grand Spectacle performance of 1982 and 1983, Meszaros would portray a character known as the Marshal of Marshmallow Gulch, resplendent in a well-tailored white, silver and gold costume encrusted with rhinestones, along with matching cowboy hat and silver boots. In the 1980s Hawthorne, California, where he resided, named the shortest street in that city \\"Michu Lane\\" in his honor. On June 12, 2016, his manager Dennis Varga announced that Meszaros was in a comatose state in a Los Angeles hospital, after Varga discovered him unconscious on his bathroom floor. He had suffered numerous health issues since a stroke eight years earlier. He died at the Providence Little Company of Mary medical center in Torrance the following night.

These three camps were created by the UN in Kosovo. The camps are based around disused heavy metals mines which have fallen out of use since the end of the Kosovo War of 1999. There have been complaints that the residents are suffering severe lead poisoning. According to a 2010 Human Rights Watch, Romani displaced from the Romani quarter in Mitrovica, due to its destruction in 2000, continued to be inmates of camps in north Mitrovica (Cesmin Lug, Osterode and Leposavic), where they were exposed to environmental lead poisoning. Current situation A number of people have been resettled to the local mahala and to the former French UN barracks. The current situation is that approximately 150 Romani, Ashkali and Egyptian families live in the camps of North Mitrovica. There are plans to resettle the majority of these families to the Romani Mahala neighbourhood in the main part of the city (across the Rivar Ibar), where 100 families already reside. The community is receiving assistance from a number of local and international NGOs. The former French barracks, Osterode camp, is managed by a local NGO Kosovo Agency for Advocacy and Development (KAAD) - funded by the Kosovo Ministry for Communities and Returns, while the nearby Cesmin Lug camp, where living conditions are noticeably poorer, is officially under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in Mitrovic√´/a. Unemployment is extremely high in the community of relocation, Romani Mahala and Mitrovica more generally. There was a commitment to close the camps by the end of 2010 but this goal may be overambitious, especially as Western European countries continue to forcibly return RAE people to Kosovo despite the obvious lack of absorptive capacity in the receiving society. Background A BBC article of June 2005 said that the European Roma Rights Centre was preparing legal action against the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the interim Kosovan Government over its failure to relocate the remaining residents. Response An article was written by Paul Polansky in the New York Times regarding the state of the camp inmates, in April, 2005. Subsequently, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Amnesty International, the Society for Threatened Peoples, Refugees International and many other humanitarian organizations have been demanding that the UN immediately evacuate these three camps. Legal actions have been taken by the European Roma Rights Centre. On 20 February 2006, ERRC filed a lawsuit against UNMIK with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. On 24 March 2006, a meeting was held by the United Nations Human Rights Committee to review the ERRC's report on the human rights situation in Mitrovica. In 2006, it was reported that new sites were being found for the Romani refugees, however the suitability of the sites, i.e. their location in Albanian areas, and the progress towards relocation of the inmates was not available to the report. According to UNMIK, smelting of lead by camp inhabitants has contributed to their exposure to lead poisoning, Chachipe, a Romani rights advocacy organization, has debated this contention of UNMIK as a ploy to draw attention away from the real sources of lead contamination, the heaps of soil behind the Cesmin Lug and Osterode camps. Documentaries A documentary about the issue, Gypsy Blood: The Roma, Ashali and Egyptian IDPs of Kosovska Mitrovica, Kosovo was completed in July 2005 by American film-maker Daniel Lanctot. This documentary was screened at numerous international venues. It won the award for Best Informative Film at the Golden Wheel Film Festival (2005) in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.

It resulted in the Russian government and the Russian Central Bank devaluing the ruble and defaulting on its debt. The crisis had severe impacts on the economies of many neighboring countries. Meanwhile, James Cook, the senior vice president of The U.S. Russia Investment Fund, suggested the crisis had the positive effect of teaching Russian banks to diversify their assets. Background and course of events Declining productivity, a high fixed exchange rate between the ruble and foreign currencies to avoid public turmoil, and a chronic fiscal deficit were the reasons that led to the crisis. The economic cost of the first war in Chechnya, estimated at $5.5 billion (not including the rebuilding of the ruined Chechen economy), also contributed to the crisis. In the first half of 1997, the Russian economy showed some signs of improvement. However, soon after this, the problems began to gradually intensify. Two external shocks, the Asian financial crisis that had begun in 1997 and the following declines in demand for (and thus price of) crude oil and nonferrous metals, severely impacted Russian foreign exchange reserves.Russian Federation: International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, IMF, 25 June 2012 A political crisis came to a head in March when Russian president Boris Yeltsin suddenly dismissed Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his entire cabinet on 23 March 1998. Yeltsin named Energy Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, then 35 years old, as acting prime minister. On 29 May 1998, Yeltsin appointed Boris Fyodorov as Head of the State Tax Service. In an effort to prop up the currency and stem the flight of capital, in June 1998 Kiriyenko hiked GKO interest rates to 150%. A $22.6 billion International Monetary Fund and World Bank financial package was approved on 13 July 1998 to support reforms and stabilize the Russian market by swapping out an enormous volume of the quickly maturing GKO short-term bills into long-term Eurobonds. The Russian government decided to keep the exchange rate of the ruble within a narrow band, although many economists, including Andrei Illarionov, urged the government to abandon its support of the ruble. On 12 May 1998, coal miners went on strike over unpaid wages, blocking the Trans-Siberian Railway. By 1 August 1998 there was approximately $12.5 billion in debt owed to Russian workers. On 14 August 1998 the exchange rate of the Russian ruble to the US dollar was still 6.29. Despite the bailout, July 1998 monthly interest payments on Russia's debt rose to a figure 40 percent higher than its monthly tax collections. Additionally, on 15 July 1998, the State Duma dominated by left-wing parties refused to adopt most of the government anti-crisis plan so that the government was forced to rely on presidential decrees. On 29 July Yeltsin interrupted his vacation in Valdai Hills region and flew to Moscow, prompting fears of a Cabinet reshuffle, but he only replaced Federal Security Service Chief Nikolay Kovalyov with Vladimir Putin. At the time, Russia employed a \\"floating peg\\" policy toward the ruble, meaning that the Central Bank decided that at any given time the ruble-to-dollar (or RUB/USD) exchange rate would stay within a particular range. If the ruble threatened to devalue outside of that range (or \\"band\\"), the Central Bank would intervene by spending foreign reserves to buy rubles. For instance, during the year before the crisis, the Central Bank aimed to maintain a band of 5.3 to 7.1 RUB/USD, meaning that it would buy rubles if the market exchange rate threatened to exceed 7.1 rubles/dollar. Similarly, it would sell rubles if the market exchange rate threatened to drop below 5.3. The inability of the Russian government to implement a coherent set of economic reforms led to a severe erosion in investor confidence and a chain reaction that can be likened to a run on the Central Bank. Investors fled the market by selling rubles and Russian assets (such as securities), which also put downward pressure on the ruble. This forced the Central Bank to spend its foreign reserves to defend Russia's currency, which in turn further eroded investor confidence and undermined the ruble. It is estimated that between 1 October 1997 and 17 August 1998, the Central Bank expended approximately $27 billion of its U.S. dollar reserves to maintain the floating peg. It was later revealed that about $5 billion of the international loans provided by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund were stolen upon the funds' arrival in Russia on the eve of the meltdown.. Crisis and effects On 17 August 1998, the Russian government devalued the ruble, defaulted on domestic debt, and declared a moratorium on repayment of foreign debt.. On that day the Russian government and the Central Bank of Russia issued a \\"Joint Statement\\" announcing, in essence, that: # the ruble/dollar trading band would expand from 5.3‚Äì7.1 RUB/USD to 6.0‚Äì9.5 RUB/USD; # Russia's ruble-denominated debt would be restructured in a manner to be announced at a later date; and, to prevent mass Russian bank default, # a temporary 90-day moratorium would be imposed on the payment of some bank obligations, including certain debts and forward currency contracts. On 17 August 1998 the government declared that certain state securities (GKOs and OFZs) would be transformed into new securities. At the same time, in addition to widening the currency band, authorities also announced that they intended to allow the RUB/USD rate to move more freely within the wider band. At the time, the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (or \\"MICEX\\") set a daily \\"official\\" exchange rate through a series of interactive auctions based on written bids submitted by buyers and sellers. When the buy and sell prices matched, this \\"fixed\\" or \\"settled\\" the official MICEX exchange rate, which would then be published by Reuters. The MICEX rate was (and is) commonly used by banks and currency dealers worldwide as the reference exchange rate for transactions involving the Russian ruble and foreign currencies. From 17 to 25 August 1998, the ruble steadily depreciated on the MICEX, moving from 6.43 to 7.86 RUB/USD. On 26 August 1998, the Central Bank terminated dollar-ruble trading on the MICEX, and the MICEX did not fix a ruble-dollar rate that day. On 2 September 1998 the Central Bank of the Russian Federation decided to abandon the \\"floating peg\\" policy and float the ruble freely. By 21 September 1998 the exchange rate had reached 21 rubles for one US dollar, meaning it had lost two-thirds of its value of less than a month earlier. On 28 September 1998 Boris Fyodorov was discharged from the position of the Head of the State Tax Service. The moratorium imposed by the Joint Statement expired on 15 November 1998, and the Russian government and Central Bank did not renew it. =Inflation= Russian inflation in 1998 reached 84 percent and welfare costs grew considerably. Many banks, including Inkombank, Oneximbank and Tokobank, closed as a result of the crisis. =Banking= Bankers Trust suffered major losses in the summer of 1998 due to the bank having a large position in Russian government bonds, but avoided financial collapse by being acquired by Deutsche Bank for $10 billion in November 1998. This made Deutsche Bank the fourth-largest money management firm in the world after UBS, Fidelity Investments, and the Japanese post office's life insurance fund. =Agriculture= The main effect of the crisis on Russian agricultural policy has been a dramatic drop in federal subsidies to the sector, about 80 percent in real terms compared with 1997, though subsidies from regional budgets fell less.Web Archives: View Archived Page. Ers.usda.gov. Retrieved on 23 October 2013. =Political fallout= The financial collapse resulted in a political crisis as Yeltsin, with his domestic support evaporating, had to contend with an emboldened opposition in the parliament. A week later, on 23 August 1998, Yeltsin fired Kiriyenko and declared his intention of returning Chernomyrdin to office as the country slipped deeper into economic turmoil. Powerful business interests, fearing another round of reforms that might cause leading enterprises to fail, welcomed Kiriyenko's fall, as did the Communists. Yeltsin, who began to lose his hold on power as his health deteriorated, wanted Chernomyrdin back, but the legislature refused to give its approval. After the Duma rejected Chernomyrdin's candidacy twice, Yeltsin, his power clearly on the wane, backed down. Instead, he nominated Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who on 11 September 1998 was approved by the State Duma by an overwhelming majority. Primakov's appointment restored political stability because he was seen as a compromise candidate able to heal the rifts between Russia's quarreling interest groups. There was popular enthusiasm for Primakov as well. Primakov promised to make the payment of wages and pensions his government's first priority and invited members of the leading parliamentary factions into his Cabinet. Communists and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia staged a nationwide strike on 7 October 1998 and called on President Yeltsin to resign. On 9 October 1998, Russia, which was also suffering from a poor harvest, appealed for international humanitarian aid, including food. Recovery Russia bounced back from the August 1998 financial crash with surprising speed. Much of the reason for the recovery is that world oil prices increased rapidly during 1999‚Äì2000 and Russia ran a large trade surplus in 1999 and 2000. Another reason is that domestic industries, such as food processing, had benefited from the devaluation, which caused a steep increase in the prices of imported goods. Also, since Russia's economy was operating to such a large extent on barter and other non-monetary instruments of exchange, the financial collapse had far less of an impact on many producers than it would had the economy been dependent on a banking system. Finally, the economy had been helped by an infusion of cash. As enterprises were able to pay off debts in back wages and taxes, in turn consumer demand for goods and services produced by Russian industry began to rise. Positive effect The crisis was praised by James Cook, the senior vice president of The U.S. Russia Investment Fund, on the basis that it taught Russian bankers to diversify their assets.

According to Jace Derwin: Complex training relies upon the performance of a strength exercise, often resistance based, followed by a plyometric exercise. The strength and the plyometric exercise are usually biomechanically similar i.e. they move through similar ranges of movement. For example, a back squat followed by a box jump; or a bench press exercise followed by a jumping clap push up. Such a combination is referred to as a pair or a contrast pair. The resistance based exercise will often be a near maximal effort‚Äîabout 75‚Äì90% of the athlete's maximal lift. The plyometric portion of the training should be completed in an explosive manner. Sets are often used. Between the performance of the strength exercise and the plyometric exercise there is between a 3‚Äì12 minute rest period; opinions vary on the most efficient length.https://www.scienceforsport.com/post-activation-potentiation/ As the muscles have been intensely activated by the strength exercise, this develops in the muscles a greater potential to apply force than they would have normally. This added potential to apply force is called post-activation potentiation (PAP). It is the fundamental basis of complex training. This potential to apply force, generated by the strength exercise, is utilised by the athlete in the plyometric exercise to boost their power output to a level greater than it otherwise would have been had they been doing plyometrics alone. In this way, the plyometric exercise can be performed more powerfully. For instance, an athlete may jump higher after they have completed a back squat at 90% maximal lift, had a rest for 3‚Äì12 minutes, and then jumped; as opposed to only jumping, where they would not get this improvement. The length of the rest period is chosen to be long enough to allow the athlete to recover after the strength exercise, whilst also being short enough to allow for the high degree of muscle activation to be utilised in the plyometric exercise.Joyce, David & Lewindon, Daniel & Larson, Rett, 'Neural Preparation' in High Performance Training for Sports, Leeds:Human Kinetics, 2014, p.107 Rate of force By integrating plyometrics with strength training, there is an added benefit of improving rate of force, the speed with which force is achieved in movement.Complex Training Long term effects of complex training The ambition in a complex training regime is not just to achieve better results in an individual workout but also to condition the athlete so they can perform more powerfully as a standard. Such an improvement again relies upon what Donald Chu calls the ‚Äòneuromuscular connection‚Äô. That is the relationship between the intense activation of the nervous system and enhanced fast-twitch muscle fibre recruitment. However, in terms of long term training effects there is an added dynamic. And that is the conditioning of the body to adjust muscle fibres from slow to fast-twitch; thereby increasing the number of fast-twitch muscle fibres available for recruitment and with which to help power a given movement. Such a process is also referred to as muscle fibre type shifting. It is also often discussed in regard to converting muscle fibre types IIa to type IIb. Different training regimes can stimulate different muscle fibre type adaptions. For instance, as a result of their training body builders have a tendency to have relatively more type IIa muscle fibres which allow for forceful, but relatively slow movements. Whereas sprinters, as a result of their training, may have a larger amount of type IIb muscle fibres allowing for forceful, and relatively fast movements. Generally, the aim of complex training is to stimulate the athlete to develop more type IIb muscle fibres. This allows for their strength to be expressed quickly, which means greater power generation.Chu, Donald, ‚ÄòThe Muscular System‚Äô, in Explosive Power and Strength, Human Kinetics:Leeds, 1996, p.10 In regard to the apparent conversion of type I to type II fibres through training, leading experts attest that this is in actual fact the alteration of the muscle fibres size and ability to produce force; the percentage of fibres that are type I or type II does not change: In the context of rock climbing, and an isometric exercise preceding a plyometric one, Steve Maisch considers that one of the training goals of complex training is to operate at a level of fatigue thereby encouraging the body to learn to recruit from a wider range of muscle fibres in order to be able to apply the appropriate power. Thus, over a period of training, increasing the system strength and power output of the athlete as their body has learnt to recruit a larger number of muscle fibres. Studies on the effectiveness of complex training often last between 4 and 12 weeks and measure such abilities as vertical jump height and sprinting speed. Complex training often compares favourably to resistance only and plyometric only training programmes. There is apparently little information on longer term effects. Movements *Plyometric pushup *Medicine ball plyometrics Complex training variations There are numerous variations of complex training. The common set up is designed to stimulate maximum neural engagement and muscle fibre recruitment in a first exercise, either resistance or isometric, before following it up with the performance of a second exercise which is performed at significantly increased speed. The second exercise can often be categorised as being either plyometric or ballistic. It is designed to both utilise the PAP effect from the first exercise whilst also further increasing neural activation and muscle fibre recruitment. As a result, this enhances the athlete's ability to move powerfully. =Combat athletics= Complex training can be used by combat athletes such as boxers and martial artists in order to improve their performance. For instance, boxers may use complex training in order to increase their punching power. This may involve some sport specific variations, such as the plyometric segment of the training being punching. For example, a boxer may use a cable pulley machine to add resistance to their punches, have a rest for somewhere between 30‚Äì240 seconds, and then practice explosive punching without any resistance on a punchbag.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232210035_Applying_Complex_Training_Principles_to_Boxing_A_Practical_Approach =Weight lifting= A version of complex training can be used in weight lifting; it is also referred to as contrast loading. A heavy set of lifting is followed by a lighter set of lifting; both sets should be performed in an explosive manner. The increased activation of the nervous system and recruitment of muscle fibres in the heavy set allows for the lighter set to be performed in a more powerful and explosive manner.http://www.stack.com/a/build-explosive-power-with-these-contrast- training-workouts Weight lifting can effectively demonstrate the effects of post-activation potentiation. For example, if a person lifts a light weight, and then lifts a heavy weight, before lifting the light weight again, the light weight will be relatively easier to lift and feel lighter the second time it has been lifted. Because the intense activation of the nervous system and correspondent recruitment of muscle fibres which occurred in conjunction with the heavy lift has allowed the person to perform more powerful movements, and the weight therefore feels relatively lighter. Another resistance based explanation involves the example of heavy suitcase, light suitcase i.e. after lifting a heavy suitcase, a person lifts a similar size, but light suitcase with no idea what is in it; as the person has just been carrying a heavy suitcase, their level of power application is well in excess of what is required to lift the light suitcase and it flies off the floor. =Rock climbing= Complex training may be utilised by rock climbers in order to develop their ability to apply power quickly either in terms of dynamic movement or in the securing of holds. A complex training programme for rock climbers may be very sports specific. Notably, the first resistance exercise is often, but not necessarily, replaced with an isometric exercise or hold, before being followed by a dynamic power exercise. For instance, weighted dead hangs followed by doubles on the campus board.https://www.trainingbeta.com/complex-training-with-steve-maisch/ Whilst this is a sports specific variation, the underlying ambition is the same as with other forms of complex training; to maximally stimulate the nervous system whilst increasingly recruiting fast-twitch muscle fibres in order to improve the ability to apply power.

A NOP instruction might be considered to be redundant code that has been explicitly inserted to pad out the instruction stream or introduce a time delay, for example to create a timing loop by \\"wasting time\\". Identifiers that are declared, but never referenced, are termed redundant declarations. Examples The following examples are in C. int foo(int iX) { int iY = iX*2; return iX*2; } The second \`iX*2\` expression is redundant code and can be replaced by a reference to the variable \`iY\`. Alternatively, the definition \`int iY = iX*2\` can instead be removed. Consider: #define min(A,B) ((A)<(B)?(A):(B)) int shorter_magnitude(int u1, int v1, int u2, int v2) { /* Returns the shorter magnitude of (u1,v1) and (u2,v2) */ return sqrt(min(u1*u1 + v1*v1, u2*u2 + v2*v2)); } As a consequence of using the C preprocessor, the compiler will only see the expanded form: int shorter_magnitude(int u1, int v1, int u2, int v2) { int temp; if (u1*u1 + v1*v1 < u2*u2 + v2*v2) temp = u1*u1 + v1*v1; /* Redundant already calculated for comparison */ else temp = u2*u2 + v2*v2; /* Redundant already calculated for comparison */ return sqrt(temp); } Because the use of min/max macros is very common, modern compilers are programmed to recognize and eliminate redundancy caused by their use. There is no redundancy, however, in the following code: #define max(A,B) ((A)>(B)?(A):(B)) int random(int cutoff, int range) { return max(cutoff, rand()%range); } If the initial call to rand(), modulo range, is greater than or equal to cutoff, rand() will be called a second time for a second computation of rand()%range, which may result in a value that is actually lower than the cutoff. The max macro will thus not work, in the, perhaps expected, way, for this function.

Each cell generated a different tone (G, C, D, E, G8) when detecting black print, so that each character was associated with a specific time-varying chords of tones. With some practice, blind users were able to interpret this audio output as a meaningful message. However, the reading speed of this device was very slow (approximately one word per minute). From 1944 until up to the 1970s, new prototypes of reading machine were developed at Haskins Laboratories under contract from the Veterans Administration. The research project was conducted by Caryl Parker Haskins, Franklin S. Cooper and Alvin Liberman. Their first attempts to improve the optophone all ended in failures, and users were still unable to read more than 5 words per minutes in average, even after long training sessions. This observation led Alvin Liberman to suppose that the limitation was cognitive rather than technical, and to formulate his Motor theory of speech perception. He realized that the speech signal was not heard like an acoustic \\"alphabet\\" or \\"cipher,\\" but as a \\"code\\" of overlapping speech gestures, due to coarticulation. Therefore, a reading machine cannot simply convert the printed characters into a series of abstract sounds, rather it must be able to identify the characters and to produce a speech sound as output using a speech synthesizer. The first commercial reading machine for the blind was developed by Kurzweil Computer Products (later acquired by Xerox Corporation) in 1975. Walter Cronkite used this machine to give his signature soundoff, \\"And that's the way it is, January 13, 1976.\\" http://www.kurzweiltech.com/kcp.html In the mid-1960s, Francis F. Lee joined Dr. Samuel Jefferson Mason's Cognitive Information Processing Group in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT to work on a reading machine for the blind, the first system that would scan text and produce continuous speech.RLE Timeline 1960-1979 http://www.rle.mit.edu/about/history/timeline-1960-1 Retrieved 3 January 2015 Early reading machines were desk-based and large, found in libraries, schools, and hospitals or owned by wealthy individuals. In 2009, a cellphone running Kurzweil-NFB software works as a reading machine.

Their genealogies claimed descent from Cormac Cas, who is said to have lived in the 3rd century AD. Their known ancestors are the subject of The Expulsion of the D√©isi tale and one branch of their blood-line went on to rule the petty kingdom of Dyfed in Wales during the 4th century; probably in alliance with the Roman Emperor Magnus Maximus. Brian B√≥ruma is perhaps the best-known king from the dynasty and was responsible to a significant degree for carving out their fortunes. The family had built a power base on the banks of the River Shannon and Brian's brother Mahon became their first King of Munster, taking the throne from the rival E√≥ganachta. This influence was greatly extended under Brian who became High King of Ireland, following a series of conflicts with Norse and other Irish tribes, before dying famously at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. Following this the D√°l gCais provided three more High Kings of Ireland; Donnchad mac Briain, Toirdelbach Ua Briain and Muirchertach Ua Briain. From the 12th‚Äì16th centuries, the D√°l gCais contented themselves with being reduced to the Kingdom of Thomond. They attempted to claim the Kingdom of Desmond for a time, but ultimately the MacCarthys held it. The Kennedys also held the Kingdom of Ormond for a time. Some of the better known septs included O'Brien, Moloney, MacNamara, O'Grady, O'Gorman, Kennedy, MacMahon, McInerney, and Clancy. During the 13th century Richard Strongbow's relatives the Norman de Clares attempted to take Thomond, but the D√°l gCais held firm. It wasn't until the 16th century, unable to be defeated militarily, they agreed to surrender and regrant their kingdom to Henry VIII Tudor, joining the nobility of the Kingdom of Ireland. Their realm was renamed County Clare, though they remained influential. In later times, remarkable figures include writer Standish James O'Grady, who is called \\"Father of the Celtic Revival\\" and William Smith O'Brien who played a leading part in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. In diaspora, prominent figures have included Marshal Patrice de Mac-Mahon, President of France, as well as John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, who were both Presidents of the United States. History =Origins, D√©isi Muman vs. Deirgtine= In their own genealogies, the D√°l gCais traced their line back to their eponymous ancestor and progenitor Cormac Cas, who is said to have lived in the 2nd to 3rd century. They make him a second son of Ailill Aulom from the Deirgtine, a King of Munster and Leath Moga more generally, associated in a story with the goddess √Åine of the Tuatha D√© Danann during the Cycles of the Kings of Irish mythology. Cormac Cas himself was purported to be the younger brother of E√≥gan, founder of the E√≥ganachta, who would go on to rule Munster for many centuries. While this was taken on face value for a long time, later Irish scholars came to question its validity, regarding it as a politically motivated fabrication. The D√°l gCais were becoming powerful in the 10th century, with Mahon and his brother Brian B√≥ruma taking the throne in Munster from the E√≥ganachta; claiming ancient kinship with their rivals would have boosted their legitimacy. Aerial view of the River Shannon, the area where the D√°l gCais grew in power. It is claimed by current scholarship that the D√°l gCais were instead a branch of the D√©isi Muman. The D√©isi Muman held a vassal kingship in Munster under the E√≥ganachta, significant in scope, consisting of what is today Waterford and its environs. As time went on branches also emerged around the River Shannon, as part of the D√©isi Muman moved north- westerly between the 5th and early 8th century; they were called the D√©isi Deiscirt and the D√©isi Tuisceart. It is from later, more northerly branch, which the D√°l gCais are said to ultimately find their true ancestors. The first recorded mention of their adoption of the new name D√°l gCais specifically is in the Annals of Inisfallen for the year 934, which records the death of their king Rebach√°n mac Mothlai. The D√©isi Muman themselves are subject of The Expulsion of the D√©isi epic in the Cycles of the Kings, which is set during the time that Cormac Ulfada was High King of Ireland. The story describes the expulsion of the Dal Fiachrach Suighe; kinsmen of the Connachta and descendants of Fedlimid Rechtmar; from Tara, coming to settle in Munster after many battles. Upon becoming the D√©isi Muman, one branch then sailed across to Britain in the 4th century, coming to rule Dyfed. Their presence in Britain may have been initially supported by Magnus Maximus, Roman Emperor, as part of a policy of backing Gaelic vassals to be seafaring defenders of the shores of Britain facing the Irish Sea from pirates. Eoin MacNeill has pointed out that they were not the only Irish colony in the area, with the U√≠ Liath√°in also powerful. =Ascent to the High Kingship of Ireland= The adoption of the name D√°l gCais and the ascent of the group to greater power, began to take place during the 10th century with internal political transition. With the death of Rebach√°n mac Mothlai, the leadership of the D√©isi Tuisceart shifted from the U√≠ Aengusa kindred to their junior relatives the U√≠ Thairdelbaig. It was during the time of Kennedy, who styled himself King of Thomond, that the D√°l gCais began to challenge the E√≥ganachta; though Kennedy was defeated at the Battle of Gort Rotach√°in by Cellach Caisil, King of Munster in 944. The actual reason for this sudden surge has been much debated and one frequently discussed thesis is that it was a political scheme of the U√≠ N√©ill, intending to use the D√°l gCais as proxies to further weaken the power of the E√≥ganachta. Brian B√≥ruma, High King of Ireland, perhaps the best known historical figure of the D√°l gCais. Kennedy's children built on their father's achievements. His daughter √ìrlaith became Queen consort of Ireland, after she married Donagh Donn, a High King of Ireland from the southern branch of the U√≠ N√©ill. Mahon became the first D√°l gCais to gain the kingship of Munster, after he seized the Rock of Cashel from Molloy of the E√≥ganachta. Leading up to this he had defeated the Norse under Ivar of Limerick at the Battle of Sulcoit in 968. After Mahon was captured by Donovan in 976 and murdered by Molloy, the E√≥ganachta returned to the throne at Cashel for two years, but Mahon's younger brother Brian B√≥ruma, a seasoned military man from the early campaigns, would desire vengeance. A campaign in 977-78 led to the defeat and death of Ivar, with an engagement at Scattery Island being the most significant. Brian retained the formerly Norse Limerick for its trading power and naval strength. The D√°l gCais took back Munster at Belach Lechta the same year, killing Molloy in the process. Ambition saw Brian look next to the territories of Malachy II, High King of Ireland. A closely contested war of 15 years ensued, with the naval ability of the D√°l gCais paying off as a truce was called by Malachy in 997, recognising Brian's overlordship of Leath Moga. They became allies against the Norse Dublin and the Laigin who under M√°el M√≥rda, King of Leinster had risen against Brian's claims. The latter were subdued at Glenmama in 999, before rebelling again in 1014 at Clontarf where Norse power in Ireland was finally broken, though Brian died in the process. In the interim, Malachy had passed the High Kingship to Brian in 1002 and he built strong Christian links to Armagh. After the death of Brian, his two established surviving sons; Donagh and Teague; struggled in an internal D√°l gCais rivalry for dominion. While Donagh was High King, many other Irish kings allied against him, including Leinster, Connacht, and Ulster. Deposed in 1063, he fled to Rome, with some sources claiming he granted Pope Urban II the Irish crown, this is controversial, however.Donagh certainly fled to Rome and was buried at the Basilica di Santo Stefano al Monte Celio. The stories about his time there are recorded by Geoffrey Keating in the 17th century, some with skepticism. The story was used in the 19th century as a potential explanation for Laudabiliter. Teague's son Turlough took up the reins in a lasting alliance with the powerful Dermot Kinsella, King of Leinster. Not a military leader, Turlough was instead a capable politician, the Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib glorifying Brian's feats would be authored during his lifetime. Turlough's son Murtagh would be the last High King from the D√°l gCais of the medieval period, reigning between 1101‚Äì19. Murtagh attempted to make the Irish kingship more along the lines of European monarchies and was involved in foreign affairs (allying with Arnulf de Montgomery in the Welsh Marches against Henry I, King of England), trying to extend Irish influence beyond internal rivalries. Dynastic divisions =Septs and kindreds= The septs of the D√°l gCais developed over time, with new ones breaking off to form separate surnames at different times, but all claiming to share the same paternal line (with a few biological exceptions along the way due to adoption or extra-marital issue). Their eponymous founder Cas had several sons; two of them gave their names to the U√≠ Bloid and U√≠ Caisin kindreds, another founded the Ui Fearmaic. As the proto-D√°l gCais moved up into what is today East Clare, these became associated with rooted tribal areas, but were themselves internally divided into any other septs. Tree graph showing relationships between the Dalcassian septs.Most information about the relationship between septs and their genealogical root can be found in John O'Hart's Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation, where he worked from 17th century genealogists C√∫ Choigcr√≠che √ì Cl√©irigh and Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, as well as the Annals of the Four Masters. The senior line descended from Cas' first son Bloid and they provided the Kings of Thomond. Initially the leaders of the tribe were a sept known as the U√≠ Aengusa from which descends O'Curry, O'Cormacan and O'Seasnain. However, during the 10th century, this passed to the junior U√≠ Thairdelbaig. It is this kindred which would furnish the High Kings of Ireland and the Kings of Thomond including Brian B√≥ruma. From the U√≠ Thairdelbaig came O'Brien, O'Kennedy (who were Kings of Ormond), MacConsidine, MacMahon, O'Reagan, MacLysaght, O'Kelleher, Boland, Cramer, Kearney, O'Casey, Power, Twomey, Eustace, Ahearne, MacGrath, Quick, O'Meara, Scanlan, MacArthur, Cosgrave, O'Hogan, Lonergan and others. O'Noonan and Coombe are other notable U√≠ Bloid descendants. A younger brother of Carthann Fionn (who both the U√≠ Thairdelbaig and U√≠ Aengusa derive) named Brennan Ban stands at the head of the genealogies for the O'Brennan, Glinn, Muldowney and O'Hurley septs. Although a junior line, the U√≠ Caisin continued to have a prominent role and the leader of their kindred in Thomond were the MacNamara, who as Lords of Clancullen, were the second most powerful family after the O'Brien. Other families descended from the branch of Carthann (son of Caisin) include Harley, Flood, Torrens, Stoney, Hickey, O'Hay, Clancy, Neylon and Flattery. Carthann had brothers named Eocha and Sineall from whom descends the O'Grady, Tubridy, Hartigan, Durkin, Killeen and Hogg. In addition to this, there are the Ui Fearmaic who claim to descend from Aengus Cinathrach, a brother of Caisin and Bloid. This kindred included the O'Dea as leaders, as well as the O'Quin, O'Griffin / O'Griffey (chieftains of Cineal Cuallachta), O'Heffernan, Kielty and Perkin. =Titles and social roles= Within the traditional Gaelic culture of Ireland, society rested on the pillars of the tribal nobility, bardic poet historians and priests. Different families had different roles to play and in many cases, this was a hereditary role. However, the nature of this system, known as tanistry was aristocratic (\\"rule by the best\\") in the truest sense, in that if the tribe thought a younger male member of the family was more suitable to succeed to a role than an older sibling, then they could. The Norman and wider European concept of strict primogeniture was not completely adopted until after some of the families joined the peerage of Ireland. The most powerful Dalcassian family of the hereditary Gaelic nobility were the O'Brien (Kings of Thomond), followed by MacNamara (Lords of Clann Cuilean), O'Kennedy (Kings of Ormond), MacMahon (Lords of Corca Baiscinn), O'Grady (Lords of Cin√©l Dongaile) and O'Dea (Lords of Ui Fearmaic). Some of these families later joined the peerage of Ireland after the surrender and regrant to the Tudors during the 16th century. The O'Brien was initially Earls of Thomond, but later became Barons Inchiquin which they hold to this day. The O'Grady was Viscounts Guillamore, while the O'Quins became Earls of Dunraven. A branch of the MacMahon family became Marquis de MacMahon d'Eguilly in the Kingdom of France, later raised to Dukes of Magenta under Emperor Napoleon III. The Clancy sept was the hereditary Brehons of Thomond and held a very powerful position when it came to the law in the kingdom. Even after the end of the Gaelic order, they continued to play a role, providing a High Sheriff of Clare in the form of Boetius Clancy. Famously participating in the Contention of the Bards in support of the honour of the tribe, the MacBrody sept were the principal poets and historians of the D√°l gCais over the course of centuries. The O'Hickey and Neylon sept would serve as hereditary physicians to the Dalcassians of Thomond. After the Norman Butler dynasty took Ormond, the Dalcassian sept of O'Meara became their hereditary physicians, this line included Barry Edward O'Meara, who was with Emperor Napoleon I in exile at St. Helena. =Chieftainship= The D√°l gCais polity up until the 10th century was approximately co-terminus with modern East Clare and exercised a large degree of regional autonomy from the E√≥ganachta Kings of Munster, and were powerful enough to kill the King of Cashel in battle in 713.Bart Jaski, 'The (legendary) rise of D√°l Cais', in: Se√°n Duffy (ed.), Medieval Dublin XVI: proceedings of Clontarf 1014‚Äì2014: national conference marking the millennium of the Battle of Clontarf (Dublin, 2017). 15‚Äì61., https://www.academia.edu/38265900/Bart_Jaski_The_legendary_rise_of_D%C3%A1l_Cais_in_Se%C3%A1n_Duffy_ed._Medieval_Dublin_XVI_proceedings_of_Clontarf_1014_2014_national_conference_marking_the_millennium_of_the_Battle_of_Clontarf_Dublin_2017_._15_61?source=swp_share The earliest Kings were derived from the U√≠ Oengusso kindred (descendents of Oengus, senior son of Carthann Finn who is said to be the first King of D√°l gCais). On the death of Reabac√°n Mac Mothla in 934 the Kingship passed to the junior branch of U√≠ Toirdhealbhach descended from Eochaidh Bailldearg, another son of Carthann and the power of the D√°l gCais began to expand greatly. Cinn√©idigh was the first Dalcassian King to lead an army beyond his own territory and was acknowledged as King of Thomond by his death. His son Mathgamain built on these achievements, capturing Cashel and becoming King of Munster. The best-known member of this dynasty, Brian Boru, took over after his brother Mathgamain's death, reclaimed the Munster kingship and eventually succeeded in establishing himself as High King of Ireland before his famous death in the Battle of Clontarf. The D√°l gCais under Brian's descendents, the Ua Briain would provide a further three High Kings of Ireland and exercised supremacy in Munster until Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, taking advantage of war between brothers Diarmait and former High-King Muircheartach, invaded Munster and split it in two in the Treaty of Glanmire (1118) granting Thomond to the sons of Diarmait Ua Briain and Desmond to the leading sept of the dispossessed Eoganacht, the Mac C√°rthaigh dynasty. After the death of Domnall M√≥r Ua Briain, a claimant to the Kingship of Munster, they further retreated beyond the Shannon into the area of modern County Clare in the wake of the Norman Invasion. In 1276 King Edward II granted all of Thomond to Thomas de Clare, taking advantage of the feuding between Clann Taidhg and Clann Briain (whom de Clare supported). The de Clares failed in conquering Thomond and were decisively defeated in the Battle of Dysert O'Dea in 1318, thus the Kingdom of Thomond remained outside of foreign control for a further 200 years.The Normans in Thomond, Joe Power http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/norman.htm In 1543 Murchadh Carrach √ì Briain, under pressure from the impending Tudor conquest, agreed to surrender his Gaelic Royalty to King Henry VIII and accepted the titles Earl of Thomond and Baron Inchiquin. At his death in 1551 the Earldom passed to his nephew Donough by special remainder and the title Baron Inchiquin passed to his male heirs through his son Dermot. The Earldom went extinct at the death of Henry O'Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond, the next heir would have been a descendant of Daniel O'Brien, 3rd Viscount Clare who was attainded in 1691, so the title became forfeit. However, Charles O'Brien, 6th Viscount Clare, a Jacobite exile used the title Earl of Thomond, as did his son, who died childless in 1774. At the death of James O'Brien, 3rd Marquess of Thomond, the title Baron Inchiquin passed to a distant cousin and descendent of Murrough, Sir Lucius O'Brien, 5th Baronet and was passed down to his descendents.

These involuntary furloughs may be short or long term, and many of those affected may seek other temporary employment during that time.  United States  = US federal government = In the United States, involuntary furloughs concerning federal government employees may be of a sudden and immediate nature. Such was the case in February 2010, when a single United States Senate objection prevented emergency funding measures from being implemented. As a result, 2,000 federal workers for the Department of Transportation were immediately furloughed as of March 1, 2010. The second-longest such shutdown was December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996, which affected all non-essential employees, shutting down many services including National Institutes of Health, visa and passport processing, parks, and many others. This happened again on October 1, 2013, and on January 19, 2018. The United States Congress failed to pass a re- authorization of funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, and as a result, furloughed about 4,000 workers at midnight on July 22, 2011.  Potential furlough in 2011  Congress was on the verge of forcing a government shutdown on April 8, 2011, if their plan to reduce the federal budget deficit was not resolved, which would have caused the furlough of 800,000 out of two million civilian federal employees.  Furloughs in 2013  The first federal government furloughs of 2013 went into effect as a result of budget sequestration (or sequester) ‚Äì the automatic spending cuts in particular categories of federal outlays. (This procedure was first used in the Gramm‚ÄìRudman‚ÄìHollings Balanced Budget Act of 1985.) The sequesters were designed to take place if the federal deficit exceeded a set of fixed deficit targets. In 2013 specifically, sequestration refers to a section of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) that was initially set to begin on January 1, 2013, as an austerity fiscal policy. These cuts were postponed by two months by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 until March 1, when this law went into effect. At that time, most federal departments and agencies began furloughing their employees in order to meet their spending cut targets. For the Department of Defense, almost all of the civilian workforce as well as most full-time, dual-status military technicians of the National Guard and the Reserves were affected. The initial furlough requirement was 176 working hours per affected employee, which was later cut to 88 hours. Due to cost-cutting measures in other areas, this furlough was further reduced to a total of 48 working hours per DoD civilian and full-time Reserve Component member. Later, on October 1, 2013, at 12:01 am EDT, Congress' inability to agree on a spending bill led to a government shutdown. During the shutdown, most \\"non- essential\\" government employees were furloughed. This resulted in approximately 800,000 government workers being put on a leave beginning October 1. Congress later unanimously voted to restore pay to the furloughed workers.  Furloughs in 2018 and 2019 Due to the government shutdown starting on December 22, 2018, approximately 350,000 federal employees were furloughed for 35 days until January 25, 2019.  Furloughs in 2020 in the United States  In September 2019 the United States Department of Labor issued Fact Sheet #70 governing furloughs. These rules have remained in place (), but with new developments in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, new rules and guidance could be issued at any time. The United States Department of Labor has a Coronavirus Resources page which can be consulted for the latest developments.Coronavirus Resources = Schools = Board members of various school districts as well as universities implemented \\"furlough days\\" in 2009. This made students pay the same rate, if not more, for their education while providing fewer educational days by forcing educators and staff members to take the day off. In states such as Georgia, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia included a clause so that mandatory furlough days are implemented but no classes are lost during the 2009‚Äì2010 academic year. In California, the State Employee Trades Council (SETC) voted to implement a mandatory two-day-per-month furlough policy for the staff and faculty of the CSU system. The furloughs, intended to prevent layoffs, began in August 2009, and ended in June 2010. The 10% cut saved about $270 million of the CSU's $564 million budget deficit. =Private sector= During the global recession of 2009 companies such as Intel, Toyota, and Gannett implemented furloughs. In the US federal government shutdown of 2013 federal contractors such as Lockheed Martin and United Technologies considered furloughing their own employees. In 2020, retail giants, including Kohl's and Macy's, furloughed thousands of employees because of decreased sales connected to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  United Kingdom  The word furlough was used until at least 1908 to describe military personnel home on leave. It was also widely used by religious groups in the twentieth century to refer to the periods when their missionaries returned to the UK on long leave. =COVID-19 pandemic= In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Her Majesty's Government introduced what was described as a \\"furlough\\" programme to support employers and workers. For many years the term \\"furlough\\" had been very little known in the United Kingdom, and many HR managers were not acquainted with the US \\"furlough\\" system. Formally named the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, it funded businesses to continue paying 80% of employees‚Äô salary for those that would otherwise have been made unemployed. Other uses The term furlough in employment can also refer to annual leave, long service leave, time off based on a company-planned schedule. For example, with a \\"work three weeks, off one week\\" schedule, a company's workforce is divided into four groups. Each group, in turn, takes a week off on furlough while the remainder work. It can also refer to a vacation from missionary work, military leave, or, in the case of convicts, parole, probation, conjugal visit, or work release.

The Academy is sponsored by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce and is located in Tipton, West Midlands. The Academy is the first in the UK to follow the Opening Minds curriculum throughout all year groups. The school's history dates back to September 1958, when Willingsworth Secondary Modern School to serve the Ocker Hill and Princes End areas of Tipton, replacing a smaller secondary modern at Ocker Hill and gaining comprehensive status in September 1969, when it became Willingsworth High. It became the RSA Academy in September 2008 and moved into its current buildings in September 2010, with the old buildings being demolished the following spring. It is one of the seven schools in the RSA Family of Academies, all in the West Midlands, of the Royal Society of Arts. Schools and Houses The Academy has three \\"schools\\" - Arts, Humanities, Sport and Leisure; Maths, Science and Technology; and Languages and Communication - and three houses - Romney, Shipley and Adam. Each house founder has a connection with the RSA. Senior staff The Principal of the Academy is Mr Daulton Redmond and Mr Mat Carpenter and Ms Sarah Barnes are the Vice Principals. New building The RSA Academy moved into a new building on the original school's site in September 2010. The old Willingsworth buildings were damaged by fire shortly afterwards and demolished in early 2011. The new building, by architectural practice John McAslan Partnership, McAslan website is the first one of its kind being designed specifically for the Opening Minds curriculum. The RSA Academy was officially opened on 22 November 2010 by HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and a large number of dignitaries, donors and RSA Fellows attended. Prince Philip has made a number of official visits to Tipton; these include the opening of Summerhill Primary School on Upper Church Lane on 4 November 2008, and on 4 June 1971 he also opened Tipton Sports Union Trust's headquarters on Gospel Oak Road, within a few hundred yards of the RSA Academy (or Willingsworth High as it was at the time). School day The Academy operates a different school day from other schools, with lessons being 90 minutes long. Therefore there are only four lessons per day. The Academy also follows a 5 term year, with 2 week holidays at the end of terms 1-4 and a 4 week summer holiday. Debatemate The Academy takes part in the Birmingham area Debatemate. Debatemate website The aims of the scheme are to mentor pupils in debating and therefore improve their public speaking skills, literacy skills and general knowledge. RSA Academy compete in two of the Debatemate competitions; the Urban Debate League and the Debatemate Cup formerly known as the Richard Koch Cup. The RSA Academy won the 2011 Urban Debate League, a competition which had 120 schools competing. Fire On the evening of 11 October 2010, the disused school building was set on fire and around fifteen fire engines were sent to deal with the fire. Luckily nobody was hurt in the incident, and the police believed it may have been committed by the same arsonists who started a fire hours later at Wilkinson Primary School in nearby Bilston. The building's shell was demolished within the next six months.

It takes place in Canterbury (England) and surrounding towns and villages (including Faversham, Whitstable and Margate) each October/November and includes performances of a variety of types of music, art, comedy, circus, theatre, walks, talks and a Science strand. It has featured performances by Sir Willard White, Michael Nyman, Hugh Masekela, Rebecca Stephens, Texas and Ned Sherrin and by ensembles such as the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra, the Endellion and Brodsky Quartets, the Ensemble Cordial, Brass 10 and the Soweto Gospel Choir. Venues include Canterbury Cathedral, the Gulbenkian Theatre at the University of Kent and the Marlowe Theatre as well as the artists' homes and studios where work is displayed.  History  It was initiated in the 1920s by George Bell during his time as Dean of Canterbury. Guest artists during his time included John Mansfield, Gustav Holst, Dorothy L. Sayers, and T. S. Eliot (whose 1935 drama Murder in the Cathedral was commissioned by Bell for the festival). That was within the first ten years of the festival in which it had flourished, with its plays. The festival was established closely with the friends of Canterbury organization. In 1970 the Dean at the time and city council got together and joined forces, to work on the festival together for the first time. Then in 1984 the festival got a revamping. A new theatre had been built in Canterbury, and the festival started to include almost every art form. That year the festival included music, visual arts, cinema, theatre, literature and more. International events helped the festival gain the name of Kent‚Äôs international arts festival in 2004. That year the festival had lasted three weeks. Now the festival is two weeks but holds over 200 events in those two weeks with 65,000 festival goers. The festival also includes things like classical music, contemporary music and dance, international music, comedy, talks and even walks.  Achievements  The festival is a National Portfolio Organization, receiving national arts funding from the Arts Council. The festival also has local support and funding. The festival began to gain a relationship with other European natures such as Hungary and Poland. The festival had one year included a celebration of Hungarian culture in the presence of Hungary‚Äôs president. Then a year later the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra had played at the festival. These events are some that helped the festival gain the name, Kent‚Äôs International Arts Festival. 2009 the festival was asked by Canterbury City Council to \\"take responsibility for the continuing development of creative writing and live literature events in the district.\\" Because of that a year-round program was set up to meet the challenge of developing local creative talent in the district. This program goes by the name of Made in Kent. This is a year-round program which culminates during the Festival each Autumn. In 2014 the festival signed a five-year sponsorship with Canterbury Christ Church University.  External links and references  * Kent\`s international arts festival\\".

The men of the Isles, accompanied by forces from the Kingdom of Dublin, were commanded by Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles. The identity of the Scottish commander is unrecorded and unknown. Herbert, Bishop of Glasgow, Baldwin, Sheriff of Lanark/Clydesdale, and Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland are all possible candidates for this position. The battle was a disaster for the Islesmen and Dubliners. Somairle was slain in the encounter, apparently by local levies, and his forces were routed. Somairle first appears on record in the 1150s, when he is stated to have supported the cause of M√°el Coluim mac Alasdair in a rebellion against Malcolm IV, King of Scotland. M√°el Coluim was a member of a rival branch of the Scottish royal family, and his sons were closely related to Somairle. At about the time of the rebellion's collapse, Somairle appears to have shifted his energies from Scotland towards the Isles. In 1156, he wrested about half of the Kingdom of the Isles from his brother-in-law, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r √ìl√°fsson, King of the Isles. Two years later, Somairle decisively defeated Gu√∞r√∏√∞r, gaining complete control of the kingdom. The reasons for Somairle's invasion of Scotland are uncertain. One possibility is that he was renewing his support for the sons of M√°el Coluim. Another possibility is that he was attempting to conquer the southwest part of Scotland that may have only recently fallen under Scottish royal authority. This region had previously been occupied by the Gall Gaidheil, a people of mixed Scandinavian and Gaelic ethnicity, like Somairle himself. There is reason to suspect that this region was lost to the Scots upon the collapse of M√°el Coluim's rebellion, and afterwards doled out to powerful Scottish magnates in the context of Scottish consolidation. Somairle may have also invaded the region in an attempt to counter a perceived threat that the Scots posed to his authority in the Firth of Clyde. The fact that the battle is said to have been fought at Renfrew, the seat of one of Walter's lordships, could indicate that he was a specific target. As a result of Somairle's death in battle, the Kingdom of the Isles fractured once again. Although Gu√∞r√∏√∞r's brother, R«´gnvaldr, is recorded to have gained power, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r was able overcome him within the year. Upon Gu√∞r√∏√∞r's reestablishment in the Isles, the realm was again divided between him and Somairle's descendants, in a partitioning that stemmed from Somairle's coup in 1156. The Battle of Renfrew may have been Malcolm's greatest victory. It is certainly the last major event of his reign on record. Background Locations relating to the Battle of Renfrew. At an uncertain point in the mid twelfth century, perhaps in about 1140, Somairle mac Gilla Brigte married Ragnhildr, daughter of √ìl√°fr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson, King of the Isles.Oram (2011) pp. 88‚Äì89; Oram, R (2004) p. 118; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 175 n. 55; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 45; Anderson (1922) p. 255 n. 1. This union had severe repercussions on the later history of the Kingdom of the Isles, as it gave Somairle's descendants‚ÄîClann Somairle‚Äîa claim to the kingship by way of Ragnhildr's royal descent.Beuermann (2012) p. 5; Beuermann (2010) p. 102; Williams, G (2007) p. 145; Woolf (2005); Brown, M (2004) p. 70; Rixson (2001) p. 85. The year 1153 marked a watershed in the history of the Isles. Not only did David I, King of Scotland die late in May,Oram (2011) p. 108. but the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann reports that √ìl√°fr was assassinated in June, whilst his son, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r, was absent in Norway.Beuermann (2014) p. 85; Downham (2013) p. 171, 171 n. 84; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 67, 85, 92; Duffy (2006) p. 65; Beuermann (2002) p. 421; Duffy (2002) p. 48; Sellar (2000) p. 191; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 259; Duffy (1993) pp. 41‚Äì42, 42 n. 59; Oram, RD (1988) pp. 80‚Äì81; Anderson (1922) p. 225; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 62‚Äì65. Within months of his father's assassination, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r executed his vengeance. According to the chronicle, he journeyed from Norway to Orkney, enstrengthened by Norwegian military support, and was unanimously acclaimed as king by the leading Islesmen. He is then stated to have continued on to Mann, where he overcame three kin-slaying cousins, and successfully secured the kingship for himself.Crawford (2014) p. 74; Downham (2013) p. 171; McDonald, RA (2012) p. 162; Abrams (2007) p. 182; McDonald, RA (2007a) p. 66; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 67, 85; Duffy (2006) p. 65; Oram (2000) pp. 69‚Äì70; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 259; Gade (1994) p. 199; Oram, RD (1988) p. 81; Anderson (1922) p. 226; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 64‚Äì67. In 1155 or 1156, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that Somairle conducted a coup against Gu√∞r√∏√∞r, specifying that Somairle's son, Dubgall, was produced as a replacement to Gu√∞r√∏√∞r's rule.Holton (2017) p. 125; Wadden (2014) p. 32; Downham (2013) p. 172; Woolf (2013) pp. 3‚Äì4; Oram (2011) p. 120; Williams, G (2007) pp. 143, 145‚Äì146; Woolf (2007a) p. 80; Barrow (2006) pp. 143‚Äì144; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 243‚Äì244; Woolf (2004) p. 104; Rixson (2001) p. 85; Oram (2000) pp. 74, 76; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 52, 54‚Äì58; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 259‚Äì260, 260 n. 114; Duffy (1993) pp. 40‚Äì41; Duffy (1992) p. 121; McDonald; McLean (1992) pp. 8‚Äì9, 12; Scott, JG (1988) p. 40; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 196; Anderson (1922) p. 231; Lawrie (1910) p. 20 ¬ß 13; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 68‚Äì69. Late in 1156, on the night of 5/6 January, Somairle and Gu√∞r√∏√∞r finally clashed in a bloody but inconclusive sea-battle. According to the chronicle, when the clash finally concluded the feuding brothers-in-law divided the Kingdom of the Isles between themselves.Caldwell (2016) p. 354; Wadden (2014) p. 32; McDonald, RA (2012) pp. 153, 161; Oram (2011) p. 120; McDonald, RA (2007a) pp. 57, 64; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 92; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 244; Woolf (2004) p. 104; Oram (2000) pp. 74, 76; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 52, 56; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 260; McDonald, RA (1995) p. 135; Duffy (1993) p. 43; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 9; Scott, JG (1988) p. 40; Rixson (1982) pp. 86‚Äì87; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 196; Anderson (1922) pp. 231‚Äì232; Lawrie (1910) p. 20 ¬ß 13; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 68‚Äì69. Two years later, the chronicle reveals that Somairle invaded Mann and drove Gu√∞r√∏√∞r from the kingship into exile.McDonald, RA (2012) pp. 153, 161; Oram (2011) p. 121; McDonald, RA (2007a) pp. 57, 64; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 92, 113, 121 n. 86; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 244; Woolf (2004) p. 104; Oram (2000) pp. 74, 76; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 56; Duffy (1993) p. 43; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 9; Rixson (1982) pp. 86‚Äì87, 151; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 196; Anderson (1922) p. 239; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 68‚Äì69. With Gu√∞r√∏√∞r gone, it appears that either Dubgall or Somairle became King of the Isles.McDonald, RA (1997) p. 57. Although the young Dubgall may well have been the nominal monarch, the chronicle makes it clear that it was Somairle who possessed the real power.Oram (2011) p. 121. Certainly, Irish sources regard Somairle as a king by the end of his career.Holton (2017) p. 124, 124 n. 14; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1164.6; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) 1083.10; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) 1083.10; Woolf (2013) p. 3; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 164; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1164.6; Sellar (2004); McLeod (2002) p. 31, 31 n. 22; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 179; Sellar (2000) p. 189; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 57‚Äì58; Anderson (1922) p. 254.

If each ship carried forty to fifty combatants, Somairle may have led between six thousand and eight thousand men.McDonald, RA (2002) p. 109. Although the tallies of combatants given by mediaeval sources are generally suspect, they can be indicative of the magnitude of a force's size.McDonald, RA (2002) pp. 117‚Äì118 n. 76. The participation of Dubliners in Somairle's venture suggests that he had an alliance with the Dubliners.Doherty (2005) p. 353. Specifically, he may have had a pact with either the overlord of Dublin, Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster,Byrne (2008) p. 23; Duffy (1993) pp. 45‚Äì46. or else with Diarmait's own overlord, Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, High King of Ireland.Wadden (2014) p. 34; Wadden (2013) pp. 208‚Äì209; Pollock (2005) p. 14, 14 n. 69; Duffy (1993) pp. 45‚Äì46. According to Carmen de Morte Sumerledi, divine intervention from St Kentigern (pictured in stained glass, in Bute Hall, University of Glasgow) delivered the Scots their victory over Somairle. According to the Chronicle of Mann,McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 13; Anderson (1922) p. 231; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 68‚Äì69. and the Chronicle of Melrose, Somairle's fleet made landfall at Renfrew.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 245; Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) p. 12; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 169 n. 16; Anderson; Anderson (1938) p. 143 n. 6; Brown, JTT (1927) p. 275; Anderson (1922) p. 254; Anderson (1908) p. 243 n. 2; Stevenson (1856) p. 130; Stevenson (1835) p. 79. It is possible that the fleet specifically landed at Inchinnan, where his forces could have first engaged the Scots.Woolf (2004) pp. 102, 104; Driscoll (2002) pp. 68, 71. The battle was evidently a fiasco for the Islesmen,Duffy (1993) p. 45. with their commanding-king killed in a skirmish against local levies.Oram (2011) p. 128; Sellar (2004); McDonald, RA (2002) p. 103. The account given by Carmen de Morte Sumerledi certainly suggests that Somairle was killed in the outset‚Äî\\"wounded by spear, slain by the sword\\"‚Äîand overcome by a hastily organised body of local defenders.Sellar (2004); McDonald, RA (2002) p. 103; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 169; Woolf (2013) p. 10; Clancy (2007) p. 126; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 62; Anderson (1922) p. 258; Lawrie (1910) p. 82 ¬ß 62; Arnold (1885) p. 388; Skene (1871) p. 450. As such, Somairle could have fallen in the opening encounter, with his leaderless followers giving up the fight.Woolf (2004) p. 105. The account given by Carmen de Morte Sumerledi further states that Somairle's head was cut off by a priest, and presented to Herbert, Bishop of Glasgow.Neville (2016) p. 7; Clanchy (2014) p. 169; Woolf (2013) p. 11; Clancy (2012) p. 19; Clancy (2007) p. 126; Sellar (2004); McDonald, RA (1997) p. 62; Anderson (1922) p. 258; Lawrie (1910) p. 82 ¬ß 62; Arnold (1885) p. 388; Skene (1871) p. 450. According to Gesta Annalia I, Somairle was killed with a son named Gilla Coluim.Sellar (2000) p. 195 n. 32; Anderson (1922) p. 255 n. 1; Skene (1872) p. 252 ch. 4; Skene (1871) p. 257 ch. 4; Stevenson (1835) p. 79 n. d. It is possible that this source has mistaken the latter's name for Gilla Brigte,Sellar (2004); Sellar (2000) p. 195 n. 32; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 197 n. 6. the name that the Annals of Tigernach accords to Somairle's slain son.Holton (2017) p. 125; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1164.6; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 76; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1164.6; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 62; Anderson (1922) p. 254. It is unknown if Dubgall participated in the battle.McDonald, RA (1997) p. 72. The stated location of Renfrew could be evidence that the target of Somairle's strike was Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland.Oram (2011) p. 128; Scott, WW (2008); McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 20. The latter certainly possessed Renfrew during his career, and it is possible that it functioned as the seat of his Strathgryfe group of holdings,McDonald, RA (2000) p. 183; Barrow (1973) p. 339; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 20; Barrow (1960) p. 20. or even as the principal seat of his entire lordship.Young; Stead (2010) p. 26; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 183; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 66; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 16; Barrow (1973) p. 339. The leadership of the Scottish forces is uncertain.Barrow (1960) p. 20. It is conceivable that the commander was one of the three principal men of the region: Herbert,Oram (2011) p. 128; Woolf (2004) p. 105; Barrow (1960) p. 20. Baldwin, Sheriff of Lanark/Clydesdale,Oram (2011) p. 128; Barrow (1960) p. 20. and Walter.Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) p. 12; Woolf (2004) p. 105; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 184; Roberts (1999) p. 96; Martin, FX (1992) p. 19; McDonald; McLean (1992) pp. 20‚Äì21; Barrow (1981) p. 48. Whilst there is reason to suspect that Somairle focused his offensive upon Walter's lordship at Renfrew,Oram (2011) p. 128; Hammond (2010) p. 13; Scott, WW (2008); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 245; McDonald, RA (2000) pp. 183‚Äì184; Roberts (1999) p. 96; Barrow (1960) p. 20. it is also possible that Herbert, as Malcolm's agent in the west, was the intended target.Pollock (2005) p. 14. Certainly, Carmen de Morte Sumerledi associates Herbert with the victory,Woolf (2013) pp. 7‚Äì11; Clancy (2012) p. 19; Clancy (2007) p. 126; Sellar (2004); Durkan (2003) p. 230; Durkan (1998) p. 137; Barrow (1981) p. 48; Barrow (1960) p. 20; Brown, JTT (1927) p. 274; Anderson (1922) pp. 256‚Äì258; Lawrie (1910) pp. 80‚Äì83 ¬ß 62; Arnold (1885) pp. 387‚Äì388; Skene (1871) pp. 449‚Äì451. and makes no mention of Walter or any Scottish royal forces.Clanchy (2014) p. 169; Brown, JTT (1927) pp. 274‚Äì274. On the other hand, Baldwin's nearby lands of Inverkip and Houston were passed by Somairle's naval forces, suggesting that it was either Baldwin or his followers who engaged and overcame the invaders. In any case, the victory over the Islesmen and their allies appears to have ensured peace in Scotland for the rest of Malcolm's rule.Scott, WW (2008). It may have been Malcolm's greatest victory,Clanchy (2014) p. 169. and is certainly the last major event of his reign on record.Oram (2011) p. 129. Context Twelfth-century depictions of Malcolm IV, King of Scotland and his grandfather, David I, King of Scotland. Somairle's rise to power appears to coincide with an apparent weakening of Scottish royal authority in Argyll.Woolf (2004) pp. 102‚Äì103. Such outside influence in Argyll may be evidenced by Scottish royal acta. Specifically, one royal charter, dating to 1141√ó1147, reveals that David granted a portion of his c√°in from Argyll and Kintyre to Holyrood Abbey.MacDonald (2013) p. 37; Oram (2011) p. 88; Woolf (2004) pp. 102‚Äì103; Barrow (1999) pp. 124‚Äì125 ¬ß 147; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 10; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) pp. 195‚Äì196; Lawrie (1905) pp. 116‚Äì119 ¬ß 153, 383‚Äì386 ¬ß 153; Document 1/4/74 (n.d.). Another charter, dating to 1145√ó1153, shows that the king granted a portion of his c√°in from Argyll of Moray, and other revenue from Argyll, to Urquhart Priory.MacDonald (2013) p. 37; Barrow (1999) pp. 144‚Äì145 ¬ß 185; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 10; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) pp. 195‚Äì196; Lawrie (1905) pp. 204‚Äì205 ¬ß 255, 442 ¬ß 255; Document 1/4/104 (n.d.). Several years later, in 1150√ó1152, David granted another portion of his c√°in in Argyll and Kintyre to Dunfermline Abbey.MacDonald (2013) p. 37; Woolf (2004) pp. 102‚Äì103; Barrow (1999) pp. 136‚Äì138 ¬ß 172; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 10; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) pp. 195‚Äì196; Lawrie (1905) pp. 167‚Äì171 ¬ß 209, 417‚Äì419 ¬ß 209; Document 1/4/92 (n.d.). The fact that this charter includes the caveat \\"in whatever year I should receive it\\" could indicate that, between 1141 and 1152, the Scottish Crown lost royal control of these territories to Somairle.MacDonald (2013) p. 37; Woolf (2004) pp. 102‚Äì103; Barrow (1999) pp. 136‚Äì138 ¬ß 172; Lawrie (1905) pp. 167‚Äì171 ¬ß 209, 417‚Äì419 ¬ß 209; Document 1/4/92 (n.d.). Although David may well have regarded Argyll as a Scottish tributary, Somairle's ensuing career clearly reveals that the latter regarded himself a fully independent ruler.Oram (2011) pp. 87‚Äì88. Somairle's first attestation by a contemporary source occurs in 1153,Woolf (2013) pp. 2‚Äì3. when the Chronicle of Holyrood reports that he backed the cause of his , the Meic M√°el Coluim, in an unsuccessful coup after David's death.Wadden (2014) p. 39; Woolf (2013) pp. 2‚Äì3; Oram (2011) pp. 72, 111‚Äì112; Carpenter (2003) ch. 7 ¬∂ 46; Ross (2003) pp. 184‚Äì185; Anderson; Anderson (1938) pp. 124‚Äì125, 187; Anderson (1922) p. 223‚Äì224; Bouterwek (1863) p. 36; Stevenson (1856) p. 73. These ‚Äîpossibly nephews or grandsons of Somairle‚Äîwere the sons of M√°el Coluim mac Alasdair, a claimant to the Scottish throne, descended from an elder brother of David, Alexander I, King of Scotland.Wadden (2013) p. 208; Woolf (2013) p. 3; Oram (2011) pp. 112, 120; Ross (2003) pp. 181‚Äì185; Oram (2001). There is reason to suspect that some of the campaigning conducted by Somairle and the Meic M√°el Coluim is also evinced by Carmen de Morte Sumerledi, which refers to his wasting of Glasgow, its cathedral, and surrounding countryside.Woolf (2013) pp. 6‚Äì9; M√°rkus (2007) p. 100; Anderson (1922) p. 256; Lawrie (1910) p. 81 ¬ß 62; Arnold (1885) pp. 386‚Äì387; Skene (1871) p. 449. Upon the collapse of the uprising, Somairle apparently abandoned the Meic M√°el Coluim, whereupon he turned his energies towards the Isles.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 243‚Äì244; Oram, RD (1988) p. 83. By Christmas 1160, a Scottish royal charter reveals that Somairle had come to an understanding of peace with Malcolm at some point earlier that year.Neville (2016) p. 11; MacDonald (2013) p. 30 n. 51; Woolf (2013) pp. 4‚Äì5; Oram (2011) pp. 114, 119; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 113; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 245; Sellar (2004); Woolf (2004) p. 104; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 168; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 52; Barrow (1994); McDonald; McLean (1992) pp. 9‚Äì10; Barrow (1960) p. 81; Anderson; Anderson (1938) p. 125 n. 1, 136‚Äì137 n. 1; Innes (1864) pp. 51‚Äì51; Registrum Episcopatus Moraviensis (1837) pp. 453‚Äì454 ¬ß 1; Document 1/5/52 (n.d.). Nevertheless, four years later Somairle launched his final invasion of Scotland, and it is possible that it was conducted in the context of another attempt to support M√°el Coluim's claim to the Scottish throne. Another possibility is that Somairle was attempting to secure a swathe of territory that had only recently been secured by the Scottish Crown. Although there is no record of Somairle before 1153, his family was evidently involved in an earlier insurrection by M√°el Coluim against David that ended with M√°el Coluim's capture and imprisonment in 1134. An aftereffect of this failed insurgency may be perceptible in a Scottish royal charter issued at Cadzow in about 1136.Woolf (2004) p. 103. This source records the Scottish Crown's claim to c√°in in Carrick, Kyle, Cunningham, and Strathgryfe.Woolf (2004) p. 103; Sharpe (2011) pp. 93‚Äì94 n. 236, 94; Barrow (1999) p. 81 ¬ß 57; Scott, JG (1997) p. 35; Lawrie (1905) pp. 95‚Äì96 ¬ß 125, 361‚Äì362 ¬ß 125; Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis (1843) p. 12 ¬ß 9; Document 1/4/30 (n.d.). Historically, this region appears to have once formed part of the territory dominated by the Gall Gaidheil,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 241; Woolf (2004) pp. 96‚Äì97, 99. a people of mixed Scandinavian and Gaelic ethnicity.Woolf (2004) pp. 96‚Äì97. One possibility is that these lands had formerly comprised part of a Gall Gaidheil realm before the Scottish Crown overcame M√°el Coluim and his supporters. The Cadzow charter is one of several that mark the earliest record of Fergus, Lord of Galloway,Woolf (2004) p. 103; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 171. a Scandinavian- Gaelic magnate who held lands in Carrick. Fergus' attestation could indicate that, whilst Somairle's family may have suffered marginalisation as a result of M√°el Coluim's defeat and David's consolidation of the region, Fergus and his family could have conversely profited at this time as supporters of David's cause. The record of Fergus amongst the Scottish elite at Cadzow is certainly evidence of the increasing reach of David's royal authority in the 1130s.Oram (2011) p. 89. rook gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Strickland (2012) p. 113 fig. 3.3; Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 161 fig. 6c, 184 fig. 11, 189 fig. 16. The Scandinavian connections of leading members of the Isles may have been reflected in their military armament, and could have resembled that depicted upon such gaming pieces.Strickland (2012) p. 113. Another figure first attested by these charters is Walter, a man who may have been granted the lands of Strathgryfe, Renfrew, Mearns, and North Kyle on the occasion of David's grant of c√°in.Scott, JG (1997) p. 35. One explanation for Somairle's invasion is that he may have been compelled to counter a threat that WalterClanchy (2014) p. 169; Oram (2011) p. 128; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 243, 245; Woolf (2004) p. 105; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 65‚Äì66.‚Äîand other recently-enfeoffed Scottish magnates‚Äîposed to his authority.Oram (2011) pp. 127‚Äì128; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 65‚Äì66. A catalyst of this collision of competing spheres of influence may have been the vacuum left by √ìl√°fr's assassination. Although the political uncertainty following √ìl√°fr's elimination would have certainly posed a threat to the Scots, the concurrent build-up of Scottish power along the western seaboard‚Äîparticularly exemplified by Walter's expansive territorial grants in the region‚Äîmeant that the Scots were also positioned to capitalise upon the situation.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 241‚Äì243. In fact, there is reason to suspect that, during Malcolm's reign‚Äîand perhaps with Malcolm's consent‚ÄîWalter began to extend his own authority into the Firth of Clyde, the islands of the Clyde, the southern shores of Cowal, and the fringes of Argyll.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 243, 245. The allotment of Scottish fiefs along the western seaboard suggests that these lands were settled in the context of defending the Scottish realm from external threats located in Galloway and the Isles.McDonald, RA (2000) pp. 181‚Äì182; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 65; Barrow (1973) p. 339. It was probably in this context that substantial western lordships were granted to men such as Hugh de Morville, Robert de Brus, and Walter himself.Carpenter (2003) ch. 6 ¬∂ 44; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 65. As such, the mid-part of the twelfth century saw a steady consolidation of Scottish power along the western seaboard by some of the realm's greatest magnates‚Äîmen who could well have encroached into Somairle's sphere of influence.Oram (2011) p. 127; McDonald, RA (2000) pp. 182‚Äì184; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 65‚Äì66. The continuous encroachment of Scottish authority may well have spurned Somairle to launch a counter-strike.Oram (2011) p. 127; Woolf (2007b) p. 110 n. 42; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 243, 245; Stringer (2005) p. 49; McDonald, RA (2000) pp. 182‚Äì184; Roberts (1999) p. 96. It is conceivable that Somairle first acquired the islands of the Firth of Clyde after his 1156 clash with Gu√∞r√∏√∞r. In so doing, Somairle gained control of islands in a territory that appears to have been regarded by the Scots as vital to their own security.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 244. In fact, the catalyst for the establishment of Scottish castles along the River Clyde could well have been the potential threat posed by Somairle.Strickland (2012) p. 107. Somairle's final campaign appears similar to later Norwegian-backed invasions of the Firth of Clyde conducted by his descendants in the thirteenth century (1230 and 1263). In fact, the Viking sack of Alt Clut in 870 may parallel these invasions, since it is possible that Dublin-based Vikings destroyed the fortress of Alt Clut (Dumbarton Castle) in an effort to nullify a threat posed by the Strathclyde Britons.Woolf (2007b) p. 110 n. 42. Another factor that may have spurned Somairle to attack the Scots could have been Malcolm's increasingly poor health.Oram (2011) p. 128. Certainly, the Chronicle of Melrose states that the Scottish king was stricken with a \\"great sickness\\" in 1163, and it is possible that he never fully recovered.Oram (2011) p. 126; Scott, WW (2008); Anderson (1922) p. 251; Stevenson (1856) p. 129; Stevenson (1835) p. 78. The fact that the Annals of Ulster accords Malcolm the epithet \\"Cennmor\\" (\\"Big Head\\") upon his death could be evidence that he suffered from Paget's disease.The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1165.8; Oram (2011) p. 126; Scott, WW (2008); The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1165.8; Barrow (2004a); Anderson (1922) p. 261. One possibility is that the king's impairment was opportunistically seized upon by Somairle, who overestimated a weakening in Scottish royal power. Aftermath Although it is conceivable that Dubgall was able to secure power following his father's demise, it is evident from the Chronicle of Mann that the kingship of Mann was soon seized by Gu√∞r√∏√∞r's brother, R«´gnvaldr.Oram (2011) pp. 128‚Äì129; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 67‚Äì68, 85; Anderson (1922) pp. 258‚Äì259; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 74‚Äì75. Before the end of the year, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r is said by the same source to have arrived in the Isles, and ruthlessly overpowered his brother.Oram (2011) pp. 128‚Äì129; McDonald, RA (2007a) p. 57; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 67‚Äì68, 85; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 150; Anderson (1922) pp. 258‚Äì259; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 74‚Äì75. Gu√∞r√∏√∞r thereafter regained the kingship,McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 85; Duffy (2004). and the realm was divided between him and Clann Somairle,Sellar (2004); McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 70‚Äì71; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 150. in a partitioning that stemmed from Somairle's coup in 1156.McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 70‚Äì71; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 150, 260. Although there is no direct evidence that Somairle's imperium fragmented upon his death, there is reason to suspect that it was indeed divided between his sons.Sellar (2000) p. 195; Roberts (1999) p. 97; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 70. In the decades that followed Somairle's demise, there is evidence to suggest that the known inter-dynastic infighting amongst his descendants was capitalised upon by Walter and his family.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 246‚Äì247; Murray (2005) p. 288. Queen Blearie's Stone There are several local traditions concerning the location of the battle.McDonald, RA (1997) p. 61, 61 n. 66; Metcalfe (1905) pp. 29‚Äì30. One account, dating to the late eighteenth century, asserts that the invaders landed at Renfrew, and that they marched southwards to Knock, an elevated land form situated between Renfrew and Glasgow, where they were defeated by local forces.McDonald, RA (1997) p. 61; Metcalfe (1905) pp. 29‚Äì30. In 1772, Thomas Pennant visited this site, and observed \\"a mount or tumulus, with a foss round the base, and a single stone on the top\\", which he was led to believe marked the spot where Somairle was defeated.Clark (1998) p. 3; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 61; Metcalfe (1905) pp. 29‚Äì30; Groome (1885) p. 243; Pennant (1776) pp. 172‚Äì173. Earlier accounts of the monument accorded it forms of the name \\"Queen Blearie's Stone\\", and associated it with accounts linking it to the death of Marjorie Bruce, and the caesarean birth of her son, Robert II, King of Scotland.Steele (2014) p. 145; Clark (1998) pp. 1‚Äì2; Gordon (1868) p. 566; Hamilton of Wishaw (1831) pp. 86, 141, 146; Crawfurd; Robertson (1818) p. 148. Pennant's account may have been influenced by David Dalrymple, who suggested that this name may mask a Gaelic toponym‚Äîwhich he gave as Cuin√© Blair (\\"Memorial of Battle\\")‚Äîa name that actually referred to the Battle of Renfrew.Clark (1998) p. 2; Dalrymple (1797) p. 61 n. ‚Ä†. If the monument was indeed associated with the battle, it could be identical to the pillar pictured upon Walter's seal.

During his time with Chimaira, he, along with Rob Arnold (the lead guitarist) and Mark Hunter (the lead singer) wrote many of the band's songs. In 2005, DeVries appeared on the Roadrunner United: The All Star Sessions album, playing on two of the tracks written by Joey Jordison drummer of Slipknot, \\"Annihilation by the Hands of God\\" and \\"Constitution Down\\". In 2003, DeVries was beaten badly in Liverpool while on tour with Chimaira. The attack was unprovoked and had nothing to do with DeVries' membership of Chimaira or Chimaira's genre of music in general. The band's next two performances, in Dublin, Ireland and Belfast, Northern Ireland were scheduled as normal and the band performed both concerts as a four-piece, while DeVries recovered in hospital. He was then able to join them after that for the rest of the UK/European Tour. It was announced in March 2011 that DeVries would be the touring bassist for Six Feet Under along with fellow Chimaira guitarist Rob Arnold and former Chimaira drummer Kevin Talley. Matt DeVries left Chimaira after Chimaira Christmas '11 for 'personal reasons'. In February 2012, he joined industrial metal band, Fear Factory, replacing Byron Stroud as bassist. He left the band in May 2015, being replaced by former Static-X and current Ministry bassist Tony Campos. In February 2014, he began touring as the bassist for Unearth. He filled in for John Campbell from Lamb of God on the last 2013 leg of their Resolution Tour, who had to pull out due to a family emergency. On June 21, 2017, Chimaira announced a one-off reunion show would take place on December 30, 2017. Matt later confirmed this on his social media accounts. DeVries is endorsed by ESP Guitars, and he plays his LTD MFA-600 signature model. It features an alder Viper body, a maple neck through the body with an ebony fingerboard, a TonePros Tune-O-Matic bridge, locking tuners and one EMG 81 pickup. While playing bass in Unearth and Fear Factory, he would use LTD B-series 5-string bass guitars, but eventually switched to using Ibanez Soundgear 5-string bass guitars in 2013.

It is a combination of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate. It may be used when a beta blocker, like timolol, is not sufficient alone. It is used as an eye drop. Common side effects include eye discomfort, eye redness, taste changes, and blurry vision. Serious side effects may include allergic reactions and heart failure. Use is not recommended in those with asthma, a sulfonamide allergy, or a slow heart rate. Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and timolol is a beta blocker. Both work by decreasing the amount of aqueous humor made by the eye. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. A 5 milliliter bottle in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 1.50 ¬£ as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$8.30. In 2017, it was the 233rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions.  Adverse effects  Common adverse effects include temporarily blurred vision, cloudy vision, double vision, temporary burning/stinging/itching of the eye, watery eyes, feeling as if something is in the eye, drooping eyelid, sensitivity to light, cough, flu symptoms, nausea, and stomach pain. More serious adverse effects include dizziness, slow or irregular heartbeat, muscle weakness, mental/mood changes, and coldness/numbness/pain in the hands or feet.  Pharmacology  Dorzolamide is a human carboanydrase II inhibitor. Inhibition of carboanhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion supposedly by decreasing the formation rate of bicarbonate ions. This results in reduction in both sodium and fluid transport. Timolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist.  Comparison to other products  Despite each of the active ingredients being availed in their own respective formulations, combination formulations are typically more convenient for the patient without sacrificing any quality in therapy. In the case of Cosopt, the combination formulation dosed twice daily provides equivalent treatment to both dorzolamide 2% dosed two times daily and timolol 0.5% dosed three times daily. Specifically, the mean reduction in intraocular pressure was 27.4% for the combination product, 15.5% for dorzolamide 2%, and 22.2% for timolol 0.5%. Compared to other products such as latanoprost, both are equally efficacious with regard to lowering intraocular pressure and getting patients to reach their target intraocular pressure. Cosopt, though, is typically less well tolerated than other treatments due to a well documented feeling of ocular burning upon administration.  History  Cosopt gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in April 1998 and was supplied initially by Merck. In 2016, Merck & Co. had $95.3 billion in total assets, $40.3 billion in total equity, $24.3 billion in long term debt, and $13.4 billion in working capital. This same year Merck & Co spent $20 billion total split virtually evenly between research and development (R&D;) and marketing efforts. Cosopt had annual sales of $342 million during the 12 months before June 2008. In September 2013, Merck & Co. sold the U.S. rights to their ophthalmic product line (including Cosopt) to Akorn Inc. for $52.8 million cash. Upon the original patent expiration, Hi-Tech Pharma was the first of many generic competitors to submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate eye drops. Hi-Tech Pharma's ANDA was approved on October 28, 2008. At the time, controversy surrounded the approval of this first ANDA. Hi-Tech sued the FDA for their right to 180 market exclusivity as laid out in the Hatch-Waxman Act. Apotex, another firm seeking an ANDA approval for generic Cosopt, argued that Hi-Tech \\"forfeited its rights to market exclusivity because it has failed to market the drug within 30 months of its ANDA submission or within 75 days after Merck withdrew its patent information.\\" The FDA upheld their previous exclusivity decisions on acarbose and granisetron, allowing both Hi-Tech and Apotex to make a generic version of Cosopt. Soon after, ANDAs from Sandoz, Bausch & Laumb, TEVA and others were also approved. Just over a year before Merck sold their ophthalmic line to Akorn, Akorn developed a new formulation of dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate called Cosopt PF, which is simply a preservative free formulation of Cosopt. It gained FDA approval in July 2012 and is currently protected by market exclusivity. Society and culture = Legality = In the United States, Cosopt, as well as its generics, is only available to patients with a valid prescription. = Cost = The brand name Cosopt currently costs upwards of $200 after discounts while the generic formulation costs around $70 cash. The more recent preservative free formulation can be purchased for less than the original brand name formulation at around $160 References External links *Drug information from the NIH Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Ophthalmology drugs Combination drugs Merck & Co. brands ","title":"Dorzolamide/timolol"},{"id":"3822156","text":"was a Japanese film actor from Ch≈çshi, Chiba.

In 1734 she published a volume of her poetry entitled Miscellany poems, but the cost of shipping a substantial number to the British colony of Boston in North America, where they did not sell well, forced her to turn first to teaching and then to domestic labour. She died penniless in Glasgow's Town's Hospital poorhouse at the age of sixty. Early years Born in Greenock into a maritime family, Adam was orphaned at a young age. Her most famous work (though the authorship was for some time in dispute) is \\"There's Nae Luck Aboot The Hoose\\", a tale of a sailor's wife and the safe return of her husband from the sea. It is reported that Robert Burns remarked on its quality in 1771, some years after Adam's death. Adam had a limited education in reading, writing, and sewing. She first encountered poetry when she read extracts from Sir Philip Sidney's romance The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia (1590) while working in domestic service with the minister of West Kirk, Greenock. There she also became acquainted with John Milton‚Äôs work and translations of the classics. Writing career Inspired by her reading, she started writing poetry herself and was aided by one Mr Drummond, a collector of customs and excise, in raising subscriptions for the publication of her volume of Miscellany poems, which was printed by James Duncan in 1734. There were some 150 subscribers, including customs officers, merchants, clergymen, local artisans, and the magnate Thomas Craufurd, the Laird of Cartsburn, to whom the book was dedicated. It was prefaced with a sketch of her status and background and consisted of 80 poems, virtually all on religious and moral themes. But sales were disappointing, and Adam's financial situation worsened after she used her savings to ship a substantial number of copies to British colonial Boston in North America, where they also did not sell well. Adam went on to work for many years at a day school in Cartsdyke, her place of birth. After 1751 she turned to domestic labour for the rest of her life. Unable to recapture her fleeting success, Adams died penniless in Town's Hospital, a poorhouse in Glasgow, on 3 April 1765, after it was reported that she had been wandering about in the streets.

Bailey was born at Moors, Alcester, Warwickshire, to William Thomas Bailey, a railway signalman- which influenced his son's interest in the railways- and his wife Ellen Mary (n√©e Taylor).http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/101207Contemporary Authors: vols 5-8, Gale Research Co., 1969, p. 55https://blog.oup.com/2012/09/church-lives- oxford-dictionary-national- biographyhttps://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2012/28-september/features/features/private- lives-made-public He was educated at Alcester Grammar School, then Lincoln Theological College- being ordained as an Anglican priest in 1943- and the University of Edinburgh (Ph.D. 1947).http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/101207The Book of Marriage: The Wisest Answers to the Toughest Questions, ed.

Dr. Derrick Sherwin Bailey (1910-84), a group of clergy, doctors and lawyers studied the existing materials on homosexuality. They then produced a privately printed pamphlet titled The Problem of Homosexuality. This interim report, written by Bailey, signalled the first twentieth-century extended treatment of homosexuality by an ecclesiastical body. Not only did it examine the current medical, psychological, and sociological literature, but it also sought to address the role of the Church of England in the issue of reforming the law. The Moral Welfare Council recognized the role of the State in regulating society, but it also acknowledged that the rights of the homosexual were being violated, and this issue needed to be addressed. :\\"Bailey's writings helped the Church of England to respond to the theological issue of homosexuality, to homosexuals themselves, as well as to the laws of England. This 1954-5 period in the Moral Welfare Council provided important conceptual guidelines for subsequent discussions about homosexuality, not only in the Church of England but throughout Christendom.\\" The report compiled by Bailey for the Church of England's Moral Welfare Council to present to the Wolfenden Committee was actually entitled Sexual Offenders and Social Punishment. While working on the pamphlet, Bailey independently completed Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition. It was criticized for exonerating the Church for persecuting homosexuals, yet it is still considered a landmark work on this topic. He scrutinized both the Bible and subsequent thought, drawing focus to some heretofore ignored issues, such as intertestamental literature, legislation of Christian emperors, the penitentials, and the link between heresy and sodomy. Bailey testified to the Wolfenden Committee in support of the reform of the laws on homosexuality. The historian Patrick Higgins describes some of Bailey's other views an \\"interesting cocktail of beliefs\\". Higgins lists Bailey as believing that homosexuality will eventually disappear \\"because he thought that modern people would create better marriages, which in turn would make better homes, producing children who would naturally follow the right sexual path\\". He also proposed that homosexual men should be invited into the homes of married heterosexuals in order so that the heterosexuals could \\"share some of their joy with them\\". While he believes male homosexuality to be pitied rather than criminalised, Higgins reports that he had little sympathy with lesbians: he considered lesbianism \\"socially more undesirable than male homosexuality\\".

Apel now resides in Gr√§fenroda, and is a member of the SV Eintracht Frankenhain club. Like most German winter sport athletes, Apel is a sport soldier, performing normal soldier duties but released for training and competitions. Apel began her career as a cross country skier; between 1990 and 1994, her best results were third place in the junior World Championships 5 km classic in 1993, and second in the relay also in the junior World Championships, in 1990. However, when Apel failed to qualify for the Olympics in Lillehammer in 1994, she made the decision (along with her friend and then training partner Steffi) to switch to biathlon. Apel began biathlon in 1994 in the European Cup, the second division to the World Cup. In Apel's first season in the World Cup, 1995/96, she placed 33rd, but her results improved from then on. In the 1998/99 season she placed 8th, in 1999/00 10th, 2000/01 12th. The 2001/02 season was her best when she finished the season in 5th place. In that season Apel placed 13th in the individual, 4th in the sprint, 4th in the pursuit, and 12th in the mass start. The year after she could only finish a lowly 20th place. She bounced back to 7th in the 2003/04 season and 8th again in 2004/05, where her best discipline was the pursuit, in which she finished 7th. Apel has had 18 podium finishes in the World Cup. Four wins, five second places and nine third places. All but one of her World Cup wins were in the 2001/02 season when she came 5th in the final standings. Also three of the four wins were in the sprint. Apel is a solid shooter in the prone position, averaging mid 80% over the years, but her standing shoot lets her down, only in the low 70%, though it has improved from mid 60% from a few years ago. Apel has four Olympic medals, two gold, one silver, and one bronze. Her only solo medal is a bronze in the sprint in the 1998 Winter Olympics. She won the other medals in relay events. Apel has ten World Championship medals, four gold, five silver, and one bronze. However only two of the medals are solo medals, one a silver won in Oslo's Holmenkollen ski festival in 2000 in the sprint, and the other, also a silver, won in the mass start in Oberhof in 2004. The remaining medals were won in relays.

Shaver Samuel Perry \\"Powhatan\\" Carter (August 6, 1819 ‚Äì May 26, 1891) was a United States naval officer who served in the Union Army as a brevet major general during the American Civil War and became a rear admiral in the postbellum United States Navy. He was the first and thus far only United States officer to have been commissioned both a general officer and a Naval flag officer. C.f.: Joseph D. Stewart, Major General, (United States Marine Corps) and Vice Admiral (United States Maritime Service), the USMS being a civilian agency. C.f. also: Rear Admiral and Brigadier General Raphael Semmes, Confederate States Navy and Army. Early life and career Carter was born in Elizabethton, Tennessee, the eldest son of Alfred Moore Carter, a direct descendant of the early settlers for whom Carter County is named. His mother was Evalina Belmont Perry. Although later known as Samuel Powhatan Carter, Samuel's middle name was Perry. He had two brothers, William Blount Carter and James Patton Taylor Carter. Samuel Carter attended the Duffield Academy in Elizabethton, Washington College in Limestone, and Princeton University before enlisting in the U.S. Navy in February 1840. Serving as a midshipman, Carter's five years of service included duty in the Pacific and Great Lakes region before transferring to the United States Naval Academy. He graduated in the class of 1846, later seeing action during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War aboard the USS Ohio at the Battle of Veracruz. Stationed at the United States Naval Observatory for several years following the war, Carter became an assistant professor of mathematics at the United States Naval Academy for three years, from 1850 to 1853. After another tour of duty with the Pacific and Brazil Squadrons, he served in various duties before winning promotion to lieutenant in April 1855. The following year, Carter was present aboard the USS San Jacinto during the bombardment of Chinese coastal fortifications before returning to the United States to be appointed to the staff at the U.S. Naval Academy, remaining at this tour of duty until 1860. Civil War A foggy morning at the Pinnacle at Cumberland Gap National Historic Park. In early 1861, after receiving a letter from Carter assuring his loyalty to the Union should a civil war break out, Tennessee senator Andrew Johnson used his influence in the War Department for Carter to be detached from the Navy. Carter was ordered to organize and enlist Unionists within his native East Tennessee, where the majority of the population remained loyal. When Confederate occupation of the region prevented this, Carter raised a brigade of infantry from among the hundreds of East Tennesseans fleeing to Kentucky. During this time he adopted \\"Powhatan\\" as a code name when corresponding secretly with Unionists who remained behind Confederate lines. Carter's younger brother, William B. Carter (1820‚Äì1902), planned and coordinated the East Tennessee bridge-burning conspiracy in late 1861. Carter was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers without resigning from the Navy. He led an infantry brigade at the Battle of Mill Springs on January 19, 1862, and participated in operations under Brigadier General George W. Morgan that resulted in the occupation of Cumberland Gap on June 17, 1862. Carter's hope that Morgan would then invade and occupy East Tennessee was dashed when Morgan was forced to retreat in the face of a Confederate move into Kentucky‚ÄîBraxton Bragg's Perryville Campaign. Following Bragg's defeat and retreat to Middle Tennessee, Carter successfully lobbied his superiors for permission to conduct a raid into East Tennessee. Carter's plan was to cripple the vital East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad. This would support the operations of Major General William S. Rosecrans in Middle Tennessee, and test the route through the mountains as a potential path of invasion. The result was the first long-range, large-scale Federal cavalry raid of the war. With a force of just under 1,000 men Carter moved through the rugged mountains of eastern Kentucky and Tennessee during the last week of 1862. On December 30 he destroyed railroad and wagon bridges at both Union and Carter's Depot (present day Watauga), Tennessee. He repeatedly defeated the Confederate forces in his path, captured a moving train, destroyed tens of thousands of dollars of military stores, and returned safely to Kentucky on January 2, 1863. Plans to follow the raid with an invasion and occupation of East Tennessee, a move urged by Lincoln, were canceled when Carter reported the route impracticable for a large force. In July 1863, Carter was placed in command of the XXIII Corps cavalry division and continued campaigning across Tennessee throughout the year, engaging Confederate forces during the Battle of Blue Springs of the Knoxville Campaign. By 1865, Carter was in North Carolina and commanding the left wing of the Union forces at the Battle of Wyse Fork. He was promoted to brevet major general of volunteers on March 13, 1865,Eicher, p. 167. briefly commanding the XXIII Corps before being mustered out of volunteer service in January 1866. While Carter was serving in the Union Army, the U.S. Navy promoted him to lieutenant commander in 1863, then to commander in 1865. Postbellum career USS Monocacy (1864) Returning to naval service, Carter was appointed a commander due to his military record during the Civil War. Rejoining the Pacific Squadron, he commanded the USS Monocacy. He was promoted to captain in October 1870, served as commandant of midshipman in the Naval Academy until 1873, and returned to sea duty in Europe before being named a member of the Lighthouse Board in 1877. After the Civil War, Carter became a Veteran Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS), a military society composed of Union officers and their descendants. In 1877, Carter married Martha Custis Williams (1827‚Äì1899), a descendant of Martha Custis Washington. Promoted to commodore in November 1878, Carter retired in August 1881, shortly before being promoted to rear admiral on the retired list in May 1882. He lived in retirement until his death in Washington, D.C. Carter is buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery. Fellow officers remembered Carter as \\"tall, handsome and dignified, graceful in carriage and very affable ... a 'soldierly Christian' of sincere piety and undoubted courage.\\" A Tennessee Historical Marker located on West Elk Avenue in front of the S.

At the Grandes √©coles and later when it transformed into the University of Belgrade he taught chemistry and electrosynthesis. Early years and education Simeon Lozaniƒá was born February 24, 1847 in Belgrade, Serbia. He completed legal studies in Belgrade, studied chemistry under Professor Johannes Wislicenus in Z√ºrich and later with Professor August Wilhelm von Hofmann in Berlin. He earned his doctorate degree on March 19, 1870 at the University of Zurich. He was a professor at the \\"Great School\\" from 1872 and at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy until 1924. Career When the University of Belgrade was founded in 1905, he was among the first eight full-time professors who selected the entire remaining academic staff. Sima Lozaniƒá was then chosen as the first rector of the university. His 1905 opening ceremony words remained recorded as the following: Portrait of Sima Lozaniƒá by Uro≈° Prediƒá :\\"Our previous belief that Serbian people will unite not by spelling books but by weapons was disastrous for our people's intellect. I believe the contrary - that education will be the main factor in solving that important question of ours and that it would have already been solved if we had better cared for our education. Therefore, I believe that education is the force that achieves all the goals. Had our education been more advanced, everything in the life of our people would have been better and more successful.\\" His chemistry classes paralleled, perhaps exceeded in some cases, those of the top European universities. They were organized with well- equipped laboratories and libraries, and produced some of the first chemistry textbooks. Lozaniƒá himself wrote a number of textbooks, which covered various subject areas of chemistry: Inorganic chemistry, Organic chemistry, Analytical chemistry and Chemical technology. His textbooks were internationally renowned and in some areas groundbreaking. For example, Lozaniƒá's Inorganic Chemistry textbook was the first European university textbook with Dmitriy Mendeleyev's periodic table of elements and one of the first containing a chapter on Thermochemistry. His Organic Chemistry textbooks are among the first books in which the compounds were represented by structural formulas. He also did scientific and professional work related to all areas of Chemistry; some of his most valued works were about electrosynthesis in which he researched the reactions of CO and CO2 with other substances under the effect of electric discharge. He published over 200 scientific papers in applied and experimental chemistry. Lozaniƒá performed the first analysis of thermal water of Gamzigrad spa in 1889. He became a member of the Serbian Learned Society (Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) on January 30, 1873, associate member of Serbian Royal Academy on January 23, 1888 and became a full member on January 6, 1890. He was a president of Serbian Royal Academy twice - 1899 to 1900 and 1903 to 1906. From 1907 to 1912 he was a president of Serbian Chemistry Society. He was the minister of industry from January 12, 1894 to March 21, 1894, and October 15, 1894 to June 25, 1895 and October 11, 1897 to June 30, 1899, minister of foreign affairs from March 21, 1894 to October 15, 1894 and from December 23, 1902 to March 23, 1903, as well as a diplomat and participant in all wars of the time. Lozaniƒá was the ambassador of the Serbian government in London from 1900. He was a president of Serbian refugee aid committee in 1916 and a head of US mission for aid and support of Serbia from 1917. He was the first honorary doctor of sciences of the University of Belgrade. He died July 7, 1935 in Belgrade, in the age of 89. His son Milivoje S. Lozaniƒá was also a chemist and inherited his university position as the professor of Chemistry. Sima's two daughters, Ana Lozaniƒá Marinkoviƒá (1882-1973) became a well-known painter and Jelena Lozaniƒá who, like her father, affirmed in humanitarian work and in the battle for women's rights, participated in international congresses in the United States in 1915 as a Serbian Red Cross delegate to enlist aid for her war desolated country. Since the war continued in Serbia, she stayed in America until the year 1920, when she married John Frothingham, the great benefactor to Serbian people. Together with Michael Pupin, Mr. and Mrs. John Frothingham contributed greatly in delivering humanitarian aid. Legacy An exhibition \\"Sima Lozaniƒá in Serbian science and culture\\" was held in his honor, organized by Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts from January to March 1993, in Academy's gallery in Knez Mihailova street in Belgrade. His life and work was especially investigated by chemist Sne≈æana Bojoviƒá, who wrote a 262-page book Sima Lozaniƒá. He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs. A street in Dedinje is named after him. He was decorated Order of St. Sava I and III degree, Order of the Cross of Takovo, Order of Milo≈° the Great III degree, Silver medal for bravery, Commemorative war medal, Order of the Redeemer I degree, Order of Orange-Nassau I degree, Order of Osmanieh I degree, Order of the crown of Romania I degree.

It is published on Mondays and Thursdays during university semesters by the Purdue Student Publishing Foundation, and is Indiana's largest collegiate daily newspaper. The Exponent employs seven full-time professionals, relying for most operations on a staff of approximately 80 students, though the university has no journalism school. Exponent alumni have won six Pulitzers, six Emmys, two Peabodys, and two John Chancellors. History The Exponent's first edition was published on December 15, 1889. It was a daily paper from 1906 to 2016. In 2017, it switched to a twice-weekly printing schedule. The Web edition (www.purdueexponent.org) was started in 1996. It was the first college newspaper in the country to build its own building (built in 1989 and sold in 2017, but the organization still resides there) and one of two college newspapers that continues to own its own press. The path to becoming an independent entity began in 1968, when the university removed William R. Smoot II as editor-in-chief. The move followed critical and controversial columns in the newspaper, particularly one on October 23, 1968, that castigated university president Frederick L. Hovde. The university informed Smoot on Friday, Nov. 8, 1968, that he was being removed, but the sixteen editors on the staff refused to accept the dictum. On Saturday, it put out a special edition with a headline, ‚ÄúWe Will Still Publish.‚Äù By Monday, the headline was more defiant: ‚ÄúSmoot Will Continue: Staff‚Äù. University officials claimed that alumni and political pressure had nothing to do with the move to remove Smoot, but Thomas Graham, a Purdue trustee later said, ‚ÄúNot only did I get a whole bunch of letters, I‚Äôd go down to cash a check at the bank and an old friend would grab (me) by the front of the shirt and tell (me), ‚ÄòNow dammit, you know right from wrong. Now go up there and get those liberals out of that university.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done here in southern Indiana.‚Äù The firing of the editor pushed to the fore the issue of who owned and who was responsible for oversight of the student newspaper. The issue was given to a faculty- student-administrator committee called the Exponent Review Board, but known as the Osmun Commission for its chairman, the late Dr. John Osmun. Ultimately the Osmun Commission decided over the opposition of administration members that while Hovde had the authority to fire Smoot, the university did not follow due process. Smoot was allowed to remain as editor-in-chief. More important in the long term, the commission recommended that the Exponent become a not-for- profit corporation headed by a publishing board, the Purdue Student Publishing Foundation. Its rent-free use that had been in place since 1933 of windowless offices in the basement (Room B-50) of the Purdue Memorial Union would end in 1969 and the organization paid rent to the University until moving out in May 1989. In 1975, at the urging of then Purdue President Arthur Hansen, the Exponent became free distribution with 10,000 copies distributed on campus. Recent operations The newspaper struggled through the first several years of organization, partly because it was capitalized only by operating revenues and partly because it was being forced to rent space from the university and to purchase printing equipment that had already been paid for. It went through a period of alternately making and losing money, though student staff members were all volunteers at that time. A critical point came in 1975 when the newspaper went to free campus-wide circulation, expanding market coverage and gaining dramatic advertising increases. By 1988, revenues had grown substantially and the newspaper began construction on a facility that it occupies, but no longer owns, at 460 Northwestern Ave., West Lafayette. The newspaper today distributes 9,000 copies twice-weekly during the school year and 6,000 during the summer. Revenues are nearly $1 million per year. The Exponent is only one of two college newspapers that own and operate their own printing press.

Obstructions such as this metal post and stubs of limbs can be engulfed. In botany, secondary growth is the growth that results from cell division in the cambia or lateral meristems and that causes the stems and roots to thicken, while primary growth is growth that occurs as a result of cell division at the tips of stems and roots, causing them to elongate, and gives rise to primary tissue. Secondary growth occurs in most seed plants, but monocots usually lack secondary growth. If they do have secondary growth, it differs from the typical pattern of other seed plants. The formation of secondary vascular tissues from the cambium is a characteristic feature of dicotyledons and gymnosperms. In certain monocots, the vascular tissues are also increased after the primary growth is completed but the cambium of these plants is of a different nature. In the living Pteridophytes this feature is rare but occurs in plants like Isoetes and Botrychium. Lateral meristems Diagram of secondary growth in a tree showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections. New wood is added in each growth season by the lateral meristems, the cork cambium and vascular cambium. In many vascular plants, secondary growth is the result of the activity of the two lateral meristems, the cork cambium and vascular cambium. Arising from lateral meristems, secondary growth increases the growth of the plant root or stem, rather than its length. As long as the lateral meristems continue to produce new cells, the stem or root will continue to grow in diameter. In woody plants, this process produces wood, and shapes the plant into a tree with a thickened trunk. Because this growth usually ruptures the epidermis of the stem or roots, plants with secondary growth usually also develop a cork cambium. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. If this is kept up over many years, this process may produce a layer of cork. In the case of the cork oak it will yield harvestable cork. In nonwoody plants Secondary growth also occurs in many nonwoody plants, e.g. tomato,Thompson, N.P. and Heimsch, C. 1964. Stem anatomy and aspects of development in tomato. American Journal of Botany 51: 7-19. potato tuber, carrot taproot and sweet potato tuberous root. A few long-lived leaves also have secondary growth.Ewers, F.W. 1982. Secondary growth in needle leaves of Pinus longaeva (bristlecone pine) and other conifers: Quantitative data. American Journal of Botany 69: 1552-1559. Abnormal secondary growth Palms (in the picture Roystonea regia palm) increase their trunk diameter by means of division and enlargement of parenchyma tissue, without a real secondary growth (production of secondary vascular strands‚Äîsecondary xylem and phloem tissues‚Äîwith the consequent enlargement of the canopy and root system).James D. Mauseth, 2003. Botany: An Introduction to Plant Biology, Third Edition. Abnormal secondary growth does not follow the pattern of a single vascular cambium producing xylem to the inside and phloem to the outside as in ancestral lignophytes. Some dicots have anomalous secondary growth, e.g. in Bougainvillea a series of cambia arise outside the oldest phloem.Esau, K. and Cheadle, V.I. 1969. Secondary growth in bougainvillea. Annals of Botany 33: 807-819. Ancestral monocots lost their secondary growth and their stele has changed in a way it could not be recovered without major changes that are very unlikely to occur. Monocots either have no secondary growth, as is the ancestral case, or they have an \\"anomalous secondary growth\\" of some type, or, in the case of palms, they enlarge their diameter in what is called a sort of secondary growth or not depending on the definition given to the term. Palm trees increase their trunk diameter due to division and enlargement of parenchyma cells, which is termed \\"primary gigantism\\" because there is no production of secondary xylem and phloem tissues,MG Simpson (2005) \\"Arecaceae (Palmae)\\" In: Plant Systematics. p.185: \\"...Plant sex is variable, and secondary growth is absent...\\" or sometimes \\"diffuse secondary growth\\".Esau, K. 1977. Anatomy of Seed Plants. New York: Wiley In some other monocot stems as in Yucca and Dracaena with anomalous secondary growth, a cambium forms, but it produces vascular bundles and parenchyma internally and just parenchyma externally. Some monocot stems increase in diameter due to the activity of a primary thickening meristem, which is derived from the apical meristem.

He was a ropemaker, author, and watercolour painter. Life Crawhall, like his father (also Joseph), a Newcastle ropemaker, was interested in writing and watercolour painting. He went on to produce many books, illustrated by himself. His first (printed by himself in 1859) was entitled The Compleatest Angling Booke That Ever was Writ. The second edition (printed in 1881) contained illustrations from his son, Joseph Crawhall and James Guthrie (1859‚Äì1930). Crawhall was a friend of Charles Keene (1823‚Äì1891), illustrator of Punch, and they worked together for over 200 drawings for the journal. There are 21 albums of these drawings in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. Joseph Crawhall II was a man of many talents. As well as a wood engraver and writer, he was a businessman, patron of the arts, campaigner for the preservation of architecture, collaborator of Charles Keene, book designer, collector of antiquities, and keen angler, as well as becoming secretary of the Newcastle Arts Association in 1880. Fully absorbed in the life of a thriving and productive city, he made a significant contribution to Newcastle in every area of interest that he pursued. In his role as a collector of antiquities he published A Beuk o‚Äô Newcassell Sangs Collected by Joseph Crawhall in 1888. It too was a pictorial book, giving in this case, the lyrics of the songs, in many cases the actual music, and all beautifully illustrated using his woodcuts. Crawhall's A pictorial archive of quaint cuts in the chap book style was published by Dover Press (now long out of print) is a collection of woodcuts. Family His grandfather Thomas had married his grandmother Ann (n√©e Bownas) at Allendale in 1771. They lived at Allendale, where Thomas was chief agent for Beaumonts lead mines, and there they raised twelve children. His father, Joseph I (1793‚Äì1853) was an artist as well as a respected Newcastle business man, and an artist. His brother George Edward and sister Mary also showed artistic talent. Another sister Jane Anne was the mother of Abel Chapman, the naturalist writer and artist. He was the father of Joseph Crawhall III.

It offers retail trading of binary options and spreads on the most heavily traded forex, commodities and stock indices markets. History Nadex originally was known as \\"HedgeStreet\\" and was based in San Mateo, California. The Exchange was launched in 2004 offering an electronic marketplace that offered trading in financial derivatives to retail investors. HedgeStreet shut down its business in late 2007. Shortly thereafter, UK-based IG Group Holdings plc. agreed to purchase HedgeStreet, Inc. for $6 million and began restructuring the exchange, its technology, and its products. In 2009 HedgeStreet was renamed as the North American Derivatives Exchange (Nadex). HedgeStreet was the first Internet-based event futures/derivatives exchange to be regulated in the US by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The company operates the HedgeStreet Exchange, which launched in October 2004 and provides traders with a place where they can hedge against or speculate on economic events and price movements. The reasoning behind the creation of HedgeStreet was that with the rise of individual private investment in stocks, there might be a similar appetite for individuals to invest in derivatives. This focus on small investors created sufficient confusion that John Nafeh, founder of HedgeStreet, created the term \\"hedgelet\\" to help explain the company's business model. In 2007, UK based IG Group announced intent to acquire HedgeStreet and later in the year completed the purchase of the company. Subsequent to the purchase, Nadex began to offer binary options similar to those already available on IG's platform. Operations =Products= Nadex binary option and spread contracts span a range of underlying markets, from commodity futures and spot forex rates to economic indicators and equity index futures. Contracts are available for a wide range of strike prices with intraday, daily and weekly expirations. =Regulations= Nadex is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Unlike many binary options providers, Nadex does not take the other side of member trades or engage in trading of any kind. Member funds are held in segregated accounts in US banks. =Membership= Individuals can become members to trade directly on the exchange with access to a trading platform including order entry, market depth, historical data services, cash accounting and position reporting. Membership is free, and members can trade with a minimum $250 initial deposit. =Funding= Nadex requires traders to fund the maximum risk of any trade before the position can be opened. Trades are not done on margin and do not involve leverage. Because all trades are fully funded at the outset, Nadex does not issue margin calls. Furthermore, no matter how far the market goes against a trader's position, the trader is not stopped out. For spreads with a wide floor/ceiling range, the underlying market will generally be trading between the floor and ceiling values. In the case of spreads with a narrow floor/ceiling range, the closeness of the floor and ceiling levels means that the underlying market might be trading near (or outside) these levels. =Fees= Members pay trading fees on each side of their trades: once to open and once to close. The fee for each contract is $1.00 with a maximum charge of $50 per order. For trades that expire in the money (and thus receive a payout), the trading fee is replaced by a $1.00 settlement fee per contract. Nadex does not charge settlement fees on trades that settle out of the money.

It is geographically the second largest of the 17 Wards of New Orleans, after the 9th Ward. New Orleans Districts and Wards Boundaries and geography The 7th Ward stretches from the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain. The eastern, or \\"lower\\" boundary is Elysian Fields Avenue, the boundary with the 8th Ward. In the \\"up-river\\" direction to the south-west, the boundary is Esplanade Avenue, the border with the 6th Ward; then from where Esplanade meets Bayou St. John the boundary follows the bayou north to the lake, with the 5th Ward being across the bayou. Features and landmarks The London Avenue Canal runs through the ward from just in from Gentilly Ridge to the Lake. Dillard University is in the Ward, as is most of the University of New Orleans campus near the lakefront. The New Orleans Fairgrounds, home to horse racing and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, is just back from Esplanade Avenue, as is Saint Louis Cemetery #3. Frenchmen Street, the popular destination for food and live music, is in the front of the ward near the French Quarter. History As with most of New Orleans, the area along the high ground of the riverfront was developed first; this area is today the Marigny Triangle of the Faubourg Marigny. The Pontchartrain Railroad, the first US railroad away from the Atlantic coast, ran for a century along Elysian Fields between the Riverfront and the famous camps at Milneburg. The area is known for the Creole citizens who once heavily populated the area. Esplanade Ridge between Rampart and Bayou St. John was one of the first parts of town substantially developed away from the riverfront. Some of the elegant early 19th century Creole-style mansions can still be seen along Esplanade. The areas between Gentilly Ridge and the Lakefront was developed in the 20th century with improved drainage; see Drainage in New Orleans. Ruined house in flood silt near the London Avenue Canal after the Hurricane Katrina levee failure disaster When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, the effects were disastrous. The London Avenue Canal breached catastrophically on both sides, flooding the majority of the Ward and the surrounding area. The 7th ward has since seen many residents return. Famous 7th Ward New Orleanians Notable people from the 7th Ward include artists Charlie Johnson, Louise Mouton, John Scott, Richard C. Thomas; jazz musicians/composers Joe Jones, Lionel Ferbos, Jelly Roll Morton, director, actor Vernel Bagneris, Barney Bigard, and Sidney Bechet, Allen Toussaint, singer Lee Dorsey, singer Lizzie Miles, Jazz singers Germaine Bazzle, Sharon Martin; actor Anthony Mackie, rapper/producer Mannie Fresh, rapper Mia X, author/commentator Melissa Harris-Perry, civil rights leader A.

Huipil (from the Nahuatl word huƒ´pƒ´lli ) is the most common traditional garment worn by indigenous women from central Mexico to Central America. It is a loose-fitting tunic, generally made from two or three rectangular pieces of fabric, which are then joined together with stitching, ribbons or fabric strips, with an opening for the head and, if the sides are sewn, openings for the arms. Traditional huipils, especially ceremonial ones, are usually made with fabric woven on a backstrap loom and are heavily decorated with designs woven into the fabric, embroidery, ribbons, lace and more. However, some huipils are also made from commercial fabric. Lengths of the huipil can vary from a short blouse-like garment or long enough to reach the floor. The style of traditional huipils generally indicates the ethnicity and community of the wearer as each have their own methods of creating the fabric and decorations. Some huipils have intricate and meaningful designs. Ceremonial huipils are the most elaborate and are reserved for weddings, burials, women of high rank and even to dress the statues of saints. The huipil has been worn by indigenous women of the Mesoamerican region (central Mexico into Central America) of both high and low social rank since well before the arrival of the Spanish to the Americas. It remains the most common female indigenous garment still in use. It is most often seen in the Mexican states of Chiapas, Yucat√°n, Quintana Roo, Oaxaca, Tabasco, Campeche, Hidalgo, Michoac√°n (where it is called a huanengo), Veracruz and Morelos . In Central America it is most often used among the Mayas in Guatemala. Cuetzalan, Puebla has an annual coffee and huipil festival called the Feria del Huipil y Caf√©, which began in 1949. History The \\"La Malinche\\" huipil Huipil, 1875-1890, Warp-faced plain weave cotton, Patzun, Guatemala (probably) V&A; Museum no.T.23-1931 After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and subsequent Spanish expansion, the huipil endured but it evolved, incorporating elements from other regions and Europe. One of the oldest known huipils in existence is the \\"La Malinche\\", named such because it was believed to have been worn by Hern√°n Cort√©s‚Äô interpreter as it looks much like ones in depictions of her in the Lienzo de Tlaxcala and the Florentine Codex. However, carbon 14 tests date it to the 18th century. It is exceptional not only for its age but there is none like it in any collection and it is larger than usual at 120 by 140 cm. It is made of cotton with feathers, wax and gold thread. The design is dominated by an image of a double headed eagle, showing both indigenous and Spanish influence. It is part of the collection of the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a. Some huipils, such as those from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec show Asian influence due to cloth brought from the Philippines . In addition, the huipil began to be worn with other garments, especially European skirts, during the colonial period. This led to changes in the garment itself and how it was used. In some cases, the huipil became shorter, to function as a kind of blouse rather than a dress. In the same region, the huipil also evolved into a long flowing and sometimes voluminous head covering which frames the face. To this day, the most traditional huipils are made with hand woven cloth on a back strap loom. However, the introduction of commercial fabric made this costly and many indigenous women stopped making this fabric, or making simpler versions. By the early 1800s, women began to wear undecorated huipils or European style blouses. By the end of the 19th century, most Maya women had forgotten the technique of brocade weaving entirely. The huipil endures in many indigenous communities, if not as an everyday garment, as one for ceremonies or special occasions. When a woman puts on a huipil, especially a ceremonial or very traditional one, it is a kind of ritual. She becomes the center of a symbolic world as her head passes through the neck opening. With her arms, she forms a cross and is surrounded by myth as between heaven and the underworld. Creation Four huipils for a figure of the Virgin of the Rosary; Guatemala, Guatemala, San Juan Sacatepequez; Kakchiquel Maya people; 1930s; cotton and silk (Dallas Museum of Art) Stitching together two panels in Xochistlahuaca The huipil is a tunic- like garment made by stitching together anywhere from one to five pieces of cloth. The most common fiber is cotton, but there are those made from wool and silk as well. Most huipils are made from two or three pieces, which are usually the same size, with one exception being those from the highlands of Chiapas, where the center piece is wider than the side ones. The panels are not sewn together in the normal sense with seams but rather they are joined using ribbons, small strips of cloth or complicated stitching which has the edges of the panels touching or almost touching. This adds a layer of decoration to the garment. Maya. Woman's Blouse or Huipil, Brooklyn Museum Most classic huipils are wider than they are long although there has been a reduction in width in recent years. Huipils can be as short as waist length or can reach to the ankles or anywhere in between, but most fall just above or just below the knee. Long or short, it is not designed to be a close-fitting garment. The neckline can be round, oval, square or a simple slit. Most are sewn on the sides, leaving an opening in the upper part for the arms to pass through. Some huipils are not sewn on the sides, especially the very short ones. While huipils today are made from commercial cloth, the most traditional are made from hand woven fabric made on a backstrap loom. The pieces to be used to make the huipil are woven to size and are never cut. Despite its simplicity, the backstrap loom permits more types of techniques and designs to be woven into the cloth than other types of looms. Most of the hand woven fabric have designs woven into them, especially cloth destined for ceremonial huipils. The decorative elements can signify history, cultural identity, something personal about the wearer and more. Since most indigenous come from agricultural societies, clothing designs generally relate to the natural world. The most complicated designs are generally known only to a few older master weavers. In addition to designs embedded into the fabric, other decorative elements can include embroidery, ribbon, feathers, lace and more. The making of traditional huipils is an important cultural and economic activity for the Amuzgos, especially in Xochistlahuaca where most people still wear traditional clothing. Girls begin learning the craft when they are young, learning techniques and designs from their mothers and grandmothers. The weaving is an important source of income as agriculture is not enough to meet most families‚Äô needs. While they work on other items such as tablecloths and other items of clothing, the most popular and most valued remains the huipil. Amuzgo women have achieved a certain level of fame, with weavers such as Florentina L√≥pez de Jes√∫s winning recognition at the 2001 UNESCO handcraft competition for Latin America and Caribbean. Variations Huipils on sale at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico CityHuipils of the Tlapanec people c. 1908 Traditional huipils generally identify the indigenous group and a community of the wearer as each has its own designs for both weaving and embroidering. Some communities, such as Jamiltepec in Oaxaca, have a taboo against huipils made there being worn by women from other areas. Except for very long huipils, they are generally worn with other items of clothing such as a skirt or slip. Most huipils hang loose but some can be tied at the waist or can be tucked into a skirt like a blouse. In some cases, such as in San Juan Copala, Oaxaca, the extra length of the huipil is rolled up onto the waist when worn with a skirt. Women commonly have an everyday huipil and those worn only on special occasions such as weddings. Decorative elements are often arranged in horizontal bands but those with vertical orientation are found as well. In a number of indigenous communities, extravagant huipils made for a woman's wedding is then carefully put away and stored to be used later for her funeral. In others, a special huipil is begun when a woman reaches a certain age for this purpose. Ceremonial huipils are also made to dress images of saints. During festivals, these saints can be dressed in many layers of huipils, giving them a fattened appearance. The garment is common among the various Mayan groups. For Mayan women in Guatemala, huipil designs on the front back and shoulders can identify which type of Maya and from what community. Mayan ceremonial huipils are worn only by the statues of saints and the wives of religious officials. Chinanteca huipils are elaborate with the entire garment covered in woven and embroidered geometric designs in various colors, with the edges further decorated with ribbons. In Ojitl√°n, Oaxaca, Chinanteca women wear special huipils for their wedding, divided into three classes. The first is called ‚Äúgala‚Äù or ‚Äúred‚Äù which used to be the traditional wedding dress. However, because of its cost, few families can afford it. The second type is called ‚Äúpavo‚Äù which is used for special occasions. It is similar to the first but with a less intense red and with smaller designs. The third type, called ‚Äúp√°jaros y palomas‚Äù (birds and doves) is the most economical of the three and can be found fairly easily in markets. It is white with figures of birds and other animals in vivid and contrasting colors. This used to be reserved for women of middle age or older but it has since been adopted by many. The indigenous women of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec are known for wearing two huipils. The first is a short velvet huipil which is heavily embroidered with floral motifs and a second one for special occasions, usually white, which frames the face then extends over the head covering the neck and shoulders. The blouse huipil has a length of only about 60 cm and shows modern, European and even Asian influence and is generally worn with a voluminous European style skirt which is also heavily decorated. The head covering is called a ‚Äúhuipil de tapar‚Äù (covering huipil) or a bidaniro. The huipils of Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena, Chiapas are rich in symbolism with images of gods, flowers, frogs and other images with mythological importance. It also includes a set of symbols which serve as a kind of signature of the weaver. The ceremonial huipil of Magdalenas has designs that represent the universe in the form of a cross with east represented on the right shoulder and west on the left. The south is represented on the chest and north on the back. Upon dressing, the woman becomes the center of the universe. This huipil is used only by women of the highest social rank and it is also used to dress statues of saints. Amuzgo huipils are made with brocade fabric. Amuzgo huipils have a sophisticated set of designs based on animals, plants, geometric shapes and more. Some of the designs are not obvious, such as the use of two connected triangles to represent butterflies, but all have a particular significance. The ceremonial huipil of Zinacant√°n, Chiapas is also distinguished by its manufacture and symbolism. It is made of white cotton with a square neckline or with a vertical opening with a button fastener. The chest area is marked off with a red line inside of which are white chicken feathers delicately fastened with white, blue or green thread. The lower border has fringe made of the same materials and colors. It is the only garment in Mexico which uses the pre Hispanic art of featherwork today. This huipil is often used for weddings as it is believed that it ensures a good marriage. Other white wedding huipils are found in Pinotepa Nacional, Chopan and Cotzoc√≥n in Oaxaca. In Pinotepa Nacional, decorative elements include animals, flowers, human figures, fretwork, moons, suns, fish and insects. The ceremonial huipils of the Tzotzils have maintained aspects of pre Hispanic feather art with white feathers found on the chest and lower hem. In Ocotepec and Cuquila in Oaxaca, which are high in the Mixtec mountains, there are huipils made of wool to combat the cold with cotton ones usually for festive occasions. Yalaltec huipils in Oaxaca are very simple with decoration only on a chest and back panel with various colors and some fringe.

It caters to both Quaker and non-Quaker children between the ages of 9‚Äì14, organizing them by age into \\"units,\\" or groups of campers who share cabins and go on trips together. During their time at camp ‚Äî two to four weeks ‚Äî children are taught Quaker values of simplicity, equality, and peace, and the benefits of living in an intentional, child-centered, loving community. Each session consists of eight days in-camp alongside two three-day trips, which often take the forms of canoeing, backpacking, rock climbing, tubing, or participating in various other outdoor activities. Oldest campers participate in a ten-day-long trip, aptly named \\"The Ten Day\\", which is a journey into the mountains of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. In-camp activities include swimming in the lagoon (nicknamed the \\"goon\\"), arts and crafts, chores, games, sports, Quaker worship at the fire circle, singing, and other arts activities. The camp property, owned by Baltimore Yearly Meeting since the mid-1950s, is protected by a conservation easement with the state of Maryland. It is home to several rare plant species as well as geological rarities such as Catoctin Greenstone, which can be found in the walls of the main lodge. The large preserved beams and rafters of the lodge are made from American Chestnut trunks formed before the chestnut blight. Baltimore Yearly Meeting has been operating summer camps in the region since the 1920s.

Performances focus on the nuances of air travel, identifying the individual quirks of some of the biggest international airlines and their media stereotypes. The character of Pam Ann has developed a cult-like following. The name Pam Ann is a play on words from Pan Am. In her shows, she refers to the so-called memories of the \\"Golden Age of Aviation\\" (for her, the period between the late 1950s and early 1970s when the jet airplanes entered widespread use), often contrasting it with modern times, and visual/social changes like the lack of knives and glass on board. Overall, it's observational comedy of airlines using her own extensive travel experiences. Pam Ann has been featured in an advertising campaign for British Airways with over 1.25m views in a six-week period. Qantas had Pam Ann's Live DVD ‚ÄòCome Fly with Me‚Äô in their in-flight programming.

The Festival was started in 2001 by then-Brown juniors David Peck and Justin Slosky in collaboration with students of the other seven Ivy League schools. The founders' goal was to create a venue to showcase and honor the work of talented student filmmakers. Ivy Film Festival currently accepts submissions from around the world for both its short film and screenplay competitions. In addition to student film screenings, the Festival hosts advanced screenings of commercial and independent features as well as discussion panels, academic workshops, and keynote addresses with industry guests, who attend the Festival to engage in wide-ranging discussions about film and the entertainment industry. Subjects addressed at festival events have included the relationship between film and social justice, how one can achieve success in the entertainment industry, and the merits of attending film school. Past attendees of Ivy Film Festival include well-known film directors, screenwriters, and actors, such as Jack Nicholson, Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, Tim Robbins, Lena Dunham, Adrien Brody, Aaron Sorkin, James Franco, Wes Craven, Philip Glass, Mira Nair, Chan-wook Park, Doug Liman, John Cho, Kal Penn, Davis Guggenheim, Dylan Kidd, James Toback, John Hamburg, Julia Stiles, Laura Linney, and Michael Showalter.

It was the first blatantly anti-Nazi film to be produced by a major Hollywood studio. The film stars Edward G. Robinson, Francis Lederer, George Sanders, Paul Lukas, and a large cast of German actors, including some who had emigrated from their country after the rise of Adolf Hitler. Many of the German actors who appeared in the film changed their names for fear of reprisals against relatives still living in Germany. Plot Scotland, 1937 The postman asks Mrs. MacLaughlin to save him stamps from the letters she receives from all over the world. MacLaughlin forwards the contents of one envelope to Dr. Karl Kassel in New York City. Cut to Kassel (Paul Lukas), at the Caf√© Nuremberg, haranguing an audience of German Americans. Most of the men wear the uniform of the German American Bund. He informs them that the F√ºhrer has declared war on the evils of democracy and that, as Germans, they should carry out his wishes and claim power. The crowd salutes, Sieg Heil! Kurt Schneider (Francis Lederer), an unemployed malcontent, is inspired to become a spy and writes to Hitler's personal newspaper. German Naval Intelligence know he is not a double agent: The Americans don't have a counter-espionage system. Naval officer Franz Schlager, sailing to New York on the steamship Bismarck, is ordered to contact Schneider. On board the Bismarck, we see the power of the Gestapo. Beauty operator Hilda Kleinhauer (Dorothy Tree) informs on her clients and carries material for Schlager. An unnamed American Legionaire (Ward Bond) challenges Kessel at a meeting. He and others speaking out for democracy are attacked. Schneider boasts to his pal Werner (Joe Sawyer), now a private in the Air Corps, that he receives instructions from Hitler. Werner gets the Z code and Schneider obtains medical records that will reveal troop strength in New York. Schneider proudly gives Schlager the information and receives $50 a month, Mrs. MacLaughlin's address, and a list of new objectives. Kessel is called back to Germany and takes his mistress, Erika Wolff (Lya Lys), leaving his wife behind. The narrator provides a dramatic description of the fascist system of life. Kessel is put in charge of all Nazi activities in the United States. Under the slogan, ‚ÄúAmerica for Americans,‚Äú the country is swamped by propaganda while spies target military operations. Thanks to the postman's curiosity, Mrs. MacLaughlin's role as a post office for a worldwide network of spies is uncovered by British Military Intelligence, and she is arrested. (In a moment that is chilling in hindsight, one letter is from Japan.) American military intelligence in New York consists of Major Williams and one assistant. Williams turns to the FBI for help, although they have never played this role before. FBI Agent Ed Renard (Edward G. Robinson) takes the case. A horrifying scene shows Camp Horst Wessel, where German-American children are trained in Nazi ideals and military skills. Schneider uses an alias, Mitchell, to obtain passports. He arouses suspicion, and the FBI follow the package and arrest him. Once they know his true identity, they realize that they have the letter he sent to MacLaughlin. Renard flatters his ego for hours, extracting a full, detailed confession. Through Schneider, Renard finds Wenz, Kleinhauer and Kassel. Kassel proudly shows Renard his files on important Americans, documenting racial impurity. He tries to burn the code key, but Renard stops him. Renard confronts him with Kleinhauer, who confirms his link with Schlager. When Renard reveals that he knows about Erika, Kassel tells Renard everything he knows about the German spy organization, revealing the intricacy and scope of the network. He is released. The Gestapo are waiting. He swears that he revealed nothing, but they are arrested outside his apartment building. A federal dragnet captures many agents and their accomplices. On March 13, 1938, Hitler invades Austria. Renard warns Kassell's wife that the Gestapo men have made bail. Karl returns home from meeting Erika and lies to his wife. He packs, refusing to take her with him. She does not warn him, and when he goes out, the Gestapo capture him and take him to the Bismarck. In Germany, he is told to claim that he was tortured. In New York, Hilda is given the same instructions. Eighteen people are indicted. Four are in custody: Schneider, Wenz, Kleinhauer and Helldorf. Meanwhile, Hitler's march continues, as ‚Äúthe democracies are given still another demonstration of the supremacy of organized propaganda backed by force.‚Äù U.S. Attorney Kellogg describes the role of fifth columnists in the Nazi conquest of Europe, calling for the United States to take a lesson. After a long trial, the spies are convicted. Over coffee, Kellogg and Renard talk about the ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù. Kellogg observes that ‚Äúwhen our basic liberties are threatened, we wake up.‚Äù The closing credits roll to ‚ÄúAmerica the Beautiful‚Äù.

Guenther Gustave Maria Rumrich was arrested on February 14, 1938, and charged with spying for Germany. He came to the FBI's attention when he attempted to obtain 50 passport application forms from the Passport Office in New York City. In the film, Francis Lederer, as Schneider, plays the role equivalent to the real Rumrich. The scene where an unnamed American Legionaire played by Ward Bond challenges Kessel at a meeting, is supported by others speaking out for democracy, provoking an attack by Bundists, is based on an actual event that occurred in late April 1938. when approximately 30 World War I American Legion Veterans stood up to the Bund in New York City during a celebration of Hitler's birthday. The veterans were severely beaten and later Cecil Schubert, who suffered a fractured skull, was personally recognized for his bravery by Mayor La Guardia.

The five players were Sergei Fedorov, Vladimir Konstantinov, Slava Kozlov, Slava Fetisov, and Igor Larionov. Three of the players were drafted by the Red Wings in 1989 and 1990, and their defections from the Soviet Union were aided by the Wings. The last two were acquired via trades. Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman played the five together as a unit at times from October 1995 to June 1997, but also mixed and matched them with other teammates. The Russian Five were major contributors in the Red Wings' Stanley Cup-winning run of the 1996‚Äì97 NHL season. Six days after the Cup victory, Vladimir Konstantinov was critically injured in a car accident that ended his hockey career. His Red Wings teammates dedicated the following season to him, and achieved the goal of \\"winning it for Vladdie\\" with their second consecutive Stanley Cup win. By 2003, the remaining four players had all either signed with new teams, been traded, or retired. The Russian Five left a lasting impact on the way ice hockey was played and taught in North America, and had contributed to a major change in how European players were viewed in the NHL. Background Soviet Union hockey jersey During the Cold War, the best hockey players in the Soviet Union were not allowed to leave to play in the National Hockey League, despite their talents being on par with North American and Western European players. Before 1989, Victor Nechayev, who played three games for the Los Angeles Kings, was the only player from the USSR to play in the NHL. Sergei Pryakhin was given permission to play in the NHL in 1989 and played in 46 games through 1991. Neither player was considered a star in their native Russia. In the fifth round of the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, the Buffalo Sabres selected Alexander Mogilny with the 89th overall pick. Mogilny had been called \\"the best 19-year-old player in the world\\" at the time. In May 1989, Mogilny became the first Russian player to defect from the Soviet Union in order to play in the NHL. Acquiring the Five =Fedorov and Konstantinov= In June 1989, Red Wings general manager Jim Devellano arrived at the NHL Entry Draft determined to \\"start drafting some Russians.\\" Devellano had discussed the possibility of drafting Sergei Fedorov with Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch; while Fedorov was considered one of the top young players in the world, the risk factor was high, as there was no guarantee that he would ever be able to come to Detroit to play, even if he wanted to. Ilitch instructed Devellano to draft the best players available, no matter where they came from, and management would worry about delivering them. Devellano consulted future Hall-of-Famer Steve Yzerman about Fedorov while the Red Wings captain was on an exercise bike in the Joe Louis Arena weight room. When he asked Yzerman for a scouting report, knowing that the two had played against each other in the World Championships, Yzerman simply replied, \\"He's better than me.\\" Devellano drafted Fedorov in the 4th round, higher than any Soviet player had ever been drafted before. Referring to NHL draft conventional wisdom that most elite players were gone after the first three rounds, he later said \\"I used the theory, who are we gonna get here now in the 4th round from North America, really?\\" The Red Wings followed up that pick with the 11th-round selection of Fedorov's Soviet teammate Vladimir Konstantinov, an imposing two-way defenseman who was already known as one of the best blue-liners in the world. Wings executive vice-president Jim Lites then contacted Detroit sportswriter Keith Gave about passing a secret message to Fedorov and Konstantinov from the Wings. Gave spoke Russian, and had a media credential that would enable him to get into an exhibition game in Helsinki where the Soviet national team was scheduled to play a Finnish elite-level club. Gave agreed to the mission, and in August 1989, managed to meet with the players after their game and slip them each a Red Wings media guide with a letter hidden inside. The letters made it clear that the Red Wings wanted both of them in Detroit and were willing to help them get there. By July 1990, Fedorov had decided to defect. The Soviet national team came to North America to play in the 1990 Goodwill Games, and had scheduled an exhibition match in Portland's Memorial Coliseum on July 22, 1990. Jim Lites came to Portland, picked up Fedorov outside his hotel after the game, and brought him to Detroit in Ilitch's private jet. Getting Konstantinov out of Russia would be more difficult, for two reasons. Unlike Fedorov, he had previously signed a 25-year contract committing himself to the army, and if he deserted, he would be considered a felon in Russia, which would make him ineligible for a work visa in the United States. He also had a wife and daughter, and would not consider leaving without them. Fedorov introduced Lites to his friend, a Russian journalist named Valery Matveev, who had moved to Detroit just after Fedorov's defection. Lites and Matveev worked together to secure an army discharge for Konstantinov. With cash provided by the Red Wings, Matveev bribed six Russian doctors to diagnose and confirm that Konstantinov was suffering from inoperable cancer, and thus secured his medical discharge from the military in the summer of 1991. The Red Wings were planning to fly Konstantinov and his family out from Russia and get him to Detroit in time for the start of training camp in September, but the 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt forced a change in plans. With the airports closed, Matveev took the family by train to Budapest. Lites met them there, again in Ilitch's private jet, and went back to Detroit with Konstantinov aboard. His wife and daughter followed two days later on a commercial flight. =Vyacheslav \\"Slava\\" Kozlov= Jim Devellano had been impressed by Slava Kozlov when he saw him play at a youth tournament in Lake Placid, New York, in 1987, when Kozlov was just 15. He called the Ilitches and told them, \\"I‚Äôve just seen the best 15-year-old hockey player I‚Äôve ever seen in my lifetime ‚Äì and I saw Wayne Gretzky play at that age.\\" Devellano used his third round pick (45th overall) to draft Kozlov in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, breaking his own record, set the previous year, for the highest draft pick of a Soviet player. He admitted later that this was a bigger risk, since in the third round, \\"You can get some North American players. It's not the fourth round, it's the third round.\\" In December 1990, a Red Wings contingent including Lites and assistant GM Nick Polano traveled to Regina, Saskatchewan, for the World Junior Championships, ready to bring Kozlov back to Detroit with them. However, Kozlov, just 19 at the time, was not ready to commit to defecting, and returned to the Soviet Union with the rest of his team. Polano met with Kozlov three more times over the next year. Then, in November 1991, Kozlov was seriously injured in a car accident that killed his passenger, teammate Kirill Tarasov. Polano traveled to Russia again and offered to take Kozlov to get medical care in Detroit. Valery Matveev bribed Russian doctors, much as he had in Konstantinov's case, but this time secured Kozlov's release from his Red Army enlistment with a diagnosis of permanent brain damage and loss of peripheral vision stemming from head injuries sustained in the crash. Kozlov traveled to Detroit in February 1992 and made his debut with the Wings on March 12. =Fetisov and Larionov= After Scotty Bowman was hired as the Red Wings coach in 1993, the Wings finished first in the Western Conference but lost in the first round of the 1994 playoffs. Bowman felt the team needed more help on defense, and he and assistant GM Ken Holland talked to Sergei Fedorov about Slava Fetisov, a CSKA Moscow veteran who was then playing with the New Jersey Devils. When Holland asked Fedorov his opinion on making a trade to acquire Fetisov, Fedorov replied, \\"Absolutely. It would be great for our team.\\" On April 3, 1995, the Wings traded a third-round pick to the Devils for Fetisov. He was 17 days short of turning 37. The Wings finished the lockout- shortened season with the best record in the NHL, but were swept in the Stanley Cup Finals by Fetisov's former team, the Devils. After that series, Fetisov began pushing Bowman to acquire Igor Larionov, another former Red Army teammate then playing for the San Jose Sharks. He told Bowman if he could make a trade happen, \\"We would have five (Russians) then, and if you ever want to, you could play them together.\\" Bowman convinced management to trade 50-goal scorer Ray Sheppard for the 34-year-old Larionov. Three days later, on October 27, 1995, Larionov joined his new team in Calgary to play against the Flames. A few minutes into the game, Bowman sent all five Russians over the boards together, and the Russian Five was born. The Five on the Red Wings For much of the 1995‚Äì96 season, Bowman played the five Russians together as a unit. By that time, there were 55 Russians playing in the NHL. Only the Red Wings, however, had put together such a combination in starring roles on their team. At the end of the regular season, the five Russians had scored 117 of the Red Wings' 325 goals. The team won an NHL-record 62 games, but fell to the Colorado Avalanche in six games in the Western Conference Finals. Towards the end of the regular season, Bowman had begun mixing and matching the five Russians with other teammates at times. In the 1997 playoffs, the Russian Five were a critical part of each series. In the first round against the St. Louis Blues, Larionov led the team with 5 assists. In a second-round sweep of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, the top three Wings scorers were Fedorov, with five points, along with Konstantinov and Kozlov, with four points each. In a Western Conference finals rematch against the Avalanche, Fedorov led all scorers with three goals and four assists, while Larionov and Kozlov each had two goals and three assists. All three players contributed a game-winning goal during the series. =1997 Stanley Cup Finals= In the Finals, Detroit faced the Philadelphia Flyers. Before the series, most hockey commentators believed that the Flyers' size and strength, led by MVP Eric Lindros, would be too much for the smaller Wings to handle, and the Flyers were favored to win the Stanley Cup. However, the Red Wings surprised most observers by being the more physical team, and one standout in that regard was Vladimir Konstantinov. Early in Game 1, he leveled Flyers winger Trent Klatt as he attempted to carry the puck into the Wings' end; Klatt lay on the ice for several seconds afterwards. In Game 3, Konstantinov delivered a hit on Dale Hawerchuk that led to a Red Wings goal 24 seconds later; Hawerchuk did not play in Game 4 and retired after the season. The Red Wings swept the Flyers and won their first Stanley Cup in 42 years. Speaking about Konstantinov's effect in that series, Jimmy Devellano said \\"Vladdie certainly let the Flyers know that the Red Wings weren‚Äôt going to be pushed around... he just hit everything in sight.\\" Bowman called him \\"a game-changer.\\" Assistant coach Dave Lewis said, \\"When Vladimir Konstantinov hit Hawerchuk, it changed the game. It changed the series. It was over at that point.\\" Teammate Kris Draper said it was \\"one of the hardest hits I‚Äôd ever seen.\\" At the conclusion of Game 4, the Stanley Cup was presented to the winning team's captain, Steve Yzerman, who hoisted it above his head and skated the traditional victory lap around Joe Louis Arena. He then handed the Cup to Slava Fetisov, the now-39-year-old former captain of the Red Army club. Fetisov immediately skated over to Igor Larionov and the two skated around the rink holding the cup aloft between them. =Limousine accident= Six days after the Stanley Cup win, most of the team gathered for a golf outing and dinner at The Orchards Golf Club in nearby Washington Township. Limousines were ordered so that no one partying would have to drive. Fetisov, Konstantinov, and team massage therapist Sergei Mnatsakanov left the party in a limousine driven by Richard Gnida, who had a suspended license after two convictions for drunk driving. The limo veered across three lanes of traffic, skipped the curb, and crashed into a tree. All four occupants were taken to nearby Beaumont Hospital; Fetisov suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung but made a full recovery. Mnatsakanov spent several weeks in a coma, and was permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Konstantinov suffered severe head injuries and was in a coma even longer than Mnatsakanov. When he finally awoke, he was unable to speak, and needed months of rehabilitation before he could leave the hospital. His brain had been torn in several places, which disrupted his ability to communicate, destroyed his short-term memory, and made him unable to move with balance. His hockey career was over. =1997-1998 season= Believe/–í–µ—Ä–∏–º patch worn by the Red Wings in the 1997‚Äì98 season The Red Wings players and coaches dedicated their efforts the following season to Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov. Kris Draper later said, \\"The motivation for us going into the Stanley Cup Finals in back-to-back years was definitely Vladdy. He was certainly in our hearts and in our minds and every time we played, he was that extra motivation that we need.\\" Assistant coach Dave Lewis later said, \\"I don't think anybody could have beaten us that year, because we were so focused on winning it for Vladdie and Sergei Mnatsakanov.\\" In November 1997, Konstantinov's physical therapist, John Wharton, decided that it was time to take him to Joe Louis Arena to see his teammates, and Konstantinov agreed with a thumbs-up. He was wheeled into the locker room a few minutes before practice ended, and the Red Wings arrived to see Konstantinov sitting in his stall with his jersey still hanging behind him. The players greeted him with hugs and handshakes, and the visits from Konstantinov became a regular occurrence for the rest of the season. The Red Wings managed the rare feat of repeating as Stanley Cup Champions, sweeping the Washington Capitals in the finals. Konstantinov was brought onto the ice in his wheelchair for the team's victory celebration, and Yzerman, rather than taking the traditional lap around the rink that the captain would normally skate, immediately brought the Cup to Konstantinov and put it in his lap. As he held the Cup steady, Fetisov and Larionov pushed Konstantinov's wheelchair as the entire team skated their victory lap to a standing ovation. =After the Russian Five= Slava Fetisov retired after the 1998 Stanley Cup win. Slava Kozlov was traded to the Buffalo Sabres in the summer of 2001. In 2000, Larionov, as a free agent, left to join the Florida Panthers, but was traded back to the Red Wings in December of that year. Fedorov and Larionov were with the Wings when they won their third Stanley Cup in 6 years in 2002. Three of the five ‚Äì Fetisov, Larionov, and Fedorov ‚Äì were elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame after they retired. Legacy The five players forever changed how North Americans viewed hockey players from Russia. Until the 1990s, there had been a perception that Europeans in general, and Russians in particular, were \\"soft\\", and that a team with too many of them would never be able to win a Stanley Cup. The Russian Five dispelled those myths forever, not only with two Cup wins but also because Konstantinov was one of the most feared hitters in the NHL. Steve Yzerman said of his former teammates, \\"The way they conducted themselves, the way they played for our team ‚Äì that has changed the tone for European players in general.\\" Beyond how Russians were perceived, the five also changed how hockey was taught in North America, in no small part because of the value they placed on puck possession. In the words of Jim Lites, \\"Everybody used to dump the puck in and chase it down behind the net. The Russians changed that. They changed our game.\\" Commenting on their puck control abilities, Red Wings goalie Mike Vernon once said, \\"There were times when I could have left the net and gone out for a pizza, and the other team still wouldn't have the puck from those guys when I got back.\\" Jim Devellano believed that the impact the Russian Five had went beyond hockey. \\"I grew up with all this propaganda about how the Russians were our enemy. Now here we were, bringing the enemy over here. Then they were so good ‚Äì the last missing piece for us to win. And they became our friends. I think I learned something about propaganda and how it gets our minds working against different people.\\" Sergei Fedorov agreed, saying, \\"We need to build more bridges than weapons. That‚Äôs my deep feeling about what should happen between our countries. Like we did in Detroit, you know?\\" References Nicknamed groups of ice hockey players ","title":"Russian Five"},{"id":"3822498","text":"Cedar Creek or Cedarcreek is an unincorporated community in Taney County, Missouri, United States.

On the map Lake Pontchartrain is to the north and the Mississippi River is to the south; the 15th Ward is the only one south of the Mississippi River where Algiers is located. The city of New Orleans, in the U.S. state of Louisiana, is divided into 17 wards. Politically, the wards are used in voting in elections, subdivided into precincts. Under various previous city charters of the 19th century, aldermen and later city council members were elected by ward. The city has not had officials elected to represent wards since 1912, but the ward designations remain a part of New Orleans' fabric. Socially, it is not uncommon for New Orleanians from some wards to identify where they are from by their ward number. History Map showing the first 11 Wards of New Orleans, c. 1870 or before Most of the boundaries of Wards 1 through 11 were drawn in 1852 when the city was reorganized from three separate municipalities into one centralized government. With various changes, these boundaries remain largely the same, and have not changed at all since the 1880s. The rest of the Wards were formed from the expansion of the city boundaries in the 1870s. The 12th, 13th, and 14th Wards were formed by annexation of land up river from the older city of New Orleans that had been Jefferson City and Greenville; the 15th by the annexation of the city of Algiers, Louisiana across the Mississippi River from the rest of the city, and finally the 16th and 17th Wards formed from the annexed city of Carrollton. Beginning in the 1980s, residents began to give new cultural meaning to wards as part of their local identity. Extremely prevalent in New Orleans hip hop (particularly Bounce Music), jazz, and other local genres of music, the concepts of \\"calling out\\" one's ward (stating the ward of one's residence), and \\"throwing up\\" one's ward (holding one's digits on one or both hands to signify their ward) have become mainstays of local culture and are even embraced casually at culturally mainstream events such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Although this practice is often seen as overly territorial and hostile, sometimes blamed for inciting violence, many simply see it as a friendly camaraderie shared with one's neighborhood.

It is usually a stark choice between suppressing homosexual desires and leading an undercover double life, or coming out and losing the respect and support of their families and communities. Background LGBT in Islam is influenced by the religious, legal, social, and cultural history of the nations with a sizable Muslim population, along with specific passages in the Quran and hadith, statements attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Quran cites the story of the \\"people of Lot\\" destroyed by the wrath of God because they engaged in lustful carnal acts between men. Homosexual acts are forbidden in traditional Islamic jurisprudence and are liable to different punishments, including the death penalty, depending on the situation and legal school. However, homosexual relationships were generally tolerated in pre-modern Islamic societies, and historical record suggests that these laws were invoked infrequently, mainly in cases of rape or other \\"exceptionally blatant infringement on public morals\\". Homoerotic themes were cultivated in poetry and other literary genres written in major languages of the Muslim world from the eighth century into the modern era. The conceptions of homosexuality found in classical Islamic texts resemble the traditions of Graeco-Roman antiquity, rather than modern Western notions of sexual orientation. It was expected that many or most mature men would be sexually attracted to both women and male adolescents (variously defined), and men were expected to wish to play only an active role in homosexual intercourse once they reached adulthood. In recent times, extreme prejudice persists, both socially and legally, in much of the Islamic world against people who engage in homosexual acts. Maldives Penal Code s 1205. Scholar The diverse ways of understanding of the Quran are echoed in the documentary by Dr Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle of Swarthmore College in the United States, currently a research fellow at Leiden University in the Netherlands. He believes that sharia ‚Äì Islamic law ‚Äì is determined by male jurists whose interpretations of Islamic texts are based on cultural assumptions situated in particular times, and particular political and geographical locations. Rather than sharia being divine, Kugle believes that it offers different avenues for Muslims to live their lives. He also points out that there is no word in the Quran for \\"gay\\" or \\"homosexual\\", and no mention of lesbians. Activists Some 200 lesbian and gay Muslims were contacted by the programme makers but only a handful were willing to be interviewed, and most of those insisted on keeping their identities hidden, to prevent reprisals. Only one was prepared to show his face and give his true name. He was Adnan Ali, an activist on issues affecting LGBT Muslims. Adnan described how, when he first came out in Pakistan, he was physically and verbally abused. He then came to the United Kingdom, where he chatted online with members of the American Al-Fatiha Foundation, an international organisation dedicated to Muslims who are LGBT or questioning, and their friends. Adnan then set up a sister group, now called Imaan. Voices The interviewees speak of their commitment to and belief in Islam, though they are mostly ostracised than their beliefs getting support by their community and family. ‚ÄòRazeem‚Äô speaks of his pain at being denied access to the children of his previous marriage, despite having a legal right to access and the fact that his wife ran away with another man. He also wishes there were more role models, like Adnan Ali, for gay Muslims. ‚ÄòShakir‚Äô and his parents find it easier to accept lesbianism than gay men's homosexuality. ‚ÄòFarah‚Äô contemplates going back into the closet, to lie about her sexuality to ease the tension in her relationship with her parents. The programme's presenter, Sonia Deol, says that the gay Muslim group Imaan supports the idea of \\"keeping sexuality a private matter\\".

The film is divided into nine episodes, following Encolpius and his friend Ascyltus as they try to win the heart of a young boy named Git√≥n within a surreal and dream-like Roman landscape. Plot The film opens on a graffiti- covered wall with Encolpius lamenting the loss of his lover Git√≥n to Ascyltus. Vowing to win him back, he learns at the Thermae that Ascyltus sold Git√≥n to the actor Vernacchio. At the theatre, he discovers Vernacchio and Git√≥n performing in a lewd play called the \\"emperor's miracle\\": a slave's hand is axed off and replaced with a gold one. Encolpius storms the stage and reclaims Git√≥n. On their return to Encolpius's home in the Insula Felicles, a Roman tenement building, they walk through the vast Roman brothel known as the Lupanare, observing numerous sensual scenes. They fall asleep after making love at Encolpius's place. Ascyltus sneaks into the room, waking Encolpius with a whiplash. Since both share the tenement room, Encolpius proposes they divide up their property and separate. Ascyltus mockingly suggests they split Git√≥n in half. Encolpius is driven to suicidal despair, however, when Git√≥n decides to leave with Ascyltus. At that moment, an earthquake destroys the tenement. Encolpius meets the poet Eumolpus at the art museum. The elderly poet blames current corruption on the mania for money and invites his young friend to a banquet held at the villa of Trimalchio, a wealthy freeman, and his wife Fortunata. Eumolpus's declamation of poetry is met with catcalls and thrown food. While Fortunata performs a frantic dance, the bored Trimalchio turns his attention to two very young boys. Scandalized, Fortunata berates her husband who attacks her then has her covered in gizzards and gravy. Fancying himself a poet, Trimalchio recites one of his finer poems whereupon Eumolpus accuses him of stealing verses from Lucretius. Enraged, Trimalchio orders the poet to be tortured by his slaves in the villa's huge kitchen furnace. The guests are then invited to visit Trimalchio's tomb where he enacts his own death in an ostentatious ceremony. The story of the Matron of Ephesus is recounted, the first story within a story in the film.Bondanella, 260 Encolpius finally leaves the villa, helping the limping, beaten Eumolpus to drink water from a pool in a tilled field. In return for his kindness, Eumolpus bequeaths the spirit of poetry to his young friend. The next morning Encolpius, Git√≥n, and Ascyltus are imprisoned on the pirate ship of Lichas, a middle-aged merchant; they are part of a consignment of attractive young men being delivered for the titillation of the reclusive Roman emperor. Lichas selects Encolpius for a Greco-Roman wrestling match and quickly subdues him. Smitten by his beauty, Lichas takes Encolpius as his spouse in a wedding ceremony blessed by his wife, Tryphaena. After a long voyage the ship arrives at the emperor's private island, only to find it overrun by soldiers in the service of a usurper. The teenage emperor kills himself, and the soldiers board the ship and behead Lichas under Tryphaena's satisfied gaze. While \\"new Caesar\\" holds a fearsome victory parade back in Rome, Encolpius and Ascyltus escape the soldiers and make their way inland. They discover an abandoned villa, whose owners have freed their slaves and committed suicide to escape the new emperor. Encolpius and Ascyltus spend the night on the property and make love with an African slave girl who has stayed behind. Fleeing the villa when soldiers on horseback arrive in the courtyard to burn the owners' corpses, the two friends reach a desert. Ascyltus placates a nymphomaniac's demands in a covered wagon while Encolpius waits outside, listening to the woman's servant discuss a hermaphrodite demi-god reputed to possess healing powers at the Temple of Ceres. With the aid of a mercenary, they kill two men and kidnap the hermaphrodite in the hope of obtaining a ransom. Once exposed to the desert sun, however, the hermaphrodite sickens and dies of thirst. Enraged, the mercenary tries to murder his two companions but is overpowered and killed. Captured by soldiers, Encolpius is released in a labyrinth and forced to play Theseus to a gladiator's Minotaur for the amusement of spectators at the festival of Momus, the God of Laughter. When the gladiator spares Encolpius's life because of his well-spoken words of mercy, the festival rewards the young man with Ariadne, a sensual woman with whom he must copulate as the crowd looks on. Impotent, Encolpius is publicly humiliated by Ariadne. Eumolpus offers to take him to the Garden of Delights where prostitutes are said to effect a cure for his impotence but the treatment‚Äîgentle whipping of the buttocks‚Äîfails miserably. In the second of the stories within a story in the film, the owner of the Garden of Delights narrates the tale of Oenothea to Encolpius. For having rejected his advances, a sorcerer curses a beautiful young woman: she must spend her days kindling fires for the village's hearths from her genitalia. Inspired, Encolpius and Ascyltus hire a boatman to take them to Oenothea's home. Greeted by an old woman who has him drink a potion, Encolpius falls under a spell where his sexual prowess is restored to him by Oenothea in the form of an Earth Mother figure and sorceress. When Ascyltus is murdered in a field by the boatman, Encolpius decides to join Eumolpus's ship bound for North Africa. But Eumolpus has died in the meantime, leaving as his heirs all those willing to eat his corpse. Encolpius hasn't the stomach for this last and bitter mockery but is nonetheless invited by the captain to board the ship. In a voice-over, Encolpius explains that he set sail with the captain and his crew. His words end in mid-sentence, as does Petronius's book, when a distant island appears on the horizon and the film cuts abruptly to frescoes of the film's characters on a crumbling wall. Cast Production Fellini's project saw competition from another film titled Satyricon, released the same year. Producer Alfredo Bini had registered the Satyricon title in 1962. When Fellini and his producer Alberto Grimaldi started work on their film, Bini contracted Gian Luigi Polidoro to direct his own version. Grimaldi sued Bini to halt the competing film, but lost; as a result, Fellini's picture was titled Fellini Satyricon to distinguish it.Kezich, 292 Co-screenwriter Bernardino Zapponi noted that Fellini used a deliberately jerky form of dubbing that caused the dialogue to appear out of sync with the actors' lips. This was in keeping with his original intention of creating a profound sense of estrangement throughout the film.Bondanella, 244 Adaptation Petronius's original text survives only in fragments. While recuperating from a debilitating illness in 1967, Fellini reread Petronius and was fascinated by the missing parts, the large gaps between one episode and the next.Bondanella, 239 The text's fragmentary nature encouraged him to go beyond the traditional approach of recreating the past in film: the key to a visionary cinematic adaptation lay in narrative techniques of the dream state that exploited the dream's imminent qualities of mystery, enigma, immorality, outlandishness, and contradiction. In Comments on Film, Fellini explained that his goal in adapting Petronius's classic was \\"to eliminate the borderline between dream and imagination: to invent everything and then to objectify the fantasy; to get some distance from it in order to explore it as something all of a piece and unknowable.\\"Fellini, Comments on Film, 173 Critic Christopher Sharrett observes that Fellini's \\"adaptation also reveals the paucity of the source, the kitschiness of the 'big ideas' from literary history. Genre film is a comfortable vehicle for the critical agenda undertaken, as Fellini piles up genre tropes as a way of showing the inherent generic contrivance, the 'trashiness,' that is basic to all such representation.\\"Sharrett, \\"Intertext and the End of Humanism\\" in Federico Fellini: Contemporary Perspectives (ed. Burke and Waller), Toronto: Toronto University Press (2002), 125. The most important of the narrative changesAccording to Bondanella, 246 that Fellini makes to Petronius's text is the addition of a battle between Encolpius and the Minotaur in the Labyrinth thereby linking Encolpius to Theseus and the journey into the unconscious. Other original sequences include a nymphomaniac in a desert caravan whose despondent husband pays Ascyltus and Encolpius to couple with her, and an hermaphrodite worshipped as a demigod at the Temple of Ceres. Abducted by the two protagonists and a mercenary, the hermaphrodite later dies a miserable death in a desert landscape that, in Fellini's adaptation, is posed as an ill- omened event, none of which is to be found in the Petronian version. Though the two protagonists, Encolpius and Ascyltus, appear throughout, the characters and locations surrounding them change unexpectedly. This intentional technique of fragmentation conveys Fellini's view of both the original text and the nature of history itself, and is echoed visually in the film's final shot of a ruined villa whose walls, painted with frescoes of the scenes we have just seen, are crumbling, fading and incomplete.Bondanella, 240. Fellini's interest in Carl Jung's theory of the collective unconscious is also on display with an abundance of archetypes in highly dreamlike settings.Bondanella, 240 Release =Home video= Fellini Satyricon was released on VHS by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on September 7, 1999. The film was then released on DVD by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Home Entertainment on April 10, 2001, for Region 1 and on May 15, 2005, for the German market. On February 24, 2015, The Criterion Collection released the film, newly restored through a 4K digital transfer, on Blu-ray and DVD for Region A and Region 1 respectively. The restoration was supervised by the film's cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno. Both of the editions include the film's original trailer, an audio commentary of Eileen Lanouette Hughes's memoir On the Set of \\"Fellini Satyricon\\": A Behind-the-Scenes Diary, Gideon Bachmann's hour-long documentary Ciao, Federico!, archival interviews with the film's director Federico Fellini, a new interview with Rotunno done in 2011, a new exclusively made documentary titled Fellini and Petronius featuring discussions between classicists Luca Canali and Joanna Paul about the film's adaptation of Satyricon, a new interview with Mary Ellen Mark, a photographer for Look magazine, about her experiences on the film's set taking photographs of the shoot, a gallery of ephemera related to the film, a newly made English subtitle translation, and a leaflet containing a new essay by author and film scholar Michael Wood. Exclusive to the Blu-ray edition is the addition of an uncompressed monaural soundtrack. The new Blu-ray and DVD cover and interior poster was illustrated by Edward Kinsella and designed by Eric Skillman. On April 27, 2015, Eureka Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom as part of the Masters of Cinema series, using as a foundation the 4K digital transfer done for the Criterion release. This release includes a 36-page booklet and the film's original trailer. Reception =Italy= First screened at the 30th Venice Film Festival on 4 September 1969, Fellini Satyricon received generally positive reviews by critics writing in \\"stunned bewilderment\\".Kezich, 286 Time reported that the \\"normally reserved press corps gave the film a five-minute ovation ... the Venice showing was so wildly popular that festival tickets, normally 2,000 lire ($3.20), were being sold on the black market at 60,000 lire (about $100) apiece\\".Time, 10 September 1969 Fellini biographer Tullio Kezich noted that there were \\"no outright negative reactions. The rampant moralizing of ten years ago seems to have passed out of fashion\\".Kezich, 287 In his favorable Corriere della Sera review, Giovanni Grazzini argued that \\"Fellini's Rome bears absolutely no relationship to the Rome we learned about in school books. It is a place outside historical time, an area of the unconscious in which the episodes related by Petronius are relived among the ghosts of Fellini ... His Satyricon is a journey through a fairytale for adults. It is evident that Fellini, finding in these ancient personages the projection of his own human and artistic doubts, is led to wonder if the universal and eternal condition of man is actually summed up in the frenzied realization of the transience of life which passes like a shadow. These ancient Romans who spend their days in revelry, ravaged by debauchery, are really an unhappy race searching desperately to exorcise their fear of death\\".Grazzini's review first published in Corriere della Sera, 5 September 1969. Fava and Vigano, 135 Kezich saw the film as a study in self-analysis: \\"Everything seems to be aimed at making the viewer feel ill at ease, at giving him the impression that he is watching for the first time scenes from a life he never dreamed could have existed. Fellini has described his film as 'science fiction of the past,' as though the Romans of that decadent age were being observed by the astounded inhabitants of a flying saucer. Curiously enough, in this effort of objectivity, the director has created a film that is so subjective as to warrant psychoanalysis. It is pointless to debate whether the film proposes a plausible interpretation of ancient Rome, or whether in some way it illustrates Petronius: the least surprising parts are those that come closest to Petronius's text or that have some vague historical significance.\\"Kezich's review first published in Panorama, 18 September 1969. Fava and Vigano, 136. The film performed well at the box office in Italy, France, and Japan.Alpert, 219 The film was selected as the Italian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 42nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The following year, Fellini was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. =United States= As co-producers keen to recoup their investment, executives at United Artists made certain that Fellini received \\"a maximum of exposure\\" during his American promotional tour of the film by organizing press and television interviews in New York and Los Angeles.Alpert, 220 For Vincent Canby of The New York Times, Satyricon was \\"the quintessential Fellini film, a travelogue through an unknown galaxy, a magnificently realized movie of his and our wildest dreams\\". Roger Ebert, while recanting his original statement that the film was a masterpiece, nonetheless gave it a high retrospective rating and wrote, \\"It is so much more ambitious and audacious than most of what we see today that simply as a reckless gesture, it shames these timid times.\\" For Archer Winston of the New York Post, the film's classical background in Petronius was fused into \\"a powerful contemporary parallel. It is so beautifully composed and imagined that you would do yourself a disservice if, for any reason, you allowed yourself to miss it\\".Fava and Vigano, 138 Fellini biographer Parker Tyler declared it \\"the most profoundly homosexual movie in all history\\".Alpert, 221 The film currently holds a 77% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 7.02/10.

It was about modern men encountering dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals on an island. The picture was scrapped by RKO studio head David O. Selznick on the grounds of expense, and Merian C. Cooper, the studio producer who recommended the film's cancellation, considered the storyline to be boring, due to lack of action. The completed footage ran 20 minutes in length, although approximately eleven minutes of footage is all that survives today. Cooper later used some of the miniatures and dinosaur armatures and O'Brien's stop-motion animation techniques for King Kong. Plot At 40 degrees south of the equator, off the coast of southern Chile, not far from Patagonia, the luxury yacht Titan rests at anchor. On board ship is wealthy American tycoon Thorton Armitage along with his young son Billy, his socialite daughter Elaine, her large soft aunt Louise, and Billy's personal tutor Steve, who teaches him about evolution. Meanwhile, below deck Elaine enters and flirts with Steve; thrilled at the thought that Elaine loves him, Steve grabs her in his arms. Elaine's fianc√©e, Ned Hallet, watches from a distance as the two kiss. When Steve looks to confess his love for Elaine, he is stunned as she explains that the kiss meant nothing. Embarrassed and enraged, Steve threatens to quit the crew, while above deck the passengers can see ominous storm clouds are brewing. With freak suddenness, a tempest is upon them. Through heavy seas they see a submarine dispatched from the Chilean navy, in an effort to save the Armitage party. The Chilean captain enters and encourages the crew of the Titan to board the submarine. All of a sudden a massive waterspout forms, tears the Titan from its anchorage, and hurls it away. From the churning waters, a massive earthquake thrusts up a huge rocky promontory. The beautiful yacht is dashed upon the new island and is destroyed just as the submarine dives beneath the surging waves. The submarine is pulled downward by the rise of the rocky headland and spirals out of control. Buffeted by the surging currents and thrown off course, the stunned crew and passengers find themselves inside a deep underwater ravine. The submarine's crew look through the port to see green water filled with strange creatures. Their amazement is cut short as the sub runs aground on a volcanic shelf. The submarine then surfaces to find itself in a tropical lake surrounded by steep cliffs. They have traveled through deep underwater caverns and have surfaced in the cauldron of an extinct volcano. The crew soon discover that dinosaurs exist on the island and promptly escape from a stampede of Brontosaurus. Later on shore, the Chilean crew are attacked by a prehistoric rhinoceros-like mammal known as an Arsinotherium while trying to cross a log bridge. The Arsinotherium gores many of the sailors to death, before knocking the fleeing sailors from the log bridge into the raging river below; weak with horror, Steve stumbles through the jungle back to the others and just avoids been killed by a bull Woolly Mammoth. The survivors, assuming that they will never see civilization again, build a shelter to live in on a high cliff over looking the lush valley. After Ned Hallet shoots a Brontosaurus, the sauropod retaliates by destroying one of the shelters with its long neck, and it is Elaine that saves everyone by striking a burning torch into the beast's mouth. Everyone is furious with Hallet for putting them in danger; Hallet leaves the camp in anger after being scolded and takes his frustration out on a baby Triceratops. The mother rushes to the aid of the dying infant and gores Hallet to death. Steve then takes command over the group and decides to repair the radio from the sub, but needs a replacement leyden jar for it to work. While the survivors are exploring ancient ruins, looking for a replacement leyden jar, a block gives way, causing Elaine to fall. Elaine is attacked by a Pteranodon which is driven off by Steve. Shortly afterwards, the crew are chased into a temple by an aggressive Stegosaurus. The crew is then trapped between the Stegosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus which lives in the temple. Rather than killing the crew, the two dinosaurs fight one another. In the end, the Tyrannosaurus kills the Stegosaurus and feeds it to its infant as the crew escapes. After searching the temple, the crew discover a type of metal jar which they could use to get their radio working. The crew try to send out an S.O.S., but the volcano begins to erupt, causing mass hysteria among the dinosaurs. A Pteranodon crashes into the tower used to conduct the signal, leaving the crew stranded to be killed by the erupting volcano. Facing death, Elaine and Steve finally confess their love for one another. As Billy faints from heat exhaustion, rescue planes arrive and land on the boiling lake and save the crew from certain doom. Aboard the rescue ship, Thorton Armitage boasts of his group's adventures. Everyone is sceptical about his claims, when suddenly a Pteranodon, exhausted from its long flight, falls aboard the ship's deck, proving his story to be true. The film ends with Steve and Elaine sharing a laugh as they look forward to their new life together. Legacy Despite his dislike for the film's story, the special effects in the completed footage impressed Cooper and inspired him to hire O'Brien to create the effects in Cooper's film King Kong (1933). Some of the dinosaur scenes planned for Creation were even rewritten and inserted into the King Kong script and most of the dinosaur models O'Brien used in Kong had originally been made for Creation. The shipwreck sequence in Kongs companion production, The Most Dangerous Game, was reportedly salvaged from this film.Pettigrew, Neil, The Stop-Motion Filmography, McFarland and Co., Inc., 1999, p. 161 and again p. 470 In the two-disc 2005 DVD release of King Kong, the surviving footage from Creation is shown, as well as a dramatization of how the entire film might have been like if completed, using a combination of the existing footage, along with production sketches, test stills and a voiceover narrator. In the remaining footage, two infant Triceratops play tug of war with a vine before their mother separates the two. The loser of the conflict wanders off into the jungle where it views a chimpanzee, a jaguar, and eventually an armed sailor identified by the script as Ned Hallet. Hallet stumbles upon the infant Triceratops and shoots it through the eye. The dying infant screams out to its mother who charges to the rescue, chasing Hallet through the jungle. The final scene in which Ned Hallet is gored to death by the vengeful mother is lost. Merian C. Cooper intended to use the footage in King Kong, but felt that it did not fit in with the rest. An altered scene involving three adult Triceratops, two of which are killed by Kong, while the third one shows up at one side of the log bridge over the chasm into which Kong (on the other side) kills some of the men on the bridge by rolling it back and forth, causing them to fall to their deaths below, does appear in the 1932 Kong screenplay and the film's novelization. Parts of the remaining footage can also be seen in the computer game Dinosaur Museum by Perspective Visuals and the educational video More Dinosaurs. Some of the other creatures planned for the film were an Agathaumas, a Styracosaurus and an Ankylosaurus, according to concept art. Influence on Kong * The scene in King Kong in which Kong shakes sailors off of a log bridge was inspired by the scene in Creation in which the Arsinoitherium knocks sailors from a log. * Ann Darrow's abduction by the Pteranodon was heavily inspired by a scene in Creation in which a Pteranodon attempted to abduct Elaine, Steve's love interest. * Kong's battle with the Tyrannosaurus was taken from a scene in Creation where the Tyrannosaurus battles a Stegosaurus in an ancient golden temple. * All of the dinosaur models featured in King Kong were originally designed for Creation.

The promotion In order to promote the new A3 model in 2005, Audi, instead of featuring the car at a show as scheduled, in the car's place they put an announcement that it had been stolen and a request that the public report clues to their website. The car had not been stolen, but they wanted the public to participate in an elaborate nationwide game where clues were planted in public places to hint at where the \\"thieves\\" had taken the car. On their website, they posted evidence and the public was encouraged to view the website as actors followed the car over a period of time. The entire program was praised as an innovative advertising campaign. As a game, it falls under the classification of Alternate Reality Game, or ARG. The game involved, loosely, three layers of interaction: character development and back story, file and password cracking, and live events (or, generally, the Retrievals). Players who were involved in the live events received special pins and complimentary cell phones (which, as a side note, were difficult for some winners to activate). The story The story revolved around Nisha Roberts and Ian Yarbrough, and their art retrieval business, Last Resort Retrieval. The majority of the plot involved the attempts of Nisha, Ian, the players, and Nisha's video game designer friend, Virgil in trying to stop the world's greatest art heist. Ian and Nisha, specifically, were hot on the tracks of a very coordinated theft team, which was led by a person who was initially identified only as Arclight. Arclight was organizing theft timetables, commissioning forged replicas, doing reconnaissance work, and hiring all manner of unruly assistants for the big heist. Virgil seemed to be the main suspect throughout much of the game, due to his odd behaviour and lousy attitude. Early in the game, a security camera recording was discovered which showed a shadowy villain stashing pieces of information inside 6 different Audi A3 cars. The cars, throughout the course of the game, were all tracked down, and infiltrated by the Retrievers, to get back the information hidden in them. By piecing together the whole of all data found in all cars, the full scope of the Big Art Heist was revealed. Major characters =Nisha= Nisha Roberts is an art recovery expert working under the company name of Last Resort Retrieval, together with her boyfriend Ian. =Ian= Ian is a computer hacker, and boyfriend of the often tempestuous Nisha. Their relationship is explored to the degree of him being jealous of her being the one in the spotlight. At one point in the game, he decides to boldly take on a job which Nisha would otherwise tackle, and is roundly criticised for his poor planning. =Virgil= Virgil is a legendary game designer. He and Nisha are old friends. He was married, but his wife died some years ago, sending Virgil's life into turmoil. He has become a recluse, and had only recently (as of the time of this ARG) come out into the public eye once again, building a game based directly on Nisha Roberts, called The Nisha Chronicles: Volume 1. During the game, Virgil was often foreshadowed as being the villain, but in reality he was simply paranoid due to his line of work, and traumatized by the loss of his wife. =Arclight= Arclight was the criminal mastermind behind the art theft. =The Retrievers= Essential to the play of the game were a number of real-life players, who would be broadly dubbed \\"retrievers.\\" Retrievers would be called in, on various occasions, to different places around the United States, where they would attempt to retrieve an SD Card from inside an Audi A3.

The Margalla range has an area of 12,605 hectares. The hills are a part of Murree hills. It is a range with many valleys as well as high mountains. On 6 January 2012, after almost six years, Pir Sohawa, the city's highest tourist spot, received a few inches of snowfall. Another measurable snow event occurred on 11 February 2016 where 2 inches fell after four years. Infrastructure View of The Margalla hills Khayaban-e-Iqbal, arises on the north east side from the 4th Avenue (Nur Pur Shahan), runs between E and F sectors and ends at Service road West of F 11 and E 11 (Golra) sectors in the south east. It will be extended up to Grand Trunk (GT) road in the near future and then it will be able to connect Nur Pur Shahan with the GT road.  Paleontology and archeology  According to the research carried out by scientists and archaeologists of the project \\"Post- Earthquake Explorations of Human Remains in Margalla Hills\\", the formation of the Margalla Hills dates to the Miocene epoch. The dominant limestone of the Margalla is mixed with sandstone and occasional minor beds of shale. The archaeologists of the project have also found two human footprints over one million years old here, preserved in sandstone.  Flora and fauna  Blue region on the Islamabad map denotes the Margalla Hills region. Original Grand Trunk Road passing through Margalla Hills to Kala Chitta Range There are around 250 to 300 species of plants on the Margalla hills. As many as two- thirds of them are used by the people for their medicinal effects to treat or cure various diseases. The Margalla Hills are home to various species of wildlife, including monkeys, exotic birds and carnivores such as the rare and presently endangered Margalla leopard. Much less common are leopards, which occasionally come down from the Murree area but usually remain high up in the hills. Villagers dwelling in the Margallas do report sighting of leopards off and on. High diversity of birds in the Margallas is due to the combination many ecological components that together make it a unique location. No other Pakistani location could come even near in the number of species seen.

In 2007, Boca Developers built a twin-tower residential community on the site with 373 units. In 2009, iStar Residential, a division of iStar Financial, purchased 160 of the unsold residences and leased a majority of them while the real estate market was in recovery. In late 2013, the project was renamed One Fifty One at Biscayne. The rental units are being sold as condominiums. The site is bordered to the east by Biscayne Bay and Oleta River State Park, Florida's largest remaining coastal mangrove preserve and urban park, to the west by commercial developments. It is notable as one of the largest residential projects ever planned on a former Superfund site and a demonstration of the excesses of the housing bust. The site also reflects one of the largest write-offs in securitized mortgage history with a $196 million writeoff of an initial $200 million investment. History Biscayne Landing is the result of a partnership between the City of North Miami and Boca Developers. The city has leased the former superfund landfill to Boca Developers for two hundred years. As part of the partnership agreement with the city, Boca Developers will match the construction of new residences at Biscayne Landing with an equal number of new or rehabilitated affordable housing units on brownfield sites within the city. In addition, Boca Developers has also committed up to $25 million toward the renovation and expansion of North Miami's library, the construction of an Olympic training facility, and construction of the David Lawrence, Jr. K-8 School. The Miami- Dade commission has agreed to contribute $31 million of the costs of the Munisport cleanup, using part of a $130 million bond issue earmarked to clean up other polluted sites in the county. Wells Fargo Bank filed a foreclosure suit against the developer in August 2009. iStar Financial purchased 160 unsold units while the property was in foreclosure and put them on the market as condominiums in late 2013. The majority of the 160 condominiums were sold to foreign investors. Environmental Condition Biscayne Landing's environmental standing is described as \\"brownfield,\\" which the government defines as property for which the expansion, redevelopment or reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of contaminants. It is located on the former Munisport landfill. Multiple government agencies have tested the groundwater under the landfill and all detected a soup of about 30 chemicals, from lead to PCBs, but these chemicals are generally at levels that the EPA has deemed low enough to allow \\"unlimited use and unrestricted exposure.\\" The City of North Miami claims that the only remaining environmental concerns at the site are Ammonia contamination in the groundwater, and methane from the biodegradation of the buried solid waste. There are treatment wells on-site to remove the ammonia, with an estimated completion time of 20 years. Future In 2013, with the real estate market in full recovery, iStar brought on The DevStar Group, a Miami-based development, sales and investment firm to market and sell the 160 units. Dev Star Group principals successfully turned around two other local condominium projects ‚Äî Paramount Bay in Miami and Ocean House on South Beach. The homeowners association renamed the twin towers as One Fifty One at Biscayne, and the developer began selling units as condominiums in late 2013. Several million dollars worth of amenities and improvements are currently underway at the development. Separately, the property, which is currently owned by the City of North Miami, was leased in 2012 for 200 years to the Oleta Partners group, which is owned by real estate developers Michael Swerdlow and the Lefrak Organization. Plans for the site include covering up all remaining lakes, building an 850,000 square foot shopping center focused on big-box stores, a new residential condominium community, offices and a hotel. Oleta Partners has taken a number of steps to remediate the groundwater under the property, including designing, permitting and building a Class 1 wastewater injection well. A pump station has been designed and is under review. A remedial action plan has been approved by the Regulatory Economic Resources department of Miami-Dade County. Separately, the city of North Miami says ‚Äúthat in the 3 or so years that the Oaks buildings have been occupied, no methane gas alarm has alerted.‚Äù References External links *EPA's Brownfields portal *Developer's Project Web Site *(Page 15) \\"Development Strives to Bury Dirty Past\\", Jim W.

He first appeared in Adventure Comics #287 (June 1961), created by Jerry Siegel and George Papp. Various versions of the Dev-Em character has appeared over the years in Legion of Super-Heroes related comic books. The original Dev-Em was a Kryptonian juvenile delinquent that attacked Superboy; after being thwarted by Superboy, Dev-Em traveled to the 30th century where he became an occasional ally of the Legion. Once DC Comics re-wrote their history with Crisis on Infinite Earths Dev-Em was changed into a Daxamite instead of a Kryptonian. Post-Infinite Crisis, he was once again made a Kryptonian; a criminal sentenced to the Phantom Zone. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= In the pre- Crisis on Infinite Earths continuity, Dev-Em is a Kryptonian juvenile delinquent who took Jor-El's warnings of Krypton's impending doom seriously enough to place himself in suspended animation in an orbiting space capsule. When the planet Krypton exploded, Dev-Em's ship was blasted into space, where it eventually landed on Earth. Dev-Em imprisons Superboy in the Phantom Zone and assumes his identity in an effort to destroy the Boy of Steel's reputation. Eventually he frees Superboy and departs from the twentieth century, traveling through time to finally settle on the more advanced Earth of the 30th century. Since the people of Smallville will not believe Superboy's story of the impostor, he has to use a cover story that he was acting under the influence of Red Kryptonite to restore his reputation. Dev-Em returns in Adventure Comics #320 (May 1964), where it is revealed that the so- called \\"Knave of Krypton\\" has reformed and joined the Interstellar Counter- Intelligence Corps of the 30th century. He is reluctantly offered membership in the Legion of Super-Heroes but turns it down. Despite his occasionally abrasive nature, Dev-Em aids the Legion on several occasions, most notably in the \\"Great Darkness Saga\\" against Darkseid. Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2, #290‚Äì294 =Post-Crisis, Pre-Zero Hour= In the limited series Who's Who in the Legion of Super-Heroes #1 (April 1988), his post-Crisis background was changed. Since Superman is now the only survivor of Krypton because of the Superman reboot, his entry in this encyclopedia-like series states that he is \\"David Emery\\", a resident of Titan, home world of Saturn Girl, who uses his mental powers to give himself Kryptonian-style super powers. This origin is never used in any actual comic story. Dev-Em appears in the \\"Time and Time Again\\" storyline in which the Man of Steel bounces between the 30th century (home of the Legion) and the 20th century. Superman encounters Dev-Em, now portrayed as an insane Daxamite, as a full grown adult whose powers rivaled Superman's. He tried to destroy the Earth's moon but was challenged by the Legion. Dev-Em makes short work of Superman, Laurel Gand and the rest of the Legion. Dev-Em is seemingly stopped by Shrinking Violet as she shrinks to a small size and enters Dev-Em's ear, scratching his insides. However, he soon initiates the Dominators' covert Triple Strike program, destroying the moon and causing massive damage to cities across the Earth.Adventures of Superman (vol. 1) #478 (May 1991)Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #19 (June 1991) =Post-Infinite Crisis= In the aftermath of the Infinite Crisis in which Kon-El died, a man going by the name Devem is seen as part of a cult of Kryptonian worshippers called the \\"Cult of Conner\\" in 52 #4 (May 31, 2006). He is revealed to actually be a \\"psych-ward refugee named Derek Mathers who has a history of fraud.\\" 52 #4 In Action Comics Geoff Johns, Richard Donner and Adam Kubert present a new version of Dev-Em. This Dev-Em is a renegade Kryptonian being held as a prisoner for murder and perversion. As with most Kryptonian prisoners, he is sentenced to the Phantom Zone. He attacks Superman there but is eventually taken down by Mon-El.Action Comics (vol. 1) #851 (August 2007) Powers and abilities In both his Daxamite and Kryptonian iterations, Dev- Em is possessed of the same superhuman abilities of both races while beneath the empowering light of a yellow sun such as that of Earth's solar system. His basic abilities are superhuman strength, superhuman speed and superhuman stamina sufficient to bend steel in his bare hands, overpower a locomotive, leap over a tall building in a single bound and outrun a speeding bullet; heightened senses of hearing and sight including X-ray vision as well as telescopic and microscopic vision; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing; longevity; powerful freezing breath; heat vision; and flight. In his Post-Infinite Crisis Kryptonian iteration, Dev-Em is never allowed to experience the full measure of his abilities as he is never permitted full exposure and absorption of the yellow solar radiation of Earth's sun before he is eventually defeated and banished back to the Phantom Zone. Like other Phantom Zone escapees, Dev-Em's abilities are insufficient compared to those of Superman due to his relatively short time in the Sun compared to Superman. His only advantage being his superior hand-to-hand combat prowess as a member of Krypton's military as well as his ruthless mindset and courage in battle. In his Daxamite iteration, he shares the race's genetic vulnerability to terminal lead poisoning. In his Kryptonian iterations, he is vulnerable to kryptonite. In both iterations, he is vulnerable to the radiation of a red sun which cancels out the yellow solar radiation flourishing in his cells and subsequently neutralizes his abilities. His virtual invulnerability offers no protection against mind control or magic nor can it withstand the force of several atomic bombs without causing him sufficient injury; he is also vulnerable to opponents of superior strength such as Doomsday nor can he outrun Speedsters such as the Flash. Other versions In the prequel comic to Man of Steel (which is set thousands of years in the past), Dev-Em I is portrayed as a Kryptonian in training who begins killing his competitors but is caught and put on trial for doing so. Despite this, he was able to escape prosecution on Krypton and managed to make his way on a scout ship during a Kryptonian expedition to Earth. Dev-Em killed the entire crew on the ship, with the exception of Kara Zor-El. He is killed in a struggle with Kara, as the ship crashes on Earth. Kara is seen leaving the wreckage, which would later be known as the \\"Fortress of Solitude\\".Man of Steel Prequel In other media =Television= x150px Dev-Em appears in the TV series Krypton, portrayed by Aaron Pierre.

The Devils River in southwestern Texas, part of the Rio Grande drainage basin, has limited areas of whitewater along its length. It begins in northwest Sutton County, at , where six watercourses come together, Dry Devils River, Granger Draw, House Draw, Jackson, Flat Rock Draw, and Rough Canyon. It flows southwest for through Val Verde County and empties into the northeastern shore of the Amistad Reservoir, an impoundment of the Rio Grande near Del Rio, Texas on the Texas/Mexico border, . The discharge of the Devils River, as measured at IBWC gaging station 08-4494.00 near the river's mouth, averages , with a maximum of and a minimum of . Its drainage basin above that point is . The Devils River is considered the most unspoiled river in Texas. Its remote location in a hostile environment limits pollution from human and domestic animal populations. In addition, the river flows underground for part of its journey. As it passes underground, the gravel, sand and limestone scrub the river water clean before it re-emerges some downstream. The Devils River Conservancy is a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to the protection and preservation of the Devils River for future generations of Texans and works throughout the basin to promote conservation ethics among landowners and paddlers. Recreation Although the river is popular for kayaking and canoeing, it is difficult to gain access because much of the river is bounded by private property. However, much of the river is protected through conservation easements on both sides. The Nature Conservancy holds conservation easements on several ranch properties protecting the river. Along with the Devils River State Natural Area the protected land along the river totals . =Traversing the river= The river itself is long, but much of the upper half of the river is not suitable for canoeing or kayaking because of a lack of water and limited access. The best part of the river for recreation is about long and runs from Bakers Crossing to the last drop off point at Lake Amistad. The most common point of entry into the river is Bakers Crossing on Texas State Highway 163. Camping sites are available and you can also leave your vehicle at Bakers Crossing. Most of the river is fairly calm with mostly class two rapids and small class three rapids (see International Scale of River Difficulty). However the river can rise and fall greatly with rainfall, even if the rain is not in the direct area of the river. Dolan Falls is a waterfall about tall and is located at about and must be avoided. Past Dolan Falls at about is Three Tier Rapids, a class four rapid most of the year, but when the river swells, can be a short class 5 and should be attempted by only the more experienced paddlers. The river is characterized by long, deep pools with reed covered rapids near the end of these pools. A map is strongly suggested as both Dolan Falls and Three Tier Rapids are not able to be seen until you are right on top of them. After Three Tier Rapids, there are no more large (over class III) rapids and the river is fairly smooth. Some boulder and fields do occur past Three Tier Rapids but are generally small in size. The river finally empties into Lake Amistad after traveling some from Bakers Crossing. From this point it is another trip on the lake to the last take out at Rough Canyon Marina. The journey for the lake section of the trip can be very strenuous on a person kayaking or canoeing because of the strong south headwind. Sunset Route, Castle Canyon, Texas (postcard, circa 1908) =The experience= Part of the appeal of the river is its remote location, the very rugged and rough terrain, and lack of human presence.

He also distinguished himself as a Methodist Circuit rider, Pastor, and Presiding Elder, and as an Editor. Early life and family Thomas was born near Charleston (then in Virginia, now in West Virginia). He was the son of John and Margaret Morris, who settled on the Kanawha River about 1785. Thomas' early education was obtained in the common schools, later pursuing special studies in a school taught by a William Paine, an Englishman. Before reaching manhood Thomas served three years as an assistant in the office of his brother Edmund, who was County Clerk. At the age of eighteen, Thomas was drafted to serve a six- month term in the War of 1812. Owing to his youth, however, his family obtained a substitute for him, thereby allowing him to avoid military service (as was common in that day). Conversion and ministry For some years Morris was a religious skeptic. His parents were of the Baptist faith. But in 1813, when Thomas was converted to the Christian faith, he united with the Methodist Episcopal (M.E.) Church. Thomas was licensed to preach 2 April 1814 and was ordained circa 1820 by Methodist Bishop Robert Richford Roberts. After serving as a Supply Pastor on a Methodist circuit, the Rev. Morris was admitted into the newly formed Ohio Annual Conference of the M.E. Church, September 1816. Over the next two years, the Rev. Thomas Asbury Morris traveled ca. 5,500 miles on horseback, preaching some 500 times. During the first twelve years of his ministry he received a mere $2,000 in wages. As a preacher he was concise, clear, instructive, and even sometimes eloquent. His health suffered from his hard labor and exposure in early ministry. In 1820 he was placed in a supernumerary relation, but was sent to Lancaster, Ohio (at that time, a newly constituted station). Subsequently, Rev. Morris was transferred to the Kentucky Annual Conference. In 1824 he was first elected a delegate to General Conference. He would be elected to every General Conference thereafter until his election to the Episcopacy. In 1826 he was appointed Presiding Elder of the Green River District. That year he also suffered from a shock of paralysis, and was afterwards transferred back to the Ohio Conference. In spite of impaired health, however, he remained a dedicated student and a wide reader. After having been stationed in Cincinnati for several years, he was, in 1833, appointed Presiding Elder of the Cincinnati District. In April 1834 he was appointed Editor of the Western Christian Advocate, an important periodical of his denomination, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. As early as 1835 he was known to be an advocate of total abstinence (from alcoholic beverage). The Rev. Thomas Asbury Morris was elected to the Episcopacy of the M.E. Church by the 1836 General Conference. He was diligent and faithful in the discharge of all his duties, traveling extensively through the circuit of the Annual Conferences, which then embraced the whole of the settled part of the U.S.A. In 1844, when the church divided North and South over the issue of slavery, Bishop Morris remained in the Methodist Episcopal Church (the northern branch), notwithstanding that Virginia was his native State. Needless to say, he regretted the separation deeply. The division was healed in 1939 when the M.E. Church, the M.E. Church, South, and the M.P. Church reunited to form the Methodist Church. In 1968 the Methodist Church merged with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to form the United Methodist Church. For sixteen years of his thirty-six total years in the Episcopacy, Bishop Morris was Senior Bishop of his denomination (following the death of Bishop Waugh in 1858). He was practical, witty, and blunt, but kind. His spirit was said to be indomitable, and he possessed charming simplicity, both of taste and manner. McKendree University gave him the (honorary) degree of D.D. in 1841. Later years and death For several years Bishop Morris was in impaired health, able to do but little official work. Consequently, the General Conference voted to relieve him from any regular duties. His last illness lasted a little over a week. He died 2 September 1874 in Springfield, Ohio.

Shot entirely at the Cinecitt√† studios in Rome, the film won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design, with the Oscar going to Danilo Donati. The film portrays Casanova's life as a journey into sexual abandonment. The narrative presents Casanova's adventures in a detached, methodical fashion, as the respect for which he yearns is constantly undermined by his more basic urges. Plot The film opens with a carnival in Venice as a prelude to a series of erotic encounters that follow Giacomo Casanova through the cities of 18th-century Europe. The organizers of the festival attempt to raise a gigantic bust from the water; this fails, which is taken as a bad omen. Casanova is then introduced, as he visits one of Venice's islands to copulate with a fake nun for the pleasure of a rich voyeur; Casanova succeeds in entertaining him, but is frustrated that the man finds no interest in his research into alchemy and his further scheming. As he rows back to the mainland, Casanova is arrested, judged and imprisoned by the High Court over his famed debauchery. During his time in prison, Casanova reminisces of his affairs with a dressmaker and later on with one of her junior employees, Anna Maria, who suffers from frequent fainting and requires constant bloodletting. He eventually consummates his desire for Anna Maria. Back in prison, Casanova escapes through the roof and exiles himself from Venice, being taken into the Paris court of Madame d'Urf√©. The Madame, an aged woman, enthralled by Casanova's apparent knowledge of alchemy, wishes to transform her soul into a man's through ritualistic intercourse with him (an act that requires the presence of a younger woman in the room, so that Casanova can get aroused). Fortuitously, Casanova encounters his brother, whose girlfriend he entices away. Casanova then moves to the court of a hunchback, Du Bois, in between taking charge of a beautiful girl‚Äî\\"the love of [his] life\\"‚ÄîHenriette. Du Bois puts on a homosexual theatrical performance for his guests that unsettles some of them; Casanova is brought to tears as Henriette plays some music. The lovers vow fidelity to each other, but the following morning Henriette has disappeared. Du Bois informs Casanova that an emissary of a far-away court has reclaimed Henriette, and she's left a request that Casanova not attempt to follow her. While in London, Casanova is robbed by two women and he attempts suicide by drowning himself in the Thames. A vision of a giantess and two dwarves distracts him; he follows them to a frost fair, where he arm-wrestles the giantess‚Äîa princess‚Äîand later pays to watch her bathe with the dwarves. Casanova resumes his travelling the following day. He attends a deranged party at Lord Talou's palace in Rome, where he wins a bet with a stagecoach driver, Righetto, over how many orgasms he can have in one hour. The competition brings him higher acclaim. In Switzerland he falls in love with an alchemist's daughter, Isabella, who fails to keep an appointment to go to Dresden with him; Casanova instead partakes in an orgy within the hostel he's been stranded in. In Dresden, he has a brief chance encounter with his estranged mother in a theater. He then moves to a court in W√ºrttemberg, where his desire to be taken seriously as a writer/inventor is frustrated by the court's orgiastic, wild nature. It is here that he meets Rosalba, a mechanical doll with whom he shares a dance and later on goes to bed with. Time goes by and an old Casanova finds himself librarian to Count Waldstein at his castle in Dux. Life at the castle is more than frustrating for Casanova, as he is made to eat with other servants and does not get the respect nor the food he claims to deserve. Waldstein's manservant, Faulkircher, and his lover Vidarol, make him an object of mockery and animosity. A portrait of him is hanged and defecated on. Later on, during a fervent poetry recital, a court member fails to suppress a giggle at Casanova, who, humiliated and disappointed, goes back up to his room. The final scene has a weary, bloodshot Casanova cringing in an armchair and recounting a recent dream. In this dream, Casanova is back in Venice. He catches a glimpse of the giant bust seen in the beginning of the film, buried under thick layers of ice in the lagoon. He chases the ghosts of his past lovers, all of whom disappear. An ornate stagecoach beckons him to join its passengers. He finally meets with Rosalba, the mechanical doll, once again. They quietly dance with each other.

Jack Nicholson, Marcello Mastroianni, Alberto Sordi and Gian Maria Volont√© were also considered for the role. When De Laurentiis bowed out of the project and Fellini signed a new contract with producer Alberto Grimaldi, Donald Sutherland was cast in the role, requiring that he shave his head and wear both prosthetic nose and chin. Fellini had to re-shoot parts of this movie, including the elaborate Venice carnival scene, when approximately seventy reels of film‚Äîincluding the first three weeks of shooting‚Äîwere stolen at the Technicolor labs of Tiburtino, Rome, on August 27, 1975. The thieves were apparently interested in Pasolini's Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975), and some reels of this film were also stolen, along with half of Damiano Damiani's spaghetti western A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe (1975). Music was composed by Nino Rota, a frequent Fellini collaborator. Style Fellini‚Äôs Casanova is noted for its symbolic, highly stylised mise en sc√®ne and the casting of Donald Sutherland in the lead role. By using a range of visual effects, Fellini attempted to depict Casanova as a debauched figure incapable of displaying any genuine emotion. This Felliniesque style is most noticeable in Sutherland's acting and appearance, which was made overtly graphic at the director's request. Other unusual techniques include a scene where Sutherland rows across a stormy sea made from black plastic sheets. Fellini's dislike of the character was well documented, and in one interview he even referred to exposing \\"the void\\" of Casanova's life. Consequently, Fellini's interpretation goes against the traditional notion of Casanova as an enlightened gadabout. The original script was very brutal on the historical figure. It wasn't until Fellini shot the scene of Casanova and the nun that he began to sympathize with Casanova's inability to love, giving him the character of the mechanical doll and the dream ending.

Amid Fellini's characteristic combination of dreamlike, outrageous, and artistic imagery, Marcello Mastroianni plays Sn√†poraz, a man who voyages through male and female spaces toward a confrontation with his own attitudes toward women and his wife. Plot Sn√†poraz wakes up during a train ride and has a brief fling with a woman in the bathroom, but it's cut short when the train suddenly stops and the woman gets off. Sn√†poraz follows her into the woods, through the wilderness and into a Grand Hotel overrun with women in attendance for a surrealistic feminist convention. He winds up in a conference about polyandry, where his presence is rejected. A frightened Sn√†poraz retreats to the hotel lobby, but the exit is blocked; instead he seeks refuge inside an elevator with a girl, Donatella, who offers her assistance. Donatella leads Sn√†poraz into a gymnasium and forces him to don roller skates. He is yet again cornered and berated by a group of angry women who circle around him in roller skates and practice testicle-kicking with a dummy. Dazed, Sn√†poraz makes his exit down a flight of stairs, falling down and badly hurting himself, and into the domain of a burly woman tending to the hotel's furnace. The woman showers and offers him a ride to the train station on her motorcycle, but stops by a farm and lures Sn√†poraz into a nursery, where she tries to rape him. The rape is cut short by the woman's mother, who steps in to chastise her daughter, and Sn√†poraz decides to follow instead a lonely woman through the country side. He joins her and her girlfriends on a car ride on the promise of being delivered to the station, but the ride goes on well into the night and all they do is hang out high on drugs and listen to Italo disco. A frustrated Sn√†poraz ditches them and is harassed by two more cars until he finds shelter in the off-limits private property of Dr. Xavier Katzone, who hails gunfire on his persecutors. Dr. Katzone promises to deliver Sn√†poraz to the train station the following morning and invites him to stay on for a party. Sn√†poraz walks around Katzone's extravagant household, which is filled with sexual imagery and suggestive, phallic sculptures. He is also fascinated by his collection of sexual conquests hanging as photographs from the manor walls that light up and whisper arousing dialogue at the flick of a switch. Taking pride in his many inventions, Katzone celebrates his 10,000th conquest with an eccentric party that involves the blowing out of 10,000 candles and a performance by his wife, in which she sucks coins and pearls into her vagina by means of telekinesis. During the party, Sn√†poraz comes across his ex-wife, Elena, who has a drunken argument with him, and meets Donatella again. The police (composed solely of women dressed in Nazi attire) arrive, interrupting Katzone mid-song, and announce the imminent demolition of his house. They also inform him that they have shot one of his dogs, Italo, his most beloved. A grieved Katzone buries him. Meanwhile, Sn√†poraz dances to Fred Astaire with Donatella and a friend of hers (who are both dressed in scanty clothing), but fails to sleep with either of them, instead getting stuck with his ex in bed. Hearing strange noises, he crawls under the bed, entering another dream-like world in which he slides down a toboggan, revisiting his childhood crushes (a sitter, a nurse, a prostitute) along the way. Caged at the end of the slide, he is transported before a strange court and judged for his masculinity. Although dismissed to go free, he decides to confront his tentative punishment, and escalates a towering boxing ring before a feminine crowd. At the top of the ring he climbs into a hot air balloon in the form of Donatella. Donatella herself fires at him from below with a machine-gun, bursting the balloon and sending Sn√†poraz plummeting to apparent death. Sn√†poraz then wakes up on the very same train from the beginning of the film, showing the story to have been a mere nightmare. Just as he comes to this conclusion, he realizes his glasses are broken (as in his dream) and that the wagon is filled by the women that crowded his dream. The train races into a tunnel and the film ends.

Corriere della Sera critic Giovanni Grazzini interpreted the film as \\"a catalogue of emotions, sometimes grotesque, sometimes farcical, which provides a few caustic jibes against the destruction of femininity by aggressive feminism... From a stylistic point of view, it's less homogeneous than usual but other parts of the film are delightful. For instance, when fantasy is used to create types of people rather than caricatures. In this sense Fellini, having abandoned his gallery of monsters, becomes more prosaic. Or when the ambiguity of certain characters - an excellent example is the soubrette played by the charming Donatella Damiani - provides a touch of grace and bitchiness; or when the film becomes almost a musical; or when paradox becomes surrealist, such as the party and the hurricane at the villa of Katzone who's in despair because his favourite dog has died\\".Review first published in Corriere della Sera (Rome) on 29 March 1980. Fava and Vigano, 179 \\"Fellini appears as the Madame Bovary of his adolescence\\", wrote Claudio G. Fava for Corriere Mercantile. \\"He revels in the enjoyment he feels at working with an experienced crew, side by side with faithful technicians who simulate trains on the move or the sea washing the shores of the inevitable Romagnol beaches as though they were working of the set of George M√©li√®s. But then, again and again, Fellini has shown us that he is the greatest and most ingenious of M√©li√®s' heirs. Only the magic does not always work, especially in the attempt to create a kind of astonished confession of amused impotence when faced with the new woman of today, together with a feeling of nostalgia for the old woman of the past... Despite Fellini's extraordinary virtuosity, the film rarely achieves harmony of inspiration, of order, of strip-cartoon fantasy, or of irony.\\"Review first published in Corriere Mercantile (Genoa) on 4 April 1980. Fava and Vigano, 180 Francesco Bolzoni of L'Avvenire insisted that Fellini was \\"only playing games. But then we would hardly expect from Fellini a deep analysis of the nature of women... It is a game with occasional gaps and, more often, inventions that rejuvenate an all too familiar, all too hackneyed subject. A surprising serenity predominates... It is a film with a tragic vein that in the end proves to be light-hearted and occasionally amusing\\".Review first published in L'Avvenire (Milan) on 29 March 1980. Fava and Vigano, 179 La Notte magazine's Giorgio Carbone felt the maestro had \\"finally reached a splendid maturity that permits him to lavish his treasures upon us for the simple pleasure of doing so. Behind the festival of images and colours we can feel his delight in making this film, a delight which, from the very first scene, becomes ours too, and it's something we haven't felt in a long time... If the film lacks suspense in its story (we care little what happens to Sn√†poraz or Katzone because we know that sooner or later Rimini and those bosomy extras will appear on the scene), there's suspense in the images and in the scenic inventions\\".First published in La Notte (Milan) on 29 March 1980. Fava and Vigano, 178-79 Screened out of competition on 19 May 1980 at the 33rd Cannes Film Festival, the film was badly received by the majority of French critics, some of whom offered review titles such as \\"Zero for Fellini\\", \\"A Tiring Deception\\", \\"A Disaster\\", as well as \\"A Mountain of Tedious Pretension\\". Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky, in Rome that year for the pre- production of Nostalghia, noted in his diary that City of Women was a fiasco: \\"At the Cannes Festival the papers said that Fellini's last film was a total disaster, and that he himself had ceased to exist. It's terrible, but it's true, his film is worthless.\\"Diary entry dated 6 June 1980. Tarkovsky, 256 ;United States Released by New Yorker Films in the United States on 8 April 1981, the film garnered generally favorable reviews but little box-office success.Alpert, 277 Daniel Talbot of New Yorker Films offered an explanation for the public's lack of interest: \\"Here, it played in less than fifty theatres, and of those, six provided 75 percent of the earnings. I don't know what Gaumont or Fellini could have expected with that kind of personal film. He had lost most of his audience here by then. Which isn't to say that I don't think him one of the great filmmakers of the world.\\" For Vincent Canby of The New York Times, however, the film was a success: \\"Though the film is overlong, even for a Fellini aficionado, it is spell-binding, a dazzling visual display that is part burlesque, part satire, part Folies-Berg√®re, and all cinema. As Sn√†poraz is haunted by the phantoms of all the women he has known, or wanted to know, from childhood on, Mr Fellini in City of Women is obsessed by his own feelings toward women, by his need for them, his treatment (mostly poor) of them, his continued fascination by them and his awareness that (thank heavens) they'll always be different... Though City of Women is about a libertine, it's anything but licentious. Mr Fellini's licentiousness suggests a profound longing for some kind of protective discipline, if not complete chastity. As such discipline would destroy Sn√†poraz, it would make impossible the conception and production of a film as wonderfully uninhibited as City of Women.\\"First published in The New York Times on 8 April 1981. Fava and Vigano, 180 John Gould Boyum of The Wall Street Journal observed that \\"the film's entire thrust has little or nothing to do with the striking of attitudes, the analyzing of ideas. What Fellini seems after here is the recording and communicating of a set of feelings: those complex, contradictory ones experienced by a middle-aged Italian male suddenly faced with a cataclysmic upheaval in social and sexual mores... We do not go to Fellini to immerse ourselves in story and character or to encounter ideas. What we want from the maestro and what he gives us are fabulous adventures in feeling - a decidedly original mixture of nostalgia, poignancy, and joy that is unmistakably Fellini's own.\\"First published in The Wall Street Journal on 17 April 1981.

It was serialized in Shueisha's manga magazine Ribon from July 1982 to October 1994. An anime television series directed by Hiroshi Sasagawa was adapted from the manga and was broadcast on Nippon TV from October 7, 1982 to September 22, 1983. Plot 15-year-old Ranze Eto lives in an isolated castle in Japan with her werewolf mother, vampire father, and younger brother, Rinze. Despite her lineage, she has yet to demonstrate any special powers of her own, and her parents are worried she might be a normal girl. One day, Ranze's innate power finally manifests itself when she, quite by accident, discovers that she can change herself into a carbon copy of any object she bites, whether it be a person or an inanimate object like a piece of bread, and can return to her normal self only by sneezing. Her parents are overjoyed, but Ranze's new powers make it difficult to continue living life as a normal teenage girl. On Ranze's first day at her new school in junior high, she meets and falls in love with the brash yet handsome young athlete, Shun Makabe. The chief problem with this is that Ranze's parents will not allow her to date a human - although there may be much more to Shun than meets the eye. On top of this, she also has a bitter rival in the pretty but spiteful Yoko Kamiya (the daughter of a yakuza boss) who also likes Shun and doesn't take kindly to Ranze's intruding on her turf. =Final anime episode= Since the anime series ended years before the manga, the writers had to create an original ending. This leaves the story open- ended. In the last episode, it had Shun being discovered of a star birthmark, proving that he is actually the long lost prince of the Demon World. Ranze is thrilled by the news, meaning she'll be able to marry him. However, when confronted by the King, Shun denies being the long-lost-prince and claiming the star as a bruise. The King bans the Eto Family from the Demon World, until they can bring back his long-lost-son. When Shun returns home, his mother reveals that the star is actually a birthmark and he realizes that he's the true long lost prince of the Demon World, and the Eto family were right about it all along. The following morning, Shun tries to talk to Ranze about that star on the way to school, but Yoko ends up interrupting the conversation. The series closed with a special ending, with not only Ranze but the main cast dancing (in cloaks) to the ending, \\"Super Love Lotion\\".

It is one of the Bank of England Acts 1694 to 1892.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and Schedule 2 Purpose Until the mid-nineteenth century, commercial banks in Britain and Ireland were able to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation. Under the 1844 Act, bullionism was institutionalized in Britain,Anna Gambles, Protection and Politics: Conservative Economic Discourse, 1815-1852 (Royal Historical Society/Boydell Press, 1999), pp. 117-18. creating a ratio between the gold reserves held by the Bank of England and the notes that the Bank could issue, and limited the issuance by English and Welsh banks of non-gold-backed Bank of England notes to up to ¬£14 million. The Act also placed strict curbs on the issuance of notes by the country banks, barring any new \\"banks of issue\\" in any part of the United Kingdom and thus beginning the process of centralizing banknote issuance. The Act was a victory for the British Currency School, who argued that the issue of new banknotes was a major cause of price inflation. Although the Act required new notes to be backed fully by gold or government debt, the government retained the power to suspend the Act in case of financial crisis, and this in fact happened several times: in 1847 and 1857, and during the 1866 Overend Gurney crisis. Also, while the act restricted the supply of new notes, it did not restrict the creation of new bank deposits, and these would continue to increase in size over the course of the 19th century. Bank deposits are sums of money that a bank, backed by considerable collateral, may choose to deposit in the holder‚Äôs account as a loan which requires repayment with interest. The money comes into existence when the bank creates the deposit, and when the loan is paid off, the money disappears from the bank‚Äôs balance sheet. While a loan is effectively a cash advance provided by the bank to the customer, in the long term the effect of unrestricted creation of bank deposits (money) can lead to inflation in the markets into which that money is channelled, such as the property market through banks' mortgage lending. As a result of the Act, as provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes. The English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank of England with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was Fox, Fowler and Company in 1921. The Bank Notes (Scotland) Act 1845 adopted a year later was more lenient, allowing banks in Scotland to issue more than their 1845 circulation amount, as long as the additional circulation was backed pound-for-pound with gold reserves at head office. Merging banks were also allowed to combine their issues. Today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own sterling banknotes, regulated by the Bank of England. Banking Act 2009 The Banking Act 2009 abolished the \\"weekly return\\" of the number of banknotes issued by the Bank of England: \\"Section 6 of the Bank Charter Act 1844 (Bank to produce weekly account) shall cease to have effect\\".

Emeritus Distinguished CSU Professor of Writing and Aesthetics at Western Connecticut State University, Briggs lives in Granville, Massachusetts, where he has served as a Selectman and a police officer. Themes Holistic approaches to nature, art and indigenous traditions, and reflections on the ways that human consciousness experiences the whole. His early work explored metaphor as a holistic deep structure principle in the arts. More recently, he has linked this metaphor principle to the holistic (holomorphic) mode of consciousness utilized by Native American and other Indigenous cultures. He has advanced the theory that a primal form of ambivalence fulminates at the core of consciousness: the irresolvable paradox between our existence as separate individuals and our existence as inseparable from the whole. His work includes critiques of reductionist assumptions in science, in arts theory, and in anthropocentric thinking generally. Education and career Briggs, son of psychiatrist John Briggs, Sr. and psychologist-musician Muriel Ann Briggs, received his B.A. in 1968 from The College of Letters, Wesleyan University, Honors and cum laude; his M.A. in 1972 in literature from New York University, and his Ph.D. in 1981 in aesthetics and psychology from The Union Institute and University. He taught on the Humanities Faculty at the New School for Social Research from 1973-1984, and was an adjunct professor of English at Brooklyn College (1974) and Mercy College (1974-1987). Since 2003 he has been an on-line scholar in residence at The Institute for Educational Studies, Endicott College Master of Education Program in Integrative Learning (Montessori). Briggs spent 25 years as a faculty member at Western Connecticut State University, beginning in 1987 as the Journalism Coordinator for the English Department. He became full professor in 1995, and in 2000 was chosen as one of 12 CSU Distinguished Professors of the four-campus Connecticut State University system. At WestConn he served as English Department co-chair in 2003-2007, was a principal designer of both the Master of Fine Arts program in Creative and Professional Writing and the Department of Writing, Linguistics, and Creative Process, which was split off from the English Department in 2007. From 2004-2008 he served as the senior editor for the national literary magazine, Connecticut Review. Teaching literature, his specialties were the modernist novels of writers such as Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, Franz Kafka, Jorge Luis Borges, and Joseph Conrad. In the Writing Department, he taught aesthetics and creative process. Shortly before retiring from teaching in 2012, Briggs helped to found the Center for Compassion, Creativity and Innovation at Westconn. Briggs is a former fellow at The Black Earth Institute , a member of the Society for Consciousness Studies , and of the Contemplative Alliance , an offshoot of the Global Peace Initiative of Women. Briggs began his professional career as a writer after three years of high school, working as a news reporter for The Tarrytown Daily News, and later the Hartford Courant, as a police reporter during the 1967 riots in Hartford.

The mountains, particularly South Sister, are popular destinations for climbing and scrambling. Although they are often grouped together as one unit, the three mountains have their own individual geology and eruptive history. Neither nor has erupted in the last 14,000 years, and it is considered unlikely that either will ever erupt again. last erupted about 2,000 years ago and could erupt in the future, threatening life within the region. After satellite imagery detected tectonic uplift near in 2000, the United States Geological Survey improved monitoring in the immediate area. Geography The Three Sisters are at the boundary of Lane and Deschutes counties and the Willamette and Deschutes national forests in the U.S. state of Oregon, about south of the nearest town of Sisters. The three peaks are the third-, fourth-, and fifth-highest in Oregon, and contain 16 named glaciers. Their ice volume totals . The Sisters were named Faith, Hope and Charity by early settlers, but are now known as North Sister, Middle Sister and South Sister, respectively. = Wilderness= The Three Sisters Wilderness covers an area of , making it the second-largest wilderness area in Oregon. Designated by the United States Congress in 1964, it borders the Mount Washington Wilderness to the north and shares its southern edge with the Waldo Lake Wilderness. The area includes of trails and many forests, lakes, waterfalls, and streams, including the source of Whychus Creek. The Three Sisters and nearby Broken Top account for about a third of the Three Sisters Wilderness, and this area is known as the Alpine Crest Region. Rising from about to in elevation, the Alpine Crest Region features the wilderness area's most-frequented glaciers, lakes, and meadows. = Physical geography = alt=An aerial image displays Middle Sister on the left and South Sister to the right above the vegetation of the Three Sisters Wilderness. Weather varies greatly in the area due to the rain shadow caused by the Cascade Range. Air from the Pacific Ocean rises over the western slopes, which causes it to cool and dump its moisture as rain (or snow in the winter). Precipitation increases with elevation. Once the moisture is wrung from the air, it descends on the eastern side of the crest, which causes the air to be warmer and drier. On the western slopes, precipitation ranges from annually, while precipitation over the eastern slopes varies from in the east. Temperature extremes reach in summers and during the winters. The Three Sisters have about 130 snowfields and glaciers ranging in altitude from with a cumulative surface area of about . The Linn and Villard Glaciers are north of the North Sister Summit, while the Thayer Glacier is on its eastern slope. The Collier Glacier is nestled between North Sister and Middle Sister and flows to the northwest. The Renfrew and Hayden Glaciers are the northwestern and northeastern slopes of Middle Sister, respectively, while the Diller Glacier is on its southeastern slope. The Irving, Carver and Skinner Glaciers lie between Middle Sister and South Sister. Finally, around the summit of South Sister, in a clockwise direction, are the Prouty, Lewis, Clark, Lost Creek, and Eugene Glaciers. The Collier Glacier, despite a retreat and a 64% loss of its surface area between 1910 and 1994, is generally considered to be the largest of the Three Sisters at . Eliot Glacier on Mount Hood is now two-and-a-half times larger than the Collier Glacier. According to sources, the Prouty Glacier is sometimes considered to be larger than the Collier glacier. alt=A snow-covered lake surrounded by dark glacial till When Little Ice Age glaciers retreated during the 20th century, water filled in the spaces left behind, forming moraine- dammed lakes, which are more common in the Three Sisters Wilderness than anywhere else in the contiguous United States. The local area has a history of flash floods, including an event on October 7, 1966, caused by a sudden avalanche; this flash flood reached the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway. Concerned about the hazard of similar flooding events, scientists in the 1980s from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) identified that Carver Lake on South Sister could flood and breach its natural dam, producing a large mudflow that could endanger wilderness visitors and the town of Sisters. Studies at Collier Lake and Diller Lake suggested that both had breached their dams in the early 1940s and in 1970, respectively. Other moraine-dammed lakes within the wilderness area include Thayer Lake on North Sister's east flank and four members of the Chambers Lakes group between Middle and South Sister. Before settlement of the area at the end of the 19th century, wildfires frequently burned through the local forests, especially the ponderosa pine forests on the eastern slopes. Due to fire suppression over the past century, the forests have become overgrown, and at higher elevations, they are further susceptible to summertime fires, which threaten surrounding life and property. In the 21st century, wildfires have been larger and more common in the Deschutes National Forest. In September 2012, a lightning strike caused a fire that burned in the Pole Creek area within the Three Sisters Wilderness, leaving the area closed until May 2013. In August 2017, officials closed in the western half of the Three Sisters Wilderness, including of the Pacific Crest Trail, to the public because of 11 lightning-caused fires, including the Milli Fire. As a result of the increasing incidence of fires, public officials have factored the role of wildfire into planning, including organizing prescribed fires with scientists to protect habitats at risk while minimizing adverse effects on air quality and environmental health. Geology alt=The Three Sisters are in a north- south row of major volcanoes in Oregon. From north to south: Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters, Crater Lake, and Mounth McLoughlin. Newberry Volcano is displaced to the east, between Three Sisters and Crater Lake The Three Sisters join several other volcanoes in the eastern segment of the Cascade Range known as the High Cascades, which trends north‚Äìsouth. Constructed towards the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north‚Äìsouth faulting in the surrounding region. Part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range, each of the three volcanoes formed at different times from several variable magmatic sources. The amount of rhyolite present in the lavas of the younger two mountains is unusual relative to nearby peaks. The Three Sisters form the leading edge of a rhyolitic crustal-melting anomaly, which might be explained by a combination of mantle flow (movement of Earth's solid silicate mantle layer caused by convection currents) and decompression that has generated similar melting and rhyolitic volcanism nearby for the past 16 million years. Like other Cascade volcanoes, the Three Sisters were fed by magma chambers produced by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the western edge of the North American tectonic plate. The three mountains were also shaped by the changing climate of the Pleistocene epoch, during which multiple glacial periods occurred and glacial advance eroded the mountains. alt=A rough-textured light-colored lava dome, with a volcanic peak behind The Three Sisters form the center of a region of closely grouped volcanic peaks. This is in contrast to the typical spacing between volcanoes elsewhere in the Cascades. Among the most active volcanic areas in the Cascades and one of the most densely populated volcanic centers in the world, the Three Sisters region includes nearby peaks such as Belknap Crater, Mount Washington, Black Butte, and Three Fingered Jack to the north, and Broken Top and Mount Bachelor to the south. Most of the surrounding volcanoes consist of mafic (basaltic) lavas; only South and Middle Sister have an abundance of silicic rocks such as andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite. Mafic magma is less viscous; it produces lava flows and is less prone to explosive eruptions than silicic magma. The region was active in the Pleistocene, with eruptions between about 650,000 and about 250,000 years ago from an explosively active complex known as the Tumalo volcanic center. This area features andesitic and mafic cinder cones such as Lava Butte, as well as rhyolite domes. Cinder cones accumulate from the airfall of many pyroclastic rock fragments of various sizes, while the viscous rhyolite domes extrude onto the surface like toothpaste. The Tumalo volcano spread ignimbrites and plinian deposits in ground eruptions across the area, similar to the eruption of Vesuvius that destroyed Pompeii. These deposits spread from Tumalo to the town of Bend. Basaltic lava flows from North Sister overlay the youngest Tumalo pyroclastic deposits, indicating that North Sister was active more recently than 260,000 years ago. = North Sister = alt=The highly eroded North Sister volcano sits above a forested area, with some ice and snow visible scattered across the mountain. North Sister, also known as \\"Faith\\", is the oldest and most highly eroded of the three, with zigzagging rock pinnacles between glaciers. It is a shield volcano that overlays a more ancient shield volcano named Little Brother. North Sister is wide, and its summit elevation is . Consisting primarily of basaltic andesite, it has a more mafic composition than the other two volcanoes. Its deposits are rich in palagonite and red and black cinders, and they are progressively more iron-rich the younger they are. North Sister's lava flows demonstrate similar compositions throughout the mountain's long eruptive history. The oldest lava flows on North Sister have been dated to roughly 311,000 years ago, though the oldest reliably dated deposits are approximately 119,000 years old. Estimates place the volcano's last eruption at 46,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. North Sister possesses more dikes than any similar Cascade peak, caused by lava intruding into pre- existing rocks. Many of these dikes were pushed aside by the intrusion of a -wide volcanic plug. The dikes and plug were exposed by centuries of erosion. At one point, the volcano stood more than high, but erosion reduced this volume by a quarter to a third. The plug is now exposed and forms North Sister's summits at Prouty Peak and the South Horn. = Middle Sister = alt=Middle Sister, covered in snow and ice, rises above a sparsely forested area. Middle Sister, also known as \\"Hope\\", is a basaltic stratovolcano that has also erupted more-viscous andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite. The smallest and least studied of the three, Middle Sister began eruptive activity 48,000 years ago, and it was primarily built by eruptions occurring between 25,000 and 18,000 years ago. One of the earliest major eruptive events (about 38,000 years ago) produced the rhyolite of Obsidian Cliffs on the mountain's northwestern flank. Thick and rich in dacite, the flows extended from the northern and southern sides. They stand in contrast to older, andesitic lava remains that reach as far as from its base. With an elevation of , the mountain is cone-shaped. The eastern side has been heavily eroded by glaciation, while the western face is mostly intact. Of the Three Sisters, Middle Sister has the largest ice cover. The Hayden and Diller glaciers continue to cut into the east face, while the Renfrew Glacier sits on the northwestern slope. The large but retreating , which contains of ice and is the thickest and largest glacier in the region, descends along the north side of Middle Sister, cutting into the west side of North Sister. Erosion from Pleistocene and Holocene glaciation exposed a plug near the center of Middle Sister. = South Sister = alt=South Sister, which features patches of snow and ice, can be seen above a plain. Forest is visible in the foreground. South Sister, also known as \\"Charity\\", is the tallest volcano of the trio, standing at . The eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a predominantly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying an older shield structure. Its modern structure is no more than 50,000 years old, and it last erupted about 2,000 years ago. Although its first eruptive events from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago were predominantly rhyolitic, between 38,000 and 32,000 years ago the volcano began to alternate between dacitic/rhyodacitic and rhyolitic eruptions. The volcano built a broad andesitic cone, forming a steep summit cone of andesite about 27,000 years ago. South Sister remained dormant for 15,000 years, after which its composition shifted from dacitic to more rhyolitic lava. An eruptive episode about 2,200 years ago, termed the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread volcanic ash from flank vents from the south and southwest flanks, followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow. Next, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle consisted of explosive ash eruptions followed by viscous rhyolitic lava flows. Unlike the previous eruptive period, it was caused by the intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from 20 vents on the southeast side and from a smaller line on the north side. These eruptions generated pyroclastic flows and lava domes from vents on the northern, southern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the volcano. These relatively recent, postglacial eruptions suggest the presence of a silicic magma reservoir under South Sister, one that could perhaps lead to future eruptions. alt=A small pool of water in a snowfield with other peaks in the mist receding in the distance Unlike its sister peaks, South Sister has an uneroded summit crater about in diameter that holds a small crater lake known as Teardrop Pool, the highest lake in Oregon. Its cone consists of basaltic andesite along with red scoria and tephra, with exposed black and red inner walls made of scoria. Hodge Crest, a false peak, formed between 28,000 and 24,000 years ago, roughly around the same time as the main cone. Despite its relatively young age, every part of South Sister other than its peak has undergone significant erosion due to Pleistocene and Holocene glaciation. Between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, South Sister's southern flanks were covered with ice streams, and a small amount of ice extended below . On the volcano's northern flank, below the summit peak, erosion from these glaciers exposed a headwall about high. During the Holocene, smaller glaciers formed, alternating between advance and retreat, depositing moraines and till between on the mountain. The Lewis and Clark glaciers have cirques, or glacial valleys, that made the outer walls of the crater rim significantly steeper. The slopes of South Sister contain small glaciers, including the Lost Creek and Prouty glaciers. = Recent history and potential hazards = When the first geological reconnaissance of the Three Sisters region was published in 1925, its author, Edwin T. Hodge, suggested that the Three Sisters and five smaller mountains in the present-day wilderness area were the remains of an enormous collapsed volcano that had been active during the Miocene or early Pliocene epochs. Naming this ancient volcano Mount Multnomah, Hodge theorized that it had collapsed to form a caldera just as Mount Mazama collapsed to form Crater Lake. In the 1940s, Howel Williams completed an analysis of the Three Sisters vicinity and concluded that Multnomah had never existed, instead demonstrating that each volcano in the area possessed its own individual eruptive history. Williams' 1944 paper defined the basic outline of the Three Sisters vicinity, though he lacked access to chemical techniques and radiometric dating. Over the past 70 years, scientists have published several reconnaissance maps and petrographic studies of the Three Sisters, including a detailed geological map published in 2012. Map of hazards from the Three Sisters showing risk of lava flows and alt=Map showing high lava risk immediately near the volcanoes, with risk of lahars flowing down rivers to towns nearby Neither North nor Middle Sister is likely to resume volcanic activity. An eruption from South Sister would pose a threat to nearby life, as the proximal danger zone extends from the volcano's summits. During an eruption, tephra could accumulate to in the city of Bend, and mudflows and pyroclastic flows could run down the sides of the mountain, threatening any life in their paths. Eruptions from South Sister could be either explosive or effusive, though an eruption of ash with local volcanic rock accumulation and slow lava flows is considered most likely. The Three Sisters area does not have fumarole activity, although there are hot springs west of South Sister. From 1986 to 1987, the USGS surveyed the Three Sisters vicinity with tilt- leveling networks and electro-optical distance meters, but South Sister was not the subject of close geodetic analysis for the next two decades. The volcano was found to be potentially active in 2000, when satellite imagery showed a deforming tectonic uplift west of the mountain. The ground began to bulge in late 1997, as magma started to pool about underground. Scientists became concerned that the volcano was awakening, but examination of interferograms, or diagrams of patterns formed by wave interference, revealed that only small amounts of deformation occurred. A 2002 study inferred that the composition of intruding magma was basaltic or rhyolitic. A map at the Lava Lands Visitor Center of the Newberry National Volcanic Monument south of Bend shows the extent of the uplift, which reaches a maximum of . In 2004, an earthquake swarm occurred with an epicenter in the area of uplift; the hundreds of small earthquakes subsided after several days. According to a 2011 study, this swarm may have initiated a significant decrease in the peak uplift rate, which dropped by 80 percent after 2004. By 2007 the uplift had slowed, though the area was still considered potentially active. A study published in 2010 described the magma intrusion as having a volume of about . Scientists determined in 2013 that the uplift had slowed to a rate of about per year, compared to up to per year in the early 2000s. Because of the uplift at South Sister, the USGS planned to increase monitoring of the Three Sisters and their vicinity by installing a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, sampling airborne and ground-based gases, and adding seismometers. The agency completed a GPS survey campaign, including planning, documentation, and data processing and archiving, at South Sister in 2001, as well as annual InSAR radar observations from 1992 to 2001, and it followed up with campaign GPS and tilt- leveling surveys in August 2004. As of 2009, semi-permanent GPS networks have been deployed every year at the Three Sisters, continually showing that inflation persists at South Sister.  Ecology  alt=Hemlock trees form a forest, but the underlying lava shows through bare in the lower left The ecology of the Three Sisters reflect their location in central Oregon's Cascade Range. The westside slopes from lie in the Western Cascade Montane Highlands ecoregion, where precipitation is abundant. Forests here consist predominantly of Douglas-fir and western hemlock, with minor components of mountain hemlock, noble fir, subalpine fir, grand fir, Pacific silver fir, red alder, and Pacific yew. Vine maples, rhododendron, Oregon grape, huckleberry, and thimbleberry grow beneath the trees. Douglas-fir is dominant below , while western hemlock dominates above. Timberline at the Three Sisters occurs at , where the forest canopy opens and the subalpine zone begins. These forests lie in the Cascade Crest montane forest ecoregion. Mountain hemlock trees dominate the forest in this area, while meadows sustain sedges, dwarf willows, tufted hairgrass, lupine, red paintbrush, and Newberry knotweed. Tree line occurs at . The vegetation in this harsh alpine zone consists of herbaceous and shrubby subalpine meadows. This zone has a large winter snowpack, with low temperatures for much of the year. There are patches of mountain hemlock, subalpine fir, and whitebark pine near the treeline, as well as wet meadows supporting Brewer's sedge, Holm's sedge, black alpine sedge, tufted hairgrass, and alpine aster. Near the peaks of the Three Sisters, there are extensive areas of bare rock. The lower eastern slopes of the Three Sisters below lie in the Ponderosa Pine/Bitterbrush Woodland ecoregion. This ecoregion has less precipitation than the western slopes and has soil derived from Mazama Ash (ash erupted from Mount Mazama). Stream flow changes little throughout the year due to the region's volcanic hydrogeology. These slopes support nearly pure stands of ponderosa pine. Understory vegetation includes greenleaf manzanita and snowberry at higher elevations and antelope bitterbrush at lower elevations. Mountain alder, stream dogwood, willows, and sedges grow along streams. Local fauna includes birds such as blue and ruffed grouse, small mammals like pikas, chipmunks, and golden-mantled ground squirrels, and larger species like the Columbian black-tailed deer, mule deer, Roosevelt elk, and American black bear. Bobcats, cougars, coyotes, wolverines, martens, badgers, weasels, bald eagles, and several hawk species are many of the predators throughout the Three Sisters area.  Human history  The Three Sisters area was occupied by Amerindians since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the Northern Paiute to the east and Molala to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. alt=A stern-looking man in an suit in the style of the mid-18th century The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \\"a number of high mountains\\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow- covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Fr√©mont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys. In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke. In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister. In 1892, President Grover Cleveland decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891. Cascades Reserve was a strip of land from wide around the main crest of the Cascade Range, stretching from the Columbia River almost to the border with California. In 1905, administration of the Reserve was moved from the General Land Office to the United States Forest Service. The Reserve was renamed the Cascade National Forest in 1907. In 1908, the forest was split: the eastern half became the Deschutes National Forest, while the western half merged in 1934 to form the Willamette National Forest. alt=Two volcanoes rise above a landscape of mixed forest and lava, with a glacier spanning the area between the two peaks Most of the Three Sisters glaciers were described for the first time by Ira A. Williams in 1916. Collier Glacier, between North and Middle Sister, was first studied and mapped by Edwin Hodge. Ruth Hopsen Keen took a forty-year photographic record of Collier Glacier, documenting part of the retreat of the glacier from 1910 to 1994. In the 1930s, the Three Sisters were part of a proposed National Monument. To maintain its authority over the region, the Forest Service decided to create a primitive area in 1937. The following year, at the instigation of Forest Service employee Bob Marshall, it was expanded by in the French Pete Creek basin. In 1957, the Forest Service decided to reclassify the area as a wilderness area and removed the old-growth forest of the French Pete Creek basin, despite protests of local environmental activists. The area became part of the National Wilderness Preservation System when the Wilderness Act of 1964 was passed, but the area still excluded the French Pete Creek basin. Responding to environmental mobilization throughout the state of Oregon, Congress passed the Endangered American Wilderness Act of 1978, which led to the reinstatement of French Pete Creek and its surroundings in the Three Sisters Wilderness Area. The Oregon Wilderness Act of 1984 further expanded the wilderness with the addition of around Erma Bell Lakes.  Recreation  alt=Two hikers with backpacks walk along a trail in the Three Sisters Wilderness, surrounded by trees with the Three Sisters visible in the background. The Three Sisters are a popular climbing destination for hikers and mountaineers. Due to extensive erosion and rockfall, North Sister is the most dangerous climb of the three peaks, and is often informally called the \\"Beast of the Cascades\\". One of its peaks, Little Brother, can be safely scrambled. The first recorded ascent of North Sister was made in 1857 by six people, including Oregon politicians George Lemuel Woods and James McBride, according to a story published in Overland Monthly in 1870. Today, the common trail covers round-trip, gaining in elevation. Middle Sister can also be scrambled, for a round-trip of and an elevation gain of . South Sister is the easiest of the three to climb, and has a trail all the way to summit. The standard route up the south ridge runs for round-trip, rising from at the trailhead to at its summit. It is a popular climb during August and September, with up to 400 people each day.

He succeeded Nechtan mac Der- Ilei when the latter abdicated and entered a monastery in 724. Neither the Annals of Ulster, nor the Annals of Tigernach, name Drest's father. The earlier versions of the Pictish Chronicle king lists simply name \\"Drest and Elpin\\" as kings after Nechtan. However, a late version, which includes Nechtan's second reign in 728-729, makes Drest's father one Talorgan. This version includes the otherwise unknown Carnach son of Ferach and √ìengus son of Bridei, and is generally not such as would inspire great confidence. Since Nechtan abdicated in favour of Drest, some kinship between them seems probable. A number of Nechtan's sons are reported to have died, so that Drest, whether a nephew, a son-in-law or cousin may have been Nechtan's nearest male kin. It may be that Drest was the son of the Talorg son of Drostan, \\"brother of Nechtan\\"  a half-brother or, perhaps a foster-brother  who had been imprisoned in 713. Whatever his descent, Drest's rule appears to have been quickly challenged. In 725, Simul son of Drest was imprisoned, but by whom is unknown. In 726 Nechtan was imprisoned by Drest, following which Alp√≠n, the Elpin of the king lists, deposed Drest. By 728 it appears that Drest, Nechtan, Alp√≠n and √ìengus mac Fergusa were engaged in a war for the Pictish throne. Drest was killed in battle against √ìengus at Dromo Dergg Blathuug (possibly Drumderg, near Blairgowrie) in 729. Whether there is any relationship between this Drest and the Talorgan son of Drest, king of Atholl, who was killed by drowning in 739, can only be speculation.

In 1983 he became the first Scandinavian rider to win a classic race when he was victorious in Paris‚ÄìBrussels, his other career highlights include winning Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico and the Tour de Romandie as well as twice finishing runner up in the Giro d'Italia in 1981 and 1982. Biography Prim rode for the local CK Wano cycling club in Varberg as a youngster and became Swedish Junior champion in 1972, as an amateur he was Swedish champion in 1976 and 1979 as well the Scandinavian amateur champion in 1975 and 1976. He took the under 22 classification of the Tour of Britain in 1976, in what was his first trip abroad with the Swedish national team. He competed in the team time trial event at the 1976 Summer Olympics. In 1978 and 1979 Prim turned in top class performances in the highly rated Italian stage race Settimana Bergamasca, which has been won by some of the Worlds top riders before they turned professional. Prim's feats in the Bergamasca race caught the eye of the top professional teams and at the end of 1979 Prim turned professional with the Italian Bianchi-Piaggio squad, a decision which was made easier by the presence of fellow Scandinavians Knut Knudsen and Alf Segers√§ll in that team. His team manager would be master tactician Giancarlo Ferretti. Prim's made an immediate impact as a professional in his debut season of 1980, he finished seventh in the early season Tour of Sardinia and was part of the Bianchi team that won the team time trial stage at Paris‚ÄìNice, this good form ensured him a ride in the Giro d'Italia where he took a stage into Teramo as well as finishing fourth overall and taking the young riders jersey. He was also disqualified after winning the stage into Sorrento when he rode Italian sprinter Giovanni Mantovani into the barriers. Later that season he won the Italian one day race the Coppa Agostoni. Prim went to the 1981 Giro d'Italia in top form after winning the Tour de Romandie just prior to the Italian race, he ended up taking the runners up spot behind Giovanni Battaglin, many observers felt that Prim could have won the 1981 Giro if his Bianchi squad had backed him solely instead of having three team leaders (Italians Silvano Contini and Giambattista Baronchelli were the others). In 1982 Prim finished runner up once again in the Giro, beaten by the tactically astute Bernard Hinault. In 1983 he entered the Giro as sole team leader for Bianchi and everything started well when he took the leaders pink jersey after the first stage team time trial, however, his form in the mountains was uncharacteristically poor and he eventually finished a disappointing 15th overall. In September 1983 he won the Paris‚ÄìBrussels, which at that time was still regarded as a \\"Classic\\" race, he went clear with an early break which stayed away for 280 kilometres, he dropped his breakaway companions on the Alsemberg climb just before the finish and remained clear until the finish to become the first Scandinavian rider to win a classic race. 1984 promised great things when Prim won the Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico stage race in Italy but his season was ruined when he crashed a few days before the Giro. 1985 saw the team renamed as Sammontana-Bianchi, with a new manager Wladimiro Bortolozzi, Moreno Argentin was brought in to be joint team leader with Tommy. Prim finished that year's Giro in fourth place behind three of the cycling world superstars, Bernard Hinault, Francesco Moser and Greg LeMond. 1986 saw Prim ride a disappointing Giro d'Italia when he finished 21st overall, this prompted his team to say they would not ride the Tour of Sweden which they had always done since its reintroduction in 1982. Tommy's reaction to this was to announce his retirement from cycling midway through the 1986 season at the young age of 31, he was feeling tired and felt he could no longer give it 100%. After his retirement from cycle racing, Tommy opened a bike shop back in his native Sweden, he then moved to other employment working for a mail order firm, a saw mill and then a salmon smokery. In 2000, Tommy was offered the chance to become team manager at the small UCI registered Team Crescent, a Swedish pro squad which was to promote Swedish under 23 riders. He has had some success in bringing through talented riders as the team evolved from Team Crescent to Bianchi Scandinavia to Bianchi Nordic. The team folded at the end of the 2004 season.

It was released as the B-side to the \\"Strange Brew\\" single in June 1967. In November, the song was included on Cream's second album, Disraeli Gears. The song features one of the earliest uses of a wah-wah pedal, which guitarist Eric Clapton plays throughout the song. Background The song was the first collaboration between guitarist Eric Clapton and artist Martin Sharp. Clapton composed the music, inspired by the Lovin' Spoonful's 1966 hit \\"Summer in the City\\". \\"I just started chatting to Eric\\", said Sharp, who lived in the same building. \\"I told him I had written a poem. He, in turn, told me he'd written some music. So I gave him my poem.

AllMusic's Matthew Greenwald calls it, \\"One of a few overtly psychedelic songs to have aged gracefully ... Lyrically, it's a relatively factual and colorful rendering of the great Greek tragedy Ulysses\\". In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton recalls: The song uses a \\"C/B flat/F chord pattern\\", which Greenwald describes as \\"simple but effective\\". Jack Bruce, on bass, also provides the vocal, and Ginger Baker is on drums. Cream recorded the song at Atlantic Studios in New York City in May 1967, during the sessions for Disraeli Gears. Atlantic brought in engineer Tom Dowd and producer Felix Pappalardi to work with Cream on their next album. For the recording, Clapton used a wah-wah pedal guitar effects unit for the first time. Cream performed the song in concert and a 10 March 1968 recording from Winterland in San Francisco is included on Live Cream Volume II. In May 1968, the group were filmed performing it for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour television programme. \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" was later overshadowed by \\"White Room\\", which utilised the chord progression and wah-wah to create one of Cream's biggest hits.

There have been a wide variety of ways in which thinkers have conceived of the relationship between Christianity and politics, with many arguing that Christianity directly supports a particular political ideology or philosophy. Along these lines, various thinkers have argued for Christian communism, Christian socialism, Christian anarchism, Christian libertarianism, or Christian democracy. Others believe that Christians should have little interest or participation in politics or government.  Foundations  The Hebrew Bible contains a complex chronicle of the Kings of Israel and Judah, written over the course of many generations by authors whose relationships and intimacy with the rulers of the several kingdoms fluctuated widely in both intimacy and respect. Some historical passages of the Hebrew Bible contain intimate portrayals of the inner workings of the royal households of Saul, David and Solomon. The accounts of subsequent monarchs are frequently more distanced and less detailed and frequently begin with the judgment that the monarch \\"did evil in the sight of the Lord\\". The Christian New Testament instead begins with the story of Jesus, crucified as a criminal who had offended both the Jewish priesthood and the Roman imperial authorities. At least to outward appearances, Jesus was at the periphery of political life and power in the Roman province of Judea. Early Christians were described by Celsus as those who refused military service and would not accept public office, nor assume any responsibility for the governing of cities. Origen confirms this description and adds that Christians do more for the good of the empire by forming an \\"army of piety\\" that prays for the well-being of the emperor and the safety of the empire. It has been argued that Christianity made a significant positive contribution to the development of modern democracy.Polygyny and democracy: a cross-cultural comparison. Cross-Cultural Research, 34/2 (2000), 190-208.Korotayev, A. (2003). Christianity and democracy: A cross-cultural study (afterthoughts). World Cultures, 13(2), 195-212.Unilineal descent organization and deep Christianization: A cross- cultural comparison. Cross-Cultural Research, 37/1 (2003), 133-157. = Right- wing = The Christian right within evangelical Christianity has formed many of its political views on social issues such as abortion, homosexuality and public education from passages in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.  Romans 13  In the Epistle to the Romans, chapter 13:1-7, Paul instructs Roman Christians to submit to government. See also 1 Peter 2:13-17 and Titus 3:1 for parallels. Mainstream theologians and the Christian right have interpreted Romans 13:1‚Äì7 to mean Christians should support the state and wield the sword when necessary, as God has instituted the idea of governments to be his main tool to preserve social order. = Left-wing = The first Jewish Christian communities, as described in the Acts of the Apostles, were organized along a principle of communal ownership of goods. The Christian left have interpreted these and other passages to mean that an ideal society would be based on Christian socialism or Christian communism. There are other intentional christian communities that, inspired by the first christian church as described in Acts 2 and 4, share all their possessions in an effort to put into action Christ's command to love God and neighbour. The Simple Way, the Bruderhof communities, and the Hutterites are all inspired, to some degree, by the model of church community described in Acts. = Libertarianism = An emerging tradition of political thought, Christian libertarians maintain that state intervention to promote piety or generosity can be unethical and counterproductive. Coercion by threat of violence robs otherwise moral acts of their virtue, inspires resentment and disrespect even for just laws on the part of the coerced, and has a spiritually deleterious effect upon the coercers. As John Chrysostom, late 4th-century Church Father and Archbishop of Constantinople, writes in his work On the Priesthood (Book II, Section 3), > For Christians above all men are not permitted forcibly to correct the > failings of those who sin. Secular judges indeed, when they have captured > malefactors under the law, show their authority to be great, and prevent > them even against their will from following their own devices: but in our > case the wrong-doer must be made better, not by force, but by persuasion. > For neither has authority of this kind for the restraint of sinners been > given us by law, nor, if it had been given, should we have any field for the > exercise of our power, inasmuch as God rewards those who abstain from evil > by their own choice, not of necessity. Consequently much skill is required > that our patients may be induced to submit willingly to the treatment > prescribed by the physicians, and not only this, but that they may be > grateful also for the cure. For if any one when he is bound becomes restive > (which it is in his power to be), he makes the mischief worse; and if he > should pay no heed to the words which cut like steel, he inflicts another > wound by means of this contempt, and the intention to heal only becomes the > occasion of a worse disorder. For it is not possible for any one to cure a > man by compulsion against his will. While Christian libertarians disagree over whether and to what extent agents of the state possess the moral authority to intervene in the lives of citizens, government involvement is generally viewed with skepticism and suspicion. As with the Christian left, war and nation-building are common targets of ethical scrutiny from Christians espousing the libertarian philosophy. The governing maxim for many natural-rights libertarians, including those of faith, is the non-aggression principle, which forbids the initiation of force but does not preclude the restrained, proportional use of defensive or disciplinary violence against the initiator. It has been compared to the Golden Rule and its converse, the Silver Rule. Christian libertarians often defend the institution of private property by pointing to the many Biblical injunctions against theft, to the voluntary nature of faith and the sharing of goods in early Christian communities, and to the fact that Jesus never advocated the redistribution of income and wealth by political means. According to Christian libertarianism, to seize the life, liberty, or legitimately acquired property of an individual by coercion, even for that person's well-being or for the benefit of others, constitutes a violation of his or her human dignity as an image-bearer of God. Thus, most forms of taxation and all laws that prevent or distort free and nonviolent exchange are unacceptable. The classical doctrine of original or ancestral sin furthermore suggests to Christian libertarians that political (and for some left- libertarians, economic) power ought to be democratically distributed and decentralized to guard against government oppression and the natural human tendency to corruption. In opposition to centralized political authority, Christian libertarians frequently cite the eighth chapter of the Biblical book of 1 Samuel (1 Kings LXX), in which God tells the prophet Samuel that the children of Israel have rejected Him by demanding a king to reign over them, and He describes the many ways such a king will oppress the people. While one of the Church's societal roles may be to promote righteousness in service and humble obedience to God, equal liberty is the highest or only political value. The state's raison d'√™tre is to prevent rights violations, to quarantine or punish justly, and ideally to restore offenders so they can again peaceably dwell and participate in civil society. = Anarchism =  Sermon on the Mount  More than any other Bible source, the Sermon on the Mount is used as the basis for Christian anarchism. The foundation of Christian anarchism is a rejection of violence, with Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You regarded as a key text. Tolstoy takes the viewpoint that all governments who wage war, and churches who in turn support those governments, are an affront to the Christian principles of nonviolence and nonresistance. Christians have interpreted Romans 13:1‚Äì7 to mean they should support the state and wield the sword when requested, as God has sanctified the state to be his main tool to preserve social order. Christian anarchists do not share this interpretation of Romans 13 but given Paul's declaration to submit to authorities they do not attempt to overthrow the state. However anarchists still describe the state as an evil power executing wrath and vengeance. As wrath and vengeance are opposite to the Christian values of returning good for evil, Christian anarchists neither support, nor participate in, the state.  Book of Revelation  Christian eschatology and various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques Ellul, have identified the State and political power as the Beast in the Book of Revelation. Apocalyptic texts frequently coach radical criticism of existing regimes under the form of allegory; this, at least, is a frequently mentioned interpretation of the Book of Daniel, frequently interpreted by secular scholars as a second-century diatribe against Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who persecuted the Jews and provoked the revolt of the Maccabees. The Book of Revelation contains even more vehement imagery, which many secular scholars believe was directed against the Roman empire. The empire, or the city of Rome itself, are identified by these scholars as the Whore of Babylon, and the Roman emperor becomes the Beast or Antichrist. Both divine punishment and economic and military catastrophe are prophesied against \\"Babylon\\", which most scholars agree is John's code name for Rome. No call to arms is contained within the Christian apocalypse. Instead, the calamities that doom the oppressive regime represented by these allegorical figures are expected from divine intervention alone. Nevertheless, if the books are properly read in this way, they seem to evidence deep hostility to the Roman government, no doubt a reaction to the persecution of Christians by the Roman state. = Anabaptism = Anabaptism adheres to a two kingdom concept. This is the belief that the kingdom of heaven or of Christ (the Church) is different and distinct from the kingdoms of this world. It essentially means the separation of church and state but differs from Protestantism in their belief that the church has no right to interfere in the affairs of the state any more than the state in the church. This viewpoint is still held by the most religiously conservative Anabaptism groups, such as the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, Conservative Mennonites, and Old Order River Brethren. Not all Anabaptist churches subscribe to anarchist ideologies. The Hutterite church traces its roots back to the Radical Reformation and Jacoub Hutter, but respect and adhere to government authority. The Bruderhof, another church community in the Anabaptist tradition, respects the god-given authority of the state, while acknowledging that their ultimate allegiance is to God.  The Christian empire  When the Roman persecution of Christianity came to an end under Constantine I with the Edict of Milan, and the Nicene Christian faith became the favoured religion of the Roman Empire, Christians were presented with issues they never before had to confront. Could a Christian ruler legitimately wage war? If Christians were discouraged in Scripture from entering litigation against one another, how were they supposed to function as officers within a judicial system? What civil rights were to be afforded to non-Christians or to heterodox Christians in a civil commonwealth governed by the orthodox faithful? Augustine of Hippo was one religious figure who confronted these issues in The City of God; in this work, he sought to defend Christians against pagan charges that the abandonment of official sponsorship of pagan worship had brought civil and military calamities upon the Roman Empire by the abandoned pagan deities. (Pecknold, 2010) Augustine sought to reaffirm that the City of God was a heavenly and spiritual matter, as opposed to an earthly and political affair. The City of God is contrasted with, and in conflict with, the city of men; but the City of God's eventual triumph is assured by divine prophecy. = Catholics, war and peace = Catholics historically have had a wide variety of positions on issues of war and peace. The historical peace churches are now the chief exponents of Christian pacifism, but this was an issue that first came to light during the Roman Empire. Soldiers in the Roman military who converted to Roman Catholicism were among the first who had to face these issues. Catholics in the Roman military had to confront a number of issues, that go beyond the obvious one about whether war could be reconciled with the Christian religion. Paganism saturated Roman military institutions. Idols of the Greco-Roman gods appeared on the legionary standards. Military service involved oaths of loyalty that maight contradict Catholic teachings even if they did not invoke pagan gods. The duties of Roman military personnel included law enforcement as well as defense, and as such Roman soldiers were sometimes obliged to participate in the persecution of Christians themselves. Sexual licentiousness was considered to be a moral hazard to which military personnel were exposed. See Imperial cult (ancient Rome). The conversion of Constantine I transformed the relationship of the Christian churches with the Roman military even as it transformed the relationship of the churches with the Roman state. A strongly contrary idea, sometimes called \\"caesaropapism\\", identified the now Catholic Empire with the Church militant. The Latin word Christianitas originally meant the body of all Christians conceived as a political body, or the territory of the globe occupied by Christians, something akin to the English word Christendom. Apocalyptic texts were reinterpreted. The idea of a Christian empire continued to play a powerful role in Western Europe even after the collapse of Roman rule there; the name of the Holy Roman Empire bears witness to its claims to sanctity as well as to universal rule. An apocryphal apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius, written during the seventh century, depicts a saintly Last Roman Emperor who holds his earthly kingdom in anticipation of Christ's return. According to Pseudo-Methodius, the Last Emperor will wage war in the last days against God's enemies, including Gog and Magog and the Antichrist. Early Middle Ages The Western Roman Empire faded out of existence in the late 5th century; Charlemagne arguably revived it in the form of the Holy Roman Empire from 800. Both popes and emperors recognized that church and state worked together de facto in ruling medieval Europe. Secular rulers would support missionary efforts in order to enlarge their realms. Bishops and abbots were not only church leaders, but often also large land- owning princes and thus vassals of secular feudal lords. The line dividing church and state interests was not always clear.Jantzen, Katy. \\"Christianity and Politics, Past and Present\\", C2C Journal, June 19, 2009 In Western Europe, after the collapse of Roman rule, yet more issues arose. Sensing war as an aspect of politics, the Catholic Church expressed periodic unease with the fact that, in the absence of central imperial rule, Christian princes made war against each other. Church councils attempted to limit the volume and permitted times of warfare from 989 onwards by proclaiming the Truce of God, which sought to set limits upon the times and places where warfare could be conducted, and to protect Christian non-combatants from the hazards of war. The Crusades involved - at least in theory - a declaration of war by the entire armed body of Christendom against an enemy that was implicitly labelled an enemy of God and His Church. Some Crusades aimed to recover and secure Jerusalem and the Holy Land from the Muslims (1095-1291); other Crusades attacked the Cathari (1209-1229), and the Teutonic Knights and their supporters fought against non-Catholics (including Eastern Orthodox Christians) in the Baltic Sea area (1147-1410). In Spain, the Crusader mindset continued for several centuries after the last crusade in the Middle East, in the form of the Reconquista, a series of wars (711-1492) fought to recover the Iberian peninsula from the Muslim Moors. These latter wars were local affairs, and the participation of the entire armed body of Catholics - let alone Orthodox Christianity - was only theoretical.

It was an Oprah's Book Club selection in 2000. Plot summary Throughout the 20 years of her marriage, Samantha Morrow has been content with her life, though she knows it isn't perfect. She has a nice home, a great son, and a husband she loves. But everything is turned upside down when her husband, David, tells her he wants out of their marriage. His rapid departure on the heels of this announcement leaves Sam horribly shocked, utterly confused, and oddly obsessed with Martha Stewart. Her initial reaction is to go on a spending spree, charging thousands of dollars worth of merchandise at Tiffany's to her husband's credit card. But when reality sets in and her husband cuts her off, she realizes that if she wants to keep the house she loves and make a home for herself and her son, she's going to have to generate some income. Her first solution to this dilemma is to find a couple of roommates. Between the finished portion of the basement and the extra bedroom upstairs, Sam figures she can take on two boarders and mitigate a large portion of the mortgage payment. She finds her first boarder quickly‚Äîthe septuagenarian mother of an acquaintance‚Äîand is delighted. Lydia Fitch is quiet, clean, concerned, friendly, and more than eager to play grandmother to Sam's son, Travis. Which is just as well, since Sam's own mother doesn't quite fit the bill. In fact, Sam's mother has made a career out of dating since the death of her husband two decades ago and is now determined to fix Sam up as soon as possible‚Äîa plan with foreseeable disasters written all over it. Sam's life is further complicated when she starts looking for a job, for other than a gig singing in a band years ago, she's never been employed. But then King, the gentle giant of a man who helps Lydia move in, puts Sam in touch with the employment agency he works for. Suddenly Sam is off on a variety of short-term jobs, everything from making change at a Laundromat, to working as a carpenter's helper. When she gets the devastating news that Lydia has decided to marry her longtime beau and move out, Sam takes on a second boarder for the basement space: a sullen, depressed college student.

The game was also released for the Amiga and Amiga CD32 platforms, the Super NES and the Game Gear. Operation Starfish is the third and last game in the James Pond series. It is also the only one that was only released for AGA Amigas: the Amiga 1200, the Amiga 4000 and CD32. The game's working title was James Pond 3: Splash Gordon, a play on Flash Gordon. Although it enjoyed good sales, it was not as well received as other games in the series. Plot Following his defeat in Robocod, the evil Dr. Maybe learns of the high quality cheese that lies on the moon. Hiring a workforce of rats, Dr. Maybe begins mining the moon for cheese so he can conquer the global markets and fund his operations. In order to stop Dr. Maybe, James Pond, along with his new sidekick, Finnius Frog, journey to the moon in order to put a stop to Dr. Maybe's mining operations. Gameplay In-game screenshot (Amiga) The gameplay in Operation Starfish is similar to Super Mario World. The map of the Moon consists of many levels connected with pathways. The levels are grouped into themed sections including cheese, custard, ice cream and more, with each section culminating in a boss fight. Many stage names are a play on words, such as \\"The Garden of Edam\\" for the first level (named after the Garden of Eden). A unique twist to the standard \\"Super Mario\\"-style gameplay is that Pond's magno-boots allow him to run up walls. Once on a ceiling, Pond will only fall down if he jumps off, and some levels have sections which the player must navigate in this upside-down fashion. Although Pond can no longer stretch his body upwards as he could in the preceding game, many levels give the player gadgets that allow Pond to travel a great distance upwards. Pond can run, jump and punch as standard. He can also use a wide array of items that he encounters, such as spring shoes, fruit guns and dynamite. By finding a special icon, players can play as his partner, Finnius the frog, as long as he has been rescued in a certain level. A cheat code allows the player to play as Finnius in all levels. Finnius can bounce repeatedly on his belly to jump increasingly high in the air, but cannot use any gadgets except for chattering teeth. The goal of each level is to find one of its communication beacons and break it. Some levels have beacons that will not activate until four colored teacups are found and collected by the player. Many levels have a hidden pickup that will reveal a secret route once the level is completed, in a similar fashion to the secret exits in Super Mario World. Finding at least some of the secret levels is essential to finishing the game successfully. The player is informed that they need to destroy all of Dr Maybe's Cheese Mines, but this will not give the full ending once the final level is beaten. Certain levels contain \\"Stiltonium\\" extractors that Dr Maybe is using to produce a superweapon - these need to be destroyed in addition to the cheese mines to in order to finish the game completely. Gadgets *Dynamite: Dynamite ignites immediately upon being picked up. After the fuse has burned down, the resulting explosion will destroy certain blocks or TNT boxes. It will also kill any enemy or damage the player. *Bomb: Similar to dynamite, but the fuse will only start to burn once the bomb is thrown. *Fruit Gun: While fruit can be picked up and thrown at enemies, revealing fruit from a block while Pond has the fruit gun allows it to be loaded as upgraded ammunition. Different foods produce different results. For example, a cupcake acts as a homing missile. *Fruit Suit: Fruit Suits will protect the player from 2 or more enemy attacks. They also provide the ability to walk through hot liquids such as custard without taking damage. *X-ray specs: Causes hidden blocks to appear as translucent blocks. *Spring Shoes: When wearing these, Pond can repeatedly bounce to achieve incrementally higher heights. *Television: Once broken, the television releases a small ghost, which attempts to get back into the TV set. By holding the broken television, the player can bounce repeatedly on the ghost as it tries to get back inside. *Jetpack: A device with a rocket thruster that can propel Pond into the air. Fuel cans will refill the jetpack's fuel reserve. The jetpack is also equipped with a powerful yogurt cannon. *Finnius: Once rescued from a certain level, Finnius can be played by finding an icon with his face on. Hitting the icon again will revert the player's control to Pond.  Unreleased ports  A Master System version of this game was planned at one stage, but was cancelled for unknown reasons. An Atari Jaguar version was being developed by Millennium Interactive and planned to be published by Telegames but it never released due to the disappearance of the sub-contracted programmer of the port and its associated code after development began.

It was made immediately after bandleader Mark E. Smith divorced guitarist Brix Smith. Brix's departure helped define the sound of this album: her background vocals and relatively pop-oriented guitar, which had become mainstays of The Fall, are noticeably absent in this release. In one of the more unusual events in the group's career, she was replaced by founding former member Martin Bramah, who had previously left the group in 1979 to form his own group Blue Orchids. Lead-off single \\"Telephone Thing\\" could have been seen as a nod to the Manchester scene of the time as the sound is quite similar to the dance- influenced music that was being released by Happy Mondays and The Stone Roses in 1989. However, its origins were in Smith's previous collaboration with Coldcut on their track \\"I'm in Deep\\", which, in turn, led to Coldcut producing the track and \\"Black Monk Theme Part II\\", one of two tracks by 60s garage band The Monks to be covered on the album (the other being \\"Black Monk Theme\\" ‚Äì The Fall retitled both tracks). Elsewhere, Bramah, appearing on his first Fall album since Live at the Witch Trials adds a distinctly raw, even rockabilly sound to some of the songs. However, the album's best-known track was one of the least typical of the group's catalogue: \\"Bill Is Dead\\", a slow-paced tender love song which topped John Peel's Festive Fifty that year, the only occasion in the DJ's lifetime when his favourite band would do so. Although originally conceived by Smith and Craig Scanlon as a parody of The Smiths, Smith changed lyrical tack when he decided Scanlon's music deserved better, delivering a highly personal lyric. However, at Smith's insistence, it was not released as a single.Simon Ford, Hip Priest, Quartet 2003 pp 200‚Äì201 The critical reception to Extricate was largely positive, with Melody Maker suggesting that it was \\"possibly their finest yet\\" and NME giving the album a full 10/10.

The mansion that he built in Montreal's Golden Square Mile has been renamed Purvis Hall and is today owned by McGill University. Business career Born in Montreal, Quebec, to Samuel Davis and Minnie Falk Davis, he graduated from the High School of Montreal and then joined his elder brothers Eugene Harmon and Maurice Edward in the family's cigar business, S. Davis and Sons. In 1888, S. Davis and Sons purchased another Montreal firm, D. Ritchie and Company. In 1895, the American Tobacco Company purchased D. Ritchie and Company, as well as the American Cigarette Company, another Montreal cigarette manufacturer. Samuel Davis retired from S. Davis and Sons, and Mortimer Davis left the family firm, which remained in the hands of two of his brothers, to become president of the American Tobacco Company of Canada. In 1902, the British-American Tobacco Company Limited was formed by the merger of the American Tobacco Company and the Imperial Tobacco Company of England. It later purchased the American Tobacco Company of Canada, which became the Imperial Tobacco Company of Canada Ltd., and Mortimer Davis was its first president. The financial power of the empire over which he presided earned him the title of \\"Tobacco King,\\" which he shares with his great rival, Sir William Christopher Macdonald. Sir Mortimer Barnett Davis from Canadian men of affairs in cartoon (1922) In 1917, he was knighted by King George V, becoming the first Canadian-born Jew to receive such an honour. Davis was a director of many companies, including the Union Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Henry Corby distillery (he served as president from 1907 to 1922), Crown Trust Company, Empire Tobacco, and part of the senior management of the Nova Scotia Silver Cobalt Mining Company and the Consolidated Asbestos Mining Company. In addition, he was a member of the Montreal Board of Trade and the Montreal Stock Exchange. Personal life On June 12, 1898, in San Francisco, Davis married Henriette Marie Meyer, daughter of Charles Meyer, a banker and philanthropist. Their only son, Mortimer Davis, junior, died in 1940. (page 4) Davis was a member of Temple Emanu-El (see Temple Emanu-El-Beth Sholom (Westmount, Quebec)), which his father had helped to establish. He underwrote the entire $420,000 of a new YMHA (see Federation CJA) building, which opened at Mount Royal, near Park Avenue, shortly after his death. He was a key force in building the Mount Sinai Sanatarium, in Pr√©fontaine. In 1924, Davis divorced his wife in order to marry Eleanor Curran (d. 1963). He spent many of the final years of his life at Les Gla√Øeuls, his villa in Cannes, where he died in 1928. He is interred within Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. His former residence in the Golden Square Mile (formerly called Sir Mortimer B. Davis House) is now known as Purvis Hall, on the grounds of McGill University. Davis left 75% of his estate to be used for the construction of a Jewish public hospital in Montreal that would bear his name. However, he stipulated that the funds be invested for 50 years to allow them to reach a sum capable of funding a sizable hospital. And so it was that in 1978, $10 million from his estate was donated to the existing Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, which was renamed the Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital. His first wife was an active philanthropist and was made an officer of the L√©gion d'honneur and Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She died in 1963. The Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, the Lady Davis Fellowship, the Lady Davis Mechanical & Aeronautical Engineering Center (a 7-storey low-rise building of the Technion in Haifa), the Lady Davis Building (the main building of the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem) and the Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, Israel are named in her honour.

Such an orbital has one or more nodes in the bonding region between the nuclei. The density of the electrons in the orbital is concentrated outside the bonding region and acts to pull one nucleus away from the other and tends to cause mutual repulsion between the two atoms.Atkins P. and de Paula J. Atkins Physical Chemistry. 8th ed. (W.H. Freeman 2006), p.371 Miessler G.L. and Tarr D.A., Inorganic Chemistry 2nd ed. (Prentice-Hall 1999), p.111 This is in contrast to a bonding molecular orbital, which has a lower energy than that of the separate atoms, and is responsible for chemical bonds. Diatomic molecules Antibonding molecular orbitals (MOs) are normally higher in energy than bonding molecular orbitals. Bonding and antibonding orbitals form when atoms combine into molecules. If two hydrogen atoms are initially far apart, they have identical atomic orbitals. However, as the spacing between the two atoms becomes smaller, the electron wave functions begin to overlap. The Pauli exclusion principle prohibits any two electrons (e-) in a molecule from having the same set of quantum numbers. Therefore each original atomic orbital of the isolated atoms (for example, the ground state energy level, 1s) splits into two molecular orbitals belonging to the pair, one lower in energy than the original atomic level and one higher. The orbital which is in a lower energy state than the orbitals of the separate atoms is the bonding orbital, which is more stable and promotes the bonding of the two H atoms into H2. The higher-energy orbital is the antibonding orbital, which is less stable and opposes bonding if it is occupied. In a molecule such as H2, the two electrons normally occupy the lower-energy bonding orbital, so that the molecule is more stable than the separate H atoms. He2 electron configuration. The four electrons occupy one bonding orbital at lower energy, and one antibonding orbital at higher energy than the atomic orbitals. A molecular orbital becomes antibonding when there is less electron density between the two nuclei than there would be if there were no bonding interaction at all. When a molecular orbital changes sign (from positive to negative) at a nodal plane between two atoms, it is said to be antibonding with respect to those atoms. Antibonding orbitals are often labelled with an asterisk (*) on molecular orbital diagrams. In homonuclear diatomic molecules, œÉ* (sigma star) antibonding orbitals have no nodal planes passing through the two nuclei, like sigma bonds, and œÄ* (pi star) orbitals have one nodal plane passing through the two nuclei, like pi bonds. The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that no two electrons in an interacting system may have the same quantum state. If the bonding orbitals are filled, then any additional electrons will occupy antibonding orbitals. This occurs in the He2 molecule, in which both the 1sœÉ and 1sœÉ* orbitals are filled. Since the antibonding orbital is more antibonding than the bonding orbital is bonding, the molecule has a higher energy than two separated helium atoms, and it is therefore unstable. Polyatomic molecules Butadiene pi molecular orbitals. The two colors show opposite signs of the wavefunction. In molecules with several atoms, some orbitals may be delocalized over more than two atoms. A particular molecular orbital may be bonding with respect to some adjacent pairs of atoms and antibonding with respect to other pairs. If the bonding interactions outnumber the antibonding interactions, the MO is said to be bonding, whereas, if the antibonding interactions outnumber the bonding interactions, the molecular orbital is said to be antibonding. For example, butadiene has pi orbitals which are delocalized over all four carbon atoms. There are two bonding pi orbitals which are occupied in the ground state: œÄ1 is bonding between all carbons, while œÄ2 is bonding between C1 and C2 and between C3 and C4, and antibonding between C2 and C3. There are also antibonding pi orbitals with two and three antibonding interactions as shown in the diagram; these are vacant in the ground state, but may be occupied in excited states. Similarly benzene with six carbon atoms has three bonding pi orbitals and three antibonding pi orbitals. Since each carbon atom contributes one electron to the œÄ-system of benzene, there are six pi electrons which fill the three lowest-energy pi molecular orbitals (the bonding pi orbitals). Antibonding orbitals are also important for explaining chemical reactions in terms of molecular orbital theory. Roald Hoffmann and Kenichi Fukui shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work and further development of qualitative molecular orbital explanations for chemical reactions.

Nadine was starved to death by her parents, Carla Lockwood and Leroy Dickerson, at Lockwood's apartment in Washington Heights, and were both convicted of second degree murder. Nadine's death was a significant contributing factor to the overhaul of the child protective services system in New York City. Murder Nadine Lockwood lived with her mother, Carla Lockwood, in an apartment in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, along with her six siblings. Lockwood was a drug addict and was known by child protective services, but no serious action had been brought against her. Nadine was systematically starved by her mother, who admitted to police that she had hated the little girl and specifically singled her out for abuse. Lockwood kept Nadine, whom she referred to as \\"it\\", in squalid conditions, locked in a room in a covered crib. When Nadine was found dead on August 31, 1996, less than a month before her fifth birthday, she was emaciated and weighed only 15 and a half pounds. Lockwood eventually pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. Nadine's father, Leroy Dickerson, lived separately and was frequently an absentee father. Two of Dickerson's other children with Lockwood, both in their early teens, testified against him in court stating that he had been equally complicit in the abuse of Nadine. They also stated that they were encouraged to not tell anyone about the abuse, and were instructed to say Nadine was visiting a relative in the South. Dickerson was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years to life for \\"depraved indifference\\" towards Nadine's life. Media coverage Nadine became known in New York-based tabloids such as the New York Daily News and The New York Post due to the circumstances surrounding her death. The press called her \\"the girl who was never loved\\" and followed the trials of both of her parents closely. Her story was also publicized because it greatly paralleled that of Elisa Izquierdo, who had been murdered by her mother nine months earlier; both girls had been singled out among their numerous siblings for abuse. Later, the case would also be compared to that of Nixzmary Brown, another child that was specifically targeted for abuse by a parent. As in the Izquierdo case, investigation into Nadine's death revealed that many potential opportunities to intervene had been missed. The family had been known to city agencies since 1989, when neglect proceedings were initiated because one of Carla Lockwood's other children tested positive for cocaine at birth. The matter was dropped when Lockwood entered a drug treatment program. Nadine herself had tested positive for cocaine at birth, but again, a case against Lockwood was dismissed within six months. Neighbors allegedly called the Child Welfare Administration several times in regards to the abuse Nadine suffered at her mother's hands, but little was done to investigate. The mishandling of Nadine's case was one of the factors that prompted a major overhaul of New York City's child protective services and protocols for investigating abuse allegations.

It was founded on 20 May 1636 by Grace, Lady Manners, who lived at Haddon Hall, the current home of Lord and Lady Edward Manners, and has also in the past been known as the Bakewell Grammar School. It is now a member of the Peak 11 group of secondary schools in the Peak District. History Lady Manners has a long history of providing education in the Peak District area. It began as a boys' school, but later changed to admit girls as well. It was a successful grammar school, but later changed to become a comprehensive school. =Beginnings= In May 1636 Grace, Lady Manners bought some land at Elton which was to provide an annual income of ¬£15 for \\"the mayntayninge of a Schoolemaister for ever to teach a free Schoole within the Townshippe of Bakewell, for the better instructinge of the male children of the Inhabitants of Bakewell and Great Rowsley aforesaid...\\" The schoolmaster would \\"be appointed by the Lords of the Manor of Haddon, in the said Countie of Derby, being the heires or posteritie of the said Grace, Ladie Manners...\\" and as with the Pursglove Grammar School in Tideswell, the deed stipulated that the schoolmaster was to remain unmarried, and \\"if the said Schoolemaister shall at any time afterward marry, or shall live disorderly or scandalously, that then the said Schoolemaister shall have noe benefitt by the said Annuitie or rente charge, but shall be displaced from the said Schoole\\". Additional to his annuity, the schoolmaster was permitted to take a registration fee of a shilling for each new boy. Additionally the schoolmaster would have received a pay rise following Grace's death as her 1649 will allowed for the all the monies generated by the land at Elton to be used for school use (during her life she had kept 25% of the income). The school is first referred to as a \\"Grammer Schoole\\" in her will. The original school day ran from 7 to 11 a.m. and 1 to 5 p.m. \\"except Sundays and holidays\\". =19th century= In 1806 the schoolmaster, Rev. M. Chapman handed over to the Rev. J. Browne who was appointed by the Duke of Rutland receiving an annual salary of ¬£50 and, for a while, the school became known as \\"Mr. Browne's\\". Up until now, the school had shared accommodation with the older Chantry School, South Church Street, Bakewell. In 1826, the school moved around the corner to The Old Town Hall, King Street. The Old Town Hall had been built in 1709 and, as well as being Town Hall, and Buttermarket, the upper floor had been used for Court and Quarter Sessions. In 1846 Rev. T. Hurst, a graduate of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and a curate at the Parish Church, took over as schoolmaster. According to White's Directory of Derbyshire (1857) ‚Äì Under Charities, White's Directory adds \\"Lady Manners, in 1637, left a rent charge of ¬£15 per annum, out of lands at Elton, to a schoolmaster, for the instruction of male children of the township of Bakewell and Great Rowsley. The master also receives a voluntary addition of ¬£40 from the Duke of Rutland, making in the whole, ¬£55 per annum; and according to the revised regulations and rules, 20 youths are admitted on the foundation, on the payment of 1s. for registration, and instructed in English generally, Latin, and Greek. at 5s. 3d. per quarter. Mr. Wm. Kay, L.C.P., the master, has good accommodation for boarders, at his own residence, Bridge street.\\" In 1862 the school was briefly annexed to Mr. William Kay's private Grammar and Commercial Academy in Bridge Street but remained in the King Street premises. A School Inquiry Report of 1866 states that the Foundation had become \\"a mere appendage and advertisement to an inferior commercial boarding school kept by the headmaster\\". At this time \\"there were then thirty-two boarders, fourteen dayboys not on the Foundation, and seven who were\\". When Mr. Kay died in 1874, Archdeacon Balston, then Vicar of Bakewell, and a former Headmaster of Eton, recommended that the school should be closed, and in the absence of a suitable successor the monies from Lady Manners' Foundation should be allowed to accumulate. The school closed in 1874, and remained closed for 22 years. Lady Manners School ceased to exist. =A new start= The Charity Commissioners decided that a new building could be built \\"to be used as a grammar school by day, earning through its examinations grants from the Science and Art Department, and as a centre for technical classes in the evenings\\". The new school backed onto Bath Gardens and was opened on 22 September 1896. The school now admitted girls as well as boys ‚Äì a pre-condition of the County Council's grant of ¬£600 towards the building costs. This was the first time an endowed School of this type had become co-educational. The school opened with fifty pupils on roll, all between the ages of eight and eighteen. The first Headmaster was Charles J. Mansford, B.A.(London). Subjects taught were Religious Knowledge, English, Classics, Mathematics, Science, French and Drawing. Boys did Woodwork, girls did Domestic Science. The Bakewell Show Ground was used for games. Fees were ¬£2 per head, but this meant the school operated at a loss and so the County Council agreed to fund 12 scholarships. The school was one of the first to establish a more modern curriculum. An article in Review of Reviews (1898) says \\"Within the school there is a School of Science, affiliated with South Kensington, about one half of the scholars being so classed. Girls are taught exactly the same science, for instance, as boys, and at the same time, in the same room. So far the science taught embraces Practical and Theoretical Chemistry, with Practical and Theoretical Physics\\".Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread in Review of Reviews, 17 (1898), 63‚Äì68 (accessed 16 November 2007) =The 20th century= In 1900 two boarding houses were set up, at Dagnall for boys, and in The Avenue for girls, and in 1909 the Old Bath House (now Haig House) was bought as extra premises for Fifth and Sixth Form, and Staff. In 1919 four acres of land who bought in Shutts Lane for use as a playing field. This remains part of the school playing field today. The Foundation Stone of new school buildings, on the present School site in Shutts Lane, was laid by the Duke of Rutland on 20 May 1936, on the 300th anniversary of the founding of the School by Grace, Lady Manners in 1636. The new buildings were opened on 24 February 1938. During World War II Lady Manners School shared their building with North Manchester High School for Boys who had been evacuated. On a two-week rotation, Lady Manners pupils went to school in the morning (including Saturday), and Manchester Grammar pupils in the afternoon. The following week, this was reversed. In the 1960s the school had around 550 boys and girls and was a voluntary controlled school. In 1972 Grace, Lady Manners Grammar School became a secondary comprehensive, admitting all pupils within its catchment for secondary education. By the late 1970s it had around 1300 boys and girls. The school became grant maintained in the early 1990s. Emblem and motto The Manners' Arms from above the south door of St. Mary's church Bloxholm. The school's peacock emblem is the crest above the arms of the Manners family.Manners arms and motto at geograph.org.uk (accessed 16 November 2007) The motto, 'Pour y parvenir', is also derived from the Manners family and its translations include \\"To attain\\", or \\"Strive to Attain\\". The house system The House system was created in 1912. At that time there were three Houses established called Town, North and South. The planning for this took place during 1911 and the reason for creating the Houses was to help develop Sport in school so that, with a competitive dimension, students would enthusiastically play for their Houses. They provided a chance for students to achieve success and enjoy friendly yet meaningful competition. So Sports Day on 21 June 1912, which was actually the Fourteenth Annual Sports Day, was the first time that the Houses competed against one another for the Wrench Shield. The first ever winners were Town House (the equivalent of the current Glossop House). After the First World War, in 1919, the Houses were renamed and an extra House was added. The principle of allocation to the Houses was still geographical. The Houses were then called Nesfield (the South area ‚Äì Matlock and beyond), Taylor (also South as far as Darley Dale), Glossop (the Bakewell 'Town' area) and Barker (the North). These names were those of Governors who had been especially important in the reopening of Lady Manners School in 1896. In 1924 a new school was opened in Matlock (Ernest Bailey School) so fewer students came from that area and Nesfield House disappeared. Barker House also disappeared for a while at the end of 1937 because when Buxton College became a County School and the Ridgefield boarding annex was no longer needed, there were fewer students from the North area. This was a weakness of the principle of allocating students to Houses on a geographical basis. To confuse the situation a little further, there was also a 'School House' (photographs of its twenty or so members still exist for the period 1931 to 1941) which was for 'boarders'. This House did not seem to compete for the Inter-House trophies in quite the same way as the main Houses, but did have their own activities, organised internally for pupils living in the School House. By 1938, coinciding with the effective occupation of the new school buildings on Shutts Lane, the main Houses were rearranged again, now numbering four: Elton, Haddon, Glossop and Taylor. In 1947, just after the Second World War, there was another change when the number of Houses became three again and Barker reappeared, replacing Haddon and Elton. Competition between the Houses was no longer just on the basis of sport, and other activities had become important too. By 1959 there were plans to create a fourth House again and this time the new House was to be named Cockerton. This naming was a tribute to the Cockerton family that had given over 50 years of service to the School, firstly with Mr VR Cockerton and then with his son Mr RWP Cockerton. Both had been School Governors and Mr VR Cockerton had been actively involved in the establishing of the current school site. So ever since the early 1960s there have been four Houses ‚Äì Barker, Cockerton, Glossop and Taylor ‚Äì just like now ‚Äì and students are no longer allocated to these Houses according to where they live, but according to which of the pairs of form tutor groups they are in. New buildings The school has been repeatedly extended in recent years, from the Cavendish library (named for the family surname of the Dukes of Devonshire, the influential aristocratic family of the nearby Chatsworth estate) in the 1990s to a new sixth form centre and sports facilities opened in 2005. This latest extension was funded partly by the sale of the school's boarding house, Castle Hill, which until its sale provided catered accommodation for school pupils. The boarding house closed in 2003. Music and orchestra Lady Manners School Orchestra performing in the Schools' Prom at the Royal Albert Hall Music is a major strength at the school with a wide variety of extra-curricular ensembles including Senior Orchestra (about 80 members), Senior Choir (about 100), Junior Choir (125), Brass Band (10), Senior Wind Band (60), Intermediate Strings, Junior Strings, Intermediate Wind Band, Junior Wind Band, Folk Group, clarinet choir, flute choir, etc. In July 2004, the Lady Manners School Orchestra reached the national finals of the National Festival of Music for Youth and performed in the Royal Festival Hall, London. In July 2005, the orchestra, conducted by Robert Steadman, was awarded \\"outstanding performance\\" at the National Festival Music for Youth Finals at Symphony Hall, Birmingham and in November 2005 they were invited to play at the Schools' Prom at the Royal Albert Hall where the 70+ strong orchestra performed a suite from John Williams' score from Jurassic Park and Elgar's Pomp & Circumstance March No. 1 (Land of Hope and Glory') with indoor fireworks and a 5,000 strong audience singing along. In July 2007 the school's Senior String Orchestra, also conducted by Robert Steadman, was awarded \\"outstanding performance\\" at the National Festival of Music for Youth at Symphony Hall, Birmingham performing a programme of Edward Elgar, Robert Steadman and Edvard Grieg. In July 2008, the music department managed to achieve the unprecedented by having 5 ensembles reach the National Festival of Music for Youth: the School Orchestra (who performed King Arthur a new work written by Jonathan Roberts (a 6th-form student), Nimrod from the \\"Enigma Variations\\" by Elgar and Riverdance by Bill Whelan; the String Orchestra who performed two movements from the St. Paul's Suite by Holst, the Prelude from Psycho by Bernard Hermann and Frolicsome Finale from \\"Simple Symphony\\" by Benjamin Britten; the School Jazz Orchestra who performed a programme of four works including \\"Birdland\\"; the School Brass Band; and the Senior String Quartet who performed Dvo≈ô√°k and Scott Joplin. Since 2004, the music department has taken one ensemble on a short UK tour in the summer term. Most years this has been a combined brass and wind band who have visited places such as London, Edinburgh and Yorkshire giving a number of concerts. In 2009, the Senior Strings visited London and Oxford and gave performances in the Long Library, Blenheim Palace and Keble College chapel in Oxford. There are plans to take the Senior Orchestra to Hungary in summer 2010. Last year (2017), the school orchestra made it to the Music For Youth national competition, playing in the Birmingham main concert hall. In summer 2018, the senior windband are going on tour to Bamberg, Germany, being hosted by the school there. Academic performance It gets well above average GCSE results and A-level results. In 2010, GCSE results placed Lady Manners School 7th in Derbyshire, with 70% of students achieving 5 or more GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and Mathematics (the average in England was 53.5%).

The screenplay, by Rich Eustis and Michael Elias, is drawn from the novel The Serial by Cyra McFadden, published in 1977. Produced by Sidney Beckerman and directed by Bill Persky, the film stars Martin Mull, Tuesday Weld, Sally Kellerman, Christopher Lee, Bill Macy, Peter Bonerz and Tom Smothers. The original music score was composed by Lalo Schifrin. Plot In trendy Marin County, California during the late 1970s, uptight Harvey Holroyd is losing patience rapidly. On one hand, his wife Kate and her friends are thoroughly caught up in the sexual revolution and new age consciousness-raising and psychobabble. On the other hand, his rebellious teenage daughter Joanie is about to join a cult. Harvey's best friend Sam, meanwhile, is having marital troubles, and Harvey is trying to land a higher-paying job with his corporate recruiter Luckman. As marital problems persist, Kate and Harvey separate. Each becomes sexually involved with someone else, albeit rather awkwardly. Harvey tries to avoid the advances of his newly hired secretary, Stella, who lures him to an orgy, but he does begin seeing Marlene, a free-spirited, 19-year- old, strictly vegetarian supermarket cashier. Kate links up with Paco, a bisexual Argentinian aspiring to be an artist, whose profession for now is to trim her dog's hair. Being unhappy at home, Joanie is lured by \\"concerned\\" members of a flower-peddling cult. She goes voluntarily at first and finds peace and tranquility there, but eventually finds herself virtually imprisoned in their house in the big city. Harvey and Kate manage to patch up their differences for Joanie's sake. By means of a little blackmail that ensues from a surprise revelation involving Luckman, a gay motorcycle gang joins forces with Harvey to rescue Joanie. Thus, the Holroyds are reunited and prepare for Harvey's new job in Denver.

For red blood cell formation, see erythropoietin). They may be synthesized and administered exogenously. However, such molecules can at a latter stage be detected, since they differ slightly from the endogenous ones in, e.g., features of post-translational modification. Etymology The name \\"colony-stimulating factors\\" comes from the method by which they were discovered. Hematopoietic stem cells were cultured (see cell culture) on a so- called semisolid matrix, which prevents cells from moving around, so that, if a single cell starts proliferating, all of the cells derived from it will remain clustered around the spot in the matrix where the first cell was originally located. These are referred to as \\"colonies\\". Therefore, it was possible to add various substances to cultures of hemopoietic stem cells and then examine which kinds of colonies (if any) were \\"stimulated\\" by them. The substance that was found to stimulate formation of colonies of macrophages, for instance, was called macrophage colony-stimulating factor, for granulocytes, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and so on.  Mechanism The colony-stimulating factors are soluble (permeable), in contrast to other, membrane-bound substances of the hematopoietic microenvironment. This is sometimes used as the definition of CSFs. They transduce by paracrine, endocrine, or autocrine signaling. Examples Colony-stimulating factors include: * ‚Äì macrophage colony-stimulating factor * ‚Äì Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factors (also called GM-CSF and sargramostim) * ‚Äì Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (also called G-CSF and filgrastim) * Synthetic ‚Äì Promegapoietin  Clinical uses  * Bone marrow stimulation * Stem cell mobilization  References  External links * Cytokines ","title":"Colony-stimulating factor"},{"id":"3823053","title":"Impersonal passive voice"},{"id":"3823057","text":"Open House is a 2004 real estate musical film starring Hedy Burress, Ann Magnuson, Anthony Rapp, Sally Kellerman, Jenna Leigh Green and Kellie Martin, and directed by Dan Mirvish, a co-founder of the Slamdance Film Festival.

It was first collected near Kambarangoh on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo by Lilian Gibbs in 1910 and later mentioned by John Muirhead Macfarlane as \\"Nepenthes sp.\\" in 1914. Although Macfarlane did not formally name the plant, he noted that \\"[a]ll available morphological details suggest that this is a hybrid between N. villosa and N. rajah\\".Macfarlane, J.M. 1914.

The name was first published in Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu, but was a nomen nudum at the time as it lacked an adequate description and information on the type specimen. The name was subsequently published validly by Kurata in 1984.Kurata, S. 1984. Journal of Insectivorous Plant Society 35: 65. The pitchers of N. √ó kinabaluensis may be quite large, but do not compare to those of N. rajah or N. √ó alisaputrana (N. burbidgeae √ó N. rajah). Nepenthes √ó kinabaluensis can only be found on Mount Kinabalu (hence the name) and nearby Mount Tambuyukon, where the two parent species occur sympatrically.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. More specifically, plants are known from a footpath near Paka Cave and several places along an unestablished route on a south-east ridge, which lies on the west side of the Upper Kolopis River.Kurata, S. 1976. Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu. Sabah National Parks Publications No. 2, Sabah National Parks Trustees, Kota Kinabalu. The only accessible location from which this hybrid is known is the Kinabalu summit trail, between Layang-Layang and the helipad, where it grows at about 2900 m in a clearing dominated by Dacrydium gibbsiae and Leptospermum recurvum trees. Nepenthes √ó kinabaluensis has an altitudinal distribution of 2420 to 3030 m.Steiner, H. 2002. Borneo: Its Mountains and Lowlands with their Pitcher Plants. Toihaan Publishing Company, Kota Kinabalu. It grows in open areas in cloud forest. The hybrid is generally intermediate in appearance between its parent species. Raised ribs line the inner edge of the peristome and end with elongated teeth. These are more prominent than those found in N. rajah and smaller than those of N. villosa. The peristome is coarse and expanded at the margin (but not scalloped like that of N. rajah), the lid orbiculate or reniform and almost flat. In general, pitchers are larger than those of N. villosa and the tendril joins the apex about 1‚Äì2 cm below the leaf tip, a feature which is characteristic of N. rajah.Clarke, C.M. 2001. A Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sabah. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. In older plants, the tendril can be almost woody. N. √ó kinabaluensis is an indumentum of villous hairs covering the pitchers and leaf margins, which is approximately intermediate between the parents. Lower pitchers have two fringed wings, whereas the upper pitchers usually lack these. The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet. N. √ó kinabaluensis seems to produce upper pitchers more readily than either of its parents. In all respects N. √ó kinabaluensis is intermediate between the two parent species and it is easy to distinguish from all other Nepenthes of Borneo. However, it has been confused once before, when the hybrid was identified as N. rajah in Letts Guide to Carnivorous Plants of the World.Cheers, G. 1992.

For example, the Proto-Indo-European noun for 'wood' was *dœåru, which in Vedic became dƒÅru. Everywhere else, the outcome was , the same as the reflexes of PIE and . Overview The theory accounts for a number of otherwise puzzling facts. Sanskrit has pitara·∏•, mƒÅtara·∏•, bhrƒÅtara·∏• for \\"fathers, mothers, brothers\\" but svasƒÅra·∏• for \\"sisters\\", a fact neatly explained by the traditional reconstruction of the stems as for \\"father, mother, brother\\" but for \\"sister\\" (cf. Latin pater, mƒÅter, frƒÅter but soror). Similarly, the vast majority of n-stem nouns in Indic have a long stem-vowel, such as brahmƒÅ·πáa·∏• \\"Brahmins\\", ≈õvƒÅna·∏• \\"dogs\\" (from ), correlating with information from other Indo-European languages that they were originally *on- stems. There are also some exceptions, including uk·π£an- \\"ox\\", which in the earliest Indic text, the Rigveda, shows forms as uk·π£«é·πáa·∏• \\"oxen\\". They were later replaced by \\"regular\\" formations (uk·π£ƒÅ·πáa·∏• and so on, some as early as the Rigveda itself), but the notion that the short stem vowel might have been from an -stem is supported by the unique morphology of the Germanic forms: Old English oxa nominative singular \\"ox\\", exen plural; the Old English plural stem, such as the nominative, continues Proto-Germanic *uhsiniz < *uhsenez, with e > i in noninitial syllables followed, in Old English, by an umlaut. This is the only Old English n-stem that certainly points to -vocalism, rather than -vocalism.  Exceptions  The rule seems to apply to only an that is the ablaut alternant of . Non-apophonic , with no alternant, developed into Indo-Iranian : \\"master, lord\\" > Sanskrit pati-, not À£pƒÅti (there is no such root as À£pet- \\"rule, dominate\\"). Alternatively, it is explained by the voiceless consonant after the vowel (see also Sanskrit prati < ), but to adopt a form of the sound law that affects only in open syllables, followed by a voiced consonant, seems to be a slim basis for a rule that is so general in Indo-Iranian. Limiting the original environment to that before voiceless consonants then requires levelling of long-vowel forms to perfects and nouns with final voiceless consonants in Pre-Indo-Iranian. That faces particular problems in explaining the archaic form ƒÅnƒÅ≈õa 'he/she has reached' < , with its very idiosyncratic synchronic relation to Sanskrit ‚àöa≈õ 'reach'. Several exceptions can be addressed by the laryngeal theory. The form that is traditionally reconstructed as *owis \\"sheep\\" (Sanskrit «évi-), is a good candidate for again reconstructing, as (with an o-colouring laryngeal), rather than an ablauting o-grade. Perhaps the most convincing confirmation comes from the inflection of the perfect: a Sanskrit root like sad- \\"sit\\" has sasada for \\"I sat\\" and sasƒÅda for \\"he, she, it sat\\". The conventional 19th century wisdom saw it as some kind of \\"therapeutic\\" reaction to the Indo-Iranian merger of the endings *-a \\"I\\" and *-e \\"he/she/it\\" as -a, but it was troubling that the distinction was found only in roots that ended with a single consonant. That is, dadar≈õa \\"saw\\" is both first- and third-person singular, but a form like À£dadƒÅr≈õa would have been allowed by Sanskrit syllable structure. The mystery was solved when the ending of the perfect in the first person singular was reanalyzed, on the basis of Hittite evidence as *-h‚ÇÇe, beginning with an a-colouring laryngeal. In other words, while Brugmann's Law was still operative, a form of the type in the first-person singular did not have an open root syllable. A problem for the interpretation is that roots that quite plainly must have ended in a consonant cluster including a laryngeal, such as jan- < \\"beget\\" and therefore should have had a short vowel throughout (like dar≈õ- \\"see\\" < ) nevertheless show the same patterning as sad-: jajana first- person singular, jajƒÅna third-person singular. Whether that is a catastrophic failure of the theory or just levelling is unsure, but after all, those who think the pattern seen in roots like sad- has a morphological, not phonological, origin, have their own headaches, such as the total failure of this \\"morphological\\" development to include roots ending in two consonants. Such an argument would anyway cut the ground out from under the neat distributions seen in the kinship terms, the special behaviour of \\"ox\\" and so on. Perhaps the most worrisome data are adverbs such as Sanskrit prati, Greek pros (< ) (meaning \\"motion from or to a place or location at a place\\", depending on the case of the noun that it governs) and some other forms, all of which appear to have ablauting vowels. They also all have a voiceless stop after the vowel, which may or may not be significant.  Current status  For all of its charms, Brugmann's Law now has few supporters, and even Brugmann himself eventually gave up on it). Jerzy Kury≈Çowicz, the author of the explanation of the sasada/sasƒÅda matter (in his √âtudes indoeurop√©ennes I), eventually abandoned his analysis for of an appeal to the theory of marked vs unmarked morphological categories. Scholars who still accept Brugmann's Law include Martin Joachim K√ºmmel, who compares it to developments in Anatolian and Tocharian languages and to Saussure's losses of laryngeals near *o in the internal reconstruction of pre-PIE *o as longer than *e (K√ºmmel 2012:308).

Their musical style started as horror punk and later evolved toward glam rock. They were signed to Tooth & Nail Records. History The Deadlines were founded in 1998 by singer and guitarist, Shaun Sundholm and drummer, Jeremy Abbott. Formerly known as The Oblivious Kids, The Chosen Few, and The Pinheads, the band had played together as early as 1996. Jared Beddingfield joined the band as bass guitarist for only two shows. Brian Jones later joined as bass player. The band recorded a four-song demo cassette and played a handful of shows. It was in 1998, the band began taking on a darker, horror- punk rock sound akin to Murder City Devils, The Damned or The Misfits. With the new sound the band changed their name to The Deadlines. During their years as a horror punk band, the members of The Deadlines used stage names rather than their given names. The first lineup consisted of Sundholm, whose then- stage name was Shaun Coffin, on vocals and guitar; Jeremy Abbott, who went by Jerry Attrick, on drums; and Brian \\"Spencer Spooks\\" Jones bass. The newly re- christened Deadlines began playing shows in the Portland, Oregon, area and soon caught the eye of a local start-up record label, Royal Star Music, and Astoria, Oregon, native Sam Waisanen. Not long after, Sam joined the band as Sammy Lugosi; and they were in a makeshift basement studio, recording their first album for the fledgling label. After the release the band began playing more and more shows, attracting the attention of fellow Astorian, Brent Salo, who quickly signed on to play keyboards under the guise of The Creature From the Brent Lagoon. Not three months later and the band was scheduled to play the growing Christian indie festival TomFest and were attracting the attention of several more well established independent record labels. After their performance at TomFest, audience members expressed that they wanted the band to be signed, chanting \\"Somebody sign these guys!\\". Almost immediately, they were offered a recording contract by Tooth & Nail Records and became the first, and (as of 2006) only horror punk band in the label's history. Two months later, the band recorded their debut album for Tooth & Nail, The Death and Life of..., at the Robert Lang Studios, which had become well known in the 1990s as the place where Nirvana had made their last studio album. Soon after recording their first album, Jones left the band and was replaced by Thomas Demise. The album had not yet been released when Jones left, so Demise was listed as the band's bassist on the full-length; Jones was given credit (as Spencer Spooks) in the album's liner notes. Meanwhile, the band started touring more and more of the United States. The band's lyrics mixed topics regarding death, gore and general horror movie fare with a basis in Christian themes. In live performances and photos, the band members wore old suits and pale makeup, intending to appear that they had recently escaped from coffins. The band's live shows featured blood spitting, fire breathing, and knife wielding extras, which set them apart from other bands in the Pacific Northwest. =Death and life of....= After releasing The Deadlines' song \\"Go, Go to the Graveyard\\" on one of their compilations, Tooth & Nail released The Deadlines' next album, The Death & Life Of..., in March 2000. Tooth & Nail was planning for some controversy regarding the album, and they released it with different album covers for the Christian and secular markets. (Earlier, Tooth & Nail had taken the same approach when releasing Training for Utopia's first full-length, Plastic Soul Impalement.) The album met with some additional controversy in Christian circles, due to its lyrics that dwelt on death, vampires, and drug use, among other topics. The band eventually agreed to include a card inside the \\"Christian market\\" CD case that explained the lyrics to each song. Following the release of the album, The Deadlines hired 2nd guitarist Carlos Col√≥n (a.k.a. Carlos Cadaver) to take over the lead guitar as Shaun Coffin assumed full-time vocal duties. The tour that followed would consist of over the top theatrics including spitting blood, lighting their equipment on fire, and on occasion Sundholm's brother juggling knives. =Fashion Over Function= The Deadlines underwent a major overhaul in October 2000 after their three-month United States tour with The Huntingtons and Squad Five-O, when Sammy Lugosi, Brent Salo (a.k.a. The Creature), Carlos Cadaver and Thomas Demise left the band. Carlos Cadaver moved back to Los Angeles, and then Waisanen, Salo, and Demise went on to start a new project, The Red Sect. After a period of disillusionment, lead singer Shaun, began writing new songs, although in a completely different vein, and once again called on Jerry Attrick to help him flesh the new tunes out. Playing through the new material with Attrick led to the maturation of the new songs from a '60s garage rock to more glam '70s sound. Not wanting to discontinue a still relatively new band, Sundholm and Abbott recruited several new members, namely Joshua Griffith (also known as Shorty Valentine), who had played in Tragedy Ann, and Tim Eurich, of The Killaways. The new incarnation of The Deadlines decided to completely drop the horror schtick, instead favoring a more straightforward sound that blended blues-based rock 'n' roll with glam rock and punk influences. The Deadlines immediately started work on their new album, which was originally called Out on the Streets and was released in November 2001 with the title Fashion Over Function. Soon after, Abbott left the band to start a family and was replaced by Travis Waldie; The Deadlines also added Gerrit Lovesick, who had played with Eurich and Griffith in The Killaways. The Deadlines started 2002 with an album release party, and they were gaining attention and appearing on the covers on local alternative newspapers. At the same time, sales for the second album were not as high as expected; Tooth & Nail was growing more distant, afraid of upsetting the label's Christian market fan-base, and tried to deal the band to several labels both independent and major. Nothing came of the wheeling and dealing and the stress began to wear on Sundholm, who at that point was the only original member left in the band. Tooth & Nail refused to let the Deadlines change their name. In February 2002, Tooth & Nail dropped The Deadlines after they failed to find a new home for the band. The Deadlines continued to tour for several more months but announced in July 2002 that they were disbanding. =Breakup and other projects= Soon after, practically overlapping The Deadlines break up, most of the members (minus Waldie) started a new project called The Bang!, which had a sound similar to The Deadlines' work in Fashion Over Function but with a more raw rock and roll sound. The BANG! included new drummer Linus and was no longer signed to Tooth & Nail. The BANG! recorded a never-released three-song demo while on tour in California; but they disbanded by mid-September 2002, announcing on their website, \\"The Bang! is officially over. Thanks for your interest; stay tuned for whatever's next.\\" Thomas Demise, Sam Waisanen, Jeremy Abbott, Brenton Salo all currently still reside in the Pacific Northwest, Carlos Colon has since been living in Los Angeles, CA. and currently works for Death Waltz Recording Company.

The film also stars Audrey Dalton, Basil Rathbone, Hugh Marlowe, John Carradine, Hope Emerson, Lon Chaney, Jr., Raymond Burr, Natalie Schafer, and Vincent Price (in a cameo appearance as the real Casanova). Plot summary Pippo, a tailor, impersonates Casanova to woo the girls, particularly the widow Bruni. Casanova has left town, pursued by creditors who persuade Pippo to impersonate Casanova at the behest of a Genoan family that will pay \\"Casanova\\" to test the fidelity of the son's betrothed. Pippo, the widow Bruni and Casanova's valet Lucio travel to Venice. The Doge of Venice, \\"a snake with whiskers,\\" to use Pippo's description, intends to use the intended seduction as an excuse to wage war against Genoa. After many humorous adventures, exploiting Pippo's traits of vanity, arrogance and cowardice, the heroine so impresses Pippo with her dignity that he refuses to cooperate in the plot to ruin her character. He is arrested by the Doge and sentenced to death by be heading. A desperate Pippo turns the audience for help, but is shocked when they prefer that he lose his head.

First published in Boulogne, in 1873, The Virtuoso Pianist is Hanon's most well-known work, and is still widely used by piano instructors and pupils. However, the applicability of these nineteenth-century exercises has been questioned by some piano instructors today. Overview The exercises are intended to address common problems which could hamper the performance abilities of a student. These include \\"crossing of the thumb\\", strengthening of the fourth and fifth fingers, and quadruple- and triple- trills. The exercises are meant to be individually mastered and then played consecutively in the sections they are placed in. Apart from increasing technical abilities of the student, when played in groups at higher speeds, the exercises will also help to increase endurance. The exercises are divided in three parts: # Exercises 1 - 20: Labeled \\"preparatory exercises\\", these are also the most famous exercises, and are used to develop finger strength and independence. Each exercise contains a sequence of 8 semiquavers, beginning on C, which is then repeated starting on D, and so on across two octaves. The exercise is then repeated in reverse down two octaves to the starting C. The exercises are intended to be practiced in groups of three, except for the first two which are practiced together. # Exercises 21 - 43: Labeled \\"further exercises for the development of a virtuoso technique.\\" This more difficult section is meant to be played after the pianist has fully mastered Part 1. Part 2 includes scales and arpeggios. # Exercises 44 - 60: Labeled \\"virtuoso exercises for mastering the greatest technical difficulties.\\" Since this section is considerably more difficult, Hanon recommends the mastery of both previous parts before proceeding to this one. This part includes repeated notes, repeated double notes, scales in thirds and octaves, tremolos, and more. After all three parts are mastered, Hanon recommends all exercises be played through daily to retain technique. Criticisms The most common criticism of the Hanon exercises is that having students drill on purely physical exercises results in an unmusical, mechanistic attitude toward the piano. Critics argue that practicing in an unmusical way dulls one's musical instincts, especially when forced upon children and beginners (though in the introduction Hanon does state that the book should be begun a year or so after beginning piano study), who need to cultivate their musicality rather than inure themselves to rote physicality. It is also argued that it is more efficacious to practice one's musicality as one practices one's technique; training in most art forms involves practicing technique, however repetitively, within artistic context. It is further argued that musicality drives technique; the flow of musical expression is a potent motivator to finger agility. In the notes accompanying his work Hanon considered his exercises less \\"dry\\" than other \\"five-finger exercises\\". Some detractors, such as Abby Whiteside have dismissed the very notion of finger independence which they are intended to encourage, insisting instead that only a technique based on the use of the humerus can be effective. Hao Huang believes that \\"Hanon, Schmitt or Czerny have been useful for beginning pianists, affording variety as an alternative to endless practicing of scales and arpeggios\\" but warns against \\"the idea of technical exercises as panacea\\": > There is nothing more dulling than hours spent mindlessly going over finger > patterns. This does not prepare you to be either a pianist or a musician. > Too often, teachers assign technical exercises as a shortcut to technical > mastery. It is easier to assign pages from an exercise book than to analyze > and break down the physical elements in a specific difficult passage of > music... Dorothy Taubman is one of the well known pedagogues who campaigns > against technical exercises, asserting that they do far more damage than > good. Certainly, indiscriminate practicing of exercises can damage a pianist > just as forcing repetition of a difficult piece. In my mind, the question > should not be whether or not to use technical exercises, as much as how to > think physically at the piano. Trivia *In the finale of Dmitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2, the piano part at one point contains a series of running figures which are obviously derived from the Hanon exercises. Since the concerto was dedicated to (and premiered by) his son Maxim, some have suggested that these passages are a reference to the Hanon exercises Shostakovich would have heard his young son practicing. *The pianist and songwriter Bruce Hornsby wrote a song titled \\"Spider Fingers\\" which uses the technique from Exercise 47. Hornsby makes a reference to the technique in the lyrics: \\"It's just a little hand trick/A little prestidigitation/Better get out your Hanon/Practice that repetition\\"  References  External links * A few of the Hanon exercises are available free of charge at http://www.hanon-online.com * Piano √©tudes 1873 compositions ","title":"The Virtuoso Pianist in 60 Exercises"},{"id":"3823152","text":"Portrait of Johan Jakob Borelius Johan Jakob (or Jacob) Borelius (27 July 1823 ‚Äì 1909) was an influential professor of theoretical philosophy at the University of Lund, Sweden from 1866‚Äì1898.

Its principal aims were to protect and improve the environment in Wales and to promote sustainable development. It had an operational area defined along its Eastern boundary by the catchments of the River Dee and the River Wye. Those parts of the River Severn in Wales were managed by the Environment Agency whilst those parts of the River Dee and River Wye catchments that are in England were nevertheless managed by Environment Agency Wales. The Agency also had a public facing boundary which corresponded to the political boundary of Wales. On 1 April 2013 the organisation was merged with the Countryside Council for Wales and Forestry Commission Wales into a single environmental body, Natural Resources Wales.  Role and responsibilities  Environment Agency Wales' role included: reducing industry‚Äôs impacts on the environment, enforcing pollution legislation and reducing the harm caused by flooding and pollution incidents. It also oversaw the management of waste, water resources and freshwater fisheries; cleaning up rivers, coastal waters and contaminated land and improving wildlife habitats. By influencing others to change attitudes and behaviour, it aimed to make the environment cleaner and healthier for people and wildlife.  Priorities  = Act to reduce climate change and its consequences = Environment Agency Wales managed the risk of flooding from rivers and the sea in Wales. To do this, Environment Agency Wales built, maintained and operated flood defences to protect people and property. It also issued flood warnings and works with communities at risk of flooding to help them find appropriate solutions to flood risk through its Flood Awareness Wales programme. When a flood happened, Environment Agency Wales worked with the emergency services and local authorities to minimise the harm to people and damage to property. = Protect and improve water, land and air = Environment Agency Wales was responsible for ensuring that environmental legislation was implemented properly on behalf of the Welsh and UK governments. This included regulating businesses such as power stations, chemical factories, metal processors, waste management sites, construction industry, food and drink manufacturers, farms and the water industry ‚Äì to make sure that their work did not damage the environment. Where people and businesses needed to take water for drinking, industry and irrigation, Environment Agency Wales ensured that they did so without damaging the environment. To do this, Environment Agency Wales gave advice and issued permits, authorisations and consents to businesses that complied with legislative requirements. When pollution occurred, Environment Agency Wales worked to minimise any environmental damage, identify the source and stop any further pollution. If businesses failed to comply with their permits, and pollution occurred, Environment Agency Wales took enforcement action against them, including prosecution on occasion. Environment Agency Wales also led on dealing with serious waste crime which is often organised, large-scale and profitable. Priority waste crime types include large-scale illegal dumping, illegal waste sites and illegal exports of waste. It also dealt with high risk activities such as illegal disposal of wastes, where there was an actual or imminent threat of significant flooding or pollution. = Work with people and communities to create better places = Environment Agency Wales created and improved habitats for fish and other water-based wildlife such as salmon and helped species that were at risk, such as the freshwater pearl mussel. It also managed licences for fishing and navigation, so that people in Wales ‚Äì and people visiting Wales ‚Äì could enjoy the water environment. = Work with businesses and other organisations to use resources wisely = Environment Agency Wales licensed water abstractions from groundwater, rivers and lakes to ensure that the needs of people and business were met whilst protecting the environment and wildlife. It also regulated waste management facilities, such as landfill sites or large composting facilities, to ensure that they did not cause environmental damage and monitored the Landfill Allowances Scheme to track how waste is managed in Wales.  Accreditation  * For the fourth year running, Stonewall Cymru, named Environment Agency Wales as the best place to work in Wales for lesbian, gay and bisexual people in 2012. * Environment Agency Wales was accredited to both the ISO 14001 and EMAS environmental management standard. * As a Welsh Government Public body, Environment Agency Wales had to provide its services within the Welsh political boundary (its public facing boundary) in Welsh as well as in English in accordance with the Welsh Language Act 1993.  Structure  Environment Agency Wales had three operational areas, South East Wales, South West Wales and North Wales. Its other departments were Flood and Coastal Risk Management, Corporate Services, Human Resources, Finance and the policy department known as Strategic Unit Wales. All departments reported to the Director of Environment Agency Wales, Chris Mills. = Senior Management structure = Prior to its merger in early 2013: * Chris Mills - Director, Environment Agency Wales * Steve Brown - Area Manager, South West Wales * Ceri Davies - Strategic Unit Manager * David Edwell - Area Manager, North Wales * Gareth O‚ÄôShea - Area Manager, South East Wales * Andrew Jervis - Finance Manager (Acting) * Helen Davies - Human Resources Manager (Acting) * Graham Hillier - Flood & Coastal Risk Management Manager * Joanne Sherwood - Corporate Services Manager  Committees  Environment Agency Wales had three statutory committees, each with their own responsibility and each contributing towards making Wales a better place for people and wildlife. The committees were set up by Parliament under the Environment Act 1995. The committees were made up of external members who were elected to stand on the committee because they had the relevant expertise. = Environment Protection Advisory Committee Wales (EPAC) = EPAC advised Environment Agency Wales on issues of environmental protection, pollution control, water resources, air quality and waste regulation.

The purpose of these courts was to increase French territory. Louis had been expanding the borders of France in a series of wars. Territory was gained in the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1679 and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1668. The courts' job was to determine what dependencies, if any, had belonged to the areas incorporated into France by these treaties. In doing so, places such as Saarbr√ºcken, Luxembourg, Zweibr√ºcken and Strasbourg were annexed to France. Louis based his claims on ancient, often long-forgotten, rights to the dependent territories stemming from the Middle Ages. He thus took advantage of the formal content of his alliance treaties with the German princes by claiming their land. Although there was no legal claim to it at all, Louis took Strasbourg as well as Casale. Louis also took most of what is now Luxembourg during the War of the Reunions, which was then part of the Holy Roman Empire, while it was distracted by an ongoing war with the Ottoman Empire. The conflicts caused by the Reunion policy ultimately led to the Truce of Ratisbon in which Louis was allowed to keep most gains, partly because of the distraction of other countries and partly by bribes, including payoffs to the German princes and Charles II of England. Louis's hostile policy antagonized much of the rest of Europe, resulting in the War of the League of Augsburg (the Nine Years' War) in 1688. The war ended in 1697 with the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick in which Louis agreed to restore much of the territory that had been \\"reunited\\" with France as a result of the Chambers of Reunion.

Early life Maria Walpole was the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole and Dorothy Clement. Her grandfather was Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford, considered to be the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1721‚Äì41). She grew up at Frogmore House in Windsor, but her parents were not married, and her illegitimate status hindered her social standing despite her family connections. Maria and her daughter Elizabeth by Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1761. Countess Waldegrave On 15 May 1759, she married James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave. The Earl Waldegrave died on 28 April 1763. They had three children: * Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave (1760‚Äì1816) who married her paternal first cousin the 4th Earl Waldegrave * Lady Charlotte Waldegrave (1761‚Äì1808) who married the future 4th Duke of Grafton * Lady Anna Waldegrave (1762‚Äì1801) who married Lord Hugh Seymour, son of the 1st Marquess of Hertford. Anna and Hugh were the great-grandparents of Charles Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer, who was the great-grandfather of Diana, Princess of Wales. There is a portrait of Maria in 1764‚Äì65, shortly after she was widowed, painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery. She also commissioned him in 1780 to paint The Ladies Waldegrave, a group portrait of her and Waldegrave's three daughters. Duchess of Gloucester The Ladies Waldegrave by Sir Joshua Reynolds (L to R: Charlotte, Elizabeth and Anna) Maria (in mourning), by Gainsborough.On 6 September 1766 she married Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, at her home in Pall Mall, London. The Duke was a brother of King George III. The marriage was conducted in secret as the British Royal Family would not have approved of a marriage between a prince and a widow of non-royal rank and illegitimate birth. They lived at St Leonard's Hill in Clewer, near Windsor, and had three children. *Princess Sophia of Gloucester (1773‚Äì1844) *Princess Caroline of Gloucester (1774‚Äì1775) *Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (1776‚Äì1834) The marriage to a commoner of the Duke's other brother, the Duke of Cumberland, led to the passing of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which required all the descendants of George II to seek the sovereign's approval before marriage. It was only in September 1772, five months after the passage of the Act, that the King became aware of Prince William's marriage to Maria. As the Act's provisions could not be applied retroactively, Maria and the Duke's marriage was considered valid. Due, however, to the anger of her brother-in-law at the marriage, she was never received at court. Princess Caroline died aged nine months following a smallpox inoculation, intended to protect her from the disease.

The name can also be a Scandinavian variant of Stephen / Steven. Over the centuries, many northern European rulers have carried the name including Sweyn I of Denmark (Sven Gabelbart).

He is best known, along with his brother George, as a builder of the city of St. John's after the great fire of 1892. Davey was educated at the Central School in St. John‚Äôs and underwent an apprenticeship with his father, also a carpenter, forming a partnership between father and son. Upon the death of his father, he went into business with his brother George and to form E.H. and G. Davey, Contractors, Builders and Ships Joiners. The company‚Äôs offices were located at 111 Bond Street with wharf and stores situated on the St. John‚Äôs waterfront. In the aftermath of the great fire of 1892, there was great demand for architects, contractors and builders. The Davey brothers were at the forefront of this massive effort and were responsible for many of the new buildings that were erected in the months following the fire: * The Church of England Orphanage * the British Hall * the restoration of the Church of England Cathedral of St. John the Baptist By 1900, the company was very successful and Davey decided to enter politics. In the November 8, 1900, both Davey and his running mate, Henry Gear, won the dual district of Burin for the Liberal Party, led by Robert Bond. Davey spent 11 years as MHA for Burin. He was re-elected in the general election of 1904. Davey and Gear were returned to the House of Assembly in the famous tie- election of 1908. He was re-elected in the 1909 election. Davey was involved in many facets of the Church of England, serving on the Diocesan Synod for Newfoundland, as a member of the Vestry at the Cathedral and as a member of the Cathedral Restoration Committee. He was a long-time member of St. John‚Äôs Lodge No. 5 of the Society of United Fishermen, a philanthropic and fraternal organization founded in Heart‚Äôs Content in 1871.

The first part, \\"Funeral for a Friend\\", is an instrumental created by John while thinking of what kind of music he would like at his funeral. This first half segues into \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\". Composition and recording In the Eagle Vision documentary, Classic Albums: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, John said the two songs were not written as one piece, but fit together since \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" ends in the key of A, and \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\" opens in A, and the two were played as one elongated piece when recorded. With lyrics like \\"And love lies bleeding in my hand/Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man\\", lyricist Bernie Taupin uses death symbolism as an angry take on a breakup song. The grandiose introduction to \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" was performed on an ARP synthesizer (erroneously credited as A.R.P.) by the album's engineer, David Hentschel, who, John recalled, overdubbed track after track of music and synthetic atmospheric effects until the mini-opus was complete. In an interview for John's official website, Hentschel recalled that he used melodies from \\"The Ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-1934)\\", \\"I‚Äôve Seen That Movie, Too\\", \\"Candle In The Wind\\" and others in creating the track. Release and reception The song was well received by critics. AllMusic's Donald Guarisco called \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" \\"a stunning instrumental\\" with \\"a powerful fusion of classical and rock elements where a gentle, lyrical motif is developed and energized until it builds into a powerhouse full of emotion and bombast.\\" \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" was too long for a single release, but got significant airplay on FM stations that were predisposed toward rock epics. The whole piece is just over 11 minutes long. A fan favourite, it became a staple part of many Elton John tour set lists. Billboard magazine listed this song as number two in the list of Elton John's best songs as picked by critics, second only to \\"Bennie and the Jets\\". Rolling Stone readers picked this song as number three in a list of \\"deep cuts\\" by Elton John, songs that only a true fan would know, even though it has received significant exposure over the years. The song had a strong influence on the Guns N' Roses Use Your Illusion albums and, in particular, the song \\"November Rain\\". Avenged Sevenfold's M.

Formerly known as ABC Radio News, ABC News Radio feeds, through Skyview Networks, five minute newscasts on the hour and news briefs at half-past the hour, to its network affiliates. ABC News Radio is the largest commercial radio news organization in the US. ABC Radio aired the first broadcast report of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Kennedy was shot in Dallas, Texas, at 18:30 UTC and Don Gardiner anchored the initial bulletin at 18:36:50 UTC, minutes before any other radio or television network. History Beginning in the late 1950s, ABC fed hourly newscasts to affiliates at 5 minutes before the hour, to contrast it with CBS Radio News and NBC Radio News, which sent its newscasts to affiliates at the top of each hour. On January 1, 1968, the singular ABC radio network was split into four separate and distinct programming services. The American Contemporary Network, on major-market contemporary music stations like WABC New York, aired news at 5 minutes before the hour. American Information Network news ran at the top of the hour on major-market talk and information stations like KGO San Francisco. The American FM Network, carried on major- market FM stations such as WPLJ New York, aired news geared toward young adult listeners at 15 minutes past the hour, while the American Entertainment Network had news at the bottom of the hour, often carried by AM country music stations, such as WBAP in Dallas-Fort Worth. ABC News Radio logo used from 2007 to 2013.Before the split, ABC reached an understanding with the FCC concerning the \\"Chain Broadcasting\\" rule, which forced the sale of the NBC Blue Network and enabled ABC's creation in 1943. Each of the four networks could be cleared only when no other ABC network was on the air in a particular market. Though each of the four new \\"networks\\" were distributed to all member radio stations nationally over the same broadcast-quality telephone line, the move allowed ABC to have as many as four affiliates in one city ‚Äî a major competitive advantage and a dramatic turning point in the history of network radio. Two additional news networks, ABC Rock and ABC Direction, were added on January 4, 1982, after the network became a satellite-delivered service. The network was strict in its insistence that there be no simultaneous broadcast of more than a single network in a market, except during crisis or special event coverage. After the sale of most of ABC's radio assets to Citadel Broadcasting in 2007, the ABC Radio Network was operated by the broadcaster as part of the Citadel Media Networks division, and still distributed ABC News content. Citadel Broadcasting was later acquired by Cumulus Media. In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News, and begin a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content via the new Westwood One News network for its stations, beginning on January 1, 2015. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house under a revived ABC Radio, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks. Despite many of ABC's former heritage radio properties no longer carrying any ABC programming, ABC is affiliated with some other heritage radio stations, including WTOP Washington, WLW Cincinnati, KOA Denver, KOMO Seattle, KTRS St. Louis, KSL Salt Lake City and KMBZ Kansas City. Before being acquired by Westwood One, ABC News Radio programming was available in podcast form on iHeart due to Cumulus radio stations streaming on iHeart. When Cumulus started using Westwood One/CNN for their national news, ABC News Radio's digital presence was moved exclusively to Slacker (now LiveXLive). While some of ABC's heritage radio stations use Westwood One News for their national news provider, a few Cumulus stations formerly affiliated with ABC (example KARN-FM Little Rock) carry CBS. Format Of the six networks, only Information, Entertainment and ABC FM News remain as separate newscast services today, with their programming delivered via satellite. The \\"Information\\" network newscasts clear on major-market stations. \\"Entertainment\\" network news airs mainly on small and medium-market stations. ABC FM News newscasts air on a small number of FM music stations. These ABC News Radio newscasts originate from the news division's bureaus in New York, Washington and Los Angeles and air exactly at the top of the hour. The standard format is the same for all three, with the Entertainment and FM networks having shorter stories and the Information network having slightly longer stories and more global coverage. Individual soundbites and reporter packages are fed to stations via satellite and an affiliate website. In addition to the top-of-the-hour newscasts, ABC News also provides its radio affiliates with headlines, briefs and \\"status reports\\" that air every ten minutes, as well as special reports, special event coverage and longform programming. News & Comment ABC News Radio produced News and Comment, a twice-daily long-form program hosted by broadcaster Paul Harvey, who also would read the program's commercial messages in a seamless transition. This program originated from Chicago and began its run in 1951. On January 1, 1968, News and Comment became a part of ABC's \\"American Entertainment Network\\", although the program was also heard on stations affiliated with the other ABC Networks, if the \\"Entertainment\\" affiliate was not as powerful as another ABC affiliate in a given market. A five-minute long spin-off voiced by Harvey, The Rest of the Story, began in May 1976 and was offered to affiliates in the late afternoons, as well as on Saturday mornings. After Paul Harvey's death on February 28, 2009, San Francisco-based broadcaster Gil Gross was appointed as the new host of News and Comment, while the Rest of the Story time slot was held by Doug Limerick. Shortly after their appointments, however, Mike Huckabee was hired to host his own thrice-daily commentary program, The Huckabee Report, offered to stations that had been carrying both programs in the same time slots. This program, however, was produced by the former ABC Radio Network, at that point rebranded as Citadel Media, eventually becoming Cumulus Media and finally Westwood One. Huckabee took over distribution of the program himself as a digital-only feature in 2015.

Although ambrein itself is odorless, it serves as the biological precursor for a number of aromatic derivatives such as ambroxan and is thought to possess fixative properties for other odorants. It has been shown to act as an analgesic and it has been proven to increase sexual behavior in rats, providing some support for its traditional aphrodisiac use. Apart from it supposed aphrodisiac effects, ambrein has been shown to decrease spontaneous contractions of smooth muscles in rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. It is able to reduce these contractions by serving as an antagonist and interfering with the Ca2+ ions from outside of the cell.  Biosynthesis  Ambrein is synthesized from common triterpenoid precursor squalene. The Squalene-hopene cyclase(SHC) catalyzes cyclization of squalene into the monocyclic 3-deoxyachilleol A.

History In the early nineteenth century, the most common currency used in the East Indies was the Spanish dollar, including issues both from Spain and from the new world Spanish colonies, most significantly Mexico. Locally issued coinages included the Kelantan and Trengganu keping, and the Penang dollar. In 1826, the Indian rupee was made the sole official currency in the Straits Settlements, as it was administered as part of India. However, the Indian Rupee was unsuitable for trade and Spanish dollars continued to be used for trade. 1844 saw the authorization of copper coinage for the Straits Settlements using a system of 100 cents = 1 dollar, with the dollar equal to the Spanish dollar or Mexican peso. This coinage was declared current in the Straits Settlements on 1 June 1847. In 1867, administration of the Straits Settlements was separated from India and the dollar was made the standard currency. From 1899, the Straits dollar was issued by a new Board of Commissioners of Currency and private banks were prevented from issuing notes. Its value depreciated over the next eight years and was then pegged at two shillings four pence sterling in 1906. The Straits dollar was replaced at par by the Malayan dollar in 1939. Brunei and Singapore acknowledged the successor to this currency unit, although Malaysia rescinded in 1973. A memoranda of understanding, Currency Interchangeability Agreement, was signed between the Brunei‚ÄìSingapore relations which makes both Brunei dollar and Singapore dollar banknotes and coins legal tender vice versa in each other's country. Coins The first coins issued for the Straits Settlements in 1845 were , and 1 cent denominations in copper. They were issued by the East India Company and did not bear any indication of where they were to be used. The original dies were engraved by William Wyon, Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint. They were first struck at the Calcutta Mint, and later in 1858 also at the Madras Mint. In 1858, administration of the Straits Settlements was transferred from the East India Company to the Crown, and the Straits Settlements came under the Government of British India. A second issue of the same denominations was struck in 1862 at the Indian Government Mint, Calcutta. These bore the inscription \\"India - Straits\\". In 1871, silver coins were issued in the name of the Straits Settlements for 5, 10 and 20 cents, followed by copper , and 1 cent the next year and silver 50 cents in 1886. Silver dollars were first minted in 1903. A 3-page special issue of the Straits Settlements Government Gazette published in Singapore on 24 August 1904, contained the following proclamation by then Governor, Sir John Anderson: The purpose of this action was to create a separate exchange value for the new Straits dollar as compared with the other silver dollars that were circulating in the region, notably the British trade dollar. The idea was that when the exchange value had diverged significantly from that of the other silver dollars, then the authorities would peg it to sterling at that value, hence putting the Straits Settlements unto the gold exchange standard. This pegging occurred when the Straits dollar reached the value of two shillings and four pence (2s 4d) against sterling. Within a few years, the value of silver rose rapidly such as to make the silver value of the Straits dollar higher than its gold exchange value. To prevent these dollars from being melted down, a new smaller dollar was issued in 1907 with a reduced silver content. A parallel story occurred in the Philippines at the same time. The last cent coins were issued in 1916. Dollars were last struck for circulation in 1926, with 50 cents production ending in 1921. The remaining coins continued in production until 1935. Banknotes The Board of Commissioners of Currency introduced 5 and 10 dollar notes in 1898, followed by 50 and 100 dollars in 1901 and 1 dollar in 1906. Emergency issues of 10 and 25 cents were made between 1917 and 1920. 1000 dollar notes were issued in 1930 but during the remainder of the 1930s only 1, 5 and 10 dollar notes were issued. =Straits Settlements government issues (1899‚Äì1942)= Queen Victoria (1837‚Äì1901) The Government of Straits Settlements was first authorised to issue currency notes by Ordinance VIII of 1897, which came into operation on 31 August 1898. These notes, although dated 1 September 1898, were not issued to the public until 1 May 1899. Both the Chartered Bank and Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank continued to issue banknotes, which circulated side by side with the official currency. All notes were freely exchangeable with the Mexican dollar or the various other silver coins that were legal tender in the Colony. Fifty Straits dollar banknote from 1925 King Edward VII (1901‚Äì1910) King Edward ascended the throne in January 1901. In the previous issue the 5-dollar note had been of almost the same size and design as the 10-dollar. It was now reduced in size to help recognition. The series dated 1 February 1901 were printed by Thomas de la Rue & Co. Ltd. of London. In 1903, a dollar-sized coin in silver was minted specially for the Straits Settlements, and this became the standard unit of value. All other silver dollars at that time circulation were demonetised by 1904. A steep rise in the price of silver, however, soon forced the government to call in the first issue of this Straits dollar and to replace it with a coin of lower silver content. During the change over period, fear of a shortage of coin led to the introduction of the one-dollar note, fixed at an exchange rate against gold instead of silver. To effect this, the British gold sovereign was for the first time declared legal tender, and the Straits dollar was given an arbitrary value of two shillings and four pence sterling. This dollar note proved so popular that it was retained in all future issues, so that to a very large extent it replaced the need for the silver coin. By the end of 1906, the currency circulation had risen to $21,866,142, while that of the private banks had fallen to $1,329,052 (20th Century Impressions of British Malaya p. 138). The one-dollar notes, which were dated 1 September 1906, were printed by the London firm of Thomas de la Rue & Co. Ltd.. A five-dollar and a ten-dollar note both dated 8 June 1909, were printed Thomas de la Rue & Co. Ltd.. Ten Straits Dollar banknote from 1927 King George V (1910‚Äì1936) During this reign the range of currency notes was extended up to one thousand dollars for the convenience of inter-bank clearing transactions. In 1915, it was decided to make a complete change in the design of the 50, 100 and 1000 dollar notes. These denominations were first issued to the public in February 1920, October 1919 and May 1917 respectively. They were printed by Thomas de la Rue. A 10,000 note was first issued in October 1922. This was not available to the public, but was used exclusively in inter-bank transfers. King Edward VIII (1936) No special issue of notes was made during this brief reign. King George VI (1936‚Äì1952) In September 1933, Sir Basil Phillott Blackett was appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to lead a commission to consider the participation of the various Malay States, including Brunei, in the profits and liabilities of the Straits Settlements currency. The Blackett Report recommended that the sole power of issuing currency for the area should be entrusted to a pan-Malayan Currency Commission. This recommendation was adopted by the Government of the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States, Unfederated Malay States and Brunei. Legislation was enacted by the Straits Settlements Currency Ordinance (No. 23) of 1938, and ratified by the various states during 1939 and the Malayan dollar became legal tender in the Straits Settlements.

A member of the Portola expedition in 1769, Ortega stayed on to become the patriarch of an important Californio family. Early life Ortega was born in 1734 at Celaya, Guanajuato Province, New Spain, where he worked as a warehouse clerk. Little else is known about his youth. In October 1755 he enlisted in the military as a private soldier to serve at the Royal Presidio at Misi√≥n Nuestra Se√±ora de Loreto in Baja California. In 1759 Ortega married Mar√≠a Antonia Victoria Carrillo (ca. 1742 - May 1803), daughter of another soldier, at Loreto. Some time after being promoted to sergeant in February 1757, Ortega left active duty to mine in Baja California and became alcalde (administrative and judicial officer) of mining camps in the southern part of the peninsula. Ortega rejoined the army in 1768, having been recruited by California Governor Gaspar de Portol√° to join his expedition to explore and settle Alta California. Alta California Sergeant Ortega was the chief scout during the second phase of Gaspar de Portol√†'s land expedition to explore and extend the northern boundary of Las Californias. After establishing a base at San Diego in July, 1769, Portola led a reduced party that pushed on to the north. At the northern extreme of that march, Ortega led a scouting party that encountered San Francisco Bay on November 1, 1769, and was one of the first Europeans to see the bay. In 1773 Ortega became Lieutenant and Commandant of the Presidio of San Diego, a post he held until 1781. Previously he was Acting Commandant from July 1771 in the absence of Pedro Fages. As Commandant he went with Fray Ferm√≠n Lasu√©n and twelve soldiers to explore the site chosen for Mission San Juan Capistrano. Ortega was a favorite of the missionaries, including Jun√≠pero Serra. In the spring of 1782, Ortega was on the expedition that founded Mission San Buenaventura and the Presidio of Santa Barbara. Ortega became the first Commandant of the Presidio of Santa Barbara that year, and remained until 1784. During 1787-1791 he was Commandant of the Presidio of Monterey,and in 1792 the Commandant of the Presidio in Loreto. Retirement In 1795 he retired as brevet captain with 40 years of service. Ortega was given a Spanish \\"land concession\\" in 1794, which he named Rancho Nuestra Se√±ora del Refugio (Rancho Refugio) near Santa Barbara. He built his ranch here, but didn't enjoy it long. On February 3, 1798, Ortega fell from his horse and died at age 65 near the Indian village of Casil at Refugio Beach. He was buried at Mission Santa Barbara the following day. Family Ortega's descendants became one of the prominent Californio families. His son Ygnacio was the 1809 grantee of Rancho San Ysidro. Granddaughter Maria de Guadalupe married the naturalized American Joseph John Chapman. Granddaughter Maria del Pilar Ortega married Santiago Arg√ºello, alcalde of San Diego and grantee of the Rancho ex-Mission San Diego and the Rancho Tijuana \\"The Rancho T√≠a Juana (Tijuana) Grant\\" by Antonio Padilla Corona, The Journal of San Diego History 50 (Winter/Spring 2004).

Proteasome inhibitors are drugs that block the action of proteasomes, cellular complexes that break down proteins. They are being studied in the treatment of cancer; and three are approved for use in treating multiple myeloma. Mechanism Multiple mechanisms are likely to be involved, but proteasome inhibition may prevent degradation of pro-apoptotic factors such as the p53 protein, permitting activation of programmed cell death in neoplastic cells dependent upon suppression of pro-apoptotic pathways. For example, bortezomib causes a rapid and dramatic change in the levels of intracellular peptides. Examples * The first non-peptidic proteasome inhibitor discovered was the natural product lactacystin. * Disulfiram has been proposed as another proteasome inhibitor. * Epigallocatechin-3-gallate has also been proposed. * Marizomib (salinosporamide A) has started clinical trials for multiple myeloma. * Oprozomib (ONX-0912), delanzomib (CEP-18770) have also started clinical trials. * Epoxomicin is a naturally occurring selective inhibitor. * MG132 is a synthesized peptide commonly used for in vitro studies. * Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate is a proteasome inhibitor in human skeletal muscle in vivo.

Career  Appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the Plymouth militia regiment in 1775, Alden first saw action serving with the 25th Continental Regiment during the Siege of Boston. Following his promotion to Colonel in November 1776, Alden was assigned to the 7th Massachusetts Regiment stationed at the garrison of Cherry Valley, New York. Although commanding between 200 and 300 men, Alden's limited military experience and lack of knowledge regarding local Indian tactics or customs would prove to be a great disadvantage as in early November 1778, receiving a warning of an attack by local tribes, Alden made minimal preparations. On November 11, 1778, a combined force of 600 ns led by Joseph Brant and 200 Tories known as Butler's Rangers under Major Walter Butler launched a surprise attack after the capture of several of Alden's scouts provided intelligence of the situation in the valley. In the attack 32 civilians and 16 soldiers were killed, and 71 residents were captured. The officers of the regiment were quartered in private homes, and Alden was killed in an attempt to reach the fort from a house on the outskirts of the fort. His executive officer, Lt. Col.

Events In the first half of the Sixteenth Century, various forms of Protestantism‚Äîparticularly, Lutheranism and Calvinism‚Äîwere spreading through a great part of Europe. In the Low Countries, then under the rule of Spain, Emperor Charles V and his son King Philip II instituted a systematic campaign to root out the new religious movements, which resulted in a certain level of political resentment towards the authorities, including the Catholic Church. By 1572 the Netherlands were in open revolt against Spanish rule, while in the internal rivalry among the Protestant denominations, Calvinism managed to suppress Lutheranism. On 1 April of the next year, Calvinist forces and a rebel group called the Watergeuzen (Sea Beggars) captured Brielle (Den Briel) and later Vlissingen (Flushing).Albers, Petrus Henricus. \\"The Martyrs of Gorkum\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia.

To these were added two lay brothers from the same friary, Petrus of Assche and Cornelius of Wijk bij Duurstede. At almost the same time the Calvinists arrested the parish priest of Gorkum, Leonardus Vechel of 's-Hertogenbosch, and his assistant. Also imprisoned were Godefried van Duynsen of Gorkum, a priest in his native city, and Joannes Lenartz of Oisterwijk, a canon regular from a nearby priory and spiritual director for the monastery of Augustinian nuns in Gorkum. To these fifteen were later added four more companions: Joannes van Hoornaer (alias known as John of Cologne), a Dominican of the Cologne province and parish priest not far from Gorkum, who when apprised of the incarceration of the clergy of Gorkum hastened to the city in order to administer the sacraments to them and was seized and imprisoned with the rest; Jacobus Lacops of Oudenaar, a Norbertine, who became a curate in Monster, South Holland; Adrianus Janssen of Hilvarenbeek, a Premonstratensian canon and at one time parish priest in Monster, who was sent to Brielle with Jacobus Lacops. Last was Andreas Wouters of Heynoord.

On their way to Dordrecht they were exhibited for money to the curious. The following day, William de la Marck, Lord of Lumey, commander of the Gueux de mer, had them interrogated and ordered a disputation. In the meantime, four others arrived. It was demanded of each that he abandon his belief in the Transubstantiation, the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, as well as the belief in the Papal supremacy. All remained firm in their faith. Meanwhile, there came a letter from the Prince of Orange, William the Silent, which enjoined all those in authority to leave priests and religious unmolested. Despite this call, on 9 July, they were hanged in a turfshed. Veneration A shrub bearing 19 white flowers is said to have sprung up at the site of their martyrdom.

Edusat is a portmanteau of \\"education\\" and \\"satellite\\". History The government of Mexico implemented Telesecundaria in 1968 to provide secondary education to students in rural areas through broadcast television channels, such as XHGC-TV in Mexico City. With the launching of the Morelos II satellite, Telesecundaria began transmitting on one of its analog channels in 1988. In 1994, Telesecundaria began broadcasting in a digital format with the advent of the Solidaridad I satellite, and Edusat was born and began transmitting on six channels. The signal was moved to Solidaridad II in 2000. In 2008 Edusat services migrated to Satmex 5, by this time with signal power five times what it was during the Morelos II era and the number of channels increased to 10 with capacity for six more and a larger area of coverage. Today, Televisi√≥n Educativa resources are received by more than 36,000 set-top boxes located in Mexico and 1,000 in other areas of the continent. The technological component is managed by the Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) and Telecomunicaciones de M√©xico (Telecomm). Although the signal is available in all of the Americas (except for the eastern part of Brazil) Edusat services are only offered in Mexico, Central America and certain regions of the United States. In early August 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the Mexican government signing contracts with commercial TV broadcasters Televisa, TV Azteca, Grupo Imagen, and Grupo Multimedios, the public TV broadcasters and 36 radio stations to air school student targeted programming over their networks. Each of the four commercial TV broadcasters will launch a new subchannel on their digital broadcasting multiplexes. The programming will be designed by the Ministry of Public Education (SEP) and Canal Once. From 8am to 7pm every weekday from August 24, more than 4,550 television programs and 640 radio programs will be broadcast in 20 languages at primary and high school level. Services Edusat transmits 13 television services, seven of which it programs, in addition to three public radio stations: =Edusat-programmed= *11 Telesecundaria (for secondary students) *12 (to teach teachers, was previously called \\"TV Docencia\\") *17 (for senior secondary students) *24 (for secondary students and adults) *26 Especiales (special events channel) *27 Telesecundaria+ (for secondary students) *30 (for learners of all ages) Ingenio Tv is also available outside of the Edusat system on some terrestrial SPR multiplexes.

His sculptures can be found in churches, numerous public institutions, outdoor locations, and museums, including the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, as well as in many private collections. Umlauf received a number of accolades, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Ford Foundation Grant. In 1941 Umlauf accepted a position at the University of Texas School of Art in Austin, Texas, where he taught for 40 years. Artists teaching at UT included Loren Mozley, Everett Spruce, Kelly Fearing, Seymour Fogel, and William Lester. Umlauf retired as Professor Emeritus in 1981. In 1985, he and his wife Angeline Allen Umlauf gave their Austin home, Umlauf‚Äôs studio, and 168 sculptures to the City of Austin. Based on this gift and considerable community support, the UMLAUF Sculpture Garden and Museum was founded and opened its doors in 1991 as at 605 Azie Morton Road in Austin, Texas. The UMLAUF is a private‚Äìpublic partnership with the City of Austin.  Early life  Charles Umlauf was born in South Haven, Michigan, on a large farm where his family lived and worked. He was the sixth of eight children born to immigrant parents Christian Heinrich (Bavarian) and Charlotte Derouet (French-Alsatian). The Umlauf children were named Heinrich, Marie, Charlotte, Wilhelm, Edouard, Karl, Emelia, and Louis. The family moved frequently in search of work. The Umlauf family suffered from anti-German sentiment during the first World War. The family Americanized their names (Heinrich to Henry, Wilhelm to William, Karl to Charles) to avoid persecution in their Michigan town and schools. After enactment of the Espionage Act of 1917, Umlauf‚Äôs father was falsely accused of spying while working at an ammunition plant. Soon after, the windows were shattered in the family home. This treatment would influence the subjects and expression in Charles‚Äô work. In 1918 the entire family relocated to Chicago in search of greater opportunities for work. Umlauf discovered sculpture early in his life, when he was a child, playing in the sand at Lake Michigan. He watched a sand artist on the beach, and subsequently sculpted a life-size sand sculpture of his own. Umlauf claimed that he knew at the age of ten that he was going to be a sculptor. At this age, he was living with his family in Chicago. In 1922, Christian Umlauf died, further impoverishing the family. Charlotte Umlauf died only 6 years later, leaving the children orphans and emotionally devastated. Charlotte had been a fervent supporter of artistic education for her children, spending a portion of their meager income on music lessons for Charles and his siblings.  Work  In 1918, when Charles was eight years old, the Umlauf family moved to Chicago. Charles and his brothers worked as caddies at Oak Park and Bryn Mawr Country Clubs. Charles was encouraged to pursue his artistic interests by his sister, Marie, who paid for her 11-year-old brother to attend weekend classes at the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC). He soon earned a scholarship for continued study. Umlauf was interested in carving and forming figures from an early age. Based on a small lion he molded in clay, Charles received his first commission of a full-sized lion in 1922, at age eleven. In 1929 Umlauf began three years of study with Albin Polasek at the AIC. He subsequently spent one year as an assistant to Lorado Taft at his Midway Studio before returning to the AIC where he remained until 1937. Those years saw a growth in Umlauf's interest in the more abstract sculptures being produced in Europe, and as a consequence, his own art became increasingly abstracted. From 1934 through 1941, Umlauf was employed by the WPA Federal Art Project, created during the Great Depression. He sculpted for several Federal projects, including two monumental sculptural heads for Merchandise Mart and sculptures for Cook County Hospital. His 1939 work War Mother caught the attention of Marion Koogler McNay and professors at the newly formed Art Department at the University of Texas at Austin. They offered him a position as Professor of Life Drawing and Sculpture and the Umlaufs permanently moved to Austin in 1943. Mentorship During his tenure at the University of Texas, Charles Umlauf taught many art students, including Farrah Fawcett. Fawcett, an art major, called Umlauf her \\"favorite professor\\" and they began a close mentoring relationship. Fawcett took classes and worked with Umlauf in his studio, as well as occasionally sitting for him as a muse. Her sculpture work is similar to Umlauf's in style. Work by Fawcett was exhibited at the UMLAUF in 2017 in the Mentoring a Muse exhibition.List of Past Exhibitions at Umlauf Another of his pupils was Bob \\"Daddy-O\\" Wade, who studied at the University of Texas from 1961-65, and later became famous for his larger-than- life sized works inspired by Texan cowboy culture.

Situated in the Nizamuddin West area of Delhi, the dargah is visited by thousands of pilgrims every week. The site is also known for its evening qawwali devotional music sessions. The descendants of Nizamuddin Auliya look after the whole management of dargah Sharif. Architecture The tombs of Amir Khusrau, Nizamuddin's disciple, and Jehan Ara Begum, Shah Jahan's daughter, are located at the entrance to the complex. Ziauddin Barani and Muhammad Shah are also buried here. Overall, the dargah complex has more than 70 graves. The complex was renovated and restored by the Aga Khan Trust around 2010. =Dargah= Nizamuddin's mausoleum Nizamuddin's tomb has a white dome. The main structure was built by Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1325, following Nizamuddin's death. Firuz Shah Tughlaq later repaired the structure and suspended four golden cups from the dome's recesses. Khurshid Jah of Hyderabad gifted the marble balustrade that surrounds the grave. The present dome was built by Faridun Khan in 1562. The structure underwent many additions over the years. The dome is about six metres in diameter. The dargah is surrounded by a marble patio and is covered with intricate jaalis (). The dargah complex also has a wazookhana (). =Jamat Khana Masjid= Interior of the masjid Next to the dargah is the Jamat Khana Masjid. This mosque is built of red sandstone and has three bays. Its stone walls are carved with inscriptions of texts from the Quran. The mosque has arches that have been embellished with lotus buds, in addition to the facade of its dome having ornamental medallions. The structure was built during the reign of Alauddin Khalji by his son Khizr Khan. Completed between 1312‚Äî13, Khizr was responsible for the central dome and hall, and was a follower of Nizamuddin. Around 1325, when Muhammad bin Tughlaq took over the reign, he constructed the two adjoining halls, each of which has two domes. The southern hall, chhoti masjid () is restricted to women and features a wooden door. The large dome of the mosque features a golden bowl that is suspended from the centre. =Baoli= At the back entrance of the complex is a baoli (), commissioned by Nizamuddin himself and completed in 1321. It is close to the Yamuna river and is always filled. People believe that its waters have magical powers and bathe in it. According to legend, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq had commissioned the Tughlaqabad Fort at the same time the baoli was being built. Because he forbade all workers from working on the baoli, they would work on it at night. Upon discovering this, the supply of oil was restricted. The masons then lit their lamps with the water of the baoli, after a blessing. Location The neighborhood surrounding the dargah, Nizamuddin Basti, is named after the saint. The area was initially the site of the settlement of Ghiyaspur, where Nizamuddin lived, and was later named after him. The Basti's population mainly grew after refugees settled here during the Partition of India. Prior to that, the area was mainly occupied only by the pirzade, the direct descendants of Nizamuddin. Market in Nizamuddin area Sabz Burj on the traffic circle near the dargah The Basti area has small lodges, small eateries and shops selling elements related to Islamic culture, such as religious books, kurtas, skull caps and ittar (). It also has butcher shops. The area is divided into two parts along Mathura Road: Nizamuddin West where the Dargah complex and a lively market dominated by Muslim vendors is located, and Nizamuddin East, where the Nizamuddin Railway Station is situated. The area has been a hub for cultural activities in Delhi since the 13th century, leading to many building important buildings in close proximity to the area. This includes Humayun's Tomb and Sunder Nursery, a 16th century heritage park. The tombs of Mirza Ghalib and Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana are also located in this area due to its cultural significance. The other important monuments in the Nizamuddin heritage area include Barakhamba and Lal Mahal. The dargah complex is immediately surrounded by the Sabz Burj at the intersection of Lodhi Road and Mathura Road, the Urs Mahal (a stage for the qawwalis) and the Chausath Khamba. Culture left The area is referred to as the \\"nerve centre of Sufi culture in India\\". On the 17th and 18th day of the Islamic month of Rabi' al-awwal, thousands gather to observe the birth anniversary and urs (death anniversary) of the saint. Besides this, thousands also visit on the birth and death anniversaries of Amir Khusrau, Nizamuddin's disciple. Hundreds visit the dargah everyday throughout the year to pray and pay their respects. The dargah has a tradition of qawwali, especially the one on every Thursday night attracting about 1500 visitors. The regular qawwalis occur every evening after the Maghrib prayer. The dargah has multiple intergenerational darbari qawwals. Women are traditionally not allowed inside the dargah. Besides this, the dargah organizes a daily langar. The evening prayers in which lamps are lit, called the Dua-e-Roshni, is an important ritual. Pilgrims gather around the khadim, the caretaker, who prays for the wishes of all those gathered to be granted. Death is celebrated in most Sufi orders. As part of the urs, the dargah complex and the tombs are lit up in the tradition of charaghan. Lakhs of people from different religions come from across the world and recite verses in the tradition of fateha. Plates of rose petals and sweets are offered to the tombs and fragrant chaddars () are draped on them. People tie colourful threads on the jaalis and make vows (mannat) to the saints. Each thread symbolizes a wish. The festival of Basant Panchami is also celebrated at the dargah. According to legend, Nizamuddin was deeply attached to his nephew, Khwaja Taqiuddin Nuh, who passed away due to an illness. Nizamuddin grieved over him for a long time. Khusrau, his disciple, wanted to see him smile and dressed up in yellow and began celebrating the onset of Basant, after spotting some women do the same. This caused Auliya to smile, an occasion that is commemorated to this day. In popular culture \\"Arziyan\\", a qawwali in the 2009 film Delhi 6 composed by A. R. Rahman is dedicated to Nizamuddin Auliya. \\"Kun Faya Kun\\", a song in the 2011 movie Rockstar and again composed by Rahman, is also shot at the dargah, featuring Ranbir Kapoor and Nizami Bandhu, the traditional qawwal of the dargah. The dargah has also been featured in movies like Bajrangi Bhaijaan featuring Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor, and in \\"Aawan Akhiyan Jawan Akhiyan\\" a qawwali in the 2006 film Ahista Ahista featuring Soha Ali Khan and Abhay Deol. Management The dargah is a property that belongs to the Delhi Waqf Board. Offerings are collected under the baridari system through pirzadas, who are the custodians of the Sufi dargahs. This usually comprises of descendants of those buried at the dargah. The committee, Anjuman Peerzadan Nizamiyan Khusravi, looks after the dargah.

Casual games may exhibit any type of gameplay and genre. They generally have simpler rules, shorter sessions, and less learned skill than hardcore games. Countless casual games have been developed and published, alongside hardcore games, across the history of video games. A concerted effort to capitalize on casual games grew in the 1990s and 2000s, as many developers and publishers branded themselves as casual game companies, publishing games especially for personal computers, web browsers, and, after 2007, smartphones. Overview Most casual games have: *Fun, simple gameplay that is easy to understand *Simple user interface, operated with a mobile phone tap-and-swipe interface or a one-button mouse interface *Short sessions, so a game can be played during work breaks, while on public transportation, or while waiting in a queue anywhere *Often, familiar visual elements, like playing cards or a Match 3 grid of objects Casual games generally cost less than hardcore games, as part of their strategy to acquire as many players as possible. Any game monetization method can be used, from retail distribution to free-to-play to ad-supported. The term \\"hyper-casual game\\" or \\"instant game\\" arose in 2017 to describe extremely easy-to-learn games that require no download, being played in an existing app like a web browser or messaging app, and that usually monetize by showing advertisements to the player. History Journalist Chris Kohler wrote in 2010 that Namco's arcade game Pac-Man (1980), which debuted during the golden age of video arcade games, may be the first casual video game, due to its \\"cute cast of characters and a design sensibility that appealed to wider audiences than the shoot-em-up Space Invaders.\\" It is estimated to have been played more than ten billion times during the 20th century, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time. In 1989, Nintendo's Game Boy was released with Tetris as a free pack-in game. It was quickly learned and immensely popular, and is credited with making Nintendo's fledgling portable gaming system a success. Microsoft's Solitaire (1990), which came free with Microsoft Windows, is widely considered the first hit \\"casual game\\" on a computer, with more than 400 million people having played the game . Subsequent versions of Windows included casual games Minesweeper, FreeCell, and Spider Solitaire. The company published four Microsoft Entertainment Packs for casual gaming on office computers from 1990 to 1992. Casual games started to flourish online in the 1990s along with the rise of the World Wide Web, with card games and board games available from paid services like AOL and Prodigy, and then from web portals, like Yahoo! Games and Microsoft's Gaming Zone. In the mid-2000s, more sites specialized in game hosting and publishing, such as Gamesville and RealNetworks. Some publishers and developers branded themselves specifically as casual game companies, like Big Fish Games, PopCap Games, and MumboJumbo. The advent of Shockwave and Flash created a boom in web-based games, encouraging designers to create simple games that could be hosted on many different websites and which could be played to completion in one short sitting. One of the most prominent casual games, Bejeweled, started out as a Flash game that could be downloaded for a fee, or purchased at retail. As late as 2009, there was still a market for US$20 casual games purchased at retail or as a download. In 2008 and 2009, casual social network games rapidly attained mainstream popularity following the release of Mafia Wars for Facebook, and Happy Farm in China. Happy Farm inspired many clones, including the most popular social network game, FarmVille (2009), which peaked at 83.76 million monthly active users in March, 2010. These games innovated in viral marketing by rewarding players for sending invites to friends and posting game updates on their Facebook Wall. Casual games became popular on smartphones immediately upon their debut, with touch-screen phones like the iPhone of 2007 featuring large color displays, all-day availability to the phone owner, and intuitive tapping-and-dragging user interfaces. Video game consoles' primary audience is hardcore gamers, but there are some casual games on every game console, and Nintendo's Wii console's unique motion-sensing controller appealed to a more casual audience that was perhaps intimidated by other consoles' gamepad input devices. Wii Sports (2006), a collection of five simple sports games in which players used the game controller to swing a tennis racket or a baseball bat, was bundled with the Wii console in most territories and sold over 82 million copies as of 2019.  Genres  Casual games are found in many game genres. Early-2000s categorizations by Big Fish Games and Gamezebo, a casual game review site named seven popular genres in casual games: * Puzzle games: Bejeweled series, Collapse! series, Luxor series * Hidden object games: Mystery Case Files series, Mortimer Beckett series, Hidden Expedition series * Adventure games: Dream Chronicles series, Aveyond series, Nancy Drew series * Strategy games (including time management): Diner Dash series, Delicious series, Cake Mania series * Arcade & action games: Plants vs. Zombies, Peggle series, Feeding Frenzy series * Word & trivia games: Bookworm, Bookworm Adventures series, Bonnie's Bookstore * Card & board games: Slingo Quest, Lottso! Deluxe, Luxor Mahjong  Casual Games Association  An industry group called the Casual Games Association was founded in 2005 to promote casual games and to provide educational, networking, and market research resources to casual game developers and publishers. It published a print magazine and hosted annual conferences called \\"Casual Connect\\" in Seattle, Kiev, Amsterdam and London with what it said were \\"upwards of 7,000 professional attendees each year\\". In 2018, the show was sold to media company Greenlit Content, who then rebranded the show \\"GameDaily Connect\\".

Released in 2002, it was best known for its ability to drive three monitors (\\"Surround Gaming\\") and its Coral Reef tech demo. As had happened with previous Matrox products, the Parhelia was released just before competing companies released cards that completely outperformed it. In this case it was the ATI Radeon 9700, released only a few months later. The Parhelia remained a niche product, and was Matrox's last major effort to sell into the consumer market. Background The Parhelia series was Matrox's attempt to return to the market after a long hiatus, their first significant effort since the G200 and G400 lines had become uncompetitive. Their other post-G400 products, G450 and G550, were cost-reduced revisions of G400 technology and were not competitive with ATI's Radeon or NVIDIA's GeForce lines with regards to 3D computer graphics. Description =Features= The Parhelia-512 was the first GPU by Matrox to be equipped with a 256-bit memory bus, giving it an advantage over other cards of the time in the area of memory bandwidth. The \\"-512\\" suffix refers to the 512-bit ring bus. The Parhelia processor featured Glyph acceleration, where anti-aliasing of text was accelerated by the hardware. Parhelia-512 includes 4 32√ó4 vertex shaders with dedicated displacement mapping engine, pixel shader array with 4 texturing unit and 5-stage pixel shader per pixel pipeline. It supports 16√ó fragment anti- aliasing, all of which were featured prominently in Matrox's Coral Reef technical demo. Display controller component supports 10-bit color frame buffer (called \\"Gigacolor\\") with 10-bit 400 MHz RAMDACs on 2 RGB ports and 230 MHz RAMDAC on TV encoder port, which was an improvement over its competitors. The frame buffer is in RGBA (10:10:10:2) format, and supports full gamma correction. Dual link TMDS is supported via external controller connected to the digital interface. Memory controller supports 256-bit DDR SDRAM. The \\"Surround Gaming\\" support allowed the card to drive three monitors creating a unique level gaming immersion. For example, in a flight simulator or sim racing, the middle monitor could show the windshield while the left and right monitors could display the side views (offering peripheral vision). However, only 2 displays can be controlled independently.Matrox's Comeback Kid - The Parhelia-512 =Video cards= The cards were released in 2002, simply called Matrox Parhelia, initially came with 128 or 256 MiB memory. Retail cards are clocked 220 MHz core, 275 MHz memory; OEM cards are clocked 200 MHz core, 250 MHz memory.Matrox's Parhelia - A Performance Paradox To further improve analog image quality, 5th order low-pass filters are used. =Performance= Parhelia chip For a top-of-the-line, and rather expensive card ($399 USD), the Matrox Parhelia's 3D gaming performance was well behind NVIDIA's older and similarly priced GeForce 4 Ti 4600. The Parhelia was only competitive with the older Radeon 8500 and GeForce 3, which typically cost half as much. The Parhelia's potent performance was held back by its comparatively low GPU clock speed (220 MHz for retail model, 200 MHz for OEM and 256 MB models), initially believed by many commentators to be due to the large (for that time-frame) transistor total. However, ATI's Radeon 9700 was released later that year, with a considerably larger transistor count (108 million vs. 80 million), on the same 150 nm chip fabrication process, yet managed a substantially higher clock (325 MHz vs. 250 MHz). The card's fillrate performance was formidable in games that used many texture layers; though equipped with just 4 pixel pipelines, each had 4 texture units. This, unfortunately, proved not to be an efficient arrangement in most situations. Parhelia was also hampered by poor bandwidth conserving technologies/techniques; ATI introduced their 3rd gen HyperZ in Radeon 9700, NVIDIA touted Lightning Memory Architecture 2 for the GeForce 4 series, Matrox had no similarly comprehensive optimization approach. While the Parhelia possessed an impressive raw memory bandwidth much of it was wasted on invisible house-keeping tasks because the card lacked the ability to predict overdraw or compress z-buffer data, among other inefficiencies. Some writers believed Parhelia to have a \\"crippled\\" triangle-setup engine that starved the rest of the chip in typical 3D rendering tasks . Later in Parhelia's life, when DirectX 9 applications were becoming quite prevalent, Matrox acknowledged that the vertex shaders were not Shader Model 2.0 capable, and as such not DirectX 9-compliant, as was initially advertised. Presumably there were several bugs within the Parhelia core that could not be worked around in the drivers. However, it was all a bit of a moot point because Parhelia's performance was not adequate to drive most DirectX 9-supporting titles well even without more complex shader code weighing the card down. =Sales= Despite the lackluster performance for its price, Matrox hoped to win over enthusiasts with the Parhelia's unique and high quality features, such as \\"Surround Gaming\\", glyph acceleration, high resolutions, and 16x fragment anti-aliasing. In these aspects, some reviewers suggested that Parhelia could have been a compelling alternative to the comparably priced GeForce 4 Ti 4600 ($399 USD), which was the performance leader but only DirectX 8.1 compliant. However, within a few months after release, the Parhelia was completely overshadowed by ATI's far faster and fully DirectX 9.0 compliant Radeon 9700. The Radeon 9700 was faster and produced higher quality 3D images, while debuting at the same price as the Parhelia ($399 USD). Due to their equivalent pricing against faster cards, the Parhelia never got a significant hold in the market. It remained a niche product, while nVidia and ATI control the majority of the discrete graphics chip market. Parhelia-LX After the launch of Parhelia-512, Matrox released Parhelia-LX, which supports only 128-bit memory and has only 2 pixel pipelines. The first video cards using it included Matrox Millennium P650 and Millennium P750. Future products Originally, Matrox planned to produce the \\"Parhelia 2\\" successor, codenamed \\"Pitou\\".Parhelia II Codename \\"Pitou\\" However, when Parhelia-512 failed to compete in the gaming market, the project was never again mentioned and Matrox left the gaming market altogether by 2003. Parhelia processors were later upgraded to support AGP 8√ó, and PCI Express. In 2006, Matrox re-introduced Surround Gaming with their TripleHead2Go, which utilizing the existing GPU to render 3D graphics, splitting the resulting image over three screens.Matrox brings triple displays to gaming with TripleHead2GoNew Matrox TripleHead2Go external upgrade offers support for 3 monitors at a time Certified products include ATI and NVIDIA (and later Intel) processors.

The company sells its merchandise through its retail stores, catalog, and online. As of August 2018, the company operated a total of 70 galleries, 18 full-line design galleries, and 6 baby & child galleries. The company also has 36 outlet stores in the United States and Canada. History Stephen Gordon, founder of Restoration Hardware at the original Eureka, CA headquarters in 1981. Stephen Gordon founded Restoration Hardware in Eureka, California in 1979 while restoring a Victorian home and finding affordable, high-quality hardware and fixtures unavailable. Mr. Gordon honed his merchandising skills for ten years expanding slowly in Northern California and Boston before raising outside capital from Cardinal Investments allowing accelerated expansion. The company had 47 stores when it went public in 1998, ending the year at over 65 stores and commencing a rapid expansion to over 100 stores in 31 states reaching $369.5 million in net sales by 2001. Museum of Natural History building, Boston Gary Friedman joined the company from Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 2001 as Chief Executive Officer after being passed over for the CEO position at Williams-Sonoma by Howard Lester when Restoration Hardware's sales were waning and the company was seeking additional capital. In 2005, Gordon left the company in order to take over as CEO of Robert Redford's Sundance Catalog Company. In 2007, Sears Holdings Corporation announced the purchase of a 13.7% share of Restoration Hardware, prompting speculation that Sears Holdings might attempt a full takeover. After the bursting of the United States housing bubble, the company was slated to close two stores in 2008, including the original store located in the heart of Old Town Eureka, and open one in Canada. In June 2008, the company completed the transaction without Sears Holding, but instead with Catterton Partners. As of June 18, 2008, the company was no longer publicly traded. That year, the company also launched its baby & child line. In 2012, Restoration Hardware underwent an initial public offering trading at $24 a share at its opening. RH's common stock now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RH. Upon this move the company renamed itself RH, removing the rest of the company name's letters from its official nomenclature. About 65% of the company's products come from overseas, particularly from contract manufacturers in southern China. The company is also the largest importer of Belgian Linen and Italian bedding in the United States. RH created a small spaces line in 2012, composed of furnishings scaled down for smaller living spaces. The 2014 Small Spaces source book depicts 18 different smaller-scale homes in the United States and Europe. In 2013, RH also released the Objects of Curiosity source book, showing character pieces, artifacts, and unique d√©cor. The tableware line was released in 2013. In 2012, the company also encountered some accusations of copying the designs of other companies, specifically those used for the US military. On March 7, 2013, Restoration Hardware opened a gallery in Boston's Back Bay in an 1864 brick and brownstone structure at 234 Berkeley Street. In May 2013, the company announced a multichannel RH contemporary art platform when it acquired the first edition of Rain Room by Random International with exclusive showing rights in North America. RH loaned Rain Room to the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the U.S. premier of EXPO 1: New York from mid-May through July 2013. In 2014, RH opened a 70,000 square foot store which Atlanta Magazine called RH's \\"next-generation full-line design gallery\\", which includes amenities like a 50-foot infinite pool. RH operates six stores in Canada: one full line design gallery at Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, three galleries and two outlets. Source books Time magazine was critical of the company for its large catalog called the \\"Source Book\\" for its length (992 pages), specifically its waste of paper. The full 2014 catalogue weighed 17 lbs and had over 3000 pages. The company stated that by combining all of the different sourcebooks into one package it reduced their carbon footprint, while critics still stated that the volume of paper used for the publication's mass delivery was wasteful. Design philosophy Las Vegas As of September 2010, company representatives declared a change in focus for the company. In an attempt to go further \\"up-market\\", the company has focused itself on furniture gallery offerings at higher price points to distinguish itself from competitors like Pottery Barn. Locations have begun adding the term \\"Gallery\\" to their marques to indicate the change. The company designs, markets, and sells its collections through its retail stores, source books, and online. The San Francisco Chronicle has reported that, \\"One of the key strategies that set RH apart is its approach to inventory. While most retailers design things in- house, RH created a different model. \\"We have one full-time designer, Suzi Bolognese, working directly from London on our catalogs and displays\\" [its CEO] Friedman said. \\"We find artists we love and 'curate' [the client].\\"\\" The company has partnered with artisans and designers in the production of its lines. Jim Cramer of CNBC stated that source books were a tactic to move past the \\"four walls of the web\\" and to make it \\"exciting for people to shop again\\". He also stated that RH is a market disruptor, often to the point that it \\"disrupts itself\\". In a different piece, Cramer stated that the company was reinventing the concept of the brick and mortar store, including the use of very large flagship stores in unusual locations. Executives Gary Friedman was the company's chairman and co-chief executive officer from 2001 until his resignation in 2012 following an independent report from Weil, Gotshal & Manges into his inappropriate romantic relationship with a younger female employee. Following his dismissal, Friedman continued the relationship with the woman. He was reappointed as co-CEO and chairman in July 2013.Sorkin, Andrew Ross (August 16, 2012). \\"Restoration Hardware Co-Chief Steps Down After an Inquiry\\". DealBook (blog of The New York Times). Retrieved August 16, 2012. The company also announced that concurrent with Friedman's appointment, RH acquired the exclusive right to develop Hierarchy and that the new concept would be rebranded as RH Atelier, focusing on the development of luxury apparel, accessories, footwear, and jewelry. Carlos Alberini joined as co-CEO in 2010, but resigned in 2013 to accept a position as CEO of Lucky Brand Jeans, upon which Friedman became the Chairman and CEO of the company.

According to Christian tradition, this occurred at Chalcedon. According to tradition, Euphemia was arrested for refusing to offer sacrifices to Ares. After suffering various tortures, she died in the arena at Chalcedon from a wound sustained from a bear. Her tomb became a site of pilgrimages. She is commemorated on September 16. Historical background Euphemia's name and year of death are recorded in the 5th century Martyrologium Hieronymianum, the earliest extant list of Christian martyrs. The year, 303, was the first year of the Great Persecution under Roman emperor Diocletian. The Fasti vindobonenses, a collection of liturgical documents from the 4th to 6th centuries, says she died on the 16th of October. Other than this, there is no verifiable historical information about Euphemia. Egeria, who made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land about 381-384 and wrote an account of her travels, relates being shown the site of Euphemia's martyrdom in Chalcedon. Euphemia became a famous saint and stories about her accumulated; the Golden Legend, a collection of hagiographies from about 1260, includes an account of her martyrdom. Hagiography Saint Euphemia, Andrea Mantegna, tempera on canvas, 1454 St. Euphemia lived on the cusp of the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. According to tradition, she was the daughter of a senator named Philophronos and his wife Theodosia in Chalcedon, located across the Bosporus from the city of Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul).\\"St. Euphemia the All-Praised\\", Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese From her youth she was consecrated to virginity. The governor of Chalcedon, Priscus, had made a decree that all of the inhabitants of the city take part in sacrifices to the deity Ares. Euphemia was discovered with forty-nine other Christians hiding in a house and worshipping God, in defiance of the governor's orders. Because of their refusal to sacrifice, they were tortured for a number of days, and then, all but Euphemia, sent to the Emperor for trial.\\"Greatmartyr Euphemia the All- praised\\", Orthodox Church in America Euphemia, the youngest among them, was separated from her companions and subjected to particularly harsh torments, including the wheel, in hopes of breaking her spirit. She was placed in the arena, where lions were sent out to kill her, but they instead licked her wounds. It is believed that she died of wounds from a wild bear in the arena. Miracle during the Council of Chalcedon The Council of Chalcedon, the Fourth Ecumenical Council of the Christian Church, took place in the city of Chalcedon in the year 451. It repudiated the Eutychian doctrine of monophysitism, and set forth the Chalcedonian Definition, which describes the \\"full humanity and full divinity\\" of Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity. Present at the council were 630 representatives from all the local Christian Churches. The meetings were quite contentious, and no decisive consensus could be reached. According to the Synaxarion of Constantinople, a collection of hagiographies, both parties wrote a confession of their faith and placed them on the breast of Saint Euphemia within her tomb. After three days the tomb was opened and the scroll with the Orthodox confession was seen in the right hand of St Euphemia while the scroll of the Monophysites lay at her feet. Relics Sarcophagus containing some of the relics of Saint Euphemia in Rovinj, Croatia. When the persecution of Diocletian ended, the Christians laid Saint Euphemia‚Äôs reputed relics in a golden sarcophagus, placed within a church that was dedicated to her. Her relics attracted crowds of pilgrims for centuries. Church of St. George in Istanbul. Around the year 620, in the wake of the conquest of Chalcedon by the Persians under Khosrau I in the year 617, the relics of Saint Euphemia were transferred to a new church in Constantinople. There, during the persecutions of the Iconoclasts, her reliquary was said to have been thrown into the sea, from which it was recovered by the ship-owning brothers Sergios and Sergonos, who belonged to the Orthodox party, and who gave it over to the local bishop who hid them in a secret crypt. The relics were afterwards taken to the Island of Lemnos, and in 796 they were returned to Constantinople. The majority of her relics are still in the Patriarchal Church of St. George, in Istanbul. Feast days The primary feast day of Saint Euphemia, celebrated by both Eastern and Western Christians is September 16 in commemoration of her martyrdom. Additionally, Eastern Orthodox Christians commemorate her miracle at the Council of Chalcedon on July 11. Popular culture St. Euphemia is a widely venerated saint among all Eastern Orthodox Christians, not only for her virginity and martyrdom, but also for her strengthening of the Orthodox Faith, and her feast days are celebrated with special solemnity. Churches in her honor have been erected at many places in the Christian world.

It is situated on the River Camlin, and falls within the civil parish of Clonbroney. The village name in Irish means \\"mouth of the ford of the calves\\". The name \\"St Johnstown\\" came from the name of the Church of Ireland Church of St. John. There are two Roman Catholic churches in the parish; the Church of the Holy Trinity in the village and the Church of St James in Clonbroney. Ballinalee was the site of the first convent in Ireland at Old Clonbroney. Its remains are still to be seen. The parochial hall on the Granard road, was opened in 1939 and is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Ashe, the Irish patriot. The local national school is adjacent to the hall and is named after Saint Samhthann. History The St Johnstown borough constituency in the Irish House of Commons was nominally representative of the town. In 1833, the Commissioners appointed by the UK Parliament to inquire into municipal corporations in Ireland reported that the corporation of the borough was \\"virtually extinct\\". The 1846 Parliamentary Gazetteer records: Antoine √ì Raifteiri's poem \\"The Lass From Bally-na-Lee\\" references the town. In 1798, the town was the scene of a massacre of Irish prisoners of war after the Battle of Ballinamuck in a field now called Bully's Acre. During the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1921), the town was the scene of the Battle of Ballinalee, where local leader Sean Mac Eoin (sometimes known as the Blacksmith of Ballinalee) was the leader of a well-equipped battalion of 300 men. They held off 900 members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and British Army for three days. It was the only successful defence of an Irish town against the British forces. Within the parish is the ruins of Old Clonbroney; it was reportedly the home of the first convent in Ireland, which was founded by St Patrick around 440 AD. There are two lakes in the parish. Corbeagh lake, or Currygrane Lough, is situated in the middle of the parish and is located within the townlands of Drumeel Corbeagh and Currygrane. It has four small islands on it and one, called \\"Round Island,\\" is thought to be a Crannog or ancient settlement. The other lake is called Gurteen and is situated near the village and adjacent to the Maguire Park. Henry Hughes Wilson was born in the area in 1864, and would become the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff before his assassination by Irish Republicans. He was born in Currygrane near the village.

Unlike most types of flogging, this punishment was meant more to be painful than to cause actual injury to the victim. Blows were generally delivered with a light rod, knotted cord, or lash.https://www.britannica.com/topic/flogging#ref177595 The receiving person is required to be barefoot. The uncovered soles of the feet need to be placed in an exposed position. The beating is typically performed with an object like a cane or switch. The strokes are usually aimed at the arches of the feet and repeated over a certain number of times. Bastinado is also referred to as foot (bottom) caning or sole caning, depending on the instrument in use. The particular Middle East method is called falaka or falanga,Cfr. Wolfgang Schweickard, Turkisms in Italian, French and German (Ottoman Period, 1300-1900). A historical and etymological dictionary s.v. falaka derived from the Greek term phalanx. The German term is Bastonade, deriving from the Italian noun bastonata (stroke with the use of a stick). In former times it was also referred to as Sohlenstreich (corr. striking the soles). The Chinese term is d«é ji«éoxƒ´n (ÊâìËÑöÂøÉ / ÊâìËÖ≥ÂøÉ). Overview The first written documentation of bastinado in Europe dates to the year 1537, in China to 960. References to bastinado have been hypothesised to be found in the Bible (Prov. 22:15; Lev. 19:20; Deut. 22:18), suggesting the practice since antiquity. This subform of flagellation differentiates from most other forms by limiting the strokes to a very narrow section of the body. The beatings typically aim at the vaults of the feet where the soles are particularly pain sensitive, usually avoiding hitting the balls and heels directly but concentrating on the small area in between. As the skin texture under the soles of the feet can naturally endure high levels of strain, injuries demanding medical attention, such as lacerations or bruises, are rarely inflicted if certain precautions are observed by the executant. The undersides of the feet have therefore become a common target for corporal punishment in many cultures while basically different methods exist. Foot whipping is typically carried out within prisons and similar institutions. Besides inflicting intense physical suffering, it trades on the significance of bare feet as a dishonouring socio-cultural attribute; consequently it is regarded as a particularly humiliating as well as degrading form of punishment. Because wearing shoes is an integral element of societal appearance since antiquity, the visual exposure of bare feet is a traditional and sometimes even ritualistic practice to display the subjection or submission of a person under a manifestation of superior power. It was often used as a visual indicator of subservient standing within a social structure and to display the imbalance in power, and was therefore routinely imposed as a visual identifier on slaves and prisoners who had often been divested of rights and liberties in a similar manner. Exploiting its socio- cultural significance, people have been forced to go barefoot as a formal shame sanction and for public humiliation as well. Keeping prisoners barefoot is common practice in several countries of today. Foot whipping therefore poses a distinct threat and is often particularly dreaded by potential victims (usually prisoners). Exploiting these effects, prisons typically used this penalty to maintain discipline and compliance.Arnold, Eysenck, Meili: Lexikon der Psychologie (Encyclopedia of Psychology), Band 3, 1973, S. 476f, Bastinado is commonly associated with Middle and Far Eastern nations, where it is occasionally performed in public, and thus documented by occasional reports and photographs. However it has been frequently practised in the Western World as well, particularly in prisons, reformatories, boarding schools and similar institutions. In Europe bastinado was a frequently encountered form of corporal punishment particularly in German areas, where it was mainly carried out to enforce discipline within penal and reformatory institutions, culminating during the Third Reich era. In several German and Austrian institutions it was still practised during the 1950s.\\"krone.at\\" vom 29. M√§rz 2012 Berichte √ºber Folter im Kinderheim auf der Hohen Warte; 3 March 2014Ruxandra Cesereanu: An Overview of Political Torture in the Twentieth Century. p. 124f. Although bastinado was practised in penal institutions of the Western world until the late 20th century, it was barely noticed as there is no reference to its ever being adjudged on a high level. Instead, it was carried out on a rather low level within the confines of the institutions, typically to punish inmates during incarceration. If not specifically authorized, the practice was usually condoned, while happening unbeknownst to the public. Also, foot whipping rarely attracts public interest in general, as it appears unspectacular and relatively inoffensive compared to other punishment methods. Because it was not carried out publicly in the western world, it was usually witnessed only by those individuals directly involved. Given that bastinado is widely perceived as a degrading punishment and a public humiliation, former prisoners rarely report incidents, while the perpetrators are usually obliged to confidentiality. Bastinado is still used as prison punishment in several countries. Since it causes a high level of suffering for the victim and physical evidence remains largely undetectable for some time, it is frequently used in interrogation and torture.  Appearance  Bastinado usually requires a certain amount of collaborative effort and an authoritarian presence on the executing party to be enforced. Therefore, it typically appears in settings where corporal punishment is officially approved to be exerted on predefined group of people. This can be situations of imprisonment and incarceration as well as slavery. This moderated subform of flagellation is characteristically prevalent where subjected individuals are forced to remain barefoot. = Regional = Foot whipping was common practice as means of disciplinary punishment in different kinds of institutions throughout Central Europe until the 1950s, especially in German territories. In German prisons this method consistently served as the principal disciplinary punishment. Throughout the Nazi era it was frequently used in German penal institutions and labour camps. It was also inflicted on the population in occupied territories, notably Denmark and Norway. During the era of slavery in Brazil and the American South it was often used whenever so-called \\"clean beating\\" instead of the prevalent more radical forms of flagellation was demanded. This was the case when a loss in market value through visible injuries especially on females was to be avoided. As many so-called \\"slave-codes\\" included a barefoot constraint, bastinado required minimal effort to be performed. As it was sufficiently effective but usually left no visible or relevant injuries, bastinado was often used as an alternative for female slaves with higher market value. Bastinado is still practised in penal institutions of several countries around the world. In a 1967 survey 83% of the inmates in Greek prisons reported about frequent infliction of bastinado. It was also used against rioting students. In Spanish prisons 39% of the inmates reported about this kind of treatment. The French S√ªret√© reportedly used it to extract confessions.

Methods  Middle Eastern falaka using a plank; Iran, early 20th century The prisoner is barefooted and restrained in such manner that the feet cannot be shifted out of position. The intention is to avert serious injuries of the forefoot by stray hitting, especially of the fracturable toes. The energy of the stroke impacts is typically meant to be absorbed by the muscular tissue inside the vaults of the feet. In the Middle Eastern falaka method, the victim is forced to lie on his or her back while the feet are elevated and bound. The beating is generally performed with a rigid wooden stick, a club or a truncheon. The term falaka describes the wooden plank used to tie up the ankles; however, different items are used for this purpose. This approach is very painful to the bare ankles. The Middle Eastern falaka method can cause more serious injuries, such as bone fractures and nerve damage, than the German method, since the person undergoing falaka can, to a certain degree, move their body and feet; as a result, strokes land more or less randomly and injury-prone areas are frequently affected. As falaka is usually carried out with a rigid and often heavy stick, it accordingly causes blunt trauma leaving the person unable to walk and often impeded for life. In the German method, the prisoner was principally unable to move and the beatings were performed with more lightweight objects, thinner in diameter and usually slightly flexible. The physical aftereffects of the procedure were mostly superficial and unwanted injuries were relatively rare. Therefore, the person usually was able to walk immediately following punishment. Nonetheless, the German form of bastinado caused severe levels of pain and suffering for the receiving person. An alternative form of the torture is inflicted in Saudi Arabia as a penalty for, among other offenses, selling alcohol to Muslims. After the naked feet are immobilized, their soles are repeatedly struck with a heavy leather bullwhip. The whip is wielded by an expert who can cause the tip to crack so that bleeding wounds are inflicted and the feet are paralyzed with agony. Twenty to fifty lashes on the naked soles is a typical duration for the torture.  Effects  The beatings usually aim at the tender longitudinal arch of the foot avoiding the bone structure of the ball and the heel. The vaults are particularly touch-sensitive and therefore susceptible to pain due to the tight clustering of nerve endings. = Corporal = Visible welts typically sustained after bastinado using a thin rod for beating When exerted with a thin and flexible object of lighter weight the corporal effects usually remain temporary. The numerous bones and tendons of the foot are sufficiently protected by muscular tissue so the impact is absorbed by the skin and muscular tissue. The skin under the soles of the human feet is of high elasticity and consistence similar to the palms of the hands.Lederhaut in ‚ÄûMedizInfo‚Äú about the dermis; 20 January 2014 Lesions and hematoma therefore rarely occur while beating marks are mostly superficial. Depending on the characteristics of the beating device in use and the intensity of the beatings the emerging visible aftereffects remain ascertainable over a time frame of a few hours to several days. The receiving person usually remains able to walk without help right after the punishment. When the beating is executed with heavy sticks like clubs or truncheons according to the falaka method, bone fractures commonly occur as well as nerve damage and severe hematoma. The sustained injuries can take a long time to heal with even lasting or irreversible physical damage to the human musculoskeletal system. When thin and flexible instruments are used the immediate experience of pain is described as acutely stinging and searing. The instant sensations are disproportionally intense compared to the applied force and reflexively radiate through the body. The subsequent pain sensations of a succession of strokes are often described as throbbing, piercing or burning and gradually ease off within a few hours. A slightly stinging or nagging sensation often remains perceptible for a couple of days, especially while walking. As the nerve endings under the soles of the feet do not adapt to recurring sensations or impacts, the pain reception does not alleviate through continuous beatings. On the contrary the perception of pain is further intensified over the course of additional impacts through the activation of nociceptors. Over a sequence of impacts applied with nearly constant force the perception of pain is therefore progressively intensifying until a maximum level of activation is reached. For that reason a relatively gentle impact can cause an acute pain sensation after a certain number of preceding strokes. The subjective experience of corporal suffering can however largely diverge according to a person's individual pain tolerance. The pain reception itself is hereby aggravated through feelings of anxiety and agitation. The subjective pain susceptibility is accordingly higher the more apprehensive the individual feels about it.Schmerzrezeptoren in ‚ÄûMedizInfo‚Äú about pain receptors; 20 January 2013.Schmerz und Angst in ‚ÄûPraxisklinik Dr. med. Thomas Weiss‚Äú about intensification of pain through anxiety; 20 January 2014. = Mental = Seizing and withholding the footwear from a person in a situation of imprisonment, which is commonplace in many countries, often has a disconsolating and victimizing effect on the individual. As bare feet are traditionally regarded as a token of subjection and captivity, the unaccustomed and largely reluctant exposure is often perceived as humiliating or oppressive. The increased physical vulnerability by having to remain barefoot often leads to trepidation and the feeling of insecurity. This measure alone can therefore already cause significant distress. This circumstance is usually aggravated if the bare feet are the target for corporal punishment. The feet are typically hidden away and protected by footwear in most social situations, hereby avoiding unwanted exposure. Therefore, the enforced exposure for the purpose of punishment is mostly perceived as a form of harassment. The obligatory restraints further add to the anxiety and humiliation of the captive. Any form of methodical corporal punishment typically causes a high level of distress through the inflicted pain and the experience of being defenseless and unable to evade the situation. The mostly occurring loss of composure during the punishment as well as the experience of weakness and vulnerability often permanently damages a person's self-esteem. Beating the undersides of a person's feet moreover conveys an especially steep imbalance in power between the executing party (prison staff or similar) towards the receiving individual (typically prison inmate). A rather private area of the body, which traditionally remains covered or not visible in the presence of other people, is forcibly exposed and beaten. This act represents a blunt intrusion into the sphere of personal privacy and an according elimination of personal boundaries. By this means the receiving person experiences his or her individual powerlessness against the executing authority in a particularly manifest way. This experience can also change or deconstruct the individual's self-perception and self-awareness. As a result, the experience of bastinado leads to drastic physical and mental suffering for the receiving individual and is therefore regarded as a highly effectual method of corporal punishment. Exploiting the effects of bastinado on a person, it is still frequently employed on prisoners in several countries.

In 2005 he left that position, later accusing top ministers of large-scale fraud. In the anglo-leasing corruption which he blew the lid over, fraudulent deliveries of government military and forensic laboratory equipment were allegedly ordered, \\"delivered\\" and the payment completed in the current president- Uhuru Kenyatta's tenure. The story of his fight against corruption is told in Michela Wrong's book It's Our Turn to Eat: The Story of a Kenyan Whistle-Blower.Wrong, Michaela (2009).

His father Joe Githongo owned an accounting firm, President Jomo Kenyatta being one of its clients.The EastAfrican, 14 February 2009: 'Traitor' who stayed true to Kenya John Githongo went to the prestigious St. Mary's School in Nairobi. He studied Economics and Philosophy at the University of Wales before returning to his native Kenya. He briefly worked as a management consultant and researcher before moving into journalism.Profile of John Githongo at World Economic Forum In this role he wrote extensively for the Nairobi-based EastAfrican and Executive magazine, attacking corruption throughout Kenyan society under the Moi regime. He was also a correspondent for the British journal The Economist and wrote for a range of local and international papers as well. In the 1990s he received the CNN African Journalist of the year award (third prize). Transparency International Following in his father's footsteps he joined the Transparency International movement. He founded and served as founder- Executive Director of the Kenyan chapter of Transparency International in 1999 after years of the government refusing it registration. He also served a board member of Transparency International in Berlin. SAREAT In 1998, political scientist Mutahi Ngunyi's NGO ‚Äì Series for Alternative Research in East Africa (SAREAT) funded by the Ford Foundation, engaged Githongo to edit a regional political economy magazine, East African Alternatives. The magazine folded after operating four issues. This was as a result of audit queries made by Price Waterhouse, and subsequent commercial court action brought against Mr. Ngunyi by the Ford Foundation with Mr. Githongo as a witness on behalf of the prosecution having revealed to Ford the initial problems that led to the audit in the first place. A case was instituted against SAREAT trustees by its donors but was apparently later withdrawn after SAREAT agreed to repay the funds under contention. Anglo Leasing In January 2003 he was appointed to the position of Permanent Secretary for Governance and Ethics by the incoming president Kibaki, who had been elected on an anti-corruption platform. He resigned from his position on 7 February 2005BBC News: Kenya's anti-graft czar resigns without comment, though it was reported that he felt the government lacked commitment to ending corruption and that he had received death threats, a common occurrence in Kenyan public office holding.BBC News: Kenya graft fighter 'threatened' As a result of his resignation international aid to Kenya was cut. He remains a powerful advocate against corruption. On 22 January 2006, Githongo named vice-president MOODY AWORI as one of four top politicians (with KIRAITU MURUNGI, former justice minister and present energy minister; finance minister DAVID MWIRARIA and former transport minister CHRIS MURUNGARU) as being involved in scams worth $600M ‚Äì known as the Anglo Leasing Scandal. He also claimed that President Kibaki was complicit in the affair. The scandal centered on the award of a huge contract given to Anglo-Leasing ‚Äì a company that did not exist. Githongo claimed that the money raised would have funded the government's forthcoming election campaign. These allegations were denied by Awori and Murungaru and an investigation was promised.BBC News: Graft claims rock Kenyan cabinet Exile Githongo moved to the UK to live in exile after claiming that there have been threats to his life. In a secret cable by the US ambassador in Kenya to Washington dated the 16/9/09, released by Wikileaks, made clear the extent of these threats. In one section the ambassador wrote ‚Äì \\"Paragraph 5 provides details of statements made by Ringera (former head of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission) to Githongo that Githongo took as direct threats to his life by the Kenyan political elite, to include Ringera. This TD corroborates Githongo's conclusion about Ringera who is identified in a room with leading Kikuyu politicians, including Ministers of government, plotting to kill Githongo in 2009. The conclusion one can draw from this report, combined with Githongo's testimony, is that Ringera is part of those within the Kenyan political elite seeking to suppress information and those with information that could assist in punishing and minimizing corruption in Kenya.\\" WikileaksBBC News: Kenya 'safe' for anti-graft czar He took up a post at an Oxford college (Senior Associate Member of St Antony's College). It has also been recently revealed that he taken up an additional position as a Visiting Fellow of the Ottawa-based International Development Research Centre. In an interview with Fergal Keane for the BBC's Newsnight programme on 8 February 2006, Githongo revealed what he claims is taped evidence proving that Kiraitu Murungi attempted to impede his inquiries.BBC News: 'Taped evidence' in Kenya scandal (includes 3.3Meg PDF of Githongo's dossier ‚Äì a blockbuster) Murungi suggested that a 30M Kenyan Shilling loan to his father by a lawyer A.H.

He reveals that at the end of his investigations, he came to the inescapable conclusion that the Anglo Leasing scandal went all the way to the top, and as a consequence his life was in danger. Anglo Leasing, and many other similar deals, were rumoured by some people to be back-door financing to pay for NARC's election bid in 2007. While in Britain, Githongo spent two days giving evidence to a delegation of Kenyan MPs who were investigating the scandal. Both parties were positive about the outcomes of the meetings.BBC News: Githongo reassured after meeting Allegations of spying Throughout the saga allegations about the sophisticated nature of the Githongo recordings and the reason and extent for the involvement of the British Embassy have been subject to rife speculation. Dr Murungaru, who was also the National Security Minister, maintains that Githongo was and still is a British spy. On 10 February 2006, Murungi issued a statement that was faxed to all Kenyan media houses questioning the intentions and motives of John Githongo, in the form of 36 questions. Minister Murungaru was demoted as a result of Mr. Githongo's allegations and rejected by his own constituents during the 2007 general election. In 2006, Murungaru was banned from all travel to the United Kingdom by the British Home Secretary as a result of his involvement in corruption. Among the questions asked was why John Githongo was recording his conversations with Government officials and asking how many other conversations he recorded including those with the president. Some who have interviewed Githongo say that in fact the President knew about and had approved of Githongo's recordings as early as February 2004. Speculation was also rife that Githongo's continued exile was directly related to the spying allegations and the fact that he broke various secrecy laws under the Official Secrets Act, that covered government officials. However, Githongo returned to Kenya in August 2008 and the government did not challenge his allegations or attempt to prosecute him under the Official Secrets Act. Post-Exile Githongo returned to Kenya in 2008, and founded an organisation called Inuka Kenya Trust, a grassroots advocacy group aimed at creating an informed citizenry. In Jan 2011, Githongo launched a new campaign, Kenya Ni Yetu (Kenya is Ours), aimed at mobilising ordinary people to speak up against corruption, impunity and injustice. Mr. Githongo was selected as one of the world‚Äôs 100 most influential Africans by the London-based New African Magazine in its June 2011 edition. He is an Advisory board member of the International Centre for Transitional Justice, NYC, Protimos, UK and a board member of the Africa Centre for Open Governance (AfriCOG), Chair of the board, Africa Institute for Governing with Integrity, Freedom House. He is a Commissioner on the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), UK. He is a board member of Kabissa, an organisation that serves the networking, information sharing and ICT peer learning needs of African Civil Society. Previously he has been awarded the African Annual Visionary Award (2009) by the African Centre for Strategic Studies/National Defence University (Washington DC), an honorary PhD (Doctor of the University), The Open University (UK) (2007) and in 2004, the German Africa Prize. On 1 October 2015 Githongo was declared a recipient of the 2015 Allard Prize for International Integrity; sharing the CAD$100,000 prize with co-recipient Rafael Marques de Morais.

Bad Imnau was incorporated on 1 August 1973 town Haigerloch. =History= The city came in 1381 with the reign Haigerloch to the Habsburgs, the fief passed it in the 15th century to the lords of Weitingen. In 1516 Imnau was sold to the Count of Zollern. Imnau had inhabitants: *1824 440, *1836 591 *1890 507 =Mineral resources= In 1700, the physician Samuel Caspar discovered small pots source in the valley of the Eyach. 1733 Prince source was exposed, which is named after Prince Joseph Friedrich von Hohenzollern. In 1905, the Apollo-source was taken in by the family Imnau Pope, which was sold to Commerce Carl Haegele in the following year. History The first documented mention of Haigerloch was in the year 1095 on the occasion of the gift of the local castle. This castle was probably located in the area around the Upper Town. By 1200 the Counts of Hohenberg appear as the local lords and build a new castle on the Schlossberg. The lower town evolved into a market town. Rudolf I, a brother-in-law of Albert II Von Hohenberg-Haigerloch, awarded the town charter to Haigerloch before 1231. In 1268 a battle was fought just outside the city between Zollern and Hohenberg. In 1291 the city was besieged by Count Eberhard I of W√ºrttemberg; in 1347 the town was besieged again. From 1356 onward the upper town and lower town were administratively separated, but were reunited when the lordship of Haigerloch was sold to Austria in 1381. The Habsburgs pawned the property on several occasions, including to the Counts of W√ºrttemberg. In 1487 rule of the city fell to the Hohenzollern. In 1567 under Christoph von Hohenzollern-Haigerloch the area around Haigerloch was an independent territory within the area of the Holy Roman Empire as Hohenzollern-Haigerloch. In this period, the present castle complex was built on the Schlossberg as the residence of the counts of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch, replacing the former high-medieval structure. In 1634 rule of the city descended to the line of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, whose residence city was the city of Haigerloch between 1737 and 1769. In the last months of World War II, Haigerloch was the location of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics, part of the German nuclear programme, which had the goal of achieving practical use of nuclear fission. According to current view the atomic bomb was not a direct objective of this work, but initially only the construction of the Haigerloch Research Reactor, which was constructed in a beer cellar beneath the palace church. Through courageous negotiations by the pastor to rescue the reactor facility it was spared from demolition by an American command on April 24, 1945, and today is the site of the Atomkeller- Museum with a replica of the reactor.

Owned by iHeartMedia, it broadcasts a contemporary hit radio format. WAEV's transmitter is located near Bloomingdale, Georgia, and shares studios with its sister stations in Garden City. History During the early- and mid-1970s, WXLM was an easy listening station. In September 1977, the station flipped to Album Rock in response to WTOC starting a highly successful overnight album rock program in 1976. Before this, Savannah had been without a rock station since WEAS-FM flipped in the early 1970s. 97.3 went by the name 97 Rock with the call sign WXLM. In 1980, the station flipped to light pop music known as WAEV (\\"Wave 97\\"). When WXLM left the air, Savannah did not have a rock station until WIXV picked up the format in 1986. The station evolved into a Hot AC station as Mix 97.3 in 1993. After several years of falling numbers and revenue in the early 2000s, the station rebranded to Clear Channel's Top 40 Kiss FM format in December 2001.

It is also called Eccleston Delph and Eccy Delph (pronounced \\"ekky\\"). It is an old stone quarry that flooded. It is a popular site for scuba diving. Visibility is generally very poor and ropes have been strung between each underwater 'feature' to aid navigation, since traditional compass methods are all but impossible in the murky waters. Much work has been undertaken to improve visibility in the recent past, and by 2010 the visibility was much improved.  History  Formerly a Mr. Hurst ran it as a stone quarry and employed 12 men. From it came stone for Blackpool Promenade, and thin split stone used as slates for roofing in the area. It was formerly also called Hurst House Delph and Marsden's Quarry. A local resident said that \\"during World War II a Ministry paid a local man to run at intervals a pump to keep the quarry empty while its owner and staff were away. After the war due to official reorganization they stopped paying the local man, who therefore stopped running the pump, and over time the quarry flooded.\\" After it was abandoned and allowed to flood by ground water seeping in, it was an unofficial scuba diving site for a long time. The back of the quarry was cliff standing straight out of the water, and there were no buildings except a stone hut near the entrance, and a machinery shed which was submerged when the quarry flooded. Over the years the shed's sheet-metal walls and roof rusted away, leaving its metal skeleton. On 14 October 1979 the handless body of narcotics dealer Marty Johnstone (\\"Mr Asia\\") was discovered in the quarry by local divers. Johnstone had been murdered on the orders of his associate Terry Clark (\\"Mr Big\\"). The discovery led to an international police investigation and the breakup of the \\"Mr Asia\\" narcotics gang. Around the year 2000 it was pumped dry, and over 250 cars and much rubbish were removed from it, and it was landscaped, and re-flooded, and scuba diving centre buildings built by it, and objects were submerged for divers to dive on.  Facilities  The Delph has a cafe, shop, changing facilities, swimming pool, training room, equipment hire and an air filling station.

Underwater features  There are many things for divers to explore including speedboats, a Jet Provost, armoured personnel carriers, a light tank, containers, a concrete tube, and a gnome garden, and a playground. As well as these there are training platforms at various depths from 3m to 9m. All are marked by surface buoys.  Underwater life  The Delph is well stocked with a large variety of fish including koi carp: bags of food can be bought to feed the fish. Angling is not allowed there.

The virus that causes this disease belongs to the genus Lymphocystivirus of the family Iridoviridae. Aquarists often come across this virus when their fish are stressed such as when put into a new environment and the virus is able to grow. The fish start growing small white pin-prick like growths on their fins or skin and this is often mistaken for infection by Ichthyophthirius multifiliis in the early stages. It soon clumps together to form a cauliflower-like growth on the skin, mouth, fins, and occasionally the gills. This virus appears to present itself as lesions at differing locations depending on the species of fish being attacked, often complicating initial diagnosis. Lesions at the base of the dorsal fin are common among freshwater species of Central American origin, most notably Herichthys carpintis; inside the mouth of Herichthys cyanoguttatus and Geophagus steindachneri; on the tail fin of koi, carp, and US native sunfish (Lepomis spp.); on the side flanks of walleye, sauger and flounder; on head or tail areas of common goldfish, and oranda variants. Lymphocystis does show some host-specificity, i.e., each strain (or species) of lymphocystis can infect only its primary host fish, or some additional closely related, fish. There is no known cure for this virus, though a privately owned fish research and breeding facility near Gainesville, Florida has reportedly been able to suppress the virus into remission using the human anti-DNA virus drug acyclovir at the rate of 200 mg per 10 US gallons for 2 days. Otherwise, some aquarists recommend surgery to remove the affected area if it is very serious, followed by an antibiotic bath treatment to prevent a secondary bacterial infection olllf the open wounds. Eventually the growths inhibit the fish's ability to swim, breathe or eat, and secondary bacterial infections usually kill the fish. Usually the best cure is to simply give the fish a stress-free life, a weekly bacteria treatment and the virus will slowly subside and the fins will repair themselves. This can take many months. Like most viral infections, even in humans, the first outbreaks are the most serious, whilst the immune system \\"learns\\" how to suppress it, the outbreaks become less severe over time assuming the organism survives the initial outbreaks.

A descendant of the Democrat Party, the AP was dominated by S√ºleyman Demirel, who served six times as prime minister, and was in office at the time of the military coup on September 12, 1980. Along with all other political parties in Turkey, the Justice Party was suppressed in the immediate aftermath of the coup. It was subsequently re-established as the True Path Party in 1983. Justice Party was a liberal conservative party. It advocated Kemalist principles, parliamentary democracy and a market economy. It strongly supported membership in NATO and close relations with the United States.  History  = Establishment = With the 1960 coup d'√©tat, Turkey's generals disbanded the formerly dominant Democrat Party. They could not, however, entirely dismantle the vast grassroots organization that this party had left behind. Democrat Party officials were based in many of the squatter neighborhoods in Turkey's larger cities, and would quickly incorporate newly arrived Anatolian migrants into the party's fold.Sherwood, 57 A number of parties soon emerged to reclaim this newly partyless Democrat voting bloc. The Justice Party was one of these neo-Democratic parties, first established by retired general Ragƒ±p G√ºm√º≈üpala in 1961.Ahmad, 128 It immediately adopted the galloping horse logo of the Democrat Party. The Justice Party quickly proved the most successful in consolidating the existing Democrat Party provincial organizations, particularly in the western regions of the country. The New Turkey Party, however, was initially more successful in eastern Turkey.Sherwood, 60 In the 1961 elections, the two post-Democrat parties combined to win a very impressive 48.5% of the vote, 34.8% of which went to the Justice Party alone.Ahmad, 127 The ruling generals, however, would not allow for a neo-Democrat government to replace the old order they had brought down. Instead they asked ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, whose Republican People's Party was the largest party with 36.7% of the vote, to form a coalition government. = Rise = ƒ∞n√∂n√º's various coalitions would form the government until 1964, but in the meantime the Justice Party continued to grow, steadily gaining votes at the expense of the smaller post-Democrat parties.Sherwood, 60 The Republican People's Party eventual turn towards left of centre would also help to give the military a somewhat more favorable view of the Justice Party.Dodd, 21 In this political climate, the 1963 nationwide local elections gained increased importance, and eventually came to be seen as a political referendum on the newly established parties.Sherwood, 60 The Justice Party ultimately emerged as a triumphant winner, winning around 46% of the vote and establishing itself as the most popular party in the country.Ahmad, 127 With its popular appeal well established, the Justice Party turned to issues of leadership. G√ºm√º≈üpala died in 1964, and questions soon emerged over who would succeed him as the party's leader.Ahmad, 128 Sadettin Bilgi√ß, a doctor by training, had become acting party president following G√ºm√º≈üpala's death, and initially emerged as the favorite for the position. But the Turkish press tarnished Bilgi√ß's reputation, accusing him of political and religious conservatism.Sherwood, 61 Party leaders soon started to worry that he would ruin the party's image with the Turkish intelligentsia and, more importantly, the army. Indeed, the military head of state, Cemal G√ºrsel, began pushing for a more progressive candidate to take charge - S√ºleyman Demirel. Demirel came from a modest village background, and climbed up the social latter by the way of his education. He had studied in the United States as an Eisenhower fellow and then worked in a US multinational construction company.Ahmad, 131 He appealed to the party's base of newly urbanized rural migrants, who could identify with his modest beginnings and status as a self-made man.Ahmad, 128 At the Justice Party's national convention in December 1964, Demirel ultimately defeated Bilgi√ß for the party's general-president post.Sherwood, 61 Once firmly in charge, Demirel began his assault on ƒ∞n√∂n√º's fragile coalition, making sure it failed to win a vote of confidence in early 1965. Parliamentary bickering finally led to the triumphant 1965 elections, in which the Justice Party received nearly 53% of the vote and promptly formed a majority government with 240 seats.Ahmad, 127 The party had achieved this result by appealing to small-holder peasants emerging from poverty, small commercial and industrial groups as well as the newly rich farmers; it performed most strongly in the relatively rich western provinces of Turkey, along the Aegean coast and in Thrace. This Justice Party victory was simultaneously a historical loss for the Republican People's Party, which suffered the worst defeat in its political history by winning only 134 seats and 29% of the vote.Sherwood, 55 = Decline = The Justice Party's good fortune, however, did not last for long. The small Anatolian enterprises that had formed a key part of the party's constituency couldn't compete with the Istanbul area's large, modern corporations. These entrepreneurs felt betrayed, and defected from the Justice Party to smaller rightist alternatives.Ahmad, 133 Meanwhile, the country suffered through increasing socio-political strife, as conflicts between leftist and rightist groups turned increasingly violent. Since Demirel symbolized a pro-Western capitalist current in the Turkish establishment, he became an easy target for both the far left and the religious right.Ahmad, 131 The party was still able to win the 1969 elections, carrying 256 seats with around 46.5% of the vote, but the overall situation grew increasingly chaotic. The near-constant street violence escalated, threatening the Turkish economy and ultimately provoking the military to intervene once again in 1971.Ahmad, 142 With the power once again firmly in its hands, the military forced Demirel to resign. The Justice Party was not able to win the elections held in 1973 and 1977, but Demirel was able to serve as prime minister three more times between 1975 and 1980, albeit with coalition partners. On September 12, 1980, the military once again staged a coup d'√©tat, and this time banned Demirel and the Justice Party from the country's politics. After an extended pause, the party eventually reemerged as the True Path Party, complete with the galloping horse logo, in 1983. { class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:center\\" + Grand National Assembly of Turkey ! rowspan=2 Election ! colspan=3 Votes ! colspan=2 Seats - ! style=\\"width:50px\\" # ! style=\\"width:50px\\" % ! style=\\"width:50px\\" Rank ! style=\\"width:50px\\" # ! style=\\"width:50px\\" ¬± - ! 1961  3,527,435  34.8  2nd  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ''''''  new - ! 1965  4,921,235  52.9  1st  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ''''''  82 - ! 1969  4,229,712  46.5  1st  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ''''''  16 - ! 1973  3,197,897  29.8  2nd  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ''''''  107 - ! 1977  5,468,202  36.9  2nd  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ''''''  40 } References Sources *Ahmad, Feroz. \\"Turkey: The Quest for Identity\\".

The station was opened in 1875 to serve the increasing settlement at ≈åtƒÅhuhu, with a road eventually constructed to the station. The station included a goods shed and a main building, which however burned down in 1909 after a fire in the oil room got out of hand with no water supply available to suppress the fires. Upgrade In May 2011, Auckland Transport and KiwiRail started work to lengthen the platform to accommodate longer passenger trains. The platform area around the signal box was raised and further platform installed around the base of the pedestrian over bridge to Walmsley Road. In July 2011, the signal box at the station was one of the last to be decommissioned in Auckland, as part of a project to upgrade the signalling of the Auckland suburban network in preparation for electrification.

At least 45 people, including five children, were killed and another 184 injured. It was the worst train disaster in Montenegrin history.  Incident  The derailment occurred shortly after 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) about 10 km north of the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica on the Belgrade-Bar railway, renowned as one of the most scenic lines in Europe. A local class 412 train carrying around 300 people from Bijelo Polje in the north of Montenegro to the Adriatic Sea port of Bar derailed above a 100 m-deep ravine above the Moraƒça river, into which it fell. Many of the casualties were said to be children returning from a skiing holiday in the north. NBA player Nikola Vucevic, who was traveling with his father on the train, was among the survivors of the derailment. According to the Montenegrin Interior Minister, Jusuf Kalamperoviƒá, the accident was caused by a failure in the braking system. Minister of Transport Andrija Lompar and Director of Montenegro Railways Ranko Medenica immediately resigned over the accident, and train driver Slobodan Drobnjak was arrested on suspicion of negligence.  Official inquest  As soon as he arrived at Podgorica hospital on the night of the disaster, Drobnjak was questioned by the investigative judge Zoran Radoviƒá of the Podgorica Elementary Court.B92 - Vesti - 43 ≈ærtve udesa voza, troje kritiƒçno 2006-01-24 The day after the accident, before the detailed investigation had started and contrary to eye- witness reports that the braking system was faulty, Montenegro Railways executive Momƒçilo Rakoƒçeviƒá suggested that human error was the reason for disaster, blaming Drobnjak explicitly: \\"According to preliminary, partially incomplete data, it could be said that the accident probably happened because the train operator and the accompanying staff did not follow the operating procedure which should have prevented the train from self-starting down the incline\\". Judge Radoviƒá said on January 25, 2006 that the \\"most probable cause of the accident is the failure of braking system\\". He elaborated, \\"700 meters before the accident there was no problem with the brakes, the train stopped the way it should. All the facts so far point to the brake failure and further investigation will determine why and how\\".B92 - Vesti - 44 poginula u ≈æelezniƒçkoj nesreƒái 2006-01-25 That evening he interrogated Drobnjak for three hours in the presence of state prosecutor Veselin Vuƒçkoviƒá. After the interrogation in a hospital where Drobnjak was awaiting surgery for the shattered hip he suffered in the disaster, judge Radoviƒá detained him for one month as the investigation continued. By January 26, 2006, three days after the accident, there was quite a lot of confusion, with opposing statements. Judge Radoviƒá said the investigation could last as long as six months. He also warned Montenegro Railways management to stop making statements that prejudicate the outcome of the investigation.B92 - Vesti - Umrla beba roƒëena posle nesreƒáe 2006-01-26 Speaking to the Podgorica daily Pobjeda, he said that the primary goal of his investigation was to determine whether Drobnjak was responsible, but that it would also included wider aspects of railway safety. On January 27, 2006, Vuƒçkoviƒá requested that the judge open the investigation against Drobnjak for the \\"grave endangerment of traffic safety with deadly consequence\\". Drobnjak's lawyers, Dragana Vujoviƒá and Goran Rodiƒá, appealed against his one-month detention on January 28, 2006: \\"He was assigned detention on the grounds that he might flee and/or influence witnesses. It is completely ridiculous for the possibility of escape to be declared as grounds for detention in this case. He was operated on yesterday, and long rehabilitation awaits him. And as far as possibility of influencing witnesses goes, he has already been questioned twice in great detail.\\"B92 - Vesti - ≈Ωalba na pritvor ma≈°inovoƒëi 2006-01-28  Trial  On July 23, 2006, base prosecutor's office in Podgorica indicted 12 employees of Montenegrin Railways.

Public reaction  Asked in the wake of Lompar's and Medenica's resignations if the government should resign, deputy Prime Minister Miroslav Ivani≈°eviƒá responded that train accidents occur even in much more developed countries with better infrastructure, adding that the government invested a lot in developing its railway infrastructure.B92 - Vesti - CG: Najmanje 40 poginulo 2006-01-23 By Friday January 27, 2006 there were strong reactions to what many perceived to be unjust public singling-out of Drobnjak. The non-governmental organization Group for Changes offered free legal counsel to him and accused Railways of Montenegro of engaging in a public smear campaign with the aim of washing their hands of responsibility by sacrificing an employee. Even more outrage ensued when a near-accident was reported barely three days after the tragedy. On January 26, 2006 morning train 6151 from Podgorica arrived at Bar with a cracked wheel on the locomotive. The verdict was met with public outrage as after the trial in front of the court there were people yelling and old women, cousins of the killed, crying.

Most commonly, the term is used to refer to the interconversion of the two chair conformers of cyclohexane derivatives, which is specifically referred to as a chair flip, although other cycloalkanes and inorganic rings undergo similar processes. Cyclohexane Cyclohexane is a prototype for low- energy degenerate ring flipping. The 'chair' is the strongly preferred conformation. Two 1H NMR signals should be observed in principle, corresponding to axial and equatorial protons. However, due to the cyclohexane chair flip, only one signal is seen for a solution of cyclohexane at room temperature, as the axial and equatorial proton rapidly interconvert relative to the NMR time scale. The coalescence temperature at 60 MHz is ca. ‚Äì60 ¬∞C. The conformational changes that occur in a cyclohexane ring flip take place over several stages. Structure D (10.8 kcal/mol) is the highest energy transition state of the process. The molecular motions involved in a chair flip are detailed in the figure on the right: The half-chair conformation (D, 10.8 kcal/mol, C2 symmetry) is the energy maximum when proceeding from the chair conformer (A, 0 kcal/mol reference, D3d symmetry) to the higher energy twist-boat conformer (B, 5.5 kcal/mol, D2 symmetry). The boat conformation (C, 6.9 kcal/mol, C2v symmetry) is a local energy maximum for the interconversion of the two mirror image twist-boat conformers, the second of which is converted to the other chair confirmation through another half-chair. At the end of the process, all axial positions have become equatorial and vice versa. The overall barrier of 10.8 kcal/mol corresponds to a rate constant of about 105 s‚Äì1 at room temperature. Note that the twist-boat (D2) conformer and the half-chair (C2) transition state are in chiral point groups and are therefore chiral molecules. In the figure, the two depictions of B and two depictions of D are pairs of enantiomers. As a consequence of the chair flip, the axially- substituted and equatorially-substituted conformers of a molecule like chlorocyclohexane cannot be isolated at room temperature. However, in some cases, the isolation of individual conformers of substituted cyclohexane derivatives has been achieved at low temperatures (‚Äì150 ¬∞C). Other cases Most compounds with nonplanar rings engage in degenerate ring flipping. One well-studied example is titanocene pentasulfide, where the inversion barrier is high relative to cyclohexane's. Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane on the other hand is subject to a very low barrier. The 1H NMR spectrum of titanocene pentasulfide features two signals at room temperature, a consequence of its relative rigidity.

Starting publication in the Franco- Belgian comics magazine Pilote in 1963, the series presents the comic misadventures of an anti-hero. The name derives from \\"talon d'Achille\\", the French term for an \\"Achilles' heel\\", which suits the character although the Achilles' heel of Achille Talon is not his heel but his large nose. Publication history The first Achille Talon gag was published in Pilote on November 7, 1963. After several years of gags and increasing popularity, Achille Talon became a dedicated magazine of its own, starting publication on October 1, 1975. Not achieving the intended success, the magazine ceased publication after one year, producing only six issues. The album series has produced 46 volumes. Achille Talon is presented in two quite different formats: there are album length stories such as Achille Talon et la main du serpent (Achille Talon and the Serpent's Hand), a 44-page story, as well as albums with only gags that run one or two pages each. Regardless of format, Achille Talon would typically first appear a couple pages at a time in the weekly magazine Pilote, then be collected later for hardcover or softcover books.  Characters  Achille Talon is a bourgeois who likes to think he's an eloquent (others say voluble) intellectual. He is vain to the extent that he builds a giant statue of himself in his front garden and desperately tries to get on the good side of the local gentry. That being said, Achille Talon is a gentleman, an intrepid traveler and an animal lover. He values etiquette and sometimes resorts to activism (e.g., pro peace or against pollution) or inventions. He is often at odds with his neighbour Hilarion Lefuneste, who loves to argue too. (In French, le funeste means \\"the grievous/fateful one\\" suggesting any dealings with him will have negative consequences.) A man in his forties, Achille is single and lives at home with his parents. His father, Alambic Dieudonn√© Corydon Talon, is a beer-fanatic, while his mother, unnamed but always \\"maman\\", is a strong, earthy, loving bourgeois housewife. He never tires of the attentions of the aristocratic Virgule de Guillemets, who brings sophistication to his life. Achille Talon can be courageous and magnanimous, a protector of animals and ever vigilant guardian of proper etiquette, so much so that he fights with an author of an etiquette book ‚Äî over which of them has the honour of giving the right of way. He is a patron of the arts (as long as he is the one portrayed) and briefly a wise, though ostensibly tyrannical, head of state. Device On a page verbal and visual humor are usually mixed, although sometimes the humour is strictly visual, sometimes mostly verbal. The visual humor is often from exaggeration (phones often do not simply ring, but explode), however occasionally it is subtle and understated (a factory spewing out toxic fumes, bearing a sign \\"Gourmet Foods\\", or a funnel in the soil of an overflowing pot, where watering with any tool could hardly miss). The verbal humour usually consists of long rants, in which internal inconsistencies, puns and sheer nonsense are cleverly interspersed. Of course, Achille Talon is almost invariably proven wrong and ends up being the butt of the joke.  Typical quotes  * \\"Bof\\" or \\"Hop\\" are his favorite interjections, especially if things do not turn out as expected. \\"Bof!\\" is the verbal equivalent of the Gaulish shrug, rather like \\"Whatever!\\" * \\"After careful consideration of the facts, I've decided to faint. It may not be very heroic, but it is relaxing. Therefore, zzzzz.\\" Translation into English In 1981, Dargaud Canada translated Le Tr√©sor de Virgule into English as Magnesia's Treasure. Achille Talon was translated into Walter Melon, presumably a pun on \\"watermelon\\". The paperback volume included two features not included in the French original: a page introducing the characters (similar to the opening of Asterix books), and a humorous three page illustrated essay on Greg and the publishing industry in general. The back cover is the familiar picture of Talon leaning out of a newsstand snagging Lefuneste, with a small inset with a photograph of Greg titled \\"AUTHOR AND GENIUS\\", followed by a quote \\"SUCCESS DID NOT SPOIL ME. I WAS BORN SPOILED.\\" Television adaptation A television series of fifty-two twenty-six-minute episodes was made for Canal+ in 1996 by Saban International Paris. Each episode is broken up into two short stories. It was broadcast in France for the first time on September 3, 1997, in the television show C + Cl√©o on Canal+. The animated series is very different from the original comic. In the animated cartoon, Talon is a very awkward superhero who offers his heroic services for hire, replacing such characters as Luke Skywalker, Zorro and Tarzan when they become indisposed. Talon manages to make justice triumph by pure luck. The series was renamed Walter Melon for English-speaking television. The English version was broadcast on the Fox Family Channel.

This condition occurs only in females, as there are no Y chromosomes present that could trigger male development. Tetrasomy X was first described in 1961, and since then approximately 100 cases have been reported worldwide. Approximately 60 affected patients have been described in the medical literature. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of tetrasomy X are highly variable, ranging from relatively mild to severe. Symptoms are often similar to those of trisomy X. Physically, patients tend to exhibit distinctive facial features, such as epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridges, upslanting palpebral fissures, midface hypoplasia, small mouths, cleft or high arched palates, delayed or absent teeth, or enamel defects. The majority have also been reported as being longer and taller. Many also show joint and muscle tone abnormalities, including hypotonia and joint looseness in the hips. Skeletal problems may also be present, including abnormal curvatures of the spine. An informal study of twenty girls with tetrasomy and pentasomy X found that 10 percent of patients had joint laxity in the hips, while 20 percent had joint limitations. Developmentally, people with tetrasomy X frequently show mild delays in the areas of speech development and articulation, language expression and understanding, and reading skills. Delays in motor development are also present, with walking ages ranging from 16 months to 4.5 years. About 50% of patients undergo puberty normally, whereas the other 50% experiences no puberty, partial puberty without secondary sexual characteristics, or complete puberty with menstrual irregularities and/or early menopause (possibly as early as the teens). Medical literature reports four tetra-X pregnancies, two healthy, one with trisomy 21, one stillborn with omphalocele. In terms of internal organ systems, tetrasomy X patients may have abnormal vision, hearing, circulatory systems, kidneys, or nervous systems. Disorders of the eye include myopia, nystagmus, coloboma, microphthalmus, or optic nerve hypoplasia. In terms of hearing, patients are more prone to ear infections, sound blockage, or nerve abnormalities. Several cardiac defects have also been reported, including ventricular/atrial septal defects, atresia, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, and conotruncal or valvular cardiac defects. Tetrasomy X patients also appear to be more prone to seizure activity, although there is no documented abnormalities in brain function or structure when analyzed using an EEG or MRI. Causes and diagnosis right Tetrasomy X is a chromosomal aneuploidy, meaning it arises from a defect in meiosis. This can occur when homologous X chromosomes fail to separate in the formation of the egg or sperm. Tetrasomy X is usually suspected based on symptoms present in the individual and is confirmed via karyotyping, which reveals the extra X chromosomes. Treatment and prognosis The general prognosis for girls with tetrasomy X is relatively good. Due to the variability of symptoms, some tetrasomy X girls are able to function normally, whereas others will need medical attention throughout their lives. Traditionally, treatment for tetrasomy X has been management of the symptoms and support for learning. Most girls are placed on estrogen treatment to induce breast development, arrest longitudinal growth, and stimulate bone formation to prevent osteoporosis. Speech, occupational, and physical therapy may also be needed depending on the severity of the symptoms.  Other species  In the echidna, this kind of chromosomal arrangement is normal, with genetic sex differentiated as follows: * 63 (X1Y1X2Y2X3Y3X4Y4X5, male) and * 64 (X1X1X2X2X3X3X4X4X5X5, female) See also * Triple X syndrome * XXXXX syndrome References Further reading   External links  * Tetrasomy & Pentasomy X Syndrome Information and Support Rare diseases Sex chromosome aneuploidies ","title":"Tetrasomy X"},{"id":"3823838","text":"GSWR can refer to one of two former railway companies in the British Isles: * Glasgow and South Western Railway of Scotland (often \\"G&SWR;\\") * Great Southern and Western Railway of Ireland (often \\"GS&WR;\\") It can also refer to the Georgia Southwestern Railroad.

In essence, non-linear springs are attached to the foundation in place of the soil. The springs can be represented by the following equation: : p = ky where k is the non-linear spring stiffness defined by the p-y curve, y is the deflection of the spring, and p is the force applied to the spring.

It was developed and published by Irem. Story It is the 666th year for the world of magic, and the Crimson Kingdom is facing destruction at the hands of The Black Slayer, Demon King of the Underground Dark Empire. Realizing that his days are numbered, the 16th Crimson Emperor, Ronnie IV, decides to entrust his two infant sons, Randy and Zakk, to his faithful servant, Ozzy. With Slayer's forces closing in, Ozzy, Randy and Zakk escape to another dimension, with the hope of eventually bringing light back into the world. Over the following 17 years, Randy, Zakk, and Ozzy devote and train themselves to the cause of Magic Justice, becoming wizard kings. Meanwhile, Black Slayer has increased his empire over the countryside, making his interdimensional forces even stronger. In order to defeat Black Slayer and his army, Randy must retrieve the Five Crimson Emblem Seals. Making matters worse, Randy now must wage his war against Black Slayer alone, for Zakk suddenly goes missing and Ozzy passes away. Gameplay The game consists of six stages in total. The player can learn magic spells at the completion of each level, and defeating the end level boss. Such as a magic spell that can freeze lava. It is similar to the game Getsu F≈´ma Den. In fact, one of the stages has sprites and graphics similar to those found in Konami's other game, Contra (the final boss is also very similar to Contra's). The HUD is like the one used in Nintendo's Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The player has an infinite supply of fireballs to attack enemies. Enemies in the game include gargoyles, and flying eyeballs. In order to find and defeat Black Slayer, the player must travel through six stages, which primarily consists of forests, castles, and caverns - all while seeking the Five Crimson Family Seals. The Five Crimson Family Seals are powerful magic spells, which are Twin Fire, Blizzard, Rock Breaker, Overdrive and Thunder. In addition to acquiring the seals, the player must also seek out the Bracelet, Jump Boots, Wizard's Staff, and The Cape of Protection, all of which assist physical strength and endurance.  Development  The game was developed by Japanese game developer Irem. The game is based on the 1983 album Holy Diver by Dio; however, it is completely unofficial and has no connection with the band. The game has four main characters who are named after musicians Ronnie James Dio, Ozzy Ozborne, Zakk Wylde, and Randy Rhoads. Other characters and locations in the game are references to rock music such as the Crimson Kingdom and Black Slayer.  Release  The game was self-published by Irem and released on April 28, 1989 for the Famicom (Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System). The game was scheduled for a North American release in the same year, and even received a brief preview in Electronic Gaming Monthly. However, the game was never released outside Japan. Since release, the game has gone onto becoming a rare game that is sought after by collectors. In 2018, the title is noted to cost around $75 USD for just the game, and up to $200 USD for the complete game with box. Also, unauthorized reproductions of the game have been produced and sold as well. In 2018, 29 years after the game was first released, distributor Retro-bit announced that they would give Holy Diver a worldwide physical re-release for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The is the first time the game is released outside of Japan, and the game would be translated into English. The new edition is limited to 2,900 copies, and costs 35 USD for the regular version, and 60 USD for the Collector's Edition . The collector's edition of the game included a display box to house the game, pins, stickers, and artwork. The game was also released on Retro-bit's microconsole the Super Retro-Cade.  Reception  Multiple reviewers both contemporary and retrospective noted the game as very difficult. Many reviewers and previews also noted the similarity to Konami's earlier Castlevania NES installments, with one publication calling the game a \\"Castlevania Clone. Weekly Famitsu on release gave the game a 22 out of 40 score. Brazilian magazine VideoGame gave the game an overall score of 3 out of 5. In 2018, Destructoid gave the game a positive review.

It is similar to the building of standard railway lines, but there are differences. In particular, construction process is more precise in order for the track to be suitable for regular use at 300 km/h (186 mph). The quality of construction was put to the test in particular during the TGV world speed record runs on the LGV Atlantique; the track was used at over 500 km/h (310 mph) without suffering significant damage. This contrasts with previous French world rail speed record (326/331 km/h in 1955) attempts which resulted in severe deformation of the track. Service French TGV network The LGV opened to the public between Paris and Lyon on 27 September 1981. Contrary to its earlier fast services, SNCF intended TGV service for all types of passengers, with the same initial ticket price as trains on the parallel conventional line. To counteract the popular misconception that the TGV would be a premium service for business travellers, SNCF started a major publicity campaign focusing on the speed, frequency, reservation policy, normal price, and broad accessibility of the service. This commitment to a democratised TGV service was enhanced in the Mitterrand era with the promotional slogan \\"Progress means nothing unless it is shared by all\\". The TGV was considerably faster (in terms of door to door travel time) than normal trains, cars, or aeroplanes. The trains became widely popular, the public welcoming fast and practical travel. TGV in Europe's high speed rail system. R√©seau power car with Duplex trainset at Gare de Lyon Preparing the trackbed The work on a high-speed line (ligne √† grande vitesse, or LGV) begins with earthmoving. The trackbed is carved into the landscape, using scrapers, graders, bulldozers and other heavy machinery. All fixed structures are built; these include bridges, flyovers, culverts, game tunnels, and the like. Drainage facilities, most notably the large ditches on each side of the trackbed, are constructed. Supply bases are established near the end of the high-speed tracks, where crews will form work trains to carry rail, sleepers and other supplies to the work site. Next, a layer of compact gravel is spread on the trackbed. This, after being compacted by rollers, provides an adequate surface for vehicles with tyres. TGV tracklaying then proceeds. The tracklaying process is not particularly specialized to high-speed lines; the same general technique is applicable to any track that uses continuous welded rail. The steps outlined below are used around the world in modern tracklaying. TGV track, however, conforms to stringent requirements on materials, dimensions and tolerances. Laying the track To begin laying track, a gantry crane that rides on rubber tires is used to lay down panels of prefabricated track. These are laid roughly in the location where one of the tracks will be built (all LGVs have two tracks). Each panel is 18 metres (60 feet) long, and rests on wooden sleepers. No ballast is used at this stage, since the panel track is temporary. Once the panel track is laid, a work train (pulled by diesel locomotives) can bring in the sections of continuous welded rail that will be used for the permanent way of this first track. The rail comes from the factory in lengths varying from 200 m (660 ft) to 400 m (1310 ft). Such long pieces of rail are just laid across several flatcars; they are very flexible, so this does not pose a problem. A special crane unloads the rail sections and places them on each side of the temporary track, approximately 3.5 m (12 ft) apart. This operation is usually carried out at night, for thermal reasons. The rail itself is standard UIC section, 60 kg/m (40 lb/ft), with a tensile strength of 800 newtons per square millimetre or megapascals (116,000 psi). For the next step, a gantry crane is used again. This time, however, the crane rides on the two rails that were just laid alongside the temporary track. A train of flatcars, half loaded with LGV sleepers, arrives at the site. It is pushed by a special diesel locomotive, which is low enough to fit underneath the gantry cranes. The cranes remove the panels of temporary track, and stack them onto the empty half of the sleeper train. Next, they pick up sets of 30 LGV sleepers, pre- arranged with the proper spacing (60 cm, or 24 in), using a special fixture. The sleepers are laid on the gravel bed where the panel track was. The sleeper train leaves the worksite loaded with sections of panel track. The sleepers, sometimes known as bi-bloc sleepers, are U41 twin block reinforced concrete, 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in.) wide, and weigh 245 kg (540 lb) each. They are equipped with hardware for Nabla RNTC spring fasteners, and a 9 mm (3/8 in.) rubber pad. (Rubber pads are always used under the rail on concrete sleepers, to avoid cracking). Next, a rail threader is used to lift the rails onto their final position on the sleepers. This machine rides on the rails just like the gantry cranes, but can also support itself directly on a sleeper. By doing this, it can lift the rails, and shift them inwards over the ends of the sleepers, to the proper gauge (standard gauge). It then lowers them onto the rubber sleeper cushions, and workers use a pneumatically operated machine to bolt down the Nabla clips with a predetermined torque. The rails are canted inward at a slope of 1 in 20. Joining track sections The sections of rail are welded together using thermite. Conventional welding (using some type of flame) does not work well on large metal pieces such as rails, since the heat is conducted away too quickly. Thermite is better suited to this job. It is a mix of aluminium powder and rust (iron oxide) powder, which reacts to produce iron, aluminum oxide, and a great deal of heat, making it ideal to weld rail. Before the rail is joined, its length must be adjusted very accurately. This ensures that the thermal stresses in the rail after it is joined into one continuous piece do not exceed certain limits, resulting in lateral kinks (in hot weather) or fractures (in cold weather). The joining operation is performed by thermite welding process which is equipped with a rail saw, a weld shear and a grinder. When the thermite welding process is complete, the weld is ground to the profile of the rail, resulting in a seamless join between rail sections. Stress in the rail due to temperature variations is absorbed without longitudinal strain, except near bridges where an expansion joint is sometimes used. Adding ballast The next step consists of stuffing a deep bed of ballast underneath the new track. The ballast arrives in a train of hopper cars pulled by diesel locomotives. Handling this train is challenging, since the ballast must be spread evenly. If the train stops, ballast can pile over the rails and derail it. A first layer of ballast is dumped directly onto the track, and a tamping-lining-levelling machine, riding on the rails, forces the stones underneath the sleepers. Each pass of this machine can raise the level of the track by 8 cm (3 in), so several passes of ballasting and of the machine are needed to build up a layer of ballast at least 32 cm (1 ft) thick under the sleepers. The ballast is also piled on each side of the track for lateral stability. The machine performs the initial alignment of the track. Next, a ballast regulator distributes the ballast evenly. Finally, a dynamic vibrator machine shakes the track to perform the final tamping, effectively simulating the passing of 2,500 axles. Finishing construction Now that the first track is almost complete, work begins on the adjacent track. This time, however, it is not necessary to lay a temporary track. Trains running on the first track bring the sleepers, and then the rail, which is unloaded directly onto the sleepers by dispensing arms that swing out to the proper alignment. The Nabla fasteners are secured, and the ballast is stuffed under the track as before. The two tracks are now essentially complete, but the work on the line is not finished. The catenary masts need to be erected, and the wire strung on them. Once the catenary is complete, the track is given final alignment adjustments down to millimeter tolerances. The ballast is then blown to remove smaller gravel fragments and dust, which might be kicked up by trains. This step is especially important on high-speed tracks, since the blast of a passing train is strong. Finally, TGV trains are tested on the line at gradually increasing speeds. The track is qualified at speeds slightly higher than will be used in everyday operations (typically 350 km/h, or 210 mph), before being opened to commercial service.

It had an offset side platform layout with no connection between the two platforms. Both the northbound and southbound platforms have since been demolished. Closure Because of lack of patronage, from 25 October 2005 the only services stopping at the station were four south-bound morning peak services to set down passengers on school days only, for pupils of nearby King's College. The station exit was close to the school. Pupils going home would use Middlemore railway station, which is approximately to the south. The station closed permanently on 9 December 2011. The closure was proposed due to the limited number of services (only four trains per day during the school term), the short-distance to/from Middlemore Station, and the cost to upgrade the station to meet current standards.

First-team opportunities were limited, however, and Gu√©ret made only 18 starts for Millwall (with a further two as substitute) in all competitions. He was on the bench as Millwall lost the 2004 FA Cup Final to Manchester United, and contributed to two games earlier in the cup run against Telford United and Burnley. On 1 July 2004, Gu√©ret signed for Swansea City. The club achieved promotion from League Two in his first season at Bury but Gu√©ret's celebrations turned sour when the Swansea players entered the directors box against the orders of the game safety officer after the final whistle.

Etymology \\"Keen\\" as a noun or verb comes from the Irish and Scottish Gaelic term caoineadh (\\"to cry, to weep\\") and references to it from the seventh, eighth and twelfth centuries are extensive. History Written sources that refer to the practice in Ireland and Gaelic Scotland appear from the sixteenth century on. The Irish tradition of keening over the body during the funeral procession and at the burial site is distinct from the wake, the practice of watching over the corpse, which takes place the night before the burial, and may last for more than one night. The \\"keen\\" itself is thought to have been constituted of stock poetic elements (the listing of the genealogy of the deceased, praise for the deceased, emphasis on the woeful condition of those left behind etc.) set to vocal lament. While generally carried out by one or several women, a chorus may have been intoned by all present. Physical movements involving rocking, kneeling or clapping accompanied the keening woman (bean chaointe) who was often paid for her services.

Her body was never found. The killing gained notoriety primarily through the New York City newspapers. Disappearance Justina's disappearance had gone unnoticed for more than a year. Teachers and school officials failed to take note of her long absence. In February, 1997, a relative informed the police that the girl had been missing and possibly had been killed. The subsequent investigation, similar to those in the deaths of Elisa Izquierdo and Nadine Lockwood about the same time, disclosed shortcomings of the New York City child-welfare system. 1997 trial In 1997, the trial of Santiago revealed that he had abused the girl physically for several years and that he had beaten her to death when she had refused to take a bath for a party that night. Justina's mother, Denise Solero, who was Santiago's girlfriend, had likewise been abused by him. Several news reports and editorials portrayed Solero as a victim who was terrified to inform anyone that her daughter had been killed, while other accounts depicted her as an accomplice to the crime who had displayed a depraved indifference toward her daughter's plight. Two years after the killing, Santiago was sentenced to a minimum of six and a maximum of nineteen years in prison. Solero had agreed to testify against Santiago in exchange for probation. It was reported in 1999 that Solero wanted to be reunited with another daughter. It was reported that Solero had changed her name to \\"Forbes\\" and was seeking supervised visits with her then two-year-old daughter, Sierra. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Joseph Bruno said there was no chance for a mother-daughter reunion that year, saying: \\"At this point, I see no basis to allow her to visit with any child, particularly her own child\\". Bruno further said: \\"It may be disappointing, but it should not be a surprise that this is my position.\\"  Comparison to Nixzmary Brown  A January 2008 article by Andrea Peyser in The New York Post compared Justina to Nixzmary Brown, whose murder trial began the same month.

The Philippines‚ÄìUnited States Visiting Forces Agreement, sometimes the PH‚ÄìUS Visiting Forces Agreement, is a bilateral visiting forces agreement between the Philippines and the United States consisting of two separate documents. The first of these documents is commonly referred to as \\"the VFA\\" or \\"VFA-1\\", and the second as \\"VFA-2\\" or \\"the Counterpart Agreement\\". A visiting forces agreement is a version of a status of forces agreement that only applies to troops temporarily in a country. The agreements came into force on May 27, 1999, upon ratification by the Senate of the Philippines.[8], [10] The United States government regards these documents to be executive agreements not requiring approval by the United States Senate.[42] On February 11, 2020, the Philippine government officially notified the U.S. that it would be terminating the VFA, initially set for August 9. However, on June 2, the Philippine government decided on suspending its termination. Provisions The primary effect of the Agreement is that it allows the U.S. government to retain jurisdiction over U.S. military personnel accused of committing crimes in the Philippines, unless the crimes are \\"of particular importance to the Philippines\\". This means that for crimes without this significance, the U.S. can refuse to detain or arrest accused personnel, or may instead prosecute them under U.S. jurisdiction. Under the Visiting Forces Agreement, the local courts have one year to complete any legal proceedings. The Agreement also exempts U.S. military personnel from visa and passport regulations in the Philippines. The Agreement contains various procedural safeguards which amongst other things establish the right to due process and proscribe double jeopardy. The Agreement also prevents U.S. military personnel from being tried in Filipino religious or military courts[V 11]; requires both governments to waive any claims concerning loss of materials (though it does require that the U.S. honor contractual arrangements and comply with U.S. law regarding payment of just and reasonable compensation in settlement of meritorious claims for damage, loss, personal injury or death, caused by acts or omissions of United States personnel)[VI]; exempts material exported and imported by the military from duties or taxes[VII]; and allows unrestricted movement of U.S. vessels and aircraft in the Philippines.[VIII] =Subic rape accusation= The U.S. has at least twice used the Agreement to keep accused military personnel under U.S. jurisdiction. On January 18, 2006, the U.S. military maintained custody of four troops accused of rape while visiting Subic Bay during their trial by a Philippine court. They were held by American officials at the United States Embassy in Manila. This led to protests by those who believe that the agreement is one-sided, prejudicial, and contrary to the sovereignty of the Philippines. The agreement has been characterized as granting immunity from prosecution to U.S. military personnel who commit crimes against Filipinos, and as treating Filipinos as second class citizens in their own country. As a result of these issues, in 2006, some members of the Philippine Congress considered terminating the VFA. However, the agreement was not changed. =Death of Jennifer Laude= A second Philippine court case under the VFA is the one following the death of Jennifer Laude, also involving a U.S. Navy ship docked at Subic Bay. This case happened after the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement was signed. =Supreme Court cases= The constitutionality of the VFA was challenged twice. The case Bayan v. Zamora was dismissed on October 10, 2000 by the Supreme Court of the Philippines, sitting en banc.. The second challenge, Suzette Nicolas y Sombilon Vs. Alberto Romulo, et al. / Jovito R. Salonga, et al. Vs. Daniel Smith, et al. / Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, et al. Vs. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, et al. submitted on January 2, 2007, was decided on February 11, 2009, again by the Supreme Court sitting en banc. In deciding this second challenge, the court ruled 9‚Äì4 (with two justices inhibiting) that, \\"The Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States, entered into on February 10, 1998, is UPHELD as constitutional, ...\\". The decision continued, specifically relating to matters relevant to the Subic Rape Case, \\"... the Romulo-Kenney Agreements of December 19 and 22, 2006 are DECLARED not in accordance with the VFA, and respondent Secretary of Foreign Affairs is hereby ordered to forthwith negotiate with the United States representatives for the appropriate agreement on detention facilities under Philippine authorities as provided in Art. V, Sec. 10 of the VFA, pending which the status quo shall be maintained until further orders by this Court.\\". UP Professor Harry Roque, counsel for former senator Jovito Salonga, one of the petitioners in the case, said in a phone interview regarding the decision on the constitunality of the VFA. \\"We will appeal, ... We are hoping we could convince the other justices to join the four dissenters.\\" Counterpart agreement The primary effect of the agreement is to require the U.S. government to notify Philippine authorities when it becomes aware of the apprehension, arrest or detention of any Philippine personnel visiting the U.S. and, when so requested by the Philippine government, to ask the appropriate authorities to waive jurisdiction in favor of the Philippines, except in cases of special interest to the U.S. Departments of State or Defense.[VIII 1] Waiving of jurisdiction in the U.S. is complicated because the United States is a federation of U.S. states and therefore a federation of jurisdictions. The agreement contains various procedural safeguards to protect rights to due process and proscribe double jeopardy.[VIII 2‚Äì6] The agreement also exempts Philippine personnel from visa formalities and guarantees expedited entry and exit processing;[IV] requires the U.S. to accept Philippine drivers licenses;[V] allows Philippine personnel to carry arms at U.S. military installations while on duty;[VI] provides personal tax exemptions and import/export duty exclusions for Philippine personnel;[X, XI] requires the U.S. to provide health care to Philippine personnel;[XIV] and exempts Philippine vehicles, vessels, and aircraft from landing or ports fees, navigation or overflight charges, road tolls or any other charges for the use of U.S. military installations.[XV] Termination of the agreement On February 11, 2020, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte formally announced to the United States embassy in Manila that he was ending the pact, with termination to take effect in 180 days unless agreed otherwise during that time. Duterte has in the past shown admiration for both the Russian Armed Forces, as well as the Chinese People's Liberation Army, despite the fact that the Philippines and China are embroiled in a dispute in the South China Sea regarding sovereignty over the Spratly Islands. On June 2, 2020, Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. announced that President Duterte ordered the suspension of the agreement's termination \\"in light of political and other developments in the region.\\"  See also  * Balikatan, annual military exercises under the VFA * Mutual Defense Treaty (US-Philippines) * Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement * Philippines‚ÄìAustralia Status of Visiting Forces Agreement * Visiting Forces Act * Visiting forces agreement * Status of forces agreement References Further reading * External links   * United States foreign relations legislation United States military in the Philippines Treaties of the Philippines Treaties of the United States Treaties entered into force in 1999 Philippines‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"Philippines‚ÄìUnited States Visiting Forces Agreement"},{"id":"3823972","text":"Italian edition of Vitruvius' De architectura, translated and illustrated by Cesare Cesariano. Pronaos of the church of Santa Maria presso San Celso, attributed to Cesare Cesariano. Cesare di Lorenzo Cesariano (1475-1543) was an Italian painter, architect and architectural theorist. He authored the first Italian-language version of Vitruvius' De architectura. Biography Cesariano was born in Milan. Information about his life is scarce. In 1496 he lived for a period at Reggio Emilia; in the early 1500s he worked at Parma, where he painted the sacristy of San Giovanni Evangelista. In 1507 he was in Rome, where he met Perugino, Pinturicchio and Luca Signorelli. \\"Vitruvian Man\\", illustration in the edition of Vitruvius' De Architectura by Cesare Cesariano (1521) However, most of his activity was in Milan, where he returned in 1512-1513 as military engineer at Maximilian Sforza's court. He worked at Santa Maria presso San Celso and to part of the renovation of the Sforza Castle; he collaborated in the painting decoration of Milan Cathedral (Duomo), in the Sala dei Deputati, which was demolished in the 19th century. Giorgio Vasari wrote in Bramante's vita: In 1528 Cesariano was appointed as ducal engineer by the Spanish governor of Milan. In 1535 he became director of construction in the Duomo. Works Cesariano is chiefly remembered as the first translator of Vitruvius' treatise De architectura into a modern language (Italian), with his added commentary. It was published, with copious woodcut illustrations, at Como, 1521. It contained 360 pages and was printed in 1300 copies. It was soon plagiarized in editions published at Venice, but all were superseded by Daniele Barbaro's edition, with illustrations by Andrea Palladio, 1556. Vitruvius' technical language is fraught with difficulties. Leon Battista Alberti was of the mind that the Latins thought Vitruvius was writing Greek and the Greeks, Latin. The impenetrable Latin and the lack of illustrations gave freedom to the Renaissance designers, who were able to interpret antique architecture in their own image, all' antica. Cesariano's Vitruvius gives us a clear picture of the Renaissance perception of the architecture of Classical Antiquity. Indeed, the spirit of Milan's Late Gothic Duomo can be recognized in some of Cesariano's woodcuts . Among his illustrations is an attempt at rendering Vitruvius' precepts on the ideally proportioned man, successfully rendered by Leonardo, but attempted by many 15th century theorists Cesariano's illustrations, though not as influential as Sebastiano Serlio's, had some influence in the picturesque and classicizing vocabulary of the Northern Antwerp Mannerism.

This approach is used in a broad range of helping professions in health and social care settings as well as by medical and social science researchers. Introduction People may not be fully aware of the relationship between their mental and emotional wellbeing and the environment. It was first commonly used by psychologist Erik Erikson in his description of the stages of psychosocial development. Mary Richmond, pioneer of American social work regarded there to be a linear relationship between cause and effect in a diagnostic process. In 1941 Gordon Hamilton renamed the 1917 concept of \\"social diagnosis\\" as \\"psychosocial study\\". Psychosocial study was further developed by Hollis in 1964 with emphasis in treatment model. It is contrasted with diverse social psychology, which attempts to explain social patterns within the individual. Problems that occur in one's psychosocial functioning can be referred to as \\"psychosocial dysfunction\\" or \\"psychosocial morbidity.\\" This refers to the lack of development or diverse atrophy of the psychosocial self, often occurring alongside other dysfunctions that may be physical, emotional, or cognitive in nature. Adolph Meyer in the late 1800s stated \\"We cannot understand the individual presentation of mental illness, [and perpetuating factors] without knowing how that person functions in the environment,\\" psychosocial assessment stems from this idea. Scholarly societies in this field bring together researchers, academics and practitioners who are interested in contributing to the development of this inter/trans-disciplinary field of study. There are organisations such as Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), Association for Psychosocial Studies, etc. Psychosocial assessment and intervention Psychosocial assessment considers several key areas related to psychological, biological, and social functioning and the availability of supports. It is a systematic inquiry that arises from the introduction of dynamic interaction; it is an ongoing process that continues throughout a treatment, and is characterized by the circularity of cause- effect/effect-cause. In assessment the clinician/health care professional identifies the problem with the client, takes stock of the resources that are available for dealing with it, and considers the ways in which it might be solved from an educated hypothesis formed by data collection. This hypothesis is tentative in nature and goes through a process of elimination, refinement, or reconstruction in the light of newly obtained data. There are five internal steps in assessment: # Data collection (relevant and current) of the problem presented. # Integrating collected facts with relevant theories. # Formulating a hypothesis (case theory) that gives the presented problem more clarity. # Hypothesis substantiation through exploration of the problem: life history of the client, etiology, personality, environment, stigmas, etc. # Further integration of newer facts identified in the treatment period and preparing a psychosocial report for psychosocial intervention. Assessment includes psychiatric, psychological and social functioning, risks posed to the individual and others, problems required to address from any co-morbidity, personal circumstances including family or other carers. Other factors are the person's housing, financial and occupational status, and physical needs. Assessments when categorized, it particularly includes Life history of the client that include data collection of living situation and finances, social history and supports, family history, coping skills, religious/cultural factors, trauma from systemic issues or abuse and medico-legal factors (assessment of the client‚Äôs awareness of legal documents, surrogate decision- making, power of attorney and consent). Components include: the resource assessment of psycho-spiritual strengths; substance abuse; coping mechanisms, styles and patterns (individual, family level, workplace, and use of social support systems); sleeping pattern; needs and impacts of the problem etc. Advanced clinicians incorporate individual scales, batteries and testing instruments in their assessments. In the late 1980s Hans Eysenck, in an issue of Psychological Inquiry, raised controversies on then assessment methods and it gave way to comprehensive Bio-Psycho-Social assessment. This theoretical model sees behavior as a function of biological factors, psychological issues and the social context. Qualified healthcare professionals conduct the physiological part of these assessments. This thrust on biology expands the field of approach for the client, with the client, through the interaction of these disciplines in a domain where mental illnesses are physical, just as physical conditions have mental components. Likewise, the emotional is both psychological and physical. The clinician‚Äôs comprehension and set of judgments about the client's situation, the assessment through a theory of each case, predicts the intervention. Hence a good psychosocial assessment leads to a good psychosocial intervention that aims to reduce complaints and improve functioning related to mental disorders and/or social problems (e.g., problems with personal relationships, work, or school) by addressing the different psychological and social factors influencing the individual. For example, a psychosocial intervention for an older adult client with a mental disorder might include psychotherapy and a referral to a psychiatrist while also addressing the caregiver's needs in an effort to reduce stress for the entire family system as a method of improving the client's quality of life. Treatment for psychosocial disorders in a medical model usually only involve using drugs and talk therapy. Psychosocial adaptation and support Psychosocial adaptation is a process a person experiences in order to achieve good fitness in person-environment congruence known as adjustment, a state of wisdom oriented activities and psychosocial equilibrium. Psychosocial support is the provision of psychological and social resources to a person by a supporter intended for the benefit of the receiver's ability to cope with problems faced. The allocentric principle within social relationships that promote health and well-being moves individuals to aid victims of terminal illness, disaster, war, catastrophe or violence to foster resilience of communities and individuals. It aims at easing resumption of normal life, facilitating affected people's participation to their convalescence and preventing pathological consequences of potentially traumatic situations. This might extend in forms of informational and instrumental support. See also * Psychosocial needs * Psychological trauma * Mental status examination References Further reading  Haley, J.

Paris: Brosson & Chaud√©; 1819. the condition can result from physical trauma or other situations that lead to air escaping from the lungs, airways, or bowel into the chest cavity. Signs and symptoms The main symptom is usually severe central chest pain. Other symptoms include laboured breathing, voice distortion (as with helium) and subcutaneous emphysema, specifically affecting the face, neck, and chest.Quresi SA, Tilyard A (2008). \\"Unusual Presentation of Spontaneous Mediastinum: A Case Report\\". Cases Journal 1:349. doi:10.1186/1757-1626-1-349. Pneumomediastinum can also be characterized by the shortness of breath that is typical of a respiratory system problem. It is often recognized on auscultation by a \\"crunching\\" sound timed with the cardiac cycle (Hamman's crunch). Pneumomediastinum may also present with symptoms mimicking cardiac tamponade as a result of the increased intrapulmonary pressure on venous flow to the heart.Beg MH, Reyazuddin, Ansari MM (1988). \\"Traumatic tension Pneumomediastinum Mimicking Cardiac Tamponade\\". Thorax 43:576-677. doi: 10.1136/thx.43.7.576. Cause It is most commonly caused by: * Oesophageal rupture, for example in Boerhaave syndrome * Asthma or other conditions leading to alveolar rupture * Bowel rupture, where air in the abdominal cavity tracts up into the chest. It has also been associated with: * Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia * obesity It can be induced to assist thoracoscopic surgery. It can be caused by a pulmonary barotrauma resulting when a person moves to or from a higher pressure environment, such as when a SCUBA diver,Dr. Richard Moon, Diver's Alert Network Vice President and Medical Director, http://www.diversalertnetwork.org/medical/articles/article.asp?articleid=40 a free-diver or an airplane passenger ascends or descends. In rare cases, pneumomediastinum may also arise as a result of blunt chest trauma (e.g. car accidents, fights, over pressure of breathing apparatus), while still evolving in the same fashion as the spontaneous form.Yellin A, Gapany-Gapanavicius M, Lieberman Y (1983). \\"Spontaneous Pneumomedistinum: Is It a Rare Cause of Chest Pain?\\". Thorax 38:383-385. Pneumomediastinum is most commonly seen in otherwise healthy young male patients and may not be prefaced by a relevant medical history of similar ailments.Cicak B, Verona E, Mihatov-Stefanovic I, Vrsalovic R (2009). \\"Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum in a Healthy Adolescent\\". Acta Clinica Croatica 48(4):461-7. Diagnosis Pneumomediastinum is uncommon and occurs when air leaks into the mediastinum. The diagnosis can be confirmed via chest X-ray showing a radiolucent outline around the heart and mediastinum or via CT scanning of the thorax.

Breathing high flow oxygen will increase the absorption of the air. If the air is under pressure and compressing the heart, a needle may be inserted into the cavity, releasing the air. Surgery may be needed to repair the hole in the trachea, esophagus or bowel. If there is lung collapse, it is imperative the affected individual lies on the side of the collapse. Although painful, this allows full inflation of the unaffected lung.

The law may also apply to some foreign non-military persons who are associated with visiting military forces (e.g., dependents, civilian employees, etc.). Such laws commonly address such issues as criminal jurisdiction, treatment of apprehended individuals found to be foreign military personnel who are absent without leave or military deserters, double jeopardy situations, etc. Individual laws enacted by individual governments may address such issues directly, or may act as enabling legislation so that separate visiting forces agreements between a host country and other countries may attain the force of law. Depending on the legislative climate in the host country, such enabling legislation may or may not be necessary. Specific countries Following are some examples of laws relating to visiting forces in various countries: =Antigua and Barbuda= The Visiting Forces Act of 2007 would define the status of foreign forces visiting Antigua and Barbuda). Section 7 of that Act provides that a service court of a visiting force has the primary right to exercise jurisdiction in relation to an alleged commission by a member of the visiting force or a dependent of an offense in respect of (a) the property or security of the designated state; or (b) the person or property of another member of the visiting force or a dependent. This act is presently embodied in a bill is pending enactment. =Australia= The Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963 is an act to make provision with respect to naval, military and air forces of other countries visiting Australia, and for other purposes. Section 6 of this act specifies that it shall be read as a reference to: (a) any country declared by the regulations to be, for the purposes of this Act, a country within the Commonwealth of Nations; and (b) any other country declared under this section to be a country in relation to which that provision has effect. Section 5 of the Defence (Visiting Forces) Regulations 1963 specifies a list of specific countries with reference to which the Visiting Forces Act applies. Section 8 of the Visiting Forces Act specifies that the service tribunals and service authorities of a country in relation to which this section applies may, within Australia, or on board a ship or aircraft belonging to or in the service of the Defence Force or a part of the Defence Force, exercise over persons subject to their jurisdiction in accordance with this section all such powers as are exercisable by them in accordance with the law of that country. =Canada= The Visiting Forces Act (R.S., 1985, c. V-2) provides that the service authorities and service courts of a visiting force may exercise within Canada in relation to members of that force and dependents all the criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction that is conferred on them by the law of the designated state to which they belong. =Germany= The following agreements govern the presence of forces from NATO states stationed in Germany on the basis of an international treaty: * the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) of 19 June 1951 (Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of their Forces, Federal Law Gazette 1961 II p. 1190) * the SOFA Supplementary Agreement of 3 August 1959 (Agreement to Supplement the Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces with respect to Foreign Forces stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany, Federal Law Gazette 1961 II p. 1218) =Malaysia= In Malaysia, Act 432 is the Visiting Forces Act 1960 (Revised 1990). =New Zealand= In 2004, the New Zealand Parliament passed the Visiting Forces Act 2004, updating and replacing the Visiting Forces Act 1939. =Singapore= Singapore's Visiting Forces Act contains provisions for \\"the naval, military and air forces of certain other countries visiting Singapore, and for the apprehension and disposal of deserters or absentees without leave in Singapore from the forces of such countries and for matters connected therewith.\\" =Trinidad and Tobago= In March 2007, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed legislation titled the Visiting Forces Act, 2007. Section 5 of the act extends immunity from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of Trinidad and Tobago in respect of actions taken in the course of their official duties. =United Kingdom= The Visiting Forces (British Commonwealth) Act 1933 was an act to make provision with respect to forces of His Majesty from other parts of the British Commonwealth when visiting the United Kingdom or a colony; with respect to the exercise of command and discipline when forces of His Majesty from different parts of the Commonwealth are serving together; with respect to the attachment of members of one such force to another such force, and with respect to deserters from such forces. During World War II, the Allied Forces Act 1940 enabled visiting Allied forces to conduct courts martial, but did not provide immunity from ordinary criminal law. There was a single exception, as the United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act 1942 gave members of the United States naval and military forces immunity in United Kingdom courts. That remained the position until the aforementioned acts were repealed by the Visiting Forces Act 1952. The Visiting Forces Act 1952 was passed to incorporate the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement into United Kingdom law. SOFA provides a basis for a mutual and reciprocal system of exemptions, immunities and privileges for visiting forces when exercising or stationed in a host country. A major feature of SOFA, which is implemented by the 1952 Act, is the question of jurisdiction for dealing with offences committed by visiting servicemen, civil servants accompanying a force, dependents and contractors. Its main provision is the agreement that the visiting force will retain jurisdiction for its people, which applies equally to United States personnel based in the United Kingdom and British forces serving in NATO countries, Commonwealth countries and, more recently, those countries that have signed up to the NATO partnership for peace. Usually, the service authorities for the visiting force member alleged to have committed an offence and the United Kingdom authorities will be able to agree which jurisdiction is appropriate to deal with the case. If agreement is not reached the decision as to jurisdiction will be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. Where United Kingdom jurisdiction is appropriate the visiting forces case will normally be dealt with locally unless other criteria require the case to be dealt with by Crown Prosecution Service headquarters. Section 1 of the Visiting Forces Act 1952 contains a list of countries to which the act applies. Subsection 2 of Section 1, along with Subsection 2 of Section 15 provide the authority and a means for extending this list. Visiting Forces (Designation) Order 1997 and 1998 extended this list by designation additional countries. Anguilla, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Virgin Islands Statutory Instrument 1990 No. 24 extends the provisions of the British Visiting Forces Act 1952 to these territories. Bermuda Statutory Instrument 2001 No. 3922 extends the provisions of the British Visiting Forces Act 1952 to Bermuda. =Vanuatu= On 14 August 1980, the Republic of Vanuatu enacted the Visiting forces (Agreement) Act. This act gives separate Visiting Forces Agreements with and Papua New Guinea and with the United Kingdom, and specified a protocol for extending those agreements.

He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2000 as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, representing the Manitoba riding of Provencher. Early life and career Iftody was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, with family roots in Lac du Bonnet, Manitoba.David Roberts, \\"Reform's prospects brighten\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 January 1993, A4. He worked at the Manitoba Youth Care Centre from 1977 to 1982, and subsequently received Bachelor of Social Work (1985) and Master of Public Administration (1987) degrees from the University of Manitoba. He later moved to Ottawa, Ontario, where he worked as a management consultant and was owner and president of the firm Animus Research. He also lectured at Carleton University in the Faculty of Law. Member of Parliament Iftody returned to Manitoba to stand as the Liberal candidate for Provencher in the 1993 federal election, and was elected over Reform Party candidate Dean Whiteway. The Liberals won a majority government under Jean Chr√©tien, and Iftody entered parliament as a government backbencher. He was re-elected in the 1997 election against a strong challenge from the Reform Party,The Liberal Party lost all of its other rural Manitoba seats in this election. The election coincided with a major flood in southern Manitoba, and Iftody argued that Chr√©tien should have waited until the waters receded before going to the polls.

The AAT review decisions made by Australian Government ministers, departments and agencies, and in limited circumstances, decisions made by state government and non-government bodies. They also review decisions made under Norfolk Island laws. It is not a court and not part of the Australian court hierarchy; however, its decisions are subject to review by the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. The AAT was established by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 and started operation in 1976. On 1 July 2015, the Migration Review Tribunal, Refugee Review Tribunal and Social Security Appeals Tribunal became divisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Origins The AAT was established by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 and commenced operations on 1 July 1976. On 1 July 2015, the Migration Review Tribunal, Refugee Review Tribunal and Social Security Appeal Tribunal amalgamated with the AAT.  Organisation  The AAT manages their workload in the following divisions: * Freedom of Information Division (FOI Division) * General Division * Migration and Refugee Division * National Disability Insurance Scheme Division (NDIS Division) * Security Division * Small Business Taxation Division * Social Services and Child Support Division * Taxation and Commercial Division, and * Veterans' Appeals Division. Jurisdiction The AAT does not have a general jurisdiction to review administrative decisions. Rather the individual statutes that empower agencies or Ministers to make decisions also grant jurisdiction to the AAT to review the decisions. For example, certain decisions made by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship under the Migration Act 1958 may be subject to merits review in the AAT. The right of review is provided for in the Migration Act itself. The Tribunal is not a court. The High Court has long held that the Australian Constitution, mandates a separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government... Judicial review of administrative decisions takes place in courts, such as the Federal Court and the Federal Circuit Court. The AAT remains part of the executive branch of government. The AAT has jurisdiction to review a number of decisions made under Commonwealth legislation, including in the areas of taxation, immigration, social security, industrial law, corporations and bankruptcy. These decisions may have been made by officials including government ministers, departments, public servants with delegated authority and statutory government bodies. The authority to review administrative decisions is limited to specific areas of government administration where an Act, regulation or other legislative instrument provides for a review by the AAT. The Tribunal has no power to enquire into government decisions generally. More than 400 federal Acts provide for review by the AAT. The Tribunal also has powers to review the decisions of some other Australian tribunals, such as the Veterans' Review Board. The Tribunal has no power to consider the constitutional validity of particular laws or the legality of government decision-making, but only whether decisions made by government officials was made in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements. The AAT's review of government decisions is merit based: it considers whether, on the facts presented to the Tribunal, the correct or preferable decision was made in respect of the applicable law(s) and government procedures.. Hearings are conducted de novo and the AAT is not restricted to the material before the original decision maker in making his decision if new evidence has arisen after the original decision was made. .. Section 43(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act states that the AAT may exercise all the powers and discretions of the original decision maker. It can 'stand in the shoes of the original decision maker' and reconsider the decision using whatever information is brought before it or available to it. Structure The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) consists of the President and the other members who may be appointed as: * Deputy Presidents * Senior Members, or * Members. The President is responsible for the overall management of the Tribunal with the assistance of Division Heads and the Registrar. Staff are employed under the Public Service Act 1999 to assist the AAT to carry out its functions. The President of the AAT must be a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. The AAT's other members may be: * judges of the Federal Court or Family Court of Australia (part-time Deputy Presidents) * lawyers of at least five years' standing, or * persons of relevant knowledge or skills. The current President is Justice David Thomas. Although the President of the AAT must be a judge of the Federal Court, they serve on the AAT in a personal, not judicial, capacity. Members of the Tribunal come from a range of backgrounds and include persons with expertise in accountancy, aviation, engineering, environmental science, law, medicine, pharmacology, military affairs, public administration and taxation. Members of the AAT are appointed by the Governor-General on a full-time or part-time basis. Appointments may be made for a term of up to seven years. Members may be reappointed. Members of the Tribunal who are legally qualified and have 5 years' standing, where authorised to do so, may exercise powers under a number of other Acts. This includes the power to issue telecommunications interception warrants and stored communications warrants under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, issue warrants and exercise related powers under the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 and review certificates that authorise controlled operations under the Crimes Act 1914. Presidential Members and Senior Members who are legally qualified and have 5 years' standing, may be appointed as an approved examiners under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 The President and Deputy Presidents may be appointed as issuing authorities in relation to the making of continued preventative detention orders under the Criminal Code. * See also *Judiciary of Australia *List of Commonwealth courts and tribunals *Fraser Government References External links *Administrative Appeals Tribunal *Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) in Federal Register of Legislation Government of Australia Australian tribunals 1976 establishments in Australia Courts and tribunals established in 1976 ","title":"Administrative Appeals Tribunal"},{"id":"3824054","text":"William Thomas Hillgrove (born November 20, 1940) is an American sports broadcaster, radio personality, and sports journalist. Hillgrove is a notable broadcaster in his hometown of Pittsburgh, and has worked exclusively in that market. He is the lead play-by-play broadcaster for the Pittsburgh Steelers football network (102.5 WDVE) and for the University of Pittsburgh sports network (93.7 The Fan). He calls Pitt football games with Pat Bostick, and Pitt basketball games with former Pitt guard Curtis Aiken. Early life Born William Thomas Hillgrove in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood, he grew up in nearby Garfield. He attended Central Catholic High School and Duquesne University. He worked as a student sports broadcaster for Duquesne basketball games while in college. Hillgrove graduated from Duquesne in 1962 with a degree in journalism. Early career Hillgrove's first job was as a disk jockey with WKJF (now KDKA-FM, known as \\"93.7 The Fan\\"), and in 1968, he joined WTAE-TV as the station's booth announcer. A year later, he swapped jobs with WTAE Radio announcer Del Taylor, wishing to get back into radio. In the mid-1960s, he served for a short period of time as \\"proprietor\\" (the name given to the host) of \\"The Place\\", a television show on WQED (Channel 13) that was a coffee-house style format. In 1969, he was hired as a road game broadcaster for the Pitt Panthers basketball team. The following year, he became the regular color announcer for Pitt football play-by-play man Ed Conway. Following Conway's death in 1974, he assumed the play-by-play announcer duties. Hillgrove was named the sports director for WTAE-TV in 1978 and acted as sports anchor for WTAE News. Pittsburgh Steelers In 1994, Hillgrove was handpicked by Steelers owner Dan Rooney to succeed the retiring Jack Fleming as the play-by-play broadcaster for the Pittsburgh Steelers. After working for many years alongside famous color broadcaster Myron Cope, his Steeler broadcast partners now include former Steelers players like Merrill Hoge (former color), Tunch Ilkin (color), and Craig Wolfley (sideline). He also continues to broadcast Pitt football and basketball games. Former Pittsburgh Pirate Dick Groat serves as Hillgrove's broadcast partner for basketball. His partners for football have been Johnny Sauer (1974-1994), Bill Osborn (1995-2003), Bill Fralic (2004-2010), Pat Bostick (2010-2015). Bill Osborn returned to the booth in 2016 after Bostick stepped down. Other sports Hillgrove has also been a commentator for Pitt football and basketball games. Former Pittsburgh Pirate Dick Groat served as Hillgrove's broadcast partner for basketball until the 2018‚Äì2019 season; former Pitt player Curtis Aiken is now his broadcast partner. His partners for football have been Johnny Sauer (1974‚Äì1994), Bill Osborn (1995‚Äì2003, 2015‚Äì2017), Bill Fralic (2004‚Äì2010), and Pat Bostick (2010‚Äì2015, 2018‚Äìpresent). Awards and recognition He was the 2007 winner of the Chris Schenkel Award, presented by the National Football Foundation, for his work as Pitt's football broadcaster. In July 2012, Hillgrove began hosting a Saturday jazz program presented by the online Pittsburgh Jazz Channel. Personal life Hillgrove married Rosette Sapienza, a vocal music teacher, in 1965. They live in Murrysville, Pennsylvania. The couple have two children and two grandchildren. On June 19, 2020, Hillgrove was charged with driving under the influence for an incident four days earlier. Hillgrove drove a vehicle into the front of a Murrysville grocery store, breaking two windows, and then went inside to fill a prescription. He then returned to the car and drove home, where police later arrived and conducted a breathalyzer test. His blood alcohol content was found to be 0.16, twice the legal limit in Pennsylvania. Hillgrove told officers he \\"had a couple beers\\" and that the \\"car just got away from [him]\\". He subsequently received a two-game suspension from both Steelers and Pitt football broadcasts.

He provides the lead vocals and plays the keyboard for the band. 2-D's singing voice is provided by Blur frontman Damon Albarn on Gorillaz' recordings and performances; his speaking voice was provided by actor Nelson De Freitas in various Gorillaz direct-to-video projects such as Phase One: Celebrity Take Down and Phase Two: Slowboat to Hades. In 2017, Kevin Bishop was cast as the new speaking voice of 2-D. He was created by Albarn and Jamie Hewlett in 1998. Development 2-D was loosely based on a mutual friend of Hewlett and Albarn named Stuart Lowbridge, who has worked as a stage engineer for Damon since the early days of his career, and on Chris Gentry from the Britpop band Menswear. Damon Albarn has claimed that 2-D's singing voice was developed from a vocal effect produced by equipment in his studio that he has said is \\"not Auto-Tune, but it was an early form of synthetic voice\\". Gorillaz engineer Stephen Sedgewick says of the effect, \\"The main lo-fi telephone-like effect is the typical 2-D sound...I can't tell you what it is, but it's done with hardware. The plug-ins on the inserts are a Waves Renaissance De-esser and RVox, and the Waves Kramer PIE [compressor], which I use a lot on vocals.\\" He was originally created as a representation of the \\"classic stupid pretty boy singer\\" stereotype that Hewlett found to be in many bands at the time, and was the first character that Hewlett and Albarn created for Gorillaz in 1998. Albarn has stated that Gorillaz‚Äô sixth studio album The Now Now was \\"very...in the world of 2-D\\" and has often stated the influence that the album‚Äôs backstory in the fictional universe of Gorillaz had on the making of the album and its songwriting process, mentioning that the idea behind the album was to do an album of songs from 2-D's perspective. Fictional history Stuart Pot was born on 23 May 1978 to David and Rachel Pot. The original surname of Stuart's father was \\"Tusspot\\", but he legally changed it to \\"Pot\\", shortly before Stuart was born. His father, David, works as a mechanic and as a fairgrounds worker, while his mother, Rachel, works as a nurse. He was born in Crawley, England and attended St Wilfrid's Catholic School. When he was 11 years old, Stuart was involved in an accident where he fell from a tree and hit his head. This caused all his natural brown hair to shed, until it eventually grew back in a deep azure blue color. The accident also caused him to experience frequent migraines, for which his mother supplied him with painkillers. At age 19, Stuart was hit in the face by Murdoc Niccals when he crashed his Vauxhall Astra into Uncle Norm's Organ Emporium in an attempt to raid the store of its musical equipment. This caused Stuart to receive hyphema in his left eye and put him into a coma. Murdoc was then arrested and sentenced to 3 years of community service, as well as to care for the vegetabilised Stuart for 10 hours a week. Not long after, Murdoc injured Stuart again while pulling off 360 donuts to impress a small crowd of women. Stuart came crashing through the windshield of the car and fractured his other eye. After the incident, he woke up from his vegetative state and was given the nickname \\"2-D\\", which refers to the two dents in his head. 2-D has frequently been depicted as the victim of constant physical and psychological abuse from bandmate Murdoc, although this abuse has mostly stopped in recent years. In the backstory for The Now Now, since Murdoc was in prison and temporarily replaced at the time by the character Ace from Cartoon Network's The Powerpuff Girls, 2-D became the temporary band leader and was in charge of the musical direction of the band for the album. Murdoc's incarceration led 2-D to gain a significant boost in self esteem, to the point of developing an increasing overinflated ego. Immediately after Murdoc's return, 2-D's personality appeared to have returned back to his usual self. Physical appearance 2-D is designed as tall and skinny with large appendages and long limbs, standing at a height of 6'2. He has pale skin and spiky azure blue hair. He is also depicted with a notable lack of visible pupils in his eyes due to the blood leakage from his hyphema. His eyes originally appeared to be pitch black most of the time and occasionally milky white, but since The Now Now, his eyes have been almost exclusively white in all appearances he's made, including Song Machine. His eyes were first depicted as white in the music video for Rockit in 2004. He is also shown to be missing a few front teeth, and has sometimes been shown wearing a golden tooth. Along with the other Gorillaz members, 2-D's wardrobe changes very frequently and he is rarely depicted as wearing the same clothing twice, unlike most other cartoon characters. He has been shown as physically aging somewhat since Gorillaz self-titled debut album in 2001, gaining facial hair, more pronounced wrinkles on his forehead, and a receding hairline over the years. Role in Gorillaz As the frontman of Gorillaz, 2-D's main role in the band is singing lead vocals and playing keyboards. He can play other instruments (as can the other Gorillaz characters), but he generally sticks to his main role as vocalist and keyboardist for most Gorillaz songs. Exceptions to this include the 2018 Gorillaz album The Now Now, where 2-D is often depicted playing guitar, and 2010's The Fall, which 2-D created largely by himself. In most cases, 2-D's singing voice sounds significantly different than his normal speaking voice. His vocal range is very wide, and he has sung everything from baritone to falsetto. Damon Albarn provides all of 2-D's singing voice, including his spoken-word and rapped verses in songs. 2-D apparently has had some influence in the lyric-writing process (as evidenced by the credits on the insert of the titular debut album) even though his intelligence is reputedly negligible. Apparently, Murdoc has been said to have had Albarn occasionally help teach 2-D to sing better than he already could, and apparently even sing in some of their songs, as stated in an NME interview with Albarn. While Murdoc is usually portrayed as the main director behind most Gorillaz albums (or so he claims), 2-D is depicted as the member behind Gorillaz albums such as 2010's The Fall and 2018's The Now Now. 2-D also wrote and recorded Gorillaz' 2017 single Sleeping Powder all by himself, with the music video for the song featuring him exclusively. Other appearances In 2003, 2-D was credited as a guest artist on the songs Small Time Shot Away by Massive Attack, and FM by Nathan Haines. He contributed additional guitar on several tracks on Spacemonkeyz' 2003 Gorillaz remix album Laika Come Home, as well as an additional stylophone solo on the Slow Country remix Strictly Rubbadub. He also recorded vocals for the album's 5/4 remix Lil' Dub Chefin'. It has been claimed by Murdoc in the Gorillaz Are Ten Spotify radio show that the original demo version of the Gorillaz song Dirty Harry called I Need A Gun from Damon Albarn's 2003 solo EP Democrazy is a duet between 2-D and Albarn. In 2001, 2-D became a spokesperson of the Free Tibet campaign after Gorillaz were asked by Adam Yauch of Beastie Boys to work with the organization, appearing in a short commercial for the campaign the same year.See Phase One: Celebrity Take Down, Phase One: Celebrity Takedown On June 15th 2012, an illustration of 2-D was designed by Hewlett in promotion of the Dalai Lama's visit to the UK. In 2017, 2-D appeared in an official advertisement campaign for the English professional football team Chelsea to launch their Chelsea FC Nike football kit with Chelsea player David Luiz. 2-D and the rest of Gorillaz appear on the back cover of Jamie Hewlett's 2017 art book, featured alongside characters from all of Hewlett's projects.

Since his days in the seminal UK Hip Hop group London Posse, Rodney P is widely regarded as the Godfather of British Hip Hop with the London Posse inspiring a whole generation of British emcees and producers by being the first to rap in his authentic London accent and produce a homegrown Hip Hop reggae vibe that is distinctly rooted in the UK. Rodney P has had one of the longest and most respected careers in UK hip hop. History In 1986, The London Posse were invited by Mick Jones of The Clash to support his new band Big Audio Dynamite on a UK tour. After a life- changing trip to New York and a second UK tour, a recording contract with Big Life Records followed and the recording of the pioneering Hip Hop songs \\"Live Like The Other Half\\" and \\"Money Mad\\" taken from the debut and only album Gangsta Chronicle. Gangsta Chronicle was voted the Most Important UK Hip Hop Album of All Time in the 2007 poll of renowned music magazine Hip Hop Connection. With London Posse coming to an end, the decision to guard his creative control led to the birth of his own label record Riddim Killa, a collaboration with Low Life Records, one of the leading labels of the rapidly growing scene. As a label owner of Riddim Killa Records, Rodney P released a series of popular singles including \\"Big Tings\\" and the anthem Riddim Killa. Then in 2003, he released, to critical acclaim, his own long-awaited solo album \\"The Future\\" which included the Hip-Hop reggae classic \\"The Nice Up\\". Continuing to build on the Riddim Killa Records brand in 2007 Rodney released the debut album ‚ÄúLion Heart - Tussle with the Beast‚Äù by the then undisputed king of underground UK Hip-Hop scene Klashnekoff. Rodney P signed to Tru Thoughts Records in 2011. A collaborative album with Zed Bias and Falacy was released in 2012 under the name Sleepin Giantz. One look at Rodney P's discography illustrates a who's who of the UK music scene collaborating with fellow UK Hip Hop heavyweights, Skinnyman, Blak Twang, Roots Manuva and The Nextmen to name a few, as well as featuring on various soul and R&B; productions with artists such as Omar, Terri Walker and The Brand New Heavies and on Dance and Electro tracks with MJ Cole, Mercury Award-winning Roni Size, The Stanton Warriors, Timo Maas and French Hip Hop Reggae outfit L‚ÄôEntourloop. More unusual affiliations with artists Bjork and Nitin Sawhey demonstrate Rodney P's role as a genre-defying emcee as well as reflecting his own diverse musical taste. Radio Shortly after setting up Riddim Killa Records In 2002, Rodney P, along with friend and collaborator DJ Skitz, was invited by the BBC to host ‚ÄúThe Original Fever‚Äù a groundbreaking Urban music show on the then newly formed digital station BBC Radio 1Xtra. He was introduced to DJ Skitz by a mutual friend 'Destiny 'who worked at the legendary Deal Real record shop in the West End of London, and appears on Skitz's albums Countryman and Homegrown volume 1. Their show \\"The Original Fever\\" ran for over 6 years and saw Rodney & Skitz interviewing some of the biggest names in music including Pharrell Williams, P Diddy, 50 Cent and Kanye West. This development in his career and a love of the medium led to even more involvement in radio documentaries. He has since gone on to present topical documentaries including the Sony Award-nominated \\"F.E.D.S\\", ‚ÄúConcrete Heat‚Äù and the Lamacq Live documentary: \\"The Beautiful Struggle\\", which saw him returning to war-torn Sierra Leone, after first visiting in 1993 as part of London Posse, to report on the burgeoning indigenous Hip Hop culture. TV/Film Highly regarded as a spokesperson for the UK music scene Rodney P is often asked to contribute to televised discussions, sharing his knowledge and opinion on many topics; this has led to numerous appearances on television shows like \\"Trevor Nelsons\\" The Low Down, Don Letts's 2007 3 part soul music anthology Soul Britannia and The Mercury Prize Award Ceremony. He has also appeared in many TV documentaries including ‚ÄúHow Hip Hop Changed the World‚Äù hosted by Idris Elba and ‚ÄúLife of Rhyme‚Äù hosted by Akala both produced by Acme Films. Rodney received a great deal of exposure on Channel 4's Dub Plate Drama featuring alongside UK artists Shystie, Ms Dynamite, N Dubs and Big Nasty in the world's first viewer-led interactive television drama. This inner city Soup Opera sees Rodney P summarizing the events of each series and enticing public opinion and decision. In 2011, he provided the voice of the animated rapper in a television advert for the Toyota Yaris. In 2016 Rodney presented \\"The Hip Hop World News\\" a 90-minute authored film by Acme Films for BBC Four in which Rodney set out to show what the World looks like through the lens of Hip Hop interviewing Hip Hop icons like Russell Simmons, Rakim and \\"Chuck D\\" of Public Enemy. In 2017 Rodney followed up The Hip Hop World News with the Award-nominated \\"The Last Pirates - Britains Rebel DJ‚Äôs\\" also for BBC Four. \\"Presented by Rodney P, this film presents an alternative history of Britain in the 1980s - with archive and music that celebrates a very different side of Thatcher's Britain.‚Äù In 2020 Rodney P presented \\"Rodney P's Jazz Funk\\" on BBC Four, a one-hour exploration of the jazz-funk movement, one of the first black British music cultures. Live Constantly in demand as a live performer Rodney P has performed to audiences across the Globe. Fans in Europe, China, Japan, Australia, America, and numerous countries across Africa have enjoyed the distinctive live style and party-inducing performances of one of the UK's finest. Over the last few years, Rodney has toured with The Dub Pistols performing to huge audiences around the World as well as maintaining his partnership with DJ Skitz. Rodney and Skitz along with and a handful of other acts including The Gentlemen's Dub Club and The Boxettes joined forces with Chai Wallahs, the ethical and unique venue space that seeks to provide an alternative experience and a platform for fresh creative expression, and performed at festival across the UK including, Bestival, The Secret Garden and Glastonbury. As a host, Rodney P has taken the helm of a wide range of events. Notable live appearances include the MF Prince's Trust Concert with Jay-Z and Alicia Keys and the United Nations-sponsored UNHabitat Charity Concert alongside Jazzy Jeff, Dead Prez and Mos Def, as well as regular appearances at London's legendary Fabric Live.

White is known predominantly for his work on natural hazards, particularly flooding, and the importance of sound water management in contemporary society.  Background  White was raised in Chicago in the Hyde Park neighborhood, and spent summers in the Tongue River Valley of Wyoming, before studying at the University of Chicago, where he earned his B.S. in 1932 and his PhD in 1942 (published 1945). From 1946 to 1955 he was President of Haverford College. He then returned to Chicago as a Professor of Geography, where he was the central figure in the \\"Chicago school\\" of natural hazards research. In 1970, he moved to the University of Colorado, before retiring after ten years there. Having published his first paper in 1935, he was still publishing into his 90s (Wescoat and White, 2003). White was motivated by his Quaker faith to do research beneficial to humanity. As a conscientious objector to World War II, from 1942 to 1946 he served with the American Friends Service Committee aiding war refugees in France, and was briefly interned by the Nazis at Baden-Baden. He continued to serve as a leader in various Quaker service organizations for much of his life. He was also heavily involved in applying his research to reform flooding and water policy in the United States and the Middle East. In 1944, White married Anne Underwood, with whom he would have three children (Will, Mary, and Frances). Anne collaborated with Gilbert in his research until her death in 1989. Gilbert remarried in 2003 to Claire Sheridan. Scholarly contributions White's main contributions to society and to scholarship have been classified by Kates (2011) as follows: *How to bring safe water to all the world's people as a human right *How to reduce significantly the global toll of hazard deaths and damages *How to facilitate peace, through joint water development and management *How to make geography (in particular) and science (in general) more useful to the world *How to enable people to coexist with nature and develop sustainably. Some of White's most notable work involved the identification and classification of adjustment mechanisms for flooding in the United States, perceptions of natural hazards, and choice of natural hazard adjustments (Hinshaw, 2006). White identified adjustments to flooding as being either structural or non-structural. He advocated, where feasible, adaptation to or accommodation of flood hazards rather than the \\"structural\\" solutions (dams, levees, and floodwalls, for example) that dominated policy in the early 20th century. Structural adjustments, developed by engineers, are designed to modify flooding hazards so that humans are protected and can continue to live in areas that are periodically subject to flooding (floodplains). White's non- structural adjustments consist of arrangements imposed by a governing body (local, regional, or national) to restrict the use of floodplains, or flexible human adjustments to flood risk that do not involve substantial investment in flood controls (Tobin and Montz, 1997). In his influential dissertation entitled \\"Human adjustment to floods,\\" published in 1945 by the University of Chicago Department of Geography, White argued that an overreliance on structural works in the United States had actually increased damage by flooding, rather than decreasing them. He argued famously in this work ‚Äì deemed by several commentators to be the most important contribution made by a geographer in 20th-century North America (Hinshaw 2006, Kates 2007) ‚Äì that \\"Floods are an act of God, but flood losses are largely an act of man\\". Public confidence in structural works increased occupance of, and building on floodplains. Design standards are sometimes inappropriate, and overconfidence develops, resulting in worse disasters if a flood breaches defences. A recent and relevant example of the impacts of undue confidence in structural works can be seen in Hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans, during the summer of 2005. Historically, at least in the US, works were built to certain design specifications (for example, the 100-year flood, or 1% flood). In instances where the design specifications were exceeded (in the case of a 150-year flood, etc.), they failed, thus causing catastrophic loss in overdeveloped floodplains (White et al., 1958). White worked under President Johnson in committees that advised the establishment of the National Flood Insurance Program ‚Äì although he was not happy when his cautions were ignored and the NFIP was rolled out too quickly. White also made major contributions to the human occupance of arid lands and the management problems of such settlements, campaigned on the dangers of nuclear weapons, and sat on many committees dealing with water management in developing countries. He oversaw informal brokering of water management conflicts in the Middle East. Gilbert F. White, along with his former students and colleagues including Robert Kates and Ian Burton, have become some of the most influential scholars of natural and technological hazards.

Biography  Z√∫√±iga was born 1755 in Cuautitl√°n, near Mexico City, to Spanish parents. He enlisted on October 18, 1772 as an officer trainee in the frontier army. He initially served on the Texas frontier. In 1780 he was promoted to lieutenant while stationed at the Presidio of San Carlos de Cerro Gordo, in the remote Big Bend Country. In 1781 Lt. Z√∫√±iga led his troops to Mission San Gabriel. He became Commandant of the Presidio of San Diego on September 8, 1781 and served in that post 12 years, until October 19, 1793. While there, he had cordial relations with his men, the Indians, his superiors, and missionaries. In 1782 Z√∫√±iga laid a road from San Diego Bay to the presidio. That same year he also built the Presidio chapel. He was its carpenter, mason, and painter for the chapel. He also ordered a statue of the Immaculate Conception (which is now at Mission San Luis Rey). In a letter to his mother in Mexico City, he proudly described the chapel and sent money to purchase \\"carmine, vermillion and other painting materials\\", garden and flower seeds, and to send any Dramas she can spare to read. In 1784, Z√∫√±iga became a member of the third order of Franciscans. Z√∫√±iga had a reputation for honesty. He also served as quartermaster/paymaster and his books were always in order. He found a deficit in the books for $7000. The previous quartermaster/paymaster, Rafael Pedro y Gil, was arrested and sent to San Blas, Nayarit. On May 19, 1792 Z√∫√±iga was promoted to captain and assigned to the Presidio of Tucson, but had to wait until 1793 until his successor for San Diego arrived. After detached duty in Monterey, Z√º√±iga arrived in Tucson in 1794. Z√∫√±iga blazed a trail between Tucson and the Zuni pueblos in 1795, but Apache hostilities prevented that route from becoming well-traveled. During 1804-1806 Z√∫√±iga was the commander at Tucson. He later served at Arizpe, and retired as lieutenant colonel and Adjutant Inspector of Presidios. Z√º√±iga had at least two sons. His son Ignacio was born in 1796 in Tucson. He had a previous son born 1783 as the result of an affair with Teresa Morillo, wife of an enlisted man, Manuel Nieto.

It contains .Martine, John, Fourteen Parishes of the County of Haddington, Edinburgh, 1890, p.44. Dirleton lies between North Berwick (east), Gullane (west), Fenton Barns (south) and the Yellowcraigs nature reserve, Archerfield Estate and the Firth of Forth (north). Gullane parish was joined to Dirleton parish in 1612 by an Act of Parliament because \\"Golyn (as it was anciently spelt) is ane decaying toun, and Dirleton is ane thriven place.\\"Martine (1890) p.52. Locale Dirleton has two hotels, The Castle Inn which looks on to the village green and The Open Arms Hotel. Other visitor attractions today include the Dirleton Gallery, Archerfield Links recently built with two 18-hole golf courses and hotel. The church (presumably built soon after the move of the parish in 1612) and manse (1708) of Dirleton stand immediately to the north of the village in a beautiful situation. The church has extensive Victorian renovations (1836 including the ornate tower), and a churchyard.Martine (1890) p.46. it has a population of about 3300. The churchyard contains an odd stone of 1746 to a George Seton, including two stern-faced mermaid caryatids. The school is by John Alexander Carfrae (1910) who built many Edinburgh schools. Trinitarian friars had a friary here prior to the reformation.  Two Weeks in September  The 1967 British-French film Two Weeks in September ( √Ä c≈ìur joie) was partly filmed in the area. The film starred Brigitte Bardot and Laurent Terzieff and was directed by Serge Bourguignon. Scenes for the film were shot on location in Dirleton Castle and on the beach at Gullane in September 1966. The principal cast stayed at the Open Arms Hotel in Dirleton. Castle Dirleton is notable for Dirleton Castle, a well-preserved medieval fortress, which today belongs to Historic Scotland. It is the caput of the feudal barony of Dirleton, said to be one of the oldest in Scotland (This barony did not, however, cover the entire parish). It was built in the middle of the twelfth century by a branch of the Anglo-Norman family of De Vaux, a family with its origins in Rouen, Normandy, which had settled at Dirleton during the reign of King Malcolm IV (1153‚Äì1165). They also held the manor of Golyn (Gullane) and parts of the lands of Fenton. In 1225 it is described as a \\"castellum\\".Buildings of Scotland;Lothian by Colin McWilliam In 1298 when King Edward I of England invaded Scotland, no place was able to resist him except Dirleton castle. After a resolute resistance it surrendered to forces under Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham. It was still in English possession in 1306. When Cromwell invaded Scotland in 1650 the castle was, after a gallant defence, taken by Lambert and by him partially dismantled and reduced to its present ruinous state.Martine (1890) p.45-47. The heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton, brought the barony and estates to her husband, Sir John de Haliburton, about 1430. Their grandson, Sir Walter de Haliburton, High Treasurer of Scotland, was created a Lord of Parliament in 1447. This family failed in the male line and an heiress took Dirleton to her husband, Lord Ruthven, grandfather of the Earl of Gowrie who was forfeited in 1600.Martine (1890) p.47. The barony then graduated to a number of proprietors during the corrupt 17th century. Finally, Sir John Nisbet, Lord Dirleton (d. 1688), a Senator of the College of Justice acquired it in 1663 and the barony remained with this family into the 20th century. In 1923 the Nisbet family donated the castle to Historic Scotland. In the late 20th century this feudal barony was purchased by one Patrick Hannigan, from Savaldor in Brazil, who subsequently bequeathed the barony to the present baron of Dirleton, Camilo Agasim-Pereira of Fulwood and Dirleton. He was later confirmed as such by disposition recorded in the Land Register of Scotland on April 22, 2002. Since the Abolition of Feudal Tenure, etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, which abolished feudal dues and the legal jurisdiction of the Baron, all Baronies have now been separated from the caput (or Land), but this has not affected the dignity of Baron. The site of the Barony of Dirleton today is Lamb island which was owned by the Barony of Fulwood Trust and then in 2009 was sold to Uri Geller. Congalton The feudal barony of Congalton gave its name (or vice versa) to a very ancient family that subsisted in a part of Dirleton parish for twenty generations in the male line. The first on record, Robert de Congaltoun, witnessed a charter of Richard de Morville, Constable of Scotland, circa 1162. However, whether or not the family were then the lairds is called into question by the burial at North Berwick in May 1311 of Sir Robert de Lawedre (Lauder), where the inscription stated: \\"here lies the good Robert Lauedre the greate Laird of Congaltoun and The Bass Maii MCCCXI\\".Nisbet, Alexander, Systems of Heraldry, Edinburgh, 1722, p.443. Sir John de Congaltoun of that Ilk appears to be in possession as laird just a few years later when he recorded a mortification dated December 13, 1314.Douglas, Sir Robert, The Baronage of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1773, p.521 . The elder branch of the family succeeded through heiresses to the estates of Hepburn of Keith, in Humbie parish, and Riccart of Riccarton, in Kincardineshire. Robert Hepburn Congalton of Keith and Congalton, the 18th generation of the family, sold Congalton to his brother who became Charles Congalton of that Ilk (died January 1742) and in 1702 had married Janet Lauder (1671‚Äì1751), daughter of Sir John Lauder, Lord Fountainhall. Their son William Congalton of that Ilk (died 27 October 1753), who married secondly Mary Bethune (died 1751), daughter of David Bethune, 17th of Balfour, had ten childrenDouglas, Sir Robert, The Baronage of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1773, p.523 .Burke, Sir Bernard, Ulster King of Arms, Burke's Landed Gentry, 9th edition, London, 1898, vol.1, p.717.Grant, Francis J., W.S., Lyon Clerk and Keeper of the Records, Index to Genealogies, Birthbriefs, and Funeral Escutcheons, Edinburgh, 1908, p.11. of whom only three married.

A younger son Andrew Congalton (1749-1823), also a Captain in the Royal Navy, had a son Charles Congalton who died unmarried in 1827, so ending the male line.John Burke 'A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland Enjoying Territorial Possessions Or High Official Rank: But Uninvested with Heritable Honours' Colburn, 1836 Volume 3, p381 https://books.google.co.uk/ Retrieved 11 November 2015 Islands Three islands, Fidra, Ibris, and the Lamb, belong to the parish of Dirleton. Fidra is the largest, directly opposite the village, and a mile from the shore. Upon it there was once the castle of Tarbet, a possession of the Congalton family. There was also here St. Nicholas's Priory, dating from 1165, the ruins of which still exist. The monks had a ferry from the island to the mainland, from which the farm of Ferrygate takes its name.Martine (1890) p.50-51. Elbottle A Saxon word signifying \\"the old dwelling\\", Elbottle is also within Dirleton parish. Near Archerfield House there was a convent of Cistercian nuns, probably in connection with the large Cistercian nunnery at North Berwick.Martine (1890) p.51. The Lauder family held lands here also. James Lauder (d. 1631), a great-great-grandson of Robert Lauder of The Bass (d.

Transactions of the East Lothian Antiquarian and Field Naturalists Society. XXVII, 117-130 In the early 1940s it was a site for mobile control and aerial trailers, but because of the continued incursion of night raiders more sophisticated equipment was required to direct friendly fighter aircraft to the enemy and the earlier Chain Home radar network needed to be augmented. The latter was designed to detect incoming waves of German aircraft during daylight and direct British fighters to a point where they could make visual contact (i.e. within a mile or so). In darkness, however, central command had to direct night fighters to within hundreds of metres in order to engage the enemy and the station at Dirleton was constructed as part of a system designed to provide this level of accuracy and control. The main operations block, often called a Happidrome, was the hub of the complex and it was from here that underground cables ran to the various transmitters and receivers in the surrounding areas. These included height finding equipment, plan and position indicators and machinery for the identification of friend and foe signals sent by incoming aircraft. The information obtained was collated in the operations room and relayed to the fighter stations at Drem and the training unit at Charterhall. Although staff were not billeted at the station it was largely self-sufficient with its own water supply, sewage treatment plant, generator house and telephone exchange. Welfare facilities included canteens, showers and rest rooms. It is clear that in times of emergency the site could have carried on independently of the national grid and, with the blast doors closed and air filtration unit functioning, it could have survived all but the most direct of hits from enemy planes. In its later life it passed over many of its main functions to other centres but it continued as a training venue until the 1950s. Prior to development of the site a full survey was undertaken by Headland Archaeology and archived at the National Monuments Record of Scotland,http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/pls/portal/canmore.newcandig_details_gis?inumlink=121938 it is now a private home.

Early life and education  Sheikh Salem is the eldest son of Sheikh Ali Salem Al-Mubarak Al- Sabah (1898‚Äì1928) and was born in Fraij Al-Shuyouk () in the designated area of Wast ().  Career  = Construction and development (1950‚Äì1960) = Sheikh Salem debuted his career in the construction and development of the country during the discovery of oil in the 1950s; through its monetary revenue, Kuwait started to witness and experience an industrial growth on all levels around the country. Since then, Salem enlisted in the general public work sector, well before the forming of the Government of Kuwait, partaking and leading many development projects roles that were designed to build contemporary Kuwait in addition to setting the corps foundations of lifestyle and way of life in contemporary society today. During the early 1950s, Sheikh Salem worked closely with Sheikh Fahed Salem Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah, Director of Public Works and the Municipality. He assumed the role of deputy director of His Excellency's offices for the both until 1959. During the same year, Salem headed the construction council and was in charge of planning and development, a very important post during the developing period of Kuwait.

Signs may include intellectual disability, short height, low-set ears, decreased muscle tone, and developmental delay. Complications may include congenital heart disease. The condition is due to problems during the formation of the reproductive cells in a person's parents. Risk factors include older parents at the time of conception. Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by chromosomal analysis. Treatment is based on symptoms. The condition is extremely rare, with less than forty reported cases as of 2011. The condition was first described in 1963. Signs and symptoms The main characteristics of pentasomy X are intellectual disability, short stature and craniofacial abnormalities. Other physical traits include the following: * Small head * Ear abnormalities * Widely spaced eyes with upward slanting palpebral fissures and epicanthal folds * Short neck * Broad nose with a depressed nasal bridge * Hyperextension of the elbows * Dental abnormalities and cleft palate * Clinodactyly of the fifth finger * Deformities of the feet * Heart defects Causes The aneuploidy is thought to be caused by problems occurring during meiosis, either in the mother or in both the mother and father. Successive nondisjunctions have been observed in the mother of at least one patient. The features of the syndrome likely arise due to failure of X-inactivation and the presence of multiple X chromosomes from the same parent causing problems with parental imprinting. In theory, X-inactivation should occur and leave only one X chromosome active in each cell. However, failure of this process has been observed in one individual studied. The reason for this is thought to be the presence of an unusually large, and imbalanced, number of X chromosomes interfering with the process.

He has been the Apostolic Administrator of Joliet, Illinois, since December 2019. Biography =Early life= The youngest of three sons, Richard Pates was born to Donald and Lenora Pates in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He attended Nazareth Hall Seminary and St. Paul Seminary, from where he earned Bachelor of Arts degrees in Philosophy and Latin in 1965. He completed his graduate studies in Rome, where he resided at the Pontifical North American College and received a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University. On December 20, 1968, Pates was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Francis Reh at St. Peter's Basilica. =Early priesthood= Upon his return to the Twin Cities, he served as associate pastor at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in St. Paul from 1969 to 1970. From 1970 to 1974, he was the vocation director of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis and a weekend associate pastor at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis. He also served as private secretary to Archbishop Leo Byrne and vice-chancellor of the Archdiocese from 1973 to 1975. =Senior priestly postings= From 1975 to 1981, Pates was secretary of the Apostolic Delegation to the United States in Washington, D.C..

Founded on March 22, 2002 by the liberal MEP Ward Beysen (1941-2005) as a secession of the VLD, mostly in Antwerp. The Liberaal App√®l was first a movement, then became a full-fledged political party on January 20, 2003. It took part, with a limited number of votes (less than 0,5%) under the 5% electoral threshold, at the May 2003 federal elections. On January 14, 2005, Ward Beysen committed suicide, an event that created doubts over the party's future. There were meetings in the following months between the leadership of Liberaal App√®l and another VLD-dissenter, Hugo Coveliers, but to no effect, as Coveliers finally announced his own party VLOTT to break the cordon sanitaire around the Vlaams Belang. On November 7, 2005 the party's leader, Jacques Kerremans, met his VLD counterpart Bart Somers in view of an electoral cartel for the municipal elections of October 8, 2006, and the reintegration of Liberaal App√®l into the VLD began at the local level. On February 2, 2007 the party's leader announced that his party will participate at the open alliance of VLD / VIVANT for the general election of June 2007.

It is used in a drill. Hole saws typically have a pilot drill bit (arbor) at their center to keep the saw teeth from walking. The fact that a hole saw creates the hole without needing to cut up the core often makes it preferable to twist drills or spade drills for relatively large holes (especially those larger than ). The same hole can be made faster and using less power. The depth to which a hole saw can cut is limited by the depth of its cup-like shape. Most hole saws have a fairly short aspect ratio of diameter to depth, and they are used to cut through relatively thin workpieces. However, longer aspect ratios are available for applications that warrant them. Cutting with a hole saw is analogous to some machining operations, called trepanning in the trade, that swing a cutter analogous to a fly cutter in order to achieve a similar result of annular kerf and intact core. Construction The saw consists of a metal cylinder, usually steel, mounted on an arbor. The cutting edge either has saw teeth formed in it or industrial diamonds embedded in it. The arbor can carry a drill bit to bore a centering hole. After the first few millimeters of cut, the centering mechanism may no longer be needed, although it will help the bit to bore without wandering in a deep hole. The sloping slots in the cylinder wall help carry the dust out. The kerf of the cut is designed to be slightly larger than the diameter of the rest of the hole saw so that it does not get jammed in the hole. Holes saws for use with portable drills are commonly available in diameters from 6 to 130 mm, or in the US, ¬º to 6 inches. The only limit on the length of the cylinder, and thus depth of the hole, is the need to remove the bit from the hole to clear dust. A cylinder length is not uncommon, although shorter bits are usual. By breaking the core off from time to time and using a shank extension, a diamond core drill can drill to depths many times its length. Saw teeth are used for most materials, such as wood, plastic, soft plaster, and metal. Diamond hole saws are used to bore holes in brick, concrete, glass, and stone. Types =Adjustable= Adjustable hole saw An adjustable hole saw consists of a number of thin metal saw blade-like strips, and a flat disc with a large number of grooves in one side and a shank on the other. By snapping the blades into different grooves on the disc, a hole saw of a wide variety of sizes can be constructed. =Circle cutter= Hole saw circle cutter Another type of adjustable hole saw, also called a circle cutter, is formed by having one, two, or three adjustable teeth on a platform with a pilot bit. To cut out a hole of any size, the teeth need only be adjusted to the proper position. This type is available in sizes up to a foot and larger, and can be used to accurately cut large circles. Advantages and disadvantages The main advantage over conventional drill bits is the hole saw's efficiency, because very little of the total material being removed is actually cut, which ultimately reduces the overall power requirement. Another advantage over drill bits is the wider size capability. For example, a hole would require a huge twist drill or spade drill, unable to be properly driven by a pistol-grip drill or benchtop drill press; but it can be cut with a hole saw with relative ease. Some disadvantages include: * The portable drill used must be capable of producing considerable torque at low speed * They tend to bind if choked with dust, or if allowed to wander away from the central axis of the planned hole * The kick-back from a powerful drill may be severe under some conditions, and long side-handles should be used, preferably with two operators for very large holes. * The core plug often binds inside the hole saw, and often must be pried out after each hole is cut. Sometimes the prying is quite difficult. * Sometimes the core plug will twist apart mid-cut, creating a condition where the core inside the hole saw spins on the yet-uncut portion of the core still in the workpiece. This tends to stop the cutting action of the saw, and if the workpiece is wood or plastic, the friction will start to singe it, creating a burning smell and heating up the hole saw. The twisted-off core must then be pried out of the hole saw before the cutting can continue. Diamond drilling Diamond hole saws are also called diamond core drill bits. Laser welded diamond core drill bits can be used in wet and dry drilling, but not all materials to be drilled are suitable for dry drilling. Very hard materials like reinforced concrete normally should be drilled with water, otherwise the excessive heat generated during the drilling process may cause the diamonds on the core bit to become blunt, and then lead to poor drilling performance. The bond materials welded diamond core drill bits usually are specially adjusted to fit the wet and dry drillings respectively. This can make the core bits perform better in drilling speed and/or lifespan. Diamond hole saws will drill through tile, porcelain tiles, granite, marble, concrete, metals and any lapidary material.

They did not acquire their NC classification until the publicly owned New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) purchased the WMR and its locomotive fleet. The first member of the NC class was ordered in 1901 and entered service in May 1902 as WMR No. 5. Another locomotive built to a very similar design was ordered in 1904 and entered service that same year as WMR No. 18. When the locomotives passed into NZR ownership in 1908, they were considered to be similar enough to be classified together, and while they also bore strong similarities to the members of the N class, they were sufficiently different that a separate classification of NC was used. Their main distinguishing feature was a wider firebox. They were Vauclain compound locomotives. The two engines served NZR for just over two decades. No. 18, now NC 462, was retired in September 1928, while No. 5, now NC 461, remained in service until March 1931. Their final region of operation is believed to be the Wairarapa, and they are known to have worked the line from the Hutt Valley up the western slope of the Rimutaka Range to the western end of the Rimutaka Incline. Together with OB 455 (ex-WMR No. 11) and UD 465 (ex-WMR No. 20), NC 461 was one of the last surviving locomotives of WMR heritage. All three were withdrawn in March 1931.

Brackstone played regularly for the reserves but broke his leg during the 2002‚Äì03 season. However, he recovered and impressed the then manager Neale Cooper enough to give him an opportunity in the first team, his debut being against Blackpool in 2003.

Despite being a fringe first team player, Brackstone was allowed to take part in the youth team that won the Dallas Cup in 2004. However, in 2004, in-growing toenail problems and Glandular Fever disrupted Brackstone's season and he has struggled to establish himself as a regular first team player. He was released in May 2007. In the same month, Darlington manager, Dave Penney, signed Brackstone on a free transfer. After one season at Darlington, Brackstone was released and signed for Gateshead on 30 May 2008.

He served as the Foreign Minister of Bolivia from 23 January 2006Chileans Rule Out Sea Access Talks with Bolivia Angus Reid Consultants to 23 January 2017. He was designated the Secretary General of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) in March 2017, a position which he held until November 2019. Early life Choquehuanca was born in Cota Cota Baja, a small village bordering Lake Titicaca near Huarina in the La Paz Department of Bolivia. Choquehuanca learned to speak Aymara as his first language, and later learned Spanish as well (around age 7). In 1971, Choquehuanca moved to nearby Huarina to continue his secondary studies. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1980 from Jos√© Miguel Lanza General College. Choquehuanca first met future president Evo Morales at a trade union congress in 1984. In 1990 he completed a postgraduate degree in history and anthropology at the Higher University of San Andr√©s in La Paz. Between 2001 and 2002 he completed a higher diploma in the Rights of Indigenous Peoples at Cordillera University. Career Choquehuanca, who is of Aymara descent, is an activist in the Aymara indigenous and campesino movement. Starting in the 1980s, he worked in support of the Unified Syndical Confederation of Rural Workers of Bolivia, through various political actions, trainings, and congresses.\\"Estaba presente en los bloqueos de caminos, huelgas de hambre, movilizaciones sociales, talleres de capacitaci√≥n, ampliados y congresos de las organizaciones del movimiento popular.\\" From 1998 to 2005, he worked as National Coordinator of the Programa Nina (meaning fire in Aymara), an NGO consortium that provides training to rural movement leaders. He has worked with international agencies and has been an advisor to President Evo Morales, a fellow Aymara, since before Morales's election to the Presidency. He was considered one of the most important ministers of Morales at the time. He and Luis Arce, Minister of Economy and Finance, were the only people to serve in their cabinet posts for over a decade during Evo Morales' presidency. Observers have described Choquehuanca as the leader of a pachamamista or indigenista faction within the cabinet, counterpoised to the pragmatic developmentalism of Arce and Vice President √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera. He supports an own (indigenous) way of development and does not favor the development that he hears in international summits. In January 2020, was announced as the candidate for the Vice-Presidency for the presidential elections in May. But the presidential election was postponed twice due to the Covid19 pandemic. and rescheduled to be held in October 2020. In October 19, 2020, he and Luis Arce were announced as the winners in the elections by the interim president Jeanine A√±ez, but they have not yet taken up office.  Interaction with 2011 indigenous march  Choquehuanca visited the Eighth Grand National Indigenous March twice on behalf of the government. On September 14 and 15, he conveyed the message that \\"We cannot change what the president has already decided\\" at the beginning of a long but fruitless dialogue with leaders of CIDOB and the Subcentral TIPNIS. From September 15, the march was blockaded from advancing by a crowd of some 200 campesino and colonizers' union members at the San Lorenzo bridge of Yucumo. Between the two protests, police set up a their own blockade, preventing the march from advancing. On the morning of September 24, Choquehuanca returned to the indigenous march. Again negotiations with the march leadership were inconclusive. A group of female marchers grabbed Choquehuanca and led him marching down the highway in an effort to circumvent the police blockade. At the police blockade, a tense standoff escalated into a brief confrontation, but the marchers succeeded in passing the police line. Several government officials, including Minister of Interior Sacha Llorenti and Minister of Transparency Nardi Suxo, said that this was a \\"kidnapping\\" (secuestro), but Choquehuanca steadfastly refused to label it as such saying that \\"the sisters and [female] comrades grabbed me, surely they had thought that they would pass that police encirclement with the Chancellor; I was not insulted, nor mistreated, but yes, they obliged me to walk.\\"\\"Las hermanas y compa√±eras me agarraron, seguramente han pensado que pasar√≠an con el canciller ese cerco policial, no he recibido insultos, no me maltratan pero si me obligan a caminar.\\" La Paz Prosecutor Patricia Santos, who was investigating the events, received Choquehuanca's testimony to this effect on 21 November. In February 2012, the Prosecutor's Office subpoenaed twenty-six leaders of the indigenous movement and its allies to testify in an investigation of the incident as an alleged homicide. Former human rights ombudsman Waldo Albarrac√≠n has described the charges of kidnapping and attempted homicide as without merit.

It was created by British developer Glyn Williams in 1989. The game takes place during a war between the alien forces of Sirius and the humans of Earth. The player fights for the Earth forces. The game is played as sequential missions. Completing a mission successfully lets the player advance to the next mission. It is possible to save the game status after each mission, but not during a mission. Typical mission objectives include intelligence gathering, search and rescue missions, destroying enemies and protecting friendly forces. The player is sent for missions from the SolBase, a military base orbiting the Sun. The player must travel to different solar systems using a device that allows faster than light travel through quad- space, which is a form of hyperspace. Warhead spawned a spiritual sequel, XF5700 Mantis. Story The story takes place in a fight between the alien forces of Sirius and the humans of Earth. The player has been enrolled as a fighter pilot for the Fist-of-Earth space force. The player is led to know that the forces of Sirius have attacked humans for an unknown reason. The player knows the following: The enemy are an insect-like species from the star system Sirius. It is suspected that their present evolutionary form was achieved at the time there were Dinosaurs on Earth. It is also theorised that insects on Earth and Sirius share a same ancestor. The Sirians operate as a group-minds of groups of tens or maybe hundreds of insects. As individuals the Sirians are not intelligent, but their intelligence comes from combining together in large groups. It is argued that their civilization acts as a single entity. The group-mind is based on radio communication that is a natural property of the metallic parts in their bodies. It is speculated that spaceship manufacturing technology is relatively new for the Sirians and that the first Sirian vessel was launched in 1897 from Sirius Five. The Earth was attacked in the year 2045 by the Sirian fleet. The invasion lead to a planetary winter and 3 thousand million casualties and in following years a third of the Earth population died as a consequence. The attack lead to political unity and the dissolution of national borders on Earth. The organisation called the Fist of Earth was formed to defend the Earth. The most important military base called SolBase was built in Earth orbit. When the SolBase became operational it was moved to orbit the Sun to a position that was thought to be a best place to defend the whole solar system.

He is the patron saint for persons suffering from cancer, AIDS, or other illness. Life Peregrine Laziosi was born in 1260, the only son of an affluent family in Forl√¨, in northern Italy. At that time Forli was part of the Papal States. Peregrine's family supported the anti-papal faction. In 1283 the residents of Forl√¨ were under interdict. St. Philip Benizi, Prior General of the Friar Servants of Saint Mary, was sent to try to reconcile the divided community. While trying to preach in Forl√¨, Philip was heckled and struck by the 18-year-old Peregrine. He was driven from the city with insults and violence. Peregrine repented and asked Philip for forgiveness. St. Philip received him with kindness. The moment had a profound effect on Peregrine. Filled with remorse, he began to pray more and to channel his energies into good works. A few years later, he joined the Servites in Siena and went on to be ordained a priest.Foley OFM, Leonard. Saint of the Day: Lives, Lessons, and Feast (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media Statue in the Peregrine Chapel of the Serra Chapel in Mission San Juan Capistrano After some years he was sent back to Forl√¨, where he founded a new Servite house there and became well known for his preaching and holiness as well as his devotion to the sick and poor. It is said that he miraculously multiplied grain and wine during a severe shortage in his area. People took to calling him the \\"Angel of Good Counsel\\", so grateful were they for his wise advice so freely given.\\"The Story of St. Peregrine\\", Franciscan Mission Associates One of the special penances he imposed on himself was to stand whenever it was not necessary to sit. When tired he would support himself on a choir stall. At the age of 60, he developed an infection in his right leg. His condition deteriorated to the point that the physician decided to amputate his leg. The night before the operation Peregrine spent time praying before a fresco of the Crucifixion in the chapter room. He fell into a deep trance-like sleep and seemed to see Jesus descend from the cross to touch his leg. The following day, the doctor arrived to perform the amputation and finding no sign of the cancer, news spread of the miraculous cure throughout the town. This only increased the people‚Äôs regard for Peregrine. The saint died of a fever on May 1, 1345, at the age of 85. An extraordinary number of people from the town and countryside honored his death. Some of the sick who came were healed through his intercession. Veneration His body rests in the Servite church of Forl√¨, the Basilica of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi.Basilica of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi Pope Paul V declared him blessed in 1609 and Pope Benedict XIII canonized him in 1726. The liturgical feast of Saint Pellegrino/Peregrine is on May 1. Peregrine is considered the patron saint of those suffering from cancer. The National Shrine of Saint Peregrine is located at Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica in Chicago, Illinois, as a ministry of the Friar Servants of Mary.National Shrine of St. Peregrine, Friar Servants of Mary There is a St. Peregrine Shrine at The Grotto, at The National Sanctuary of Our Sorrowful Mother, in Portland, Oregon. A St. Peregrine Mass is celebrated at The Grotto on the first Saturday of each month at 12 noon in the Chapel of Mary. The Grotto, The National Sanctuary of Our Sorrowful Mother and there is also a St. Peregrine Laziosi Parish and Diocesan Shrine in Muntinlupa City in the Philippines. It houses a relic taken from St. Peregrine himself, a rib. It is currently on display in the church's Relic Chapel. There is a Saint Peregrine Cancer Shrine with Perpetual Eucharistic Adoration at Christ the King Catholic Church in Mesa, Arizona. The mission of this St. Peregrine Shrine is to promote perpetual adoration of Jesus Christ and to pray for those affected by cancer. In the midst of suffering, a sanctuary for spiritual healing and emotional peace is offered. There also is a statue of St. Peregrine in the mission church of San Juan Capistrano in southern California. Legacy According to some, the lesson of Peregrine's life is not that God worked a miracle, but that a faithful servant placed himself, unconditionally, in the hands of God. Peregrine's trust in God therefore serves as a model for those dealing with sickness. At least one medical journal has cited St. Peregrine's as a potential case of bacterial or viral infection eradicating cancerous cells.Cann SH, Van Netten JP, Van Netten C.

The basic layout of the city is an eight point star, created by overlaying two squares so that all the corners were equidistant. This shape is then inscribed within a perfect circular moat. This shape is iconographic and probably ties to Filarete‚Äôs interest in magic and astrology. Consistent with Quattrocento or fifteenth century notions concerning the talismanic power of geometry and the crucial importance of astrology, Filarete provides, in addition to pragmatic advice on materials, construction, and fortifications, notes on how to propitiate celestial harmony within Sforzinda. In terms of planning, each of the outer points of the star had towers, while the inner angles had gates. Each of the gates was an outlet of radial avenues that each passed through a market square, dedicated to certain goods. All the avenues finally converged in a large square which was centrally located. The town contained three squares: one for the prince‚Äôs palace, one for the cathedral, and one for the market. Because the Italian Renaissance was much taken with the idea of the canal town, in Filarete's Sforzinda every other street had a canal for cargo transport. The canal system also connected with the river, and thus the outside world, for the import and export of goods. The city also contained many buildings, including parishes and separate schools for boys and girls. An example of a building that appears in the treatise is Filarete‚Äôs House of Vice and Virtue, a ten-story structure with a brothel on the bottom and an academy of learning on the higher levels. Filarete did much study on representation of Vices and Virtues, and there are suggestions that his radial design for the city was inspired by St. Augustine‚Äôs \\"Earthly City\\", whose circular shape was divided into sections, each of which had its own Vice and Virtue. The design of Sforzinda may have been in part a direct response to the congested cities of the Medieval period, whose organic growth did not ordinarily depend on conscious city planning,Exceptions are the new cities, called bastides, founded from the 12th to 14th centuries in southeastern France, in order to replace destroyed cities and organize defence and growth. Among those, Monpazier, Beaumont-du-P√©rigord and Viller√©al may be cited. which meant they could be difficult to navigate or control. In part, the Renaissance humanist interest in classical texts may have stimulated preoccupations with geometry in city layouts, as for example, in Plato's description of Atlantis. Filarete‚Äôs ideal plan was meant to reflect on society ‚Äì where a perfect city form would be the image of a perfect society, an idea that was typical of the humanist views prevalent during the Renaissance. The Renaissance ideal city, implied the centralized power of a prince in its organization, an idea following closely on the heels of Dante‚Äôs that \\"The human race is at its best under a monarch.\\" Thus, it could be argued that the Renaissance ideal city form was tensioned between the perceived need for a centralized power and the potential reality of tyranny.

Winterreise, from Series XX, Volume 9 of Franz Schubert's Werke, edited by Eusebius Mandyczewski Eusebius Mandyczewski ( ƒñvsevij Mandyƒçev≈õkyj, ; 18 August 1857, in Molodiya ‚Äì 13 August 1929, in Vienna) was a Romanian musicologist, composer, conductor, and teacher. He was an author of numerous musical works and is highly regarded within Austrian, Romanian and Ukrainian music circles. Personal life Eusebius Mandyczewski was born in the village of Bahrynivka (Ukrainian: –ë–∞–≥—Ä–∏–Ω—ñ–≤–∫–∞; Romanian: Bahrine»ôti)Vladimir Acatrini Restoration of the facts about the origin of Eusebius Mandyczewski, Young Scientist, No 11 (51), November, 2017, pp 703-706. http://molodyvcheny.in.ua/files/journal/2017/11/171.pdf (then Austria-Hungary; now Ukraine, Hlyboka Raion) on 18 August 1857. His father was a priest and his mother, Veronica, born Popovici, was the sister of Eusebiu Popovici, erudite professor of History at the University of Cernauti and the father of the Bucovinian poet Gheorghe Popovici (known under the pen name of T. Robeanu). His origin according to the father has Slavic affiliations; according to his mother the origin is Romanian. Eusebius had two brothers (Georgiy and Prof. Kostiantyn) and one sister (Kateryna). Kostiantyn was a secondary school teacher, member of the regional School Council and later Head of the Chernivtsi Library. Kateryna Mandychevs'ka was a school teacher. Georgiy was also a composer of choral music. He finished his secondary studies at the upper school of Chernivtsi and simultaneously studied music under Sydir Vorobkevych. He began studies at the University of Chernivtsi, then moved to the Vienna Conservatory in 1875 and studied music history under Eduard Hanslick, music theory under Martin Gustav Nottebohm and Robert Fuchs. Beginning in 1879, he became a close and lifelong friend of Johannes Brahms and a prominent member of the 'Brahms circle' (who aided Brahms in teaching Gustav Jenner). Johannes Brahms supported the young composer and appointed him as curator of his estate. In 1901, he married Albine von Vest, a Lieder singer and singing teacher.Peter Clive, Schubert and His World: A Biographical Dictionary, published 1997, 344pp, , p. 165  Career  From 1879 to 1881, Mandyczewski was the conductor of the Vienna Singakademie. From 1887 to 1929, he was the archivist and librarian of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. In 1892 he became director of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde orchestra. The decade from 1887 to 1897 saw the appearance of Mandyczewski's work on the Schubert Gesamtausgabe. His name is particularly associated with the ten volumes of songs, which he edited meticulously, sometimes printing as many as three or four variants of individual songs; in recognition of his editorship he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Leipzig in 1897. A gifted philologist as well as musician, he was widely respected both for his scholarship and for his generosity to inquiring scholars; Grove was indebted to him for his help in the writing of his book on Beethoven's symphonies. Mandyczewski also brought out a second volume of Nottebohm‚Äôs Beethoveniana, a series of pioneering essays in Beethoven scholarship that had been partly published in series in the Musikalisches Wochenblatt and partly left in manuscript.Brown Maurice JE, 'Mandyczewski Eusebius' in The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians In 1897 he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Leipzig.Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, 'AEIOU Project', aeiou.iicm.tugraz.at/aeiou.encyclop.m/m089171.htm Later in 1897, he began teaching at the Vienna Conservatory as Professor of Music History and Musical Instruments. In 1916 he was made a Privy Councillor. Mandyczewski edited the complete edition of Franz Schubert's works, began a complete edition of Joseph Haydn's and, together with his pupil Hans G√°l, edited Brahms's complete works. For many years in the early part of the 20th century he was the Viennese correspondent to the Musical Times. He was joint editor of the Brahms Gesamtausgabe with Hans G√°l, and organized the Schubert exhibition of 1922 and the International Schubert Congress (1928); this last function greatly overtaxed his strength, and he died before the proceedings of the congress were published. Mandyczewski composed music to the words of poets such as Taras Shevchenko, Yurii Fedkovych, Vasile Alecsandri, Mihai Eminescu, and Heinrich Heine. He arranged compositions based on many Ukrainian, Romanian, German, and Hungarian folk songs. Mandyczewski died in Sulz near Vienna, Austria on 13 August 1929.

The segment debuted as part of \\"America Rock,\\" the third season of the Schoolhouse Rock! series. Overview The song is sung by Jack Sheldon (the voice of the Bill), with dialogue by Sheldon's son John as the boy learning the process. It is about how a bill becomes a law, how it must go through Congress, and how it can be vetoed, etc. The Bill is for the law that school buses must stop at railroad crossings, likely a refrence to the Gilchrest Road, New York crossing accident. In the song, the Bill becomes a law, in reality, such a bill has never been approved by the United States Congress, but an equivalent regulation was codified by the United States Department of Transportation at . The song was covered by The Folk Implosion as \\"Deluxx Folk Implosion\\" for Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks in 1996. In popular culture The rap group Groove B. Chill sings the tune with new lyrics \\"We're Groove B. Chill/and we're sitting here on top of the hill\\" in their song \\"Top of The Hill\\" from their 1990 album Starting From Zero. A few lines from Deluxx Folk Implosion's cover of the song can be heard in the 2003 movie Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and is included on the film's official soundtrack. In one of the commercials made by the now-defunct retail store Mervyn's as part of its renowned \\"Open, Open, Open\\" campaign, a woman and the Bill are waiting outside at one of the store's locations. An employee walks to the front to open the automatic door, but opens a smaller version of it for the Bill to enter, much to the woman's chagrin. At the close of this commercial, the woman wakes up as if it is a dream, while her child watches the \\"I'm Just a Bill\\" video on the TV screen. The sketch was parodied in The Simpsons episode \\"The Day the Violence Died\\", in which Krusty the Clown presents \\"I'm an Amendment to Be\\", depicting a Constitutional amendment's attempt to ban flag burning. The sketch was later briefly parodied in another Fox produced animated series, Family Guy. In the episode, \\"Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington\\", an anthropomorphic legal bill sings on the steps of the U.S. Capitol Building until he is stabbed and stuffed into a garbage bag by a sanitation engineer. Jack Sheldon provided the voice of the amendment in both parodies. The song was featured prominently in the Disney made-for-TV movie Mail to the Chief starring Randy Quaid. In the February 12, 2006 episode of Inside the Actors Studio, when James Lipton asked Dave Chappelle what he wanted to hear when he arrived in heaven, Chappelle answered, \\"Congratulations, Bill, you're a law.\\" A Season 1 episode of the Knight Rider TV series, in which a senator requires protection after attempts on her life, is entitled Just My Bill. At the end of another Schoolhouse Rock! song, Tyrannosaurus Debt (Money Rock), the Bill runs off after the tour guide says, \\"Feeding time is ALL the time!\\" This made Bill one of the only characters to appear on more than one of the main Schoolhouse Rock! cartoons. Mr. Morton & Interplanet Janet appeared in 2 direct-to-video episodes. The Board of Education character from the Drawn Together episode \\"Foxy vs. the Board of Education\\" is a parody of the Bill. The rock band Primus borrow the lyrics in their song \\"To Defy the Laws of Tradition\\". In the January 16, 2011 issue of the comic strip Prickly City, Winslow, who is a long-time fan, discovers that the bill (in this case an oversized piece of legislation) likes to smoke and drink, and proceeds to tell Winslow that if he wants to get an autograph that he'll need to pay 100 bucks and has to be bribed with laundering money through political action committees. When Winslow reminds him of what the bill represents in the song, the bill's response was \\"I'm Just a Bill! A thirsty bill. Who's a guy gotta bribe to get a drink freshened up around here?\\" The song was parodied in the Mad segment \\"GleeVR\\" where Garfield sings \\"I'm Just a Cat\\" which sounds similar to the song. The video was referenced in Johnny Bravo: when Johnny walks past the Congress Building, he sees a bill sitting on the steps, just like the video. However, when they announce that the bill will not make it to the White House, a man comes out and destroys the bill with a flamethrower. Dee Bradley Baker provided the voice of the bill. The Bill appears in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Robot Fight Accident\\", with a few other Schoolhouse Rock! characters (voiced by Seth Green). The sketch was parodied in the opening sketch of Saturday Night Live on November 22, 2014. The bill, played by Kenan Thompson, is an immigration bill singing a slightly altered version of the song to the boy (Kyle Mooney). However, President Obama (Jay Pharoah) pushes the bill down the Capitol Hill steps several times while explaining to the boy that it is far easier to utilize an executive order (Bobby Moynihan), as a critique on Obama's frequent usage of executive orders during his term. Bill Burr made a reference to the song on Conan on January 30, 2017 ( minutes into the interview). Stephen Colbert parodied the opening of the song in a segment on The Late Show on March 27, 2017 in response to the withdrawal of the American Healthcare Act in the US House of Representatives the prior week. The May 16, 2017 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! featured an animated parody of the segment, titled \\"I'm Just a Lie\\", satirizing the Trump Administration's use of \\"alternative facts\\". The fourth season premiere of Black-ish, (\\"Juneteenth\\"), which aired on October 3, 2017, included an animated parody titled \\"I'm Just a Slave\\", with the music performed by Aloe Blacc. In January 2018, the character Bill was used in an editorial cartoon by syndicated cartoonist Greg Kearney dealing with the issue of the Kansas state legislature's use of anonymous introduction of legislation. In October 2019, Homsar, a character in Homestar Runner, dressed up as the bill in the series' annual Halloween special. 2007 reference to the cartoon in the United States Senate Criticizing a comprehensive immigration reform bill, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) critiqued the proposed legislation for three hours on May 21, 2007 in front of \\"a giant picture of a famous scene from Schoolhouse Rock's 'I'm just a bill' skit.\\" The caption on the picture was \\"How a Senate Bill Becomes a Law\\". Sessions pointed out how the reform bill had proceeded through the Senate in contrast with what educational material like the cartoon had laid out, saying \\"[Professor Hugh Hewitt has written that this is] Not what we were taught in grade school, I assure you, and I couldn‚Äôt agree more. This is not how the process is supposed to work. We should not be asked to trust our colleagues and vote to put a bill on the floor when we do not know that the bill text is even finalized, that the bill has not been drafted by legislative counsel, the bill has not been introduced or even given a bill number, the committee process was skipped and not followed, a Congressional Budget Office score may not have been requested.\\" References External links * 1976 American television episodes Schoolhouse Rock!

On October 10, 1944 the squadron absorbed personnel and equipment from VMF-481 and they were redesignated a fighter pilot replacement training unit. The unit flew the Vought F4U-1 Corsair during this time. Shortly thereafter they transferred to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California and remained there until the end of the war. The squadron was quickly deactivated after the war's end on September 10, 1945.Sherrod History of Marine Corps Aviation in WWII, p.471. =1950s and early 1960s= CH-37C with an UH-34D from HMM-363 near MCAS Tustin, 1964.

In March 1958 the squadron received the Sikorsky HR2S-1(CH-37 Mojave), known as the \\"Deuce.\\" In July 1958 the squadron participated in NASA‚Äôs abort recovery tests of the Mercury space capsule in the Salton Sea. During July 1959 HMR(M)-462 worked with the United States Army in El Paso, Texas to conduct the initial aerial transport tests of the Hawk missile system. One year later, the squadron worked with Convair Astronautics Corporation in San Diego to help construct Atlas missile silos. Also during 1960, HMR(M)-462 joined with the Federal Aviation Administration, Sikorsky Aircraft, the U.S. Army, New York Airways and British technical representatives of the Decca Corporation to establish Instrument Flight Procedures for helicopters.

Nelson turned over command of the squadron to the new Commanding Officer, LtCol R.K. Wood. On 20 October 1969 as part of Operation Keystone Cardinal, HMH-462 departed from Phu Bai to the for transport to Okinawa to provide support to Marine forces in Japan. In 1975 HMH-462, still stationed in Okinawa, was assigned to the 9th MAB and 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. On 12 April 1975 the squadron operating from , participated in Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of Phnom Penh. Seventeen days later from 29‚Äì30 April, HMH-462 participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon. Shortly thereafter, the squadron was embarked upon the and sailed back towards Cambodia to participate in the rescue operation of the SS Mayaguez. The Mayaguez rescue was completed before the Hancock arrived on station and the Hancock returned to Subic Bay. =Post Vietnam and the 1990s= After nearly ten years of continuous overseas service, HMH-462 was relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Tustin, California and assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 16. They also participated in the Unit Deployment Program to MCAS Futenma, Okinawa, In December 1989, a squadron detachment was assigned to participate in coup contingency operations in the Republic of the Philippines as part of Marine Aircraft Group 90. In August 1990, the \\"Heavy Haulers\\" were assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 70 and deployed to Jubail, Saudi Arabia as part transport, MEDEVAC, VIP, and FARP support to MAG-70/16 and I Marine Expeditionary Force operations. In February 1991, the squadron relocated to Tanajib, Saudi Arabia, where it provided support for Operation Desert Storm. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the squadron returned to MCAS Tustin. During March 1991, the squadron received the 1990 Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award. In September, the squadron reached another milestone when it completed 15,000 class A mishap free flight hours. In 1992 it was also announced that HMH-462 had been selected for transition to the CH-53E Super Stallion. In June, the Heavy Haulers took possession of their first CH-53E Super Stallion and began the transition process. A HMH-462 CH-53E in 2002. In 1996, the squadron reached another milestone when it completed 28,000 class A mishap free flight hours. In May of the same year, after completing another unit deployment to Okinawa, Japan. The \\"Heavy Haulers\\" received the Heavy Helicopter Squadron of the Year Award from the Marine Corps Aviation Association for 1996. In March 1997, HMH-462 surpassed 30,000 class A mishap free flight hours. After returning home in May 1998 from another unit deployment cycle. They became the first helicopter squadron in MAG-16 to make the transition from Tustin to MCAS Miramar, California. In December of the same year, HMH-462 surpassed yet another class A mishap free flight hour milestone of 35,000 hours and received the Heavy Helicopter Squadron of the Year award for 1998. =The Global War on Terror= HMH 462 served in Operation Iraqi Freedom from February 2003 to October 2003 and Operation Enduring Freedom from September 2004 to May 2005. They flew many missions supporting logistics and combat missions involving insertion and extraction of special forces groups. ‚ÄòHeavy Haulers‚Äô prepare for deployment =Proposed Deactivation= Commandant Gen. David Berger released a news statement on the future of the USMC. In it he states that, \\"Developing a force that incorporates emerging technologies and a significant change to force structure within our current resource constraints will require the Marine Corps to become smaller and remove legacy capabilities.\\" As part of this significant change to force structure, in May 2020 the USMC reorganization plan proposed the squadron to be deactivated in 2022. However the proposed reorganization plan was changed to deactivate HMH-463 at MCAS Kaneohe Bay after a detailed cost analysis provided by HQMC Aviation.

McDonald (1886‚Äì1958) founded Zenith Radio in 1921, a major American radio and electronics manufacturer for most of the twentieth century. Early life Eugene F. McDonald Jr. was born March 11, 1886 in Syracuse, New York, the son of Frazier McDonald and Betty May Thompson McDonald. He earned his first money while a schoolboy by reading electric meters. School did not appeal to McDonald, and at the end of his sophomore year in high school he left school to take a factory job with the Franklin Automobile Company. Moving to Chicago in 1904, he became an automobile salesman with the Franklin Auto Company and, as a publicity stunt, once drove a car up the steps of the General John Logan Memorial in Grant Park‚Äîwith a photographer present and a policeman there to arrest him. He paid the policeman $10 for the arrest. In 1904, he began working for the company in Syracuse. He quickly rose in the sales and promotion areas and made a name for himself. In 1910, he moved back to Chicago to join a speculative business of a friend of his who wished to manufacture an automobile self-starter. The business did not succeed and McDonald lost his investment. In 1911, he was in partnership in Detroit selling used cars, and by the end of 1912 had begun a credit finance company for the purchase of new and used cars, a commodity that had previously not been available on credit. He was the first to offer working people a payment plan for the purchase of an automobile. Military service When the United States entered World War I in 1917, he enlisted in the Naval intelligence service and eventually became a lieutenant commander. His commission came about as he understood the operation a device used in the Navy for recording radio and telephone conversations ‚Äì the 'telegraphone' ‚Äì and the manufacturer was no longer in business. He remained in the service until 1919 but continued service in the U.S.N.R.F. (US Naval Reserve Forces) until 1939. He kept the title of lieutenant commander for the rest of his life, having retired at the rank from the USNR. Founding of Zenith Radio Corporation He joined with Ralph Matthews and Karl Hassel, the three of them incorporating the Zenith Corporation (formerly Chicago Radio Labs) in 1923.Bryant, John H. and Cones, Harold N. The Zenith Trans-Oceanic:The Royalty of Radios. Atglen: Schiffer Publishing, 1995. From the call letters of their amateur station, 9ZN, they developed the trade name of ZN-th. The company survived the Great Depression and was soon the leader of radio manufacturers. At the same time McDonald launched a career as an explorer and adventurer that publicized the Zenith products and sent sales to new records. He formed and was the first president of the National Association of Broadcasters and pioneered the development of the short-wave radio. When Donald B. MacMillan made his Arctic trip he was equipped with transmitters and receivers supplied by the Zenith Corporation. ‚ÄúHe expanded the radio medium into international communications, ship-to- shore, radar, and VHF and UHF television.‚Äù The company slogan was: ‚ÄúThe quality goes in before the name goes on.\\" The Zenith Corporation was a great company and a good example to others. During the Great Depression, Zenith employees took less pay and worked longer hours to keep the company alive. As the economy improved, Comdr. McDonald rewarded them with additional shares in the company and a larger portion of its profits. He became interested in the radio business in 1920 upon learning that there was money to be made in it. However, it was necessary to hold a manufacturing license from Edwin Armstrong - and issuance of these had been suspended indefinitely. However, in 1921 he entered into a partnership with the founders of the Chicago Radio Laboratory, Karl Hassel, and Ralph Matthews. Under the tradename \\"Z-nith\\", this company held a valuable Armstrong license but lacked funds for expansion to meet the demands of their order book. McDonald was appointed general manager and the partnership was formally incorporated in 1923 as the Zenith Radio Corporation. By 1927, the company was large enough to secure its own RCA manufacturing license. McDonald was well known for his charismatic leadership style, and his unexpected death in 1958 reportedly \\"left a void of talent at the top\\" of the company.Collins, James C., and Porras, Jerry I.

The Zenith Trans-Oceanic ‚Äì the first portable multiband radio and Eugene McDonald's dream come true  Brief summary The Zenith 7G605 Trans-Oceanic Clipper 1941-1942 LEFT: The Royal 2000 Tran-Symphony (1960), First American FM/AM Portable RIGHT: The Royal 1000 Trans-Oceanic (1957)- First Transistor Portable Multiband Radio Eugene McDonald, besides being a hard-driving and demanding CEO, was also a yachtsman. His yacht the Mizpah (AKA USS Mizpah (PY-29)) was one of the largest in the Great Lakes region. Toward the end of 1939 the interest in the war in Europe increased. McDonald had poor reception of any regional broadcast aboard the Mizpah and suggested that a portable radio be produced that could receive not only standard broadcast (AM radio) but higher-frequency shortwave broadcast to receive international broadcasts that use radio frequencies that could bounce off the Earth's ionosphere (upper atmosphere) and travel great distances. One of the big obstacles to design such a radio was that vacuum tubes in the 1930s and 1940s had trouble operating at higher frequencies using battery power supplies which were lower voltage than AC-operated designs. In late 1941 after many rejects by McDonald (who personally did the testing on his yacht). Zenith Radio engineers Gustaffson, Passow, Striker and Emde came up with the model 7G605 \\"Clipper\\", that was met with approval by McDonald after stringent testing. Zenith advertised this new product extensively, including loaning or giving one to a celebrity or well-known individual to try and evaluate. Zenith made electronics and radio history by producing the first totally portable multiband radio designed for standard and shortwave broadcast listening. Zenith went into production in 1942, but the US entry into World War II put a production halt to the \\"Clipper\\". Although no new consumer Trans-Oceanics were made, Zenith provided them for the war effort and continued to advertise and promote the Trans-Oceanic during World War II. Very few were produced (35,000), and not very many are in service presently, which makes this a very rare item. In December 1957, Eugene McDonald and Zenith engineers put Zenith Radio back into the news with the world's first portable transistorized multiband radio, the Royal 1000 Trans-Oceanic. McDonald was personally involved with its conception and manufacture, as he was in the development of the 7G605 \\"Clipper\\" The Royal 1000 like the \\"Clipper\\" was designed for standard and shortwave broadcast reception. The quality construction and engineering design efforts, a Zenith trademark were mechanically and electronically demonstrated in this model. This was McDonald's last major involvement with Zenith as he died the following year. The Trans-Oceanic is considered by many the best-designed mass-produced portable radio made. Zenith for the most part, until the end of the model line, used the latest cost- effective technology advances and materials in Trans-Oceanics. The Trans- Oceanic model line ran from 1942 to 1982. For years it was the top selling \\"high-end\\" portable multiband radio until it was finally eclipsed by Sony with their digital tuning ICF-2001 and ICF2010 in the 1980s, which put the Trans- Oceanic out of business. Zenith introduces the television remote control  Zenith Radio Advertisement for \\"Lazy Bones\\" remote control, 1951 RCA's promoting radio manufacturers to build televisions with its no royalty policy got Zenith Radio into the TV business during the end of the 1940s. McDonald, whose aversion to commercials was well-known, wanted Zenith to produce and sell a remote control. In 1950 Zenith came up with a remote control called the \\"Lazy Bones\\" which was connected with wires to the TV set. The next development was the \\"Flashmatic\\" (1955), designed by Eugene Polley, a wireless remote control that used a light beam to signal the TV (with a photosensitive pickup device) to change stations. One problem was that during the daytime the sensitivity degraded. In 1956 Zenith began producing a remote control named after McDonald's nickname \\"The Commander\\" and calling it the \\"Space Command\\". This new technology worked by sending an ultrasonic tone to the TV set, where it was picked up with a miniature microphone sensitive to only that tone. At the cost of $259.95, it was truly a luxury item. Public notices of family life  McDonald married the former Inez Riddle but they divorced in 1947. In 1962, four years after the commander's death, his former wife Inez Riddle McDonald Neale sought to have the divorce set aside. There was a long and ugly trial played out in the local newspapers. The children sided with the mother but she was finally denied her request. The McDonald estate was estimated to be worth $30 million, but there were also lower estimates. Details of the decision were (McDonald v Neale) filed in 1962. It was ruled against claims his former wife petitioned for. The Illinois court ruling can be seen at this link McDonald Jr vs Neale.

There were over 30 Indo-Greek kings, often in competition on different territories. Many of them are only known through their coins. Many of the dates, territories, and relationships between Indo-Greek kings are tentative and essentially based on numismatic analysis (find places, overstrikes, monograms, metallurgy, styles), a few Classical writings, and Indian writings and epigraphic evidence. The following list of kings, dates and territories after the reign of Demetrius is derived from the latest and most extensive analysis on the subject, by Osmund Bopearachchi and R. C. Senior. The invasion of northern India, and the establishment of what would be known as the \\"Indo- Greek kingdom\\", started around 200 BCE when Demetrius, son of the Greco- Bactrian king Euthydemus I, led his troops across the Hindu Kush. Apollodotus, may have made advances in the south, while Menander, led later invasions further east. Following his conquests, Demetrius received the title Œ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÑŒøœÇ (\\"Anicetus\\", lit. invincible), a title never given to any king before.The title \\"Anicetus\\" for Demetrius is visible on the pedigree coins minted by Agathocles. Indo-Greek Kingdoms in 100 BCE. Demetrius I \\"the Invincible\\" (205‚Äì171 BCE), wearing the scalp of an elephant, symbol of his conquests in India. Written evidence of the initial Greek invasion survives in the Greek writings of Strabo and Justin, and in Sanskrit in the records of Patanjali, KƒÅlidƒÅsa, and in the Yuga Purana, among others. Coins and architectural evidence also attest to the extent of the initial Greek campaign. Evidence of the initial invasion =Greco-Roman sources= The Greco-Bactrians went over the Hindu Kush and also started to re-occupy the area of Arachosia, where Greek populations had been living since before the acquisition of the territory by Chandragupta from Seleucus. Isidore of Charax describes Greek cities there, one of them called Demetrias, probably in honour of the conqueror Demetrius.In the 1st century BCE, the geographer Isidorus of Charax mentions Parthians ruling over Greek populations and cities in Arachosia: \\"Beyond is Arachosia. And the Parthians call this White India; there are the city of Biyt and the city of Pharsana and the city of Chorochoad and the city of Demetrias; then Alexandropolis, the metropolis of Arachosia; it is Greek, and by it flows the river Arachotus. As far as this place the land is under the rule of the Parthians.\\" \\"Parthians stations\\", 1st century BCE. Mentioned in Bopearachchi, \\"Monnaies Greco-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques\\", p52.

According to Strabo, Greek advances temporarily went as far as the Shunga capital Pataliputra (today Patna) in eastern India: The Hellenistic world view just before the Indo-Greek conquests. India appears fully formed, with the Ganges and Palibothra (Pataliputra) in the east. (19th-century reconstruction of the ancient world map of Eratosthenes (276‚Äì194 BCE).Source) The 1st century BCE Greek historian Apollodorus, quoted by Strabo, affirms that the Bactrian Greeks, led by Demetrius I and Menander, conquered India and occupied a larger territory than the Greeks under Alexander the Great, going beyond the Hypanis towards the Himalayas:Strabo quoting Apollodorus on the extent of Greek conquests: :* \\"Apollodorus, for instance, author of the Parthian History, when he mentions the Greeks who occasioned the revolt of Bactriana from the Syrian kings, who were the successors of Seleucus Nicator, says, that when they became powerful they invaded India. He adds no discoveries to what was previously known, and even asserts, in contradiction to others, that the Bactrians had subjected to their dominion a larger portion of India than the Macedonians; for Eucratides (one of these kings) had a thousand cities subject to his authority.\\" Strabo 15-1-3 Full text :* \\"The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of Ariana, but also of India, as Apollodorus of Artemita says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander‚Äîby Menander in particular (at least if he actually crossed the Hypanis towards the east and advanced as far as the Ima√ºs), for some were subdued by him personally and others by Demetrius, the son of Euthydemus the king of the Bactrians.\\" (Strabo 11.11.1 Full text) The Roman historian Justin also mentioned the Indo-Greek kingdom, describing a \\"Demetrius, King of the Indians\\" (\\"Regis Indorum\\"), and explaining that after vanquishing him Eucratides in turn \\"put India under his rule\\" (\\"Indiam in potestatem redegit\\")Justin on Demetrius \\"King of the Indians\\": \\"Multa tamen Eucratides bella magna uirtute gessit, quibus adtritus cum obsidionem Demetrii, regis Indorum, pateretur, cum CCC militibus LX milia hostium adsiduis eruptionibus uicit. Quinto itaque mense liberatus Indiam in potestatem redegit.\\" (\\"Eucratides led many wars with great courage, and, while weakened by them, was put under siege by Demetrius, king of the Indians. He made numerous sorties, and managed to vanquish 60,000 enemies with 300 soldiers, and thus liberated after four months, he put India under his rule\\") Justin XLI,6 (since the time of the embassies of Megasthenes in the 3rd century BCE \\"India\\" was understood as the entire subcontinent, and was cartographed by geographers such as Eratosthenes). Justin also mentions Apollodotus and Menander as kings of the Indians.\\"Indicae quoque res additae, gestae per Apollodotum et Menandrum, reges eorum\\": \\"Also included are the exploits in India by Apollodotus and Menander, their kings\\" Justin, quoted in E.Seldeslachts, p284 Greek and Indian sources tend to indicate that the Greeks campaigned as far as Pataliputra until they were forced to retreat. This advance probably took place under the reign of Menander, the most important Indo-Greek king (A.K. Narain and Keay 2000) and was likely only of a military advance of temporary nature, perhaps in alliance with native Indian states. The permanent Indo-Greek dominions extended only from the Kabul Valley to the eastern Punjab or slightly further east. An Indo-Greek stone palette showing Poseidon with attendants.

(Ptolemy, Geographia, VII 1, 55). * Prasiane - North of Abiria and East of the main Indus channel. (Pliny, Natural history, VI 71) * Surastrene - Southeast of Patalene, comprising the Kathiawar peninsula and parts of Gujarat to Bharuch (modern Saurashtra and Surat), with the city of \\"Theophila\\". (Ptolemy, Geographia, VII 1, 55/ Strabo 11.11.1/ Periplus, Chap.41‚Äì47). * Sigerdis - a coastal region beyond Patalene and Surastrene, thought to correspond to Sindh. (Strabo 11.11.1) * Souastene - subdivision of Gandhara, comprising the Swat Valley (Ptolemy, Geographia, VII 1, 42). * Goryaea - smaller district located between the lower Swat river and the Kunar (Bajaur), with the city of \\"Nagara, also called Dionysopolis\\". (Ptolemy, Geographia, VII 1, 42). * Peucelaitas - denotes the immediate district around Pushkalavati (Greek: Peucela). (Arrian, On India, IV 11) * Kaspeiria - comprising the upper valleys of the Chenab, Ravi, and Jhelum (i.e., southern Kashmir). (Ptolemy, Geographia, VII 1, 42). * Pandouorum - Region of the Punjab along the Hydaspes river, with the \\"city of Sagala, also called Euthydemia\\" and another city named \\"Bucephala\\" (Ptolemy, Geographia, VII 1), or \\"Bucephalus Alexandria\\" (Periplus, 47). * Kulindrene - as related by Ptolemy, a region comprising the upper valleys of the Sutlej, Jumna, Beas, and Ganges.

The term Yavana is thought to be a transliteration of \\"Ionians\\" and is known to have designated Hellenistic Greeks (starting with the Edicts of Ashoka, where Ashoka writes about \\"the Yavana king Antiochus\\"), but may have sometimes referred to other foreigners as well, especially in later centuries.

The Anushasanaparava of the Mahabharata affirms that the country of Mathura, the heartland of India, was under the joint control of the Yavanas and the Kambojas.\\"tatha Yavana Kamboja Mathuram.abhitash cha ye./ ete ashava.yuddha.kushaladasinatyasi charminah.\\"//5‚Äî(MBH 12/105/5, Kumbhakonam Ed) The Vayupurana asserts that Mathura was ruled by seven Greek kings over a period of 82 years.\\"Asui dve ca varsani bhoktaro Yavana mahim/ Mathuram ca purim ramyam Yauna bhoksyanti sapta vai\\" Vayupurana 99.362 and 383, quoted by Morton Smith 1973: 370. Morton Smith thinks occupation lasted from 175 to 93 BCE. Accounts of battles between the Greeks and the Shunga in Central India are also found in the MƒÅlavikƒÅgnimitram, a play by KƒÅlidƒÅsa which describes an encounter between Greek forces and Vasumitra, the grandson of Pushyamitra, during the latter's reign.\\"Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian coins in the Smithsonian institution\\", Bopearachchi, p16.

The \\"Sindhu\\" referred to in this context may refer the river Indus: but such an extension of Shunga power seems unlikely, and it is more probable that it denotes one of two rivers in central India -either the Sindhu river which is a tributary of the Yamuna, or the Kali- Sindhu river which is a tributary of the Chambal.\\" The Yuga Purana, Mitchener, 2002.

A pillar discovered in Reh, in the Ganges valley 350 km south-east of Mathura mentions Menander: Another inscription 17mk from Mathura, the Maghera inscription, contains the phrase \\"In the 116th year of the Greek kings...\\", suggesting Greek rule in the area until around 70 BCE, as the \\"Greek era\\" is thought to have started around 186 BCE.R. C. Senior, 2006, p.xv =Archaeological remains= Urban remains The city of Sirkap, today in northwestern Pakistan near Taxila, was built according to the \\"Hippodamian\\" grid-plan characteristic of Greek cities, and was a Hellenistic fortress of considerable proportions, with a 6,000 meter wall on the circumference, of a height of about 10 meters. The houses of the Indo-Greek level are \\"the best planned of all the six strata, and the rubble masonry of which its walls are built is also the most solid and compact\\".Marshall, \\"Sirkap Archeological Report\\", p 15‚Äì16 It is thought that the city was built by Demetrius. Artifacts ancient Taxila. Source: John Marshall \\"Taxila, Archaeological excavations\\". Several Hellenistic artifacts have been found, in particular coins of Indo-Greek kings, stone palettes representing Greek mythological scenes, and small statuettes. Some of them are purely Hellenistic, others indicate an evolution of the Greco-Bactrian styles found at Ai-Khanoum towards more indianized styles. For example, accessories such as Indian ankle bracelets can be found on some representations of Greek mythological figures such as Artemis. The excavations of the Greek levels at Sirkap were however very limited and made in peripheral areas, out of respect for the more recent archeological strata (those of the Indo-Scythian and especially Indo-Parthian levels) and the remaining religious buildings, and due to the difficulty of excavating extensively to a depth of about 6 meters. The results, although interesting, are partial and cannot be considered as exhaustive.The excavations by John Marshall at Taxila are the only significant excavations ever done, but only a small and peripherical portion of the city of Sirkap has been excavated to the Greek level (\\"The chief area in which digging has been carried down to the Greek strata is a little to the West of the main street near the northern gateway (...) Had it been practicable, I should have preferred to choose an area nearer to the city's center, where more interesting structures may be expected than in the outlying quarters near the city wall\\" (\\"Taxila\\", p120). Overall, the Greek excavations only represented a small part of the excavations: \\"And let me say that seven- eighths of the digging in this area has been devoted to Saka-Parthian structures of the second stratum; one-eight only to the earlier Saka and Greek remains below\\" (\\"Taxila\\", p119) Beyond this, no extensive archaeological excavation of an Indo-Greek city has ever essentially been done.

Diameter: 2.5 meters.Marshall, \\"Taxila\\", p.120 When the Indo-Greeks settled in the area of Taxila, large Buddhist structures were already present, such as the stupa of Dharmarajika built by Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. These structures were reinforced in the following centuries, by building rings of smaller stupas and constructions around the original ones. Numerous coins of the Indo-Greek king Zoilos II were found under the foundation of a 1st-century BCE rectangular chapel near the Dharmarajika stupa.Chapel H, about 50 meters near the Dharmarajika stupa, in Marshall, \\"Excavations at Taxila\\", \\"The only minor antiquities of interest found in this building were twenty-five debased silver coins of the Greek king Zoilus II, which were brought to light beneath the foundations of the earliest chapel\\", p248 Also, various Buddhist structures, such as the Butkara Stupa in the area of Swat were enlarged and decorated with Hellenistic architectural elements in the 2nd century BCE, especially during the rule of Menander.\\"From Butkara I we know that building activities never ceased. The stupa was enlarged in a second phase under Menander, and again when the coins of Azes II were in circulation.\\" Harry Falk \\"Afghanistan, ancien carrefour entre l'Est et l'Ouest\\", p.347. \\"The diffusion, from the second century BCE, of Hellenistic influences in the architecture of Swat is also attested by the archaeological searches at the sanctuary of Butkara I, which saw its stupa \\"monumentalized\\" at that exact time by basal elements and decorative alcoves derived from Hellenistic architecture\\", in \\"De l'Indus a l'Oxus: archaeologie de l'Asie Centrale\\" 2003, Pierfrancesco Callieri, p212 Stupas were just round mounds when the Indo-Greeks settled in India, possibly with some top decorations, but soon they added various structural and decorative elements, such as reinforcement belts, niches, architectural decorations such as plinthes, toruses and cavettos, plaster painted with decorative scrolls. The niches were probably designed to place statues or friezes, an indication of early Buddhist descriptive art during the time of the Indo-Greeks.\\"They were intended to hold a figured panel, relief-work, or something of the kind\\" Domenico Facenna, \\"Butkara I\\" Coins of Menander were found within these constructions dating them to around 150 BCE. By the end of Indo-Greek rule and during the Indo-Scythian period (1st century BCE), stupas were highly decorated with colonnated flights of stairs and Hellenistic scrolls of Acanthus leaves. Consolidation =The end of the first conquests= Back in Bactria a king named Eucratides managed to topple the Euthydemid dynasty around 170 BCE and some years later made himself ruler of the westernmost Indian territories as well, thus weakening the Indo-Greek kingdom and putting a stop to their expansion. Coin of Menander. Greek legend, BASILEOS SOTEROS MENANDROY lit. \\"Saviour King Menander\\". There may also have been setbacks in the east. The Hathigumpha inscription, written by the king of Kalinga, Kharavela, also describes the presence of the Yavana king whose name has been identified as \\"Demetrius\\" with his army in eastern India, apparently as far as the city of Rajagriha about 70 km southeast of Pataliputra and one of the foremost Buddhist sacred cities, but claims that this Demetrius ultimately retreated to Mathura on hearing of Kharavela's military successes further south: The interpretation has been challenged, and a presence this far east seems difficult to attest to Demetrius I, who issued no Indian coins whatsoever. In any case, Eucratides seems to have occupied territory as far as the Indus, between c. 170 BCE and 150 BCE. His advances were ultimately checked by the Indo-Greek king Menander I who asserted himself in the Indian part of the empire, and began the last expansions eastwards. =Consolidation and rise of Menander I= Detail of Asia in the Ptolemy world map. The \\"Menander Mons\\" are in the center of the map, at the east of the Indian subcontinent, beyond the Ganges, right above the Malaysian Peninsula. Menander is considered as probably the most successful Indo-Greek king, and the conqueror of the vastest territory.\\"Numismats and historians are unanimous in considering that Menander was one of the greatest, if not the greatest, and the most famous of the Indo-Greek kings. The coins to the name of Menander are incomparably more abundant than those of any other Indo-Greek king\\" Bopearachchi, \\"Monnaies Gr√©co-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques\\", p76. The finds of his coins are the most numerous and the most widespread of all the Indo-Greek kings. In Antiquity, from at least the 1st century CE, the \\"Menander Mons\\", or \\"Mountains of Menander\\", came to designate the mountain chain at the extreme east of the Indian subcontinent, today's Naga hills and Arakan, as indicated in Ptolemy's world map of the 1st century CE geographer Ptolemy. Menander is also remembered in Buddhist literature, where he called Milinda, and is described in the Milinda Panha as a convert to Buddhism: he became an arhat whose relics were enshrined in a manner reminiscent of the Buddha. He also introduced numismatic reforms, such as issuing coins with portraits, which had hitherto been unknown in India. His most common coin reverse Athena Alkidemos (\\"Protector of the people\\") became a common type for his successors in the East. Conquests east of the Punjab region were most likely made during the second half of the century by the king Menander I, but his eastern conquests were brief. The following passage may allude to the return of Menander to his home territories, perhaps due to a civil war with the competing king Zoilos I, or the nomad invasion of Bactria: Following Menander's reign, about twenty Indo-Greek kings are known to have ruled in succession in the eastern parts of the Indo-Greek territory. Upon his death, Menander was succeeded by his infant son Thraso, but he was apparently murdered and further civil wars ensued. Judging from their coins, many of the later kings claimed descendance from either the Euthydemids or Menander, but the details remain uncertain due to the lack of sources. =The fall of Bactria= From 130 BCE, the Scythians and then the Yuezhi, following a long migration from the border of China, started to invade Bactria from the north. Around 125 BCE, the Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles, was probably killed during the invasion and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom proper ceased to exist. The Indo-Greek kingdom, now entirely isolated from the Hellenistic world, did nevertheless maintain itself, if we can judge from the vast number of coins issued from the following kings, such as Lysias and Antialcidas. During this time, the Indo-Greek territory seems to have extended from the Paropamisadae and Arachosia in the west, to eastern Punjab, perhaps even with further eastern strongholds such as Mathura (see below). It is uncertain when the coastal provinces along the mouth of the Indus and further east were lost, or how tightly they were ever integrated with the kingdom. Later history Throughout the 1st century BCE, the Indo-Greeks progressively lost ground to the Indians in the east, and the Scythians, the Yuezhi, and the Parthians in the West. About 20 Indo-Greek king are known during this period, down to the last known Indo-Greek king Strato II, who ruled in the Punjab region until around 10 CE. =Loss of Mathura and eastern territories (after 100 BCE)= Coin of the Yaudheyas. Philoxenus, unarmed, making a blessing gesture with the right hand. The Indo-Greeks may have ruled as far as the area of Mathura until sometime in the 1st century BCE: the Maghera inscription, from a village near Mathura, records the dedication of a well \\"in the one hundred and sixteenth year of the reign of the Yavanas\\", which could be as late as 70 BCE.The Sanskrit inscription reads \\"Yavanarajyasya sodasuttare varsasate 100 10 6\\". R.Salomon, \\"The Indo-Greek era of 186/5 B.C. in a Buddhist reliquary inscription\\", in \\"Afghanistan, ancien carrefour entre l'est et l'ouest\\", p373 Soon however Indian kings recovered the area of Mathura and south-eastern Punjab, west of the Yamuna River, and started to mint their own coins. The Arjunayanas (area of Mathura) and Yaudheyas mention military victories on their coins (\\"Victory of the Arjunayanas\\", \\"Victory of the Yaudheyas\\"). During the 1st century BCE, the Trigartas, Audumbaras and finally the Kunindas (closest to Punjab) also started to mint their own coins, usually in a style highly reminiscent of Indo-Greek coinage. The Western king Philoxenus briefly occupied most of the remaining Greek territory from the Paropamisadae to Western Punjab c. 100 BCE, after which the territories fragmented again. The following decades saw fierce internal fighting between several kings, such as Heliokles II, Strato I and Hermaeus, which contributed to the downfall in a manner perhaps reminiscent of how the Seleucid and Ptolemaic states were torn apart by dynastic wars at the same period. =The Yuezhi expansion (70 BCE‚Äì)= Philoxenus was succeeded by Diomedes, probably his son or younger brother, in the west, but his reign was short and he was succeeded by Hermaeus, a king married to the princess Calliope who was likely a daughter of Philoxenus.Senior, 2004 After a reign of at least one decade, Hermaeus was overthrown by nomad tribes, either the Yuezhi or Sakas Bopearachchi's and Senior's views, respectively. See for instance Bopearachchi, 1998, and Senior, 1998, When Hermaeus is depicted on his coins riding a horse, he is equipped with the recurve bow and bow-case of the steppes. In any case, these nomads became the new rulers of the Paropamisadae, and minted vast quantities of posthumous issues of Hermaeus up to around 40 CE, when they blend with the coinage of the Kushan king Kujula Kadphises. The first documented Yuezhi prince, Sapalbizes, ruled around 20 BCE, and minted in Greek and in the same style as the western Indo-Greek kings, probably depending on Greek mints and celators. =Scythian invasions (80 BCE ‚Äì 50 CE)= Tetradrachm of Hippostratos, reigned c. 65‚Äì55 BCE. Silver coin of the Indo-Scythian king Azes II (r. c. 35‚Äì12 BCE). Around 80 BCE, an Indo-Scythian king named Maues, possibly an ally of some of the Indo-Greeks kings, captured Taxila and ruled Gandhara for a few years. The king he dethroned was probably Archebius. After Maues' death, the Indo-Greeks were able to regain control of Taxila, but at this time the line between Greeks and Sakas may not have been that clear. Among the kings who emerged in Gandhara after Maues' death, Artemidoros who was seemingly a regular Indo-Greek king, presents himself as \\"son of Maues\\" on a bronze. This discovery caused a small sensation and has led scholars such as Senior R. C. Senior, 2004 and 1998. See also this source . to assume that also Hermaeus may have been of partly Saka origin. Another important king during this period was Amyntas, who issued the last Attic coins found in Bactria and may have attempted to reunite the Indo- Greek territories. It was however the king Apollodotus II, seemingly a descendant of Menander, who managed to regain Gandhara from remaining Greek strongholds in eastern Punjab. After the death of Apollodotus II the kingdom fragmented once more. In the west, he was succeeded by Hippostratos who was initially a successful ruler, but he was the last western ruler: around 55‚Äì50 BCE he was defeated by the Indo-Scythian Azes I, who established his own Indo- Scythian dynasty. Although the Indo-Scythians clearly ruled militarily and politically, they remained respectful of Greek and Indian cultures. Their coins were minted in Greek mints, continued using proper Greek and Kharoshthi legends, and incorporated depictions of Greek deities, particularly Zeus. The Mathura lion capital inscription attests that they adopted the Buddhist faith, as do the depictions of deities forming the vitarka mudra on their coins. Greek communities, far from being exterminated, probably persisted under Indo- Scythian rule. The Buner reliefs show Indo-Greeks and Indo-Scythians reveling in a Buddhist context. =The last eastern kingdom (50 BCE ‚Äì 10 CE)= The Indo-Greeks continued to maintain themselves in the eastern Punjab for several decades, until the kingdom of the last Indo-Greek king Strato II was taken over by the Indo-Scythian ruler Rajuvula around 10 CE. The coins of these Indo-Greek rulers deteriorated constantly, both in terms of artistic quality (due to the long isolation) and in silver content. Still, the last Strato had the honour of ruling the last pocket of an independent Hellenistic state; when he disappeared, Cleopatra, usually seen as the last of the rulers who followed Alexander the Great, was already gone. =Indo-Parthian rule (10‚Äì60 CE)= Indo-Parthian king and attendants. Ancient Orient Museum. The Parthians, represented by the Suren, a noble Parthian family of Arsacid descent, started to make inroads into the territories which had been occupied by the Indo- Scythians and the Yuezhi, until the demise of the last Indo-Scythian emperor Azes II around 12 BCE. The Parthians ended up controlling all of Bactria and extensive territories in Northern India, after fighting many local rulers such as the Kushan Empire ruler Kujula Kadphises, in the Gandhara region. Around 20, Gondophares, one of the Parthian conquerors, declared his independence from the Parthian empire and established the Indo-Parthian kingdom in the conquered territories, with his capital in ancient Taxila. =Kushan supremacy= A Yuezhi/ Kushan man in traditional costume with tunic and boots, 2nd century CE, Gandhara. The Yuezhi expanded to the east during the 1st century CE, to found the Kushan Empire. The first Kushan emperor Kujula Kadphises ostensibly associated himself with Hermaeus on his coins, suggesting that he may have been one of his descendants by alliance, or at least wanted to claim his legacy. The Yuezhi (future Kushans) were in many ways the cultural and political heirs to the Indo-Greeks, as suggested by their adoption of the Greek culture (writing system, Greco-Buddhist art) and their claim to a lineage with the last western Indo-Greek king Hermaeus. The last known mention of an Indo-Greek ruler is suggested by an inscription on a signet ring of the 1st century CE in the name of a king Theodamas, from the Bajaur area of Gandhara, in modern Pakistan. No coins of him are known, but the signet bears in kharoshthi script the inscription \\"Su Theodamasa\\", \\"Su\\" being explained as the Greek transliteration of the ubiquitous Kushan royal title \\"Shau\\" (\\"Shah\\", \\"King\\"). The Indo-Greek rulers \\"Indo-Greek\\" kings are distinguished from \\"Bactrian\\" kings in that they issued dominantly bilingual coinage, meant for circulation outside the Hindu Kush. However, Demetrius I is usually included (though he issued no such coins) and some mainly Bactrian kings who also held Indian territories. The chronology is tentative, as are the territories. This overview largely gives the chronology of Senior (2004) while most of the territories are adapted from Bopearachchi (1991). The views of both authors, as well as other alternatives, are given under each king. =The Bactrian period (c. 200‚Äì130 BCE)= Territories of Arachosia, Paropamisadae, Gandhara? Euthydemus I and Demetrius I (c. 200‚Äì175 BCE) Coins. Demetrius was the first Indo-Greek king to gain territories in India. It is possible that he made his first conquests as general for his father, a view supported by the Heliodorus inscription. Demetrius I, founder of the Indo-Greek kingdom (r. c. 205‚Äì171 BCE). Territories of Paropamisadae, Gandhara * Pantaleon * Agathocles Coins. These two Bactrian kings, likely father and son, ruled between c. 190‚Äì175 BCE.

It was founded in 1083 by Altmann, Bishop of Passau. History Abbey Church and Cloister G√∂ttweig Abbey library G√∂ttweig Abbey was founded as a monastery of canons regular by Blessed Altmann (c. 1015-1091), Bishop of Passau. The high altar of a chapel was dedicated in 1072, but the monastery itself not until 1083:\\"G√∂ttweig Abbey\\", Donau Niederosterreich the foundation charter, dated 9 September 1083, is still preserved in the abbey archives. By 1094 the discipline of the community had become so lax that Bishop Ulrich of Passau, with the permission of Pope Urban II, introduced the Rule of St. Benedict. Prior Hartmann of St. Blaise's Abbey in the Black Forest was elected abbot. He brought with him from St. Blaise's a number of chosen monks, among whom were Blessed Wirnto and Blessed Berthold, later abbots of Formbach and Garsten respectively. Under Hartmann (1094-1114) G√∂ttweig became a famous seat of learning and strict monastic observance. He founded a monastic school, organized a library, and at the foot of the hill built a nunnery where it is believed that Ava, the earliest German language poetess known by name (d. 1127), lived as an anchorite. The nunnery, which was afterwards transferred to the top of the hill, continued to exist until 1557. During the 15th and 16th centuries however the abbey declined so that between 1556 and 1564 it had no abbot at all, and in 1564 not a single monk was left here. At this crisis an imperial deputation arrived at G√∂ttweig, and elected Michael Herrlich, a monk of Melk Abbey, as abbot. The new abbot, who held his office until 1603, restored the monastery spiritually and financially, and rebuilt it after it had been almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1580. Abbots distinguished during the Reformation were George Falb (1612-1631) and David Corner (1631-1648), who successfully opposed the spread of Protestantism in the district. In 1718 the monastery burnt down and was rebuilt on a grander scale during the abbacy of Gottfried Bessel (1714-1749) to designs by Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt inspired by the Escorial. The fresco decorating the imperial staircase is considered a masterpiece of Baroque architecture in Austria. Executed by Paul Troger in 1739, it represents the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI as Apollo. The abbey has a library of 150,000 books and manuscripts, and a particularly important collection of religious engravings, besides valuable collections of coins, antiquities, musical manuscripts and natural history, all of which survived the dangers of World War II and its immediate aftermath almost without loss. Since 1625 the abbey has been a member of the Austrian Congregation, now within the Benedictine Confederation, the monks number about 45. The abbey is part of the Wachau, a UNESCO World Heritage landscape.

Vitallium was developed by Albert W. Merrick for the Austenal Laboratories in 1932. Subperiosteal maxillary implant made of vitallium 1977 In 2016 Norman Sharp, a 91-year-old British man, was recognised as having the world's oldest hip replacement implants. The two Vitallium implants were implanted in November 1948 at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, under the newly formed NHS. The 67-year-old implants had such an unusually long life, partly because they had not required the typical replacement of such implants, but also because of Sharp's young age of 23 when they were implanted, owing to a childhood case of septic arthritis. For high- temperature use in engines, particularly turbochargers, the first alloy used was Haynes Stellite No. 21, similar to Vitallium. This was suggested by the British engineer, and denture wearer, S.D. Heron during World War II. Although the characteristics of the material obviously suggested itself for making turbocharger blades, it was thought impossible to cast it to the precision needed. Heron demonstrated that it could be, by showing his Vitallium dentures.

She is a female ninja of Japanese origin and a supporting character of the X-Men, particularly associated with Wolverine.James Egan, 1000 Facts about Comic Books, Vol. 3 (2016), p. 87. She was portrayed by Rila Fukushima in the 2013 film The Wolverine, and her teenage version by Shiori Kutsuna in the 2018 film Deadpool 2. Publication history Yukio's first full appearance was in Wolverine #2 (September 1982), created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Frank Miller. Character history The X-Men's first encounter with Yukio occurred when Wolverine had his struggle with Shingen Yashida, father of Wolverine's girlfriend Mariko Yashida. At that time Yukio worked for Shingen, and one of her tasks was to kill Wolverine. Instead she developed a crush on him and subsequently aided him in bringing about Shingen's downfall.Wolverine #1-4 (1982). Later, Wolverine invited his team to Japan for his wedding to Mariko, which Yukio joined subsequently. Viper and the Silver Samurai poisoned the X-Men during a dinner that Logan hosted for them. Logan, tasting the poison, warned Ororo and knocked the cup from her hand before she could drink it. While the others were recuperating from the attack, Storm, Wolverine, Rogue (who had been largely unaffected), and Yukio went after Viper and the Silver Samurai to stop his plot to assassinate Mariko, who was his half- sister. Yukio posed as a decoy, disguising herself as Mariko to lead them away from her. During their altercation with Viper and Silver Samurai, Storm found her powers inexplicably going out of control, endangering her life. Yukio knocked Storm into the nearby bay, enabling them to escape from the Silver Samurai. (These events had actually been brought about and influenced by the mutant villain Mastermind, who was conducting a revenge campaign against the X-Men at the time. He was also responsible for the subsequent halting of Wolverine's and Mariko's wedding). Storm, inspired by what she called Yukio's \\"madness\\" and lust for life, changed her image dramatically and adopted a new look: a mohawk haircut, studded collar, and black leather clothing.Uncanny X-Men #172-173 Yukio later met up, once again, with Wolverine to help him fight the ninja master Ogun.\\"Kitty Pryde & Wolverine.\\" She developed a rivalry with the X-Man Gambit: Both being thieves, they often tried to steal the same object. Yukio once framed Gambit for a crime she committed.\\"Wolverine and Gambit\\". Yukio is also part of Professor X's secret information network of humans and mutants, known as the Mutant Underground (not to be confused with Cable's Underground). After the death of Mariko Yashida, Wolverine sent his adopted daughter, Amiko Kobayashi, to a foster family. He later discovered that her new foster parents were abusive and only interested in the money. Wolverine took Amiko away from them and asked Yukio to raise her. This unofficial adoption was under the protection of the Silver Samurai, now an ally of Wolverine. Yukio trained Amiko in the martial arts and to her own surprise she enjoyed her new role as a mother. When Sabretooth targeted Wolverine's friends and family, he hired Omega Red and Lady Deathstrike to kidnap Amiko. Yukio fought the two, but was overpowered and seriously injured, and left her in a wheelchair. She asked Wolverine to kill her, but Wolverine refused and saved Amiko shortly afterwards. Yukio reappeared and was fully recovered from her previous injuries.X-treme X-Men Arena storyline. She teamed up with Storm again to enter the Arena, a fight club for mutants. In the end, Yukio, Storm, and Callisto took over the Arena. Later, Yukio and Amiko were attacked by Hellverine (a demonic being who had taken over Wolverine's body in order to kill his loved ones) on the behest of Marduk Kurios. Her confusion over the fake Wolverine's behavior earned Yukio serious injuries, but Amiko returned from school just in time to save them both from Hellverine.Wolverine vol. 4 #2. When Wolverine goes back to Japan to stop a war between the Hand and the Yakuza, Yukio is shown to be once again in a wheelchair due to Hellverine's attack.Wolveine vol. 4 #300. As part of the All-New, All- Different Marvel event, Yukio is shown running an illegal nightclub in Osaka, Japan when it is visited by War Machine where he asks her about the tech-based ninjas. Yukio states that she can't say anything if she wants her business to stay afloat. After being threatened with the prospect of having the Avengers storming the place, Yukio points War Machine to a rather big and muscular man in a tuxedo who leaves the nightclub with two ladies entering the car with him.Invincible Iron Man Vol. 2 #6. Characteristics and abilities Within the context of the stories, Yukio is an occasional thief by profession, as well as a r≈çnin, a masterless samurai. Yukio has been portrayed as a free spirit with an almost careless disregard for personal safety. According to her own philosophy of life, living in danger is the ultimate adventure, while the peace of death is the final prize that awaits for every person who has truly lived.Wolverine #3. In 2011, UGO Networks featured her on their list of 25 Hot Ninja Girls, commenting: \\"While her short, black haircut and skin-tight leather outfit make her come off as a nefarious addition to the X-Men world, Yukio has proven to be quite a helpful non-mutant to Wolverine and his friends.\\" While Yukio is highly skilled in the martial arts, her specialty weapons are scalpel-like shuriken, of which she can hurl up to three at a time with deadly accuracy. Wolverine once joked that Yukio's real first name was \\"Yukiko\\".Wolverine: Soultaker miniseries.

With respect to her appearance in Deadpool 2, Sergio Pereira, writing for Screen Rant, felt that Kutsuna's portrayal of Yukio was bad for the character and the franchise, stating that \\"[a]ll of the character development and progress from The Wolverine is washed away as Yukio becomes a parody of herself\\". Writing for Bustle, Olivia Truffaut-Wong said that the Deadpool 2 Yukio \\"doesn't really seem to have a life outside of being one half of the first gay superhero couple onscreen... nor does she have a personality that goes beyond typical depictions of a cute Japanese anime character\\", although she does note the significance of the character appearing as being in a relationship.

As a retrovirus, it has a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome which replicates via a DNA intermediate mediated by a reverse transcriptase. The Abelson murine leukemia virus is named for the American pediatrician Herbert T. Abelson, who together with Louise S Rabstein, first described and isolated it. A-MuLV causes a rapidly progressive lymphosarcoma known as Abelson disease in mice, which is a type of leukemia that does not involve the thymus. However, this is only possible when the host cell is co-infected with a helper virus which provides functions it needs to be able to replicate which it does not code for in its own genome such as a reverse transcriptase and some major structural proteins. As such, A-MuLV can be described as a dependovirus. A highly efficient helper virus commonly used when growing A-MuLV in vitro is Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). It causes leukemia directly by interfering with the normal growth and differentiation processes of lymphocytes. It can infect B-cells which was shown by the fact that some tumor cells can be seen to have immunoglobulins (Ig) on their surface although most tumor cells do not have characteristic receptors on their surface indicating that they are undifferentiated cells. In vitro studies have shown that lymphocyte infection produces tumor cell populations comprising three types of cells: stable productive cells, non-productive cells and cells which produced defective virus particles which are not infective.

She contested Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber at the 1997 general election; where she finished in fourth place with a 17.5% share of the vote and received 8,355 votes. She resigned from her list seat to contest the 2006 Moray by-election caused by the death of Scottish National Party MSP Margaret Ewing, but was defeated in the by-election by Richard Lochhead of the SNP. During the campaign, the decision to keep the word \\"Conservative\\" off her election material proved controversial. She was embroiled in further controversy when it emerged that letters apparently backing her candidacy from local independent councillors were not authorised. Her list seat was taken up by Dave Petrie. She was returned to Parliament on the list vote in the 2007 election after failing to win the 2006 by-election. She was again re-elected in 2011.

It is adapted to survive in Arctic conditions, specifically tundras. Distribution The Arctic willow grows in tundra and rocky moorland, and is the northernmost woody plant in the world, occurring far above the tree line to the northern limit of land on the north coast of Greenland. It also occurs further south in North America on high-altitude alpine tundra, south to the Sierra Nevada in California and the Rocky Mountains in New Mexico, to Xinjiang in China in Asia.Salicaceae of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: Salix arctica Flora Europaea: Salix arctica Description S. arctica is typically a low shrub growing to only in height (rarely to high), but in the Pacific Northwest, it may reach in height, and has round, shiny green leaves long and broad; they are pubescent, with long, silky, silvery hairs. Like the rest of the willows, Arctic willow is dioecious, with male and female catkins on separate plants. As a result, the plant's appearance varies; the female catkins are red-coloured, while the male catkins are yellow-coloured.Jepson Flora: Salix arctica Despite its small size, it is a long-lived plant, growing extremely slowly in the severe arctic climate; one in eastern Greenland was found to be 236 years old. Hybrids with Salix arcticola and Salix glauca are known. Ecology The Arctic willow is a food source for several Arctic animals. Muskoxen, caribou, Arctic hares, and lemmings all feed on the bark and twigs, while the buds are the main food source of the rock ptarmigan. It is the primary host plant and food source for the Arctic woolly bear moth, Gynaephora groenlandica. Uses Both the Inuit and the Gwich‚Äôin make use of this willow. Twigs are used as fuel, while the decayed flowers (suputiit) are mixed with moss and used as wicking in the kudlik. The plant was used for several medicinal purposes, such as relieving toothache, helping to stop bleeding, curing diarrhoea and indigestion, and as a poultice on wounds. Both the Gwich‚Äôin and Inuit in the Bathurst Inlet area were known to eat parts of the Arctic willow, which is high in vitamin C and tastes sweet.Flora of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago , S.G.

He was noted by Samuel Johnson, and associated with the surgical mistreatment of Handel, Bach, and perhaps hundreds of others.  Career  Taylor was born in Norwich, studied in London under the pioneering British surgeon William Cheselden at St Thomas' Hospital, and by 1727 had produced a book, An Account of the Mechanism of the Eye, dedicated to Cheselden. While his practice grew, operating on celebrities of the time such as Edward Gibbon, making the acquaintance of Viennese courtier and patron of composers Gottfried van Swieten, and being appointed royal eye surgeon to King George II, his flair for self-promotion grew with it, then beyond it. He dubbed himself \\"Chevalier\\". He toured Europe in a coach painted with images of eyes, performing the ancient technique of couching cataracts and other techniques in something like an eye surgery travelling medicine show, with claims, treatments, and payments coordinated for an easy exit out of town. In his expansive 1761 autobiography in two volumes, The Life and Extraordinary History of the Chevalier John Taylor, Taylor styled himself \\"Ophthalmiater (sic) Pontifical, Imperial, Royal.\\" Taylor's career was destructive. Taylor‚Äôs general approach included bloodletting, laxatives, and eyedrops of blood from slaughtered pigeons, pulverized sugar, or baked salt. Some time in late March 1750, during one of his European tours, Taylor operated on Bach's cataracts twice in Leipzig and reportedly blinded him. Bach fell ill with a fever soon after his second operation and passed away less than four months later. There is some evidence that Taylor operated on Handel in August 1758, in Tunbridge Wells, after which Handel's health deteriorated until his death in April 1759. In both cases Taylor claimed complete success. Prior to performing each surgical procedure, he would deliver a long, self- promoting speech in an unusual oratorial style. Dutch ophthalmologist R. Zegers mentions that \\"after his training, Taylor started practicing in Switzerland, where he blinded hundreds of patients, he once confessed\\". Writer Samuel Johnson said of Taylor that his life showed \\"an instance of how far impudence may carry ignorance.\\" Taylor died in obscurity in 1772, after spending the last years of his life completely blind. However, the musicologist Charles Burney claims that he died on the morning of Friday 16 November 1770 in Rome, also claiming to have \\"dined with him at my table d'hote a few days before his death\\".

The song was released as a single on March 13, 1991 by Giant Records. The song was produced by Foster. The group of people involved was also collectively known as Voices That Care and was shown as such on the single release and marketing materials. The charity single and supporting documentary music video were intended to help boost the morale of U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm, as well as supporting the International Red Cross organization. The documentary, which followed the recording of the single to the music video's presentation to the troops in the Middle East, aired on Fox on February 28, 1991, coincidentally the day fighting in Desert Storm ended. \\"Voices That Care\\" reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 6 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. Warren Wiebe, a friend of Foster and little-known vocalist at the time who recorded the demo of the song, was invited by Foster to sing lead and deliver the last solo lines of the song. Wiebe died on October 25, 1998 (aged 45).

It was released in 1993 through Lookout! Records. It is often considered one of the band's best albums. Album trivia Anthem for a New Tomorrow was recorded after the Screeching Weasel returned from their 1993 U.S. tour, which was their last. The liner notes of the album read \\"Hey! You've heard them, now go SEE them!\\" The title is taken from the song \\"Second Floor East\\" from their previous album, Wiggle. Mass Giorgini recorded the album at his Sonic Iguana Studio. All songs on the album were taken from this session except \\"Every Night\\" and \\"Totally\\", which the band felt were better represented by demo recordings they'd done months earlier at Flat Iron Studios with Andy Ernst. After their last album, the band lost bassist Johnny Personality. Rather than find a replacement, guitarist Danny Vapid switched to bass and Ben Weasel took over second guitar. This later came to be known as the band's \\"classic\\" lineup. In contrast with the albums and EPs that preceded Anthem for a New Tomorrow, the vast majority of the writing was done by Ben Weasel alone. Only one song, \\"Trance,\\" out of 18 was co-written with bassist Danny Vapid. Vapid later remarked that \\"to suggest anything else would've ruined the mix.\\" The album has been described by the band as a concept album, dealing with issues of alienation, paranoia, and isolation in modern society. In the liner notes of the Asian Man released version of the album, Weasel and Vapid both say the sound of the album was heavily influenced by Wire's Pink Flag. Weasel has said that he wanted the album to sound \\"like a panic attack.\\" Ben Weasel with Screeching Weasel at Reggie's Rock Club, Chicago in February 2010 The album was remastered and re-released by Asian Man Records in 2005.

In the accompanying TV commercial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKR1ScQUpcA there was almost no mention of food. Instead, the ad featured an all-male McDonald's cleaning crew, singing after-hours about their individual tasks, and emphasizing that \\"at McDonald's it's clean!\\" just before launching into the almost operatic chorus: \\"You deserve a break today / So get up and get away / To McDonald's!\\" Another well known jingle was the \\"McDonald's is your kind of place / It's such a happy place / Hap, hap, hap, happy place...\\" from 1967, sung to the tune of \\"Down by the Riverside\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFEkfipbI3Q&NR;=1 =Big Mac= English (1974-) Portuguese (1987-) Russian (1990-) =\\"McDonald's and You!\\" (1983‚Äì1984)= =\\"It's a good time for the great taste\\" (1984‚Äì1988)= There is also a full version used in one commercial. =Good Time, Great Taste (1988‚Äì1990)= There is also a full version sung by Ronald McDonald, some kids, and the McDonaldland gang in one commercial. =A Visit to McDonald's Makes Your Day (UK, 1988-1991)= =Food, Folks and Fun (1990-1991)= There is also a full version used in one commercial. =McDonald's Today (1991-1992)= =What you want is what you get (1992-1994)= There was also an extended version used in one commercial which goes like this: There was also a full version used in 25 years of The best of McDonald's on TV VHS which goes like this: =Have you had your break today? (1995-1997)= =Have you had your break today? (Big Mac/Canadian version, 1995-1997)= There was also a Canadian version that also promoted the Big Mac. =Livet har sina goda stunder= This campaign was used in Sweden in 1996 and was recorded by Swedish band Ultima Thule. =Every time a good time= This campaign was used in Germany in 1999 and was originally recorded by Billy White and Patricia Darcy Jones.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtrpaL2JoEw The campaign was also used in the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Sweden, Taiwan, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong. =I'm lovin' it (2003‚Äìpresent)= There are also two full versions sung by Justin Timberlake. The first one was used in one commercial. The second one was used in one commercial. =McDonald's menu song= The McDonald's $1,000,000 Menu Song was an instant-win promotion created as part of an advertising campaign, which ran from 1988 to early 1989. As the name suggests, the song, which was based on Reunion's 1974 hit single \\"Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)\\", incorporates all of the items (at that time) on the McDonald's menu: sandwiches, other lunch/dinner items, breakfast items, dessert items, and drinks, in that order. Promotion overview Either flexi-discs or cardboard records containing the song were attached to advertising inserts and distributed within newspapers across the United States. On all but one of the issued recordings, the singers were not able to recite the song perfectly from start to finish; when the singers made a mistake, the record was over. On the unique, prize-winning recording, the singers were able to complete the song; this record was a $1,000,000 instant winner. Approximately 80 million records were distributed, and only one of them was a winner. The promotion was won by Galax, Virginia, resident Charlene Price, who used the money to purchase the convenience store where she worked. =United States= In the United States, the lyrics read as follows: =Canada= In Canada, the lyrics were as follows: =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong, the lyrics were as follows: Qu√©bec Around the same time (1989‚Äì90), a French version of the ad campaign was produced for Quebec; however, no promotion was attached.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpn7ncrmwL0 The order given in this version was sandwiches, other lunch/dinner items, dessert items, drinks, and breakfast.

It is the world's tallest hotel. The tower was originally to be , but design modification reduced it to 333m or 1093ft Construction on the tower began in 2004 and was completed in 2007. The design and build contractor was the Arabian Construction Co. On 24 October 2006, the building reached its full height with the addition of the spire. By total height with spire, the hotel surpassed the nearby Burj Al Arab. Although the building and its inner furnishings were in place in 2007, it did not open until December 23, 2009. The hotel‚Äôs form is stylistically varied. The highly embellished fa√ßade is composed of two tones of blue and silver mirrored glass with gold ornamentation. A narrow panel of oculiform gold rings stretches up the center of each elevation. Each side of the tower incorporates two convex cylindrical forms that fold into one another. Fa√ßade sections flatten towards the top and reach up into an elaborate sculptural peak of intersecting petals, a visual reference to the building‚Äôs informal name, ‚ÄúThe Rose.‚Äù This floral element crowning the tower is topped by a sphere. A spire extending up from the roof is the ultimate pinnacle of the tower making its height extend to 359m high. Rose Rayhaan by Rotana is one of the first major hotel brands to open in Dubai as alcohol-free. The hotel has two restaurants and a 24-hour coffee shop. Bonyan International Investment Group is the developer and invested $180 million. The building was officially completed with 462 rooms, suites and penthouses. It officially opened on 23 December 2009.

It was the first feature film to star comedian Steve Coogan. The film follows a diverse group of former criminals as they assist their probation officer in proving his innocence after a murder accusation. Plot Simon Garden is a well-meaning but ineffectual probation officer. At the beginning of the film, he is facing a tribunal after all of his colleagues in his department in Blackpool submit complaints against him, Garden having had only three successes in his career. He is transferred to Manchester. He has hypoglycemia and regularly eats crisps to deal with it. In Manchester, he starts his new role and meets an attractive WPC, Emma. While looking into the case of a \\"client\\", Kirsty, a juvenile delinquent who had had Class A drugs planted on her, Simon witnesses the murder of an accountant by corrupt police officer Detective Inspector Burton. He is discovered, chased from the building by two bouncers and after being cornered, ends up falling into a canal. He has inadvertently left his wallet containing identification at the crime scene and is duly framed for the accountant's murder by DI Burton. Simon goes to the police with the story, but ends up being interviewed by Burton, who is leading the investigation. He releases Simon, but threatens him with prison unless he keeps quiet about the officer's drugs scam and the murder. Simon first decides to leave Manchester for good and, feeling down, rejects the offer of a meal from Emma. While away from the city, he walks past a shop where the TV in the window happens to be showing an interview with Burton, who will be receiving a bravery award. It triggers his memory of the murder ‚Äì he realises that a CCTV camera had filmed the whole event. He realises that this security tape will clear his name and show that Burton was the real murderer. He returns to the club where the murder took place to try to find the tape, only to discover that it has been taken to a bank and placed in a safety deposit box. Simon sets out to round up his four successful ex-clients. He visits George in Blackpool and convinces him to join the plan. They recruit Jeff, who has been working as a fishmonger, and Colin, who has been working in a computer shop. They visit the home of the former master-criminal Viktor, only to find his wife and his grave; his wife takes them to Viktor's secret underground workshop and says they can take whatever equipment they want from his extensive selection of technology and safe-cracking kit. The team gathers in Simon's house and they set out to devise a cunning plan to retrieve the tape from the bank. One evening they find that Kirsty, Simon's first client when he started his new job in Manchester, has broken in and is attempting to steal his television. When she sees what they are doing, she asks to join the gang to rob the bank, but Simon says she is too young. They tell her she has to leave but she convinces them that she will be small enough to slip through a vent that someone needs to access as part of their heist plan. The team members train together, organise equipment, deploy a computer virus, and invent a GOTLER (George-operated time-lock equalising robot). Over time they bond as a group, have fun together, and formulate their plan. However, one night, DI Burton and several police officers (including Emma) search the house for the head of the murdered accountant. DI Burton has obviously planted it in Simon's house and, despite Kirsty's attempt to dispose of it, manages to frame Simon and the others: they are arrested, and end up in a police cell. Kirsty is taken away by the police, but manages to slip away from them at a garage. Simon tries to explain to Emma about the plan to clear his name but, because she feels that he has hidden things from her, she is reluctant to listen. Simon, George, Colin, and Jeff are in their cell wondering what to do when the back of a van crashes through the wall ‚Äì it is Kirsty, who has stolen a van and is rescuing them. They jump in and speed off with Kirsty at the wheel, determined to try to get to the bank and put the plan into action. Once there, they sneak on to the roof, activate all of Manchester's alarms, and climb into the building. Simon uses the robot to activate the door, and they grab the tape. A man in disguise, who is apparently Victor, turns up, but the group is collecting money as well, before he vanishes. Once the job is done, the group flees from the bank. They finally arrive at the town hall, where DI Burton is earning a bravery award for saving Kirsty from a burning car earlier in the film. Despite being attacked by Burton's sidekicks, Simon finally proves his innocence by revealing the tape to the public, and Burton is arrested. Amidst the celebrations, Simon and Emma link with each other and kiss.

Critical reception The film currently has a 67% rating on the reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.The Parole Office at Rotten Tomatoes, URL accessed 29 June 2010 Most reviews favourably compared the film to Ealing Studios' heist comedies of the 1950s and 60s, although noted aspects of vulgarity. For example, Philip French, writing in The Observer stated \\"The film is mildly amusing and more than competently acted [but] contains very little that's original and nothing that throws any light on contemporary life. Indeed, all that distinguishes Coogan's film from British heist pictures of the 1950s and 1960s is the vulgarity and excursions into grossness.\\"Philip French, Review in The Observer, Sunday 12 August 2001 Similarly, Neil Smith, writing for BBC Movies online noted \\"What follows mixes the light-hearted antics of The Lavender Hill Mob with such high brow gags as Simon chundering on a roller- coaster or disposing of a phallus sculpture in a ladies' loo.\\" Derek Elley, writing the Variety was also complimentary, noting \\"Though much of the film revolves round the persona of Coogan...overall it's more of an ensemble piece than a one-man showcase, and better for it.\\"Derek Elley, Review in Variety, 9 August 2001 Steve Coogan, speaking of the film of which he was the star in The Guardian Online, said \\"Whenever I think of The Parole Officer, I squirm. And when someone says they like it, I think, ‚ÄúReally, why?‚Äù I‚Äôm pleased that they like it, but it‚Äôs like a children‚Äôs film.\\"Zoe Williams, \\"Steve Coogan Answers Your Questions\\" in The Guardian Online, Sunday 4 October 2015 References External links * 2001 films 2001 comedy films English-language films British comedy films British films DNA Films films Films scored by Alex Heffes Films set in Blackpool Films set in Manchester Films directed by John Duigan Malware in fiction ","title":"The Parole Officer"},{"id":"3824582","text":"The Color Changin' Click, is a local hip hop group formed in 2001 by Chamillionaire and Paul Wall. The group disbanded in 2005. Chamillionaire and Paul were part of a group prior to Color Changing Click called The Sleepwalkers. It's unclear if there were 3 or 4 members of the group, but PKT (short for Pimp Killa Thug) was definitely part of the group. Not much more is known about the group other than they used to open up for Swishahouse members prior to being in Swishahouse themselves. Biography =Chamillionaire and Paul Wall= Friends since childhood, Paul and Chamillionaire broke into the music industry by doing promotions for various southern hip-hop entities such as Cash Money Records. Eventually, they got jobs doing promotions for Swishahouse. While there, they recorded a demo for Swishahouse that gained a lot of attention, and soon people wanted to know who made it. Paul and Chamillionaire kept asking Swishahouse CEO Michael 5000 Watts to let them get a couple of verses on some mixtapes. However, they were constantly put to the side for other artists, and when they did get a chance to perform, they weren't getting paid well. Eventually, Paul and Chamillionaire decided to break out on their own and left Swishahouse. The pair signed with Paid in Full Entertainment, a record label owned by the Madd Hatta, and released Get Ya Mind Correct in 2002. It was an instant hit in Houston, selling over 150,000 copies independently and getting nominated by the Source as one of the finalists for the indie album of the year in 2002. However, disputes over artistic direction led to friction between the two. They were set to release their second album, Controversy Sells, but the lingering issues led the group to split before the album saw the light of day. Controversy Sells did eventually get released in 2005. Paul decided to return to Swishahouse, while Chamillionaire started his own label, Chamillitary Entertainment. His younger brother Rasaq, Yung Ro, 50/50 Lil' Twin, and OG Ron C were signed to the label. Their relationship was further strained by Paul's friendship with Mike Jones. Chamillionaire claims that Jones was saying foul things behind his back while being cool with him in person. After a short lived feud with Jones, and a \\"disagreement\\" with Paul Wall, Chamillionaire has since made peace with both artists. Paul Wall and Chamillionaire have performed together since, and collabed soon after on Paul Wall's song, Diamonds Exposed, with Lil Keke \\"the Don\\" or also known as \\"Don Ke\\".

It includes the character Debbie from her previous novel, All Alone in the Universe, but introduces several new characters, primarily her neighborhood friends Hector, Lenny and Phil. Plot This story takes place in Seldem, during spring and summer. It follows the criss-crossing stories of a group of middle-school children. A necklace plays a significant part in all of the criss-cross moments, helping the characters in the book to find their true selves, giving the novel a touch of magic realism. Debbie usually spends time with her four friends, Patty, Hector, Lenny, and Phil. A typical summer for them would be to hang around town and sit in Lenny's dad's pickup truck, listening to the radio. During this summer vacation, however, Debbie moved into the front of their family parlor, and she has her own room. She then gets a job helping an elderly woman. She meets her boss' grandson, Peter, and they share a quick, romantic week together. Soon after he leaves back to his town in California. All of the friends go through their own changes throughout the summer and each grow in their own way. In the end, to tie up their summer, they all have a block party, and are now more mature, and use their new knowledge to move along in life. Reception Kirkus Reviews described Criss Cross as \\"A tenderly existential work that will reward more thoughtful readers in this age of the ubiquitous action saga.\\" According to The Horn Book Magazine, \\"In idiosyncratic, wistful prose, Perkins mines every moment of missed connection and near-change with a hypnotic hyperawareness reminiscent of adolescence itself.\\" In 2008, Anita Silvey, author of 100 Best Books for Children, described Criss Cross in a School Library Journal article as one of several recent Newbery winners considered \\"particularly disappointing\\" by public librarians.

History William Hulme, founder of the William Hulme Charity, lived 1631-1691 in Hulme Hall, Stockport. Following the premature death of his son, he left provision for the foundation of exhibitions for four students to study for Bachelor of Arts degrees at Brasenose College in Oxford. The income for this charity was originally ¬£64, which came from rents and dues on his many outlying properties. Over the years, this sum grew so much that on several occasions it was necessary to extend the scope of his bequest. In 1881, the Trustees of his charity were empowered to build schools in Manchester, Oldham and Bury. The Manchester school was founded on 26 January 1887 as a grammar school.The Hulmeian, March 1956 (vol.XIII no. 14) Originally named The Hulme Grammar School, in 1939 it changed its name to William Hulme's Grammar School.<\\"The Hulmeian\\", January 1940 (vol. 10 no. 10)' Until 1975 it was a direct grant school; when this scheme was abolished, it chose to become independent. In 2006, the school announced that it was joining the state sector, abolishing all tuition fees and selection. It applied for and gained academy status, making it more independent than most state schools by allowing for the selection of up to 10% of students based on aptitude in foreign languages. It is the first member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of top independent schools to opt into the state sector. In 2007, the school announced that plans to become an Academy had been finalised and that the United Learning Trust had signed the contract. Plans for extensive building work were revealed, backed by a ¬£10 million investment. Building work, which involved a complete renovation and extension of the Donner Block and the demolition of the Art and Design building, was completed within 2 years. In 2014, the school announced an extension to expand its capacity, including a new Preparatory building. An annual intake of 150 students will begin from the 2015‚Äì2016 academic year. In March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the school was shut, along with all of the schools in the UK and abroad, leaving students into home learning. Earlier before, some students have to be absent if they have one of the symptoms, as part of the coronavirus and will self-isolate. As instructed by the government, the school was closed for students until further notice. Buildings =Old Building= The north face of the Old Building looking towards the front of the School The original part of the school was designed by A. H. Davies-Colley in 1886‚Äì1887 as a large, high (up to four storeys) building of red brick and yellow terracotta. There is a hall of c.1910 in the same style. Both buildings are symmetrical. The building lies on top of a large tunnel network. In the original building, there is a ground floor hall surrounded by balconies on many levels. The main staircase is opposed by large stained glass windows. The basement level was refurbished on one side in 2007 in order to allow lessons to be held in two small classrooms. At the front of the school in the basement are the staff changing rooms and medical centre. The stage of the main hall lies opposite the hall entrance, above which are a number of oil paintings of previous headmasters. A portrait of Patriarca was commissioned in 2008. Around the oak-panelled walls of the hall are boards bearing the names of old boys who have been awarded Scholarships or Exhibitions to Oxford or Cambridge, long serving teachers and all past headmasters. Above these are numerous house flags and shields. On the west wall is the stage staff balcony. Beneath the balcony is the organ. There is also a fairly new grand piano which is frequently used for public concerts and recitals. Beneath the main hall was originally the changing rooms but is now the music department which is equipped with an older grand piano in the rehearsal studio, along with several upright pianos and a number of computers and keyboards. =Science Block= Leaving the old building from the back, one enters the north quad. Opposite is the science block, which was built in 1927. It houses approximately 10 Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Geology laboratories and also classrooms for Sports Science, Economics and Business Studies, along with the Activities Studio. There are darkroom facilities within the physics department. It has been extended twice. The first extension, in the 1940s, added 4 labs at the north end of the building. Its purpose, according to the Headmaster at the time, was to \\"prosecute study and further the development of truth; if that can't be done, what else is there?\\" The second extension was in January 1985. The gap at the back between the then-Donner library and the 'old' biology laboratory was filled to give a new biology lab and a multi-purpose large lab. The latter of these was refurbished in 2002 as the Dr Barnes Laboratory, in memory of Dr David Barnes, head of physics, who died suddenly whilst training in 2000. View of the Science Block in front of the Main Building. Astroturf in foreground and Donner Block (in construction) on left. Taken from original 1st XI cricket square =Donner Block= On the other side of the north quad is the Donner block, named after Sir Edward Donner, a benefactor of the school. It was built as an extension to the technology building in the mid 20th century. In 2007/8 it was completely gutted and rebuilt. The new building includes the dining hall, most of the central offices for the Secondary Phase and classrooms for the Mathematics, History, Geography, Religious Studies, Food Technology, Art and Design Technology departments, as well as staff and sixth form common rooms. =South Quad= On the other side of the Donner Block is the south quad. This is surrounded by the Donner Block, the Learning Resources Centre (library), the Performing Arts Centre (PAC) and the Zochonis Centre. =Zochonis Centre= The Zochonis Centre contains the English, Modern Foreign Languages, Latin, Classics, EAL, ICT and Learning Support Departments. =Learning Resources Centre= The Donner Library, now renamed the Learning Resources Centre moved to the previous VIth form common room in 2007. This is its third location - it has previously occupied what is now the Mathematics department and the Donner block first floor. The old Junior Library was housed in the basement of the old building underneath room 7, in what is now the CCF stores =Sports facilities= Behind the academic buildings, and backing onto Princess Road are the sports facilities. There is a sports hall with full cricket nets, gymnasium and changing rooms as well as a more modern pavilion/changing room suite. A full-size AstroTurf pitch with adjacent netball courts was built in 2002‚Äì2003. In winter the playing fields are used for hockey, rugby and soccer pitches, and in summer for rounders and cricket pitches. Badminton, basketball and tennis are also played. Throughout the year there are regular inter-school and inter-House matches in all the main sports. The Corps also has an indoor rifle range on the campus. =Harris House, Hardraw= The school, through the J.G. Bird Trust, owned a former school and attached headmaster's house in the village of Hardraw, near Hawes, Wensleydale. School parties frequented this listed building, known as Harris House, to take part in outdoor pursuits. Built in 1875, it closed as a school in the 1960s and was bought by WHGS, which at the time owned several centres similar to but smaller than this. The centre was known as Hulme House until 1993, when W. C. Harris, an Old Hulmeian, left ¬£50,000 in his will for the renovation of the property. The house was then renamed after its principal benefactor. Harris House has now been sold. School life =House system= The House system had operated for more than 100 years until recent changes that reduced their number from six to four. The House Masters are all senior staff. Heads of House and House Prefects are elected annually. House artefacts, namely shields, banners and portraits, can be seen at the school in the New Hall. Origins of Houses The Houses in the old system were named after influential Mancunians: * Byrom - John Byrom, Poet * Dalton - John Dalton, Physicist * Fraser - James Fraser, reforming Anglican Bishop of Manchester * Gaskell - Elizabeth Gaskell, Author * Heywood - Oliver Heywood, Banker and philanthropist * Whitworth- Sir Joseph Whitworth, Engineer New-system houses are named after influential Hulmeians/benefactors: * Bonnick - WHGS Teacher, 1940s-1990s * Hulme - William Hulme, founder * Jones - Samuel Jones, Old Hulmeian, donor of first of the School's shields, for the form football competition. * Roberts - William Roberts, benefactor. Resident of Whalley Range who donated ¬£2000 in 1899, which was used to extend the School's grounds. =Combined Cadet Force= Towards the end of their second year (Year 8), the dwindling majority of pupils will join the voluntary CCF (the \\"Corps\\"). Uniform is issued and cadets accompany the Contingent on a Field Day in June and, if they wish, Summer Camp, where they take part in a wide variety of activities. They train once a week at School, following syllabuses which lead to promotion and qualifications. Cadets join either the Army (Duke of Lancaster's Regiment) or the RAF Section, which is currently non-operational, both of which are officered by teachers, whereafter a minimum of five terms' service is expected. They may then choose to continue as NCOs in the Sixth Form, during which time they undergo more advanced training and assist in instructing the younger cadets. The Corps meets weekly and takes part in a Field Day each term. In addition to Summer Camps, there are two camps at Easter, one on an RAF Station, the other adventurous training in North Wales. =Music= A concert band/orchestra exists and plays in several concerts each year along with the choir, jazz band and samba band. =Sports= The first XI cricket pitch Weekly fixtures are played against other local schools and also more prestigious clubs; for example, the cricket 1st XI have an annual fixture vs. the MCC.

It was written in 1785 and first printed anonymously in an eight-page pamphlet in 1789.Daiches, David (1952). Robert Burns. London: G. Bells It is considered the greatest of all Burns' satirical poems, one of the finest satires by any poet, and a withering attack on religious hypocrisy. It is written in the Scots language, but is accessible to most modern English readers. Analysis The poem is an attack on the bigotry and hypocrisy of some members of the Kirk, or Church of Scotland, as told by the (fictional) self-justifying prayer of a (real) kirk elder, Willie Fisher. In his prayer, Holy Willie piously asks God's forgiveness for his own transgressions and moments later demanding that God condemn his enemies who commit the same sins to eternal hellfire. Burns used Holy Willie to argue that the Calvinist theology of the Kirk encouraged hypocrisy. Burns believed that John Calvin's doctrine of predestination, whether to salvation or damnation, made people morally reckless. This was because their salvation was believed to rest, not on their own actions but on being assigned to the \\"elect\\" by an inscrutable God. He observed that belief in predestination had the additional tendency to make people insufferably self-righteous. It is this last tendency in particular, and the more general theological and moral sterility embodied in much of the teachings of the Kirk, that he lampoons very effectively in this work. Holy Willie's self- righteousness and judgmentalism are skillfully alternated with tales of his own womanising, boozing, and other moral transgressions. The characters are drawn from real life, with no names being changed. The real Holy Willie Satirical depiction of a Scottish kirk at the time of Burns. A painting by David Allan. Willie Fisher was an elder of the kirk in Mauchline. Fisher conceived a dislike for Gavin Hamilton, a local lawyer, landlord and the collector of stent, administering the collection of poor relief within the parish, who also happened to be a close friend of Burns'. Hamilton was suspected of financial impropriety when inconsistencies in the accounts were discovered. It may be (this was Hamilton's defence) that the deficit was the result of Hamilton's kindly acts in forgiving the debts of those who were unable to pay their tithes to the kirk. Fisher spied on Hamilton and added the charges of: *Travelling on the Christian Sabbath. *Not reading the Bible on a Sunday. *Digging his garden on the Sabbath (hence the poem's reference to \\"kail and potatoes\\") Fisher's complaint against Hamilton was heard and adjudicated by the Presbytery of Ayr, as is stated in Burn's own commentary on the poem. (In the Presbyterian polity of the Church of Scotland, a presbytery is a regional council of ministers and elders. It may function as a court when complaints against members, or more likely, ministers are brought to it.) Hamilton won the case. Hence, Holy Willie complains bitterly to God not only against Hamilton himself but also against the Presbytery: :\\"Lord, hear my earnest cry and pray'r, :Against that Presbyt'ry o' Ayr!\\" Willie Fisher never recovered from the ignominy of this public defeat, and, legend has it, was found dead in a ditch with a bottle of whisky.

Based on the play Wild Waves by William Ford Manley, the film is about a radio-singer who becomes a popular hit with audiences, but takes a casual approach to his career. A casual affair leads to his dismissal, but his career is saved by the station manager who buys the station and gives him his job back. The film co- stars George Burns and Gracie Allen in supporting roles. The Big Broadcast was produced by Paramount Pictures and was the first in a series of four Big Broadcast movies. Plot Radio-singer Bing Crosby is not very serious about his career. His chronic tardiness and his affair with the notorious Mona Lowe (Sharon Lynn) has become an issue at station WADX. After Mona cheats on him, the despondent singer meets Texas oil man Leslie McWhinney (Stuart Erwin), who has also been wronged by a woman. Soon after, Anita Rogers (Leila Hyams), the former fianc√©e of McWhinney, falls in love with Crosby. Meanwhile, station manager George Burns is plagued by the addled conversation of his stenographer, Gracie Allen and eventually loses the radio station. McWhinney buys the station in order to help out Crosby and Anita, whom he still loves. McWhinney comes up with the idea of putting on a \\"big broadcast\\" of stars to pull the station out of debt. Mona returns on the scene and threatens the budding romance between Crosby and Anita, as well as the station's upcoming big broadcast. McWhinney tries to find a phonograph record to replace the absent Crosby, and ends up impersonating Crosby on the air. The singer returns and takes the microphone in mid-song. Crosby, who actually has been feigning irresponsibility to bring McWhinney and Anita together, succeeds both in reuniting the former lovers and in taming Mona.Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

The ‚ÄúBlue of the Night‚Äù boy is a picture personality, as he demonstrated in his two-reelers. He has a camera face and a camera presence. Always at ease, he troupes like a veteran.\\" The Hollywood Citizen News had more to say: \\".... Bing Crosby croons several attractive songs which seem destined to enjoy wide popularity. For that matter, he needn‚Äôt be ashamed of his acting either. Burns and Allen have several good comedy sequences, and Cab Calloway and his orchestra are excellent in one sequence. All the radio stars are heard much as you hear them on the air. The novelty of seeing them may be an attraction. But Tuttle has not relied upon the drawing power of that novelty. He has injected little touches of fantasy, hints of satire, moments of slapstick comedy and a general impression of jolly good humor. He tells you frankly that this picture is not to be taken seriously and I think that most audiences will believe him and thereby enjoy it.\\" References External links  * 1932 films 1932 musical comedy films American black-and-white films Paramount Pictures films American films English-language films Films directed by Frank Tuttle American musical comedy films Films made before the MPAA Production Code 1932 comedy films ","title":"The Big Broadcast"},{"id":"3824689","text":"Bellow's Regiment of Militia also known as the 16th New Hampshire Militia Regiment was called up at Walpole, New Hampshire, on September 21, 1777, as reinforcements for the Continental Army during the Saratoga Campaign.

Plot Radio station W.H.Y. owner Spud Miller (Jack Oakie), also functions as the station's only announcer while his comic partner Smiley Goodwin (Henry Wadsworth) serves as the house singer, Lochinvar, The Great Lover, \\"the idol of millions of women.\\" Both Spud and Smiley play the role of Lochinvar. Facing the prospect of bankruptcy, Spud welcomes the suggestions of George Burns and Gracie Allen, who attempt to sell an invention, The Radio Eye, invented by Gracie Allen's uncle, a television device which can pick up and transmit any signal, any time, anywhere. Burns and Allen ask Miller for an advance of $5,000 for the invention. Spud decides to enter an international broadcast competition with a prize of $250,000. Ysobel listens to the Lochinvar radio show and believes that he has sent her a letter. She finds out that he sends letters to listeners of the show. Outraged, she goes to the radio station to shoot Lochinvar. Spud and Smiley are able to win her over after her gun fails to shoot. They attempt to convince her to invest $5,000 in The Radio Eye invention which would allow them to win the competition. She takes Spud and Smiley to her Caribbean island, Clementi. She will decide to marry one of them before midnight. Gordoni (C. Henry Gordon), however, plans to murder them. Spud and Smiley are able to notify George Burns and Gracie Allen in New York and inform them that they are in grave danger. Burns and Allen then depart for the island on a boat. Gracie sets a fire on the boat. A Coast Guard cutter takes them on board and heads for the island. Gordoni has Drowzo put in the drinks to put Ysobel to sleep. Spud and Smiley turn on The Radio Eye to listen to the Vienna Boys Choir and the Ray Noble Orchestra from New York to distract Gordoni and his men. Spud and Smiley are able to escape on coaches with teams of horses. After a chase, during which Spud is separated from his horses in a bifurcation in the road, they reach the pier where the Coast Guard and Burns and Allen meet them. Gordoni jumps into the sea. Spud wins the international broadcast competition. Spud tells Ysobel that he may marry her after a period of observation. She tells him: \\"Let this be the start of a beautiful friendship.\\" Production notes Paramount's Big Broadcast series began in 1932 and continued in late 1935 with The Big Broadcast of 1936 (1935), which was released on September 20, 1935. The movie was filmed at the Kaufman Astoria Studios on 3412 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, in New York City. Bing Crosby's cameo, however, was filmed in Hollywood in April 1935. The movie is a precursor for the later Bob Hope and Bing Crosby \\"Road\\" pictures, with Spud and Smiley finding themselves on an island ruled by Countess Ysobel de Nargila (Lyda Roberti).

The stories revolved around the inhabitants of the fictitious land of 'Bluffoonia' and their ongoing struggle against the evil tyrant 'Clandestino' and his plans to destroy the forest in which they live. The series was based on an idea by Gene Deitch, who also wrote the lyrics. Michael Jupp, who also created The Dreamstone and Bimble's Bucket, was art director for the series and created the characters. The show's opening strapline is: Bluffoonia once was a beautiful country before the crazed maniac Clandestino took over. Clandestino turned that beautiful place into this. Why? Because Clandestino is afraid the Bluffers will get his secret ‚Äî the secret of getting it all! Characters =Heroes= * Zok (short for Zocrates), a wise old owl wearing a toga and a laurel wreath. Zok is a fatherly figure and advisor to the Bluffers (i.e., the animal denizens of the last remaining forest in Bluffoonia), and the keeper of the encyclopedic Book of All Knowledge. His name is a take-off of Socrates (hence his Roman Emperor appearance). * Zip, a fast-running blue squirrel with a love of adventure; he's led a number of raids into Clandestino's castle. When Zip is not leading a raid on the castle he is often found in some activity involving nuts. * Blossom, a pink mouse with a head of red hair. She has romantic feelings for Zip but he is reluctant to return them. * Honey Boy, a simple-minded brown bear with a strong passion for anything to do with honey, and whose pet bees are always flying around his head. * Sharpy, a red, bipedal fox who likes to outwit others for his own gain. He feels that lying, cheating, and stealing are what \\"real foxes\\" do, although he tends not to do these very successfully. * Regal Eagle, an eagle (although he looks more like a buzzard) who talks and thinks like a soldier. This character is the least featured of the Bluffers and is often only called upon to perform a small task in any plans the animals may have. * Gin-Seng, a goose with an Oriental appearance about her who specializes in brewing herbal remedies. She is named after the plant ginseng. * Prickly Pine, a hyperactive, red-quilled porcupine who is always ready for action and combat. He is able to project his quills with pinpoint accuracy, although this inexhaustible supply of quills often end up in the rump of Sharpy or some other unsuspecting Bluffer. * Psycho, a shy, reclusive snake with limited psychic powers; e.g., he was once used as a metal detector. When speaking he adds an audible \\"P\\" to words that contain an \\"S\\" sound; \\"p'sad,\\" \\"p'certainly,\\" et cetera. =Villains= * Clandestino, a bloated, self-adoring, hunchbacked human; he's the self-appointed totalitarian ruler of Bluffoonia. He lives in a fortress- like castle, the dungeon of which contains his precious \\"Secret of Getting It All\\" which is the source of his power. * Sillycone, Clandestino's robot butler; he is smarter than his master and seems to possess no malice, but he serves Clandestino faithfully. His name is based upon Silicon (the element most transistors and integrated circuits are made out of) and Silly. =Other characters= * Glum, Clandestino's watchdog; his sympathies lie with the Bluffers, but he doesn't dare to openly rebel against his master because he doesn't want to lose his home in the castle. * Song and Dance, two rabbits ‚Äî one tall and thin, one short and fat ‚Äî who are often wearing sunglasses. They are sometimes seen conducting the musical segments, but are not integral to the stories. =Episode list= 01\\\\. Memory Forever 02\\\\. The Present of Time 03\\\\.

Most of the stories are centered on Clandestino doing or plotting something that will either destroy Bluffoonia's last forest or otherwise disrupt the Bluffers' lives, and the Bluffers' attempts to thwart him. Some of the stories are centered on the Bluffers' plans to steal Clandestino's \\"Secret of Getting It All\\" so they can use it to remove him from power. This secret, which plays a major part in most episodes, is never successfully stolen or even revealed throughout the series. The closest of it seen is the door to the secret, locked and vaulted with chains, a skull and stylish lights around its frame. Only Clandestino is allowed to see it, and if anyone tries and dares, even by his servants, are to be killed. That's why he always carries to keys to the locks of the door. In the final episode of the entire series, whilst digging his courtyard with his machines for minerals, ended up disrupting the moat, thus causing the entire castle to be flooded, and the lower parts sunk, taking the secret with it, despite his futile attempts of rescuing it. Each episode contains two musical numbers. Availability In the late 1980s, the series was released on VHS videocassettes in the United States (by Celebrity Home Entertainment's \\"Just For Kids label) and most European countries, each containing one or more episodes. There was also a videocassette of collected musical numbers from the series. As of this writing, all of these are out of print.

As a founder of the cosmetics giant Max Factor & Company, he largely developed the modern cosmetics industry in the United States and popularised the term \\"make-up\\" in noun form based on the verb. He is also known for doing makeovers for starlets and giving them their signature looks; his most iconic works include Jean Harlow's platinum hair, Clara Bow's bob, Lucille Ball's false lashes and red curls, and Joan Crawford's \\"Hunter's Bow\\", or overdrawn lips. Early life Factor, of Polish-Jewish descent, was born in Zdu≈Ñska Wola, Congress Poland, to Abraham Faktorowicz (1850/52 before 1938) and Cecylia Wroc≈Çawska.Leszczy≈Ñska Joanna, Max Factor. Czarodziej gwiazd, [w:] \\"Nasza Historia\\" [wyd. ≈Ç√≥dzkie], stycze≈Ñ 2014, s. 8‚Äì11. His father, a hard- working grocer, rabbi, or textile mill worker (depending upon the source), could not afford a formal education for his four children. By the age of eight years, Factor was working as an assistant to a dentist and pharmacist.Basten, page 1. At the age of nine, he was apprenticed to a wig maker and cosmetician in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. That experience enabled him to gain a position at Anton's of Berlin, a leading hairstylist and cosmetics creator. By the age of fourteen, he was working at Korpo, a Moscow wig maker and cosmetician to the Imperial Russian Grand Opera. He spent the years from age eighteen to twenty-two undertaking his compulsory military service in the Imperial Russian Army, where he served in the Hospital Corps. Upon his discharge, he opened his own shop in the town of Ryazan, selling hand-made rouges, creams, fragrances, and wigs. He became well known when a traveling theatrical troupe wore Factor's cosmetics to perform for Russian nobility. The Russian nobility appointed Factor the official cosmetics expert for the royal family and the Imperial Russian Grand Opera, an honor which led to him being closely monitored. He married Esther Rosa (whom he called Lizzie) and by early 1904 they had produced three children, Freda, Cecilia and Davis.Basten, page 6. By 1904, concerned about the increasing anti-Jewish persecution developing in Congress Poland, he and his wife decided to follow his brother Nathan and uncle Fischel to America. Worried that he would not be released from his royal service, he arranged with the assistance of a friend to take a rest cure at Karlovy Vary. After meeting up with his family they traveled in the steerage class on board the S.S. Moltke III and were processed at Ellis Island on February 25, 1904; he had $400 in his possession.Basten, page 10. They settled in St. Louis, Missouri. Life in the United States He sold his rouges and creams at the 1904 World's Fair, operating under the newly re-spelled name Max Factor. His partner in the venture stole all of his stock and the profits. With assistance from his brother and uncle, Factor recovered and opened a barber's shop. In August 1904, Max and his wife had their fourth child, Francis \\"Frank\\" Factor. However, on March 17, 1906, his wife collapsed and died from a brain hemorrhage. Anxious to provide a mother for his four children, he married Huma \\"Helen\\" Sradkowska on 15 August 1906.Basten, page 18 Despite the birth of Louis on August 29, 1907, the marriage was short-lived and ended in a prolonged court battle, as result of which Factor obtained custody of all of his children. Creation of an empire On January 21, 1908, Factor married Jennie Cook (March 1, 1886 ‚Äì December 3, 1949), a neighbor. Later that year Factor moved his family to Los Angeles, California, seeing an opportunity to provide made-to-order wigs and theatrical make-up to the growing film industry. Initially he established a shop on South Central Avenue, advertising the business as \\"Max Factor's Antiseptic Hair Store\\". Founding Max Factor & Company in 1909, he soon became the West Coast distributor of Leichner and Minor, two leading theatrical make-up manufacturers. Greasepaint in stick form, although the accepted make-up for use on the stage, could not be applied thinly enough, nor were the colors appropriate, to work satisfactorily on the screen during the early years of movie-making. Factor began experimenting with various compounds in an effort to develop a suitable make-up for the new film medium. By 1914 he had perfected the first cosmetic specifically created for motion picture use‚Äîa thinner greasepaint in cream form, packaged in a jar, and created in 12 precisely-graduated shades. Unlike theatrical cosmetics, it would not crack or cake. With this major achievement to his credit, Max Factor became the authority on cosmetics for film making. Soon, movie stars were eager to sample the \\"flexible greasepaint\\", while movie producers sought Factor's human hair wigs. He allowed the wigs to be rented to the producers of old Westerns, on the condition that his sons were given parts. The boys would watch the expensive wigs. Factor marketed a range of cosmetics to the public during the 1920s, insisting that every girl could look like a movie star by using Max Factor cosmetics. In the early years of the business Factor personally applied his products to actors and actresses. He developed a reputation for being able to customize makeup to present actors and actresses in the best possible light on screen. Among his most notable clients were Ben Turpin, Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, Pola Negri, Jean Harlow, Claudette Colbert, Bette Davis, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, and Judy Garland. As a result, virtually all of the major movie actresses were regular customers of the Max Factor beauty salon, located near Hollywood Boulevard. Max Factor's name appeared on many movie credits, and Factor appeared in some cameos. Factor became a United States citizen in 1916. In 1920 Max Factor gave in to Frank Factor's suggestion and officially began referring to his products as \\"make-up\\". Until then, the term \\"cosmetics\\" had been used because \\"make-up\\" was considered to be used only by people in the theatre or of dubious reputation, not something to be used in polite society. Death In 1938 Factor was traveling in Europe on business with his son Davis when during a stopover in Paris he received a note demanding money in exchange for his life. An attempt was made by the police using a decoy to capture the extortionist but no one turned up at the agreed drop-off point to collect the money. Factor was so shaken by the threat that he returned at the behest of a local doctor to America, where upon arrival he took to his bed. Factor died on August 30, 1938, at the age of 60 in Beverly Hills, California. He was originally interred in the Beth Olem mausoleum at the Hollywood Cemetery in Los Angeles. His remains were moved many years later to Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.Basten, page 122 Honors and tributes The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Max Factor with an honorary Academy Award in 1929 for his contributions to the film industry. Additionally, Max Factor is honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (at 6922 Hollywood Boulevard). Max Factor is mentioned in the classic song, \\"Hooray For Hollywood.\\" In a reference to his creation of Clara Bow's heart- shaped lips, the song states, \\"To be an actor / See Mr. Factor / He'll make your pucker look good!\\" Family Maxime Factor in the Netherlands (September 12, 1963) Max Factor had six children: * Freda Shore (January 22, 1898 June 18, 1988) * Cecilia Firestein (October 17, 1899 May 28, 1984) * Davis Factor (February 2, 1902 August 31, 1991) * Francis \\"Frank\\" Factor (later known as Max Factor Jr.; August 18, 1904 June 7, 1996) * Louis Factor (August 29, 1907 December 1975) * Sidney B.

MAG-16 was the first helicopter group established in the Marine Corps. Prior to its activation helicopter squadrons were considered special units and reported directly to the Air Wing commanding general with no intermediate command. Colonel Harold J. Mitchener was MAG-16's first commanding officer. Seven units made up the newly formed MAG: Headquarters Squadron(HQSQ) 16, Marine Airbase Squadron(MABS) 16, Marine Aircraft Maintenance Squadron(MAMS) 16, Marine Helicopter Transport Squadrons(HMR) 162, 163, 362, and 363. =Vietnam War= On the evening of 12‚Äì13 August helicopters from MAG-16 participated in the first night helicopter assault of the Vietnam War. They debarked 245 Marines and returned to Da Nang without incident. =1980s & 1990s= Through the years, many other helicopter squadrons have made MAG-16 their home. Units of MAG-16 have participated in Operation Desert Punch, Operation Seahorse Wind, Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm and many other missions, including Operation Iraqi Freedom. MAG-16 has provided support in Somalia to include rescue operations in many other locations. MAG-16 deploys its units aboard the fleet of the United States Navy to maintain a high state of awareness overseas and abroad. MAG-16 and its units have provided aircraft support and transportation for visiting U.S. dignitaries and celebrities from the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, Commandant of the Marine Corps and movie legend Audrey Hepburn. MAG-16 also provides aircraft and personnel for the MCAS Miramar Air Show. =Global War on Terror= From 11 September 2001 through to the present, elements of MAG-16 have actively participated in the Global War on Terror, beginning with HMM-163(REIN)'s role in establish FOB Rhino in Afghanistan as part of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which consisted of a core CH-46E HMM squadron, a CH-53E detachment from HMH-465, both part of MAG-16, as well as HMLA and VMA detachments. All flying squadrons of MAG-16 have participated in the GWOT in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations, but were almost always under the command of other headquarters elements. MAG-16's headquarters element was specifically deployed in support of the GWOT from January 2008 through January 2009, where they provided the primary command of Marine aviation support in Iraq's Al Anbar Province. By the end of this deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom the MAG had achieved a milestone 80,000 flight hours in support of Multi- National Forces West and adjacent commands. =Expeditionary transformation= MAG-16 continues to reshape its identity for the current expeditionary environment of the Marine Corps. The CH-46E Sea Knight is currently being replaced with the MV-22B Osprey to augment its heavy lift assault support assets. The MV-22B adds a long-range capability to the MAGTF that will extend its reach well beyond current assault support assets. MAG-16 will continue to refine its identity to \\"respond to today's crisis with today's force.\\" Notable former members *Raymond M. Clausen, Jr. - Medal of Honor recipient *Eugene R.

Kiffa is located at , some from the coast and at the western end of the Aoukar sand sea of southern Mauritania. Climate Kiffa has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh). The climate is Sahelian, with April to June as the hottest months and eighty-five percent of the low annual rainfall occurring from July to September. In the 1990s and 2000s Kiffa benefited from higher rainfall levels than elsewhere in the western Sahel.‚ÄòRainfall variability and vegetation dynamics in the Mauritanian Sahel‚Äô, Climate Research, December 2008, p.79.

Population, infrastructure and agriculture Kiffa was allowed to grow haphazardly and to sprawl during the later 20th century, and it has continued to do so. Near Kiffa is Kiffa Airport which has a tarmac runway of over 1,600 yards in length. But all practical travel to other parts of Mauritania is undertaken by taxi cars and trucks. About two thirds of the population are settled Berber pastoralists, who as late as the 1950s operated as sheep, goat and camel herding nomads.Pierre M. Munier, L'Assab, Centre IFAN, 1952. Political and social life is largely dictated by hereditary family allegiances, now expressed amid a complex wider tangle of religious, regionalist and nationalist affiliations. From 1948 the French colonists ran experimental palm-date plantations in the red soil around Kiffa, having had great success with date-growing elsewhere in Mauritania, but labor and water shortages caused these to fail by 1952.French West Africa, Stanford University Press, 1958 A small-scale reforestation program, intended to guard against sand dune encroachment, was tried to little effect in the late 1980s.Sand Encroachment Control in Mauritania, United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office, 1991.

The nation of Japan is also involved in health-related aid to Kiffa, having funded a major Study on Groundwater Development for Kiffa. In 2002 Japan followed up the report by undertaking the first of an ongoing series of $5m (US dollars) worth of projects that now supply basic drinking water and basic water sanitation.Open Aid Data, \\"Mauritania\\", accessed October 2015. The town's Berber nomadic heritage meant that Kiffa has continued to support an extensive livestock trade based on bush forage grazing, mixed with limited millet-based agrarian activity.K.

A large produce market at Kiffa continues to attract traders and buyers from the surrounding area, and this trade is being supported by ongoing road repair schemes in the region. For instance, the International Monetary Fund noted in a 2011 report that - with Chinese aid - Mauritania was \\"starting rehabilitation and extension works on the Kiffa- Tintane road\\", Tintane being a large town of 100,000 near the Mali border and about east of Kiffa.

Kiffa beads The south region of Kiffa was home to one of the most notable beadmaking centres in West Africa, famous for its now-antique Kiffa beads, made exclusively by women from secret recipes involving powdered glass. Raymond Maun documented most of the local bead making process in 1949, but was unable to discover the special \\"glass-cream recipe\\" still kept secret by local women.\\"Fabrication de perles de verre en Mauritanie\\", Notes Africaines, No. 44, 1949, pp. 116‚Äì118., and \\"Contribution a la prehistoire de la Mauritanie occidentale\\", Bulletin de l'Institut Francais d'Afrique Noire, Tome XII, No.4, Missions A.

Affolle mountains The Affolle mountains or Massif de l'Affolle near Kiffa covers a region of more than .U.S. Army Map Series 1301: Map of Kiffa and region, 1940. The mountains are populated in tiny agrarian settlements that are usually centred on a spring emerging from the foot of a high escarpment. The largest settlement is Tamchaket located at the northern-western edge and Tintane at the south-eastern edge. The nearest substantial town is Kiffa, on the plain about to the west of the mountains. The Affolle mountains are steep- sided massifs of dense Devonian sandstone, with relatively flat plateaus at their summits. The Affolle also has steppe and desert canyon bottoms, and several large wetland areas. The mountains have more rain than the surrounding plain. A few kilometres to the north, surrounded by the southern tip of the Aoukar sand sea, is an outlying island mountain plateau named Rkiss. French colonialists wrote a number of detailed accounts of the area at various points during the 20th century. The French naturalist Lieutenant P. Boery documented the outlying Rkiss 'mountain island' in the mid 1920s.Lieutenant P. Boery, Le Rkiss (Mauritanie): Essai de monographie locale, Bulletin du Comite d'Etudes Historiques et Scientifiques de l'Afrique Occidentale Francaise, Vol. 10, No. 3. A study of the area's hydrology was published in French in 1960.Etude hydrogeologique de l'Affolle, 1960. and the geology of the Affolle was fully surveyed and understood by the 1960s.J.M. Ayme et al, Stratigraphie du massif de l'Affole, 1962. Some unproductive modern mineral exploration was commissioned in the early 1980s, such as a survey of the copper in and south of the Affolle. Until the 1980s there were known to be small elephants (Loxodonta africana) surviving as relic populations in the Affolle valleys.Michael Evenari et at, Hot Deserts and Arid Shrublands, Volume 12, Part 2, p. 229 But a proposed national park for them failed to materialize and more recently the conservation literature has presumed that the elephant has become extinct throughout Mauritania.African Elephant Status Report 2002, International Union for Conservation of Nature. Relic populations of a Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus laurenti, 1768), once presumed extinct, were found in the late 1990s at four wetlands sites in the Affole. The scientific report on these animals found that local beliefs afforded them some protection, since the \\"Mauritanian villagers living near the wetlands believe that if the crocodiles are killed the water will disappear and bad luck befall the village\\".Wolfgang Bohme et al, \\"Rediscovery of relic populations of the Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus in south‚Äêeastern Mauritania, with observations on their natural history\\", Oryx, Vol. 35, Issue 3, 2001.

First Jersey Securities Fraud As a result of this penny stock scheme, Brennan became a target of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. First Jersey itself went bankrupt in 1987 and Brennan was found guilty of securities fraud in 1994. The US Government ordered him to pay $75 million to settle the fraud claims. Brennan declared bankruptcy in 1995 but committed another fraud when he did not declare all of his assets to the court. Brennan withheld from the bankruptcy court that he held $500,000 in casino chips that he had purchased (and later cashed out of after his bankruptcy) and $4 million in municipal bonds he kept in his basement. He then directed an associate to liquidate the bonds overseas and invest them in stocks, which netted him $16 million in ill-gotten gains. Money Laundering In 2001 Brennan was found guilty of money-laundering and bankruptcy fraud and sentenced to a prison term of nine years and two months. On appeal, in 2003 the sentence was upheld. Brennan served part of his sentence at the US Bureau of Prison's Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey.

His career as a journalist began in 1974 with The Indian Express and was the chief reporter with The Free Press Journal from 1984 to 1989. In 1971, he started Debonair, with friend Anthony Van Braband and later in 1990, he founded Bombay Dost, India's first gay magazine. He was a representative at the International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam and served as chairman of the Second International Congress on AIDS. Although he retired from journalism in 1990, he has worked at providing a formal platform for homosexuals to become actively involved in public life and institutions through media, advocacy, co- operation and community-building. Row Kavi was the first person to openly talk about homosexuality and gay rights in India. His first coming out interview appeared in Savvy magazine in 1986. His mother, Shobha Row Kavi, also gave an interview to the same magazine; it was the first time that a mother spoke about her son's homosexuality to the Indian media. Activism At the present, he is founder-chairperson of the Humsafar Trust, an LGBT rights and health services NGO, which also agitates for the legal emancipation of homosexuality in India. The trust's work comprises community work, outreach into the gay and MSM groups, advocacy on gender and sexuality issues concerning sexual minorities and research into sexuality and gender issues. Besides running several intervention programmes (funded by national and international organisations and private donors) for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections in Mumbai and Goa, Row Kavi and the trust have been lobbying with policy making bodies as well as supporting similar upcoming groups across the country. In 1998, Row Kavi received a fellowship to design model questionnaires in the MSM sector at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS), University of California, San Francisco. Row Kavi has been a participant in various international and national fora, including the ICAAPs and the International HIV/AIDS Conferences, where he has made at least five oral presentations. As head of Humsafar, he has also organised the first 'Looking into the Next Millennium' conference of 32 MSM NGOs in Mumbai in May 2001 and co-organized the first ILGA-Asia conference in Mumbai in October 2002. Row Kavi has been a regular contributor to newspapers, magazines and journals around the world, on homosexuality, gay rights and issues around HIV/AIDS.

Row Kavi has been listed among India's Seven Most Influential Gay & Lesbian individuals by Pink Pages magazine.http://pink-pages.co.in/profiles/indias- most-influential-gays-and-lesbians-ashok-row-kavi/ In September 2017 India Times listed Kavi as one of the 11 Human Rights Activists Whose Life Mission Is To Provide Others With A Dignified Life  Controversy  In 1995 on the Nikki Tonight show hosted by Nikki Bedi, Row Kavi related a story about how he had, in his youth, had a letter published in a magazine in which he described Mahatma Gandhi as a \\"bastard bania\\". The STAR TV show was widely criticised and considered irresponsible for broadcasting the story and it resulted in the cancellation of the show. Nikki Bedi and Row Kavi would soon make a public apology as well.\\"Gandhi Meets Primetime: Globalization and Nationalism in Indian Television\\", By Shanti Kumar, P. 156  References   External links  * Interview at Gay Today Magazine * Humsafar * Row Kavi on the Da Vinci Code 1947 births Living people Journalists from Maharashtra Indian activist journalists Gay writers LGBT monks LGBT writers from India LGBT Hindus LGBT rights activists from India Writers from Mumbai LGBT people from India ","title":"Ashok Row Kavi"},{"id":"3824885","text":"Kifa or KIFA may refer to: * Kiffa, city and department in Mauritania * Killed in flight accident * King Island Football Association, Tasmania, Australia * Kiribati Islands Football Association ","title":"Kifa"},{"id":"3824910","text":"Bunshinsaba () is a 2004 South Korean horror film directed by Ahn Byeong-ki. In 2004, it screened at the 8th annual Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival. The film had its American premiere at the 2005 New York Korean Film Festival, and was shown later that year at the 5th annual Screamfest Horror Film Festival. In 2012 Ahn Byeong-ki directed a Chinese film also titled Bunshinsaba but with an unrelated plot. Plot Lee Yoo-jin is a transfer student from Seoul, and along with two of her friends, she is constantly being bullied by a group of classmates. One night, Yoo-jin and her friends decide to place a curse on their enemies by creating a Ouija board on which they write the names of the female bullies. Using the Bunshinsaba curse, her friend warns the others not to open their eyes until the spell is finished. The calling takes effect, and Yoo-jin, somewhat curious, opens her eyes. To her shock and horror, she sees an image of a pale-like dead girl with long hair beside her. The next morning when Yoo-jin enters the classroom, she discovers the corpse of one of the bullies on top of the desk, with a burned face. Meanwhile, the school hires a volunteer teacher, Lee Eun-ju, as the new art instructor. She starts to call the roll in her class and stumbles on seat number 29 as she mentions the name of a deceased girl, Kim In-sook. The students are terrified when they hear the name, and rush out of the classroom when they see her talking to thin air. The only one left is Yoo-jin, who tells Eun-ju that Kim In-sook doesn't exist. Eun-ju takes another look at the seat and realizes that there's no name at seat number 29. Suddenly, Yoo-jin sees a figure on Eun-ju's back. Investigations soon rise as the other three bullies die in the same manner. Finally, Yoo-jin realizes that the spirit of Kim In-sook is possessing her. She was the one who killed all of those bullies, even though she doesn't remember doing it. Eun-ju also senses a terrible force and unearthly presence surrounding Yoo-jin. Mr. Han, Yoo-jin's class adviser, decides to help out by consulting his friend on what is causing her to act strangely. Through hypnotism, they are able to see a vision of the past showing how Kim In-sook and her mother Chun-hee were brutally killed by the villagers, and before dying, they placed a curse that for generations to come, whoever left the village would die. As Chun-hee finally takes possession of Eun-ju's body, she exacts punishment on the people who wronged them, slaying the school's principal but sparing Mr. Han's life. Not long after, Eun-ju gives birth to a girl and within that girl's body is the spirit of Kim In-sook.

Leblanc was born in Bouctouche, New Brunswick. He studied at the Universit√© de Moncton and lived in Moncton, where he died in 2005. He also spent a good part of his life in New York City, which he loved. Deeply Acadian and North American, G√©rald Leblanc tirelessly sought the roots of his Acadian identity. The quality and abundance of his poetic work guarantee him a place amongst the most important authors of modern Acadian poetry. He was also the author, along with Claude Beausoleil, of an anthology of Acadian poetry. He was the lyricist for the Acadian musical group 1755 and wrote many of the group's classic songs (\\"Le monde a bien chang√©\\", \\"Boire ma bouteille\\", Rue Dufferin\\", \\"Kouchibouguac\\"). He was an unabashed champion of \\"chiac\\", which is the slang spoken mainly in south eastern New Brunswick and mixes English and French words and syntax. As a poet and speaker, he was invited to various countries: Canada (Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, Halifax,etc.), the United States (New York and New Orleans), France (Paris, La Rochelle, Caen, Grenoble, Lyon, and Poitiers), Belgium (Brussels, Namur, Li√®ge), the Republic of Congo (Kinshasa), Mexico (Mexico City), the Czech Republic (Prague), Slovakia (Bratislava), and Switzerland (Del√©mont).

This is often done (and sometimes required by law) at filling stations, to reduce noxious and potentially explosive fumes and pollution. The negative pressure created in the (underground) storage tank by fuel being drawn, combined with the pressure in the car's fuel tank caused by the inflow, is usually used to pull in the vapors. They are drawn in through holes in the side of the nozzle and travel along a return path through another hose. In Australia, vapor recovery has become mandatory in major urban areas. There are two categories - VR1 and VR2. VR1 must be installed at fuel stations that pump less than 500,000 litres annually, VR2 must be installed for larger amounts, or as designated by various EPA bodies. Other industries Vapor recovery is also used in the chemical process industry to remove and recover vapors from storage tanks. The vapors are usually either environmentally hazardous, or valuable. The process consists of a closed venting system from the storage tank ullage space to a vapor recovery unit which will recover the vapors for return to the process or destroy them, usually by oxidation. Vapor recovery units are also becoming commonly used in the oil and gas industry as a means of recovering natural gas vapor and making it a usable and profitable product. Vapor recovery towers are also used in the oil and gas industry to provide flash gas recovery at near atmospheric pressure without the chance of oxygen ingress at the top of the storage tanks. The ability to create the vapor flash inside the tower often reduces storage tank emissions to less than six tons per year, exempting the tank battery from Quad O reporting requirements.

He has provided some interesting insights into his father's life and circle of friends. Greville was a notable ear, nose and throat doctor. In later life Greville became involved in the Peasant Art movement in Haslemere.  Biography  Greville is famous for having read Alice in Wonderland when \\"Uncle Dodgson\\" ‚Äì Reverend Charles Dodgson, otherwise known as Lewis Carroll ‚Äì was wondering whether to publish it. Louisa Powell MacDonald read the book to her children to gauge its worth if published, and Greville remembers his \\"braggart avowal that I wished there were 60,000 volumes of it\\".MacDonald, G. (1932), Reminiscences of a Specialist, London, George Allen and Unwin. Carroll was uncertain of its potential for publication until he tried the manuscript with the MacDonald children and learned of the enthusiastic reception. Boy with a Dolphin Alex Munro used Greville as a model for his 1865 sculpture in Hyde Park of a boy with a dolphin. Greville attributes his understanding of Latin to Octavia Hill (who became a co-founder of the National Trust in 1895, along with Haslemere's Sir Robert Hunter) who joined the family on holiday in 1867 at Bude, and became a lifelong friend of Greville. Greville MacDonald Greville went to King's College School and then went to train at Kings College Hospital. He briefly served as an assistant to Joseph Lister where his main responsibilities were to clean and sterilize surgical instruments. In 1885 MacDonald became Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy at King's College.Greville MacDonald Papers, Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin. Despite suffering from partial deafness which degenerated with age, Greville became an ear, nose and throat doctor of some distinction, becoming President of the British Medical Association's nose division. He resided at 85 Harley Street and he retired from medical practice in 1904. In 1919 he moved to Wildwood, Weydown Road, Haslemere. Greville's autobiography describes him as a \\"consulting physician to Kings College Hospital\\" and \\"Fellow and Emeritus Professor, King's College, London\\". Greville married his wife Elizabeth Phoebe Winn in 1887, they had no children, but from a dedication in one of his books, it would appear that he adopted a girl, \\"Mollie Gamble\\". Greville helped keep his father's memory alive by arranging the publication of new editions of his works, and by writing the painstakingly-researched biography George MacDonald and His Wife (1924). Greville wrote books on widely varied subjects, including a biography of his father and mother George MacDonald and His Wife, complex works such as The Sanity of William Blake and The Religious Sense in its Scientific Aspect, and fairy tales such as Count Billy and The Magic Crook, or The Stolen Baby. In 1900 Greville's parents moved to St George's Wood, Grayswood Road, Haslemere, into a house that he had had built for them, designed by his architect brother, Robert Falconer MacDonald, where his frail father spent his final few years. Those Greville described as his \\"best friends\\" ‚Äì Joseph King (MP), Maude Egerton King, Godfrey Blount, and Ethel Blount ‚Äì lived in Haslemere, too, and he had visited and stayed with them often. Greville and Joseph King were cousins. In 1913 Greville's wife \\"lost a leg\\" and that seems to be part of the reason behind his move to the country. Greville described his involvement in the Peasant Arts movement thus: \\"Happy that I might possibly help them, I soon assigned my scanty leisure, along with some too easily earned money, to the support of their Society.\\" Greville negotiated the purchase of the Museum of Peasant Arts from Reverend Gerald Davies in 1908, \\"at a price well below its value, but on the condition that it should never be displayed in any City Museum, where, he thought, its beauties might be swamped, and its materials damaged by smoke. Realizing the national worth of the collection I put it, by Trust Deed, in the hands of the Founders of the Peasant Arts Guild for the public benefit, thus protecting it against any possible mishap to the Guild.\\" Greville describes himself as launching The Vineyard Magazine in 1910.Swanton, E. W. (1947) A Country Museum, Haslemere Educational Museum. It was edited by his friend Maude Egerton King.

It is named for the five flags that have flown over Dubuque; the Fleur de Lis of France (1673‚Äì1763), the Royal Flag of Spain (1763‚Äì1803), the Union Jack of Great Britain (1780, during a brief interruption of Spanish rule), the French Republic Flag of Napoleon (1803) & America's Stars and Stripes (1803‚ÄìPresent). History The site's first theater was the Athenaeum Theater, built in 1840, which became the City Hotel (also a theater) in 1846 and later the Peosta House. with A second theatre was originally built in 1864 or 1877, but then was destroyed by fire in 1910. It had been purchased then renovated during 1909-1910 by local prominent businessman Harker Brentnal Spensley, Sr. and his partner, C. H. Eighmey. The current Great Five Flags Theater was constructed as the Majestic Theater in 1910. The rebuilt theater was designed by George L. Rapp, who eventually became one of the nation's premier theater architects. It was converted to a movie house in 1920 and renamed 'Spensley Theater' in 1929. Constructed in a Renaissance Revival style with French influences, it was later renamed the RKO Orpheum and used to show movies. Eventually, it fell into disrepair and was slated for demolition during urban renewal in 1969. A committee made up of concerned citizens began a fund drive to save the theater, which was incorporated in the Five Flags Center project in 1972. Restoration was begun in 1975, and the theater was reopened in 1976 as the Five Flags Theater. It is currently the home of the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra, high school musicals, and occasional concerts and ballet productions. Arena Five Flags Arena was conceived as part of a project to rehabilitate the Five Flags Theater. Construction began in 1976, and the facility opened in 1979. The first event was a concert by Bob Hope. The arena can seat up to 5,200 for basketball, although in its former primary use, ice hockey, actual seating capacity is only about 2,500. It features one side of permanent seating; the other three sides are bleachers, some for Loras College basketball, and most of Dubuque's major concerts. High school graduation ceremonies for Hempstead High School and Senior High School have been held at the center. The Five Flags Center was formerly the main convention center in Dubuque, but construction of the Grand River Event Center in 2003, moved many events away from Five Flags. It was also the former home of the Dubuque Fighting Saints (1980-2001) of the United States Hockey League from 1980‚Äì2001 and the home of the Dubuque Thunderbirds hockey team of the Central States Hockey League from 2001‚Äì2010. Dubuque opened a new Ice Arena, the Mystique Ice Center, which opened in Fall of 2010, and now hosts the expansion Dubuque Fighting Saints. SMG took over operations of the arena in 2004, which were formerly handled by the City of Dubuque. In 2005, the arena was closed during the summer for concession, entrance, and concourse renovation.

The background of the film is set in a high school in South Korea, 1978. The original Korean title literally means \\"cruel history of Maljuk street\\" and one of the filming locations was the present neighborhood of Yangjae-dong, Seocho District in Seoul.  Synopsis  Hyun-soo (Kwon Sang- woo), transfers to a school that is notorious for its poor outcomes and brutality. He joins a bottom-rank class and experiences violence by delinquents led by Jong-hoon (Lee Jong-hyuk), a stereotypical Korean bully. The teachers are depicted as authoritarian and brutal (as was common up into the 1970s). On the bus, Hyun-soo sees and falls in love with Eun-joo (Han Ga- in). When schoolboys start teasing her, Hyun-soo takes the opportunity to gain her respect, even though it starts a riot. After the two are chased and caught in their hiding place, one of Hyun-soo's friends Kim Woo-sik (Lee Jung-jin), steps in and knocks out the attackers. A love triangle is formed between Hyun- soo, Woo-sik, and Eun-joo. One day, Hyun-soo notices Woo-sik and Eun-joo arguing. Despite his only achievement being sharing an umbrella with her, he meets her on a rooftop that night and they bond with each other while Woo-sik jealously observes them in secret. One day Hyun-soo and Woo-sik get in a fight over Eun-joo and their friendship ends. Woo-sik then humiliates and beats up Ham Jye-bok or \\"Hamburger\\" (Park Hyo-jun) who sells pornography to other students. Woo-sik then loses an intense fight with Jong-hoon on the rooftop and leaves the school, presumably having dropped out. Hyun-soo concludes that Eun-joo has left him for Woo-sik. Hyun-soo's father is a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and an owner of a Tae Kwon Do gym; he treats his students kindly while treats his son poorly. When he discovers that Hyun-soo has been receiving poor grades, he beats him, refers to him as \\"surplus man\\" (a derogatory term for a person without a future), and kicks him out of his house permanently. No longer able to put up with the conduct of Jong-hoon, his gang, nor the brutality and violence of teachers, Hyun-soo trains himself in Jeet Kune Do, inspired by his childhood hero Bruce Lee. One day, on the same rooftop where Woo-sik lost his fight with Jong-hoon, Hyun-soo uses nunchaku and his new- found expertise in Jeet Kune Do to grievously injure Jong-hoon and his gang mates. When authorities blame Hyun-soo, he lashes out. Smashing windows and throwing his nunchucks, he curses Korea's entire education system for being so corrupt and encouraging brutality. Hyun-soo is expelled and sent to a public school. Jong-hoon's mother blames him for beating her son, forcing his father to apologize to her for his son's actions. Hyun-soo apologizes to his father about the incident and they eventually reconcile. His father tells him that he can always get a GED and asks if Bruce Lee went to college, knowing full well that he didn't and realizing that a good man isn't defined by a college education. By chance, he runs into Eun-joo. Hyun-soo later attends a movie with Ham Jye-bok and both goof off with mock martial arts over Bruce Lee vs Jackie Chan.

It means a computer or network has no network interfaces connected to other networks, with a physical or conceptual air gap, analogous to the air gap used in plumbing to maintain water quality.  Use in classified settings  An \\"air-gapped\\" computer or network is one that has no network interfaces, either wired or wireless, connected to outside networks. Many computers, even when they are not plugged into a wired network, have a wireless network interface controller (WiFi) and are connected to nearby wireless networks to access the Internet and update software. This represents a security vulnerability, so air-gapped computers either have their wireless interface controller permanently disabled or physically removed. To move data between the outside world and the air-gapped system, it is necessary to write data to a physical medium such as a thumbdrive, and physically move it between computers. Physical access is easier to control than an electronic network interface, which can be attacked at any time from the exterior insecure system and, if malware infects the secure system, can be used to export secure data. In environments where networks or devices are rated to handle different levels of classified information, the two disconnected devices or networks are referred to as \\"low side\\" and \\"high side\\", \\"low\\" being unclassified and \\"high\\" referring to classified, or classified at a higher level. This is also occasionally referred to as \\"red\\" (classified) and \\"black\\" (unclassified). Access policies are often based on the Bell‚ÄìLaPadula confidentiality model, where data can be moved low-to-high with minimal security measures, while high-to-low requires much more stringent procedures to ensure protection of the data at a higher level of classification. The concept represents nearly the maximum protection one network can have from another (save turning the device off). The only way to transfer data between the outside world and the air-gapped system is to copy data on a removable storage medium such as a removable disk or USB flash drive and physically carry the storage to the other system. This access can be more easily controlled. The upside to this is that such a network can generally be regarded as a closed system (in terms of information, signals, and emissions security), unable to be accessed from the outside world. The downside is that transferring information (from the outside world) to be analyzed by computers on the secure network is extraordinarily labor-intensive, often involving human security analysis of prospective programs or data to be entered onto air-gapped networks and possibly even human manual re-entry of the data following security analysis. Sophisticated computer viruses for use in cyberwarfare, such as Stuxnet and agent.btz have been designed to infect air-gapped systems by exploiting security holes related to the handling of removable media. The possibility of using acoustic communication has also been demonstrated by researchers. Researchers have also demonstrated the feasibility of data exfiltration using FM frequency signals.  Examples  Examples of the types of networks or systems that may be air gapped include: * Military/governmental computer networks/systems; * Financial computer systems, such as stock exchanges; * Industrial control systems, such as SCADA in Oil & Gas fields; * Life-critical systems, such as:  Controls of nuclear power plants;  Computers used in aviation, such as FADECs, air traffic control systems, and avionics;  Computerized medical equipment; * Very simple systems, where there is no need to compromise security in the first place, such as:  The engine control unit and other devices on the CAN bus in an automobile;  A digital thermostat for temperature and compressor regulation in home HVAC and refrigeration systems;  Electronic sprinkler controls for watering of lawns. Many of these systems have since added features that connect them to the public internet, and are no longer effectively air gapped, including thermostats with internet connections and automobiles with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular phone connectivity.  Limitations  Limitations imposed on devices used in these environments may include a ban on wireless connections to or from the secure network, or similar restrictions on EM leakage from the secure network through the use of TEMPEST or a Faraday cage. Despite a lack of direct connection to other systems, air-gapped networks have been shown to be vulnerable to attack in various circumstances. Scientists in 2013 demonstrated the viability of air gap malware designed to defeat air gap isolation using acoustic signaling. Shortly after that, network security researcher Dragos Ruiu's BadBIOS received press attention. In 2014, researchers introduced \\"AirHopper\\", a bifurcated attack pattern showing the feasibility of data exfiltration from an isolated computer to a nearby mobile phone, using FM frequency signals. In 2015, BitWhisper, a covert signaling channel between air-gapped computers using thermal manipulations was introduced. BitWhisper supports bidirectional communication and requires no additional dedicated peripheral hardware. Later in 2015, researchers introduced GSMem, a method for exfiltrating data from air-gapped computers over cellular frequencies. The transmission - generated by a standard internal bus - renders the computer into a small cellular transmitter antenna. ProjectSauron malware discovered in 2016 demonstrates how an infected USB device can be used to remotely leak data off of an air-gapped computer. The malware remained undetected for 5 years and relied on hidden partitions on a USB drive not visible to Windows as a transport channel between the air-gapped computer and a computer connected to the internet, presumably as a way to share files between the two systems. NFCdrip was the name given to the discovery of stealthy data exfiltration through NFC (Near- field communication) radio abuse and signal detection in 2018. Although NFC enables devices to establish effective communication by bringing them within a few centimeters of each other, researchers showed that it can be abused to transmit information at a much longer range than expected - up to 100 meters. In general, malware can exploit various hardware combinations to leak sensitive information from air-gapped systems using \\"air-gap covert channels\\".Carrara, Brent (September 2016). ‚ÄúAir-Gap Covert Channels.‚Äù Ph. D. Thesis. University of Ottawa. These hardware combinations use a number of different mediums to bridge the air-gap, including: acoustic, light, seismic, magnetic, thermal, and radio-frequency.

It was refurbished in the 2000s and reopened as a concert venue on February 5, 2009. History Originally intended to be named \\"The Bagdad\\" because of its Middle Eastern influenced architecture, the theater instead displayed the name \\"The Oakland\\" on the marquee, with the word \\"Oakland\\" forming the main portion of the vertical blade sign above the marquee. It was also known as the \\"West Coast Oakland\\". The Oakland became the 251st theater to open in the West Coast Theater chain.Fox Oakland Theatre Restoration Project. 2007. Oct. 2009 . Opening day was October 27, 1928, after two years of construction.Bagwell, Beth. Oakland: The Story of a City. Oakland Heritage Alliance, 1996. The opening celebration was highly anticipated by the Bay Area residents, as the theater's 3,200 seats made it the largest in Oakland, more than the nearby Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco which held 2,561, and more than the new 1,075-seat Dufwin which had opened three weeks earlier. The first film shown at the Oakland was Fox's The Air Circus, an early sound film. Live performances took place on stage between films and newsreels, including \\"King of the Banjo\\" Eddie Peabody. House Music was provided by the Hermie King band with 20 members, and by an organist playing the house organ, a Wurlitzer Opus 1960 with 3 manuals and 15 ranks of pipes. A staff of 150 was required to run the theater. In March 1929, the theater was renamed the \\"Fox Oakland\\" when William Fox bought the West Coast Theatres chain and merged it with his Fox Theatres chain. The launch of the Fox was expected to earn high earnings in the downtown district. Reestablishing the movie industry, the Fox offered the opportunity to stray from the silent films and helped introduce the ‚Äútalkies‚Äù by having a live stage show.The Fox Oakland. 2009. Another Planet. Oct. 2009 <> Years of Closure Attendance significantly dropped in the 1960s and on September 14, 1965 the Fox closed, \\"temporarily,\\" according to the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"The movie ... which will be shown on the Fox Oakland's last day is the Marlon Brando spy melodrama, Morituri\\". During the next seven years the theater opened sporadically for movies and special events, but never found a market that could support the required overhead and maintenance.http://www.foxoakland.org/index.php?page=history In 1973 the theater building was twice the victim of arson after the owner refused to hire a quota of Black Panthers and pay for their \\"protection\\".https://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/22/opinion/op-coleman22 In 1977 the theater was used during the filming of the horror film Nightmare in Blood directed by John Stanley.http://www.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/10/10/homegrown- horror-1978s-nightmare-in-blood-unleashes-a-vampire-on-san-francisco In 1983 and 1984 the Dickens Fair used the theater for Victorian England reenactments, setting up a mock village. By 1975 the building was in such disrepair that the City's Public Works Department presented a plan for the City to purchase the property, demolish the building, and create a parking lot. However, their plans floundered and on Jan. 24 1978 the Mann Theater Group sold the theater at auction to Mario and Erma DeLucchi for $340,000. A few months after the purchase, Mr. DeLucchi died of a heart attack and plans for a restoration of the theater never took off. With the support of then-Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson the building was designated an Oakland City Landmark in 1978 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places the following year. Restoration In 1996, the Oakland Redevelopment Agency bought the building for $3 million. In 1999 a group of concerned citizens formed the Friends of The Oakland Fox and some badly needed restoration work began.http://www.foxoakland.org/ In December 2004, the Oakland Redevelopment Agency received a $2.9 million grant for further restoration of the theater. When mayor Jerry Brown needed to find a new home for the Oakland School for the Arts, a charter high school dedicated to the arts, the task fell to the Redevelopment Staff who conceived of the idea of placing the school in the retail and office space that surrounded, and were part of, the Fox Theatre building. Restoring and reopening the theater in a shared use plan with the school was quickly championed by local developer Phil Tagami. Friends of the Oakland Fox played a role with the Oakland Redevelopment Agency in raising funding for the elaborate $75 million restoration process. Reopening February 2009 marked the beginning of a new era for the Fox. After being neglected for forty years, the once glamorous theater made its comeback as a 2,800-seat concert hall. Accentuating its revival, the theater's grand opening night featured a ‚Äúroaring twenties‚Äù theme celebrating the newly renovated theater MC'ed by Oakland native, comedian Don Reed (East 14th, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Snap Judgment). The first paid performance after reopening was Social Distortion 7 The Oakland Fox Theatre now serves as a school, restaurant, and prominent live concert venue. It has hosted many concerts by artists such as B.B. King, Paul Simon, Korn, Kylie Minogue, The Allman Brothers, Widespread Panic, Bob Dylan, Green Day, Twenty One Pilots, Marina and the Diamonds, Metallica, Primus, Alice in Chains, Atoms For Peace, Black Star, Lorde, Animal Collective, X Japan, The Decemberists, and Van Morrison since 2009.

Rudy's closed on Thursday, July 26, 2018. Architecture With terra cotta, rich colors, intricate gold accents, and distinctive dome, the theater's design redefined architecture in the 1920s. The interior of the Fox Theatre was delicately crafted and said to be described as ‚Äúmystical‚Äù. With its intriguing resemblance of an Indian temple, the Fox Theatre was a fascinating attribute to downtown Oakland. At this time, theaters across the nation strived to be more than just a typical building. The designs of various theaters were inspired greatly by Middle Eastern and Indian architecture.

Nursery school in Colombia  Most of the children over one year old are provided with daycare and nursery school in \\"Hogares Comunitarios\\" (community homes) sponsored by the National Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF acronym in Spanish), where mothers from the community take care of their own children, as well as the children from the immediate neighborhood. When children of Colombia learn how to read and write, they are usually transferred to the elementary school. There are also a large number of private kindergarten facilities.Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar  Elementary school  A public school in Bogot√°. Elementary school comprises 5 years of formal education. Children usually enroll into grade 1, at age five. The net primary enrollment (percentage of relevant age-group) attending elementary school (primaria) in 2001 totaled 89.5 percent. In some rural areas, teachers are poorly qualified and drop rates are high. In urban areas, on the other hand, teachers are generally well prepared and knowledgeable of their profession. Colombia developed the method of teaching known as Escuela Nueva or ‚ÄúNew School.‚Äù The method transforms the conventional learning paradigm where the teacher is the only one talking and conveying information in a classroom. The idea is that students are placed in the center of the learning process in rural communities. Decades after the model was first developed in 1975, Escuela Nueva has received support ‚Äî including financial ‚Äî from the Colombian government, Unesco, and The World Bank, and was implemented into a national educational policy in Colombia in the late 1980s. By 1988, Unesco declared that Colombia was the only country in Latin America and the Caribbean where rural schools outperformed urban schools because of the Escuela Nueva method. Between 2007 and 2009, the program taught 700,000 children in Colombia, and the model is now implemented in 20,000 schools across the country. Escuela Nueva has now expanded internationally to 17 countries, including Brazil, the Philippines and India, benefiting more than five million children.  Secondary school  Secondary and fourth education is divided in basic secondary (grades 6 to 9) and mid secondary (grades 10 and 11). The upper-secondary education (usually beginning at the age of 15 or 16) offers many different \\"tracks\\", which all lead to their own \\"Bachiller\\" after a curriculum of two years. Out of the usual academic curriculum (Bachillerato Acad√©mico), the students can follow one of the following technical tracks (Bachillerato en Tecnolog√≠a o Aplicado): Industrial track (Bachillerato Industrial), Commercial track (Bachillerato Comercial), Pedagogical Track (Bachillerato Pedag√≥gico), Agricultural Track (Bachillerato Agropecuario), social promotion track (Bachillerato de Promoci√≥n Social). The \\"Bachiller\\" is required to continue into academic or professional higher Education. Nonetheless, technical and professional institutions of higher Education can also welcome students with a \\"qualification in Arts and business\\". This qualification is granted by the SENA after a two-year curriculum.  University education  Che Square or Santander Square, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogot√° University education is divided into under-graduate degrees and post-graduate degrees and is regulated by the 30th law of 1992. Most of the university degrees are 5 years long. Technical formation usually lasts 3 years. Post-graduate education includes specializations, masters and PhD programs. Admissions are done by using grades obtained in the national school leaving exam Saber 11.  Education for Employment and Human Development  Education for Employment and Human Development is regulated by law 1064 of 2006 and the 2888 decree of 2007.

Education for employment involves technical skills for work through the formation of \\"labor competences\\", which is a Colombian strategy to standardize and certify human resource, expanding and diversify the formation and training of human resources. It includes the education provided by the enterprises to their employees. The Colombian government promotes this kind of education as an alternative to university education, which is not accessible for the majority. Some institutions that provide this services are SENA (national service of learning), CESDE, ANDAP, and INCAP among others.  Challenges  Two issues are identified among the main challenges of the public education in the country. On the one hand, 55% of children attending rural schools drop out before concluding their studies. Rural education represents 80% of the educational offer, with many isolated schools and some of them lacking electricity. A high rate of rural illiteracy is observed (average urban rate was 5.4% and rural 18.6%). On the other hand, the quality of education is a great concern. According to the OECD, the result from the PISA‚Äôs test for Colombia in 2006 in Mathematics is below the ones obtained by 61 countries and similar to the countries that obtained the three lowest results.

The term valley of tears is also used sometimes. The phrase appears in some translations of Psalm 84:6, which describes those strengthened by God's blessing: even in the valley of tears () they find life-giving water. The Sixto-Clementine version of the Latin Vulgate uses the phrase \\"valle lacrimarum\\" in Psalm 83:7 (the equivalent of Psalm 84:6 in English translations). Wycliffe's Bible (1395) reads \\"valei of teeris\\", and the Bishop's Bible (1568) reads \\"vale of teares\\". The King James Version (1611), however, reads \\"valley of Baca\\", and the Psalter in the Book of Common Prayer (1662) follows the Coverdale Bible (1535) and reads \\"vale of misery\\". The phrase also occurs in the writings of Jerome (c. 347‚Äì420)Jerome, In Hieremiam prophetam libri vi 5 (CSEL 59, p. 299, line 17); Tractatus lix in psalmos 83 (CCSL 78, line 132); Tractatus lix in psalmos 136 (CCSL 78, line 7) and Boniface (c. 675‚Äì754),Boniface and Lull, Epistolae 112, 129 but was perhaps popularized by the hymn \\"Salve Regina\\", which at the end of the first stanza mentions \\"gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle\\", or \\"mourning and weeping in this valley of tears\\".

He was Harvard educated and fought in the North Carolina militia during the French and Indian War. During the American Revolution, he attained the rank of major general and was in charge of North Carolina militia and state troops from 1776 to 1779. He resigned from military service after the Patriot defeat at the Battle of Brier Creek in 1779. Early life John Ashe was born at Grovely, New Hanover County, North Carolina (now Brunswick County, North Carolina) on March 24, 1725. His parents were Elizabeth Swann and John Baptista Ashe. His father, born in England and settled in the Cape Fear region of the Province of North Carolina, was a member of the Governor's Council and died in 1734. John Ashe was a member of Harvard University class of 1746 but did not graduate. He settled on the northeast Cape Fear River, where he built a plantation called Green Hill. Ashe served as a colonel in the Province of North Carolina militia during the French and Indian War (17541763). In 1752, he was elected to the North Carolina House of Burgesses and served as Speaker of the House of Burgesses from 1762 to 1765 (his father, John Baptista Ashe, had served as speaker in 1726-27). He was known for his eloquence and strong will. An outspoken opponent of the Stamp Act and eventually a supporter of independence from Great Britain, Ashe served in the North Carolina Provincial Congress and on both the committees of correspondence and safety as hostilities between the colonies and Great Britain began to rise. Revolutionary War As a result of his opposition to the Stamp Act, he resigned his royal commission as a colonel in the militia and was elected colonel in the patriot militia by the people of New Hanover County in 1775. In January of 1776, he was commissioned as the commandant with a rank of colonel over the Volunteer Independent Rangers. Leading a force of 500 men, Ashe destroyed the British garrison of Fort Johnston (near present-day Wilmington, North Carolina) in 1775. Raising and equipping this unit at his own expense, Ashe led his regiment in the American victory at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge on February 27, 1776. The unit was disbanded after this battle. On May 4, 1776, he was commissioned as brigadier general of the Wilmington District Brigade of the North Carolina militia. Under his leadership, he constructed defenses for an anticipated British assault on the Cape Fear region. However, the British bypassed Cape Fear and went to Charleston, instead. On November 8, 1778, he was commissioned as North Carolina's first major general and placed in command of all North Carolina's militia by Governor Richard Casswell. =Brier Creek= He was dispatched to support Continental Army Major General Benjamin Lincoln following the British capture of Savannah, Georgia in late 1778. Ashe's troops first marched to Purrysburg, South Carolina, where Lincoln had established his camp, but was then sent north to join forces threatening Augusta, Georgia, which was being held by British Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell. Ashe's advance in early February 1779 prompted Campbell to abandon Augusta, and Ashe followed him southward in Georgia. Ashe halted just above Briar Creek, where the British had burned out a bridge during their retreat, and established a camp while he traveled back to South Carolina for a war council with Lincoln. Ashe returned to the Brier Creek camp on March 2. Lieutenant Colonel Campbell had, however, been active. In a plan that was well executed by Colonel Mark Prevost, most of the British force embarked on a lengthy detour to flank Ashe's camp while a diversionary force demonstrated on the far side of the burned-out bridge. The British approached his camp from the rear on March 3, with Ashe's force having just 15 minutes notice to prepare for the onslaught. Ashe's poorly trained and supplied militia were routed, with an estimated 150 casualties compared to around 16 British casualties. Ashe was subjected to a court martial, which found that although he was not entirely to blame for the debacle, he was guilty of setting inadequate guards around his camp. Service Record: *Colonel over the New Hannover County Regiment, North Carolina militia (early 1775) *Colonel over the Volunteer Independent Rangers (1776) *Brigadier General of the Wilmington District Brigade of North Carolina militia (1776-1778) *Major General over all North Carolina militia and state troops (1778-1779) After he resigned his commission, William Smallwood of Maryland was selected to command the North Carolina militia in 1780 and 1781. =Capture and death= Returning to Wilmington, he remained active there in suppressing Loyalist activity in the district. He was captured and held as a prisoner of war following the town's occupation in 1781 by the army of General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis. Contracting smallpox while imprisoned, Ashe was paroled, but died in Sampson County on October 24 shortly after his release. One of his sons, John Ashe Jr., served as a captain in the 4th North Carolina Regiment. Governor Samuel Ashe, for whom Asheville, North Carolina was named, was his younger brother, and other descendants (not named Ashe since none of their male children had offspring) have continued to play a role in North Carolina politics, including Margaret Ashe Pruette, arrested as part of Moral Monday during the 2013 North Carolina legislative protests.

The chemical reaction catalyzed by enolase is: :2-phospho-D-glycerate \\\\rightleftharpoons phosphoenolpyruvate + H2O Enolase belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme is 2-phospho-D-glycerate hydro-lyase (phosphoenolpyruvate-forming). The reaction is reversible, depending on environmental concentrations of substrates. The optimum pH for the human enzyme is 6.5. Enolase is present in all tissues and organisms capable of glycolysis or fermentation. The enzyme was discovered by Lohmann and Meyerhof in 1934,Lohman K & Meyerhof O (1934) √úber die enzymatische umwandlung von phosphoglyzerins√§ure in brenztraubens√§ure und phosphors√§ure (Enzymatic transformation of phosphoglyceric acid into pyruvic and phosphoric acid). Biochem Z 273, 60‚Äì72. and has since been isolated from a variety of sources including human muscle and erythrocytes. In humans, deficiency of ENO1 is linked to hereditary haemolytic anemia, while ENO3 deficiency is linked to glycogen storage disease type X.  Isozymes  In humans there are three subunits of enolase, Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥, each encoded by a separate gene that can combine to form five different isoenzymes: Œ±Œ±, Œ±Œ≤, Œ±Œ≥, Œ≤Œ≤, and Œ≥Œ≥. Three of these isoenzymes (all homodimers) are more commonly found in adult human cells than the others: * Œ±Œ± or non-neuronal enolase (NNE). Also known as enolase 1. Found in a variety of tissues, including liver, brain, kidney, spleen, adipose. It is present at some level in all normal human cells. * Œ≤Œ≤ or muscle-specific enolase (MSE). Also known as enolase 3. This enzyme is largely restricted to muscle where it is present at very high levels in muscle. * Œ≥Œ≥ or neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Also known as enolase 2. Expressed at very high levels in neurons and neural tissues, where it can account for as much as 3% of total soluble protein. It is expressed at much lower levels in most mammalian cells. When present in the same cell, different isozymes readily form heterodimers.  Structure  Enolase is a member of the large enolase superfamily. It has a molecular weight of 82,000-100,000 Daltons depending on the isoform. In human alpha enolase, the two subunits are antiparallel in orientation so that Glu20 of one subunit forms an ionic bond with Arg414 of the other subunit. Each subunit has two distinct domains. The smaller N-terminal domain consists of three Œ±-helices and four Œ≤-sheets. The larger C-terminal domain starts with two Œ≤-sheets followed by two Œ±-helices and ends with a barrel composed of alternating Œ≤-sheets and Œ±-helices arranged so that the Œ≤-beta sheets are surrounded by the Œ±-helices. The enzyme's compact, globular structure results from significant hydrophobic interactions between these two domains. Enolase is a highly conserved enzyme with five active-site residues being especially important for activity. When compared to wild-type enolase, a mutant enolase that differs at either the Glu168, Glu211, Lys345, or Lys396 residue has an activity level that is cut by a factor of 105. Also, changes affecting His159 leave the mutant with only 0.01% of its catalytic activity. An integral part of enolase are two Mg2+ cofactors in the active site, which serve to stabilize negative charges in the substrate. Recently, moonlighting functions of several enolases, such as interaction with plasminogen, have brought interest to the enzymes' catalytic loops and their structural diversity.  Mechanism  Mechanism for conversion of 2PG to PEP. Using isotopic probes, the overall mechanism for converting 2-PG to PEP is proposed to be an E1cB elimination reaction involving a carbanion intermediate. The following detailed mechanism is based on studies of crystal structure and kinetics. When the substrate, 2-phosphoglycerate, binds to Œ±-enolase, its carboxyl group coordinates with two magnesium ion cofactors in the active site. This stabilizes the negative charge on the deprotonated oxygen while increasing the acidity of the alpha hydrogen. Enolase's Lys345 deprotonates the alpha hydrogen, and the resulting negative charge is stabilized by resonance to the carboxylate oxygen and by the magnesium ion cofactors. Following the creation of the carbanion intermediate, the hydroxide on C3 is eliminated as water with the help of Glu211, and PEP is formed. Additionally, conformational changes occur within the enzyme that aid catalysis. In human Œ±-enolase, the substrate is rotated into position upon binding to the enzyme due to interactions with the two catalytic magnesium ions, Gln167, and Lys396. Movements of loops Ser36 to His43, Ser158 to Gly162, and Asp255 to Asn256 allow Ser39 to coordinate with Mg2+ and close off the active site. In addition to coordination with the catalytic magnesium ions, the pKa of the substrate's alpha hydrogen is also lowered due to protonation of the phosphoryl group by His159 and its proximity to Arg374. Arg374 also causes Lys345 in the active site to become deprotonated, which primes Lys345 for its role in the mechanism.  Diagnostic uses  In recent medical experiments, enolase concentrations have been sampled in an attempt to diagnose certain conditions and their severity. For example, higher concentrations of enolase in cerebrospinal fluid more strongly correlated to low-grade astrocytoma than did other enzymes tested (aldolase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase). The same study showed that the fastest rate of tumor growth occurred in patients with the highest levels of CSF enolase. Increased levels of enolase have also been identified in patients who have suffered a recent myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. It has been inferred that levels of CSF neuron- specific enolase, serum NSE, and creatine kinase (type BB) are indicative in the prognostic assessment of cardiac arrest victims. Other studies have focused on the prognostic value of NSE values in cerebrovascular accident victims. Autoantibodies to alpha-enolase are associated with the rare syndrome called Hashimoto's encephalopathy.  Inhibitors  Small-molecule inhibitors of enolase have been synthesized as chemical probes (substrate-analogues) of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and more recently, have been investigated as potential treatments for cancer and infectious diseases. Most inhibitors have metal chelating properties and bind to enzyme by interactions with the structural Magnesium Atom Mg(A). The most potent of these is phosphonoacetohydroxamate, which in its unprotonated form has pM affinity for the enzyme. It has structural similarity to the presumed catalytic intermediate, between PEP and 2-PG. Attempts have been made to use this inhibitor as an anti-trypanosome drug, and more recently, as an anti-cancer agent, specifically, in glioblastoma that are enolase-deficient due to homozygous deletion of the ENO1 gene as part of the 1p36 tumor suppressor locus (synthetic lethality). A natural product phosphonate antibiotic, SF2312 (CAS 107729-45-3), which is active against gram positive and negative bacteria especially under anaerobic conditions, is a high potency inhibitor of Enolase that binds in manner similar to phoshphonoacetohydroxamate . An allosteric binder, ENOblock was initially described as an inhibitor of Enolase, but subsequently shown not to actually inhibit the enzyme, but rather, interfere with the Enolase in vitro enzymatic assay. ENOblock was found to alter the cellular localization of enolase, influencing its secondary, non-glycolytic functions, such as transcription regulation. Subsequent analysis using a commercial assay also indicated that ENOblock can inhibit enolase activity in biological contexts, such as cells and animal tissues. Methylglyoxal has also been described as an inhibitor of human enolase. Fluoride is a known competitor of enolase's substrate 2-PG. Fluoride can a complex with magnesium and phosphate, which binds in the active site instead of 2-PG. One study found that fluoride could inhibit bacterial enolase in vitro  References   Further reading   Boyer, P.D., Lardy, H. and Myrback, K.

The song is played as the winning team's players cut down the nets, to a montage of highlights from the tournament. History Barrett, a singer-songwriter from Michigan was inspired to write the song in 1986 while watching Larry Bird play on TV at a bar called the Varsity Inn in East Lansing, Michigan, after having played a gig there. He wrote the song down on a napkin the next day, later stating that \\"the song came fully formed\\" and \\"all the lyrics just wrote themselves.\\" He passed the song along to high school friend Armen Keteyian, an investigative journalist for CBS Sports and, at that time, Sports Illustrated, who in turn passed it to CBS Sports Creative Director Doug Towey. However, Towey originally planned to debut the song not after a basketball game, but after a football game, Super Bowl XXI. It was to have been the post-game montage from that contest, but CBS ran past the expected airtime and had a prime time show to debut in the next time slot, so the montage was canceled. CBS then asked Barrett for use of the song after the 1987 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, in which 1986-87 Indiana Hoosier men's basketball tournament beat 1986-87 Syracuse Orangemen basketball tournament. Towey decided to use \\"One Shining Moment\\" to close CBS's coverage of the Tournament. The positive public response led to it becoming an annual feature. Since 2016, TBS, in the even-numbered years, and CBS, the odd- numbered years, broadcasts the championship game biennially. At the beginning of this arrangement there were concerns that the song would not be used in these years due to its association with CBS. However, on March 16, 2016, CBS Sports chairman Sean McManus confirmed that \\"One Shining Moment\\" would still be used during years that Turner Sports broadcasts the championship game under the consortium's contract, owing to the long-standing tradition. In 2020, the NCAA announced a contest telling basketball fans to perform their own rendition of the song, with the winning rendition being played on TBS during the pregame show on April 6th. However, due to the cancelation of the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, the contest was canceled. In addition, because the tournament was canceled, the song was not played during the postgame for the first time since 1986. Barrett graduated from Albion College in 1977 https://www.gobrits.com/information/HOF/bios/David_Barrett_77?view=bio  Versions  The original version recorded by Barrett was used from 1987 to 1993, and briefly revived between 2000 and 2002 with a new instrumental. Versions recorded by Teddy Pendergrass (1994-1999), Luther Vandross (2003-2009, since 2011), and Ne-Yo (2016) have also been used; Vandross' version is believed to be the last song he recorded before his stroke and subsequent death. A version by Jennifer Hudson was used for the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament; the format of the Hudson video deviated from prior years by cutting away from the tournament highlight montage on several occasions to show footage of Hudson singing in a recording studio, drawing criticism from some fans and viewers. In response to the criticism, the Vandross version was restored the following year. On April 1, 2016, Turner announced that Ne-Yo had performed a version of \\"One Shining Moment\\" that would be used on the \\"Team Stream\\" broadcasts of the championship game on TNT and TruTV, which were tailored to focus on highlights of the two participating teams, as with the game broadcasts on these channels themselves. The Vandross version was still used for the main telecast on TBS. In an effort to give the song \\"Turner flair\\" in honor of TBS's first national championship game broadcast, and to make light of the concerns regarding its use by the network, analyst Charles Barkley performed his own \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" cover of \\"One Shining Moment\\" in a commercial promoting that year's tournament. Lyrics The first verse is about inspiration and hard work. The second verse deals with adversity, accompanied by highlights of injured players and missed shots. The bridge includes lines such as \\"Feel the beat of your heart\\", often shown with players thumping their chests, and \\"Feel the wind in your face\\", with video of drives towards the basket. There is a claim that the first line in the song was changed from \\"The ball is kicked\\" to \\"The ball is tipped.\\" However, Barrett said \\"My daughter informed me that they claim that the initial line was the ball is kicked. That's not the case. It never was. The original line was, the gun goes off...which I changed to suit the tournament. Ironically - I wrote the song about basketball (after watching Larry Bird) but for some reason (who knows what I was thinking?!?) I didn't write it into the original first line. And so having the first line fall into place as it did was poetic and true.\\" The Chicago White Sox used the version with \\"The Gun Goes Off\\" to close their telecast on the final game at Comiskey Park on September 30, 1990.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9irBc45gxA References External links *\\"One Shining Moment\\" official site Lyrics *\\"One Shining Moment\\" videos from 1987 to 2019 CBS Sports Turner Sports NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament Sports theme music Television theme songs College basketball mass media in the United States College basketball on television in the United States National Football League music 1987 songs Teddy Pendergrass songs Luther Vandross songs Jennifer Hudson songs Ne-Yo songs ","title":"One Shining Moment"},{"id":"3825213","text":"The Giant Anteater, one of the inhabitants of Los Kat√≠os. Los Kat√≠os National Natural Park () is a protected area located in northwest Colombia which covers about . The elevation ranges between . It is a part of the Dari√©n Gap, a densely forested area shared by Panama and Colombia, and is contiguous with the Dari√©n National Park in Panama. The Pan-American Highway, when completed as proposed, would pass near or through Los Kat√≠os. The park was declared a World Heritage Site in 1994 due to the extraordinary diversity of plant and animal species represented. The park contains over 25% of the bird species reported for Colombia in an area less than 1% of the total Colombian territory. The topography of the Los Katios National Park is diverse, with low hills, forests and wet plains comprising its total area. The two largest parts of the park are the Serran√≠a del Dari√©n mountains, which lie to the west, and the Atrato River floodplains in the east. The floodplains hold exceptionally fertile soil and consist of alluvial plains of two types. One consists of low- lying terraces that flood often and the other has high terraces that seldom flood. There are also low hills of up to in elevation and others that are high. Swampy marshes spread for nearly half of the park's total area. The wetlands of the Atrato floodplain are unique. Cativo, one of the indigenous species, can grow to a height of . It lends its name to a formation called 'catival', something that is found nowhere in the world except Colombia, south Central America and Jamaica.  Significance  The significance of Los Kat√≠os lies in its exceptionally high biodiversity and the protection of species found only in the Dari√©n region. Due to its geographical location in northern Colombia on the southern edge of the Central American land bridge, this region served as a filter for the exchange of animal species between North and South America in the Tertiary and Pleistocene periods. This process continues today. Los Kat√≠os is the only region in South America where Central American yews (taxus) can be found. The park also protects important landscape features such as the 25 m high Tendal waterfall, the 100 m high Tilupo waterfall and the Tumarad√≥ swamps. In 1990, the park was made accessible by paths and accommodation for small groups of visitors, who have access to the national park through the park administration in Sautat√°.  History  The region was originally inhabited by the Kuna, an indigenous group who, after internal fighting, had to surrender the Choc region to the Kat√≠o-Embera and emigrated to Panama. The Dari√©n region, to which Los Kat√≠os belongs, was historically important for the first settlers who used the land bridge from North to South America some 20,000 years ago. In the post-Columbian period, the Spanish conquistadors Rodrigo de Bastidas, Alonso de Ojeda and Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa were the first to discover this region in 1501. In more recent times, about one percent of the park in the Sautat√° area was agriculturally developed and used primarily for the cultivation of sugar cane. After the park was established in 1974, over the next seven years the 150 or so local families were relocated to the nearby towns of Ungu√≠a, Puente Am√©rica, Tumarad√≥ and Cacarica. The park was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2009 at the request of the Colombian government to handle threats to its protection, notably deforestation, unauthorized settlements, illegal fishing and hunting. In 2015, the park was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger due to significant improvements in the management of the park and of steps taken by the national authorities to reduce illegal extraction of timber and overfishing.

The Mark VI 4-door standard steel sports saloonBrochure (sports saloons) was the first post-war luxury car from Bentley. Announced in May 1946First Post-War Bentley. The Times, Thursday, 23 May 1946; pg. 7; Issue 50459; col C From our motoring correspondent The first post-war Bentley model, known as the -litre Mark VI, will be ready next month. It is an improved version of the 1939 car, and experimental models have been tested for several years, one having covered over 100, 000 miles. Modifications include: a new frontal appearance; overhead inlet and side exhaust valves; chromium-plated cylinder bores; independent front suspension by helical springs; a new and stronger chassis frame; a divided propeller shaft which eliminates the need for a tunnel in the floor boards; and improved brakes. In the past Bentley Motors have made chassis only but the Mark VI will be sold as a complete four door sports saloon at ¬£2,997 including purchase tax. Other models will be available with coachwork by Park Ward, James Young and H J Mulliner at prices from ¬£3,450 to ¬£3,910. The chassis alone costs ¬£1,785. and produced from 1946 to 1952 it was also both the first car from Rolls-Royce with all-steel coachwork and the first complete car assembled and finished at their factory. These very expensive cars were a genuine success; long-term, their weakness lay in the inferior steels forced on them by government's post- war controls. Chassis continued to be supplied to independent coachbuilders. Four-door Saloon, two-door saloon and drophead coupe models with bodies by external companies were listed by Bentley along with the Bentley-bodied saloon. This first Bentley factory finished car was given the name Bentley Mark VI standard steel sports saloon. This shorter wheelbase chassis and engine was a variant of the Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith of 1946 and, with the same standard steel body, became the cautiously introduced Silver Dawn of 1949. In 1952 both Rolls Royce Silver Dawn and Bentley Mk VI standard steel bodies were modified to incorporate a boot of about twice the size and the result became known as the R type Bentley based on the Chassis number at which the change took place.Display Advertising: Announcing Important New Developments The Times, Friday, 19 September 1952; pg. 3; Issue 52421; col FTaylor, James.

A very few Mark VI engines and chassis were modified to provide higher performance and sold to be bodied by selected coachbuilders as the first Bentley Continentals (see below).Taylor, James. Original Rolls-Royce & Bentley 1946-65: The Restorer's Guide to the 'standard' saloons and mainstream coachbuilt derivatives (Original Series). P67. Herridge & Sons Ltd., 2008. . Engine The Mark VI -litre used an F-head straight-6 engine 4.3 L (4,257 cc/259 cu in) in size. The manufacturer refused to disclose a horse power value for the car (other than Tax Horsepower of 29.4 hp according to the old RAC formula) but an Autocar Magazine road test reproduced in 1950 reported that top gear provided \\"flexibility down to 6 mph (10 km/h)\\" and the ability to \\"climb a hill of 1 in 9 maximum gradient, complicated by bends\\", all of which supported the manufacturer's contention that power, along with low speed torque, were adequate. a 4¬º Litre engine. In 1951, a -litre, 4.6 L (4,566 cc/278 cu in) version of the engine was introduced. The increase in displacement was accomplished by increasing the bore from 3 1/2 inch to 3 5/8 inch. The later version is sometimes casually referred to as the \\"big bore\\" engine, the earlier version as the \\"small bore\\" version. The 4 1/2 L version of the engine is as well equipped with a Vokes 30 (later: Vokes 62) full flow oil filter (some earlier 4 1/4 L cars have since been modified to a full flow filtration system).Taylor, James.

Carburation in RHD (right hand drive) cars were two horizontal constant-vacuum SU carburetors (type H4 up to B81HP, type H6 from B83 HP on).

The \\"big bore\\" cars serial numbers begin with B 1 MB (although B 2 MD was the first big bore Mark VI built) and ended with B 300 PV (although B 301 PU was the last one built). Each alphabetic series only contained either even or odd numbers, and 13 was always skipped for the odd-numbered sequences. The was referred to as the L and can be quickly identified from its single exhaust in RHD cars. The is known as the L and features a twin exhaust in RHD cars. In LHD cars the (much less restrictive) twin exhaust system was only fitted with the introduction of the R-type.Taylor, James.

In addition for \\"standard steel\\" Mark VI saloons the single hinged ventilation flap centrally mounted on the top of the bonnet, directly ahead of the windscreen was replaced, on later cars, with two hinged ventilation flaps, mounted at or slightly below knee height, one on each side of the bonnet, ahead of the front doors. The oil filler cap is another way to identify engine type; a plastic cap is typical of a \\"small bore\\" engine, a metal cap of a \\"large bore\\" engine. Chassis and running gear The chassis used leaf springs at the rear and independent coil springing at the front. A control on the steering wheel centre adjusts the hardness of the rear springing by hydraulically adjusting the rear dampers. This is done via opening a check valve that provides pressure by diverting transmission oil to the dampers. A pedal-operated central lubrication system type Bijur-Girling allows oil to be applied to moving parts of the suspension from a central reservoir by using a foot pedal. The drum brakes were assisted by the traditional Rolls-Royce mechanical servo at the transmission. Standard Steel Saloon The all steel body of an early Mark VI Bentley Mark VI \\"standard steel\\" saloon, rear three quartersC-pillar. The principal difference was a much larger boot with a larger opening, which reflected changes in car design and usage, especially the key US and \\"British dominion\\" export markets, more generally. Employing its experience with the steel bodies made in short runs since 1936 by then partly-owned subsidiary Park Ward the Car Division of Rolls-Royce offered their lowest priced chassis with a factory-supplied body all-steel so it could be exported all over the world. The factory bodies with a Gurney-Nutting-Blatchley refined shape were made by Pressed Steel Ltd of Cowley and sent to the Bentley works at Crewe for painting and fitting out with traditional wood and leather. They featured rear hinged \\"suicide\\" doors at the front with concealed hinges, a sliding sunroof, a permanently closed windscreen with an electric defrosting and demisting unit hidden in the scuttle and a second heater that made use of the coolant and was fitted with an electric fan beneath the left front seat. Twin screenwipers were fitted and provision was made for the fitting of a radio with a short and flexibly mounted aerial that could be swung up above the centre of the screen. =Road test= A 4.6-litre, factory bodied car tested by The Motor magazine in 1951 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 15.0 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£4,473 including taxes. =Commercial= The Mark VI was introduced at a time of steel shortage across Europe which translated into a serious shortage of new cars for sale on the UK market. A Used Car report in 1951 of a three-year-old example with 10,450 miles (16,815 kilometres) on the odometer noted that a car which had, when new, retailed for ¬£4,038 including sales taxes, was now offered for sale at ¬£5,335. This was seen as a comment on the quality of the car but also on the continuing shortage of cars for sale. By the end of 1952 order-books had shrunk and the Mark VI was replaced by the R-Type, featuring an extended boot/trunk supported by an chassis that was extended by six inches behind the rear wheels. In addition, an automatic transmission option was now available, an automatic choke along with other less visible modifications were added and former export-only options were now available to the home-market.Taylor, James. Original Rolls-Royce & Bentley 1946-65: The Restorer's Guide to the 'standard' saloons and mainstream coachbuilt derivatives (Original Series). P42ff. Herridge & Sons Ltd., 2008. . The R-type led up to the introduction of the completely redesigned S series in 1955.

These chassis were produced between June 1952 and April 1953 and bear the chassis numbers BC1A to BC26A, with the prototype, totalling 27 cars. The engine compression was reduced on the last 8 cars. The bulk of the chassis were clothed by H J Mulliner but some were bodied in Europe. Only the 27 cars were built before the R designation was added to the chassis series identification.Chassis Numbers Booklet Rolls-Royce and Bentley Motor Cars Proudly provided by the Rolls-Royce Owners Club of Australia for all Rolls-Royce and Bentley Enthusiasts Gallery File:Bentley Mark VI 4-Door Saloon 1948.jpgstandard steel 4-door sports saloon 1947 Bentley MK VI 9483714377.jpgFigoni & Falaschi Paris fixed-head coup√© 1947 1947 Bentley Mark VI coup√© by Franay 4173055768.jpgFranay Paris drop-head coup√© 1947 Bentley limousine built 1947 reg 1994 4257 cc.JPGFreestone & Webb saloon 1947 File:1948 Bentley Mark VI James Young Sport Saloon - rvl.jpgJames Young sports saloon 1948 File:1949 Bentley Mark VI Park Ward Drop Head Coupe - svl.jpgPark Ward drophead coup√© 1949 File:1949 Bentley Mark VI Pininfarina Drophead - fvl.jpgStabilimenti Farina drophead coup√© 1949 1950 Bentley MK VI Hooper 7186547339.jpgHooper sports saloon 1950 1951 Bentley MK VI HJM 2-door saloon 8160965887.jpgH.J.

Drops may be designed to look flashy, painful, or both. A wide variety of other movements can serve the same purpose, and others such as the kip-up can work in reverse, moving the breaker up from the floor. Common drops Some of the most common drops are listed below. =Knee Drop= This drop makes the breaker seem to kick himself and fall painfully down onto his knee. From a standing position, the left leg lifts backwards. The left foot kicks quickly forward so that it slams into the back of the right knee in a \\"figure-four\\" position. As the right leg collapses, the breaker falls forward (not to either side!). Ideally unseen by observers, the left foot actually sticks out just to the right of the collapsing knee, and the toes should be pulled up hard. Instead of landing on the knee, the breaker lands on the toes of the left foot. =Sweep Drop= The breaker drops as one leg sweeps out around in a wide arc. As all the weight shifts to the left leg, the right leg kicks backwards. The left leg bends so that the body sinks toward the floor, and meanwhile, the right leg swings around toward the front of the body. The right (sweeping) leg remains straight throughout. By the time the right leg has swung around to point directly ahead, the left knee should be fully bent and the hands are ready to hit the floor and bear the body's weight. The swinging momentum continues into a 6-step or any other move. =Coin Drop= A Coin Drop is a transition made from Toprock directly into a Backspin, or more commonly into Windmills. It requires that the dancer shifts his/her weight from the left leg to the right leg, leans onto his/her right hand and then moves the weight onto his/her left hand/forearm - shoulder while his/her feet leave the ground. The momentum generated from performing a Coin Drop sends the dancer into a spin onto his/her back.

He was a well-known bohemian figure in San Francisco, the East Bay, and the Monterey Peninsula and one of the co-founders of two California artists' organizations and an art gallery. He painted in a tonalist style and also produced monotypes, etchings, and silverpoint. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/10aa/10aa557.htm) Childhood in Guadalajara He was originally christened Javier Timoteo Martinez y Orozco, but later called himself Xavier Tizoc Martinez, the middle name acknowledging his Pur√©pecha heritage. He was known to his friends as \\"Marty.\\" Martinez was born in Guadalajara in 1869 to a Mexican father and a Spanish mother. Martinez began drawing his classmates and teachers at a young age while attending public school. After school he worked in his father's bookstore bookbinding and helping with printing chores. He learned French and wrote poetry, admiring the poems of Goethe, Schiller and various French poets. In his later autobiographical writings he recalled how at age ten his mother would teach him about the movements of celestial bodies. Early life Photo of Martinez's studio with a caricature of the artist, San Francisco Call, 30 July 1905Martinez reflected that at this age he had his first awareness that there was a rhythm in the order of things. At age 13 he began attending the Liceo de Varones (Grammar School for Men), where he studied pre-Columbian archaeology and his TaPur√©pechaascan heritage. He excelled in Indian designs and arts, and painted an oil copy of Entombment by Titian. When his biological mother died at age 17, he was fostered and taken in by an aristocratic woman named Rosalia LaBastida de Coney (1844-1897), she was married to an American, Alexander K. Coney (1847-1930) who worked for Mexico's foreign office. When Alexander Coney was appointed Consul-General of Mexico and posted to in San Francisco in 1886, Martinez followed them, sailing through the Golden Gate in 1893. Upon arrival in San Francisco, in 1893 Martinez enrolled in the California School of Design, also known as the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art or San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI). In 1895 he received the school's Avery Golden Medal in painting and an honorable mention in drawing. He graduated in 1897, worked briefly as assistant to the head of the Institute, Arthur Frank Mathews, and became a member of the Bohemian Club. Martinez entered the Paris √âcole des Beaux Arts, Atelier G√©rome in 1897. In 1898 he sent a number of paintings of Paris scenes back to the Bohemian Club for an exhibition in San Francisco. He enjoyed the company of Henri Matisse and graduated from the √âcole in 1899. In 1900 he entered the Academy of Eug√®ne Carri√®re and his Portrait of Miss Marion Holden - a Tonalist work similar to Whistler's Mother - won an honorable mention in the Mexican display at the Paris International Exposition. Return to San Francisco, Mexico trips In 1901 he moved back to San Francisco, he shared an art studio with Gottardo Piazzoni and that year became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He advertised as a portrait painter, but also continued to paint tonalist landscapes. In the subsequent year he helped found the California Society of Artists with Piazzoni, Maynard Dixon, Charles Peter Neilson and other artists who were disaffected with the San Francisco Art Association. Their first and only exhibition included seventeen works by Martinez, mostly French scenes. In 1904 he began sharing his Montgomery Street atelier with Maynard Dixon; they held joint studio shows on Saturdays. The two travelled to Arizona and Tepic, Mexico, in April 1905; upon their return Martinez held several exhibitions. Afternoon in Piedmont (Elsie Whitaker Martinez), ca. 1908In 1905 he spent two months in Guadalajara with Maynard Dixon. Upon his return to San Francisco he held a number of exhibitions, and also gave one show in New York, emphasizing the recent Mexican genre paintings. That year he produced a painting a critic called a \\"masterpiece,\\" given the title The Prayer of the Earth by his poet friend George Sterling.San Francisco Call, 30 July 1905, p. 19  Personal life  After the earthquake of 1906 he moved across the bay to Piedmont, California, and met Elsie Whitaker, 20 years his junior, the daughter of the writer Herman Whitaker. On October 17, 1907, he married Elsie Whitaker in Oakland. After their honeymoon in Carmel-by-the-Sea they commenced building a studio in Piedmont. During the summers of 1909 to 1914, they rented a house in Carmel so that Mart√≠nez could teach art classes at the Hotel Del Monte. The Mart√≠nezes had a daughter on August 13, 1913: Micaela Martinez. She became a fine artist, studying painting with Victor Arnautoff and sculpture with Ralph Stackpole; she later studied stone cutting with Ruth Cravath. In 1944 she married artist Ralph DuCasse and changed her name to Micaela Martinez DuCasse. In 1923, Elsie and Xavier Martinez separated. Art and teaching career Martinez was one of a group of artists invited to create an art gallery at Monterey's Hotel Del Monte in 1907.The Argonaut (San Francisco, CA): 16 February 1907, p. 463; 27 April 1907, p. 633. He began teaching as a substitute drawing teacher in June 1909 at the California School of Arts and Crafts (CSAC) in Berkeley.The Courier (Berkeley, CA): 24 April 1909, p. 9; 26 June 1909, p. 14. By August he was appointed a permanent member of the faculty with the title \\"Instructor for Still Life and Landscape Painting in Oil.\\" He published several articles on art history in the CSAC Alumni Magazine. He exhibited with members of the Berkeley art colony between 1906 and 1911. He taught at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco from 1916 to 1917, but his contract was not renewed because the conservative director of that school, Pedro Joseph de Lemos, objected to Martinez's \\"flamboyant attire and socialist-inspired commentaries.\\" Martinez continued to teach at the CSAC and moved in 1924 to its new Oakland campus where three years later he was appointed a \\"Professor of Painting.\\" He officially retired in September 1942. The School was renamed the California College of the Arts (CCA) in 2003. He taught summer classes in the Monterey area from 1910 to 1914. From 1915 through the late 1920s he instructed his summer classes from his Piedmont studio-home.American Art Annual, 18, 1921, p. 189. In 1912 he helped found the California Society of Etchers; then, the following year he was elected to the National Geographic Society and given a key to the Capitol Club in Monterey. Also in 1913 he made a painting trip to the Arizona desert with Francis McComas (painter), which abruptly ended with much animosity and negative publicity in the press.The Oakland Tribune, 30 March 1913, p. 25.San Francisco Examiner, 21 December 1913, p. 37. In 1914, Impressionists Childe Hassam and Edward Simmons came to Piedmont to view Martinez' desert paintings. The following year he exhibited at the Panama Pacific International Exhibition (where he won honorable mention) and at the Golden Gate Park Museum in San Francisco. Throughout this period he had shows in New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Noted paintings of this period are Head of a Girl, The Storm, Piedmont Hills and Lake Merritt. Between 1916 and 1920 he had numerous exhibitions including at the Palace of Fine Arts, The San Francisco Art Association and the Hotel Oakland. Martinez became a member of the American Federation of Arts in 1921. In subsequent years he continued to exhibit, but was increasingly called upon to be a juror of other artists' works. In 1935 he showed The Green Moon at the San Francisco Museum of Art. In 1939 he exhibited Portrait of Elsie at the 1939-1940 Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE), on Treasure Island. Martinez was selected in 1940 to represent California in the Hall of Fame at the World's Fair of 1940 in New York as one of three (along with Father Junipero Serra and William Keith). Writings During the last two decades of his life, Martinez became increasingly interested in his indigenous Mexican heritage. He published poetry and philosophic writings in a column entitled \\"Notas de un Chichimeca\\" in the Hispano-Americano, San Francisco's Spanish- language newspaper.A History of Mexican Americans in California: Historic Sites/Martinez House, Oakland In 1935 his article Aztecas‚ÄîNaluatlecas or Mexicas appeared in California Arts and Architecture.

Essentially a larger-boot version of the Mk VI, the R type is regarded by some as a stop-gap before the introduction of the S series cars in 1955. As with its predecessor, a standard body was available as well as coachbuilt versions by firms including H. J. Mulliner & Co., Park Ward, Harold Radford, Freestone and Webb, Carrosserie Worblaufen and others. Other than the radiator grilles and the carburation there was little difference between the standard Bentley R Type and the Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn. The R Type was the more popular marque, with some 2,500 units manufactured during its run to the Silver Dawn's 760. Design During development it was referred to as the Bentley Mark VII; the chassis cards for these cars describe them as Bentley 7. The R Type name which is now usually applied stems from chassis series RT. The front of the saloon model was identical to the Mark VI, but the boot (trunk) was almost doubled in capacity. The engine displacement was approximately 4¬Ω litres, as fitted to later versions of the Mark VI. An automatic choke was fitted to the R-type's carburettor. The attachment of the rear springs to the chassis was altered in detail between the Mark VI and the R Type. For buyers looking for a more distinctive car, a decreasing number had custom coachwork available from the dwindling number of UK coachbuilders. These ranged from the grand flowing lines of Freestone and Webb's conservative, almost prewar shapes, to the practical conversions of Harold Radford which including a clamshell style tailgate and folding rear seats. =Running gear= All R Type models use an iron-block/aluminium-head straight-six engine fed by twin SU Type H6 carburettors. The basic engine displaced with a bore and stroke. A four-speed manual transmission was standard with a four-speed automatic option becoming standard on later cars. As of 2017, it remains the last car by Bentley to be sold with a manual transmission. =Brakes and suspension= The suspension was independent at the front using coil springs with semi elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The brakes used drums all round and were operated hydraulically at the front and mechanically at the rear via a gearbox driven servo. =Coachbuilt examples= The first example is the standard steel saloon built by Bentley, but a number of customers opted for a bare chassis which was taken to a coachbuilder of their choice.

Mulliner Interior of red Continental coup√© by H. J. Mulliner above The R-Type Continental was a high- performance version of the R-Type. It was the fastest four-seat car in production at the time. The prototype was developed by a team of designers and engineers from Rolls-Royce Ltd. and coachbuilder H. J. Mulliner & Co. led by Rolls-Royce's Chief Project Engineer, Ivan Evernden. Rolls-Royce worked with H. J. Mulliner instead of their own coachbuilding subsidiary Park Ward because the former had developed a lightweight body construction system using metal throughout instead of the traditional ash-framed bodies. The styling, finalised by Stanley Watts of H. J. Mulliner, was influenced by aerodynamic testing conducted at Rolls-Royce's wind tunnel by Evernden's assistant, Milford Read. The rear fins stabilised the car at speed and made it resistant to changes in direction due to crosswinds. A maximum kerb weight of was specified to keep the tyres within a safe load limit at a top speed of . The prototype, with chassis number 9-B-VI and registration number OLG-490, which earned it the nickname \\"Olga\\", was on the road by August 1951. Olga and the first series of production Continentals were based on the Mark VI chassis, and used a manual mixture control on the steering wheel boss, as these versions did not have an automatic choke. The early R Type Continental has essentially the same engine as the standard R Type, but with modified carburation, induction and exhaust manifolds along with higher gear ratios. The compression ratio was raised to 7.25:1 from the standard 6.75:1, while the final gear ratio was raised (lowered numerically) from 3.41 to 3.07. Continental coup√© by Park Ward Despite its name, the two-door Continental was produced principally for the domestic home market, most of the 207 cars produced were right-hand drive, with 43 left-hand drive examples produced for use abroad. The chassis was produced at the Rolls-Royce Crewe factory and shared many components with the standard R type. R-Type Continentals were delivered as rolling chassis to the coachbuilder of choice. Coachwork for most of these cars was completed by H. J. Mulliner & Co. who mainly built them in fastback coupe form. Other coachwork came from Park Ward (London) who built six, later including a drophead coupe version. Franay (Paris) built five, Graber (Wichtrach, Switzerland) built three, one of them later altered by K√∂ng (Basel, Switzerland), and Pininfarina made one. James Young (London) built in 1954 a Sports Saloon for the owner of the company, James Barclay. Continental drophead coup√© by Park Ward After July 1954, the car was fitted with an engine with a larger bore of 94.62 mm (3.7 in), giving a total displacement of 4.9 L (4887 cc/298 in¬≥). The rarity of the R Type Continental has made the car valuable to car collectors. In 2015 a 1952 R Type Continental, in unrestored condition, sold for over US$1 million.

S3 Continental Continental Flying Spur by Mulliner Park Ward S3 Continental Flying Spur by HJ Mulliner In 1959, Rolls-Royce acquired H. J. Mulliner & Co., coachbuilders (HJM). In 1961, HJM was merged with Park Ward, which had been in the possession of Rolls-Royce since 1939, to form Mulliner, Park Ward Ltd. (MPW). When production of the S3 Continentals commenced there were more differences than the adaption of the previous HJM design by Mulliner Park Ward: The cars were built at the former Park Ward premises in Willesden, North London. The HJM facilities were abandoned. The S3 Continental was strictly coachbuilt. Most bodies were of the altered HJM style, available in fixed head or drop head coupe form. Of the 328 coachbuilt S3 (Continentals included here), nearly 100 were by MPW. Again, fixed head or a drop head coupe configurations were available. The most prominent visual difference from the S2 configuration was the four canted headlights. For the first time, this body was offered on the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud, as well as the S3 chassis. The final S3 was delivered in 1966, when the new Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow and Bentley T-series were readily available. Like earlier Continentals, the sportier S3 bodywork was manufactured entirely from aluminum, unlike the heavier, steel bodied S3 saloon. This, combined with higher gearing and the better compression ratios made for a markedly faster car. Four-doored Continentals bodied by H. J. Mulliner were known as the \\"Flying Spur\\", although four-door Continentals by other coachbuilders are sometimes erroneously referred to as \\"Flying Spurs\\" as well; the term only correctly refers to Mulliner's versions. Another elegant four-door saloon for the S3 Continental came from James Young). Despite being highly desirable the extremely expensive Continentals (a premium of 40-50% over the very expensive S3) sold in much smaller quantities than the S3 saloon by a factor of four.The Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts' Club - RREC - for Bentley and Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts Production * Bentley S3 Continental: 311 (291 by Mulliner Park Ward and 20 by James Young) SC06 1962 Bentley S2 Continental Flying Spur.jpgFlying Spur by Mulliner Park Ward Bentley S3 Continental Flying Spur by HJ Mulliner ‚Äì Innenraum, 10.

The \\"R\\" stood for \\"roadholding\\", to set it apart from its predecessor. It initially inherited the turbocharged engine from the Mulsanne Turbo and also sported a retuned suspension and wider tires on alloy wheels, a first for a Bentley. From the 1987 model year (20,000 series chassis numbers), however, the Turbo R's V8 engine was retuned with fuel injection for added torque. Motor Trend called the Turbo R \\"the first Bentley in decades deserving of the famous name\\" in their review of the car on its introduction to the United States in 1989. History Bentley Turbo R Interior The suspension changes, though seemingly subtle, transformed the soft and less than well-controlled ride of the Mulsanne Turbo into that of a real performer.Wood, p. 142 Development on improving handling had already begun when Mike Dunn was appointed engineering director in Crewe in February 1983, but instead of the proposed 10% increase in roll stiffness, he demanded 50%. This goal was met by upping the anti-roll bar rates by 100% in front and 60% in the rear, and by increasing the damping. A Panhard rod to anchor the rear sub-frame was also introduced, reducing side-to-side movement in corners. Spring rates remained the same as on the Mulsanne. Although official figures were never provided by Rolls-Royce, Motor Trend estimated power output at with of torque. Priced at US$195,000 in the US market, the Turbo R slotted above the Bentley Mulsanne S and Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit but $39,000 below the Rolls-Royce Silver Spur. Bentley Turbo R, rear view The Turbo R was sold alongside the Mulsanne Turbo for a brief moment, but the Mulsanne was taken out of production in 1985. In October 1986, for the 1987 model year, the Turbo R received anti-lock brakes and new Bosch MK-Motronic fuel injection to replace the Solex carburetors. Other modifications carried out at the same time included new, slimmer sports seats and a higher rear axle ratio. In mid-1988 (MY 1989) changes to the appearance were made, introducing twin round headlamps and a bigger front spoiler.Wood, p. 143 Around the turn of the year between 1991 and 1992, GM's 4L80-E four-speed automatic transmission replaced the long running three-speed Turbo Hydramatic 400 throughout the Bentley/Rolls-Royce lineup, including the Turbo R.Wood, p. 144 =New Turbo R= A \\"New\\" Turbo R model was introduced in 1995 for the 1996 model year. Changes included Zytek fuel injection and appearance modifications. There was also a special version for the German market, the \\"Turbo R Sport\\", which featured the Continental T's sporty alloys and carbon-fibre, rather than walnut, panels inside.Wood, p. 146 =Turbo S= In 1995, the Bentley Turbo S was announced as a strictly limited model, with envisaged production as less than 100 units. Effectively a stop-gap model before the introduction of the Bentley Arnage, just 60 units were produced making it the rarest of the Bentley SZ Series of cars, distributed across selected European, Middle Eastern and Asian markets and customers only. The engine termed a Blackpool version used Bosch Motronic fuel injection and digital ignition derived from Formula 1 technology, and with a larger exhaust driven Garrett AirResearch turbocharger with intercooler. It had a power output of . The same engine was fitted to 12 Bentley Continental S, and 3 to special build Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit S. The car was fitted with a viscous differential, and with both new 255/55WR17 tyres and traction control fitted, permitted a top speed of .Wood, p. 145 In 1996 production of the short wheelbase Turbo R ended, leaving only the model hitherto sold as the Turbo RL - now known simply as the Turbo R. For 1998, the Turbo R was replaced by the sportier yet Turbo RT. Turbo RT Bentley Turbo RT The Bentley Turbo RT was the last and most expensive of the Turbo R line. The Bentley RT came with a 6.75 L V8 engine, as used in the Continental T, which is boosted by a single Garrett AiResearch T04 turbocharger and has a Zytek EMS3 engine management system, developed from Formula 1 racing technology, differing from earlier models with the 'Motronic' system. It is visually differentiated from other Bentley Turbo R models by its sport wheels, radiator mesh grille and colour-coded bumpers with bright mesh inserts. Performance was sufficient: with a top speed limited to , the ultra- luxurious Turbo RT was as fast as the sporting German luxury saloons of the time. The car's base price was US$ 211,600, or roughly US$65,000 more than the Turbo R. The Turbo RT was produced during 1997 and 1998 only, with 252 units produced. It was essentially a \\"runout special\\", an effort to sell off the last Mulsanne style bodies before the introduction of the Arnage. A few even rarer editions of the RT were made: The Bentley Turbo RT Olympian: in 1998, London dealer Jack Barclay agreed to have a small number of cars built to incorporate many special features. These are probably the rarest version of the RT- although not officially recognised as such, therefore the RT Mulliner commands a much higher premium. These were sold as the Bentley Turbo RT Olympian. They can be identified by the five-spoke alloy wheels (borrowed from the 'Mulliner' version) and the \\"Olympian\\" boot badge. It is estimated that only four examples of this version were ever built. A rare 1998 Bentley Turbo RT Mulliner The Bentley Turbo RT Mulliner: The Mulliner version, available only by special order for the 1998 model year, was even more exclusive and expensive.Wood, p. 147 It boasts a engine with a torque output of 634 lbft (861 Nm): this was achieved by developing a new compressor for the turbocharger, remapped engine management system, and modifications to the air intake system. Visually, Mulliners have more aerodynamic, rounded bumpers with prominent venting and often foglamps, as well as flared fenders to accommodate a wider track and larger 18-inch alloy wheels, sitting on low-profile 255/55 tires. Each car was built to individual specifications, with many sporting side and bonnet vents and also the smaller Mulliner rear windscreen. One popular feature in Mulliners is a prominent speedometer for the rear passengers. Just 56 Mulliner editions were built, of which 17 are right-hand drive. Seven of the Mulliner editions built are to standard wheelbase specifications, and 49 are on the lengthened wheelbase.

In 2001, an international group of activists organizing a conference to raise awareness around climate change squatted the former leper hospital, which had been abandoned for some 53 years. The squat became famous in 2002, when squatters in lockons and on tripods nonviolently resisted an eviction. During a three-day standoff, police were unable to remove the squatters, resulting in the case returning to the courts. After three years, the case was won by the owners, but no eviction notice has since been issued. On most Sundays from late September to early June there is an open house and guided tour in which residents explain community living, consensus-based decision-making, ecological gardening and living, and the functioning of the social center. There is a collective meal and from 100 to 300 people come up to participate in free activities related to ecology, activism, and self-sufficiency.  The name Can Masdeu  Can means \\"property of\\" and \\"Masdeu\\" comes from the Masdeu family who once inhabited the farmhouse at the center of the valley. Thus, Can Masdeu can refer to any of the following: * the masia - a traditional Iberian patriarchal mansion or plantation house * the valley, or the community gardens which inhabit it * the community of squatters * the social center or the ecological project associated with it. * the nunnery or leper hospital which once inhabited the masia and the valley.  Grounds, location and early history  The grounds governed by the squat include almost a hectare of land in use as gardens, an abandoned nunnery and hospital facility and about of mostly hilly forests. The building spans four floors and is draped over the side of a hill. It includes 24 different rooms of various sizes including a large hall. Can Masdeu is located up the hill from the Canyelles L3 Metro station in Barcelona. There is a sign for it before the walk up a dirt road to the site. The building was built on an ancient Roman site, and was surrounded by vineyards before the city expanded into Nou Barris. Of the existing structure, first the temple (masia) was completed in the 17th century. In the early 20th century the living units, common space and kitchen were added. After functioning as a nunnery for some years, the facility was converted into a leper hospital. It was ultimately shuttered and abandoned in 1948. Fear of leprosy may have been a factor in this large facility being left vacant for over half a century.  Occupation and legal status  Two squatters balance on a \\"death plank\\" to resist the police eviction An international group of activists spent over a year searching in Barcelona for the best location to occupy and in December 2001 they moved onto the abandoned hospital. The aim was to hold a conference to raise awareness around climate change. Can Masdeu became famous in April 2002, when over 100 national police came to evict 11 squatters. Using passive resistance over three days the squatters were able to hold off the police's efforts at forced removal. The squatters used a number of techniques to retain control of the space including, significantly, locking themselves to various precarious perches outside the building. This created a situation in which the police risked serious injury to themselves or to squatters in attempting to remove them. Some dangling occupiers locked themselves to the building, others balanced on a long seesaw, from which no single occupant could be removed without dropping the other. Many were suspended outside the building on frames and even a bathtub was used. The police changed their initial strategy of forced removal with one of waiting for the squatters to get thirsty and hungry and come down. They waited for three days with growing local support and media attention. Hundreds of spectators came to see the occupation, many of them chanted slogans, and stopped traffic on the local highway. A Dutch solidarity organization organized an occupation of the Spanish Embassy in the Netherlands. After three days, the Barcelona judge overseeing the case ordered the police to withdraw. The judge's ruling specified that human rights and safety are more important than property rights. Gadjo playing at the Can Masdeu Cal√ßotada - Spring 2007 There have been both civil and criminal cases brought against the occupants of Can Masdeu since 2002. Most of these cases have been lost by the community, but it continues to occupy the site, in part because the hospital that owns the facility does not have the financial capacity to renovate the structure. Further complicating the hospital's plans to provide a suitable reason for improving the Can Masdeu site is the fact that immediately next to it there is another larger abandoned institutional building, which could more easily be used than the more dilapidated older facility.  Local relations  Relations with the surrounding local population has been a focus of the efforts of the residents of Can Masdeu. Immediately after the occupation, the community encouraged local gardeners to come plant on their gardens on the grounds. About a dozen people at first, mostly older women responded to the offer and began planting mostly produce and some flowers. The Community Gardeners share duties, resources, and have parties together with live-in members of the community The community hosts monthly or bi-monthly potlucks with local gardeners and there are regular meetings to manage the affairs of the garden. In 2006 a large second terrace of gardens was recovered from the surround bush lands and additional local gardens were planted. There are three tiers of gardens, the lowest is the new local gardens, the middle tier is production garden for the community and the top tier is the original local gardens. These neighbors initially came from the Nou Barris district, but increasingly locals involved with these community gardens who move to nearby locations continue to come to this site and maintain their plots.  Social centre activities  For most Sundays from late September to early June there are public workshops offered in the social centre, the PIC, or Punt d'Interracci√≥ de Collserola. These workshops and presentations cover a variety of topics including: * environmental issues * permaculture and organic farming * communities movement * political resistance * independent film presentations * music, dancing and cultural expression * walking tours of the community grounds and building An organic vegetarian meal served for around 5 euros.as of spring 2017, the stated policy was that people can also have for free or for exchange, and the suggested donation is from 4,50 to 5,50 depending on whether some or all of the ingredients are organic, the meal is more elaborate, etc. from a Can Masdeu internal document. The Social Centre and the 'Rurbar', a cafe serving local and organic meals and drinks, is open most Sundays from noon until evening. Activities are listed on the website, on the Facebook page, and in the Infousurpa newsletter.  Renovations and functions  Solar energy is used to the maximum Lunch and dinner is communal. A substantial renovation was necessary to make the space livable. Squatters cleared out rooms and repaired them and moved on to the adjacent space for a period of over 3 years. Residents enjoy a low energy, low impact lifestyle with few low power electrical fixtures and a couple of woodstoves for the sprawling complex. The community runs a bike shop and repair clinic, bakes bread for itself and local customers, provides space to the local high school for meetings and performances, and it also hosts meeting of progressive and resistance groups.  Current status  , 24 adults and 5 children live in and share the house. Community participation includes bi-weekly meetings, organic gardening, housework, and two collective meals per day, and each member contributes 100 euros/month to general costs. Many members work outside of the house, though there are cottage industries such as beer, floor chairs, herbal remedies, or organic catering. The working languages of the house are Catalan and Spanish, but as it is an international group, English, Italian, French, Basque, and Esperanto are also spoken. The community hosts some guests who are either friends of the community or involved in service projects or movements that the community supports. The community receives far more requests to host people than it has the capacity to provide. Unlike most squats and even intentional communities, Can Masdeu has quite low turn-over, with around one person leaving per year from 2013-2018.

Exfoliation joints in granite at Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, Texas, USA. Detached blocks have slid along the steeply-dipping joint plane. Exfoliation joints or sheet joints are surface-parallel fracture systems in rock, and often leading to erosion of concentric slabs. (See Joint (geology)).  General characteristics of exfoliation joints  * Commonly follow topography. * Divide the rock into sub-planar slabs. * Joint spacing increases with depth from a few centimeters near the surface to a few meters * Maximum depth of observed occurrence is around 100 meters. * Deeper joints have a larger radius of curvature, which tends to round the corners of the landscape as material is eroded * Fracture mode is tensile * Occur in many different lithologies and climate zones, not unique to glaciated landscapes. * Host rock is generally sparsely jointed, fairly isotropic, and has high compressive strength. * Can have concave and convex upwards curvatures. * Often associated with secondary compressive forms such as arching, buckling, and A-tents (buckled slabs)  Formation of exfoliation joints  Despite their common occurrence in many different landscapes, geologists have yet to reach an agreement on a general theory of exfoliation joint formation. Many different theories have been suggested, below is a short overview of the most common. = Removal of overburden and rebound = Exfoliation joints exposed in a road cut in Yosemite National Park, California. This theory was originally proposed by the pioneering geomorphologist Grove Karl Gilbert in 1904. The basis of this theory is that erosion of overburden and exhumation of deeply buried rock to the ground surface allows previously compressed rock to expand radially, creating tensile stress and fracturing the rock in layers parallel to the ground surface. The description of this mechanism has led to alternate terms for exfoliation joints, including pressure release or offloading joints. Though the logic of this theory is appealing, there are many inconsistencies with field and laboratory observations suggesting that it may be incomplete, such as: * Exfoliation joints can be found in rocks that have never been deeply buried. * Laboratory studies show that simple compression and relaxation of rock samples under realistic conditions does not cause fracturing. * Exfoliation joints are most commonly found in regions of surface-parallel compressive stress, whereas this theory calls for them to occur in zones of extension. One possible extension of this theory to match with the compressive stress theory (outlined below) is as follows (Goodman, 1989): The exhumation of deeply buried rocks relieves vertical stress, but horizontal stresses can remain in a competent rock mass since the medium is laterally confined. Horizontal stresses become aligned with the current ground surface as the vertical stress drops to zero at this boundary. Thus large surface-parallel compressive stresses can be generated through exhumation that may lead to tensile rock fracture as described below. = Thermoelastic strain = Rock expands upon heating and contracts upon cooling and different rock- forming minerals have variable rates of thermal expansion / contraction. Daily rock surface temperature variations can be quite large, and many have suggested that stresses created during heating cause the near-surface zone of rock to expand and detach in thin slabs (e.g. Wolters, 1969). Large diurnal or fire-induced temperature fluctuations have been observed to create thin lamination and flaking at the surface of rocks, sometimes labeled exfoliation. However, since diurnal temperature fluctuations only reach a few centimeters depth in rock (due to rock's low thermal conductivity), this theory cannot account for the observed depth of exfoliation jointing that may reach 100 meters. = Chemical weathering = Mineral weathering by penetrating water can cause flaking of thin shells of rock since the volume of some minerals increases upon hydration. However, not all mineral hydration results in increased volume, while field observations of exfoliation joints show that the joint surfaces have not experienced significant chemical alteration, so this theory can be rejected as an explanation for the origin of large-scale, deeper exfoliation joints. = Compressive stress and extensional fracture = Exfoliation joints have modified the near-surface portions of massive granitic rocks in Yosemite National Park, helping create the many spectacular domes, including Half Dome shown here. Large compressive tectonic stresses parallel to the land (or a free) surface can create tensile mode fractures in rock, where the direction of fracture propagation is parallel to the greatest principle compressive stress and the direction of fracture opening is perpendicular to the free surface. This type of fracturing has been observed in the laboratory since at least 1900 (in both uniaxial and biaxial unconfined compressive loading; see Gramberg, 1989). Tensile cracks can form in a compressive stress field due to the influence of pervasive microcracks in the rock lattice and extension of so-called wing cracks from near the tips of preferentially oriented microcracks, which then curve and align with the direction of the principle compressive stress. Fractures formed in this way are sometimes called axial cleavage, longitudinal splitting, or extensional fractures, and are commonly observed in the laboratory during uniaxial compression tests. High horizontal or surface-parallel compressive stress can result from regional tectonic or topographic stresses, or by erosion or excavation of overburden. With consideration of the field evidence and observations of occurrence, fracture mode, and secondary forms, high surface- parallel compressive stresses and extensional fracturing (axial cleavage) seems to be the most plausible theory explaining the formation of exfoliation joints.  Engineering geology significance  Recognizing the presence of exfoliation joints can have important implications in geological engineering. Most notable may be their influence on slope stability. Exfoliation joints following the topography of inclined valley walls, bedrock hill slopes, and cliffs can create rock blocks that are particularly prone to sliding. Especially when the toe of the slope is undercut (naturally or by human activity), sliding along exfoliation joint planes is likely if the joint dip exceeds the joint's frictional angle. Foundation work may also be affected by the presence of exfoliation joints, for example in the case of dams. Exfoliation joints underlying a dam foundation can create a significant leakage hazard, while increased water pressure in joints may result in lifting or sliding of the dam. Finally, exfoliation joints can exert strong directional control on groundwater flow and contaminant transport.

She is considered to have been the greatest woman poet of the Italian Renaissance, and she is regarded by many as the greatest Italian woman poet of any age. Biography Portrait of Gaspara Stampa, 1738, by Daniel Antonio Bertoli/Felicitas Sartori. Achille Bertarelli Print Collection, Castello Sforzesco, Milan. Stampa's father, Bartolomeo, originally from Milan, was a jewel and gold merchant in Padua, where she was born, along with her siblings Cassandra and Baldassarre. When Gaspara was eight, her father died and her mother, Cecilia, moved to Venice with her children, whom she educated in literature, music, history, and painting. Gaspara and Cassandra excelled at singing and playing the lute, possibly due to training by Tuttovale Menon. Early on, the Stampa household became a literary club, visited by many well-known Venetian writers, painters and musicians. There is evidence that Gaspara herself was a musician who performed madrigals of her own composition. When her brother died in 1544, Stampa suffered greatly and formed the intention of becoming a nun. However, after a long period of crisis, she came back to \\"la dolce vita\\" (the sweet life) in Venice. In 1550, Stampa became a member of the Accademia dei Dubbiosi under the name of \\"Anaxilla.\\" At this time, she began a love affair with Count Collaltino di Collalto. It was to him that she eventually dedicated most of the 311 poems she is known to have written. The count's interest apparently cooled, perhaps in part due to his many voyages out of Venice. The relationship broke off in 1551. Stampa went into a physical prostration and depression, but the result of this period is a collection of beautiful, intelligent and assertive poems in which she triumphs over Collaltino, creating for herself a lasting reputation. (Collaltino, meanwhile, is only remembered because of Stampa.) She makes clear in her poems that she uses her pain to inspire the poetry, hence her survival and fame. Between 1551 and 1552, Stampa enjoyed a period of relative tranquility; she began a new relationship with Bartolomeo Zen. During 1553 and 1554, suffering poor health, she spent a few months in Florence, hoping that the milder climate might cure her. She returned to Venice, but became ill with a high fever, and after fifteen days she died on April 23, 1554. The parish register where she lived in Venice records her cause of death as fever, colic and mal de mare (Venetian for \\"disease of the sea\\"). Literature The first page of Gaspara Stampa's Rime, 1554 The first edition of Gaspara Stampa's poetry, Rime di Madonna Gaspara Stampa, was published posthumously in October 1554 by Venetian printer Plinio Pietrasanta. The collection was edited by her sister Cassandra. It was dedicated to Giovanni Della Casa. Stampa's collection of poems has a diary form: Gaspara expresses happiness and emotional distress, and her 311 poems are one of the most important collections of female poetry of the 16th century. The German poet, Rainer Maria Rilke, refers to Gaspara Stampa in the first of his Duino Elegies; which is often considered his greatest work.

It is owned by Steel City Media and airs a country music radio format. The studios and offices are on Pennsylvania Avenue at Westport Center in Midtown Kansas City, Missouri. KFKF-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts. The transmitter site is off East 63rd Street in Kansas City, Missouri, near Interstate 435. KFKF-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. History =Early years as KCKN-FM= The station has been playing country music since it signed on the air on May 23, 1963. KCKN-FM was a simulcast of its AM counterpart, 1340 KCKN (now KDTD). The two stations were owned by Cy Blumenthal and the call sign represented Kansas City, KaNsas. KCKN-FM was originally powered at 20,000 watts. In 1965, KCKN-AM-FM was acquired by Kaye-Smith Broadcasting, which owned a number of stations in sizable markets, mostly in the West. By the 1970s, KCKN-FM's power was boosted to the current 100,000 watts, but the tower was only 460 feet tall, less than half its current height. =Switch to KFKF-FM= The simulcast ended in 1982, when the AM station became KRKR, a mostly automated album rock station, while the FM station adopted the current KFKF-FM call letters. At first, it was Kansas City's only full-powered FM country station, though they would be in heavy competition with 610 WDAF's personality country format, which remained the top rated country outlet, years after many other AM country stations around the U.S. had switched formats. Sconnix Broadcasting acquired KFKF in 1990. In 1993, KFKF got an FM competitor, when KBEQ-FM switched from Top 40 hits to a younger-targeting country format. =Changes in ownership= EZ Communications bought KFKF in 1995, then American Radio Systems in April 1997, and then Westinghouse/CBS in September.https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive- BC-YB/1996/1996-BC-YB.pdfhttps://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- YB/1998/1998-BC-YB.pdf https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-09-26.pdf In June 1998, CBS split off the radio division under the revived Infinity Broadcasting name, which would be renamed CBS Radio in December 2005. In November 2006, Wilks Broadcasting purchased the station from CBS. Upon taking over the station, Wilks cut many long time staffers, including midday DJ Rusty Walker, night DJ Tim Peters, morning newscaster Randy Birch, and overnight host Joy. Under Infinity ownership, KFKF became co-owned with its chief FM country competitor, KBEQ. KBEQ continued to aim at younger country fans, while KFKF appealed to more middle-aged listeners. In 2003, WDAF switched from AM 610 to FM 106.5, as the AM frequency flipped to sports talk as KCSP. The move gave Kansas City three country music stations on FM. In 2011, with the market not having any adult contemporary stations airing full-time Christmas music (sister station KCKC flipped to album adult alternative, and KUDL flipped to a simulcast of KMBZ), Wilks announced that the station, for the first time in its history, would air round-the-clock Christmas music beginning November 25, 2011. The station started playing Christmas music again beginning November 20, 2012. However, when KCKC reverted to AC (and resumed their tradition of airing Christmas music during the holiday season) in 2014, KFKF stopped airing Christmas music.

He had eleven children, the 4th one of them called Sigismondo Quirino. Obviously he was close to the House of Este, rulers of Modena and Ferrara, and to Count Boiardo of Scandiano, who gave him hospitality in 1543. He was also property owner in Correggio's land. In 1548 he was certainly in Ferrara, at the court of Renate of France, and he lived there for a short time. In 1550 he was in Cambrai, France, returning to Correggio two years later. One year later, he was in Ferrara again, where he died probably in 1567.

It allows archaeologists to make inferences in the other direction: from archaeological finds in the present to behaviours in the past. Middle range theories are derived from ethnoarchaeology and experimental research in combination with the study of taphonomic processes. Background and application The term was adapted by Lewis Binford. He conducted ethnographic fieldwork amongst modern hunter-gatherer peoples such as the Nunamiut Eskimo, the Navajo, and Australian Aborigines in order to understand the pattern of waste their activities generated. He then used this data to infer the behaviour of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers from the waste they left in the archaeological record. Binford and many of his contemporaries viewed the construction of middle-range theories as a fundamental first step in understanding how people in the past behaved. However, middle-range research has since been criticized as logically flawed. Its critics argued that it rested on the unjustified assumption that there is a uniform link between behaviour and physical remains that holds true throughout human history. Its conclusions were argued to be untestable because their application was founded on a tautology: evidence from contemporary peoples (e.g. modern hunter-gatherers) was asserted to be applicable to people in the past (e.g. Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers) because they behaved in a similar way, but that same evidence was used to reconstruct the behaviour of the past people. Middle-range theory The middle-range theory in archaeology is narrowly conceived in current conception and negated in use. Theory building began to gain tract in the late 1970s in the time of New Archaeology and took several years to be a topic of critical interest. The concept is often misunderstood because of the multiplicity of the middle-range theory in another scholarly discipline ‚Äì sociology. It is suggested in this approach that scientific knowledge becomes tied with emerging research studies and in turn into a middle-range abstraction. Binford's structure for middle-range theory consists of four components: 1) documentation of causal relations between relevant dynamics and observable statics; 2) recognition of signature patterns in static remains; 3) inference of past dynamics from observation of signature patterns in archaeological record; and, 4) evaluation of these inferences. In archaeology, Binford's method states that a strong relation to natural science will withstand close evaluation in that the theories and evidence should tie together. The connection between the history of the past and the material remains recovered in the present can be regimented to present the best inference. It's the explanatory element of archaeology though many critique it was being too arbitrary. The validity of the theories are often in question and because archaeology is not an exact science, the theories can not be tested rigorously to prove otherwise. The falls middle-range theory are on par with archaeology and anthropology as a whole because only small segments of people and material can be studied to produce an accurate depiction of past life. A general, global scope isn't possible.

Grebennikov wrote detailed accounts of his experiences flying over the Russian countryside using his levitation device. These flying experiences as well as his reported observations of other paranormal phenomena, usually involving insect nests or parts, appear in his self-published book My World (Moi Mir.

Activity In Krasnoobsk, Grebennikov worked as a junior researcher at the Research Institute of Soil Management and Chemicalization of Agriculture. In 1976, he founded the Museum of Agroecology and Environmental Protection. Although once popular with readers who dreamed of human unpowered flight, Grebennikov's flight and other paranormal claims were promptly rejected by skeptics and scientists outside of the paranormal community as his reports were devoid of conclusive proof or public demonstration. He claimed that his camera shutter was jammed during the flights due to a time-warping force-field generated by the secret \\"geometric\\" power of chitin. Translation posted on KeelyNet.com.

It was created by British programmer Rob Northen after founding his own company Copylock Software. It was used mainly to prevent games from being copied by regular users.  History  In 1984, Rob Northen was hired by Acornsoft to write copy protection routines for their published software, such as the original Elite for the BBC Micro. Northen left the company six months later and started his own company Copylock Software, while still working part-time for Acornsoft to write copy protection routines, file systems and disk utilities. Northen's first copy-protected software under the Copylock name came in 1987 on the Atari ST. The first version of the Copylock software was used to protect those early Commodore Amiga and Atari ST games that had no multi-load, hence had to reside on a single floppy disk. Initially, publishers would send the unprotected master disk to Northen, who would then replace the loader program with his own encrypted loader and ship the protected master disk out for duplication. Following requests from game developers, such as The Bitmap Brothers, who were keen to implement more complex protection checks, Northen wrote subroutines that developers could implement to their own liking. In 1990, he purchased a disk duplicator and used it to create floppies with Copylock serial numbers embedded in them, which he would then send to developers in lieu of the protected master disks, along with the Copylock routines for them to include in their games. This Copylock series could accommodate more recent games with multi-load or spanning across multiple floppies. It also allowed for protection checks to be included at arbitrary points in the game code: one example of this was the Hook computer game by Ocean Software, which included an in-game protection check that if failed would cause a key item, namely a mug, to disappear from the game. In 1990, Copylock was also ported to MS-DOS-based systems. By the end of its run in 1996, around 500 commercial Amiga games had reportedly been protected with Copylock.  Technical details  A Copylock-protected floppy disk contains one long track, known as the Copylock Serial Track, which can be read on a standard floppy drive but is impossible to write without a sophisticated disk duplication machine. The disk contains a special loader which is heavily encrypted and can read and decode the Copylock Serial Track. The encrypted code verifies that the disk has the correct Copylock Serial Key, which is uniquely generated for each game. On the machine language level, Copylock works by using the Motorola 68000 trace mode, which causes the processor to execute a specific trace vector before each instruction in the main program. The trace vector decodes the machine language code just-in-time before it is executed and re-encrypts it after execution, so that no more than one or two instructions are stored unencrypted into physical memory at any given time. This is called a trace vector decoder and was originally implemented on the Atari ST platform and afterwards copied to early Amiga models, both based on the 68000 architecture. = First series = There were two types of Copylock routine of the earlier series. In the internal type, the Copylock Serial Key for that particular software is passed in hardware register D0 and stored at memory address $24. Inventive programmers could use this serial key for specific purposes to force the would-be cracker to have to remove the additional checks in the game. However, on many early titles, programmers typically just performed a check for the serial key, which was easy to find in a program and therefore to disable. In the wrapper type, the code to start the game, or boot routine, is encrypted and then included with the Copylock code. All disk validity checking is performed by the Copylock code: if successful, the trace vector decoding extends to the encrypted boot routine or file; the data are then moved to the location expected by the game code and the routine is executed. This type of Series 1 Copylock was often used for games that loaded in one hit and did not need to access the disk drive again. However, this meant that the copy protection was rendered useless once the game was decrypted, as then the game could be 'single-filed', i.e. dumped entirely from memory, saved to disk and then made to work independently of the Copylock routines. = Second series = Series 2 was an evolution of the internal Series 1 routines, which again made early versions easy to circumvent, since many programmers only implemented a simple protection check that read the serial key from the Copylock Serial Track and checked that it was correct. Crackers often did not even need to inspect the encoded Copylock routines, because the check for disk authenticity was implemented in such as way that they could clearly see what the serial key was from the code that checked for it. Therefore, whilst many people understood how Copylock worked, very few had taken the time to work out how to actually decode one. By now, however, Copylock had evolved to allow parameters to be passed to it before execution, which meant that Copylock could now write not only the serial key, but also specific game-related values into the contents of registers passed to Copylock, or simply write values to a list of predefined addresses, which would make the game operate correctly. The typical, generally incorrect way of cracking a Copylocked game was to get the serial key, modify the header of the Copylock to put the correct serial key into register D0, and then bypass all the reading and decoding process. This would mean the \\"special case\\" code in the Copylock would never be executed, which would mean the game would not work by using the serial key alone. = PC version = It was possible to port Copylock to the PC because the x86 microprocessor supports the trace vector the same as the 68000 processor does, through a single-step interrupt or INT 1. It manifested itself in a slightly different way in that the game's executable code was encrypted and \\"wrapped\\" by the Copylock loader. At runtime this loader would read 4 sectors from the floppy, and generate checksums from them. These in turn would be used as the keys to decrypt the game code. Once the decryption was done, the loader transferred control to the game program. The PC version was easy to circumvent, as the original game executable code was just stored inside the loader. Once you got past the disk checks, and encryption code, dumping the unencrypted executable was just a matter of performing 2 disk writes. The first would dump the unmodified \\"MZ\\" header, and the 2nd write would finish the job by saving the actual game code. Fabulous Furlough of The Humble Guys wrote a tool that did just that, and could \\"crack\\" a game in less than a minute.

She was best known for her semi-autobiographical novel L'Astragale. Life and career Born in Algiers, Algeria, she was quickly abandoned and put in the care of the social services, being then christened Albertine Damien in honour of the saint of the day she was found on. She was then adopted by a family that moved her to Aix-en-Provence. Within that dysfunctional family, she was abused by a family member and constantly quarreling with them, which led to an intense distaste for authority that stayed with her the rest of her life. Although she was intelligent and did well in her studies, Albertine's family sent her to a reformatory school in Marseille. She escaped to Paris where she satisfied her thirst for literature and art while she engaged in prostitution. In 1953, a bungled armed hold-up led to her imprisonment within Fresnes Prison. Upon escaping (and breaking her ankle in the process) she met Julien Sarrazin, and the two were soon married. The two continued to live lives of crime, spending time in and out of jail and keeping contact through letters. In prison, Sarrazin wrote her first novels, L'Astragale and La Cavale, which were published after her release in 1964 (the astragale of the title is the French word for the talus bone, which both she and the main character of her novel broke on their escapes from jail). Astragale was translated in English at that same time. Their success allowed the married couple to settle in Montpellier where she wrote her third story, La Traversi√®re. The novel also performed well, but she died shortly afterwards from complications during kidney surgery; she was only 29 years old.

Exfoliation involves the removal of the oldest dead skin cells on the skin's outermost surface. Exfoliation is involved in all facials, during microdermabrasion or chemical peels. Exfoliation can be achieved by mechanical or chemical means. History Credit is given to the ancient Egyptians for the practice of exfoliation. In the Middle Ages, wine was used as a chemical exfoliant, with tartaric acid as the active agent. In Asia, the practice of exfoliation started hundreds of years ago. The etymology of the word \\"exfoliate\\" comes from the Latin exfoliare (to strip off leaves). Types Exfoliation is achieved either by mechanical or by chemical means. = Mechanical = Exfoliation methods used in Canada in 2011. Shown: top right, a bath sponge made of plastic mesh; lower right, a brush with a pumice stone on one side and a natural bristle brush on the other side, for foot exfoliation; lower left, a mud mask package for facial exfoliation; top left, a jar of perfumed body scrub to be used while bathing. This process involves physically scrubbing the skin with an abrasive. Mechanical exfoliants include microfiber cloths, adhesive exfoliation sheets, micro-bead facial scrubs, crepe paper, crushed apricot kernel or almond shells, sugar or salt crystals, pumice, and abrasive materials such as sponges, loofahs, brushes, and simply fingernails. Facial scrubs are available in over-the-counter products for application by the user. People with dry skin should avoid exfoliants which include a significant portion of pumice, or crushed volcanic rock. Pumice is considered a good material to exfoliate the skin of the feet. Microdermabrasion is another mechanical method of exfoliation. = Chemical = Chemical exfoliants include scrubs containing salicylic acid, glycolic acid, fruit enzymes, citric acid, or malic acid which may be applied in high concentrations by a medical professional, or in lower concentrations in over-the-counter products. Chemical exfoliation may involve the use of products that contain alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), or enzymes that act to loosen the glue-like substance that holds the cells together, allowing them to ease away. This type of exfoliation is recommended for people treating acne. In beauty spa treatment in continental Europe, the chemical properties of wine-producing grapes are exploited in the practice of vinotherapy which is becoming increasingly popular. = With hair removal = Some methods of hair removal also exfoliate the skin. *Waxing is a mechanical process performed with the intention of plucking the hair, but it also functions as a mechanical exfoliant. It can be done every two to eight weeks. It is not carried out as frequently as many exfoliate. So, it does not fully substitute for an exfoliation regimen, but may substitute for a normal session in a regimen. *Nair is an example of a chemical hair removal product which also functions as a chemical exfoliant. It is applied more frequently than waxing (once a week rather than once a month) since it only partially destroys hair below the skin, rather than destroying the entire root as with waxing. Using it weekly can substitute for a weekly exfoliant regime. It is a very aggressive chemical and cannot be used on the face, so other exfoliants would need to be used on the face. *Wetshaving also has exfoliating properties: first, the action of moving a shaving brush vigorously across the face washes the face and removes dead skin at the same time. After applying the lather with a brush, the use of a double-edged safety razor or straight razor removes dead skin simply because the razor is dragged much more closely across the skin, and removes dead skin more effectively than a cartridge or electric razor. Dermaplaning Dermaplaning is a medical procedure that exfoliates the skin (or epidermis) by removing dead skin and vellus hair (peach fuzz). The procedure is performed by an aesthetician, who will gently glide a scalpel across the skin, removing the outermost layer of skin cells and hair from the face. As a byproduct, it also shaves off the vellus hair, but the hair will grow back at the same rate and texture as before. The procedure involves the use of a 25-centimetre (10 in) scalpel which curves into a sharp point. In most cases, the blade is used on clean dry skin on the forehead, cheeks, chin, nose and neck. Dermaplaning can also be performed on skin that has had oil applied to it. Promotion In popular media, exfoliants are advertised as treatments which promote beauty, youthful appearance, or health. Disadvantages One disadvantage to exfoliation is the high price of some of the products and methods used to achieve it. Exfoliation will lead to some initial redness to the skin. Near the end of chemical peels, the skin will frost, with colors varying from a bright white to grey on the skin surface. Over-exfoliation can easily leave the skin dry and irritated which is why it is advisable to not exfoliate more than twice a week. = Marine environmental impact of microbeads = Microbead particles used in mechanical exfoliation are too small (less than 1 mm) to be caught by sewage works, so tonnes of microbeads are released into the environment, which damages marine ecosystems. Consequently, in June 2014 the US state of Illinois became the first to ban the use of microbeads, and cosmetics manufacturers such as L'Oreal, Johnson & Johnson, and Colgate agreed to use more natural ingredients.

It began as a father-and-son outing in 1962 before quickly growing into (at one time) the nation's largest bicycle touring weekend. It is non-competitive and has been traditionally held annually on Mother's Day weekend with the exception of its early years and 2017. About 3000 cyclists participate in the annual Mother's Day weekend tour, covering 210 miles during the weekend (105 miles Saturday and 105 miles Sunday). The tour leaves from Columbus, Ohio on Saturday morning, the riders spend the night in Portsmouth on the Ohio River, and return on Sunday to Columbus. TOSRV is organized by Columbus Outdoor Pursuits (COP), an organization with a full range of non- competitive outdoor activities. The tour has become known as America's Bicycle Touring Classic. Since the TOSRV route runs along the Scioto River valley, it avoids the large hills of southern Ohio. The first 50 miles south of Columbus include some slight grades, and from mile 50 to mile 65 there are a series of short, steep hills. The remaining miles to Portsmouth are relatively flat for a total of 105 miles (169 kilometers) for the day. The Tour returns to Columbus along the same route. TOSRV is not for the casual cyclist. To enjoy TOSRV riders should have ridden at least 400 miles during the two months prior to the Tour including at least one 75-mile day. The riders, their bicycles, and equipment must be in top shape. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were around 6000 to 7000 riders who participated in TOSRV. History The tour was started in 1962 by Charles and Greg Siple, a father and son, and grew from there to become one of the largest bicycling tours in America, having 2,672 riders in 2010. The most riders the tour ever hosted was in 1989 with 6,650 riders. A staggered start was necessary beginning in 1973 when the tour reached 2,500 cyclists. People come from all over the nation and Canada to ride TOSRV. Charlie Pace was named director of the tour in 1967 and retired after the 50th anniversary ride in 2011. The tour is now an important part of the culture in Portsmouth, which is known as the city of murals for the colorful depictions of its history on the flood walls. One of the murals is a depiction of the tour. 2017 TOSRV 56 TOSRV56 May 20-21, 2017 #TheMobsRule The Mob won.

Every two miles there is a support team vehicle on the side of the road in case of emergencies such as serious bicycle damage, or injury all day until 9:00 at night when the tour ends. In front of the state building Saturday morning there is a truck to put baggage, sleeping bags and any other materials riders don't want to carry with them on the ride to Portsmouth. Food is provided at the three stops, Circleville, Chillicothe, and Waverly spaced about 25 miles apart. Half TOSRV Less experienced riders or riders who do not like the idea of spending a whole day on a bike can opt for the half TOSRV in which cyclists ride from Chillicothe to Portsmouth on Saturday and return to Chillicothe on Sunday. The half TOSRV riders still receive full support. Overnight accommodation TOSRV registration and hotel accommodation are at the Hyatt on Capital Square in downtown Columbus. The Hyatt allows participants to keep their bikes in their rooms and has discounted rates for the weekend. Once in Portsmouth Saturday night, there are many overnight options. Included in the entry fee is overnight stay in Spartan Stadium camping. An alternative option is the YMCA for $17. All hotels and motels in the area fill up rather quickly around January. Safety In 2008, William Crowley, was killed on Route 23 during the tour. According to State Highway Patrol he was struck from behind by a sport-utility vehicle. The director of the tour said that this is not the designated route, but that some cyclists chose to take it to save some time. However Route 23 is not as safe as Route 104, the designated route. This was the first fatality of the tour in its almost 50-year history. After the incident TOSRV cautioned riders from riding outside the designated route. All participants are required to wear a helmet. Riders of the tour consider the ride to be a safe one. The radio stations in central Ohio and along the tour in Circleville, Chillicothe, Waverly, and Portsmouth all broadcast messages letting drivers know to be alert and courteous of bikers during the weekend. Route The cyclists share the road with drivers for the day. Most of the route is on two-lane country roads. The route is marked with spray paint on the road and with signs at crucial turns. The 2010 tour included an extra 8 miles each way due to a detour since a bridge was closed for repairs. The detour was between the Chillicothe and Waverly stops, which is the longest and hilliest part of the ride.

Duplicate Scrabble In this round, the players had the same seven tiles and had to try to find the best scoring combination possible within 20 seconds (25 seconds in series 2). They inputted their moves with a touch screen and stylus and the tiles would fly out of the podiums onto a giant upright Scrabble board. Contestants scored points for the word they made but only the higher scoring word remained on the board to be played off for the next go. This would be played four or five times. Speed Scrabble The second round was Speed Scrabble. Each player was given a clean board and had just one minute to formulate as many words and score as high as they can. They would take their minutes in turn. Daily Final The winner of the first game would do battle with the winner of the second game in the daily final. This time, the players would be playing Speed Scrabble but sharing the same board. One person would be in control of it for 30 seconds, swapping control after time expires. After two minutes (that's a minute each), the scores would be added to the scores from their earlier rounds to find the day's winner. The four winners from Monday to Thursday programs battled it out on the Friday Final for a shot at Finals Week and a holiday. The last ever episode featured the winner of the remote control interactive winner and the winner of series 3 (Mark Bunce) Problem During a celebrity special in the first series, contestant Mike McClean had problems in the first half as his touch screen was seemingly not functioning properly and ended up scoring only 5 points total in that half. The technical problem was rectified in the second half.

It can be used to hinder reverse engineering when attempting to prevent software cracking as part of an overall copy protection strategy. Microprocessor tracing Certain microprocessor families (e.g. 680x0, x86) provide the capability to trace instructions to aid in program development. A debugger might use this capability to single step through a program, providing the means for a programmer to monitor the execution of the program under test. By installing a custom handler for the trace exception, it is possible to gain control of the machine between the execution of every instruction. A typical trace vector decoder exception handler decodes the upcoming instruction located outside the exception, as well as re-encoding the previously decoded instruction. Implementations =Motorola 680x0= The Motorola 68000 has an instruction-by-instruction tracing facility. When its trace state is enabled, the processor automatically forces a trace exception after each (non- exception) instruction is executed. The following assembly code snippet is an example of a program initializing a trace exception handler on a 68000 system. InstallHandler: MOVE.L #$4E730000,-(SP) ; Push trace exception handler on to stack MOVE.L #$00000010,-(SP) MOVE.L #$0004DDB9,-(SP) MOVE.L #$BD96BDAE,-(SP) MOVE.L #$B386B586,-(SP) MOVE.L #$D046D246,-(SP) MOVE.L #$0246A71F,-(SP) MOVE.L #$00023C17,-(SP) MOVE.W #$2C6F,-(SP) MOVE.L SP,($24).W ; Set trace exception handler vector ORI.W #$A71F,SR ; Enable trace state NOP ; CPU generates a trace exception after executing this NOP ; ... ; Code from this line would be encrypted The following is a disassembly of the above trace exception handler loaded on the stack. The purpose of this handler is to obfuscate any traced encrypted code. Its decryption process is affected by the contents of the condition code register (CCR). For example, an arithmetic operation in the main program having the 0 number as a result, will cause zero flag bit to be set in CCR. This will cause the value in (SP) to be changed in the trace exception handler. TraceHandler: MOVE.L (2,SP),A6 ; Load return address from supervisor stack MOVE.W (SP),D6 ; Load condition codes of the main program AND.W #$A71F,D6 ADD.W D6,D0 ADD.W D6,D1 EOR.L D1,D6 EOR.L D2,D6 EOR.L D6,(A6) ; Decode 8 bytes ahead in main EOR.L D6,(4,A6) RTE ; Return from exception =Intel x86= The x86 CPUs provide a trace flag that generates an interrupt after the execution of each instruction.

It is a designated Grade I listed building and has been described as being \\"the earliest major railway viaduct in the world\\". In 1826, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company (L&MR;) was authorised to construct the world's first intercity railway. One obstacle on the selected 50 km route between Liverpool and Manchester was the Sankey Valley. The company's principal engineer, George Stephenson, designed the Sankey Viaduct for the double-track railway to traverse the valley and Sankey Canal with sufficient clearance for the masts and sails of the Mersey flats that used the canal. The viaduct was built between 1828 and 1830, although work on the structure did not finish until the middle of 1833. On 15 September 1830, the viaduct was opened along with the Liverpool & Manchester railway. During 2015, Network Rail installed overhead line equipment as part of a wider electrification programme. History =Background= 1831 view of the Viaduct In 1826, the Act for the Liverpool & Manchester Railway (L&MR;), the world's first intercity railway, was passed by Parliament. George Stephenson, was the company's principal engineer for the 50 km route between Liverpool and Manchester. The route required crossing the Sankey valley west of Newton-le-Willows, about half way along the line. The Sankey valley contained two obstacles, the Sankey Brook and the Sankey Canal that was constructed to link the St Helens coalfield to the River Mersey. The engineered waterway, could be regarded as the first canal built in England since Roman times. To traverse the Sankey Valley, Stephenson had to devise a route for the railway to pass without obstructing barges on the canals and maintain gradients for steam locomotives using the route. The Sankey Brook Navigation Company objected to the Liverpool & Manchester Railway's intended route and insisted that any structure across the valley must provide a minimum clearance of 18.3 meters above the water to allow fully-rigged Mersey flats to pass underneath. Stephenson's solution was to construct an embankment on the west side of the valley, roughly 823 meters long, and then cross the brook and the canal on a viaduct that met a smaller embankment on the eastern side. Stephenson designed the viaduct in conjunction with Thomas Longridge Gooch, his chief draughtsman. Constructed from yellow sandstone and red brick, the viaduct is of nine round-headed arches carried on piers that incline sharply from the base towards the top. Its form is similar to the traditional designs of canal aqueducts. =Construction= Etching of the Sankey Viaduct, 1868 Work commenced on the embankment for the western approach in June 1827. The embankment was constructed of more than 100,000 tonnes of clay, marl and moss, which was compacted with brushwood. The clay was excavated from the sides of the valley. On completion, trees were planted to provide a natural camouflage for the structure. During the first half of 1828, William Allcard (1809‚Äì61) was appointed resident engineer for the mid section of the Liverpool & Manchester railway, which included the Sankey Viaduct and Kenyon cutting. During spring 1828, work commenced on piling for the viaduct's foundations, which was necessary because of the soft conditions of the ground. The splayed bases of the viaduct's piers are built on sandstone foundation slabs, which was quarried from the nearby Olive Mount Cutting. Each slab was founded on top of around 200 timber piles, which were between 6.1 and 9.1 metres in length. In summer 1829, the piers were completed and work began on the superstructure. By February 1830, the parapet walls had been completed. The cost of the viaduct, which was known locally as the Nine Arches Viaduct, was between ¬£45,200 and ¬£46,000.\\"Stephenson's Viaduct.\\" sankeycanal.co.uk, Retrieved: 22 May 2018. On 15 September 1830, the viaduct was opened with the Liverpool & Manchester railway. Prior to its formal opening, a number of passengers had been transported across on special excursion trains earlier. In July 1833, work on the structure included the addition of copings to the parapet walls. The viaduct stands between 18.3 and 21.3 metres above Sankey Brook. It has nine semicircular arches of 15.2 metres span, 7.6 metres rise, and is of red brick with yellow sandstone facings. The arches are supported on eight rectangular piers and abutments at either end of the structure. The curved wing walls of the abutments retain the ends of the embankments. Projecting pilasters form rectangular cutwaters, which extend up the face of the piers to form part of the parapet walls. The width between the parapets is 7.6 metres. The retaining walls of the western embankment have been strengthened by the addition of stay bolts, which extend deep inside the embankment and bolt fixings set onto the faces of the retaining walls. Concrete has been applied to some of the vertical pilasters and areas of the masonry. During 1931, the Sankey Canal was abandoned north of the viaduct. In 1963, the last navigable section closed; the waterway was subsequently infilled; the canal beneath the viaduct was infilled during 2002. During February 1966, the viaduct received grade I listed building status, attributed to its \\"international significance being the earliest major railway viaduct in the world\\".Mulligan, Simon. \\"Nine Arches Bridge set to feature in BBC One documentary.\\" St Helens Star, 27 September 2016.

The short involves Mickey's attempts to help Minnie with her yard work, despite the presence of several (anthropomorphic) twisters as foils. Synopsis While walking by Minnie Mouse's house one day, Mickey Mouse is enticed by the aroma of a cake Minnie is baking. Promised a slice if he cleans the yard, Mickey immediately jumps into raking up the fall leaves littering Minnie's lawn. While working in the yard, a small tornado named Moses as tall as Mickey comes along and makes his work more complicated: first the youngster hops into the basket and leaps over Mickey countless times before he pounds the basket in place, shaking it to check if it's snared. After he throws the leaves in, Moses pounces on him, spins him around, grabs his hat, and taunts him. Angered, Mickey pounces on the youngster Moses, who spins him around and scoots away, leaving Mickey's hat on his head. Both Mickey and the youngster have a tug'o'war on the basket until it shatters on Mickey, who is entangled. Then, Moses makes an army of leaves and marches around the house. Mickey manages to trap Moses with a sack, which he ties and punts away. The tornadoling retaliates with just 2 punches, then attempts to get away, with Mickey hot on his heels. As Mickey chases him with a rake the terrified Moses calls out for help. The mother tornado, unamused with Mickey tormenting her offspring (and unaware of what her child has been doing to Mickey), furiously pursues him. Her angry rampage causes chaos and destruction through the farm fields and grasslands until she lifts the lower portion of her gigantic body and slows Mickey's movement. When the twister finally sucks Mickey in, he is sent for a spin until he ends up falling into Minnie's water fountain. After the two tornadoes leave, Minnie, unaware of the whole incident finds her garden in a complete mess causing Mickey to get her cake thrown in his face which he proceeds to eat. Production Much of the animation of the big tornado is taken from the 1935 Mickey Mouse cartoon The Band Concert. The Little Whirlwind was the debut for a newly updated Mickey Mouse design: Mickey was given ears that worked in perspective (in lieu of his traditional, unchanging circles for ears), in addition to a slimmer body, larger head, hands and feet as well as buck teeth (the latter lasting for just two shorts; Canine Caddy was the other), and the absence of a tail. This cosmetic change was relatively short-lived, and only lasted for the duration of World War II.

Although they were to go back into the studio, differences among band members led some to part ways. The band was dropped from RCA Records. They continued to tour and released a second album via their website, Naming the Unidentified, in 2005, composed of alternative rock songs lacking the rap metal element.

Career Foster was born in Woodplumpton, Lancashire in 1797, and at an early age joined the Royal Marines. In his early career, Foster served aboard HMS York. Later, he served aboard HMS Griper in 1823 as part of the British Naval Scientific Expedition to the Arctic led by Douglas Clavering. He assisted the astronomer Edward Sabine. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1824 as a lieutenant, he joined the Northwest Passage expedition led by Captain William Edward Parry, aboard HMS Hecla. He made various scientific observations in magnetism and astronomy and pendulum measurements of gravity, for which he shared the Copley Medal in 1827 and received the rank of commander. Later in 1827 he joined the British Naval North Polar Expedition, again under the leadership of Parry. From 1828 to 1831, he was commander of HMS Chanticleer and led the British Naval Expedition to the South Atlantic, surveying the South Shetland Islands and notably Deception Island off the Antarctic Peninsula. The expedition was to survey the coasts and land formations, as well as to determine the direction of ocean currents in both hemispheres. He named the Wollaston Islands of present-day Chile, in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago, after the British chemist William Hyde Wollaston. As well as surveying coasts and ocean currents, Foster used a Kater invariable pendulum to make observations on gravity. The survey included the archipelago and island of Fernando de Noronha. Foster was given considerable assistance by the Governor, who let Foster use part of his own house for the pendulum experiments.FitzRoy, R.

A federal grand jury investigation was halted in 2002 when the prosecutor was removed from office by the George W. Bush administration. In 2002, Abramoff was retained as a subcontractor by the Guam Superior Court to lobby against a bill proposing to put the Superior Court under the authority of the Guam Supreme Court. A sum of $324,000 was paid to Abramoff through Laguna Beach, California lawyer Howard Hills by means of 36 checks of $9,000 each. On November 18, 2002, a grand jury issued a subpoena demanding that the administrator of the Guam Superior Court release all records relating to the contract. On November 19, 2002, U.S. Attorney Frederick A. Black, the chief prosecutor for Guam and the instigator of the indictment, was unexpectedly demoted and removed from the office he had held since 1991. The federal grand jury investigation was quickly wound down and took no further action. In May 2003 Black was succeeded by Leonardo Rapadas at the recommendation of the Guam Republican Party. He was confirmed without any debate. Fred Radewagen, a lobbyist who had been under contract to the Gutierrez administration, said he carried that recommendation to top Bush aide Karl Rove in early 2003.[1] In 2005, Public Auditor Doris Flores Brooks initiated a new investigation of the Abramoff contract, which proceeded. The Jack Abramoff Guam Investigation involved an alleged conspiracy by lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Anthony Sanchez, and others to conceal payments to Abramoff for lobbying against legislation in the U.S. Congress to reorganize the court system in Guam. In 2002, Abramoff‚Äôs law firm, Greenberg Traurig, was retained as a subcontractor to Howard Hills, a constitutional lawyer and territorial policy specialist who had been under contract for four years advising the Guam Superior Court on the court reorganization issue. Abramoff‚Äôs firm was hired by Hills for what was supposed to be a temporary basis at the court‚Äôs direction to lobby against a bill proposing to put the Superior Court under the authority of the Guam Supreme Court. The amount of $324,000 was paid by the Court to Abramoff‚Äôs law firm, the subcontractor, through the prime contractor, Hills, who at the time was a resident of Laguna Beach, California, and a member of the bar in both Washington, D.C. and Guam. The court sent 36 checks of $9,000 each to Hills, with written instructions to pay fees owed by the court to the firm. Hills, trusting the intentions of court official Sanchez, facilitated what he thought was a transitional contract for legitimate services between the court and Grennberg Traurig. If done to avoid the federal reporting requirements for payment transfers, this would constitute illegal 'structuring' under 31 USC 5324(a). The form of payment might also be illegal if it was used to evade federal contracting rules requiring an open tender for contracts over $10,000. However, in 2006 the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice issued a report documenting the finding by FBI investigators that no federal funds were involved and no structuring had been carried out. See, pp. 27‚Äì31, http://usdoj.gov/oig/spe/s0606a/final.pdf (If not available go to usdoj.gov, select OIG reports, search for Guam U.S. Attorney, 2006). Allegations of improper influence in the reassignment of Black and appointment of Rapadas also were addressed in the 2006 report of the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General, which concluded Black‚Äôs allegations of abuse were unfounded, and that Black had used his position to undermine Guam native candidates to replace him. (See: http://usdoj.gov/oig/spe/s0606a/final.pdf (If not available go to usdoj.gov, select OIG reports, search for Guam U.S. Attorney, 2006).) In 2005, Public Auditor Doris Flores Brooks initiated an investigation of the Abramoff contract and issued a report finding that both the Guam Superior Court and the Guam Supreme Court hired lobbyists in violation of Guam procurement rules, but that the rules did not apply to the courts' lobbying contracts. (See: p. 27, www.guamopa.com, Audit Report 05-08, December 2005.) However, based on the audit report finding that Superior Court payments to Abramoff‚Äôs law firm through Hills was intended to circumvent the procurement rules, court administrator Tony Sanchez and Hills were indicted in 2006. Charges against Hills were dismissed after investigations made evident his ethical and non-criminal intentions. Abramoff and the Grennberg Traurig law firm were also indicted in 2006 by the Guam Attorney General Office, and after the law firm paid back the $324,000 which it had received from the court, the entire case was dismissed on February 9, 2009.

The station is licensed to and operated by Steel City Media. The station's studios are located at Westport Center in Midtown Kansas City, and its transmitter is located in Independence, Missouri. History =Early years; WDAF-FM= The station first signed on in 1948 as a simulcast for WHB. Cook Paint and Varnish Company owned the station. This would only last for about two years; as FM radio was still in its infancy, the company turned in the license in 1950. Transcontinent TV signed on WDAF-FM on March 5, 1961, as a simulcast partner to the AM station (now KCSP and owned by Entercom). WDAF-FM was an NBC affiliate, with 36,000 watts of power. Taft Broadcasting took over in 1964.KCKC history In 1967, WDAF-FM flipped to Top 40. The new format aired in afternoons and nights, while maintaining a simulcast with the AM station in the morning and midday. The FM started a middle of the road format on January 15, 1968, referring to themselves as \\"Popular 102\\". The station upgraded to 100,000 watts on New Year's Day, 1971. Also that year, WDAF-FM flipped to oldies, the first time an FM station in Kansas City has attempted at the format. It began with Drake- Chenault's syndicated \\"History of Rock and Roll\\". Drake didn't actually call it oldies; they referred to the automated programming as \\"Vintage Top 40\\". WDAF-FM returned to Top 40 just 4 months later in May 1971. By 1974, WDAF-FM was leaning middle of the road again, and completely automated. =KYYS= On July 1, 1974, one of Kansas City's legendary radio stations signed on, when WDAF-FM flipped to album oriented rock, branded as \\"KY 102\\", and changed call letters to KYYS (the \\"KY\\" in the slogan refers to the first and last letters in \\"Kansas City\\"). The first (and ultimately, last) song on \\"KY\\" was \\"Too Many People\\" by Paul McCartney. KYYS became the most successful AOR station in Kansas City, hitting #1 in the ratings in 1979 when acts like Bad Company, Styx, REO Speedwagon, Bob Seger, KISS and Journey were popular, along with legendary personality Max Floyd's anti-disco speeches under the name \\"The Rock and Roll Army\\". KYYS expanded and contracted the playlist over the years as the music dictated, sometimes leaning heavy on gold material, and sometimes being more adventurous with new music, but for many years, the station went without meaningful competition. Many of the personalities spent a long time at the station, including a couple who were on the air the day the format started in 1974, and the day it ended in 1997. Great American Broadcasting (later Citicasters) bought the station in 1987. KYYS, for a time, competed with KSAS, KKCI or KXXR (all located at 106.5 FM, now the current incarnation of WDAF- FM). However, in April 1992, when KRVK flipped from AC to active rock as KQRC, this began the end of KY's long dominance in the ratings, as that station took away many listeners with new hard and modern rock that KYYS generally ignored. When the station finally started playing acts such as Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers, it was too late, and their ratings never recovered. The station also tended to avoid playing Metallica and similar heavy metal bands. By 1997, KYYS leaned very heavily on new music, playing as much of it as they could. However, this could not prevent the inevitable from happening. =Death of KY; debut of The Zone= In September 1996, after the passage of the sweeping Telecommunications Act of 1996, Citicasters merged with Jacor Communications. In June 1997, KYYS was sold off to American Radio Systems, and then to Westinghouse/CBS in September (their AM sister station, WDAF, would be sold to Entercom). On September 19, 1997, at 12:01 a.m., KYYS flipped to Modern Adult Contemporary, branded as \\"102.1 The Zone.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-09-26.pdfBrian McTavish, \\"KYYS says goodbye to old radio format; Changes in KC market underscore buyout trend in the industry\\", The Kansas City Star, September 20, 1997.KY102 farewell on 101 The Fox The first song on \\"The Zone\\" was \\"A Change Would Do You Good\\" by Sheryl Crow. KYYS' staff barely had a chance to set up the final hour of music and to say goodbye to listeners; in addition, the airstaff was let go barely an hour before the change. (In fact, the official goodbye came a week after the format change, when KYYS staff members held a midday interview simulcast on KQRC and KCFX, which were then owned by the same company.)Brian McTavish, \\"The Rock and the Fox graciously let KY say goodbye\\", The Kansas City Star, September 26, 1997. On January 16, 1998, the station's call letters changed to KOZN. The station's ratings plummeted even further, as the station's playlist sounded exactly like sister station KMXV, which airs a CHR format that, at the time, leaned heavily on alternative rock. In addition, KYYS was revived on former AC station KLTH about a month after 102.1's flip, this time as a classic rock station featuring many of KY's earlier personalities. In June 1998, CBS split off the radio division under the revived Infinity Broadcasting name, which would be renamed CBS Radio in December 2005. =Star 102= On January 4, 1999, at 5 p.m., after playing \\"Ants Marching\\" by Dave Matthews Band, KOZN began stunting with ocean sounds, as well as liners redirecting listeners to KMXV, and to listen at 9 a.m. the following day for something new on 102.1. At that time, KOZN flipped to adult contemporary, branded as \\"Star 102,\\" under new Program Director Jon Zellner (who continued to program KMXV). The first song on \\"Star\\" was \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\" by Starship.\\"Round and round KC radio stations' formats; 102.1 shifts into mainstream 'Star 102', 107.3 plays Prince to promote switch\\", The Kansas City Star, January 6, 1999.\\"KC radio scene left with...no alternatives; Ratings weren't high enough to support teen-friendly formats\\", The Kansas City Star, February 5, 1999. On February 1, KOZN changed their call letters to KSRC. \\"Star\\" competed with KUDL and KCIY, both of which were sister stations. The station also aired Christmas music during the holiday season to compete with KUDL, a tradition which would begin in November 1999. (A few times, the two stations would flip to Christmas music within hours of each other, and on occasion, KSRC/KCKC would be the first station to go all-Christmas in the United States.) It would only take a year for KSRC to beat KUDL in the ratings. Zellner left the station in 2004. In 2005, KSRC changed to a more upbeat image, dropping most soft-sounding music. Despite the new upbeat image, KSRC added John Tesh's syndicated \\"Intelligence For Your Life\\" for nights in September 2005; it lasted a few months. On January 24, 2006, the station changed call letters to KCKC, in what was reportedly a near format flip to CBS Radio's FM Talk format as \\"Free FM\\". CBS cancelled the format flip after the ratings of other Free FM stations tanked. In November 2006, Wilks Broadcasting bought the station due to CBS wanting to concentrate on major media markets. John Tesh's show soon returned to nights, and eventually, replays from the previous night aired in the afternoons. While popular for many years, both KUDL and KCKC began to decline in the Arbitron ratings after the introduction of the Portable People Meter in early 2009. KUDL, though, usually had the upper hand compared to KCKC, most likely due to that station's heritage in the market, as they have been in the format since 1977. In addition, most AC stations across the country were declining in ratings during this time period, as they have struggled to gain a younger audience. =Alice 102= During the station's annual Christmas music run on December 22, 2010, KCKC began airing promotions announcing \\"a new sound coming\\" on January 3, 2011. In addition, the station's website displayed a countdown clock to the announcement, which would take place that day at Noon. At that time, after playing \\"Same Old Lang Syne\\" by Dan Fogelberg, KCKC flipped to AAA, branded as \\"Alice 102\\". The first song on \\"Alice\\" was \\"The One I Love\\" by R.E.M..\\"Alice and Jack and KC radio history\\", The Kansas City Star, January 10, 2011. A New Sound Coming to Star 102 Kansas City Star 102 Becomes Alice 102 Initially, the format had a precise gold lean to it, mostly concentrating on rock music from the 1980s, and a wide library, with less of a focus on personalities. As the year progressed, with several music festivals hosted in the city throughout the year (especially the popular \\"Kanrocksas\\" festival at Kansas Speedway), the station added more current music. \\"Alice\\" competed with Entercom's modern rock KRBZ, Cumulus Media's classic rocker KCFX, and non-commercial AAA-formatted KTBG. Since the debut of \\"Alice\\", KCKC's ratings have hung around the 2.5 share range (#15-16) of the market. =KC102-1= On January 27, 2014, Wilks registered the domain \\"KC1021.com\\", possibly signaling another format change or altering for the first time in three years. Three days later, Wilks registered \\"Alt102.com.\\" On February 4, at 6:00 p.m., after playing Semisonic's \\"Closing Time\\", KCKC began stunting with a countdown to 3:00 p.m. the following afternoon, when the station flipped back to adult contemporary, branded as \\"KC 102.1\\". The first song on \\"KC\\" was \\"Get The Party Started\\" by P!nk.Tim Engle, \\"Radio station Alice 102 switches to 'upbeat' format\\", The Kansas City Star, February 5, 2014. Wilks Launches KC102.1 Kansas City KCKC Becomes KC102.1 When the station relaunched its AC format, it featured the \\"More Music, Variety & Fun\\" slogan, as well as an emphasis on songs from the 1980s, including \\"Totally ‚Äò80s Weekends\\" airing every weekend. On June 12, 2014, Wilks announced that it is selling its Kansas City cluster (including KCKC) to Pittsburgh-based Steel City Media.\\"Steel City Media Acquires Wilks' Kansas City\\" from Radio Insight (June 12, 2014) The sale was approved on September 26, 2014, and was consummated on September 30. Shortly after the sale was approved, KCKC dropped the all-80s weekends, reduced its focus on 80s music and included more currents/recurrents in their playlist. In addition, KCKC changed their slogan to \\"Today's Best Variety.\\" References External links * CKC Independence, Missouri Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Taft Broadcasting 1961 establishments in Missouri ","title":"KCKC"},{"id":"3825820","text":"DRBD is a distributed replicated storage system for the Linux platform. It is implemented as a kernel driver, several userspace management applications, and some shell scripts. DRBD is traditionally used in high availability (HA) computer clusters, but beginning with DRBD version 9, it can also be used to create larger software defined storage pools with a focus on cloud integration. A DRBD device is a DRBD block device that refers to a logical block device in a logical volume schema. The DRBD software is free software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2. DRBD is part of the Lisog open source stack initiative. Mode of operation DRBD layers logical block devices (conventionally named \`/dev/drbdX\`, where X is the device minor number) over existing local block devices on participating cluster nodes. Writes to the primary node are transferred to the lower-level block device and simultaneously propagated to the secondary node(s). The secondary node(s) then transfers data to its corresponding lower-level block device. All read I/O is performed locally unless read-balancing is configured. Should the primary node fail, a cluster management process promotes the secondary node to a primary state. This transition may require a subsequent verification of the integrity of the file system stacked on top of DRBD, by way of a filesystem check or a journal replay. When the failed ex-primary node returns, the system may (or may not) raise it to primary level again, after device data resynchronization. DRBD's synchronization algorithm is efficient in the sense that only those blocks that were changed during the outage must be resynchronized, rather than the device in its entirety. DRBD is often deployed together with the Pacemaker or Heartbeat cluster resource managers, although it does integrate with other cluster management frameworks. It integrates with virtualization solutions such as Xen, and may be used both below and on top of the Linux LVM stack. DRBD allows for load-balancing configurations, allowing both nodes to access a particular DRBD in read/write mode with shared storage semantics. A multiple primary (multiple read/write nodes) configuration requires the use of a distributed lock manager. Shared cluster storage comparison Conventional computer cluster systems typically use some sort of shared storage for data being used by cluster resources. This approach has a number of disadvantages, which DRBD may help offset: * Shared storage resources must typically be accessed over a storage area network or on a network attached storage server, which creates some overhead in read I/O. In DRBD that overhead is reduced as all read operations are carried out locally. * Shared storage is usually expensive and consumes more space (2U and more) and power. DRBD allows for an HA setup with only 2 machines. * Shared storage is not necessarily highly available. For example, a single storage area network accessed by multiple virtualization hosts is considered shared storage, but is not considered highly available at the storage level - if that single storage area network fails, neither host within the cluster can access the shared storage. DRBD allows for a storage target that is both shared and highly available. A disadvantage is the lower time required to write directly to a shared storage device than to route the write through the other node.  Comparison to RAID-1  DRBD bears a superficial similarity to RAID-1 in that it involves a copy of data on two storage devices, such that if one fails, the data on the other can be used. However, it operates in a very different way from RAID and even network RAID. In RAID, the redundancy exists in a layer transparent to the storage-using application. While there are two storage devices, there is only one instance of the application and the application is not aware of multiple copies. When the application reads, the RAID layer chooses the storage device to read. When a storage device fails, the RAID layer chooses to read the other, without the application instance knowing of the failure. In contrast, with DRBD there are two instances of the application, and each can read only from one of the two storage devices. Should one storage device fail, the application instance tied to that device can no longer read the data. Consequently, in that case that application instance shuts down and the other application instance, tied to the surviving copy of the data, takes over. Conversely, in RAID, if the single application instance fails, the information on the two storage devices is effectively unusable, but in DRBD, the other application instance can take over. Applications Operating within the Linux kernel's block layer, DRBD is essentially workload agnostic. A DRBD can be used as the basis of * A conventional file system (this is the canonical example), * a shared disk file system such as GFS2 or OCFS2,http://www.drbd.org/users-guide/ch-ocfs2.html * another logical block device (as used in LVM, for example), * any application requiring direct access to a block device. DRBD-based clusters are often employed for adding synchronous replication and high availability to file servers, relational databases (such as MySQL), and many other workloads. Inclusion in Linux kernel DRBD's authors originally submitted the software to the Linux kernel community in July 2007, for possible inclusion in the canonical kernel.org version of the Linux kernel. After a lengthy review and several discussions, Linus Torvalds agreed to have DRBD as part of the official Linux kernel. DRBD was merged on 8 December 2009 during the \\"merge window\\" for Linux kernel version 2.6.33.

It extends for from an intersection with Feura Bush Road near the hamlet of Delmar to a junction with NY 443 in the hamlet of Elsmere. The two-lane route, named Elsmere Avenue, also has an intersection with NY 32 about halfway through the route. NY 335 was assigned to its current alignment in the 1930s. Route description NY 335 northbound north of the NY 32 junction NY 335 begins at an intersection with Feura Bush Road southeast of the hamlet of Delmar in the town of Bethlehem. Although Feura Bush Road is now NY 910A, an unsigned reference route, it was once part of NY 32. From Feura Bush Road, NY 335 heads northward as a two-lane street named Elsmere Avenue, passing several housing tracts in an otherwise open area of the town. After a half-mile (0.8 km), the route meets the Delmar Bypass, a four-lane divided highway carrying NY 32 through Bethlehem. Past the bypass, NY 335 traverses dense residential neighborhoods on its way to the hamlet of Elsmere, one of several communities located along NY 443. In Elsmere, the route runs along the east side of Bethlehem Cemetery on its way to a junction with Kenwood Avenue, a local east‚Äìwest street that becomes NY 140 at a junction less than to the west in the adjacent hamlet of Delmar. Continuing on, NY 335 serves two more blocks of homes before passing under an overpass that once carried a Delaware and Hudson Railway line. The abandoned overpass serves as a divider between the residential section of the community and Elsmere's central business district, where NY 335 ends at a junction with NY 443 (Delaware Avenue) one block north of the old railroad bridge. History On May 11, 1914, the state of New York awarded a contract to rebuild Elsmere Avenue to state highway standards. The project cost $18,489 (equivalent to $ in ), and the reconstructed road was added to the state highway system on October 27, 1914, as unsigned State Highway 1184. It did not receive a posted designation until the 1930s, when it was designated NY 335\\\\. At the time, the route connected to NY 32 at Feura Bush Road. In 1959, the state of New York developed plans for the Delmar Bypass, which would intersect NY 335 a short distance north of Feura Bush Road. The Bethlehem Central Board of Education had called for a grade- separated interchange between the highway and NY 335 to ensure the safety of school buses on the latter road, a major bus route; however, the junction was ultimately built as an at-grade intersection. The Delmar Bypass was opened in December 1963, connecting Elm Avenue in the west to U.S. Route 9W in the east. The state did not add traffic lights to any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary. In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic lights to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. This request was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed route number until the 1970s when NY 32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY 335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end.

Donald falters on the fairway while his caddies Huey, Dewey, and Louie all try to \\"tee\\" him off, with a grasshopper and a bag of trick clubs. Plot Donald Duck is taking his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie to a golf course to play golf. After his nephews build a stand made of sand, Donald prepares to swing but is interrupted by a tweeting songbird. Donald tells the bird to be quiet and it does. Before Donald can swing, he is interrupted again, this time by his nephews blowing into tissues. Angrily, Donald hushes them and sticks clips on their bills, only to have them thrown off and hit Donald (one in the tail). In a rage, Donald breaks his club and is offered a trick club by his nephews. Donald hits the golf ball only to find out that the \\"club\\" is actually a net and the ball is in the net right behind him. Donald gets another trick club which becomes an umbrella, creates a fake rainstorm, and pops out a fake bee. Unable to stand the tricks any longer, Donald orders his nephews off the field. They soon find a grasshopper, however, and put it in a ball to make another trick for Donald. When Donald hits the ball, it bounces away all by itself instead of rolling. Donald chases after it and drives it into the golf pond. Huey, Dewey, and Louie offer him a raft to follow it but before Donald can catch the ball, they pull a valve making the raft deflate. Donald falls into the pond headfirst and tries to hit the ball from underwater. He hits it out of the water and follows it, only to discover that there's a grasshopper in it. The grasshopper bounces away and Donald follows, only to be trapped when his deflated raft (which he is still wearing around his waist) ties up around him after he trips. His nephews then begin playing their own game, hitting their balls between poles (and using Donald's head as a bounce-off stand) to get them into the holes. In a rage after they walk over him, Donald breaks free of the raft and throws his club at them, intending to hit them on the heads, but it bounces back and hits him instead, throwing him into the hole and leaving him shouting in rage (from inside the hole).

The horse should rise up through its back, stretching its neck forward and down, when it reaches the peak of his jump. Ideally, the withers are the highest point over the fence. This is often described as the horse taking the shape of a dolphin jumping out of the water. Bascule can also refer more generally to the raising of the withers while the horse is in motion. Importance of bascule A horse with bascule is one with a \\"round\\" jump, while a horse with poor bascule may jump \\"flat\\" with his head in the air and his spine relatively straight. A hollowed back over the fence tends to prevent the animal from lifting his forearms very high, thus preventing the necessary tucking motion of his front legs to jump clear. Most naturally talented jumpers have good bascule. However, there are several very athletic horses that can jump great heights with considerably poor bascule due to sheer power. Some bascule is an important trait for all jumping horses, as it is more mechanically efficient for clearing high obstacles. Good bascule is desirable in show jumping, but is essential in the show hunters, being one of the main qualities that a judge looks for in the horse. Less of a bascule is desirable in other disciplines, such as eventing, when the added roundness would result in the jump taking a longer time (adding valuable seconds to the clock). Additionally, some cross-country jumps are best jumped flat, to ensure an appropriate landing. For example, drops are best jumped with little bascule, so that the landing is made as short as possible, putting less stress on the horse's legs and the rider's balance. In sports such as steeplechase, bascule is not desirable, because of the added time it takes to jump the fence. Therefore, the horses are encouraged to jump flatter and \\"out of stride.\\" Furthermore, the extra energy required for a horse to bascule over a hurdle in steeplechasing would be wasted. A \\"flat\\" jump is often desirable in hunt seat equitation. A jump with a great deal of bascule is challenging to ride, and is said to \\"pop the rider out of the tack,\\" which means it \\"pops\\" them out of the saddle. In a competition where the appearance of ease is critical, a flat jump can benefit the rider. Training for bascule These steeplechasers jump flat, without bascule, to save time and energy. Good training can help to develop a horse's bascule to its fullest potential, but overall trainers are limited in how much they can train in this innate ability. Grid work is usually most helpful in developing the animal's bascule. Certain jumps tend to favor good bascule, most notably the ascending oxer. Other jumps, such as steeplechase fences which are meant to be brushed through, favor a flat jump. In the case of the steeplechase fence, it is detrimental for the horse to have a powerful, round jump, because it consumes time and energy. Additionally, the ability to bascule over a fence is a matter of flexibility in the horse. In some cases, a more relaxed atmosphere or improved conditioning may help the horse to flex his spine better. In general, training cannot compensate for a lack of natural bascule in a horse.

In the 1930s Franz Boas was one of the first scientists to become aware of the immense prestige and influence of scientists in that era. Even at his advanced age Boas wanted to find a way to use the influence of scientists to promote human welfare. At Columbia University he collaborated with Ruth Benedict, Leslie Dunn, Robert Lynd, Walter Rautenstrauch, Harold Urey and other members of the University Federation for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom to find a unifying political position that would bring scientists of all disciplines together on a common front. He decided antifascism was such a position, and based on his collaborations wrote the Manifesto on Freedom in Science. In 1938 the Manifesto was released with 1,284 signatures of prominent scientists, including Roger Adams, Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (see: Einstein Letter to LBCDIF). Boas used the excitement generated by the Manifesto to launch the LBCDIF. Twenty-six meetings were organized to uphold the principles of the Manifesto, and the success of these meetings encouraged the organizers to expand the Birthday Committee to an ongoing group called the American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom (ACDIF).

He was unusual for an ukiyo-e artist, as he was based in the imperial capital of Kyoto. He did prints of actors, but gained note for his works concerning women. His Hyakunin joro shinasadame (Appreciating 100 women), in two volumes published in 1723, depicted women of all classes, from the empress to prostitutes, and received favorable results. Life and career Hanging scroll by Nishikawa Sukenobu, ca. 1700s. Nishikawa Sukenobu was born in Kyoto in 1671 and studied painting there under Kan≈ç Ein≈ç of the Kan≈ç school of painting; he may also have studied under Tosa Mitsusuke of the Tosa school. Sukenobu's earliest known works are book illustrations that date to 1699; the earliest signed in his name is the seven-volume Shin Kanninki (\\"New patience story\\"). While most ukiyo-e artists were based in Edo (modern Tokyo), Sukenobu spent his career in Kyoto. Sukenobu specialized in depictions of female beauties from different classes in their daily lives. He also produced books of kimono patterns, Musha-e portraits of warriors, illustrations of classical literature, and paintings. Sukenobu died in Kyoto on 20 August 1750. He was also known under the names Uemon, Jitokus≈ç, Jitokusai, Bunkado, Uky≈ç, Sai≈ç.

In this cartoon short, Mickey has a Through the Looking-Glass-type dream that he travels through his mirror and enters a topsy-turvy world where everything is alive. While there, he engages in a Fred Astaire dance number with a pair of gloves and a pack of cards, until the cards chase him out of the bizarre world. It was the 83rd Mickey Mouse short film to be released, the fourth of that year. The title is written as Thru the Mirror on the title card, but the alternative spelling Through the Mirror is used on the poster for the film. In addition, the short film is a parody of the book, Through the Looking Glass, by Lewis Carroll. Synopsis Mickey falls asleep after reading Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll. An astral projection of himself (presumably Mickey in his dream state) leaves his body and passes through his mirror into an alternate version of his house. His furniture and possessions have come to life and are complete with faces and personalities, but most of them remain motionless. He jumps on a rocking chair that throws him off in annoyance while a nearby coat rack watches in surprise, and lands on the footrest that behaves like a puppy while Mickey rides on it like a horse until it jumps into the rocking chair. While the chair tries to calm down the footrest, Mickey tries to comfort them, only to end up angering them instead. He bumps into an umbrella, who scolds him until it suddenly drops open and recloses itself in embarrassment before returning to where it originally was. Mickey then comes across a nut cracker breaking open a walnut, who then offers it to him while it eats the shells. After eating the walnut, Mickey's lower body commences to wildly spin around, and it hits his face. While his lower body crazily spins, he suddenly becomes gigantic and then shrinks. The telephone suddenly rings and it throws its receiver down to Mickey, who uses it to climb up to the table. He attempts to answer the call, only to get responses from the phone itself and then proceeds to jump rope with the telephone, who uses its receiver and wire as a jump rope while the radio begins playing music. Mickey begins to dance his way through his house, tap dancing on a top hat (wearing a tiny one with a match for a cane) with some gloves (eventually he gets his butt kicked twice by the gloves), playing cards (some of them hit Mickey's butt during the dance), and eventually the Queen of Hearts card (who resembles Greta Garbo). The joker on his bicycle notices and alerts the King of Hearts who uses the joker's bike to get down there and pulls the queen aside before proceeding to fight for his lady in a sword duel with Mickey, who uses both a sewing needle and a button as a makeshift sword after the King of Hearts pushes him and gets his butt stabbed by the needle. Mickey defeats the king by pushing him into an inkwell, where a stamp takes him out and cleans him. Considering this as the last straw, the king then orders for the cards to be called out to get rid of Mickey for good and the radio acts as an alarm to summon the cards like police cars - \\"Calling all cards! Calling all cards!\\". In response, an army of cards come out from the king's throne and at the same time, a nearby drawer opens as more cards emerge from it. Chaos ensues as Mickey runs from the cards, bumping into a stack of books along the way. He picks up a fountain pen, hides in a basket of yarn, and uses the pen like a machine gun to fire ink at the cards while wearing a thimble like a helmet. The pen eventually runs out of ink, allowing the cards to pig-pile on Mickey, who then escapes in a torn sock. After being spotted, the cards give chase again and throw their pictures at him. Mickey then turns on an electric fan to blow the cards back while the telephone calls the police in panic as Mickey swings from a lamp rope and runs on a globe until he trips and falls into the globe's Bay of Bengal and is thrown out by a figure, who appears to be a small version of Neptune, by impaling Mickey's butt. He then grows back to his normal size and escapes back to the real world through the mirror where he reenters his body. Eventually, he is awakened by his alarm clock and it has all been a dream and goes back to sleep after throwing his alarm clock into a drawer.

The edifice is also known as Sant'Andrea del Vignola, after its architect Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola. It was commissioned by Pope Julius III, to commemorate Pope Clement VII‚Äôs escape from prison following the Sack of Rome, 1527. The small church on the Via Flaminia, scarcely more than a chapel, was designed by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola in 1552 and completed the following year, while Vignola was also employed by Julius nearby at the Villa Giulia. Sant'Andrea was the first church with an elliptical dome and the first step toward the Baroque world of elliptical forms. Interior Floor plan, front elevation. The interior space is vividly expressed on the exterior. The tempio as it was long called, is an unadorned cube with a dentilled cornice without a frieze, surmounted by an elliptical low dome masked by a high plain drum with a comparable frieze, all in the gray pietra serena more usual to Tuscany than Rome. Applied to the street front is an extremely flat pedimented temple front, whose unadorned frieze is continued alone round the sides of the building, dividing the cube in the proportions 2:3. Very flat Corinthian pilasters, doubled at the corners, divide the applied facade in three bays, with shell-headed niches flanking the door. Inside there are frescoes by Girolamo Siciolante da Sermoneta and Pellegrino Tibaldi. Julius had the church engraved, plan, elevation and in perspective (G. Vasi 1761). After being long neglected, the unadorned geometry of the structure began to have an appeal to the popular Neoclassical style.

Reamer was born in and spent his early life in Oberlin, Ohio.Quinn, p. 15 He left home at the age of thirteen and went to work in an architect's office in Detroit as a draftsman. By the age of twenty-one, Reamer had moved to San Diego and had opened the architectural office of Zimmer & Reamer in partnership with Samuel B. Zimmer. The firm produced a wide variety of projects, but the only surviving example of Zimmer & Reamer's work is the George H. Hill Block in the Gaslamp District.Quinn, p. 25 The partnership dissolved in 1898, but Reamer continued to work on his own, including work at the Hotel del Coronado. During this period he became acquainted with the president of the Yellowstone Park Company, Harry W. Child.  Yellowstone Park Company and the Northern Pacific Railroad  The Old Faithful Inn was commissioned in 1902 by Child, and funded with loans from the Northern Pacific Railway, using laborers who were experienced railroad trestle builders. Child introduced Reamer to Charles Sanger Mellen, president of the Northern Pacific.Quinn, p. 39 Northern Pacific Railway Terminal Postcard, F. Jay Haynes While he was carrying out design work on the Old Faithful Inn for Child, Reamer was also designing the Gardiner, Montana depot for the Northern Pacific, at the northern entrance to Yellowstone National Park. The depot and the Inn were complementary projects, and similar in style. The depot opened first, in 1903, and embodied many design features that Reamer explored on a grander scale at the Old Faithful Inn. = Old Faithful Inn = Postcard of Old Faithful Inn by F. Jay Haynes The Old Faithful Inn is a National Historic Landmark, honored as the inspiration for a rustic style of architecture popular throughout the western United States. The rustic style is sometimes considered a branch of the Arts and Crafts movement, which emphasized fine, hand-hewn details and harmony with the surrounding environment. It became so popular at western National Parks that it is sometimes referred to \\"parkitecture\\". At the Old Faithful Inn, the pitched roof is covered in yard-long redwood shingles, which laid the foundations for the ‚Äúshingle-style‚Äù known today. The roof shape echoes the shape of surrounding mountains. Inside, a spectacular, six-story lobby features native lodgepole pine balconies, and it is anchored by a 500-ton rhyolite chimney and fireplace. Reamer carefully placed windows to mimic light filtering through a canopy of pine trees. Furniture was provided by the Old Hickory Furniture Company of Indiana, whose 100-year-old dining room chairs are still in use today. =Lake Yellowstone Hotel= At the same time that Reamer was building the Old Faithful Inn from the ground up, he was also overseeing the expansion of the Lake Yellowstone Hotel. In complete contrast to the Old Faithful Inn, the Lake Yellowstone Hotel was originally an austere clapboarded barn-like structure. Reamer added Greek Revival porticoes and sparely-detailed trim. H.W. Child Residence, Mammoth Hot Springs in 1917 = Personal tragedy = After the major work of 1903, Reamer spent ensuing years designing and supervising a variety of supporting buildings and residences around Yellowstone, particularly in Mammoth Hot Springs and Gardiner. In 1906, he developed a proposal for Child for a huge hotel for Mammoth that was to foreshadow the Canyon Hotel.Quinn, p. 60 However, in 1906 Reamer's wife Mabel died at age 30, of Bright's disease. Reamer's alcoholism, which had previously been noted, became acute, and he apparently returned to live with his family for the next two years.Quinn, p. 64 Reamer returned to Child and Yellowstone in 1908 and prepared yet another proposal for a grand hotel at Mammoth as well as a variety of lesser buildings for the Yellowstone Park Association.Quinn p. 68 In 1909, Reamer accompanied the Childs on a tour of European hotels, apparently in preparation for future work. Reamer (left) and foreman at the Canyon Hotel construction site = Canyon Hotel = In 1910, Reamer presented designs for a new hotel to be located at Canyon Village, adjacent to the Yellowstone Falls and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, to be known as the Canyon Hotel. This hotel incorporated portions of a previous hotel, built in 1891, and was 750 feet long with 400 rooms and 100 baths. Occupying a prominent site on a hillside, it was built in the winter of 1910-1911.Quinn, p. 75 The design bore a close resemblance to Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie style work, with a strong horizontal emphasis and a commanding roofline.  Expanding practice  Reamer relocated to Cleveland in 1912 and began a series of commissions with railroads, building on his experience with the Northern Pacific. A proposed summit hotel on Mount Washington for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1912 never came to pass, but work for the Maine Central Railroad at Augusta, Maine and the Union Station in Clinton, Massachusetts did proceed.Quinn, p. 88-90 At the same time, Reamer designed additions to the Mammoth Hotel and the Old Faithful Inn.  Seattle  By 1918, Reamer had remarried and relocated to Seattle.Quinn, p. 103 Over the next few years, Reamer established a new practice, beginning as a staff architect with the Metropolitan Building Company.Quinn, p. 106 With the company, he designed several buildings, including the Seattle Times Building in 1930. Once out on his own, he continued his hotel work with a series of eight hotels in Washington. The most notable of these was the Lake Quinault Lodge, constructed in 1926 on the Olympic Peninsula.Quinn, p. 111 Later, Reamer began to specialize in movie theaters, working in the elaborate thematic styles popular at the time. The 1926 5th Avenue Theatre was part of the MBC's Skinner Building project in Seattle, with a Chinese-inspired interior. The Moorish-inspired Mount Baker Theatre opened in Bellingham, Washington in 1927. An Art Deco Fox theater in Spokane followed in 1931, with another Fox in Billings, Montana the same year.Quinn, p. 129-132 During the same period, Reamer designed the 15-story 1411 Fourth Avenue building in Seattle, as part of a series of commercial buildings.Quinn, p. 141 Return to Yellowstone Reamer expanded and altered his hotels at Yellowstone with a series of additions and alterations to the Old Faithful Inn, Canyon Hotel, Mammoth Hotel and the Lake Yellowstone Hotel from 1926 to 1936. Most notably, the Old Faithful Inn was expanded to include the present dining room and Bear Pit Lounge, and the Lake Yellowstone Hotel received a modest addition facing Yellowstone Lake that is known today as the Reamer Lounge. Reamer also added a dining room and lounge to the Mammoth Hotel. The Map Room Lounge includes seventeen-by-ten-foot map of the United States, made of inlaid wood by Reamer and his associate W. H. Fey.Quinn, p. 159  Legacy  Reamer's second wife, Louise Chase Reamer, niece of Yellowstone National Park Commissioner John W. Meldrum, died of ovarian cancer in 1933.Quinn, p. 169 In 1935, Reamer began to experience health problems that led to the amputation of a leg in 1937.

Life and sports He was born at Carson C. Peck Memorial Hospital on December 12, 1937 to long-time Dodger owner Walter Francis O'Malley (1903‚Äì79) and Katherine Elizabeth \\"Kay\\" Hanson (1907‚Äì79). Peter has a sister, Theresa \\"Terry\\" O'Malley Seidler (born 1933), who was co-owner of the team. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where he was president of his fraternity Phi Gamma Delta, and from the Wharton School of Business in 1960. In 1962, Peter was named the director of Dodgertown, the team's spring training headquarters located in Vero Beach, Florida. In 1965, he became president and general manager of the minor league Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League, where many future Dodger stars and coaches were on the roster. In 1967 he moved to the major league club as vice president of stadium operations and in 1969, as executive vice president.https://www.baseball- reference.com/bullpen/Peter_O%27Malley Peter took over the presidency of the Dodgers from his father on March 17, 1970. His father, Walter, who had been Dodger Chairman of the Board since that date, passed away on August 9, 1979. On March 19, 1998, Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation acquired the team for what was alternately reported as $311 million or $350 million (equivalent to $ to $ million in ). This was the highest price ever paid for a US sports franchise at the time. Peter O'Malley relinquished the club presidency to become Dodger chairman of the board;https://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/29/sports/sp-37177 he resigned that post at the end of the 1998 baseball season. Murdoch appointed NewsCorp subsidiary's Fox Television executives to oversee the Dodgers, with mixed results. The sale was reported as an estate and tax planning move for the O'Malley family, as Terry had ten children and Peter three. None had immediately emerged as a candidate to succeed Peter, and he acknowledged that the new economics of the game had dictated that the days of family baseball ownership, without support of a separate corporation, were largely over. NewsCorp sold the Dodgers in 2004 for $430 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to Frank McCourt, a Boston developer. In 1996, after earlier consideration and partly owing to a phone call from Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on August 22, 1995 at 3:25 p.m.,https://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-12/news/mn-64750_1_dodger-stadium Peter O'Malley met with NFL officials to discuss the possible construction of a football-only stadium on Dodger-owned property surrounding Dodger Stadium. His plan offered solutions to a number of problems faced by the NFL in locating a team in Los Angeles, following the departure of both the Rams and the Raiders. First, it provided for scarce, centrally-located land. Second, the proposal came attached to highly regarded, established sports franchise management via the O'Malley involvement. Third, like Dodger Stadium, the new facility would be privately financed, and thus not entangled in lengthy municipal funding debates. Fourth, the plan called for alignment with an expansion team, meaning that no existing franchise would have to be moved. Published reports indicated that O'Malley spent upwards of $1 million on an initial round of architectural renderings, land use studies and environmental impact research, and quickly garnered substantial support among NFL owners who would have to vote their approval. As meetings continued over the next year, O'Malley received a call from Mayor Riordan, asking him to cease pursuit of the NFL franchise. The city had decided that the team should play in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, already more than 70 years old, and absent any of the considerable amenities now standard in NFL stadiums. O'Malley reluctantly shelved his work and withdrew, noting that while he believed strongly in the viability of his proposal, \\"you can't fight City Hall.\\" The Rams, however, would return to Los Angeles from St. Louis in 2016; a year later, the Chargers also relocated to Los Angeles from San Diego. Hallmarks of Peter O'Malley's baseball career were his deep involvement in the U.S. Little League program as longtime chairman of the Little League Foundation,http://www.littleleague.org/Page56571.aspx his contribution to baseball's introduction as an Olympic sport, and his years of promotion of baseball globally, particularly in Latin America, Japan, and China, where a donation he made provided for construction of the country's first baseball stadium in 1986. Named Dodger Stadium, it is in the coastal city of Tianjin. He also funded the building of the O'Malley baseball fields in Managua, Nicaragua (1992),https://www.jackierobinson.org/people/peter-omalley/ Corkagh Park in Clondalkin, West Dublin, Ireland (1998), considered the main home of Irish baseball. He believed that these initiatives would bolster baseball's popularity around the world, while also benefiting both the Dodgers and the future of American baseball in general. He has been widely credited with running the Dodgers as a professional, highly respected and emulated organization, operated with consistent methods and values, encompassed by a style known as \\"The Dodger Way.\\" Among his unique business practices were treating his staff to ice cream at 2 p.m. every day that the Dodgers were in first place, freshly baked cookies on sell-out games, and overseas trips in the off-season after particularly successful years. In 1997, Fortune magazine named the Dodgers as the only sports franchise selected as one of the \\"100 Best Companies to Work for in America.\\" It was the third time the Dodgers had received the recognition, after being named in books of that title in 1984 and 1993.http://www.malibuchronicle.com/shades-of-dodger-blue/ On November 2, 2011, a day after the announcement that Frank McCourt would be selling the Dodgers, O'Malley expressed his interest in repurchasing his former team. He withdrew his bid on February 21, 2012.Peter O'Malley reportedly out as bidder for Dodgers The inclusion of Historic Dodgertown ‚Äì Vero Beach, Florida on the U.S. Civil Rights Trail is significant, as it is the only sports institution to receive this recognition. The U.S. Civil Rights Trail is a collection of churches, courthouses, schools, museums and other landmarks primarily in the Southern states where activists challenged segregation in the 1950s and 1960s to advance social justice. Historic Dodgertown was added and announced on January 31, 2019. In the 1940s, Dodger management, led by Branch Rickey and Peter‚Äôs father and partner, Walter O‚ÄôMalley, took the bold step to break Baseball‚Äôs color barrier. In 1947, the Dodgers signed Jackie Robinson, the first African-American since 1884 to sign a Major League Baseball contract. Robinson made his Dodgertown debut on March 31, 1948 and hit a home run in his first at-bat. The Dodgers signed five of the first six African-American players of the 20th century to professional baseball contracts. Dodgertown was unique because in addition to being teammates and training on the playing fields, all the players dined together, shared living quarters in barracks and had recreational opportunities on site, a former U.S. Naval Air Station base, which closed after World War II. In 1962, Dodgertown Director Peter O‚ÄôMalley removed the concept of segregated seating, water fountains and bathrooms in Holman Stadium at Dodgertown, despite the prohibitions in the South. Local schools were not integrated until 1969. ‚ÄúDodgertown, Vero Beach played a pioneering role in advancing rights for African-Americans starting in 1948 and continuing throughout the 1950s and 1960s,‚Äù said Peter O‚ÄôMalley, President, Los Angeles Dodgers (1970-1998). ‚ÄúAll of us connected to Dodgertown and its legacy are extremely proud of this well-deserved recognition by the U.S. Civil Rights Trail organization.‚Äù Honours * ribbon bar Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd Class, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon (2015) *Named an ‚ÄúHonorary Citizen of Tianjin of the People‚Äôs Republic of China‚Äù by the People‚Äôs Government of Tianjin (1991) *Appointed member, Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee Board of Directors (1979)https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/63222421/ *Inducted into the Irish-American Baseball Hall of Fame, New York (2013)http://m.mlb.com/news/article/46868108/joe-mcewing-enters-irish- american-baseball-hall-of-fame/ *Medallion of Merit from the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, Los Angeles (2013)http://www.irishbaseballhall.net/class-of-2013 References Los Angeles Dodgers executives Los Angeles Dodgers owners Major League Baseball executives Major League Baseball owners Major League Baseball team presidents Peter 1937 births Living people People from Brooklyn Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania alumni University of Pennsylvania alumni ","title":"Peter O'Malley"},{"id":"3825939","text":"The Lafayette Journal & Courier is a daily newspaper owned by Gannett, serving Lafayette, Indiana, and the surrounding communities.

The float (turtle) is a b-boying move originally coming from basic Gymnastics alongside variants specifically the Turtle. Though it appears to demand great strength, the float actually requires balance above all because the breaker's weight is supported on the elbows which are firmly planted (\\"stabbed\\") into the lower abdomen near the anterior superior iliac spine. Stationary floats are often employed as freeze poses. On the other hand, breakers can \\"walk\\" with floats by shifting weight from one hand to the other and thus moving in a straight line or circle. These moving floats can be made to spin very fast and become the first power moves that were done in the 80's. Variants *Crab - The Crab is a specific term for a two-handed stabbed float that may walk in a line but does not entail any of the variations below. *Turtle AirFlares/Criticals - This move is considered a combination of an AirFlare, and a Cricket; however this move is performed during a turtle/handglide freeze. The legs rotate as if doing a windmill and the breaker pumps off the ground and spins. The breaker then lands in the stabbing position again. *Turtle Freeze - A stationary Turtle. *Handglide Freeze - A stationary Handglide =Spinning floats= *Turtle - This is a standard spinning float. The breaker shifts weight from one hand to the next, moving one hand forward and the other backward to produce rotation or a circular \\"walk\\". Pumping Turtle or Darkhammers - A Turtle in which the breaker actually hops/jumps with the hands instead of just shifting from hand to hand. *Handglide - A one-handed Turtle. *Cricket - Much like the Handglide, but the breaker hops on the central hand rather than merely spinning. The free hand pulls until the centered wrist becomes taut and can twist no further. The free hand pushes off from ground (and the legs may kick upward as well), allowing the centered hand to hop and turn itself to allow for the process to repeat. Bboy Pop of Gamblers crew is famous for his beautiful crickets as well as jackhammers (see below). Jackhammer/Hydro - A Cricket performed with one hand. Jackhammers are often faster, and the free hand is usually placed on the back or in some other position that clearly shows control with the centered hand. Many world records have been conducted on the number of Jackhammers a bboy could do, with a top record of 113 in a row by Bboy RYUTA. *Airchair Spin - A floating chair freeze; however, the breaker is spinning upon the grounded hand. This move can usually be located during a breaker's Flare or Airflare/Airtrack set. Those powermoves are commonly used to exert proper momentum to do such floats. Chair Flares - A flare variation, pumping with the stabbing arm from airchair position while maintaining the motion of flares. These are not usually used in rapid succession, but incorporated into a bboy/bgirl's performance. =Straight-arm floats= Floats may be performed with arms locked straight, meaning the elbows do not support the body. Rather, these floats involve strength and speed to keep the entire body up. To assist this extremely difficult athletic move, often the legs bend upwards, the body leans forward slightly, and/or the hands are turned in the direction of spin. *UFO or Air Turtle - Movement is like that of a turtle, with legs pointing back, except that arms are extended and locked. Knees may be bent or legs may flail outward. Reverse UFO - A UFO float executed with hands behind the back, near the bottom. Buddha - Similar to Air Turtles except that the knees are kept locked together and behind the arms, shins parallel to the floor, back as parallel to the floor as possible. Bboy Waka of Headhunterz was one of the first to perform Buddhas in his sets. Deadman - Similar to UFOs where the legs are held straight together. It is a commonly seen movement done in gymnastics floor routines. Bboy Junior is a famous bboy who is known to use Deadman floats in his sets. *Boomerang - While sitting with legs in front and in a V shape, the hands are placed in between the thighs. The legs are lifted and kept straight while the hands walk in a circle. This looks quite different from most other floats.

This activity is extremely dangerous because optimum highmark terrain is typically in areas where avalanche danger is extremely high. Snowmobilers are the recreation group most likely to be killed in an avalanche, largely due to the activity of highmarking. According to the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center, \\"Avalanche victims are almost exclusively backcountry recreationistssnowmobilers, climbers, snowboarders, snowshoers, skiers and hikers. Snowmobilers lead the list with twice the number of fatalities as any other activity.\\" Highmarking is the recreational maneuver of attempting to reach the highest point of a snow-covered feature such as a mountain, on a snowmobile. It refers to a specific activity in which the snowmobile operator's main goal is to accelerate and gain maximum elevation upon the face of a mountain before the machine reaches the top of the feature or upward progress is suddenly forced to diminish because of the grade of the feature, which gives the rider no choice but to turn around. A High mark begins when a snowmobiler leaves an established trail and fully accelerates; blazing his/her own trail upward toward the summit of a snow-covered mountain face, ideally lying at a 30-45% grade. As the terrain gets steeper, the machine's acceleration slows down. At the apex of the elevation gained, the rider must sharply turn 180 degrees and descend the feature. The height of the arching track left in the snow by a pioneering rider usually sparks competition within members of a rider's party, urging the rest to surpass the height of the original arch, thus initiating a competition. High marks vary in their degrees of difficulty depending on the pitch of a given ascent and conditions of the snow. Highmarking involves serious personal injury risk factors, most notably the danger of the rider triggering an avalanche and becoming buried in the ensuing cataclysm.

The roughly 559 species in 37 genera include around 162 Lepeophtheirus and 268 Caligus species. Sea lice are marine ectoparasites (external parasites) that feed on the mucus, epidermal tissue, and blood of host marine fish. The genera Lepeophtheirus and Caligus parasitize marine fish, in particular those species that have been recorded on farmed salmon. Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species are adapted to salt water and are major ectoparasites of farmed and wild Atlantic salmon. Several antiparasitic drugs have been developed for control purposes. L. salmonis is the best understood in the areas of its biology and interactions with its salmon host. Caligus rogercresseyi has become a major parasite of concern on salmon farms in Chile, and British Columbia https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/b-c-first-nations-say-sea-lice-spreading- from-fish-farms-to-wild-salmon-1.5001953. Studies are under way to gain a better understanding of the parasite and the host-parasite interactions. Recent evidence is also emerging that L. salmonis in the Atlantic has sufficient genetic differences from L. salmonis from the Pacific to suggest that Atlantic and Pacific L. salmonis may have independently co-evolved with Atlantic and Pacific salmonids, respectively. Diversity The family Caligidae is estimated to contain around 559 species in 37 genera. The largest of these are Caligus, with around 268 species, and Lepeophtheirus with around 162 species. Wild fish Most understanding of the biology of sea lice, other than the early morphological studies, is based on laboratory studies designed to understand issues associated with sea lice infecting fish on salmon farms. Information on sea lice biology and interactions with wild fish is sparse in most areas with a long-term history of open net-cage development, since understanding background levels of sea lice and transfer mechanisms has rarely been a condition of tenure license for farm operators. Many sea louse species are specific with regard to host genera, for example L. salmonis, which has high specificity for anadromous fish including sticklebacks and salmonids including the widely farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Lepeophtheirus salmonis can parasitize other salmonids to varying degrees, including brown trout (sea trout: Salmo trutta), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), and all species of Pacific salmon. In the case of Pacific salmon, coho, chum, and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch, O. keta, and O. gorbuscha, respectively) mount strong tissue responses to attaching L. salmonis, which lead to rejection within the first week of infection. Pacific L. salmonis can also develop, but not complete, its full lifecycle on the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). This has not been observed with Atlantic L. salmonis. How planktonic stages of sea lice disperse and find new hosts is still not completely known. Temperature, light, and currents are major factors and survival depends on salinity above 25 ‚Ä∞. L. salmonis copepodids migrating upwards towards light and salmon smolt moving downwards at daybreak have been hypothesized to facilitate finding a host. Several field and modeling studies on L. salmonis have examined copepodid populations and have shown that planktonic stages can be transported tens of kilometres from their source., including how their behaviour results in their being moved towards the coastline and mouth of estuaries The source of L. salmonis infections when salmon return from fresh water has always been a mystery. Sea lice die and fall off anadromous fish such as salmonids when they return to fresh water. Atlantic salmon return and travel upstream in the fall to reproduce, while the smolts do not return to salt water until the next spring. Pacific salmon return to the marine nearshore starting in June, and finish as late as December, dependent upon species and run timing, whereas the smolts typically outmigrate starting in April, and ending in late August, dependent upon species and run timing. Sea lice possibly survive on fish that remain in the estuaries or they transfer to an as yet unknown alternate host to spend the winter. Smolt get infected with sea lice larvae, or even possibly adults, when they enter the estuaries in the spring. How sea lice distribute between fish in the wild also is not known. Adult stages of Lepeophtheirus spp. can transfer under laboratory conditions, but the frequency is low. Caligus spp. transfer quite readily and between different species of fish, and are regularly found in the plankton. Morphology L. salmonis tends to be about twice the size of most Caligus spp. (e.g. C. elongatus, C. clemensi, etc.). The body consists of four regions: cephalothorax, fourth (leg-bearing) segment, genital complex, and abdomen. The cephalothorax forms a broad shield that includes all of the body segments up to the third leg-bearing segment. It acts like a suction cup in holding the louse on the fish. All species have mouth parts shaped as a siphon or oral cone (characteristic of the Siphonostomatoida). The second antennae and oral appendages are modified to assist in holding the parasite on the fish. The second pair of antennae is also used by males to grasp the female during copulation. The adult females are always significantly larger than males and develop a very large genital complex, which in many species makes up the majority of the body mass. Two egg strings of 500 to 1000 eggs (L. salmonis), which darken with maturation, are roughly the same length as the female's body. One female can produce 6-11 pairs of egg strings in a lifetime around 7 months. Development Sea lice have both free-swimming (planktonic) and parasitic life stages, all separated by moults. The development rate for L. salmonis from egg to adult varies from 17 to 72 days depending on temperature. The lifecycle of L. salmonis is shown in the figure; the sketches of the stages are from Schram. Eggs hatch into nauplii I, which moult to a second naupliar stage; both naupliar stages are nonfeeding, depending on yolk reserves for energy, and adapted for swimming. The copepodid stage is the infectious stage and it searches for an appropriate host, likely by chemo- and mechanosensory clues. Currents, salinity, light, and other factors also assist copepodids in finding a host. Preferred settlement on the fish occurs in areas with the least hydrodynamic disturbance, particularly the fins and other protected areas. Copepodids once attached to a suitable host feed for a period of time prior to moulting to the chalimus I stage. Sea lice continue their development through three additional chalimus stages each separated by a moult. A characteristic feature of all four chalimus stages is that they are physically attached to the host by a structure referred to as the frontal filament. Differences in the timing, method of production, and the physical structure of the frontal filament are seen between different species of sea lice. With exception of a short period during the moult, the preadult and adult stages are mobile on the fish, and in some cases, can move between host fish. Adult females, being larger, occupy relatively flat body surfaces on the posterior ventral and dorsal midlines and may actually outcompete preadults and males at these sites. Feeding habits The naupliar and copepodid stages until they locate a host are nonfeeding and live on endogenous food stores. Once attached to the host, the copepodid stage begins feeding and begins to develop into the first chalimus stage. Copepods and chalimus stages have a developed gastrointestinal tract and feed on host mucus and tissues within range of their attachment. Preadult and adult sea lice, especially gravid females, are aggressive feeders, in some cases feeding on blood in addition to tissue and mucus. Blood is often seen in the digestive tract, especially of adult females. L. salmonis is known to secrete large amounts of trypsin into its host's mucus, which may assist in feeding and digestion. Other compounds such as, prostaglandin E2, have also been identified in L. salmonis secretions and may assist in feeding and/or serve the parasite in avoiding the immune response of the host by regulating it at the feeding site. Whether sea lice are vectors of disease is unknown, but they can be carriers of bacteria and viruses likely obtained from their attachment to and feeding on tissues of contaminated fish. Disease =Pathology= Gravid female Lepeophtheirus salmonis on Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar Sea lice cause physical and enzymatic damage at their sites of attachment and feeding, which results in abrasion-like lesions that vary in their nature and severity depending upon a number of factors, including host species, age, and general health of the fish. Whether stressed fish are particularly prone to infestation is unclear. Sea-lice infection causes a generalized chronic stress response in fish since feeding and attachment cause changes in the mucus consistency and damage the epithelium resulting in loss of blood and fluids, electrolyte changes, and cortisol release. This can decrease salmon immune responses and make them susceptible to other diseases and reduce growth and performance. The degree of damage is also dependent on the species of sea lice, the developmental stages that are present, and the number of sea lice on a fish. Little evidence exists of host tissue responses in Atlantic salmon at the sites of feeding and attachment, regardless of the development stage. In contrast, coho and pink salmon show strong tissue responses to L. salmonis characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation. This results in rejection of the parasite within the first week of infection in these species of salmonids. Heavy infections of farmed Atlantic salmon and wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) by L. salmonis can lead to deep lesions, particularly on the head region, even exposing the skull. =Interactions between wild and farmed fish= Some evidence indicates that sea lice flourishing on salmon farms can spread to nearby wild juvenile salmon and devastate these populations. Sea lice, particularly L. salmonis and various Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon. Sea lice migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days. Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice. When exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, mathematical models have suggested that many young wild salmon may be infected Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. Sea trout populations in recent years may have seriously declined due to infestation by sea lice, and Krkosek et al. have claimed that on the Pacific coast of Canada the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is over 80%. A few studies indicated no long-term damage to fish stocks in some locations, and a population decline in wild salmon that occurred in 2002 was caused by \\"something other than sea lice\\". However, the repeated epizootics of lice on wild fish have only occurred in areas with salmon farms in Ireland, Scotland, Norway, British Columbia, and Chile. Field sampling of copepodids, and hydrographic and population models, show how L. salmonis from farms can cause mass infestations of seaward- migrating salmonids, and this effect can occur up to from the farms. Several scientific studies have suggested that caged, farmed salmon harbour lice to a degree that can destroy surrounding wild salmon populations. Other studies have shown that lice from farmed fish have relatively no effect on wild fish if good husbandry and adequate control measures are carried out (see section: Control on salmon farms). Further studies to establish wild-farmed fish interactions are ongoing, particularly in Canada, Scotland, Ireland, and Norway. A reference manual with protocol and guidelines for studying wild/cultured fish interactions with sea lice has been published. Fish farming =Control on salmon farms= This has been reviewed by Pike & Wadsworth, McVicar, and Costello. Integrated pest management programs for sea lice are instituted or recommended in a number of countries, including Canada, Norway, Scotland, and Ireland. Identification of epidemiological factors as potential risk factors for sea lice abundance with effective sea lice monitoring programs have been shown to effectively reduce sea lice levels on salmon farms. Natural predators Cleaner fish, including five species of wrasse (Labridae), are used on fish farms in Norway and to a lesser extent in Scotland, Shetland and Ireland. Their potential has not been researched in other fish farming regions, such as Pacific and Atlantic Canada or Chile. Husbandry Good husbandry techniques include fallowing, removal of dead and sick fish, prevention of net fouling, etc. Bay management plans are in place in most fish farming regions to keep sea lice below a level that could lead to health concerns on the farm or affect wild fish in surrounding waters. These include separation of year classes, counting and recording of sea lice on a prescribed basis, use of parasiticides when sea lice counts increase, and monitoring for resistance to parasiticides. Salmon breeding Early findings suggested genetic variation in the susceptibility of Atlantic salmon to Caligus elongatus. Research then began to identify trait markers, and recent studies have shown that susceptibility of Atlantic salmon to L. salmonis can be identified to specific families and that there is a link between MHC Class II and susceptibility to lice. In October, 2012, The grocery chain Sobeys pulled whole Atlantic salmon from 84 store locations in the Canadian Maritimes after concerns were raised over sea lice. In 2017 Salmon prices in Norway increased by 15% over a 3-month period because of a Sea Lice outbreak.  Treatments  = Freshwater = Freshwater is sometimes adequate to kill the sea lice and as salmon eventually swim in fresh water, they are not harmed. =Drugs and vaccines= The range of therapeutants for farmed fish was limited, often due to regulatory processing limitations. All drugs used have been assessed for environmental impact and risks. The parasiticides are classified into bath and in-feed treatments as follows: Bath treatments There are both advantages and disadvantages to using bath treatments. Bath treatments are more difficult and need more manpower to administer, requiring skirts or tarpaulins to be placed around the cages to contain the drug. Prevention of reinfection is a challenge since it is practically impossible to treat an entire bay in a short time period. Since the volume of water is imprecise, the required concentration is not guaranteed. Crowding of fish to reduce the volume of drug can also stress the fish. Recent use of well-boats containing the drugs has reduced both the concentration and environmental concerns, although transferring fish to the well boat and back to the cage can be stressful. The major advantage to bath treatments is that all the fish will be treated equally, in contrast to in- feed treatments where amount of drug ingested can vary due to a number of reasons. Organophosphates Organophosphates are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and cause excitatory paralysis leading to death of sea lice when given as a bath treatment. Dichlorvos was used for many years in Europe and later replaced by azamethiphos, the active ingredient in Salmosan, which is safer for operators to handle. Azamethiphos is water-soluble and broken down relatively quickly in the environment. Resistance to organophosphates began to develop in Norway in the mid 1990s, apparently due to acetylcholinesterases being altered due to mutation. Use has declined considerably with the introduction of SLICE, emamectin benzoate. Pyrethroids Pyrethroids are direct stimulators of sodium channels in neuronal cells, inducing rapid depolarization and spastic paralysis leading to death. The effect is specific to the parasite since the drugs used are only slowly absorbed by the host and rapidly metabolized once absorbed. Cypermethrin (Excis, Betamax) and deltamethrin (Alphamax) are the two pyrethroids commonly used to control sea lice. Resistance to pyrethroids has been reported in Norway and appears to be due to a mutation leading to a structural change in the sodium channel which prevents pyrethroids from activating the channel. Use of deltamethrin has been increasing as an alternate treatment with the rise in resistance observed with emamectin benzoate. Topical disinfectants Bathing fish with hydrogen peroxide (350‚Äì500 mg/L for 20 min) will remove mobile sea lice from fish. It is environmentally friendly since H2O2 dissociates to water and oxygen, but can be toxic to fish, depending on water temperature, as well as to operators. It appears to knock the sea lice off the fish, leaving them capable of reattaching to other fish and reinitiating an infection. =In-feed treatments= In-feed treatments are easier to administer and pose less environmental risk than bath treatments. Feed is usually coated with the drug and drug distribution to the parasite is dependent on the pharmacokinetics of the drug getting in sufficient quantity to the parasite. The drugs have high selective toxicity for the parasite, are quite lipid-soluble so that there is sufficient drug to act for approximately 2 months, and any unmetabolized drug is excreted so slowly that there are little to no environmental concerns. Avermectins Avermectins belong to the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed treatments to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug's ability to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50 ¬µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones. Growth regulators Teflubenzuron, the active agent in the formulation Calicide, is a chitin synthesis inhibitor and prevents moulting. It thus prevents further development of larval stages of sea lice, but has no effect on adults. It has been used only sparingly in sea lice control, largely due to concerns that it may affect the moult cycle of non-target crustaceans, although this has not been shown at the concentrations recommended. =Vaccines= A number of studies are underway to examine various antigens, particularly from the gastrointestinal tract and reproductive endocrine pathways, as vaccine targets, but no vaccine against sea lice has been reported to date. Two published studies have tested vaccine candidate antigens against salmon lice, which resulted in a reduced infection rate (Grayson et al. 1995; Carpio et al. 2011). = Optical Methods = A more recent advance in the delousing strategy is to use pulsed lasers operating at the wavelength of 550 nm to delouse. Other points of interest Branchiurans, family Argulidae, order Arguloida are known as fish lice and parasitize fish in freshwater.

The class consisted of ten individual locomotives ordered from the British company of Nasmyth, Wilson and Company in 1885, but miscommunications about the weight limitations imposed on the locomotives meant they did not start work until 1887. This debacle came at a time when the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) was suffering from a lack of motive power to work on its rapidly expanding network and was part of what prompted a shift towards American and home-grown manufacturers. The classification of this class as \\"P\\" was the first example of the re-use of a classification that had previously been used for an earlier class. The members of the P class of 1876 had been sold to private companies or the Public Works Department, leaving the classification unused. The Railways Department chose to assign it to this class, setting a pattern that was followed with other classes in years to come, with the most prominent example being the A class of 1906 re-using the classification of the A class of 1873. Initially, seven of the P class locomotives were deployed in Otago, with the remaining three based in Auckland, and in 1899, the Auckland fleet expanded to four when one was transferred north from Otago. The locomotives started their lives with wooden cabs in a Gothic style, but they were later replaced with steel cabs.  In service  The P class locomotives were designed primarily for pulling freight trains. However, they were also capable of working passenger trains as required, and photographs exist of the engines occasionally pulling special excursion trains. Some changes were found necessary to obtain the best performance from them; the smokeboxes were extended, and the original Belpaire-type boilers were replaced with a new type to an NZR design. The passenger equivalent of the P class were the V class 2-6-2 tender locomotives, which were designed primarily for express passenger work. The locomotives shared a common design of boiler, which allowed boilers to be exchanged between classes during overhaul, as well as a similar design of tender. The later P class steel cab was also adapted for use on the V class. By 1926, all four Auckland members of the P class had been withdrawn from service, and the six southern members were retired within the next four years. Multiple members of the class are known to have been dumped in rivers to provide riverbank stability and halt erosion.  Preservation  Four P class locomotives have been rescued for preservation. All were salvaged from locomotive dump sites in Otago and Southland as incomplete hulks. In 1992, then-Dunedin based group Project Steam salvaged the remains of P 25 and P 107 from Beaumont on the former Roxburgh Branch. Both locomotives were moved to Dunedin for restoration; due to the poor condition of P 107's frame, the locomotive's frame was swapped with that from its sister locomotive. In 2009, the rolling chassis of P 107 was trucked from Dunedin to Springfield for storage at the Midland Rail Heritage Trust's centre, where the restoration will be completed. Both locomotives were dumped with their tenders and other fittings still attached, and so are more complete than other examples of the type. In 2004, the Ohai Railway Board Heritage Trust salvaged the remains of P 60 and P 133 from the Branxholme locomotive dumpsite on the Wairio Branch. Both were moved to the group's workshop at Wairio where they were placed in outside storage. In 2014, the hulk of P 133 was moved from Wairio to Mosgiel, pending transport to Middlemarch where it will be stored pending the funding needed to restore it to working order. Both of the ORBHT engines were more heavily stripped and are missing many parts; P 60 was also dumped with the boiler of a classmate temporarily bolted on; the boiler later came apart from the frames, resulting in the salvage of the frames only.

El Pa√≠s. Madrid sustituir√° las calles franquistas por v√≠ctimas del terrorismo Biography Born in Seville, he started his career as a worker. During the times of the Second Spanish Republic he joined the Agrupaci√≥n Anarquista union and became the head of one of its trade unions. After the outbreak of the Civil War, on December 5, 1936, Juan Garc√≠a Oliver appointed Rodr√≠guez Garc√≠a director of the prisons of Madrid, as one of the anarchists to be accepted into the government for their support of the republicans. At that post, he was responsible not only for the upkeep of the prisoners and prevention of escapes, but more importantly for prevention of lynching, proposed by numerous members of various militias. During the first months of the war, the problem of extra-legal execution of prisoners was serious and quite common. The militias and other armed groups were driven by the desire to eliminate the enemies of the Republic at all cost, and the execution of political opponents was quite common. Also, the society of besieged Madrid often reacted with violence towards the imprisoned nationalists after particularly bloody bombardments or after the press reporting of the nationalist treatment of captured republicans. The fact that the Spanish government was weak during the opening stages of the civil war did not help either. The most notable of such massacres happened after the air raid on Alcal√° de Henares air base. A group of protesters, some of whom were armed, arrived at one of Madrid's prisons, stormed the gates and demanded that the cells be opened and the nationalist prisoners be handed to the crowd. Rodr√≠guez appeared in the prison, ordered the crowd to disperse and even announced that he would rather give arms to the prisoners than hand them over to the mob. Among the saved prisoners were rightist General Valent√≠n Gallarza, notable football player Ricardo Zamora, politician Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er, Rafael S√°nchez Mazas and Raimundo Fern√°ndez-Cuesta. During his term in office, Melchor Rodr√≠guez Garc√≠a also revealed that Jos√© Cazorla Maure, a counsellor of state security of the Council of Defence of Madrid organized a net of private, illegal prisons run by the Communist Party of Spain. Later in the war he became one of Madrid's counsellors himself, on behalf of the Iberian Anarchist Federation. After the fall of Madrid in 1939, he officially passed the office to the new Francoist authorities. After the fall of the republic, Melchor Rodr√≠guez was tried for his wartime past by the victorious nationalists. However, due to the favourable testimony of many former prisoners, he was only imprisoned, while the majority of his colleagues were either exiled or executed.

A sub-brown dwarf or planetary- mass brown dwarf is an astronomical object that formed in the same manner as stars and brown dwarfs (i.e. through the collapse of a gas cloud) but that has a mass below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (about ).Working Group on Extrasolar Planets ‚Äì Definition of a \\"Planet\\" POSITION STATEMENT ON THE DEFINITION OF A \\"PLANET\\" (IAU) Some researchers call them free-floating planets whereas others call them planetary-mass brown dwarfs. Description Sub-brown dwarfs are formed in the manner of stars, through the collapse of a gas cloud (perhaps with the help of photo-erosion) but there is no consensus amongst astronomers on whether the formation process should be taken into account when classifying an object as a planet.What is a Planet? Debate Forces New Definition, by Robert Roy Britt, 2 November 2000 Free- floating sub-brown dwarfs can be observationally indistinguishable from rogue planets, which originally formed around a star and were ejected from orbit. Similarly, a sub-brown dwarf formed free-floating in a star cluster may be captured into orbit around a star, making distinguishing sub-brown dwarfs and large planets also difficult. A definition for the term \\"sub-brown dwarf\\" was put forward by the IAU Working Group on Extra-Solar Planets (WGESP), which defined it as a free-floating body found in young star clusters below the lower mass cut-off of brown dwarfs.IAU WGESP, 'Position Statement on the Definition of \\"Planet\\"', 28 February 2003 =Lower mass limit= The smallest mass of gas cloud that could collapse to form a sub-brown dwarf is about 1 Jupiter mass (MJ). This is because to collapse by gravitational contraction requires radiating away energy as heat and this is limited by the opacity of the gas. A 3 MJ candidate is described in a 2007 paper.

Power moves are loosely defined as moves relying on speed, momentum, and acrobatic elements for performance. They are prominent in B-boying, often the centerpieces of routines featuring the other elements (toprock, downrock, and freezes) that make up breaking. Power moves are closer to gymnastics than dancing. B-boys who focus heavily on power moves and execute them as a main part of their routines are often called \\"power heads\\". Origin B-boy Powerful PEX and the New York City Breakers were credited in 1983 for the B-boy style of combining 2 or 3 difficult moves together. This includes floats, Headmills aka Power windmills, and flares suicides. In the 1990s the B-boys shortened the phrase \\"powerful moves\\" down to \\"power moves\\" in the 1990s to make it sound more flashy. New generations of B-boys are executing more acrobatics, which is taking moves to the next level. Types =Spins= A b-boy performing an air chair spin, in 4X slow-motion. *Back spin: One of the first and most famous spinning power moves, the dancer is balled up and spinning on his or her back. In some variations, the dancer may choose to hop while spinning. *Shoulder spin *Air chair spin *Zulu spin *The headspin is an athletic move in which a person spins on their head from a headstand position. These may be done continuously through hand-tapping and proper balance. =Handstand moves= *The 1990 is a breakdance move which resembles a rapidly spinning one-handed handstand. Created Spinner of the Dynamic Rockers referred to as a \\"Hand Spin\\"*2000s are similar to 1990s, but with both hands. *Airflare is a breakdance move that requires the dancer to revolve hand to hand while keeping their legs in the air in a V-Formation. =Floats= Floats were one of the first power moves in the 1980s. The body is usually in a fixed position while the arms move. *Crickets and variants: Hydro, Jackhammer, Lotus Jackhammer, Super Jackhammer, Darkhammer, Hopping Turtles/Scratching Turtles, etc. *UFO, Boomerangs, Inside Boomerangs, Gorillas, Gremlin Spins/Buddha spins =Swipes= Swipes are one of the most recognizable power moves. The b-boy or b-girl leans back, whips his or her arms to one side to touch the ground, and his or her legs follow closely behind, twisting 360 degrees to land on the ground once again. *A variant is the master swipe, also known as a superman swipe or one-footed swipe Shadow Swipes is a variation of the swipe that incorporates the chair freeze to start the swipe. Created by Bboy Kid Shade of Hong Kong, it is one of his signature moves. =Windmills= The headmill is a windmill variant performed without the use of hands for stability, rotating with the head and shoulders as the pivot point. As headmills free the hands, there are many further variations defined by the positioning of the hands. Major windmill variants: *Mummies/Coffin *Nutcrackers *Eggbeaters *HandCuffs *Bellymills/superman *Confusions *Barrels/headmills *Forearms *Airplane/Highrisers/Highrises *Munchmills/Babymills *Tombstone =Flares= Flares are a widely recognized power move borrowed from gymnastics.

Life and career Baron was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1944, and received a B.A. in psychology from Harvard in 1966 and a Ph.D. from Michigan in 1970 for thesis titled The threshold for successiveness. He married Judith Baron in 1967, and has one son, David, born in 1980. Baron is the founding editor of the open-access journal Judgment and Decision Making and has been on the editorial boards of several other journals. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the Association for Psychological Science, and was the President of the Society for Judgment and Decision Making for 2006‚Äì2007. Notable contributions Baron's work has occurred primarily within the field of judgment and decision making, a multi-disciplinary area that applies psychology to problems in economics, law, business, and public policy. This field began by contrasting human decision behavior to theories of individual decision making and judgment such as probability theory and expected utility. Baron's research has extended the focus of judgment and decision making to social problems of resource allocation and ethical decisions. Among the concepts associated with his work are omission bias (the tendency for people to excuse acts of omission more easily than acts of commission) and protected values (principles on which people are unwilling to accept tradeoffs). Baron is author of Thinking and Deciding, a text that takes on the task of examining psychological research directed at a comprehension of the nature of thinking as he sees it. In this text, Baron covers such topics as risk, bioethics, Bayes' Theorem, utility measurement, decision analysis, and values. The text takes a broad-based, introductory-level view to the field of psychological decision theory, and has seen use as a textbook, both for Baron's own introductory course and for courses in decision theory at other universities. He has also authored Morality and Rational Choice, Against Bioethics, and Judgment Misguided. Additionally, he is the editor of Teaching Decision Making to Adolescents and Psychological Perspectives on Justice (with Barbara Mellers). Baron's Ph.D. students have included Jane Beattie and Jonathan Haidt.

A spin is a b-boying move that involves rotation of the breaker's body about some axis in contact with the ground. It is possible to perform a spin on virtually any part of the body, but bare skin often causes painful and spin-killing friction with the floor. To solve this problem, many breakers employ pieces of cloth or wear long clothing, pads, or caps. When the dancer uses his hands to aid in speeding up the spin, it is called tapping. A dancer may tap for a few rotations and then glide for subsequent rotations. Spins form an integral part of many breakers' routines, while others eschew them in favor of more complex- looking repeated movements, back and forth, after each rotation in a given direction. Variants *1990s and 2000s are spinning handstands sometimes considered to be power moves. The term 1990 was created by ken swift of the Rocksteady crew but the actual move of spinning on one hand was created by Spinner of the Dynamic Rockers who at the time called it a hand spin. Kenny's move was a little different where he went up on a one arm hand stand and dropped to a shoulder spin. Spinner' s move is the one that many bboys around the world have named the 1990. *Back Spin - A spin on the upper back. The legs are often tucked into the chest and the move is often linked with windmills. The current record holder for most backspins is Bboy RTHYM with a total of 83 spins. *Hand Glide - A one-armed spinning breakdance move. The breaker balances on one arm that has the elbow stabbed into the torso. The other hand pulls against the floor to spin the body in a circle. The move is usually performed with a glove to reduce friction. Sideways Hand Glide - This variation looks like a Freeze (breakdance move) but is executed on the side after the handglide pick up speed the usually go to the side. *Headspins - The body is balanced vertically with only the head in contact with the floor. This spin is perhaps the one most commonly associated with breakdancing. (Kid Freeze )Was considered the best in head spin in the early '80s the pioneer and master of headspin. *Knee Spin - A spin on one or both knees,normally usually in the kneeling position. Breakers often perform freezes or stylish movements of the upper body while spinning. *Chair Kneespin - A spin on one knee and bringing the right or left foot in front of the non spinning knee ankle of the non spinning foot is placed usually in front of spinning knee kneeling position.

Sea lion under the wharf. Sea lions on a platform underneath the wharf. The Santa Cruz Wharf is a wharf in Santa Cruz, California, United States, known for fishing, boat tours, viewing sea lions, dining, nightlife and gift shops. The current wharf was built in 1914, the last of six built on the site, and is operated by the City of Santa Cruz Parks and Recreation Office. The wharf is situated between Main Beach (which is adjacent to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk) and Cowell's Beach, on the westside of Santa Cruz City. With a length of , it is the longest pier on the West Coast of the United States. A fish market on the wharf is featured in scenes from the film Sudden Impact. History The Santa Cruz Wharf opened on December 5, 1914. The original purpose of building the wharf was for shipping potatoes to San Francisco for mining camps in the Sierra Nevada during the Gold Rush. After the innovation of motor vehicles and improved land routes, the Wharf's primary focus changed to be the base of the north Monterey Bay fishing industry. By the 1950s as Monterey Bay's sardine and other fish populations dwindled, nearly every family owned a vehicle and had money to spend on recreation. As a result, the Santa Cruz Wharf became predominately a recreational destination. Today, the wharf is still a popular tourist attraction, nestled adjacent to the city's leading attraction, Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Visitors flock to the wharf for a variety of restaurants, gift shops, wine tasting, candy stores, and just to stroll and peer down at the sea lions below. Annually, an estimated 1.5 million visitors come to the Santa Cruz Wharf to fish, shop, dine and sightsee. On October 4, 2014, the community celebrated 100 years of the Santa Cruz Wharf with a festival including a pop-up museum exhibit, historic photo stand, bocce courts, face painting, Mavericks surfboard display, photo booth, Economic Development's Wharf Master Plan model and the Surfing Preservation Society's surf shack! The festivities ended with fireworks.
